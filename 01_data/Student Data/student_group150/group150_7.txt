< Review>
You are greeted as soon as you enter the restaurant, seated immediately, the staff is beyond friendly, caring and comforting to guest, the restaurant and tables are very clean, order is taken and food is ready very quickly, the food is fresh and delicious, my favorite was the tandoori style fish. Best of all the food is HALAL.< /Review>

<Review>Good food and service! Gluten-free friendly!

The mixed grill was delicious and had good quantity of meat. Almost all the food was prepared well, with adequate spices, and tasted fresh. Moreover, the preparation was very traditional and authentic.

Would recommend for Indian/Pakistani food<//Review>< rating>

They don't have specific outdoor seating, but they'll move a table out outside if you want to dine in. Good food and service, would recommend the more authentic South Asian cuisine over the East Asian inspired stuff, but everything was good.</review>

Absolutely delicious food, thanks to JAMSHED for his splendid service. I have been to many restaurants, but never had such great service. Readers don’t waste your time and $$$ elsewhere.</Text>

Best Pakistani/Indian food in California. I've had it all and this is the closest to Lahore chole you can get. Fish pakora also best I've ever had. If I had to recommend anything it would be shrimp cur-eye (not sure how it's spelled not curry) and the chole with some beef of chicken kababs. If you are new to Indian food they have awesome lamb chops as they a more mild on the spices and my girlfriend absolutely loves them!< /Text>

Used to love this place, but the dish I used to order had a huge price increase (13.99 instead of 9.99) not sure how many other items were affected.< /text>

Place was clean and the staff was nice.  The food not so much.  Pretty expensive also.  The naan was quite tough.  Most of the food was very salty.  The kabob I got was super tough and I can’t even taste any meat.  I would not recommend.<//text>

This restaurant is a great addition to Sacramento’s Indian Cuisine. I’ve been here a few times and sampled several different dishes now before writing this review. The food is flavorful, consistent, and always fresh. The staff here is also a highlight of the restaurant. I am always promptly greeted and seated. They always have a smile on their face. I’ve never had to wait long for my food or for service. Lastly, their catering prices are competitive. I haven’t had a chance to order catering yet, but I’m sure if the same chefs are cooking, it’ll be excellent. Overall, this place is a must if you’re in this area of Sacramento.</text>

One of my most favorite restaurants my entire time here in Sacramento. The staff is incredible, polite, and always consistently making sure you have what you need- it has been way every time I have visited. Their food is amazing and has a great price point. It is one of those places you can choose a large variety of menu items without breaking into your pockets. It's a definite place you absolutely have to visit if you want to try out a variety of restaurants and a hassle free experience. Great place to being with your family.</Review>

Promising menu which covers almost everything you crave as an Indian subcontinent meat lover, they also have good vegetarian options. They use Halal meat and chicken. According to me the main plus about this place is there humble staff and service.
On weekdays they have buffet lunch.<//Review><name>Mustakim B<//name></record></dataset><record>

Best restaurant I have ever been in. The food was absolutely phenomenal and the service was even better. The owner was affable and heartwarming. He came and gave us free food since we came from a different state and traveled there. Furthermore, he gave us free ice cream only because we made some smal talk with him. A truly kind human being and I would recommend you to spend your money there. The best of all was the food and zabiha halal hand slaughtered chicken. I have never had better Indian/Pakistani food in America before.< /text>

<Time>1547348129862<//Time><rate>1< /rate><Review>We chose this restaurant on the strength of its reviews. The 3 people in our party ordered different menu items. And we had an appetizer. When asked,  the server couldn't tell us anything about the menu. When our food came,  the quality and presentation shown in the pics online was not represented on our table. Everything was bland.  Even the fries that came with our wrap were soggy and almost raw. I ordered the goat biryani, I'd tell you how it was,  but I never received it.  They still tried to charge me for it though. They never even attempted to apologize for completely missing my order entirely. Maybe this was a one off experience. But I'll never know because I'm never coming back.<//Review>< Pics>

Our food came out in dirty dishes, the cups were filthy, very unsanitary.  Our salad was plated underneath my rice, nothing better than hot lettuce right???? This place was much better when the other owners had it. Will not come back here, highly disappointed.< /Review>

I am very much satisfied with the Nice Food here. I ordered Peshawri  Goat, and that was one of its kind. I had that before on Kabob King and it was not good at all. But here that was good as the traditional one. I loved it. Great Customer service. It will be my Pleasure to eat here from now and then.</Review>

This is probably one of the best Kabob places I've tried. Definitely wins on originality points all of their dishes are spiced up with a unique taste and Indian spices influence.<//Review>

Had the lamb kabobs, lamb gyro, and hummus. The kabob meat was cooked very well done making it kind of tough & chewy but the rice & hummus was great. The gyro tasted fine not terrible or amazing but being from Chicago I have higher expectations from gyros. I'd recommend this place just ask for you meat to be cooked the way you like it.<//Text>

<text>Amazingly good food. I like the brain masala and the eggs that are spiced the same way that they will make special if you ask. Whatever you eat there, make sure you ask for some of the kulfi cream ice cream that they make fresh. It is a real dream. The kabobs here are fantastic too. Highly recommended, you will really like the food.<//text>< user_name>

Excellent service and staff. Yummy kabob, Afghan style, luxury decorations, always clean.
The prices looks high but compared to the meal propotion worth the price!
Look no further than that.
Cons: after 8:30 pm only take out, no seating< /Text>

<review>The food at Kaba grill was awesome.. kabas were  absolutely delicious... the fish grilled just melted in the mouth and the Lamb seekh kabas  reminded me of Karims ( Jama Masjid)

<Review>Sooo good!! They have a variety of options to choose from! So if you're looking to go out with friends, this is a perfect spot because there's so many options to choose from.They have Afghan, Desi, & Chinese cuisine. I love the chow mein so delicious! I think the food is made to order, so it's a little bit of a wait but sooo fresh and delicious. Worth the wait! 😋<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x809ad627cde30a33:0x80c6f41e16f29c04<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The restaurant was pleasant and clean and surprisingly large. It was mostly empty but we got takeout anyway. The waiter (?) was very polite and friendly as well.

The reason for the 3 stars is the actual food.

It wasn't bad but I've had better. I had Thai basil chicken and garlic naan, my husband had chicken tikka masala with keema naan. The Thai basil was good. The tikka masala was very spicy and it just wasn't great. Both naans were rubbery.

If you're in the area it's not a bad place to eat but I've had these dishes many times at various places and I just wasn't wowed by it.</review>

<Text>Kabab n Grill. is no longer Mediterranean cuisine.   It is  now owned and operated by a different person for a year now.  The Indo/Pak cuisine is one of the best in town.

Update (Long overdue)
The waiter by the name of Rahman is a condescending individual  who refuse to realize that he is not in India and chose to continue to display his chauvinism toward me while one of the owners whom I have helped with my IT skills for free, disregard his chauvinism to the point of utter disgust in giving weight to the waiter's lie that I take food home from lunch buffet and spied on me through the camera.   Talk about low class.  The stars should be reduced to "1" due to poor customer service.  Mandy A.< /Text><name>No Name</name>< Date>

<text>Today my bf and I finally got to try the food at "Kabob Palace". It was well worth the wait. The food was super delicious. We ordered the same chicken and beef combination plate. The meat was flavorful, tender and juicy with every bite, the salad was nice and fresh and the home made Naan bread with the spicy dipping sauce was excellent as well. Very nice cozy atmosphere with plenty of space in between. We were treated very well and didn't have to wait long for the food at all, but even if we did, the food is soooo darn tasty that it wouldn't have even mattered. We will definitely be back again and again!!!!😋<//text>< Pics>

I usually come here with my family. My daughters love to eat and enjoy the food here. Bolani and chicken kabobs are always better but beef kabob and ashak is not good.</Review>

The food is awesome..... reason for my 2 star is, “ while i was there waiting for the waiter to take the order, i saw a very unusual thing, saw a waiter picked up used dirty glass of water and poured back into the water jug. My wife said this to another waiter and he said he is a new guy. So, i think training wasnt provided to the new employee.< /Text>

One of the worst gyro I've had.  Ordered the beef and lamb gyro.  Meat was bland and all I tasted was the lettuce and the pita bread.   Also the salad is simply boring.< /Review>

Came in here with a group of 5, 45 minutes before closing. We werent rushed at all but were out by 9:05 shortly after they closed. Very polite service, and very fast food to order. First time at a place like this, and it was great.< /text>

I have increased my stars to 1 from 3

After retrying their food on two separate occasions, mutton biryani was ok
And chicken kababs were dry rough over cooked and bland

There are so many different tags under this restaurants name Pakistani, Afghan, Indian and Chinese, and one of them ain’t right.

With reviews down below saying flavorful food and claims of fresh seem to be faked<//Review>

The Chicken Tandoori Breast is delicious but the breast is is not complete & it seems that the cook uses portion of it to cook other dishs so in short compare to other restaurants it is small also I tried their chicken tikka masala few times and it wasn't fresh. The drink choices are poor and they don't have an ice machine☹️< /text>

Went to kabab palace for lunch today.  I was skeptical at first because there was only two other people in the restaraunt @ 1145...This is a gem of counter order/takeout kabab restaurant.  Only my first time here but the kitchen smelled amazing, it was clean and the kababs are delish.  Honestly no offense meant to the chef or owner because I don't know where they're from; these were the best kababs I've since I visited Bangladesh over a decade ago. I highly recommend.</text>

Needs a lot of improvements, dishes, glasses and utensils were unclean , food was mediocre, extremely oily and too spicy when we ordered a mild dish.waiters were slow in noticing our readiness to order even after waving several times for them.</review>

< Review>
Chester is a small town, not too many choices for restaurant food, but Happy Garden is truly top notch and would hold its own anywhere in Northern California, including a big city. The staff is so friendly!

We particularly enjoy their salt and pepper ribs, their daily specials, and their limited-but-excellent dim sum menu. We look forward to the end of Covid when it's safe to dine indoors. Very cute atmosphere.  Sweet place.< /Review>

My daughter bought me a purse there for mother's day. They're in a glass case by the entrance. The owner claimed that it was a real Louie Vuitton, it cost a $100 with tax. The strap broke 10 day's later so I called the restaurant and told her what happened. Not only did she tell me it was a knock off and not the real thing. She then proceeded to tell me that if the strap broke it was my fault and would not replace it or do anything to make it right. My kid's and I have been going there for year's, we spend at least $150 on food every time we go there. I will never step foot in there again. What an awful way to treat a loyal customer.</text>

This is our favorite Chinese restaurant ever!  We live in Oklahoma but travel West for the summer.  Happy Gardens in Chester is what we look forward all
winter long.  We love Kevin and his wife!!!!  and the food is outstanding!
We have tried Chinese food from here to the West Coast and this is the best, bar none!!!   Can't wait for June!     We drive 70 miles one way  once we are in the Sierras for the summer - at least 2 or 3 times a month - to eat at Happy Gardens.<//text>

The meat is tender and the vegetables are FRESH!  The entrees are so flavorful without being over salty or overcooked.
Hands down, the best chow mein I have ever had....EVER.
For years I'd driven past this place thinking, "how good could Chinese food in Chester really be?", so I never went.  Boy oh boy was I missing out.    I am so glad I finally stopped in.  You will be too :)< /Text>

<username>jesse larson</username><Text>Saw all the good reviews on here and yelp so tried it not sure what all the hype is about!?!? Not impressed at all way over priced ordered egg rolls and they were cold spring rolls we also had the sweet n sour chicken which was swimming in sweet n sour sauce that we didn't car for. The vegetable fried was ok kinda skimpy on the vegetables. Pot stickers were average but also cold. Definitely not the best place to eat in this town at least I hope not I will try somewhere else next time< /Text><gmapID>0x809d96339c446c6f:0x2e264c7b998a5962<//gmapID><Time>1437790399199<//Time></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I recently purchased one of their products but was sent the wrong one. I tried contacting them by phone but it’s impossible to reach them, voicemail directs you to email them instead. I emailed them to inform them of their error and they emailed back within an hour, apologized for the error and took care of it immediately.<//Review><user_name>Betsygirl C.</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Absolutely horrible!!!!

DO NOT USE!!

They charged my card and sent me an invoice saying my payment has processed and my order is “trash”. When I tried to contact them to understand the mixup I discovered you cannot get ahold of them. A week later still no contact or refund. What the heck?!< /Text>< response>
{'time': 1594322288054, 'text': 'Hi Jon, credit cards are never charged unless your item ships.  the charge amount is placed on hold by authorize.net and you requested the order to be canceled. So once we cancel the hold is released so you will not see a charge or credit.'}</response>

< Review>
Fair prices, plenty of options but as of 03/13/20, and probably awhile before then, the phone number listed on Google and on their website is "Not currently in service", and aside from an automated message the day of my purchase, after trying both available emails, I've received no response from the company regarding my order, ETA, or any response at all.
Not sure if they are temporarily closed, out of business or what but if there is anyone working there they arent taking care of the online side of the business.</Review>

So its 5/16/2020 i order a 4 channel Rockford amp. 165.00 on the 13th of May. After reading other recent reviews going back to February i noticed a lot of ppl saying the same thing. Ordered  status says pending, no numbers to call (that work) and no response from customer service. I use USAA bank i called them told them everything. Come Monday if status hasn't changed to shipped the bank is stopping the transaction.  Banks can do this but they dont like to and most charge to do it. 100% scam</text>

I placed an order on Feb 13, 2019 for an amp at a great price. Even received a confirmation email about my order. But per the email still have not received a follow up email with my tracking/shipping details and have tried 4 different methods of contacting this business and no response from any of the information they have listed via email or phone. I feel very unsettled about how this is going, so I have reached out to the BBB and hopefully I can get a response that way. This is the first time anything like this has happened to me via an online purchase and I hope this review helps anyone else in my same situation, please read reviews about a place before even considering making a purchase. Valuable lessons learned...< /Text>

<Review>DON'T buy from this website.  SAME experience as others stated in previous reviews (sadly only checked AFTER no communication from Car Audio Giants).  I ordered some JL Audio speakers on Aug 1st, 2019.  Received a payment confirmation and order confirmation and my debit card was certainly charged.  Was promised shipping info within 24-48 hours and here it is Aug 13th and I have ZERO communication back from this company.  PHONE is disconnected and NO reply to 4 different emails.  This is not the way to conduct business for sure.  STAY AWAY.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcaccfc7126055:0xf148a80067f83443</Gmap_id>< Name>

I ordered a PAC interface on 6/3/19. The Car Audio Giants website confirmed that it was in stock and promised a tracking number within 24-48 hours. After that time period elapsed, I reached out via email and phone to get an update. Come to find out that the phone number listed on their site was not in service and the vendor was not responsive via email. After several day of waiting for tracking info, I requested that the order be canceled. I receive an email later that day stating that the order was canceled because it was back-ordered with no ETA then the initial charge was reversed.  A week later the package showed up on my doorstep and my credit card had been charged again. Being that I had already ordered, received, and installed the PAC interface via a different vendor, I no longer needed this one. I have sent countless emails to the vendor requesting an RMA and pre-paid return shipping label but haven't gotten a response. I have since filed a dispute with my Credit Card company and will be filing a complaint with the BBB.<//review>

Placed an order. Was supposed to be emailed within 48 hours about status. Never received an email. Tried to call and cancel but customer service phone number was "no longer receiving calls due to high call volume". I called again at least 20 times and received the same message. Sent 3 emails to support and still no response. I would not recommend this retailer.<//Text>

Yes, they have a lot of audio items at cheaper prices. No, they will not respond to your emails asking where your items are. No, you do not get current/updates info on your order, shipment wise, just a note that says "label created". No, they do not offer " fast shipping "< /text>

<review>I purchased a Pioneer AVIC-7201NEX 8/20/2018 and received an immediate auto reply confirming my order.  Also stated in this reply tracking information would be sent within 24-48 hours.  8/23/2018 I received no tracking information.  I called to inquire about my order.  Message stated due to high call volume, they were not accepting any calls and to try back later or email.  I emailed them 8/23/2018 12:38 PM with a copy of my invoice.  I finally received a reply 8/24/2018 5:22  PM stating the unit I purchased was on back order, no time frame given, just the options to wait or cancel.   I canceled my order, I do not care to wait indefinitely nor am I comfortable with the lack of customer service and the inability to contact them by phone.  It's understandable a product is not available, however, it should be reasonable to communicate this in a timely fashion.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

DO NOT BUY FROM THEM! Purchased a AV-Nex7200 from them. Got it fast and cheaply. 3 months later, the screen on the unit went bad. Got an RMA from them, sent it back, and it has been months with no info. They do not answer their phones, or emails. Do not purchase from them. Will be filling a complaint with the BBB.

Edit: Wound up randomly getting the head unit back from them fixed just recently.< /Text>

<Review>Called ahead because I wanted to make sure that they had the unit in stock and would ship in a timely manner to receive the unit by a certain day, was told they had a unit in stock, placed the order on the web site immediately after.   Next day, was wondering why I hadn't received the tracking information.   Called and found out then that the item was back ordered and wouldn't ship till the following week.   Don't know why I wasn't told that when I originally called.  Now it's too late to order elsewhere for my fathers day present.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I have now spent $60 in return shipping for two different speaker sets that ended up not fitting my doors.  I spent another $68 in restocking fees.  So $128 total in fees and shipping to send them back merchandise that is in new unused condition.

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Like others said not good people to work with. On the direct advice of their salesman ordered something that didn't fit my truck. Tried to return it and buy more expensive speakers (extra ($400) but it was just over 30 days and they would allow absolutely no exchange for partial credit or anything. And that is with speakers that had never been out of the box yet. My install guy looked at the box and knew it wouldn't fit so they were never even opened, Spend the extra $10 and deal with a company that values customers.</Review>< Pictures>

DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM CAR AUDIO GIANTS!!!

I ordered a new car stereo and what I received was a correct box, but an incorrect, used stereo inside.  CAG demanded a 35% restocking fee if I wanted to return it.  Once I FedEx'd it back, they denied they received it back.
Had to get Discover involved to get my money back.  (FedEx had copy of signature when returned)

READ THEIR FINE PRINT.  If you can find it on their web site.<//review>

Business not backing warranty of a $225 amplifier purchased by my sons hard earned internship money.  Unbeknownst to us that they sent a different model in 2015 upon purchase but now Car Audio Giants claims it was not sold by them.  Seriously,  this company is VERY dishonest & we learned that this business is NOT covered by BBB.  Will not make any future purchases from this company.< /review>

<text>BEWARE..terrible customer service. They shipped me a sony car stereo head unit missing the wiring harness and would do nothing to correct the problem.  The representative called me a liar and said I was making the story up.  Wouldn't let me return the item because it was missing a part, which made me laugh because yea obviously it's missing a part because that's how they sent it!  Car audio giants offered no resolution to this problem after I paid $199.00 for the stereo.  Yea, they have slightly cheaper equipment, but beware, they are a terrible business and will not help you if something is wrong.< /text><userid>116882156546829654062<//userid><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

<text>Hopefully this review will keep one or many from making the same mistake I did. I ordered nearly $1000.00 of JL Audio marine component speakers form Car Audio Giants. While opening, I noticed the factory seal on one box had been cut. One of the tweeters from that box had a major defect. I emailed pictures and asked if they would replace only the tweeter to save on shipping cost and help with a timely install. They responded “We can diffidently help you. Please send us the tweeter and we will defiantly exchange it for you”. Now when I call they give me the run around, refuse to give their names and ignore my emails. Also notice The Google street view of this business is an ABANDONED MINUTE MART and the only positive reviews sound more like an ad then a real review.DO NOT DEAL WITH THIS BUSINESS!!!!!!!!!!@!!</text></record>

Great customer service, fast and free shipping, and unbelievably awesome prices!

I recently purchased a pioneer touch screen stereo for my chrysler 300 and got an unbelievable deal on a great product.  The product was also backed up by a 3 year warranty!  I was also able to save lots of money by purchasing the installation components through car audio giants rather than buying them through a stereo installation company.  I saved lots of  money that I can now use when I'm in vegas this summer baby wooo!!< /text>

Bait and switch.  Advertised JL Subwoofer in stock and accepted my order and charged my card.  Get and email days later saying that it is not in stock and they will let me know when they get more in and if I would like to cancel my order I could.  I did and am now waiting my refund!</Review>

Horrible experience will never order from them again. I ordered a flip screen head unit and xm module said was in stock called to double check before i ordered. Ordered then came up as possible fraud charge.  Send everything to get that fixed then they tell me my order is canceled because what i ordered was on backorder.then after my order was canceled they charged my card twice for the same purchase that they had already canceled.<//Text>

This place is GARBAGE. Ordered an amp a week ago from them, and they still havent even gotten it to UPS. Not only that, but they will not return my voicemails/emails regarding the issue. Disgusting terrible service, will not be purchasing anything from them ever again</Text>

I ordered a amp that I was planning on installing the following weekend, the website said the item was in stock before placing my order. Two days later I get an email saying it is backordered and it may be a few days before it would ship. I then checked the website again and it still says it was in stock so I decided to go ahead and cancel the order and order the amp from Amazon for a few dollars more.</Text>

This park is amazing. There is lots of things to do here. There is Soccer fields, baseball fields, basketball courts, volleyball court, there’s a skate park, dog park, and three sets of play structures. There’s also public bathroom. There thing is new and clean.

It is also right next to the lake. So you can feed ducks. And also go fishing. We have done all these thing down there.

My daughter loves the y’all slide at the big park. But really like the rock wall at one of the smaller park.

We have feed the ducks a few times. And they will walk right up to you to get the food. We have also fished there. We have seen good sized catfish pulled out.

We love going down to this park. There is a little bit of anything for everyone to just have fun.< /text>

The beautiful new park was amazing 😍 Even though I believe that there should have been more activities for children 5 and under, the remodel was breath taking< /text>

Went to take pictures of sunset. Lovely views of the lake. The beach itself was clean and would be a good place to play. Above the beach you can see a lot going on, and a little less clean. The water was very clear and not a lot of green settled in this part of the lake. I would still keep a close eye on my surroundings while on a visit to this location.<//review>

Great little family area with a playground, charcoal grills, tables and beach.  Also there's a trail that leads to a peninsula where various areas good for fishing and also additional Rocky and Sandy Beach areas. Plus grassy area with trails I'm about an acre or so. And the bathroom is just across the street at Austin Park.<//review>

<time>1536536904154<//time><Review>Playground is situated between the lake and the street with no fence. Ok for bigger kids but if you have a little one that likes to take off running it's not safe at all. Large grass area w/picnic tables is nice, but you have to cross the street to get to the playground so not kid friendly no matter where you are.< /Review>< pictures>

This is a great spot. Almost don’t wanna write this because I love how it is not crowded. I have a picture of this beach from the 1950’s with folks from San Fran and other cities lounging on the beach!< /review>

< review>
Paid $80 for an oil change but whoever changed my oil didn’t put my skid plate on correctly. Four of my bolts were missing in the front and my skid plate hung down in the front and scraped on the road. How do 4 bolts just magically disappear?? Went out of town so someone else had to fix it. Emailed corporate and he told me to take it to a different oil changers to get it fixed. Called the manager at the Sonoma location and he couldn’t give me a straight answer on how my bolts went missing.  Wont go back there and definitely not worth $80 for all the trouble.
Edit: contacted them will my license plate with the email they gave me and never heard a response back. Very disappointing especially for the price point< /review>

Fast, transparent, polite, reasonable price.

I drove into Sonoma, CA and my oil change light came on!!! Like always I freaked out that I couldn’t find a Jiffy Lube!!!

However I called up Oil Changers, gave me no hassle. Made some recommendations, changed my oil and flushed my transmission fluid and had me in and out.

Jake and Payton both paid me special attention and Phil was a sweet heart. I’m so thankful that there are still gentle and kind men in the world ♥️<//text>

Pretty good, they seem alright but if you do go I would recommend checking your drivers manual to see what needs to be done and ask them what they will do with your vehicle, always ask them just incase. Before they had people that didn't really pay attention and would cause big mistakes, thats why I originally stopped going. But they seem to be paying attention more now.<//review>

Christian took a look at my car’s fluid levels, and let me know that everything looked clean and full, and that the service was not needed at this time.

Avoid this place at all cost. Especially on a Saturday morning there’s a young girl and a young guy there either they have no interest in changing oil early in the morning or they  have no idea about simple oil changes, they’ll tell you everything in the book why they can’t change your oil. But they did have time for social hour between the two of them in the back of the building that I noticed as  I checked my car in at  Sonoma tire, lube and oil across the street.  Save time go across the street to Sonoma tires excellent service professional people that know how to actually do an oil change.  Very reasonable price.</review>

They tried to upsell me to a $300+ price for oil change, air filter, engine oil cleaning and transmission flush and seemed to not like it when I declined. They upsold me to an engine oil cleaning for $18 which was probably unnecessary and possibly even dangerous. Won't be going back.<//review>

<review>The two gentlemen that helped me were very professional and courteous. They had me in and out in a very timely manner. They topped off my windshield washer fluid, which I’ve had other places neglect to do. They filled my tires and performed a light inspection. I felt confident getting back on the road after visiting. The one serviceman even knew the code to erase my trucks “change oil” message, from memory. I will definitely go back and would recommend to others.<//review>< username>

<Text>I took my infrequently driven jeep in after more than a year. The excellent employee checked my car’s record and told me that he wanted me to get my full 3,000 miles worth from my last oil change and to come back after doing another 1,000 miles. He then checked the oil, just to be sure, checked the pressure on all the tires and sent me on my way. No charge!< /Text>< Resp>

<review>It was my bad, car started showing up an alert all of a sudden, and it happened so, I was lucky to be nearby Oil Changers' place at the moment. It was just 2 minutes before they close but anyway they checked my Prius and discovered I had run out of oil almost completely. I am so super grateful, it was kind of, the nicest thing that people did to me in quite a while. THANK YOU GUYS!

I extremely recommend this place.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1526338084718, 'text': "Thank You Max Loginov For your Amazing Review!

In the past the employees here only tried to upsell you everything they could and it didnt seem like they really knew what they were talking about. After having a few bad experiences here I told myself i would never come back however i was already 1000 miles late for my oil change and had no time to schedule an appointment with my mechanic so i decided i had no choice but to get it done here. When i pulled up i told the guy right off the back , i dont want synthetic oil or any upgrades just a standard oil change. The first thing the employee (John)said was, your car doesnt need synthetic so i wouldnt offer you that anyways. John explained why my car didnt need synthetic and he explained what services were available if i wanted the best for my high mileage car. He didnt push anything on me and since he explained everything thoroughly along with the benefits i decided to add a few other services. John is definitely a car guy and because of this experience i will continue coming back here and i will recommend them to friends and family.< /text>

Spoke with Phil, greeted by a very nice young gal. Phil was very honest, hardworking, and spoke about my car with me, oil, among other things. Will be coming for an oil change soon.<//Review>

<review>This is the first review I have ever written on the internet. I would give 0 stars if I could. Waited in line for 15 minutes and then was asked to move my car so that the woman next to me who arrived AT EXACTLY THE SAME TIME could receive service first. The man was rude and it was unprofessional. I've been going here for years but will never go back.< /review><rating>1<//rating><GmapID>0x8085ac3b78a9d04d:0x97ea8fe67b5658cd<//GmapID>< pics>

(Translated by Google) The attention in this place is very good. Changing the oil not only of the engine but of the transmission is fast. It is always my option to do it.

< Review>
I've been a dedicated customer to this location for well over 5 years. The service here is incredible!!!
They always go way beyond to help. My most recent was with a girl there named "Fanny". I was having a very difficult time with my phone service and getting upgraded. But she displayed the kind of customer service that is very hard to find and that's why even though I live 20 minutes away from this location and there are many other stores in between I will ALWAYS come here.
Thank you....<//Review>

After a somewhat disappointing experience at another Metro location, I was delighted to meet Liz at the 1667 W. Carson store! She took time to understand my problem and work out a creative solution. With my "old school" mentality, I did not make it easy for her but she persevered in a most pleasant manner. Thank you, Liz!</Text>

< Review>
The ABSOLUTE WORST customer service I have EVER experienced!!!!!!
This store only had ONE EMPLOYEE working PERIOD, with customers CONSTANTLY coming in to pay their monthly bills----which meant having my phone purchase attempt INTERRUPTED OVER 20 TIMES by 20 DIFFERENT CUSTOMERS paying their phone bills, in this AWFUL place with TRASH on the floor and 5 DIFFERENT INCIDENCES of customers being ALLOWED TO ENTER AND LINGER INSIDE OF THE STORE WITH Covid-19 pandemic masks MERELY COVERING THEIR MOUTHS AND THEIR NOSTRILS FULLY EXPOSED TO THE OPEN AIR!!!!

In HARANGUING 3-HOUR NIGHTMARE of an attempted phone replacement, Fanny (the RUDEST, most CRASS and DISRESPECTFUL retail representative I have EVER encountered in my ENTIRE life) sold me a phone WITHOUT FIRST disclosing MATERIAL FACTS about the phone (including the color of the phone she was HURRIEDLY trying to force me to buy). She hurriedly showed me the black front of a phone STILL in a box covered in plastic, then (IN BETWEEN TAKING PHONE PAYMENTS FROM MULTIPLE CUSTOMERS) DISCONNECTED MY FORMER PHONE SERVICE from my old black and silver LG phone, activated the “new phone” and then handed me this UGLY GHETTO-LOOKING LOUD COLOR BLUE phone (the color of which I WAS NEVER APPRISED OF BEFORE THE PHONE SERVICE TRANSFER) and then DEMANDED THAT I ACCEPT THE UGLY BLUE PHONE or have my Metro service (that I have had with Metro PCS WITH THE SAME PHONE NUMBER FOR THE LAST 10 YEARS) “disconnected and discontinued completely”.

When I REFUSED to accept possession of the blue ghetto phone and instead telephoned Metro PCS Corporate Customer Service about this UNFATHOMABLY UNPROFESSIONAL, DISHONEST and DISRESPECTFUL BAIT-AND-SWITCH SCAM, Fanny then attempted to EXTORT a $21.00 “transfer fee” from me to have my service reconnected to my old phone.

Fanny was SO RUDE and SO UNPROFESSIONAL to the Metro PCS Corporate Customer Service representative when he asked to speak to her over the phone, that he ultimately hung up on her. In the process of  doing so, Fanny also DICTATORALLY announced that I would “not be allowed” to utilize the Metro PCS phone upgrade discount that I was eligible for ($90) that she applied toward the purchase price of the ugly blue phone ON ANY OTHER Metro PHONE PURCHASE, UNTIL 6 MONTHS FROM NOW!!!!!

It should also be noted that this retail business franchise is in DIRECT VIOLATION of California State law, in that there is NO California State Business License (detailing who owns this scam artist dump of a phone store) ANYWHERE ON THE PREMISIS. When I inquired about the license, Fanny informed me that it was “posted next door” at the Boost phone store, since “the same person owns both stores”. When my church member and I went next door and inquired about the license posting, a VERY RUDE man pointed to a business license posted on a wall SEVERAL FEET behind the phone display counter, that was therefore COMPLETELY illegible to customers!!!!

These people ARE THE ABSOLUTE WORST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Review>

I love coming to this location. The place is always clean and the workers always have a great attitude. My favorite is Liz! She has great customer service skills and always helps me in a caring, efficient, and professional manner. She made sure I got the right plan for my family and I at an affordable price. Also showed me new gear for my phone that I absolutely love. Plus, this place is always open! Keep up the good work ladies!</Text>

The attendant's sister walked into the store twice without a face mask. I told the attendant  shouldn't everyone be expected to enter the business with a face mask.  Her answer was, she's my sister.  So attendant 's family members are exempt from wearing a mask? Is it okay for attendant's family members to spread their germs?</Review>

Excellent experience/service! Walked in not knowing much about smartphones, and provider promotions, but the ladies at the front desk were absolutely great! Made the entire process quick and easy! They were also helpful and informative. Rey in the next shop provided some expertise and made the entire process effortless/simple. Will and would recommend this place to everybody. Rey, Fanny, and Blanca are the best!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I went to this place because the other metro by the normandie did not give me all my data, and elizabeth helped me rescue all my mail. Clean and good customer service if I could give 10 stars

<Review>I only get 1/2 hr lunch break at work, so I order online for a quick pick up. Has never failed! It's always been ready, I don't even spend 30 secs in there. Would get five stars from me if you could get more options online. I understand they are trying to keep it simple in order to be quick, but I need my cilantro dude! I they do not offer it online!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I was looking forward to eating a good sandwich.. but when someone walked in to pick up and order, an employee stopped making the sandwich they were working on and went to open the door to ask what name it was, she went to get his bag and then went back and opened the door to give him his food then returned to continue working on sandwich with the SAME GLOVES she opened and filthy door with... with this pandemic going on I wouldn't eat there because of the carelessness of the employee to cross contamination!<//text>

<Text>Just got back from Subway and had a potential bad experience turned into a 5 star experience because of the quality service that was given to me by the man in charge.
As I entered this establishment, only one other person was in line ordering and one person on the serving side taking this customer's order. The only other employ that I believed was there 2as stocking chips right next to me. The gentleman behind the counter asked the young lady stocking chips to come back and help out. It was at this point I realized she was a new hire.probably her first day. I am the first to understand how nervous a person can get on their first of a new job, especially if it could be your first ever job. As I told her what my order was and watched her make my order, I realized she might have tunnel vision right now. Not only did she not hear what I had asked, she only put enough meat for a 6" sub let alone a foot long. I Kinsley informed her that there wasn't enough meat on the sandwich and it just wasn't registering with her. So, as I was checking out, in my frustration of trying to be as nice as possible, informed the gentleman in charge that my order is on the slim side. He promptly made a new one and handled with the greatest of professionalism. I am impressed as it is hard to find these days. As far as the young lady that was starting her new job, she will be just fine when she gets the groove of things and has an awesome instructor to guide her into being a confident employee.

<Text>My trash person must be the best because they have never missed a pick up in 3 years, I personally think it’s a little on the expensive side but that might be because there is only 2 of us.

Employee confronted photographers on a public sidewalk, demanded ID, claimed the sidewalk is their property, then "cambacked" in an aggressive manner.  Looked really silly for a grown man to act that way.</Text>

Timing is crucial, if you wait till noon to drop off your load you will wait in a long line. The employees really work hard to organize the traffic and make the service move as efficiently as possible. They definitely need one more weigh scales to make exiting more efficient. The cashier was friendly and fast to get the lines moving. I will keep this place in mind the next time I have to drop off large amounts of trash.< /text>

I have been paying to use the truck services in the school around lake Arowhead for years and never was asked to show proof of payment. Last weekend, and without  any notice I was not allowed to dispose of my trash because I did not have my payment receipt, which is in my permanent address 90 miles from here.< /Text>

I called to report that 2 of our trash cans have wear & tear damages and need to be replaced. Spoke with a lady at C/ S today, Wednesday,  10/16/19 around 11:30 am. I did not get her name but I would like to give her a big shoutout.  She was able to resolve my problem. She was professional and  very courteous.</review>

<Review>It's hard to understand when I tried to cancel the trash deliver services as I was moving out of CA, the lady Maria didn't let me to cancel the services unless if I had to show her my new house documents at other states. It's ridiculous as I have no freedom to choose if I need their services or not!  She threatened me: "You must pay trash delivery fee no matter you have trash or not! ". Oh, really? How rude and bossy talks! Is this low that You made?? And who are you??
Very rude customer service behavior!< /Review>< date>

WORST COMPANY!  AVOID!!
i ORDERED A DUMPSTER FOR YARD WORK TELLING THEM WHAT WAS GOING IN IT.  THEY DELIVERED A DAY LATE COSTING ME EQUIPMENT RENTAL FEE (THAT WAS NEEDED TO LOAD DUMPSTER), DIDN'T CALL OR NOTIFY ME, DELIVERED WITH MATERIAL ALREADY IN IT, BILLED ME FOR OVERWEIGHT FEES (NOT CONTESTING), CLAIMED THERE WAS MATERIAL IN IT OTHER THAN WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN (AN EXCUSE TO CHANGE THE TYPE OF RENTAL AND CHARGE MORE), WON'T RETURN CALLS OR HAVE A MANAGER CALL BACK, AND AREN'T CREDITING THE ADDITIONAL COST I HAD TO INCUR BECAUSE OF THEM NOT DELIVERING OR CALLING.  I'VE CONTACTED THE BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU ABOUT THIS COMPANY.  COMPANIES THAT OPERATE LIKE THIS SHOULD BE PUT OUT OF BUSINESS!< /Text>

I just spent an hour and a half waiting to get into the place someone please help I lost a whole hour of my life I can't get back. 9/11/2018

Good very good place. Which it seems everyone else thinks so.....

It's such a good place that I have gone 3 days in a row. Spending a whole hour each time just sitting in line waiting to get inside and dump my load. (Lol)

Someone please tell them they got to do some major expansion of the driveway because this whole business of sitting in line for an hour or more really sucks.

My productivity is Hindered thank you tho<//Review>

Went in for green waste, cost us only 40 dollars for a truck load. Me and my husband were having some trouble unloading the truck and were getting late( closing time of the place) One of their worker came and helped us with unloading. Very satisfied with service.< /Review>

<review>Looking for disposal for your construction project? Avoid at all costs! 4 different times they were sopposed to deliver a dumpster and they flaked each time. Gonzalez the route supervisor neglected his duties to deliver a dumpster today on our palisade property.
This is not a professional outfit. They were happy to take our money. They failed on every level of a professional organization. I found for 3/4ths the cost another firm willing to handle our needs. Avoid at all costs!</review>< pics>

This is a transfer station pretty much a modern-day dump Aston of going to Ripley to the landfill and throwing your trash out you go here I can't say anything good or bad about it it is a necessary evil for people that are doing major Construction Products they have green waste recycling on one side of the yard and trash on the other side of the yard</review>

(Translated by Google) It's okay we need to disengage ourselves from what we don't need ... but it takes a long time to weigh a lot on the line ok aber if they grab something about it thanks

(Translated by Google) I just went to throw trash from my house and after I was two hours on the line waiting for my shift they ask me for a $ 120 deposit when I think that I do not bring the minimum of trash what is $ 30 and nothing else brought $ 100 and then I did not they let me throw the garbage I think it's not fair that they should have a little more consideration in these cases is my opinion

Acabo de ir a tirar basura de mi casa y después de que estuve dos horas en la línea  esperando mi turno me piden $120 de depósito cuando yo pienso que no traigo ni el mínimo de basura  qué son $30  y nada más traía $100 y pues No me dejaron tirar la basura Yo pienso que no es justo que deberían de tener un poco más de consideración en estos casos es mi opinión< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>It's more like a thrift bin with hangers instead of bins, lots of clothing to go thru. Prices were pretty reasonable.  The pants, jeans, skirts ,dresses shirts, blouses and shoes were priced around $1.91 to about $4.00. 2 pcs oufits were priced  up to $9.99.   Note , this place is CASH ONLY and bags are 11 cents per bag.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNqrTqX01bO5lCJUZL94u7TSz5c_HV-UveDF4sK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJpPrYxWXlEoy7AWNIOBRpjTi1c4wXFG-hvapq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOI7MBiAKw0CV6EvGOEsKgiSCijkyY2OaU02q59=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmFYNOGHfEJTu_OBc5J7PH_K9FYXpWjBoSEmd5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCd3rqcTfmafsQH8SmMnCzDFBLefINY7Hugs3Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsvtHZOdRu2dDRH9hBiGXKvYpsSqWsER087__4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPa2Gc2iaQopsn_hQglA2ZHAYYQ0iGgCAPNO-mx=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2PcYBGJ-VI8JltWcS0CJnipzpXmQ4rkynfltq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMkROxnAiDzyXP0mz9VkV1KEy1vr3S9kP4AUDQQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO06-awDaXd17FD0BBb2izhQJy5QgEcZN8CTIah=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOKx6qVz9WWwLAnYhO2eo5A-XJg6MO1sr5azGN7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaK9swkzba-id2ADUXbJ6YhlI23BNpkPQVIrPb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP5BP7LvDBPCRYvo2gdbO3lKyvTb1SWech-okZY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTTc20iCCbo7bkBwINK2TKiqTL15yn-jMXwQf8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnjJZP6ucOPMOUibWtNMqrryEUFa8U1G1pID7z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfIZoGUrANFEJUf2Y6xqtv2q20iqVpWztTRfeg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOu0jLwY_syqNy9wBRDyqo8Vl_LUVK1_O1TlaQs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjlVruv9eMc-ZbyoWSDzHnPqgxNQoFR18HL6mV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80dd3331f2c5208d:0xae629756f0f75b6a</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>The thing I don't like from this place is that there's no ventilation or air inside. Or how full or "tight" you can't even slide the hangers to see the clothes and you pull the hanger out to look to see if it is what you want it's too tight and the clothes falls🙄😤< /review>< response>

Great prices on clothes. They only accept cash which is good on their part when it comes to the owner's His/Her taxes. They can always just guess an amount at the end of the year and give it to the IRS. Besides that mostly all Staff are friendly but there is just one rude one there. Been shopping here for 10 years and i just started seeing this lady about 3 years or 4. She is very rude. I dnt know her name but she is a Latina about 5ft even and super chubby. She goes around acting like if she owns the place. I usually spent about $50. But when I see her I just spent 5 or 6  bucks and leave.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I've been coming here since I was a kid. I can't seem to step foot in any other Thrift store, this one's my favorite! 🙄 I have found many vintage pieces of clothing here and BRAND NEW good quality shoes. The kids clothing section never fails me, I always find something for my daughter... pants,dresses, pajamas,heavy duty coats. The prices are good and even much more worth it when they have selected tags 50% off 👌 but you have to be there as soon as they open. This place gets busy even on days when there aren't any price specials.</review>< pics>

I walked a good mile since I don't own a car to this place with my daughter in her stroller. I was in the thrift store for less than 2 minutes when this lady walked toward me, said that I can't be here with the stroller and insinuating that I might steal something from the store. Like if I'm going to steal junk.< /text>

<Review>My wife likes to see what kind of vintage items she can find at thrift stores, and had been wanting to see what was here. They were closing the store down early apparently and while she was busy putting our son in the cart and didn’t notice an employee (Gisela if they gave her real name) was saying they were closing. She then yelled they were closing and to “get in line or get out!” Very unprofessional and she even walked off muttering her anger to other workers. My wife confronted her on her rude behavior and got more attitude. It seems like this is common from other reviews. Very sad and disappointing to behave that way with someone who really wanted to see what she could buy there.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>It's okay, they have a lot of clothes for everyone, purses and a few other things. They sell mostly clothes and have 50% off on selected items every 2 weeks for 3 days starting Thursday. They don't give bags because its Long Beach so if you decide to try it remember...take your own bag!<//Review>< Pictures>

A restroom there. Also another time I went I was trying on a skirt I took off my  skirt and of course I had shorts under the were pretty long and one of the  employees got mad at me. I was like what it's not my fault that they don't have a fitting room. Plus the store is really really dirty< /review>< Pics>

Very good place to thirft shop affordable prices huge selection on clothes and other things..... But a lot ot the Customer that shop there are leaving a lot of mess behind after they look thru the clothing then complain when the employees ask them not to leave stuff on the floor or on top of the racks ...... I feel Sorry for the employees that have to have clean up over and over because people don't care other wise 5 tumbs up.< /text>

Been coming here for years Not nearly as much jewelry or nicknacks as in the past, but then again I did find some classic like new LL Bean sandals and a very old large Birdse maple box with lock-out - not perfect, so the price was very reasonable ❤<//Text>

I haven't been yet but they close at 4:45pm. We got there 4:55pm and a lady was closing the parking lot.
Hours 10 am to 4:45pm. When we make it I will state my experience.<//Review>

My wife and I had a pleasant experience. Laurie is a true professional and gave us a no pressure experience. We test drove a Mazda CX5. It was a very nice quiet cabin with smooth acceleration. We are considering this over the Honda CRV. There is only one point that Mazda has against it, lack of interior space. I  still enjoyed the drive and the low pressure experience at Neftin Mazda. I will consider returning there for our purchase if we decide on the Mazda.<//Text>

<review>Was looking for a specific MX 5 club soul red.  Neftin  received the car I was looking for in a dealer trade.  I had received a quote from another dealer on the exact car. Brought the wife over to look at the car, she approved.  Salesman Tim helped us and was extremely nice and helpful. We worked on the deal.  We went home to sleep on it, no pressure from Tim what so ever.  Went back the next day and made the purchase.  Thanks again Tim and the rest of the folks over at Neftin.<//review>< Rating>

This is the third CX-5 in a row that my wife and I have leased from Neftin Mazda--and for good reasons. Our latest experience with this dealership continues a pattern of delightful experiences. Danny Schaefer, the Sales Manager, put numbers together (without the need to negotiate and without pressure) that made it possible to get a better equipped CX-5 below the amount we expected to pay: 2021 CX-5 Grand Touring AWD Deep Crystal Blue with the Premium Package and with black leather. As to the CX-5, there've been enough subtle improvements to the point where we again got far more than we expected in the new vehicle. We highly recommend this dealership, Richard Diaz the sales consultant, and Danny Schaefer. They made the process super-easy, quick, and delightful.< /Review>

<text>This is a difficult review to write, my experience with Neftin started out really strong and then cratered. I want to cover the good point first. Cynthia was an excellent salesperson, she answered tons of questions, found the car I wanted, and did her best with a situation that quickly started spiraling down.

Onto the bad. The car I got was part of a dealer trade, and had to be driven up to Neftin. The first inspection of the car as a once over was fine, but prior to purchasing we went over it in more depth. There as large chip on the door edge (down to the metal) near the driver side door handle, a large scratch on the gas cap, and two chips on the front bumper.  On pointing them out I was assured they could be fixed.  I should have backed out then, but after the work Cynthia had put in to find and get the car I decided to move forward.  Paperwork was fine, signed on the dotted line. Took it home for a few days before bringing it back for the paint repairs. It went downhill from there.  This was 3/25.

The first repair was delayed due to an internal error, I was offered a free Xpel clear bra and door trim due to the error.  It was also offered as it was a chip repair, not a full paint. After a few days I got the car back and the chip repair was terrible. It was explained to me that the chip needed to cure and then be brought back to be leveled/smoothed out.  The bumper had no work done, the gas cap was fixed. They also would not hold the car at the time as they didn't have garage space.  While this did not make a ton of sense to me, I took the car home.  During this time I also worked with the dealership and the wrapping service to add some additional Xpel layers on my dime, this included putting down my own deposit.  We got the car back 4/2.

Because the Xpel layer was coming, I didn't want to risk any further paint damage, plus the chip on the door made me nervous, so the car stayed in a garage.  Took it back on the 6th.

I went to pick up the car on the 9th and it looked worse than when it went in. The chip was still there, but now it has bubbled edges. The bumper was not repaired at all, and even had an orange spot now. The Xpel was intended to cover these flaws up. I refused to take the car in that shape. The manager came out, agreed the work was shoddy and they kept the car to decide on the best method of repair. It was decided on Monday that the car would go for a full repaint on the door and bumper.  During that conversation it was relayed to me that the dealership would no longer cover their portion of the Xpel coverage. So I've not had my car a long period of time, a service that was offered as compensation for a delay has been removed, and I've already put a deposit down on additional services that I have to cover more costs to complete.

I spoke with the wrap team and they won't be able to do any work on the car for three weeks to ensure the paint is fully set.

I finally get the car back on the 16th.   For those keeping track that's three weeks it's been in and out of the shop.

As of now my car is still sitting in a garage because I don't want to risk any additional paint damage before the clear coat.  None of these delays would have been needed if the dealership had been honest about what the repairs would take, and fixed it properly the first round.   They could have reduced the sales price of the car initially as well, or found another one. I was a guaranteed sale, but did have to have the car right now.  This was my first new car in ten years, and this was an extremely sour experience, it sucked all the joy out of getting a new car.

We will never return to this dealership. I would recommend if your car is coming from another dealership as part of a trade make sure to go over it in detail, and do not accept it if there are any issues with a promise of a fix.

Cynthia Votava - the standard by which all others should be judged in the new car business. Got us the exact car in the color and configuration we wanted (2021 Mazda 3 Turbo) - no haggle numbers, great delivery and personalized service.  Maybe that's why we have been getting cars from the Neftin team since 1988</review>

We bought a new car on Wed evening from a different Mazda dealer and on Friday afternoon, we noticed the AC wasn’t working. We stopped in here to Netfin because they appeared still open and on our way. Joe and Freddy here, kindly took us as walk-ins and helped diagnose a potential leak, filled up the refridgerment, and charged it all up. He gave us good follow up guidance. Really happy we pulled over and took a chance. Beyond generous with their time and help for a late Friday afternoon. Probably worth coming back here even if it may be out of our way.<//Text>

<Review>This review is for the service department. I have been coming here for last one year and have nothing but good things to say about the experience. All  service managers here are very welcoming professionals, but I want to highlight Alex Crostic, who has been my service manager for most of the times, his professionalism and courtesy makes me feel that my car is in safe hands.
Every car dealership advertises to customers that we are their extended family, but it is professionals like Alex that actually make this materialize.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>My background: I'm a mechanical engineer. This is by far the worst car-buying experience I've ever had. Come to Neftin Westlake for the authentic 3rd rate New Jersey used car lot experience.

Since purchasing a vehicle here, I've had (within 5,000 miles of purchase):
-Suspension issues (I suspect a worn bushing, started hearing it clunk around almost immediately)
-Transmission issues (sticks in gear, again within a month of purchase)
-To remove wax from my plastic trim and headlights, and re-polish the paint since it was clearly hit with a dirty buffing wheel. I believe this was a gift from their "touch up" while I was signing paperwork.
-Have the hood latch adjusted so I could actually close it (The sales manager insisted he had done his due diligence on the vehicle immediately after this fix. Hilarious after driving down the interstate with a loose hood on a 1 month old "Certified" vehicle.)
-Have a suspicious dent in the hood from someone clearly trying to force it closed due to the maladjusted latch (I believe this was also a gift from their "touch up" while I was signing paperwork).

I'm kind of wondering what the Culver City dealership will find when they flush the transmission. I half expect sawdust at this point.

If this is what they sign off on for CPO, steer EXTREMELY clear.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1580335700099, 'text': 'Steve, Our goal is to make sure each certified car is in excellent condition.

<Review>Second time here and very happy both times. Alex helped me in service and he was fantastic with my 16 Nd miata. The receptionist guy is a little rude and unprofessional, but everyone else is fantastic so it doesn’t bother me. Thanks guys for your continued great service. I’m very picky about who I let near my Car. Thanks for being a team I can trust. Also they wash cars while in service, not a lot of dealerships do that. It’s actually a pretty big deal.</Review>< pictures>

I lost power steering, etc. This dealership even though I had never purchased anything from them. Offered to repair what they could. Alex is the representative I was working with and I highly recommend him. He is patient understanding and sympathetic. Neftin Westlake is my trusted dealership from now on.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I just bought my third car from this place (From their used car lot). And in return they showed me that they valued my business by bending over backwards to help me get into a car! They gave me a great deal and better financing than my credit union was offering. Jan worked and pushed the financing through for me. He might be my hero! Dui was my sales person and was helpful but low pressure. The whole experience was as good as it gets. I'll come back again.</Review>

<review>Terrible customer service by Sales Manager Cynthia Votava.  She was very put out by having to fill out two lines on a document verifying mileage for a lease turn in and let me know that.  She was angered by my 5 minutes of time with her and said she had to drop everything to help me and tell me how I needed an appointment because she is so busy.  This is on Christmas Eve with not a single customer in the dealership and her just sitting at her desk and 5 other employees doing the same thing.  One star is too many!  She earned a 0.</review>< rating>

Best Dealership EVER!  I adore everyone and have for over 20 years.  Danny Shaffer is the best!  I have bought many a car for myself and my family/friends . I will never go to another dealership.  I had a problem with my car years ago in Neveda and the dealership was so rude.  This was something I was not used to at Neftin. Danny made a quick call  and all of a sudden I was treated like royalty.  Had Danny not called, it would have taken me days to have my car serviced.  Funny how in 15 minutes due to Danny, my cars AIR was serviced and my kids were back in an air conditioned car when Vegas was 118 degrees.   Today an issue with my car and he moved heaven and earth for me again.</review>

<review>Kim and I are thrilled with her new CX-5! We chose a 2018 Grand Touring with Deep Crystal Blue Mica/Parchment color combination. Love the color and notice many improvements over the 2016. With the low money factor, high residual and incentives the 2018 rather than the 2019 was the way to go. In fact, our payment dropped $40/month and term dropped from 36 to 30 months--and we got a MUCH better equipped vehicle!!

Matt Heller, the Mazda brand genius, did an exceptional job explaining the operation of the vehicle. We both agreed that this was by far the best delivery explanation we’ve ever experienced in decades of buying and leasing many, many (too many) vehicles. And, I was going to skip the explanation but there were so many improvements that I was not aware of that we would may have missed enjoying some of its features or spent a lot more time trying to find operating instructions in the very thick owner's manual.

We also appreciated that John Swanson moved us through the paperwork quickly so we could get home for another round with our Thanksgiving leftovers.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I came here for after-market parts for my car..they were offering a significantly better deal than the dealer from where I purchased it.

In terms of customer service, Neftin has been great, both via telephone when I discussed my parts requests, and in person when I had them installed. Pricing was clear and Joe, in service gave me 20% not just for the parts, but also labor.

All told, within just over two hours I was out the door,  including a car wash :)< /review>

Just purchased my second car from Neftin Mazda last Thursday.  First one was over 5 yrs ago and traded in for a new Mazda3 5 door and love this new one even more than my old one.  The first one I purchased was the most pain free car buying experience ever and this one was too.  Have used the service dept also with my old 3 and never had any issues with scheduling, the work done etc.  Cynthia in sales and Joe in service are both great!  My friend also bought a used car on Thursday from Cynthia and he also had a great experience on his first car purchase.</review>

< Review>
We bought a Mazda 3 for our son from the Neftin dealership in Thousand Oaks last Sunday.  We have visited the dealership a couple of times in the last few months looking for a car with good gas mileage.  There was never any pressure from any salesperson.  They were always helpful and allowed us to test drive a number of cars and patiently answered all questions my son had.   Finally, when we decided to go with the Mazda (great gas mileage and fun to drive)  we walked into Neftin Mazda.  John Weeks knew a lot about the Mazdas and helped us pick one up from the lot with just the right upgrades we liked.  The sale went through smoothly with no pressure whatsoever to buy any extras.  None of that buy the extra warranty or else kind of talk.  They just mentioned that we could buy it if we wanted it.  That is it and we got a great price on the new car.  This is the most friendly dealership we have ever been to and the most positive experience in buying a car.</Review>

We had a very poor sales experience yesterday with Neftin Mazda, specifically with a salesperson named Brandon. He was unprofessional, uninformed and just plain rude. He knew almost nothing about the car we were interested in and kept repeating, "We haven't been trained, yet" whenever we asked a question. While I understand that it's possible he may not have been trained, he seemed genuinely annoyed when we kept asking even basic questions about the vehicle. For example, when we asked why the sticker price didn't seem to make sense, he said something like, "Aw, they just stick those on there." Really? When we asked to see a specific model, he stomped out of the showroom ahead of us toward the lot as if we had interrupted his otherwise quiet car-selling Sunday. I asked him if he had a problem and he said, "Hey, I'm showing you the car, aren't I?" Really? We said, no thanks and walked off the lot. He stormed away. Solid customer service. Neftin used to be a quality dealer. What happened?</Review>

<review>Sales person was wonderful. I knew which vehicle I wanted and he helped us to find the correct one.
For once I did not feel as if I was "tied" to the dealership. It was an easy purchase for me. Neftin is lucky to have a sales person such as John!

Bought a 2016 Mazda 5 from Erik Venegas.  He was great to work with, very knowledgeable, patient, and we really appreciated his no pressure approach. We went in late on a weeknight when they happened to be closing up the dealership.  Erik stayed and let us take a car out for a test drive.  After looking around for a few days, we went back and bought the car.  The entire process was faster than it took to get a price from other dealerships, no drama or stress. I would recommend this dealership and Erik for a hassle free buying experience.</Text>

Well, Mazda just rolled out the upgrade and I was super excited! I called the dealership and spoke to the sales manager, Ernest Eagan, and he refused to honor their promise, and wanted to charge me $450+ for the installation.

This is the first new car I have ever bought and one of the biggest purchases in my life so far and I took a week to make sure I was doing the right thing. It started out nicely and then they didn't have the car I wanted which is fine but then I found the one I wanted at South Bay Mazda. Vince did not seem willing to work out a deal with the other dealer telling me it was no longer in stock and seemed to get annoyed with me. Couple days before I said my next available day was Monday after work and he said "Really? Monday again?". That was it for me, went down to South Bay Mazda and had everything ready to go when I got there and I was out within an hour and they were great. Shame really, I sent my friend all the way to South Bay Mazda and he bought a car tonight.<//review>

Two things really stuck out in this purchase experience. One was that the dealership and staff are very together, and two, Vokswagen makes an exception vehicle for the money.  I am 51 years old, and have purchased many cars. This was my best car buying experience ever. I will go back to Neftin, and I will continue to buy Volkswagen vehicles.  In my mind, there is no better combination.<//Text>

Neftin once again exceeded expectations of customer service.  The Neftin staff is a top notch collection of people who actually care about giving you a positive experience whether you buy a vehicle or not.  They have an overwhelming amount of knowledge of not only their vehicles but of those of their competitors and always tell the truth when asked to compare.  Mazda is a great product that basically sells itself due to the quality of the machines they put on the road.  Dave was my salesman and was quite possibly the nicest person I have even met. He was straight to the point about everything and gave me an honest comparison of the CRV vs the CX-5, pointing out the strengths of both vehicles and allowing me to make a choice.  This is unlike the Honda dealership I went to (name left untold) where they basically bashed on Mazda and made it seem like their car was by far the best on the market and that the competition sells inferior merchandise.
I did my research and found that I was getting the lowest price possible at Neftin while other dealerships were quoting me prices that were thousands of dollars more.  Neftin Mazda cares about their customers and wants you to feel good about what you drive.   If you are looking to buy a Mazda, make the drive to Thousand Oaks and go to Neftin Madza..... ask for Dave.  (And don't forget to get your free jelly beans)<//text>

Go anywhere else but here for service...
Although the service dept staff wass friendly (i figure they have to be because they are ripping you off so why not do it with a smile)
I get a call from Mazda about a airbag recall so i take it in for the recall... my car works and runs just fine taking it in... thay talk me into an oil change, of which i needed so ok... i pick up the car... it is not running as normal or how it did when i dropped it off then shortly after i get home my check engine light goes on.
I bring it back and $400 later i get my car back... i cant help but feel scammed... "coincidence" maybe... but my car was absolutely fine when i first brought it in and am told it was a coil or something of which it is not something i can look into myself... so why not take me for the fool.
Good work Neftin... my wife and I will never purchase again from you. BUYER BEWARE</Review>

Bob was an amazing sales person to deal with at VW. He kept me apprise of everything that was going on with financing. He went the extra mile and followed me home with my car so that I could drive my new VW home that evening. I would definitely send my friends to VW and have them ask for Bob.<//text>

This is the worst place to deal with they are RUDE and they don't want to work with you cause they are too lazy to do their job. I have a  Galpin Mazda service package I bought which is good for 6 years or 60k miles when I purchased my car this year and was told I will be able to use the service package at any Mazda or Galpin service place. The T.O Mazda service department wants to charge me a service fee or refuses to do service on my car. I even spoke to the service manager and he says they are not going to accept the service package cause Galpin is hard to deal with. They are making it hard for the customer because they are too lazy to do a little bit of work.  Van Nuys Mazda in the other hand are very helpful and are will take my car for service.<//Review>

Bought my car from Neftin VW and will drive 52 miles roundtrip for servicing though there are several dealerships nearby plus authorized VW shops.

<Response>None<//Response><rate>5<//rate><pics>None</pics><review>After we purchased our new Jetta my husband noted a 'nick' in the front windshield of my Jetta, something invisible to us in the dark when we first left.  We returned the next day, left the car and were provided a beautiful Volkswagen rental vehicle and came back that afternoon after Jason had a glass repair service try to plug the defect.  On our return, George personally inspected the vehicle with us and both he and my husband were not satisfied with the result.  Instead of sending us on our way, he asked for an additional day.  To make a long story short, we ended up with a new windshield and another full tank of gas.  There's more!  We were so happy with this result that we returned this past week with one of our sons who now too is a proud owner of a Neftin Volkswagen, a GTI.  Next in line is our son's girlfriend and our other son, both of whom will soon be seeking Neftin Volkswagen vehicles from George and Jason in the near future.  No matter who is assigned to deliver our vehicles, we will always deal directly with them in the future and have no plans to go anywhere else.  We consider ourselves part of the Volkswagen family and thank the team here for all they have done for us.  We look forward to our next visit!</review>< Gmap_id>

I worked with Cynthia in the internet sales department when I bought my new 2016 MX-5 Sport. It was without a doubt the best car buying experience I've ever had. I sent Cynthia an e-mail asking for a quote and she got me a great price on the car.

I am very particular when I buy a new car, and she was totally accommodating with all of my needs. I asked that she verify the odometer reading and that the car had not been test driven before, and specifically requested that the car not be washed so I could hand it directly over to my detailing guy. None of those things were an issue - she verified the odometer for me and secured the keys to the car in her office. I hopped in the car and drove over two hours to Neftin Mazda to pick up my new car. Absolutely worth the drive!

I'd test driven the new MX-5s at a few dealerships so I didn't feel the need to drive the car I'd be buying, but I inspected everything carefully and the car was perfect. I met Cynthia when I arrived and she's by far the most friendly and humorous sales person I've ever dealt with. We sat down and filled out the paperwork (which was a breeze!), took care of the financing side, and Cynthia even followed me to the gas station as I had requested to be the one that drives the car off the lot. I drove off with the biggest smile on my face in my new MX-5!

Let's review. Cynthia responded immediately to my calls and e-mails, is a Mazda enthusiast herself and is extremely passionate about the cars she sells, has encyclopedic knowledge of every new Mazda vehicle, has a fantastic sense of humor, and was completely straightforward and forthcoming throughout the entire purchase process. I might have to buy another Mazda just so I can work with her again!

It's not just her either. All of the other staff at Neftin Mazda were an absolute pleasure to work with, and the dealership itself is very nice. Everything is kept very clean and organized inside and the premises look great too.

All in all, I'd give far more than five stars if I could. If you're in the market for a new or used Mazda, send Cynthia an e-mail or give her a call and you'll never be disappointed. Hands down the best Mazda dealer in Southern California.< /Text>

I would like you to know that Max Rozi is what every salesperson should want to  be!  He is very knowledgeable about the product and patient with the customer. In addition to that, he had nothing but positive comments about the dealership, and in particular the "tone" of the dealership which is set by you.  Max went way out of his way to ensure that the deal went smoothly….even to the  point of picking up a forgotten key at our house.  He is about as polite a person as you could ever want to meet.  It was a pleasure having Max represent your dealership and handle the lease of The VW Passat. No doubt that we will recommend Neftin to our friends when they are looking to lease/purchase an automobile.  Hopefully the VW will perform as well as Max has!</Review>

Recently went to inquire about the 2014 Mazda 6. Customer service was terrible and pushy. It figures, no other customers were on the lot. I shopped many dealerships in ventura county and this was the worst experience. Try Bunnin Mazda of Ventura that's where I'm going!</Text>

<review>I’ll make this short.  I bought a used 2002 Jetta 1.8t in 2005 after coming home from Iraq. I paid 14K cash for it.  Like an idiot, I did not ask for a carfax because this was a “reputable” dealer.  It turns out I was having a lot of problems with my Jetta because it had been in an accident. The paint on the side it was hit went bad and needed repainted, needed a new clutch at only 70k miles, windows fell into the doors, oil leak at 75k miles, the ignitions coils went bad one at a time, and all over this well under 100K miles. I just got rid of it and felt compelled to write this review and say BUYER BEWARE! BEWARE! THEY WILL SELL YOU GARBAGE!

Costco is a great place to save money! It is wise to bring a list so you don't impulse buy. There items are very seasonal. I went to buy wool socks but the season had already passed.< /text>

Visit to Richmond Costco Sunday afternoon. Store was not crowded but found several personal hygiene items out of stock; i.e., male and female antiperspirants, bar soap and shampoo. Meats and poultry were semi scarce but seafood varieties were plentiful. Prices appear to be higher on nearly all items. Shelves stocked with bath tissue and paper towels.<//Review>

My son and I went to Costco  to renew our membership,after we got our membership up to current. We went shopping,  we found items we actually needed.  I was looking for a Jacket  for my son and I came upon this perfect  black jacket it fit him nice but the  only  was no tag on it so kept in my cart until  reach the register. The Costco team work their magic to get  a price tag  for this jacket.  This put a smile on my son face  thank you Costco  team you for helping with jacket  situation.</Text>

Much gratitude to the Costco team!

Thought for improvement: Aisles could do with a signage. Also, why are all of the size 10 JSport Poppy sandals on the bottom of the display? Had to unstack and restack a whole column to get to my size.</Review>

My mom and husband can't expect much help, but my very attractive young niece just goes to the back of the store and the guys that work the forklifts jump off and come a running. Lol. One of them offered to go with her in case she needed anything else heavy or high up. Smh<//Text>

<text>I enjoyed my grocery shopping here because it has everything,it's a pretty big store with many great products,workers are pretty helpful and one of the best things are the hot dogs and the pizzas like if you've never tried a Costco hotdog or pizza you're missing out.

Pleasant today.
In & out in 30 minutes.
Yet, no paper towels today.
Main reason for my trip.

Had input for a rep, why not provide Carpenter Jeans?
He was receptive & stated would forward to someone.

Overall: pleasant!<//Review>

Love costco.
You have to be a member to shop.
I usually pop in for the commissary,grab a hot dog or two.theyve recently cut back here .no more sauerkraut, and no polish dogs.
and you get a ramican of ketchup&mustard(i dont like them mixed...on a dog.)
But for the price😁you cant beat it.<//review>

The team is doing great. The customers could be doing better though. But why isn’t charcoal always in stock!? Y’all have ribs on special, but no charcoal. My only “complaint”<//text>

<username>Andrew Guenthner< /username><date>1604871249124< /date><rating>4<//rating><Text>Generally well-managed.  Crowds and lines are usually not too bad, and most shoppers are courteous.  Everything tends to be kept neat and clean.  Checkout is usually quick.  The location is convenient if driving but parking and particularly pedestrian access tends to be a hassle.  With AC Transit cutbacks, the neatest bus stop is more than a mile away, so for many this would require a car trip.<//Text>< pictures>

<Text>Pretty fast gas lines for the amount of volume.  The warehouse is usually pretty clean and well stocked.  This location can be EXTREMELY busy.  Choose your visit time wisely.  The pharmacy doesn't seem too busy but they are on the slow side. I was told ready in 30 minutes... it actually took 50. And there wasn't a lot of people there.</Text>< Resp>

Regarding the Tire dept. What can you say, this is a labor intensive job and it takes a toll physically, however it doesn't mean that you treat your customers with disrespect. Some of the guys at the tire shop are not very helpful and would rather refer you to their shift manager who is mysteriously never there. I get it, there maybe customers who tries to get everything for free, but most just want service done right with no BS excuses. Most of us customers just want to get in and out asap. Dear Richmond Costco Mgrs., Your tire dept people can use some customer service skills.< /Text>

I've never had the experience of buying anything at Costco and then seeing the same ting cheaper elsewhere. Costco treats employees well and is an ethical company. Always clean and although I wish they didn't move things around so much its always easy. they now when there will be a cold and they get lots of cashiers online to minimize checkout wait time. Never a question with any returns and yeah< /Text>

<text>Customer service was not cool I was told to stand in line and because my dad wasn’t there to show his membership card they’d just do what they call a 99 when I got to the register it was a whole different story my dad took my kids to eat while I shopped and was in route back but it was so embarrassing how they just pushed me to the side and made me feel like I was lying or trying to get over then the manager who had told me to get in line in the beginning just walked by and didn’t say a thing. I was so embarrassed</text>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>It’s a place where I go to buy what I need for myself and my family needs.  I also get my gifts for others from there as well.  The prices in Costco are very reasonable unless the same item is on sale at outside of the Wharehouse.  However, not every one item I purchase can really compare with store outside Costco.  I like their prices; it’s pretty reasonable, choices, and freshness. It’s a great place for family household, clothings, groceries, and personal items.  I prefer to purchase meats there is because I can find various cut of meats,  example, Beef, Pork, lamb, and chicken at Costco.  Therefore, I like that place for my weekly shopping.< /text>< pictures>

<review>Costco is amazing. Go earlier and you wont be disappointed. Lines will be short. Food court is amazing. 9.99 for a whole pizza. 1.99 for a hot dog and drink. Like crazy food deals for the car ride home. My kids love it. I get alot of things there. Main items: Cases of water,  tissue, paper towels, dove sensitive soap bars, toothpaste all main essentials for my household at amazing prices.... !!!!<//review>< Pics>

A great asset for the area!  Nice to fill up your car with gas there too.  Good selection of products.  Not too busy.  An interesting mix of shoppers: local Richmond people, UC Berkeley kids and staff, & others like me that work in the area & shop there on the way home to our own cities & towns nearby.  3/6/20: It was packed at 10:30 am, but I got gas for my car & vitamins.</text>

I am buying regularly some stuff from Costco except food, and especially fruit. Today I broken rule and bought walnuts in shell, packed in plastic bags. Walnut in shell, it can't be wrong, I thought. When I cracked wallnut it smells and taste something between plastic and mold. And again, I realised they simple don't care about any healthy storage of food.</text>

Shelter in Place Update -- wipes provided (recommend grabbing one before you grab your cart). Some signs will tell you if you can only grab 1 (eggs), some say no returns of purchased (rice, sanitation supplies, paper products). Went at 2 PM on Monday, there was no line and a few things out of stock (bulk eggs, paper products, etc.). Staff was very attentive and ensuring great sanitary practice. Thank you all and so grateful you were open for the community.<//text>

Had to stock up pandemic going back up. Wasn't crowded at 1600hours. Usually best to go early in the mornings. The parking was not bad at all.Costco didn't put much limit on items like water, baby wipes, paper towels.<//Text>

<text>Arrived at Richmond CA Costco at 7:55 today for first day of Senior Shopping Hour between 8 & 9. Longer line than I expected! Employees had line under control and got us inside pretty quickly. Given a wipe at the door to clean the cart handle and my hands. Once inside about the same crowd as a regular Costco day. Even scored some toilet paper, but they were all out of it by 8:55 when I left. Limited to one package per person. Well stocked with most items. All registers open and most had no line behind the person being checked out. Thanked every employee I passed by and each was appreciative of the acknowledgement that they were all working hard. All in all, a smooth shopping experience, considering the circumstances and the line to get in.</text>< Pics>

I was given misinformation about a product I was returning.  Then they tried to make me believe they were doing me a favor by taking the product back. Make sure you know the return policy before you by an item.<//review>

<review>Best place to shop! This SFO edition has a unique layout a bit confusing for what I am used. Great arrange of anything you need for the house, car, boat, bbq's you name it. You can expect the same quality across the nation. That is my friend The Costco Magic<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLNLEIgM1R1YNN9b8_Wv9hmYS_CiEWIa7D_rCy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNkiCjA_YqNQgpEOnoEj5wltm9S6YwZp415Yl5D=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQ-s-RGW_VycF52VC7aoDs_pQ3-xUzxwMxscdd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPmhyOEIbc_K3VHCJ4cM5fjlZx9Tdmz5H8sWmQs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808578e797263f71:0xaaf976e769f9e272<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>
<Time>1583813768854<//Time><review>I’ve never seen Costco without their cases full of meat .... they were actually out/nearly of chicken and beef and bison and turkey it’s crazy. No/very little water,  empty shelves everywhere! Clearly it’s not at the fault of Costco it’s all of us. Thank goodness the Martians aren’t here! If we all just relaxed... are prudent, and considerate of our fellow human, I think everything would be just fine.<//review><Name>Ross Rosenzweig< /Name>< gmap_id>

<Review>What a horrible experience to drive 30min to shop only to find out they actually close at 7pm and not 830pm as it is listed on Google maps. Perhaps I remember incorrectly, but I swear I've been there after 7pm on Saturday, again I could be wrong about that.

The icing on the cake was being laughed at by employees and told that the hours hadn't changed and that Google maps was playing jokes on them by changing the hours . . . seriously???</Review>< pics>

< review>
I went to this Costco last week always packed great customer service no complaints. The only thing that bothers me now is that on YouTube I have been seeing more and more videos about Costco's having worms in their food so it's very lenient about buying meat. To tell you the truth I decided not to Buy any meat from them.</review>

Plenty of parking even when kind of crowded, almost allnof the registers open for speedy checkout. Some of the cashiers are hella slow, like "I aint hurryin for NOBODY". U can fill in the blanks. But this is generally a great costco. The gas station is also updated.<//text>

<Review>We went on a Sunday afternoon, which was definitely the busiest time to go. Surprisingly with all the people, parking wasn't too bad. You just have to have a little patience.  Lines were moving pretty quickly, and they had all the registers working. Prices seemed pretty good, but you have to do some checking on the better values. We also got Costco gas, and the lines moved very fast, even with all the lines. All and all, my trip was pretty good. But next time I  will go on a weekday.<//Review>< rate>

Lately the Richmond Costco has lost it's great service & not as clean and organized as it was before. Also entire bay area Costco don't have the items advertised as savings items, the staff has no idea if & when they'll get them..really it is total BS</Text>

Whew child...this pandemic got Costco like a war zone. The line was wrapped around the building like a food pantry line. But it went quickly once they open the doors. Kirkland toilet paper and paper towels were plentiful but you can only buy one per membership.</Text>

Photo & prints quality & that department is great. Some & not all staff members: I recommend being extra careful with customers prints with cleanliness & professionalism.  Recommendation is wear proper mask 😷 during Covid19 & do not keep touching your nose nonstop trying to move up your handkerchief mask onto your nose & at the same time touching customers prints. Pls change gloves if u are to handle prints. I am not able to alcohol spray or sanitize my prints bc the ink will come off . Pls hold gently large prints to prevent also do not bend & dents & having to redo. Thank u & I would appreciate it.< /Text>

Covid compliant for the most part. Depends on time of day and day of week as to crowds. Outside lines can be challenging. I will maintain 6ft distancing and mask. Will ask those in the line with me to also comply. Up to us individually to protect ourselves from those who refuse to see the value of doing so. Masks are so vital.</review>

<Name>Nibiru LLC< /Name><response>None<//response><Pics>None< /Pics><Text>Right on the border of Richmond but by the Bay, off 580. A big parking lot but the only close Costco for San Leandro to Richmond. There is one in Oakland but it's smaller. So this place is packed.although staff is great and getting you moving, especially since covid they have made it more customer friendly and a faster process checking out. FYI forget about the hot dogs that a whole different situation. There is a long line and moves much slower. Gotta love them< /Text>< Date>

We visited on a completely packed Saturday. It was a bit difficult to navigate but we found what we were looking for and were able to checkout relatively quickly.

We got really wonderful puppy food, some beer, and creme brulee. A random scavenger hunt of value that always pays off.<//Review>

If you want to increase your chances of catching the COVID-19 virus!! Then come here. Customers aren’t wearing face coverings, social distancing is nonexistent. The truly tragic part! Employees aren’t wearing face covering.  I went there and COSTCO here this! If I catch the virus, expect a law suit for my medical care. There are employees hawking food items, walking down the aisles but, no one enforcing face coverings.  Yeah COSTCO, profit over someone life.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I was nervous to go to Costco since I haven't been there since early December. I hate long lines and was dreading having to stand in one.  I went before 10 am and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was. No long lines. Greeted at the door with a sanitizer wipe. Everybody wearing masks and not getting too close. No long lines at checkout and everybody helpful. Anecdotally, since this was my first trip to Costco since early December, I can honestly say that a big package of Costco toilet paper used by two older people and some kids and guests  can make it through both the holidays and shelter in place. Bravo!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

The "shopper spirit" and I rarely connect, so I'm usually in a get -it-done frame of mind, and the Costco staff I encounter,  seem to be right there with me - in a really good way.

They successfully achieved their goal of deep discount bulk pricing on a wide arrangements of household goods, food, and paper products.  They're $4.99 rotisserie chickens and dollar fifty for hot dog and Coke can't be beat.  Checkout lines are often very long and impossible during the holiday season.  Parking is tight also.  Store is clean.  As typical with Costco there is little or no customer service.  Their pharmacy and optical pricing are very competitive.  Lots of free food samples at the end of each isle.  The annual membership fee is worth it if you use the store more than occasionally or share the card with a friend or are a small businesses.  Super friendly return policy.  televisions and electronics are very competitively priced.  Not worth your time if you're only picking up one or two items.  Good prices on both national brands and Costco's in House Kirkland brand.  Best gasoline prices in the area.< /text>

<Review>I’ve been to numerous other Costcos in the Bay Area, and this has by far been the most saturated, highest customer to employee ratio I’ve ever seen. This location needs more employees to handle the other unused registers to minimize customer wait times. This Costco location needs to adapt to the higher customer visits with MORE cashiers. Costco is great with variety and pricing and love visiting their other locations such as Novato.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWqrL6n2eVsOT6-4LorTdk7QrpMNzIKfjZwG67=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMxCy6e0doPN6BTmbWadAwJTG0aMaqSNWLAigoY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Most Covid precautions have been lifted. There were many kids and too many people. Although masks are required, more than a few individuals were wearing their mask below their mouth- this included some employees as well. Sanitizer was not easily available to wipe down cart. Three weeks ago everything was great. Sorry to see precautions were so lax already.</text>

The worst Costco ever. I parked my vehicle here late night. Then was harassed by security in a rudest manner. Guy on a black security Dodge yelled at me with foul language. Can't believe he worked for Costco. Customers money are going to pay salary to this guy. And then he harassed customers. I will get rid of my golden membership.

Update: I reported this incident to the store manager Megan. She promised to call back and never called.<//Text>

Beside the general awesomeness that Costco has going for itself consistently, I will just review this location specifically. The staff here are almost always wonderful to work with (of course you'll eventually run into someone who's having a bad day), but always very polite.

The concession food area is generally clean, but considering the foot traffic of that area, it's hard to maintain every single minute, so bring a few napkins to wipe the table if you plan on sitting down to eat. The staff at the concessions are also very efficient and quick, so waiting in a long line shouldn't deter you from getting any food because you'll be up there quicker than you may think.

The bathrooms are clean and well maintained for such a high traffic location.

The selection here is amazing, with special seasonal items offered too, so look out for those because they may be hidden in between the larger always in-stock items.

The only downside to this location is the fact that there aren't many sample stands as the San Leandro location. Unfortunately, there are only a few samples going on and even at its max, it's not as many as the SL location's usual offer. As a vegetarian, it doesn't even matter because it's usually something I cannot eat, but for those omnivores, it's not as fun as trying out all the samples at the SL location.

Regardless, I highly recommend this location for food, gasoline, groceries, and basically everything offered by Costco. Keep a lookout for special seasonal items!< /review>

<review>Good place to buy all the things that you need on daily and regular basis. I dont know why costco feels being expensive these days (is it due to market or inflation). But anyways costco is good choice for everyone.

I would like to call costco as, get everything at one place, easy and effective.</review><Time>1546892334110</Time><rate>5< /rate><Name>Abishek Gyawali< /Name><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOiKbZjb4YkztYtWQ6Nt2-PA6FGneZOiAWdflm1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNs9mI2tsKbxVUf9Rl99DYOfTEmaC5TLyoebkv4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOL8W2ba9KcqGNaByNKl98QE2yt2XsCmkU_QLnQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2TI4k1qZfZUTWBnUY30O7RlWbi6Vn_H3y_Bm_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< user>

The costco I consistently go to. Not much to say about it since its Costco. But they've been great over the years. No issues and they always take returns back without any questions. If you dont have a membership remember you legally can purchase alcohol and visit the pharmacy without a membership. Just tell them at the entrance that you intend to do either of those and they have to let you in.< /text>

< Review>
This is the best location for me, in and out with no problem. As far as parking, I always park on the street to avoid the parking lot nightmare 😬. Right now they have the plush thick throw blanket for $9.99, perfect gift idea for everyone my 4 yr grdson claimed his last night. Now if a 4yr old know what to do when he sees something good, come on now!🤔</Review>

<text>Overall it’s so so. The cashiers can be rude. The workers working on the floor can rude and will ignore you if you need help and if you happen to ask ‘where can i find (something)?’they will say anything like there’s none. But then After asking around later I ended up finding  the item myself.
Also the sample people can be rude not all of them but some are most of them are.  I have double sampled  because I grabbed an extra for my child and some workers have looked at me so bad.. so rude. But some are nice. Some cashiers are rude. Some of  The workers that check the membership cards at entrance can be so rude also. But i keep going to  Costco
Because of the deals and items I cannot find anywhere else.<//text>< pictures>

Definitely worth the membership. Always a great place to shop, plenty of parking and great savings! Pizza is always fresh, under $10 for a whole. The gas is good quality and usually the best price around. Overall, costco is one stop shop for anything you may need. Definitely recommend Costco.< /Review>

The price of prescription glasses are better here than anywhere else.  There is often a line, so it is wise to plan for that - bring something to read and relax.  Services are acceptable most of the time and good some of the time.  I have purchased 5 pairs of glasses and sun glasses here and all of them were good quality.  The selection here is decent.  I decided to give up some styles I prefer to take advantage of the ease of ordering and picking glasses up, as well as the cost savings of Costco.</text>

It’s too busy to go there and maintain your sanity. Parking is a nightmare, and if you want to get gas, prepare to wait 20 minutes in order to save $3. This area needs a second Costco to take the pressure off this one.<//Review>

<text>I really like this Costco, it’s not too big and the service is very friendly. They usually have most of the stuff I need. I sometimes go to the San Leandro Costco for a bigger selection but it’s much more crowded there. So we mostly go this Richmond Costco which is conveniently close to our house.
Parking us crowded especially on weekends but if you go when they open or near closing time, it’s very easy to park and shop time wise.
We also come here for the less expensive gas and the lines move pretty fast.</text></record>

Even with a mad Friday rush and everyone trying to get necessities, i was through the line in 5mins.  Few things were out, but that's to be expected.  Otherwise really happy to be able to get in and out so quickly.< /Text>

Well I love Costco! I find things which I never knew I absolutely needed and in bulk. Haha
This particular location is pretty good, they're pretty well stocked, not as crazy crowded as the ones in south bay, plenty of parking, and even the lines to get gas are not bad.< /text>

<text>Love this store! Bought a heavy piece of furniture and a lot of very friendly staff showed up to help load it on our cart. Once we paid and left we were attempting to load it in the truck another staff person showed up to help us load it. Totally unexpected and extremely helpful, I can't give the staff enough credit for their helpfulness and great attitude! The quality of goods here is excellent and I love the prices.<//text>< name>

They opened up new checkstands right away when they noticed too many people in line. Cashier was polite and patient with woman struggling to remember her pin number for her debit card. Not rushing her helped her stay calm and remember.<//Review>

Always well stocked and neat. Great variety and prices. Cashiers friendly and efficient.  I just wish they wouldn't get me hooked on items that they don't always carry. And the number of sample stations are annoying to me although I know that they are popular with shoppers.</review>

Look, it’s Costco. This is a fantastic location. Well run and tidy.

If you don’t like crowds and parking further away, why are you considering Costco...
It’s busy.

PRO TIP: Do yourself a huge favor and park in the area by the gas station. Yeah, you’ll walk a few yards further but you’ll avoid the stress of aggressive/anxious people waiting 10 minutes to get a tiny bit closer. (Lol...ironically, they wait for parking just to walk into Costco, where anyone could easily walk a mile.)</Text>

A huge place which is always crowded! You should prepare yourself with some time and being pacient with the lane. The customer service is great and the employees are friendly and really helpful! The parking lot is huge but due to the amount of people that comes to this places, sometimes is hard to find a place to park your car.</Text>

< review>
This is pretty much a typical Costco. They havevthe inside food service with the usual hot dogs and pizza along with soda and the Mocha Freeze.  They no longer sell the Polish dogs though.

Weekends they generally have enough sample tables to provide a meal.  This is a right handed store which means that when entering, the entrance is on the right and exit on the left.

Tire center is on thevparking lot side and is usually very busy.  They do sell gas at this location.<//review>

This is a larger Costco so the selection is greater.
Busy, getting in and out can be a little convoluted.
For gas be sure to go to the end of the road. There is no access to the gas from the parking lot.
I would not advise large RVs or long trailers it is a little cramped.< /review>

< Review>
Saturday around noon is not the best time to shop. Parking lot is packed (made worse by rude incourtious drivers), and the store is of course wall to wall oblivious people which makes getting up & down isles take twice as long as normal. Checkouts were jammed, but moved well & checkers had amazingly good attitudes, even with customers who refused to unpack ANY of the items in their overflowing cart & made them scan each item in the cart.  For THAT alone I give 4 stars!<//Review>

I wish though that members shopping would pay more attention to what's going on around them.  Especially when they're grabbing samples.   Too many of them are just ok with blocking the aisle while they think about doing nothing but stuffing their faces & they don't even think about saying thank you to those hard working Demonstrators.
Other than that, I  LOVE COSTCO!!!</text>< gmapID>

It's a Costco, not much changes in the content. However space is tight and it is extremely busy. That makes parking and finding things much more difficult than other Costco's. Surprisingly, there was almost no wait in line. Probably because everyone was out Mad Maxxing in the parking lot.</text>

<review>What can you say that hasn't been said. Your warehouse purchasing. LOTS of people , like everywhere prices are creeping up. Parking is always a challenge, be patient. Good selection of Seafood and Meats. They had all check stands open so even though their were lots of people lines moved incredibly fast. So for what they do and how they do it. 5 stars in my book.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<text>Always packed but our check out experience was smoothly for a change, every lane was open and about 2-3 people vs the absurd looong lines.

Even the food court ran smoothly BUT there was NO ICE. Looks like ice machine ran out of ice. I literally had 3 cubes of ice in my cup.< /text>< Date>

Way too crowded, parking is a ridiculous task, very disorderly shelves, cashiers much slower and much more rude compared to any other Costco I’ve been to. It’s very clear that this location is overwhelmed in this over-populated part of the east bay and theres a desperate need for another location in Berkeley!< /review>

Good election of groceries, fast service and always see the personnel working hard. I have observed the meat dept. People, bakery, produce, dairy, etc. Rotation best practices are good... but front lanes people are kind of rude most of the time, they should  put more effort in customer service standards. Just saying...< /text>

This is by far the worst Costco I have ever been to. It is always so busy and not enough cashier. I purchased a pizza and they made me wait for an hour. I should it went to little ceasar if had known. I avoid going to this Costco but it was on my way home and I had an urgent matter that I ended up missing because of this place.live and learn never going back if I can help it. Where is the minus reviews.</review>

This Costco is pretty standard for a Costco. There are a lot of things available for sale at a very low price that you can't really get in surrounding stores. If you can get here, I'd definitely recommend coming here to shop< /text>

Massive shopping club store with great deals. You can even buy prescription glasses and prescription medication. The stores seem to be set up exactly the same no matter where you are in the U.S. once you learn one location's layout, you are good for finding items in the other Costco stores.<//review>

COSTCO is nearby and consistently the least expensive gas in my neighborhood so I go there to fill my tank. I like strolling through the warehouse to see what's new. Besides, I easily get my Fitbit steps in wandering through COSTCO.</review>

They Finally took away The wooden Palates as Barricades for the entrance, and they went back to normal hours, and I noticed more items are more accessible now than before due to the Pandemic. Hopefully we can all go back to normal soon.<//Review>

Customer service guys were great! 2 ladies at register 17 were trying to make a Hair appointment while helping myself and the lady before me. They were actually on their phones texting as they were helping me. I have a good since of humor and just shook my head thinking, "Well I am in Richmond, so HOOD tendencies should be expected."< /text>

<Text>I like Costco, this location is one of the closest grocery stores to my house. Great for bulk buying. However, don't buy bagged citrus here if you're not gonna use it today; they've had a citrus mold problem here for the last two years or so and your entire bag will mold in a week once you've taken it home. Also, there are usually lines here, ~5 carts deep.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>Their Sundae’s at the cafe is pretty decent. Also $4.99 passport photos are by far the cheapest I’ve found anywhere. Parking on a weekend is challenging. It would be nice if this Costco had a 5 minute pick-up parking area by the front door so patrons can drive their cars just to pick up. Also, cell phone reception seems spotty here.<//Text>< pictures>

Great place for deals. I come primarily to Costco for bulk food (we are just 2, so it's not like you need to run a restaurant or have a family of 4 for it to make sense - just have some space to freeze some stuff) plus Costco is our go-to place when we have friends over or organizing a party (disposable serving stuff and great snacks). Costco also offers great deals in spirits, the only downside is that the bottles are usually huge (1.75L) and come with an ugly handle, so they are not very pretty to display in your home bar. Finally, I monitor their website for electronics deals: they occasionally offer great discounts on high-end products - we just got a surface pro 6 with $300 off.
In just 4 months we have saved much more than their subscription fee so I definitely recommend it for people looking to save money!< /review>

This place can be a madhouse, but they keep up pretty well.  The sample folks usually seem like they might want to kill you, but doing that job, I could understand why.  The customer service folks are always friendly.  Food court is always a cheep and easy snack.</Review>

Costco was amazing, breath taking one might say.  My second son will be named Costco, joyful and big. But jokes aside, great service and great prices, lots of parking, I go there often.be sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring water. It's huge.< /text>

If you need to make a return I advise you walk in the exit. If you like to come for the samples, the weekend is the best time. I recommend buy alcohol from here, great deals!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<Review>Costco is always a good deal for quality. Allot of folks don't also realize you get many more savings from their other services as well if you do some research (Costco auto program as an example). My only beef is that it feels like Walmart sometimes but the deals are still excellent.</Review>< Pictures>

Great place for gasoline and groceries.  This is the best place you can go to get premium groceries in bulk and other items.  I've always liked the quality of the commodities that costco carries and they have the best return or replace policy in the industry.< /Text>

<Review>I use my mom's membership card to usually come in here for 2 hot dogs, and then I like to walk around and look at all the great stuff they have for sale. 10/10 would eat and shop here again. They also have fantastic gasoline here. My wallet and my car love it.<//Review>< Pics>

Great meat, cheese and a great return policy.  Wish the produce was fresher, but there are a lot of other places w good produce.  Most importantly Costco pays a living wage and gives hood benefits.</review>

Large warehouse, member shopping for groceries and many other items.  Plenty of parking except just before Christmas. There is normally one quality brand of each item, so not a place for "specialty" items. Organic and traditional meats.  Most packages are large (milk comes 2 gallons at a time).  Good selection of organic items.  Fresh vegetables are not as good as Monterey Market, but frozen foods are good quality.</text>

<review>Gas station has 3 pumps on most islands at Richmond location. That really helps speed up the wait. Because each Costco increasingly carries different items at different locations, I am frequently frustrated that I cannot find an item at one Costco that is readily available at another. I understand each Costco now tries to cater more to it's particular geographic and demographic location, so sometimes you can discover something you never knew Costco carries. Be aware it is not always less expensive to buy stuff at Costco than other stores.< /review>< pictures>

This one along with San Leandro are by far the worst Costco's in the Bay Area.  The parking is horrible, the lines are long no matter what day and/or time you're there and some of the staff are so unprofessional.  There are a few exceptional employees that go the extra mile.  Ryan T and Shannon (Tire Center) and Francisco to name a few.</review>

<text>There's usually parking at this location and the gas line isn't too bad. Extended weekend hours would be nice. One thing to keep in mind at the register is that the employees here will give you a really hard time if the Costco card does not belong to you i.e. it's your husband's, wife's card etc. In one occasion, the employees were really aggressive towards my fiancé when I left the checkout line to go use the bathroom.<//text>< resp>

The best! Paying lower quality price for a premium Gas.
As it's  usual with big companies nobody can compete with their prices for a top quality product.
Tends to be a wait line most of the time but remember that their hose can reach either side of your car so don't necessarily need to wait for a specific side to pump.<//review>

Parking can be crazy and expect to wait in line st check out. Selection, prices, and quality are good. Selections rotate out, so you may not always get something if it becomes your favorite.< /review>

Costco in Richmond is great.  One problem I have with them is their gas price.  Although the gas prices are better than local stations they are about 10 cents higher per gallon than Costco in Concord.  Kind of strange given most people in Concord have a higher income than most people in Richmond.<//Text>

Great prices. Usual Costco stuff that you would expect. Just check the time when they are busy before you go. Google shows you the trends. This is one of the busiest stores I have seen and heard someone saying that it is the busiest in northern California.</Review>

Love Costco.  This Costco seems to be the busiest that I've been to and I try to avoid it on the weekends, but it's kinda fun to weave between the carts and swoop in for a sample.  Most staff are friendly, cashiers have been a miss from time to time...snail slow!<//Review>

<Text>Who doesn’t love Costco?!  It’s the happiest place on earth :)  I recommend coming early (before 11) on the weekends for the quickest trip in and out, or coming after 6:30 pm during the weekdays.  Otherwise it’s an absolute madhouse and will make you hate humanity.</Text>< pics>

This place works hard to carry local products. We bought some amazing local salami, and the person who served samples was the salami business owner and said Costco kept pushing him to sell through them, and he resisted, saying his company was just too small. Finally, he relented, and he said we had better get some because the supply was very very limited. This dramatically changed my view of this local Costco.</Review>

Costco is slipping fast from it's original customer value.  Prices and inventory, also the entire experience.  Someone will hopefully give them some competition so they get back to the original focus.</Review>

The lines are too long. Not enough cashiers.  And you may have to wait inline for the roasted chickens. Very crowded. Inside store, freeway, as well as parking lot. This place is awesome, but the wait us not worth it, I have things too see and do.< /text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>This is a fully decent Costco, with few flaws except maybe parking when you're feeling lazy. No other major businesses nearby. Amazing view of SF from the nearby dog park. Newly installed pumps (and more of them), so the gas line moves along quickly, and every other service lives up to the quality you expect from Costco.< /text></record>

The lines seem to go a little slower at this Costco compared to others. Parking is also not too good. Other than the one in San Leandro, this is my least favorite Costco. 3 stars still because I love Costco.</review>

I have 6 kids, my nephew, daughter in law and granddaughter with me, so needless to say I have to shop in bulk! I only just became a Costco member last year but if I would've know all that they sell I would've joined long ago. I believe their still having buy one membership at the executive level and get one free. I'm not one to buy generic brand products but decide to try there kirkland brand, as it says to compare. I was sold after that and as much as I spend there the membership basically pays for itself.< /Text>

<Response>None</Response><text>The Costco itself is ok. Costco stock up the items good and members are helpful. The check out and parking however is a different issue. Always long line at the check out. Sometimes the savings is not even worth waiting in line just for a few items. The parking is a headache - always busy and people are not courteous, always angry. Most Costco are like this though specially lunch and after office hours - everyone is doing their errands on those times. Weekend is even bad. It's frustrating to shop at Costco sometimes.<//text>< name>

< review>
Very bad customer service at this particular warehouse location. Love the parent company Costco but would not recommend this store because of the bad experience that I had to go through. Tried talking to the supervisor who understood what I was saying, had no answer to why my daughter who didn't have the card wasn't allowed to get in while I am parking the car (she told them that I am coming) and the lady at the gate felt like she is the big bad cop and told me that's why she is standing there to not let the people without cards get in. What a bad service to the actual card holder? When I asked the real reason for this stupid act, there was no satisfactory answer except that Costco is only for the members. When I asked why my daughter had to wait at the gate while I was parking the car, they had no answer. This is not the first trip to a Costco warehouse bur definitely the worst experience.<//review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Text>Costco prices are good, but don't have too many Organic food choices and move the products all around every week and make the customers confused. Perhaps they do that, so people discover the new products and buy more. I recommend Costco make a section for new arrivals and I bet that section would be the most visited section by customers!< /Text>< Pictures>

A lot of the items are constantly moved around so each time we go there we can't find what we are looking for. I ask the employees for help and often they don't even know where the items are because each week they are in a different place. Othertimes they just run out or stop selling the food we like. The employees were really nice, but when even they don't know where their stuff is, then you know the organization of the stores product placement has a problem. Costco please put your food items in the same place week to week!</review>

<text>Why are the lines always so long here.  Then we had to stand in what felt was an equally long line to have the receipt checked before we could walk to and load the car.  Of course we even had cars following us stalker like in the parking lot as they are searching for a space in the totally full lot.  Not worth it to come shop here.  The modest savings are overshadowed by long lines/waits.....</text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Costco remains one of the best places for bulk shopping. Everything there tends to be excellent value but it's expensive since you buy everything in bulk. If you are stocking up on nonperishable items or bulk shopping for lots of people then it's hard to beat this store.</Review></record>

This is pretty much your typical Costco. They have a good supply and selection with great prices on bulk items. However, parking is always a bit of a challenge and the parking lot is usually difficult to navigate. This Costco is also always crowded and the lines to actually checkout can be espically long. Avoid peak shopping hours!< /text>

<review>Do NOT buy your flowers there. I used to buy lovely flowers at Costco that lasted forever, but no more. For the past couple of years, they have been BAD!!!! I just bought a bouquet of 5 hydrangeas yesterday for $9.99. Nineteen hours later, they are completely wilted! If I had the time and energy, I would take them back.</review><Rate>1< /Rate><response>None<//response>< Pics>

<review>What can I say...I live here. I spend more $$ here than I ever would have expected, but never have buyers remorse. They have pretty good quality stuff and by all accounts very good quality food.

I'll be the first to admit that its weird to be shopping organic on the Costco level. But Ive been satified with what Ice brought home. Ill still go to the butcher if I want something special, but these guys are on it when it comes to quality.

And they're simply unmatched in CS. People return stuff that I would be embarrassed to do. Used, shredded, half eaten...you name it, they take it. Unbelievable.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

< Review>
Typical Costco.  Good prices.  Loads of temptations.  Gas line a mile long.  My only complaint would be the customers.  They block the aisle in the parking lot waiting for a spot near the entrance.  I'm talking about 20 to 30 somethings.  There's always a spot 50 to 100 feet away. Lazy maybe,  or just IQs a little lower than Forrest Gump???

Once inside its almost as bad.  These stores have super wide aisles,  but when a group of 4 or 5 folks with cars decide to stop and chat you finally have to ask them to make way.  The result is usually a dirty look and a 30 second wait while they grudgingly move.

All in all it's not Costco's fault,  just a sign of the deteriorating world we live in.  The prices still make it worth the trouble.</Review>

The parking lot is very dark at night.  The store was the same as other Costco stores.  There were a lot of people and a long line to return items.  The employees that I interacted with were helpful.<//Text>

<Review>A sad fool checking receipt at this location around 3.30pm told my 6 year old daughter who handed him our receipt & asked him to draw her a happy face too told her "sorry i cant draw you a happy face right now because am too busy" with a mean straight face. How dare he say that to a happy child. I mean if you don't like your job why don't you quit it & let other happy people do the job you are so sad to work. Crazy guy! No eye contact no smile how awful toward a child who gave him a receipt...great location but my very first horrible experience with a child.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

I love Costco, and this one here is no exception; it's extremely busy and getting in and out can be a real challenge. About a block before you get to the store, they have a four way stop sign that you have to fend for yourself and don't assume other understand what a stop sign mean.

They do have some slight varieties that the Antioch one doesn't have and this Costco has more "hyper active customers" than the others I've been to.

Their food to go hot dog and pizza area could use a redesign.. the lunch traffic can cause the shopping carts to be backed up.<//review>

You have to be careful at costco though, often times the price per oz/lb are the same as you might get other places but, all in all I think you get a better deal.  They also have excellent quality meat, some of the best, but hard to buy 6 or 8 tbone steaks at a time.  And you can't beat the hot dog deal!</Review></record>

Getting here from 80 E is a nightmare after 5 pm, but that's not Costco's fault.  The parking lot is huge and always full.  Costco is always busy but has the best prices on rotisserie chickens, and hot dogs.  Their clothing selection is excellent value.   They carry bulk quantities of all necessities and staples, plus a little more all at a fair price, however it rare to find a steal at Costco.

Another note Costco is legendary with their returns<//Text>

<text>For your vision health, don't go to Costco vision center for lens!

I ordered new lens for my frame. After I got my glass, it was not easy for my eyes to focus on the screen, I could easily get eye strain. Then I went to see the doctor, after examinations, she thought maybe because of the defect of my eyes' muscle, which caused strabismus. But I never had this problem before.

Then I bought a new pair of glass elsewhere, my vision became normal. Then I went to see the doctor again, after examinations, doctor told me my eyes were OK, I didn't have strabismus. The reason for the problem can be caused by the lens I ordered from costco, my frame was not small, and the optical center of the frame was far way from my actual pupils' location, which can cause distortions.

When I ordered the lens, I realized costco even didn't measure my pupils' location when I wear my frames. They just measure the pupil distance. Now I find the reason for eye strain after investigations, but it's already been more than half year since I bought it, so I cannot get any refunds from costco...

Here is my recommendations:
If your prescription is high (my prescription is -4.5 R, -5.0 L), and also your frame is not small, which means when you wear your frame, your pupils are off the geometric center of the frame (actually this is true for most people.) DO NOT go to costco, go to a glass store where they will mark your pupils' location when you wear the frame.

I hope my review can help the people who have the similar symptom after ordering glasses from costco.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Small COSTCO that has what I need.  I quickly get a bite to eat at the food court, shop at the electronics, bakery, deli, meat and produce areas and on my way out, I grab food samples as well as gas.< /text>< pics>

Yesterday 05/01/19 at photo department at 2:30 pm the lady worker was so stupid and rude to us. She hated us the time she sees us and showed us a really bad face. So I want you guys to keep an eye on and work on it.< /review>

<rating>4</rating><review>Although I live considerably closer to the Davis St San Leandro location, because of the noticeable difference in both the
type and quality of products between stores, I make the traffic filled trek over to this location. Despite the better tasting and less spoiled produce, or the far superior bread choices, the best feature of this store is the specialty meat counter they just recently added. Honestly, the trip tip steak I purchased this past week was one of the best steaks I’ve ever tasted in my life hands down, and this is coming from a self proclaimed beef connoisseur. Next time you’re their, do yourself the favor and treat yourself to one of these prime cuts, you won’t regret it. Helpful tip, the specialty meat counter doesn’t really follow a typical schedule, so if you’re lucky enough to be there when it’s open, take full advantage of this rare opportunity, because it might be your only chance for awhile. I’ve been shopping at Costco on certain days and times with them open, to only go back a week or two later to find the specialty meat counter closed :-(.<//review>< Pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><text>Horrible service. Totally inconsistent with what I expect from Costco. It took 30min, a staff member, a supervisor and a manager, along with an in depth discussion just to return a pair of sunglasses that broke (lens fell out) two weeks after I bought them. The assistant asserted that sunglasses need to be in a sellable condition to be returned - which is ridiculous because if they were in a sellable condition, I wouldn't have needed to return them. Her body language and tone gave me the feeling that I was somehow trying to cheat the system. A supervisor came in and said that a manager needed to authorize the transaction. The manager, who was really nice, then came over and said that there was nothing wrong with returning them and that some people abuse the process and then authorized it and it was no problem.

Further - I was unable to have the transaction processed - even after approved by a manager - as I didn't have the card that the original transaction was made with -- the system couldn't auto-refund to the original card, and I was not allowed to have the money refunded in cash or to another card (even another Costco Visa) -- I was told that if I couldn't present the card with the same 4 digits, the transaction. Fortunately, my wife was with me in the store, and was able to interrupt her shopping to bring the card over.

The sunglasses weren't even bought through the optical department. I'll never buy another pair of sunglasses at Costco again.< /text>< pics>

<text>I love Costco...it is absolutely my favorite retail outlet.  However,  the help at the Richmond location is among the most unfriendly at any warehouse I've been to.

Every time I come here, I say hello to each of the employees that I pass by and not a single one can return the greeting.  Tonight, I accidentally cut off an employee heading to the back with cardboard.  I apologized, but he didn't even acknowledge me.

Normally, the cashiers are rude, too.  But tonight he was pretty cool.  I believe his name was Joey.

If this location didn't carry items I cannot get at the one closest to my house, I would not bother going back.  But, sadly, I have to, if I want these items.<//text></record>

Store layout makes sense. Exceptional supply of organic, non-gmo food products, fresh and frozen, and wild, pole-caught fish. Keep your eyes peeled for the unexpected, the specials, the snacks and get in a couple thousand steps that day.</Review></record>

I have been a member of Costco since it opened in El Cerrito 1986 and what l don't like about it is the parking is horrible no matter when you go and you actually run out of merchandise.  In addition not many of your employees are friendly, for the first time in my membership. I don't like going there.  Still love the products and the great deals.</review>

Don’t get me wrong, I freakin’ love Costco... Especially their $1.50 hot dog and soda.  But this Costco is so disgustingly crowded at all times of the day that it’s just not worth my sanity to try to come here for a cheap breakfast, lunch or dinner... and that makes me sad.<//Review>

I might just be used to the Costco back in my hometown, but this one was a wreck. You need a membership even if you're just headed inside to get a hotdog or pump gas, both of which were not the case back in NY. I couldn't even get a regular membership, the guy at the counter kept trying to pressure me into the double priced executive one. I eventually got it just to get it over with and plan downgrade later. Even in the middle of the day on a Thursday there were huge lines everywhere. Again, I might have just grown up near the best Costco ever and this is all perfectly reasonable, but I wouldn't count on it.<//review>

Love it, except that you have to pay $60 annual fee to get in.  They have some food samples during weekend.< /Review>

Enormous super sized market where you can save a lot of dollar. Bad thing is the mix is limited and you are forced to buy distribution size product. The chicken is the what's worth it!< /review>

Parking can be horrible and gas lines are always long so prepare yourself.
Try to come when it's not too crowded.
It's still Costco so it's great it most of the employees are outstanding.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808578e797263f71:0xaaf976e769f9e272< /gmapID></record>

Filled The Tanky With Gas.

Filled The Fridgy With Juice.

Filled The Freezy With Food.

Time To Veg Out & Work Out.

Got Gas At The Richmond CostCo & Also Did Some Grocery Shopping.

Went Early In The Morning And Had A Short Wait For Everything; Which Was Not Too Bad.

With Nozzles That Stretch To The Other Side Of Your Tank: It Does Not Matter Which Side Of The Gas Station Pump You Drive Up To.

Got A 3 Pack Of Tropicana Juice On Stacks. Reached In That Cooler, And Pulled Out.

Had A Prempted Pland Of Prepared Meals Of Sauté Vegetables Sauce & Rice. Yes I Did.<//text>

<Text>What can i say. Everything is in bulk. They don't carry stuff like any other costco. For example: san leandro and concord sell tobasco and yoshida sauce not in richmond. There are some unhappy staff most of the time. You will notice it when times get busy. There is this african american staff who sweep the floor underneath us. He does say "excuse me" but that's just rude. Hello you don't bug people while eating. You tell them to move there leg. So you can sweep the floor. Do it when were done. That's just rude.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

A veritable jungle of consumer choices, this spectacular palace of products, is more a humanitarian experience  than a shopping trip.
Well paid employees,  and thoughtful shoppers, families mostly who take saving money and planning ahead seriously  are the regulars here, and despite the enormity, a quality I always equated with sub standard products,  CostCo has their formula down pat.  Great deals on meant and staples, as well as a wide variety of consumer electronics,  I pray that they keep a share of the market in a globally amazoning marketplace.
To wit: they have anything and everything you could need.
Memberships vary, but start at around $60 a year.
TIPS: Raw honey, Organic Almond butter, and  Prime steaks are always a great deal here.</Review>

<Text>Costco is great when u have a large family, but not when u are single. I never finish any of the foods I buy in bulk and end up throwing it away. P.S. the people who work here are a little odd and the shoppers are even odder. A little on the low class side. They suffer from cart envy.< /Text><rating>3< /rating>< user>

<review>This Costco is always too crowded.  I go just before closing, but there still are long lines, and there are no food samples or pharmacy this late.
When you find a good product, you may never see it again.  Good buys on electronics, if they have what you want.  The wines are no bargain.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x808578e797263f71:0xaaf976e769f9e272<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<date>1525697933310<//date><Review>The intrance clerk who checks the member card needs more training on being polite. They should not be like police. When a costumer says they have it, give them a benefit of doubt. That’s is a simplest thing of costumer service you can do. Don’t pull them to a side and say you are just doing a job. the intrance of all the business houses all over the world welcome their costumers to their best they can but this location treat as if they don’t want anybody come here. The very first and the most important moment of impression that you could have on costumers is not working.
Why do you even check, since you’ll be checking it at check out and the exit anyway.

Parking is a nightmare, and people clog the roads with their carts and kids causing major traffic jams. When leaving the parking lot, often times you'll get stuck behind drivers who can't drive and don't take the opportunity to make a left turn to get out on the main road unless there aren't any cars.

When shopping in store, the same can be said about people. Have fun navigating that cart full of groceries when people aren't aware of their surroundings, or just don't care.

My tip: Try shopping during different parts of the day to find when it's less hectic for you. Avoid rush hour.<//Text>

Everytime i go to there they keep increasing the price
which i don't like about them.Employees at electronic department are not very friendly I just want to buy a tv today and person over there was pretty rude to me and I ended up walk a way from store and about to close my account.
I don't recommend this location to anybody.< /Text>

I know Costco is usually a very busy place. But this one is ridiculous. You can't find parking, the people are rude and you can't shop in peace. There is always some either ramming into you with their cart or just coming to a complete stop in the middle of the isle.< /review>

<Review>This is a super busy Costco.  There is rarely parking.  However it always carries all the things that Concord and Vallejo don't.  Such as more coffees!   And the staff is nice but the customers are pushy and rude.<//Review>< pictures>

43 minute wait for Pizza. Food Staff touch pizza with bare hands once it is fully cooked which in fact is not allowed. Part of food safety. They are allowed to touch before it heads into oven but not after. Staff need training for customer service and to keep comments to themselves. Food Inspection is not properly filled out with date of inspection or if they in fact passed at all. Health department needs to do a surprise visit. Food Safety should be highest priority<//Review>

< review>
The Richmond Costco's is great. The know me by name. When they haven't seen my son in a while they will ask how he's doing. {ROCK, TERRANCE, REST OF THE PEOPLE AT THE DOOR}

The Photo Lab they are great. They do such a great job with my prints. I don't mind if it's a long wait. I'll inform them I will get them later. One time I had stated that I will pick them up later or the next day. They had called me while I was still in the warehouse to inform me my pictures were ready. Why to go Photo Lab.

They Richmond Costco's is great. I've been to the Vallejo and Concord Costco's I won't go back. I'll go to Richmond first. The Concord Costco's I had asked them would they cut my wallet prints for me. There response was "NO" you have to do it yourself. Concord Costco's Photo Lab you lose. Richmond Costco's I can ask them the same would you cut my wallet prints. There response is "YES"  we will cut them for you. If they are busy they would or I will tell them I will wait until you are not so busy. While I am waiting I might help other customers at the Kioski.

Well, when I tried to use my card at another location after this, they told me my card couldn't be used because this location put a block on my card!!!!! I was furious, to say the least. It embarrassed me in front of my friend and other customers for your mistake!! I'm still going to say something the next time I go in..... if I decide to go here again!!!!!</review>< Name>

<Review>This Costco is the only one in the area, and serves many cities. I don't understand why another Costco hasn't been built for this area. Also parking is horrible! And if you're disabled good luck in getting disabled parking.

If you're OK with crowds, considering the member rebate, good pricing on everything from soup to nuts. If shopping for a "specific" model #, you may be disappointed.</Review>

their entrance and exit on different sides, so trying to walk in the wrong door is a big one.

products are placed a lot neater, seems like there are a lot more working display for their electronics.

There are a lot more food varies.

gas lines are shorter.

and this is at a great location because i can go to the dog park right after a quick costco run.<//Text>< response>

Costco needs to open another Warehouse in this area. This store is often packed with frustrated people complaining about how crowded it is.  Also, Costco's marketing strategy that moves products to often vastly different locations in the store exacerbates the overcrowding issue as people are searching throughout the store for their purchases.</Text>

I would not recommend buying tires here.  I ordered online as I had an odd size and they had great prices.  There is no communication on what to do or how to schedule an appointment.  With UPS I could see that the tires were delivered to Costco and when I called the customer service number they said the tire department was not part of CostCo and they could not help me.  They did not even have a number.  So, now I have 4 tires at Costco and no way to schedule installation....  I should have stuck with Big O tires.</Text>

I was told by 3 different people where the frozen vegetables were and then with no frozen vegetables I mentioned it to the checkout guy he act like I wasn't talking to him then I prepaid for some food at the snack bar and the prepaid line had 15 people and in the regular line had three people and it still took me 15 minutes when I stood in the regular line.  They need more people.< /review>

In all of El Cerrito area just we can find this Castco and everything that you think you can find. Me and all of my friend buy everything from this castco. Because it is the best place for purchase and price is very good and place has the biggest parking and very clean area and their employee are very friend with everyone.< /text>

<text>Conveniently off the freeway in the heart of the beginning of the East Bay, this location as people mentioned has parking issues. However, I would say it's not really an issue if you come early.  By early, I do mean 10-11am.  I do see people who park here and go off for a run when I was filling up gas here.

Oh, speaking of which, the Gas tank here is just slightly further down the street and it's usually about 0.20 cheaper than your popular stations. You do have to make an extra turn from the way it's setup but nothing to strange.  Great for me because the Costco Citi card now gives 4% back.

If you come early to do your tires and need to use the restroom, ask the guy in the tire shop nicely and they'll let you use theirs.< /text><time>1473967085171<//time>< Pics>

Great Costco prices.

However the personnel/service at this location is handsdown the WORST I've ever experienced at any Costco location, and I've shopped at a handful.

The personnel here have nasty attitudes, make loud blatant sexual innuendos when checking out (while taking their time to flirth with each other in front of me). It feels as though I owe them money or something.

Ordered a whole combo pizza that was basically half cheese pizza when I opened it. What a joke.

Terrible personnel. Who does the hiring at this location anyways?< /Review>

This is your standard costco. It has a gas station associated, which is great, and everything that you would expect a costco to have. It's incredibly busy most of the time, like other costcos, so it's better to go early in the day or close to closing.<//Review>

Consistently the worst customer service in every department I have had the joy of dealing with including the front end managers. I guess it's so ridiculously busy there's no need to be concerned about your customers. Just when you thought Costco had standards...< /text>

Watch out for the cashier named Ruby. She can be vindictive...She forgot to add thev2 chicken bakes I requested to my check out order and then when I called her on it after I had to leave my space in the long line at the snack bar, she got shirty on me and then proceeded to hand off the ring up to her bagger assistant so she could sneak off into the snack bar kitchen where she had the cooks hand her 2 chicken bakes and then she sliced cuts on them both and spit into them and then they got handed off to me by the snack bar lady. I then complained to the manager and she assured me they would have a word with cashier Ruby.<//text>

<Review>Only one problem. Great place ... But have now had 3 shoppers follow me with their carts too closely! My right heel (in one case) somehow lifted the front of their full & large shopping cart off the ground as it ran into me! Very painful!!!! I told managers twice about these errant shoppers who follow too close. I'm sure I'm not the only one. I suggested they publish a video on their many large screen TVs warning everyone about this. And nothing has been done. This is the only store where this has ever happened to me ... What gives?</Review>< pictures>

I like the selection but I  wish they wouldn't switch up where they have inventory.   It makes it harder to find stuff and the foot traffic is already annoying. I wish it was less crowded.<//review>

The food place after the register is the bomb!! Each season they stock up the isles with seasonal stuff and always have samsung uhd TVs. The dinner rolls in the bakery are something to die for and the samples are UNLIMITED.</Review>

< review>
Ive lived in multiple locations over the past years Palm Desert Eugene Oregon Los Angeles. I've visited costco in each of those cities since I have a Costco membership. I generally experience good customer service of course there's always the crowding that goes along with Belk shopping but that's to be expected. However when I visited the Richmond Costco this morning I was greeted with extreme rudeness at the door.  All of the customer service attendants inside of the store, at the pharmacy and at the merchant counter were very friendly and helpful. However the people checking people in and out at the entrance/exit were extremely rude incompetent in their command of the English language and seemed to be unhappy with their jobs.. Race doesn't have anything to do with this as I am a Latina however I would expect that if you're in customer service you would be able to express yourself in an appropriate and professional manner when dealing with guests.</review>

This Costco is just like any other Costco, only with MANY MORE CUSTOMERS! Their management, and especially the Optomitrist (not necessarily their eye wear department) is WAY above average. Try to avoid the place on weekends. REALIZE that their mark-up ACROSS THE BOARD is a flat 20% (except booze and tires). GREAT prices on electronics and high-end jewelry.
Take careful note of posted prices, as the 'price tags' are coded: ending in .99 is standard mark-up; Price ending in .97 – a deal decided by the manager (read: CLEARANCE) Once it's gone it's gone.
Price ending in .49 or .79 – manufacturer's special
Price ending in .00 — the goods are about to go! Last pallet for example.
Lastly: their Return Policy is as GOOD AS IT GETS, and sometimes the line is as bad as it gets!< /review>

I have always loved Costco ever since I was a kid and we would come to this one. That was way back in the day. When the enterence was facing the hills. And the hotdogs where done on moving carts outside. Damn those where the days. I didn't understand the value of Costco until I got a bit older. But I do enjoy a good old Costco run every once and a while. Seeing as I don't have a big family I don't need to go as often. Lol. But I love going.<//Text>

<text>This Costco is right by the harbor and piers. Basically, it is a oceanside location. This one has a food court, tire service, pharmacy, eyewear, bakery, flowers and hearing assistance. They also process photos and passport pictures. The basics are there food, clothing, alcohol, merchandise, furniture, membership service, etc..< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Better selection than the San Leandro location, as well as a more bearable clientèle. Still, avoid on the weekends if you can — unless you have all the time and patience in the world.<//Review>

The workers aren't too friendly. There employees attitude and interactions with customers are worst  then Walmart in worst of neighborhoods. They have that "what are you gonna do about it" attitude. I purchased multiple bottles of wine and put them in the empty wooden wine crate I found sitting. Paid for all items and waited in line to walk out of the store. When my time came to give the receipt to the door man. He pulled me to the side and made me empty out the box while he watched and started giving me lectures. He made me feel like I just got caught stealing something. Why didn't cashier say anything if there was some kind of store policy on wine boxes???.</Text>

I used to be able to stop by, find what I need, pay for it, and get out in 15 minutes. This place blows in terms of parking. Traffic went from bad to worst. It's gotten too small to serve multiple cities in the immediate area. They need to open a new store.</Text>

I would go here more often if it weren't such a cluster to navigate.  Costco either needs to expand this location (they did as much for the gas station here) or build another store nearby.  The next closest are in Hayward and Concord.

What's worse is that the people at Costco who should be reading these reviews are not reading these reviews.  I have been told by many workers at the various bay area costcos I've been to and they all say the same thing: fill out the comment cards near the exit or you won't get your word out.

So please do this, fellow Costcoian (?).  Find the comment cards.  Fill one out when you go, every time you go.  Mention the crowds and the terrible parking and the desperate need for expansion.  Otherwise nothing will change.<//Text>

Parking is a bigger challenge than it should be due to the crowds and (relatively) small lot. You have to have a membership to shop here (and a general desire to buy things in bulk). Memberships range between $50-$100 but can pay for themselves depending on what you buy and how often you buy it. They do have amenities like a gas station and tire center, a deli and bakery, an eye doctor, a pharmacy (closed on Sunday) and a photo processing department, so you can get a lot done in one place.</review>

I shop at this costco regularly and you pay for the service you get.  With that in mind, I don't take offense with dry attitudes I get from your young female cashiers.
I called the tire shop Saturday to see if I needed an appointment and to get information since this was my 1st time purchasing tires from Costco.  No one ever answered tge phone.
I decided to come in Sunday to check it out.  When I arrived I found great parking , and was able to walk right up to the counter where Chris greeted me.  We reviewed my vehicle and the tire measurments and type I needed.
Chris told me he wouldnt be able to match the same exact tires but he had 2 tires for my car.  Great!  I paid and Chris said it would be 3 hours. Which also makes sense since a line had formed behind me.
I said to Chris before I left everythings good, all season all wheel drive, he said yes.
I forgot to mention 1 last thing about my vehicle and starting it to Chris,  he said no problem they will call you.  He also asked where I parked my car.  I thought it was good, called my Uber and went home.
3 hours later I get a call from Leonard the head mechanic I assume.  He let me know that due to my car being All wheel drive, they could only do all 4 tires since they do not carry that type to match my other 2 tires.  I had the option to purchase 4 tires, but I only need 2.
Leonard was extremely helpful he told me he could get me a refund and apologized.
So another $20 uber ride back to Costco to now pick up my car with no new tires, and hopefully a speedy refund.
I got back to the front desk at costco and there was a woman in front of me and Chris was there to greet me.  Leonard came up and was dealing with a wrong phone number written down from another customer, he took me and skipped the lines and immediately refunded my money!
I went to get my car and realized no one told me where it was parked.  Again went to Chris and he acted like I should know where you all park cars that are ready for pick up, well I dont.
This was my 1st time using the tire shop!  He told me where  my car was after walking up and down the parking lot with an injured knee!

My suggestion after spending $40 on uber and 4 hours of my time to recieve no services is to train Chris on how to identify an issue such as mine before it happens.  If he would've told me the costco tire policies as Leonard did once I had already paid, I wouldnt of left my car here in the 1st place.  Was he trying to push me to buy 4 tires and get it done?  well I'll never know!
In customer service if you notice your wasting someones time and money you wanna take care of them and have sense of urgency.  Leonard knows this, the bad rating is not due to Leomard, tho Chris wasted my money and time!  I will never use costco tires shops and stick to my usual shopping here, and not go back to this location.</text>

Parking here sucks otherwise it is the same as any other Costco basically you go here or San Leandro if you want Costco in Oakland, Berkeley, West CoCo only other option is Concord. Emeryville or Oakland location would be great addition.< /text>

<Text>Costco is always a sure bet. The parking is a little cramped but oftentimes I just park down by the waterfront and walk to the store, the stroll is nice.</Text>< pics>

It's Costco, but avoid this one on the weekends when it's crazy busy (it can be worth driving to Vallejo, Fairfield, or Vacaville just for sanity's sake). Weekdays are fine.< /review>

The problem on weekends from 1 t 4pm is the parking. Omg we have seen soooo many people fighting for parking. The store meets general store standards. The gas station always crowded maximum 15 mins waiting in line to get gas. Carts on the parking lot left everywhere.<//text>

Costco, what more is there to say??

If there were a separate review for parking however, I would not give it a 5-star rating because it can be desperate at times with dog walkers, joggers, and park goers taking up too many parking spots.<//Text>

Horrible parking situation!  This parking lot can't handle the customer load. Horribly rude locals!  Need license's taken away. Be prepared to walk from the back parking lot...

Be prepared to wait in LONG lines but they DO THEIR BEST to get EVERYONE thru quickly.
Some Costco people are "stand-off'ish" bcuz they're OBVIOUSLY ABUSED by the CUSTOMER'S here!
Some customer's need to stop eating lunch at EVERY station and leaving TRASH on the FLOOR!!! SAY THANK YOU once in a WHILE to those poor CDS people!!!
Costco employee's here are AWESOME... Not ONE rude employee.</Review>< rating>

Do not buy costco cash card any costco.
I purchased 12 costco cash cards at Palm Spring Southern California. I gave many my friends the cards.
One of my friends used every amount. and then he throw away the card at this costco.
This Costco called me for the missing cash card . They didn't check the amount.
Following the guide, Finally, I went this service center for checking the cash card.
I wasted time for 2 hours. I was disappionted their service.</text>

<time>1375487364419</time><rating>5< /rating><Review>What can I say, it's a Costco.  Tons of people, no parking, and 5 gallons of mayonaise.  It seems slightly smaller that the Costco in San Leandro.  I've had a bad experience with waiting forever for a pizza there once but it was busy.  I'm not one of those "I'm an entitled consumer so where's my freakin' pizza" shopper.  What's nice is that right behind the gas pumps is a nice trail that goes around Costco to the highway.  I believe that trail can take you all the way to Emeryville.  Take a lot of water because there isn't any shade and that 50lb box of brownie mix can get heavy.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

Usually crowded. Parking lot has narrow lanes and gets jammed often. The warehouse is large, even by Costco standards, and has a huge number of products (though as with any Costco branch, generally one or two options per category, so not much of a selection).<//review>

It's Costco, what else can you say? Probably one of the biggest and most crowded I've ever been to. However it is right on the Bay and near some hike/bike trails and a dog park.</Text>

It's Costco. Its a zoo unless you go early on a weekday. And don't attempt to park near the entrance as you'll be stuck waiting in aline of cars waiting for that one spot. You probably need the exercise anyway.</review>

<text>The problem with Costco is they always have a product until you need it when you go and look for the product that you want it's never in stock and it's not even clear as to where it is in the store they also move things around in this location far too often so one week the fruits will be in one part of the store and then they're moved over to another section the following week it's quite frustrating it quite difficult to make your way around when you're not really sure which direction you should be going and the product that you really want isn't currently being stopped carried at the location</text>< userid>

(Translated by Google) It's always crowded here.
The staff are friendly and the goods are on display.
If it's one flaw, after going through the parking lot
Parking is available.
Where you are refueling, there is an empty space
Often waiting to see what happened
How would you like to be actively guided by the people you work for?

(Original)
여기는  항상 사람들이 붐빈다.
직원들도 친절하고 상품도 잘 진열되어 있어 쇼핑하기좋다
한가지 흠이라면 주차를 여러번 돌아다닌 끝에
주차가능하다는것이다
주유하는곳에선 차에 가리어 주유할수있는 빈공간이
생긴걸 못보고  대기해 있는경우가 종종 있다
근무하시는 분이 적극적으로 안내해주는건 어떨까 싶다 .<//review>

(Translated by Google) It is a very large place with a great selection of all kinds of items, from foods such as red meat, chicken, fish, shrimp and bacon, those are some examples and it has a great diversity of vegetable products but I think avocados and salads of spinach to mention a few examples, and if we talk about toilet paper I really like that of this store, like kitchen napkins because they are very thick and absorbs very well, another department of the store that I like a lot are cookies and its bread, but it has much more like clothes and everything you need for your home at a pretty good price and very good quality in my personal opinion, compared to food maxx, or Smart final and we don't talk about your television sets and video cameras or computers, come to live the experience and finally something that I value very much your payment lines are very efficient and your ATMs very friendly at least every time I go that is my personal experience.

Es un lugar muy grande con una gran selección de todo tipo de artículos, desde alimentos como carnes rojas, pollo, pescado, camarones y tocino, esos son  algunos ejemplos y tiene una gran diversidad de productos vegetales pero a mí parecer los aguacates y las ensaladas de espinacas por mencionar algunos ejemplos, y si hablamos de papel higiénico me agradan mucho el de esta tienda,al igual que las servilletas de cocina porque son muy gruesas y absorbe muy bien, otro departamento de la tienda que me agrada mucho son las galletas y su pan,pero tiene mucho más como ropa y todo lo necesario para tu hogar en un precio bastante bueno y muy buena calidad en mi opinión personal, comparando con food maxx,o Smart final y no hablamos de sus aparatos de televisión y video cámaras o computadoras,ven a vivir la experiencia y por último algo que valoro mucho sus líneas de pago son muy eficientes y sus cajeros muy amables al menos cada vez que voy esa es mi experiencia personal.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Unfortunately we are in a difficult situation where the need for products is very difficult due to the selfishness of unscrupulous people who monopolize without thinking of others especially for people who are out of technology without being able to make use of it.

Lamentablemente estamos en una difícil situación dónde la necesidad de productos está muy difícil dado al egoísmo de personas sin escrúpulos que acaparan sin pensar en los demás especialmente para las personas que están fuera de tecnología sin poder hacer uso atraves de ello

<review>(Translated by Google) A store where you can find everything you need for a balanced daily diet. They have many organic products. You can also find all kinds of products for home, office, travel, parties, etc. It is distinguished from other stores, since you must be a member of the brand to buy in its stores. Magas an annuity with which you are given a card, with which you can get Discounts and promotions. In addition to the prices that you will find there are lower than much of the competition.

Una tienda donde puedes encontrar todo lo necesario para una alimentacion diaria balanceada. Tienen muchos productos organicos.  Tambien puedes encontar todo tipo de productos para el hogar, la oficina, viajar, fiestas, etc. Se distingue de otras tiendas, ya que, para comprar en sus aucursales debes ser miembro de la marca. Magas una anualidad con la cual se te otorga una tarjeta, con la cual puedes Obtener deacuentos y promociones.  Ademas de que los precios que encontraras ahi son mas bajos que mucha de la competencia.< /review>< pictures>
