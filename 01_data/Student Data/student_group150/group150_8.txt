< Review>
I have had the absolute privilege to be a patient of Dr. Paul Lee's for coming up on 7 years.  In fact, he literally saved my life through medical emergency procedures in 2014. Highly skilled, incredibly knowledgeable and always professional, he is also caring and compassionate. Many a times has he patiently and thoroughly answered all of my questions and concerns, but most importantly he makes my health a priority. Thank you Dr. Lee for all you've ever done, and continue to do for me as talented physician and empathetic professional.<//Review>

<Text>I met with Leslie the physician assistant today in their Irvine office and my appointment was quite excellent. She is very patient and a great listener to my complaints which I had several. She then made arrangements without any hesitation to get the necessary tests ordered to see if any of my symptoms can be identified, treated and relieved. The girls at the desk are also all very pleasant and helpful. I did not have to wait long in the office for my appointment and all in all it was a good experience. I can highly recommend this office.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The office staff is polite, friendly and efficient. The Physicians Assistant Leslie Whitney was patient and listened to my symptoms and complaints. She offered the level of service and concern for my symptoms that I have been seeking during the past several months of my illness. I feel confident that we are now making progress.</review>

<Review>Was in a lot of pain in my stomach & throat and needed to see a Gastroenterologist doctor ASAP.  The doctors were all out of the office but said I could come in and speak with the PA (Leslie) that afternoon. They are wonderful here Leslie listens to all my complaints of the symptoms I was having and put the steps into motion for getting me and Endoscopy the following week with Dr. Oman this was the soonest possible appointment. I hope all goes well with this as it is still a few days before my Endoscopy procedure. I am very impressed with this office so far and their willingness to go the extra mile to help a new patient they had never seen before. I will update this review after my procedure but I feel very confident that I am in good hands.< /Review>< Pictures>

<response>None</response><Text>This place is a greedy money machine where patient is the last priority. The only thing that went well with me here is my procedure, and they collect the money for it beforehand by the way! After the procedure, things went downhill. I was told the biopsy results should be back within 10 days and the doctor will call me to discuss the results. After 10 days I gave them a call and asked about the results they told me it didn't come back yet. I tried to schedule a follow-up with the doctor the did the procedure (Dr. Bemanian), they told me the earliest appointment is 2 months away, WTH! After hitting the 20 days mark after the procedure without receiving the biopsy results, I tried calling them again, leaving voicemails, messages, nothing works. No response at all! I decided to go in person to the office. I went there and asked the receptionist about the results, only to find that the results have been sitting there for 10 DAYS without being reviewed, without being added to the patient portal, and without anyone calling me or even answering my calls. That's how much they care about their patients! The doctors there are just too busy doing procedures (which they try to upsell to you just like a salesman!) because that's what brings a lot of money to the clinic. The money they get from office appointments is just peanuts compared to the procedures.< /Text><pics>None</pics><name>Ahmed M Hassan<//name>< Rating>

Some not so good. Yesterday was my second screening with Dr. Yu. He is excellent. I plan to use him for the rest of my life in my quest to avoid dying from the disease that killed my father. The support staff at HOAG Endoscopy Center is also outstanding. They are courteous and professional from the moment you walk through the door to the moment you leave.

< review>
The office of the digestive disease consultant my doctor B Office is very clean social distancing they take your temperature they ask you these questions which is reasonable .
They are very helpful very nice , Very respectful during this trying time.
Dr. B he’s fantastic he’s my superhero he gives you the time to explain what is going on what’s happening and which I like because I love a doctor that straightforward and tells you what it is I hate it when they go around the circle  It makes you feel like they’re hiding something or not telling you everything makes you worry more but my doctor does not do that. If you were looking for a good gastrologist I would suggest this office and talk with Dr. B as I said before he save my life more than once.</review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Dr. Lee was very professional and came to talk with me after the endoscopy. He explained the procedure and initial findings well. The only disappointment was I had scheduled the procedure for a certain time a month in advance to fit in my schedule and the Friday before my procedure, which was Monday, I got a call informing me they had changed the time. I was informed that if I wanted to continue with the procedure I would have to do it at the changed time or not do it at all. I did not appreciate the last minute notice and it seemed that did not respect my time or my wishes.< /Review><time>1608226784259< /time></record></dataset><record>

I had my first ever colonoscopy and an endoscopy with Dr. Bemanian. Everyone from reception/check in to the nurses and the doctor himself were knowledgeable, caring and nice. Must mention that the receptionist is so warm and cheerful that I believe her energy could light the entire city of New York. The procedure (s) was easy and over before I knew it with no discomfort whatsoever afterward. Dr. Bemanian has a great bedside manner and was very thorough in his explaining everything. I have already recommended him to my husband and won't hesitate to recommend him and this practice to others.< /Review>

All was done  in and unhurried professional way.    I felt that everyone listened to me when I had a question  that seemed to me out of the norm they did give me a thoughtful solution.   I went away  with a feeling  of  confidence  that all would  go well and  I  know these are  trying  times so I am thankful.<//Text>

Very efficient from the beginning to the end! Unlike others, the bowel prep kit was easy and effective. The procedure itself was only approx. 10min or so. The complete report was ready when I was discharged.</text>

A colonoscopy is never a pleasant experience.  However, Dr. Bemanian and all of the staff who took care of me before, during, and after the procedure helped to make it comfortable and anxiety-free.  I felt that I was in the hands of very competent and experienced people.< /Review>

I've only had 1 appointment but so far I am very pleased. I have been experiencing severe abdominal pain and issues since 2016, have seen 5 doctors who haven't taken it seriously. I saw Leslie for 20 minutes, she listened to my symptoms and ordered testing. Every staff member I've spoken to so far is extremely polite.</text>

This was my first appointment with Dr. Hwang. I appreciated how her and her associate took genuine interest in first trying to get to know and understand what I have been dealing with. Also how Dr. Hwang took the time to listen to and thoroughly address all of the questions and/or concerns I had. Her responses/feedback made me feel confident that I will be in good hands! Additionally, I like the fact that we were able to wrap up the conversation with a road map in place, so that I know exactly what the next steps will be.</review>

<username>Bethany Justice< /username><Text>I'm an RN that works with Dr Yu from time to time, when I have patients on the unit who need his care, and he's fantastic. But, now, as a patient, I think he's just genuinely an awesome guy. He's honest and ensures you feel comfortable before, throughout (I'm sure), and after the procedure. The anesthesiologists are great, and special shoutout to all the nurses working under him, who hold up such great quality care. Dr Yu explained my results clearly, and his office is great with follow-up calls.< /Text>< Rate>

MY APPOINTMENT WAS HANDLED EFFICIENTLY.  JOANA WHO GREETED ME AND TOOK MY VITALS AND ESCORTED ME TO THE WAITING ROOM WAS PLEASANTAND COMPLIMENTARY.  AFTER ABOUT A 10 MINUTE WAIT,  RICHARD, THE NURSE PRACTIONER, CAME IN TO DISCUSS MY ISSUES,  MY MEDICAL HISTORY, ETC.  HE TOOK NOTES.  HE, TOO,  WAS VERY PLEASANT AND EASY TO TALK TO.  NO DOUBT DR HWANG IS RELYING ON BOTH OF THESE PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES TO PROVIDE HER WITH THE INFORMATION, SO SHE CAN PROPERLY  DIAGNOSE MY PROBLEM AND COME UP WITH A SOLUTION.  I LOOK FORWARD TO MY NEXT VISIT.< /Text>

Dr. Yu continues to amaze me with his knowledge, care and kindness for my elderly mother. He goes above and beyond as far as I am concerned. He is the only Doctor that I want my mother to see.< /Text>

Extremely rude staff!!! I returned a missed call from office and the lady who picked up flat out told me that I couldn't help because I called at 4:59. FYI, I got the call at 4:57. I understand that since they close at 5pm but what came after that is what makes me so mad. I told her that I was out of med and asked whether there was a way to get a refill  - and she said no and that I had to wait until January until the person in-charge might or might not come. That what she said, 'don't know when' and kept repeating that so rudely without any explanation. So, I have no med, no way to get a refill, and no idea when to get a refill... I've never been so poorly treated by a medical office in my life. All I asked was for some kind of help/solution to my Rx refill - yet she had to make it so painfully difficult. Just to clear, Dr. Yu is a good doctor - his staff, at least the one who dismissed today, is definitely not. Having power doesn't mean you can abuse it...<//Text>

I'm very satisfied with Dr. Lee's treatment. I think he is very capable doctor. He explains everything in detail what I asked and is also very kind. All staffs in his office are very courteous and kind as well. I'd like to recommend Dr. Lee gladly to anybody.

Thank you.<//Text>

I don't know which doctor the previous reviewer saw, but I saw Dr. Bemanian and he is fantastic.  His bedside manner is so warm and kind.  He put me at ease immediately, he was funny and engaging.  He took all the time I needed to answer all my questions.  The front office staff and procedure scheduler were all very polite and professional.< /Review>

<Text>This is the worst medical office I dealt with through my whole life. After my procedure is done, I will never come back. I saw Dr Singh who was very knowledgeable and made a good impression . I had issues with heartburn, abdominal cramps and difficulties swallowing. The doctor prescribed me a medication, which turned out to be needing a prior authorization. It was prescribed in the middle of July, but the authorization department of this office failed to submit proper paperwork for insurance until end of August. I called multiple times, left many messages, which were not even recorded in their computer system, so nobody had a clue why I kept calling. At the end of August I spoke to the person from authorization department, who informed me that "she is very busy and it will take weeks". At this point my heartburn started to get worse and I was choking on food. I went to see my primary MD, who got the medication approved in 2 days. My heartburn was getting so bad that I had to go to ER. I begged the office to schedule my procedure sooner, but it did not happen. Within a week from procedure, I realized that did not get any information/paper work about the procedure from the office. I also called the surgery center, who told me that I am not on the schedule, and Dr Singh is not planning to be there on that particular date. I got worried and called office again. I talked to Yvette, who reassured me that the paperwork for my surgery was sent to Surgery Center awhile ago, but she will resend paper work the same day. I called Surgery Center the following day. They still did not have me on the schedule. I spoke to the manager, who said that they finally JUST received required paperwork from GI office. She also told me that the paperwork was not sent before, so Yvette lied, when she told me that it was sent awhile ago. So four days before the surgery GI office sent the required paperwork, probably just because I called them. Since things have been constantly screwed by this office, I decided to get a prep for my colonoscopy in advance. It turned out that this particular prep was not covered by my insurance and I had to pay $126. I had to make another phone call.  And I still did not have any instructions from GI office. They sent me email to confirm my procedure, but the link did not work. I have never had to deal with such level of unprofessionalism and uncaring attitude. The whole experience was incredibly stressful and frustrating. The only person who was helpful in the office was Max. Doctors might be good, but the office staff is awful.    Don't go to this office !!!</Text>< gmapID>

The girls at the front are nice, that's about it with this place. First of all, it is so hard to get people to call you back. Left numerous messages to make an appointment. It's been 2 weeks and called 5 times. The girl who schedules the appointment is rude and should find another job.<//review>

My first encounter with this practice was when I was in the hospital, in 2013, with a perforated colon (which I could have died from but my original gastroenterologist failed to tell me that). That original gastroenterologist came to my room, introduced me to one of the three doctors in this practice (which after this many years, I don't remember which one), and announce he was leaving the country for several weeks and they would take care of me. And they did. After being in the hospital for about 2+ weeks, the decision I had to make was to have immediate surgery which would incur a colostomy bag, or try to wait as long as possible to let the area heal up a bit first. Dr. Yu recommended that I wait, while the surgeon wanted to go in and cut right then. I decided to go home on IVs and wait, and the fact that I did made a huge difference when I ultimately went in for surgery about a month later.  I didn't have to have the colostomy bag after having the colectomy (resection)! Since then I have seen Dr. Bemanian a couple of times for appointments, and he is very personable and seems to listen. I now have an endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled with Dr. Lee, so if there is an update to this I will post later. I have every confidence with this group. Phone calls are usually returned fairly promptly, although getting scheduled for a procedure might be a bit slow, for which I took off one star. Don't think you can do too much better than this group to be honest. My original gastro never followed up on my 2 stays in the hospital within 3+ months, but his office called me a year later to schedule a colonoscopy. When I told them I was with another group because of his non follow-up, he never called to discuss it with me. Guess he didn't need my business!<//text>

<text>My father was admitted to Hoag Irvine with a stricture.  I never knew the name of the doctor who performed a endoscopy and balloon dilation until  we received his bill.  I asked several times to speak to the Dr (Bemanian) to understand the procedure and to also discuss possible other better procedures, such as a stent.  As it turned out, my deaf 98 year old Dad is stuck on a feeding tube nightmare because the dilation did not work  Not once did this Dr. consult with my family.  There were many mistakes made with no discussions about other, more options could have used, throughout our stay at Hoag.  But, the nightmare we are still living started with Dr. Bemanian's lack of contact.  Stay away...and question everything...don't sign anything until you are sure you have ALL the information.  We are seeing another gastro dr. today...pray for my Dad to get off this horrible feeding tube.  Sometimes, it should be considered by drs that just because you CAN do a procedure doesn't mean you should.< /text><name>Suzette Irvine</name></record></dataset><record>

I felt so uncomfortable with my physician. His lack of empathy and robotic demeanor was just unsettling and uncomfortable and I wouldn't go back there. There are plenty of places that have much kinder doctors, this just wasn't the right place for me but YMMV.<//text>

<Review>Cho from Joy Laundry has been incredibly friendly and helpful with their pick-up and drop-off services, and everything I give them to clean including bedding, clothes, and uniform items always come back the cleanest they’ve ever been, every time. I have never been disappointed by their service!< /Review><Name>Noah Greene</Name>< Rating>

This is a great laundromat in a bad location. If they were in Yuba City they would be the most popular laundromat in town. They have good washers and dryersand great service from the family that owns it. I would definitely recommend this place if your close to it.<//text>

Best place in yuba county to do your laundry. Good machines to use and great service  available for laundry services drop your laundry off and let them clean this service is pay by pound. Still nice to know they have that type of service. Brent Stephens<//review>

Definitely the BEST laundromat in the marysville/ yuba city area. Its honestly the best laundromat I've ever visited. I've been super skeptical about trying a public laundromat, as I've always had my own personal washer and dryer. However, Joys Laundry gave me more than enough reassurance. Their facility is CLEAN! The owner is attentive to the environment and does his best to keep the place clean, safe and orderly. The washers are SO CLEAN! Prices are fair and dryers work well. Their washers are even touch screen and they have an atm, change machine, popping music playing, snacks, soaps vending, some kids entertainment and even TV's. This laundromat is awesome. I'll never look for another again. Thanks Joy's!! You guys rocked it with this laundromat. Keep it up, it's awesome :)< /Text>

Good machines, well kept facility; unfortunately many of the customers did have masks on which detracted from the experience.< /review>

Everyone is always super friendly and nice except the old lady. She hates children and always watches people like they are going to steal things. She always yells at the nice husband because he is so helpful. She and she also makes the place bad. They should keep her away from the business. She is always rude to people.</review>

Had to do some oversized bedding but wasnt sure where to go. I was pressed for time and looking for something close. So, we rolled the dice on this one, and thankfully it turned out to be a very nice place. The owner or manager was very pleasant and helpful. Prices for single serving detergents and fabric softeners were not bad at all.  Clean environment and descent selection of machines available to use. They also offer laundering services for what I thought was a pretty good price.< /review>

Looks just like the pictures posted in the other reviews. I liked that it was clean, had an ATM inside as well as a change machine. The ATM machine said it took an EBT card; I thought that was for food stamps only, but if you can use the funds for laundry too that's awesome. My only complaint is that there aren't enough folding tables on the East side of the room.< /Text>

Best laundry mat in town. Its always so clean and the atmosphere is comfortable. The people are always really nice, and they have great incentives for the customers. The machines are also a decent price, not too expensive. Even if the machine were expensive I would still use this location over any othe locations in the area :]< /review>

Such a great little supermarket!  They have an amazing meat section with the best chorizo I have ever purchased.  They also make an amazing in house salsa that must fly off the shelf, bc it is hit or miss it will be there each week they make it.  They also have a deli in the meat section that makes HUGE deli sandwiches for around $6.  They have everything you could need from a supermarket.  In the same shopping plaza there is a bank, tiny craft store (upstairs) and a gift shop next to market.  All located next to the post office.< /review>

This is a great little town grocery store. It lacks in the produce section, but excels in the butcher shop! Prices are better than across the street, but high in comparison to larger cities. That is to be expected when up the coast. Staff is friendly and efficient.< /text>

<Text>First time I went here with someone, and the inside was nice and fair prices. But, after being inside for several seconds, one cashier just left his post leaving the customer to go to another customer to tell him to put on a mask or he had to leave pointing to the exit. It may have not sounded negative, but he could have not stated "or have to leave" part or making a gesture. I get there is a COVID, but could have been handled better.</Text><Date>1588139328257< /Date><user_name>Alex Wolk</user_name>< pics>

<Text>Medium size grocery store with pretty much everything one may need.  I felt it was a little pricier than normal. There is an upstairs area with basic household stuff, which was great because we needed a ruler. A very handy store given its location.  The lady at the checkout was particularly friendly to talk to.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

Stopped in to replenish vegetables on a trip up the coast. Found good quality produce at good prices, some even on sale at better prices. Looking through the other aisles I felt as though I had gone back in time  finding Alberto VO5 hair dressing for men. What an amazing mix.< /review>

<review>If it is your first visit take your time. Ask a staff member to help you to locate stuff. Most importantly don't get frustrated if they do not have what you are looking for (check out the 2nd floor for cookware school supplies etc.)<//review>< Rating>

Quaint small town market that is surprisingly full.  Whomever planned the store did a fine job of utilizing every available square inch of space. The meat counter, although small, carries a better than decent selection.< /text>

<response>None< /response><Review>Cheap gas and a Good Location. This Arco has both. Lots of gas pumps and a car wash, this station  has at least 2 clerks on duty always so waits are short at the counter. Many food offerings from hot food, snacks, sodas, chips and beer. Their slogan,      "To much good stuff! " appears to be very accurate.< /Review>< pictures>

Good gas price.  I believe I paid $2.51 for 87. Not bad, being that I'm from the bay area as that price simply doesn't exist here.</review>

This place is always consistently fast and the staff is consistently friendly.  My only gripe this time was that the coke Icee machine was not in proper order it took a very long time to fill the cup. I had to keep stop and going on it and it's not like the red light was on for 'do not use'.... it just took a really long time to fill the cup. It's like it needed breaks or something.... it was weird. Then when brought it to the attention of a staff member they kind of shrugged it off and said yea that machine kinda has problems.....um. okay. So....fix it?< /Text>

<text>Simply the best place to go to indulge your sweet tooth regardless of your regulations. They have speciality desserts for everyone from decadent dark chocolate to their vegan passion fruit. Gluten free, minis, small nibbles they have it all in a quiet corner hidden away.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Hands down best gluten free cakes/desserts you can find in LA.

I am not gluten free either, my wife is, but I cannot tell the cakes are gluten free. Which is why they are the main choice because it satisfies everyone's needs.

I was first nervous to spend a premium for their cakes, they are expensive, but they serve a lot of people or just last longer for us. After our first vanilla with fruit gf cake, we order pretty much a cake for every special occasion. We were impressed with the quality of the cakes and the care that went into making them. Great bakers.

You must place your order in advance but they are on time and always give you what you ask for.

We have tried most of their gluten free cakes, as you can tell from the pictures. Here is our recommendation in order of our favorites but even the last one is good.

gluten free vegan vanilla cinnamon cake
gluten free vanilla vanilla cake with berries
gluten free dairy free coconut meringue cake
gluten free red velvet cake
gluten free carrot cake
gluten free lemon dream cake

Lots of good desserts as well.

Came for the gluten free desserts. Stayed for the gluten free paninis! Everything is made in house and the chips are to die for! Never had anything like them.<//text>

<review>I just left the shop and ate a tres leeches cake. Omg it was heavenly. My husband and daughter loved their mini and large cupcakes. I didn't try it yet. Mine is in the box but they look delightful. The woman that helped me choose my cupcakes was so sweet and helpful. Please try this place out I promise you won't regret it.<//review></record>

Incredible! Such friendly staff and amazing AMAZING food.

I not only have a gluten allergy, a dairy allergy, egg allergy but also a CORN allergy and they have gone out of their way to look at ingredients for ALL of their products to find what I can eat.

The desserts are so delicious that when I first had them I was terrified they were mistaken that it was safe for me to eat - I thought there was no way something could taste THAT GOOD without gluten diary eggs or corn but I was wrong ( happily wrong ). I am officially a life long customer and addicted to their desserts!

My boyfriend who has No Food allergies and is a foodie has loved everything he has ordered as well ( from sinners and saints list)< /review>

Simply the best bakery I have ever been to. Their "normal" desserts are incredible. Their gluten-free ones taste and feel exactly like the non-gf stuff. I bought a bunch of their cupcakes yesterday for a birthday party and everyone raved about the texture. Their icing is soft and delicious, the pies are incredible. Go here. Often.</Text>

Big, clean, and full of saturated fat goodness! All I can say is: GET THE BANANA PUDDING! I mean, there is nothing better than that. It's pudding and wafer/cake all mixed together. It's so cracked out...in a good way<//Review>

<Text>They have some good desserts but the lady who owns this place makes people uncomfortable and so does her husband. They constantly hire and let go of people, not a single person on staff has anything good to say about working here.
A bit ago they ordered a broom stick and other groceries through instacart and when my gf arrived to drop them off the owner suggested my gf help by sweeping the kitchen while she's there.
Nothing truly special here worth trying to find parking for.<//Text><username>Mrbigdog 213</username>< Rating>

The lemon filling mini cup cake is the best! The lemon bar is good too.  Very fresh and tasty.
They provide great variety of gluten free cup cakes. It is a little be pricey  but still worth to try.</Text>

My friend ordered a gluten free, vegan cake from here and I was bracing myself for a less than gratifying taste, but I was so pleasantly surprised! It was actually one of the best cakes I've ever had! The strawberry shortcake is heavenly! You need to order well in advance though!</review>

I'm trying to get a birthday cake foe my boyfriend and I read great reviews so I tried again days later and called the place but all they have is an automatic message and no one to pick up the phone so there's no way of contacting the store.

<text>Wow!  Outrageous on all counts!  Stopped in for some GF treats to bring to a dinner party.  Was enticed by the salty brunch items!  Glad I was - what started as a 1/2 sandwich turned into a whole.  Hours later I’m enjoying a cup of coffee and few bites of bread pudding.  Totally worth the first 12 days if 2020 dieting! You guys are the bomb!</text>< pictures>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>5</Rating><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>So happy I found this place. We needed a bit of sugar in the afternoon. They have vegan/gluten-free - not our thing. Give us the sinners. My favorite was the lemon blueberry tartlet. SO tart! The regular cupcakes were nice, but not anything out of the ordinary. The little tarts are where to spend your time. If you want to drink your coffee or tea there, ask for a side of ice. Hottest ever. She warns you, but you'll wait a long time for it to cool down.< /text>< time>

There is a wide selection to choose from. I haven't had Tres Leches Cake in forever because it's not something I would bake at home therefore it was a nice surprise to have it here. I shared it with L who isn't gluten free and is usually reluctant to have gf desserts. She said it was better than a lot of the regular Tres Leches Cakes she's had. I loved it and will come back with my kid who is unfortunately unable to have white rice flour too, but there are still a few options for her here too.< /Text><Date>1582651937739</Date><resp>None< /resp><Rating>5< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

Perfect location to take a break. It serves delicious small chocolate cakes without gluten and coffee.
The cakes aren’t too sweet. And it’s perfect for the body.</Text>

Deserts for every diet but I went for thr huge array of vegan and gluten free options. Sampled half of it and everything was yummy. The cinnamon roll cupcake was my favorite because it simply tasted like an extremely delicious standard cupcake and if you've every been on the hunt for gluten free desserts that taste like they're not gluten free its tough! I could not tell it was gf and it was so soft and fluffy and tasty. I'll be back!< /text>

Elisa & her team are amazing -- the quaint ambience, the caring customer service, creative & delicious desserts make Sinners&Saints a rare gem indeed! I make it a point to visit & load-up on their delectable treats -- even if you're not in the area, it'll be worth the trip to stop by here for their extraordinary desserts :-)<//review>

I've tried several of their desserts and each time I am more in heaven!

Cupcakes, moist and amazing....the chocolate tarts totally divine especially with the flakes of sea salt on top. There are a ton of gluten free and vegan options which is awesome!

Great place, get hungry and go!</review>

I work down the street and never heard of Sinners & Saints.

Their desserts are amazing! I really enjoyed the gluten free red velvet and the bread pudding. I love that they have gluten free and vegan options as well.

The ladies here are all super sweet!<//Text>

Armen at Sinners & Saints Desserts is truly a pleasure to work with. I showed him exactly what I wanted for my daughters birthday, and he truly delivered. He recommended two of their popular flavors, the chocolate ganache and the strawberry shortcake, and they were a hit. Thanks again.<//review>

Great pastries but do not recommend people with celiac disease.  And the gluten free pastries are not 100% gluten free. They have me going to the hospital for having their pastries.  I don't recommend this place to people that have serious health issues.<//text>

Can you say awesome gluten free desserts!? Stumbled upon this little gem and found my go to for awesome GF desserts in LA. Fun little place that asks if you are a sinner (full on wheat!) or a saint (gluten free baby!)..or even a little bit of both.  Had the gluten free (saint) marzipan cake...oh man, yum!! Ended up leaving with GF tiramisu, and some brownies. They also have cookies, brownies, truffles and cupcakes as well as cakes. Both gluten free and non-gluten free options galore.  The owner's were extremely friendly and very helpful. Highly recommend trying this place out!< /Review>

<text>Sinners and Saints Desserts are the 1 stop shop for you, your gluten free, dairy free dessert needs! And  they have gluten and dairy desserts for those who can have that! Both are mouthwateringly delish. You want cookies, they have them. Cakes, tarts, tres leches, tiramisu! Take the cinnamon Bread and make French Toast or bread pudding. The staff is so knowledgeable and friendly, its so fun to get treats there!!</text>< gmapID>

Best bakery in town... they cater to almost everyone! Our last several birthday cakes (Tres Leches & Vanilla withStrawberries) have been from here and NO ONE could tell they were eating gluten free cake! In fact... everyone kept asking who made the cake they loved it so much!

Brilliant concept -
Any items labeled “Sinner” is delicious, naughty goodness

Any items labeled “Saint” is either Gluten free, vegan or both! How cool is that?

They were giving out samples of their savory menu - yum. Sandwiches, salads & sides all with the same Saint or Sinner labeling system. Every item was the bomb! We are for sure coming back for lunch soon.

Here’s what we bought... yes we may have gone overboard ALL GLUTEN FREE:

Focaccia bread to make sandwiches
Cheddar cheese scones
Cinnamon vanilla cupcake
Almond Strawberry cupcake
Biscotti
Chocolate chip cookie
Oatmeal raisin cookie
M&M cookie
Peanut butter cookie sandwiches
Chocolate peanut butter cookie
Chocolate cherry brownie
Tres Leches cake

Again, we may have gone overboard but it’s SO RARE to be able to get gluten free desserts that don’t taste like it.

Everyone would be happy at Sinners & Saints! It’s a must try!< /Review>

Such yummy treats!  Maple-espresso eclair, salted caramel chocolate hearts, coconut macaroons, peanut-butter cookies, cupcakes, flourless chocolate cake... all so good.  This "dessert-ery" has several gluten-free options too and I couldn't tell the difference.  All so tasty!</text>

<Review>Jesus take the wheel! This place is amazing. We were "saints" and went gluten free all the way. Tried the Nutella creme brulee, vanilla creme brûlée, flourless chocolate cake, and tres leches cake. If I had to pick a winner; it'd be the tres leches cake, but honestly, the other three were close seconds. Will come back here the next time we are looking for a sweet treat.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<review>Sinners and Saints is a small, tucked away gem that is not to be missed. The desserts are amazing - we had the salted caramel tart and the nutella cannoli, YUM.  Their gluten free desserts (I'm usually not a fan of gluten free) are tasty too.  The owner was so personable and friendly. Will definitely return many times.  PS they are open 7 days a week.</review>< Pictures>

I came in here for the first time today and the lady working there was super friendly and gave me a sample of a paleo dessert.  It isn't easy finding good paleo desserts but I think I found my new spot.  Thanks.</Text>

<Text>one of my favorite dessert spots on the west side.  i like going there to pick up one of everything to bring as a dessert platter for a dinner i have to attend.  it always goes over so well with all the guests.

my personal favorite is the NUTELLA CREME BRULEE.  everything else i've tried has been amazing too.  and they are super friendly and accommodating.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Elise makes some of the best gluten free desserts I have ever tasted! The tres leches is a stand out but the cupcakes are amazing. The Nutella creme brûlée is delicious. This woman is a baking genius! These treats are so good it's hard to believe they are GF.</Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>I was craving a creme brulee and Sinners and Saints was walking distance from my work (Hallelujah!). It's a bit of a hole in the wall, so it's kinda hard to miss. The baked goods here were bit pricey... $4 for a cream puff?! But their mini creme brulee (what I came for anyways) was only $1.50. Woot woot. Not the best I've ever had but it satisfied my craving.< /Review>< UserId.>

< review>
Located on Lincoln Blvd., between Washington and Venice Blvd. is a slightly hidden shop between all the others that line the street, but at first glance of their display case, your eyes will widen and your salivary glands go into overdrive. *Hint- all desserts labeled as a “Saint” are gluten-free, and can either be low in sugar or fats; and also offer Paleo diet, and Vegan options.

Cannoli- Filled with peanut butter and strawberry jam, then topped with chopped pistachio nuts. Man, oh man, did it ever feel like the better parts of my chubby childhood brought back into the present when I took my first bite into this lip smacking cannoli. Good thing I’ve developed somewhat of a bit of self control, or else I would’ve annihilated the whole lot of these.

Red Velvet Cupcakes-Yes, I know. What’s the big deal with red velvet, EVERYBODY’S got it on their menus, right? Well, in their case, however it is that their recipe is  modified, it’s working. The batter itself is lighter, crumbles beautifully, and its moisture content is higher than the other red velvets I’ve tried anywhere else. Also, paired with the creamiest frosting that is so on point, my fat ass was ready to buy it on the side like a junkie wanting to score a fix.

Bourbon Croissant Bread Pudding- Warm and fresh out of the oven. Amazing flavor with the diced apples and cinnamon infused within as if an apple strudel and a bruleéd French toast had a drunken threesome with a rich and buttery croissant, then nine months later this bread pudding was born. I must have it again.

Gluten Free Blackberry Goat Cheese Cheesecake – As soon as I read the description, I had to try it. It seemed like this particular cheesecake was specifically made for my sister. It is rich and decadent in flavors, without worry of it affecting your health. The tartness of the berries is balanced out by the sweetened, creaminess of the goat cheese. You definitely get hypnotized by swirls of the blackberry infusion within the cake itself. Well worth trying at least once in your life… or twice.

Gluten Free Caramel Cheesecake – A soft and crumbly crust that is covered with a thick, insanely good cheesecake topped with Dulce de Leche, or caramel sauce for you non-food speaking adventurers. It is also garnished with hefty pieces of peanut brittle putting other candy/dessert shops to shame. I tried to pace myself eating this beauty so it would last me for at least two days..Was gone by the end of the first night.< /review>

(Translated by Google) When I went on Saturday afternoon, there was a little line
I ate chocolate chip cookie/cream puff/ and blueberry tart, but the chocolate chip cookie is the best I've ever had!!! It was so moist and had a lot of chocolate chips on it~ The blueberry tart was delicious, but it has a light feeling, so I think people who don't like sweets will like it.
As for the chocolate chip cookie, Bens Cookie, which has branches in Garosu-gil or Gwanghwamun in Korea, has been the No. 1 in my mind so far, but this is No. 1 from today~~~

토요일 오후에 갔을때 줄을 조금 섰어용
초코칩 쿠키/크림퍼프/ 그리고 블루베리 타르트 먹었는데 초코칩 쿠키가 정말 제가 먹어본 것 중 최고!!! 완전 촉촉하고 초코칩도 완전 많이 박혀있었어요~ 블루베리 타르트는 맛은 있었는데 담백한 느낌이라서 너무 단거 안좋아하는 분들이 좋아할것같아욤
초코칩 쿠키는 한국에 가로수길이나 광화문에 지점이 있는 벤스쿠키가 지금까지 내 맘속 1등이었는데 여기가 오늘부터 1등~~~< /text>

Generous and fresh toppings...like the fact there isn't much crust. Wish the sauce was a little different....kind of acidity.<//Review>

<Text>I wish they'd bake the whole wheat crust more and make it thinner (which would make it bake faster). It would be a much better pizza. They are extremely resistant to suggestions about improving the product. Too bad. They should listen to customers more.< /Text>< Pics>

<review>They make a great pizza for a good price. Pizzas come loaded with toppings, and they are large and impossible to finish in one sitting. When there is chicken as a topping, you're getting a good portion of a whole chicken, not just a couple of cubes here and there. Some of the negative comments are totally outdated, staff has turned over many times since.<//review><user>116500733910320017171</user>< response>

My go-to pizza delivery.  My favorite is getting pesto and tomato sauce on a wheat crust! Their twisted sticks are super yummy as well.  I also like how if you eat there you have lots of options for personal meals.< /review>

Got huge cheese pizza with Groupon coupon. Had wheat crust (lower carb + fiber & thinner crust).  Tasted great with extra parmesan cheese, oregano & red pepper flakes + 2 toppings (sausage & artichokes).  Yum!< /text>

<Time>1383798067438<//Time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>I ordered a pizza on a sunday night was told it would be a 45 minute wait, which is okay but not exactly fast. After an hour I get a call telling me it would be another 15 minutes. At this point I'm starting to get a bit impatient but at least they're letting me know. After another 40 minutes of no pizza I call in asking WTF happened to my pizza. All I hear is a bunch of excuses about how they're busy, like I even care. All I want is my pizza I've been waiting on for over an hour and a half. Finally, some guy shows up 2 hours after I put in my order. I ask if I can get a discount, some coupons, anything to make up for this ridiculously late pizza. The delivery guy can't do anything, which is understandable, and he has me call his manager. Manager also can't do anything, apparently no one has any authority to do anything in this place. Best they can do is email corporate and tell them to email me a gift card. And what do you know, the gift card never shows up in my inbox. Big surprise. The pizza gets them one star because it wasn't terrible. Overall, so-so pizza and the worst pizza delivery service I have ever experienced in my life.<//review>< Pics>

<text>Order a calzone add sausage and a Greek salad on Sunday . It was the most disgusting thing I have ever eaten. No sauce, no cheese, tasted like raw garlic and onions. The lettuce in the salad was wilted and old. Could tell they must be pre-made and sitting in a cooler. Tried to eat it since it took so long to arrive but after stomaching 2 bites decided to trash it and take the monetary loss and order from somewhere else. Do not order from the terrible place. The nasty taste lingered in my mouth for hours.  YUCK!!</text>< Pictures>

<review>Ordered a delivery on a Tuesday night more than thirty minutes before their closing time.  They call me after they have already closed and tell me they were "behind" and didn't feel like doing another delivery order.  They say they were going to call me and tell me to pick it up, but then just decided not to make the order and close early.  ?????? No apology or nothing. Nothing like "oh we're sorry, won't happen again! next time you order, free appetizer!"  Nothing.  instead just, hey we didn't feel like it... too bad for you.  How lazy and disrespectful of the customer.  I've worked seven years in the food industry and have never seen such lazy restauranting.  If a customer got an order in one minute before closing, it didn't matter, we made it and served..  You will always be 'behind' when you are too lazy to even fill orders and cant find the will to do your job. They should call it "Maybe Pizza' instead of "Extreme Pizza"<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Rate>

Paige was an incredible guide for us for the wine and chocolate tasting. She was so positive and friendly and gave us recommendations on what else to do in the area. Fantastic experience and Paige made the experience truly great. Such delicious wine and chocolate!<//text>

<text>Looks pretty, great reviews. Stopped in with many bags from the excellent Oxbow Market across the street.  Went in and asked for a tasting, were asked to wait outside, waited in the sidewalk 10 minutes or so and only one of the two women working inside came out.  She brought the tasting sign we were waiting next to inside and didn’t come back out. Waited another few in surprise and went to another tasting room.  Bummer!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

A fun patio experience. We went on a "roadtrip" down the California coast to try several of the Walt wines. Noirs and Chardonnays with unique personalities.<//review>

We had a great visit and the wine is incredible.  We joined their club for their wide selection of pinot noirs.  The host Patti is not only fun but an expert, she made our visit the best wine tasting experience I've ever had.  We look forward to our next trip to Napa!<//Text>

The place wasn't busy this time of day, but it was early. I imagine it's packed most evenings as its clean and nice. We will be back.

Good times.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8085066432c0f07b:0x6c49bf4bfa8356db<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Awesome new, modern tasting room. The tasting experience is focused mainly on Walt Chardonnays and Pinot Noir. You will taste wines from a variety of appellations including Willamette Valley, Oregon to as far South as Santa Barbara, CA. The main winery,  Hall Wines in St. Helena, Napa Valley, has additional varietals you won't want to miss either.</review>

They have a large selection to please a diverse group, and great arty atmosphere. There is no food served her though, so you may want to pop next door for Napa's best pizza or across the street to the OxBow Public Market for a quick snack before heading in.< /Review><GmapID>0x8085066432c0f07b:0x6c49bf4bfa8356db< /GmapID>< pictures>

We are wine club members here and really enjoy stopping in whenever we're in Napa for the weekend. The staff are always pleasant and welcoming and they have a nice variety of wines to sample and/or purchase.</Text>

(Translated by Google) I really like this wine tasting experience. The host boy of the host Angus is very enthusiastic about introducing a lot of wine to us. The whole environment is very comfortable. If you come to NAPA, you must try it here.

很喜歡這次的品酒經驗，此次的host Angus可愛的大男孩非常熱情的介紹很多酒給我們嘗試，整個環境非常舒適愜意，如果來NAPA一定要試試這裡</Review>

<review>The best tacos in Simi. I live for this place. The food is authentic and tastes amazing! I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a quick bite to eat of some of the best Mexican food. They are quick and friendly and everything is made in house. The prices are reasonable and they have the perfect amount of options.</review>< pics>

I ate here for the first time. Had chicken tacos, they were good. The beans have that same taste as most restaurant. The food isn't amazing or anything, but they give you good portions and the prices is average for fast food.<//text>

This felt like such a great find! Doesn't look like much, but their food is just delicious! I've had their street tacos (seem like their specialty)and a couple different types of burritos. Everything I have ordered here has been awesome.< /Review>

<Review>I absolutely love tacos and this place knows how to make them with no doubt, plus the rest of the menu is fantastic there has not been one thing i tried and didn't like. the service is also a big reason why i always come back, very polite and hard working cooks who make everything at a fast pace and the food taste very fresh.<//Review>< GmapID>

We always order a sangria soda, and the combo with the tacos is delicious. We've visited a lot of taco places in AZ and CA, and Tacos Goyo here in Simi really nails asada tacos. Highly recommend you go! Absolutely worth it.<//review>< Pics>

And I had very good ones the other day at another taco joint so that tells you about the cooks skills here. Also they give you food on a paper plate. Now usually I'm all for that, because the most questionable places are the best! But stay away from this one!<//review><gmapID>0x80e829ad784828cd:0x61e1c75c05d5f1c1</gmapID></record>

The aluminum foil peeled back exposing all the Manteca  (lard) they used as it stuck to the foil. Like removing the foil wrapper of cream cheese...  I couldnt taste anything in my asada burrito.  No beans but added avocado.

Nasty.

Some may like it.   But beware.

The reason for 2 stars was the pickled carrots.

Those were yummy.  Should have had been peeled, but that is just me< /text><username>Fatih Senel</username><Rate>2</Rate><time>1505763416675<//time>< user>

<review>The food was decent. You can tell it's fresh and I always appreciate when a Mexican place has al pastor and lengua in addition to the classic carnitas steak and chicken. Prices are also pretty good: good size burrito for 7-8 bucks So that's the good things about this place. Here's the bad:

1 they serve everything with one time use cutlery and styrofoam plates so you're basically GUARENTEED to eat particles of styrofoam. You have maybe 10 tables with 4 seats each, you can't afford to provide your guests proper tableware?

2 cheese, sour cream, and guacamole are 75c extra. Guacamole I understand, but you're telling me I get almost a dollar worth of cheese or sour cream on my order? Give me a break.

3 credit cards are charged an extra 50c. This is just annoying. I understand you prefer cash but this is 2016.

4 almost forgot. No chips no salsa, those cost extra. Can't stand places that don't do this. Even Sharkeys gives free chips and salsa.

In summary, I think it's a decent place that has potential but until some changes are made it'll be hard for me to justify coming back. Too bad, I was looking for a good Mexican place I could eat at for lunch near my job in Simi Valley. The search continues.<//review>< UserId.>

<review>This location is now called TACOS GOYO, same owners, new name; it is NOT closed!  Food is as good as ever. Wonderful street taco's, amazing burritos and crazy big nachos, just to name a few.  They make great fish taco's too.  The enchiladas and the chili rellenos are among the families favorites. The Jamaica and the Horchata aguas frescas are quite good as well. Slip in and soak up some traditional Mexican flavor.</review>< Pics>

<review>Apparently, I was the first to try their new saag paneer pizza. It tasted fantastic especially with the parmesan sprinkled on top. The service was a little slow but it looked like they were quite busy. Definitely would recommend the saag paneer pizza.<//review>< user>

This place is AMAZING! The food was fresh & flavorful and the service 2nd to none! We actually ate it so fast we didn't take pictures. Thats our excuse for having it 2 nights in a row. The Saag Paneer was excellent and the Butter Chicken perfect, but it was the Chicken Tikka Pizza that stole the show! We only eat the crust when its worthy in this house and there wasn't a crumb left of this pie.

Besides the awesome food I have to applaud the service. The owner was friendly funny and warm. He even graciously accommodated the rush on our order without sacrificing an ounce of quality. WILL RETURN. Omw now actually.</Review>

<Review>This was my first time trying food at this restaurant and I ordered the Chana Masala, Somosas, Chicken Tikka, Garlic Naan and a side of rice. Everything was delicious and tasted fresh
It was honestly some of the best Indian food I have tried. Pret was friendly when taking my order and made the food fresh, so took about 30 minutes and was sincerely worth the wait! You can always order ahead and pick up when ready too! I will be coming back to try most dishes.

This place is Delicious and fresh and I highly recommend the gyro pizza sandwich! The pizza crust is the best I've had in a long time and the combo of gyro with that light crusty goodness was a pleasant surprise! Im ready to go back for more. This place Rocks🎸< /Text>

Service was wonderful.

I ordered a vegetarian pizza and it came with a lot of veggies! This is rare when I have gone to other places they're skimpy with the toppings. Their saag paneer is also very delicious, would highly recommend it.< /review>

<Review>Love coming to this place for their Copenhagen Gyro pizza, it's delicious! Their Tandoori pizza is really good too (kind of reminds me of bbq chicken pizza but way better). Samosas are also very good. Their chicken tikka masala sauce is mega delicious, but the chicken in it is a bit dry white meat. Just yesterday i called in to order food some they tend to take long i like to call about 25 minutes before I show up. They had made me the wrong pizza. I was very upset and the guy looked at me like oops what do you want me to do? After i told him to make me the right pizza and that ill wait he said he'd try to get it done in 10min and rushed to do it. Afterwards he apologized and told me to take both pizzas. All restaurants make mistakes but you can tell a lot by how they correct it and try to make it right with the customer. 👍< /Review>< Pics>

We ordered the Tandoori Chicken Pizza, Saag Paneer, Naan, etc.

The tandoori chicken pizza is one of the best pizza’s I’ve ever had ! I can’t believe I had never tried this place before. I highly recommend if you’re in the Torrance area. We loved all of our dishes. This place will be in our rotation.

It’s also worth mentioning that their customer service is excellent. They were extremely kind and I could tell they put a lot of care into their food.</text>

Get an ice blended dark chocolate and then walk around the marinas. There are miles and miles of paths for running, biking or walking. On Saturday mornings it's dog walking day at 10 am. This is referring to the Coffee Bean at the corner of Wooley and Victoria Road.</Review>

<Review>During this COVID-19 pandemic the service here in coffee bean is very still good...... the staff is still very friendly and helpful......... if anyone ever decides to go to coffee bean.... Please for the love of all that is holy..... PLEASE FOLLOW THE SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS OF THE COFFEE BEAN STAFF....... BE SURE TOO WEAR A MASK WHEN BEING PRESENT THERE...... PLAY IT SAFE❤....... SO THAT WAY EVERYONE CAN ABLE ENJOY WHILE THERE..... WHEN YOU PLACE YOUR ORDER & THEN PICK IT 😊  IF YOU ARE GOING TO SOCIALIZE WITH THE STAFF FROM COFFEE BEAN.... PLEASE I RECOMMEND IN MY OWN ADVICE: PLEASE KEEP IT SIMPLE........ BECAUSE A LINE OF PEOPLE WILL FORM VERY QUICKLY....... AND IT HAS BEEN RECOMMEND TO KEEP AT LEAST 6 FEET DISTANCE AND YET UNFORTUNATELY THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DECLINED AND DISRESPECT IN FOLLOWING THE HEALTH SAFETY RULES...... IF YOU SEE A PERSON WEARING A MASK.... DON'T BE AFRAID....... THAT PERSON IS TAKING THE NECESSARY PRECAUTIONS AND I HOPE PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TOO LEARN FROM THAT PERSON INSTEAD OF BEHAVING ARROGANT< /Review><Time>1590261127381<//Time>< pics>

As CB&TL go this place will not disappoint. What sets this location apart is the view. Great location for a nice morning/evening stroll through the marina.< /text>

As soon as you walk in you here someone saying Hello! That is so friendly and the staff are so cheerful. I had a sunset mango  breeze drink with whipped cream today. That was so good! If you want to stop in for a drink or a pastry it's super convenient. You can sit outside or inside very nice place.  Totally recommend this place also it's always super busy so you know it's a good place to stop in.<//Text>

Came to Ventura for vacation and was needing a good evening coffee. We came here. I got a coffee with vanilla creamer and a blueberry muffin and oh my goodness it was all so very amazing! The muffin was so moist and delicious! The coffee on point. Customer service was amazing. The atmosphere was very comforting even a sign said "if you dont like your drink, we can remake it" something like that. It was a neat coffee shop with a little something extra added to it to make it stand out. Check out the napkins too! :)
Then we took our delicious goods and stumbled upon the back area where the water and boats are. It was beautiful in the evening! Great experience!!< /text>

I love this coffee bean, excellent service and made my coffee in no time. I like coming here early in the morning and enjoy a cup of coffee at the patio. It’s really quiet and not too busy at this time, so I totally recommend it! Nice work guys!< /Text>

<Review>I like this coffee place because there is plenty of seating both inside and outside. Was very busy on a Sunday afternoon. Only two people working one taking the older and other making the orders. I like the drinks that they make here. Plenty of parking<//Review>< pics>

Love The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf. Their menu is awesome and we've never been disappointed. We love the blueberry cream cheese pastry, we almost always add two of these to our coffee order. Great service, great menu. The Fanatic and the Ko.Ko. are two of our favorites.<//Review>

<text>Anyone who drinks ice blended coffees and still goes to Starbucks after trying Coffee Bean... IMO is just plain crazy!  This is the best place for the ice blended drinks, hands down, nuff' said! Holding back on one star though for the discontinued blueberry cheesecake... BRING IT BACK PLEASE!</text>< gmap_id>

Its great to get a coffee and sit out by the water in the mornings. The staff is good at making drinks and they are friendly. My orders have always come out tasting perfect. Inside is cozy and mostly quiet. I will say the wifi is ok but that is what to expect from free wifi. Also, drinks are inexpensive compared to Starbucks.<//Review>

<review>Good place to find all your Mexican supply plus more!! Tortillas are freshly made and friendly cashiers. The only con i would say is that the meat department can use more friendly faces and better prices for the quality of meat you are getting< /review></record>

<Review>I love the atmosphere here they always have the Agua Fresca’s available in different flavors. Awesome selection of Hispanic foods and snacks. Lots of meat and fish to select from for those carne asadas. Very friendly staff and always quick check outs. Anyone remember when this used to be save Mart? Thank you state foods!</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>2<//rating><text>Food is good here. Authentic made mexican food is amazing. But just had a bad experience when ordering a cake. A 1/2 sheet costs you 40 dollars at Walmart. But because Walmart was all booked up on orders I figured I'd get my cake here. Well you're looking at 10 to 12 dollar increase in price with a decoration that you're not promised and box that it was practically falling apart. Not to mention no lid for the cake. One of the staff in bakery was very rude as well. I will never order a cake here again. Just did it for my little one because I wanted to make her a special birthday party.<//text>< pictures>

So they have a tortilla shop in house that makes fresh tortillas a bakery mexican food deli/ restaurant that does large orders for catering. Fresh meat butcher shop with all the different hispanic food items you might need.
Its all really good the grocery and produce are is well stocked so you can find most anything you need.
Most everyone is friendly but thier cashers can be a little rude no warmth when dealing with them its kind just get in and out type of feel.
All in all i give them 👍👍👍👍👍.
Because they actually deserve it i highly recommend this store especially if you are looking for some hard to find spice or item for a special mexican food plate like mama used to make😇< /Text>< pics>

La Cocina mexican food inside not worth the time or money. Meat is under seasoned and salsa has no flavor or spice. Too much cinnamon in the horchata. One star because limes were fresh and juicy.<//Review>

Excellent Mexican grocery & fresh meat market. Restaurant inside, fresh Horchata, Freshly made tortillas to purchase. Regular groceries are a bit overpriced. I will usually go there for my meats and look at their sale paper because their sales are really good.</text>

< Review>
I called to the store to see if they had any  agua fresca so when I called the automated answering machine told me what department did I want so I asked kitchen  it' said  That extension was busy So then I tried the tortilla department and it said the same thing that the extension was busy so then I called to the store and some young girl  answered she did not know what I was talking about so I told her to put a Mexican speaking lady so she did..I asked her if they would make aguas frescas  fresh fruit waters and was suppose to check what flavors they had so she went to the back..came back n said they didn't have watermelon water.. so I asked what do you have..and she was guessing..so I don't think she even went to check..she also said that the kitchen was closing.so becouse of that i couldn't get anyother fruit flavor water..and the front cashier girl sounded  ..very inexperienced ...</Review>

I was attracted to this store after reading their weekly add.  The ribeye steaks $4.95 a pound.  A great price for ribeye steaks.  I was impressed by the variety and the quantity of displayed meat in the meat department.  I was also impressed by the size of the ribeye steak on display.  Was it bizarre that one ribeye steak was at the top of the pile of ribeyes and near the display window for the consumer to see, while all other ribeyes were covered and not visible?  I was helped quickly at the meat counter.  This has been a good experience up until this point.  When I got home and unpacked the ribeyes to prepare for the bbq.  I was disappointed.  Quickly the disappointment turned into a feeling of bamboozlement.  I replayed in my mind the nice lady at the meat counter packing the ribeyes in the bag.  There were three steaks she packed the first two steaks and lastly a very nice large ribeye steak on top.  The two steaks packed first by the nice lady look like less expensive chuck steak. What is this???

Is this the way they do business?  Have you been bamboozled by this store?  No thank you State Foods!  I will stick to shopping at quality stores.  I prefer not to be bamboozled.<//review>

I go for the daily specials. The staff is friendly and everyone always has a smile. If you haven't tried their fresh corn tortillas you are missing out!< /Review>

I like the cleanliness of this shop...fresh foods...fresh sea foods...unfortunately a behind the counter clerk put my expensive shrimps in a plastic bag!! It leaked all over the front counter check out...and I don't believe that's how you pack to go goods that are fresh...what a mess...had to go back to meat counter n ask for extra bags...should be placed in small containers...like all their other to go.. no bueno...booooooo</Review>

Great meat selection. Sometimes the service is rude... depends on the time of month I guess.</Review>

It is such a big store and yet a very small selection, Or they dont carry it.  Everything costs to much. They do have a few things iv gone to buy but because it was out of  convenience . People are friendly,  thats always nice. Music is cool just lower it down some. Love the sweet bread ** that is where i owe two stars. And the hot food is good. Makes the stay at the town house feel close to home , lol !< /Text>

You can buy groceries... There's a carniceria and a tortilleria (I'm making up spelling here)  in the store. You can get food to eat in there or take home that's already made... A taqueria.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I like this suitcase because they grill the tastiest bread and the manager Daniel is very attentive to all the people but I don't like the woman who is the manager, sometimes she doesn't have a good style to serve people I recommend you ask every hour the birote comes out And for the vegetables for whatever vegetable or fruit you are always looking for in the afternoon there is a boy named Salvador Zendejas is very kind to attend to all the people he is very attentive as Mr. Daniel is the best store in Sanger

(Original)
Me gusta esta maleta porque asen el pan más sabroso y el gerente Daniel es muy atento con todas las personas pero no me gusta la mujer que está como gerente  aveces no tiene buen estilo para atender a las personas les recomiendo pregunten cada que hora sale el birote y para las verduras para cual quier cosa de verdura o fruta que busques siempre en la tarde está un muchacho que sellama Salvador Zendejas es muy amable para atender a todas las personas es muy atento como el señor Daniel es la mejor tienda de Sanger< /Text>< Pictures>

(Translated by Google) They should lower their prices a bit because most are high and if you compare them with walmart there are lower, the difference is that here state foods have fresh meat and meat but still some things are exceeded in prices
