< Review>
When this place was in Terminal 2, it was much swankier. Now it’s a bit more cramped and lacking showers and space to spread out but that doesn’t mean it’s bad. Some of the nicest people work here and make you feel welcomed and invited. They keep the drinks and munchies stocked. No, they’re not serving sandwiches — not a single Maple Leaf I’ve been to does that. However, they have some nice soups, hummus, salsa, tahini/yogurt, two different salads, edamame and cookies. Thanks to Maria and Alexis for making travel that much easier!< /Review>

Clean.  Bright. SMALL. And VERY slow elevator. Definitely needs more seating. Quiet relaxing space.  Decent snacks and beverages.</review>

Small lounge, there’s not enough seating and it’s cramped.. sitting areas so close to one another that you hear all the neighbors conversations. Food selection limited, and ran out 2.5 hours before lounge closed. Only apples available as fruit option. Departure screen at back hidden behind some decorative wall, so you have to get up and walk all the way across the lounge to see info. I literally scraped the dish to get the stuff that’s in my picture.</Review>

<Text>The receptionist is not kind enough to help me verify my status even though I show a valid star alliance gold , ask to go out and only able to go in after calling copa airline customer service and they have direct contact with the receptionist. The food is not as expected, maybe because it is early in the morning around 6:00am. Ambiance is decent but a little small.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Fantastic lady on the front desk. Janelle helped us fix up our horrible seat allocation to Toronto. She worked away for a couple of hours for a great result. You are an outstanding representative of your airline Janelle. They should be very proud of you. Rob & Alison<//review>

The old MLL in Terminal 2 was much roomier and spacious.  This one is small and cramped.  The elevator up to the lounge level is very slow and is often crowded.  The lounge is still a good place to relax, grab a quick bite, a beverage and get some work done in a quiet place.  It can be crowded at times but the majority of my flights out of Terminal 6 is at 6:20am for the LAX to YVR flight so there are few of us in the lounge at that time.</Text>

It needs more hot food with meat/ fish dishes for afternoons and evenings. Lunch is mainly vegetarian pizza slices and some pasta salad, and soup. Otherwise always great to get away from the hustle and bustle of the airport terminals.</Review>

Listed online as open from 5am and onsite as 430am. And yet there is a whole queue of tired business class passengers queueing outside a closed maple lounge door at lax at 545 am. Are service standards so low that even premium service hours are subject to an employee's waking timing?? Appalling<//text>

Nice lounge to relax before the flight. Nice verity of soft drinks fruit and snacks.
Just make sure you have access to the lounge b4 taking the elevator up. Saw a couple people being denied access. I felt for them.< /review>

<Review>Arrived at the lounge at 8am and it was not very busy.  The pros are there are many coffee choices, some juices, and limited fruit.  What I qas mot impressed with the choices of food, there was not much to tie you over.  There were limited newspapers and magazines, so after an hour we had to leave to grab food for our connecting flight.  The Air Canada lounge at YYZ offers a lot more options, food and drinks wise and many magazines to pass the time.  This was a stark contrast and not a lot of consistency.  Would have loved to stay longer, cleaner bathrooms and relatively peaceful.  The staff were very good at LAX lounge.  Always coming around to offer to take things away, they were very pleasant.</Review>< Pics>

The food selection is pretty minimal. Really off putting when the front desk does not acknowledge you... pretty sad customer service skills. The ladies working in the food area were fantastic and the reason for the 2 stars. Not keen to fly air canada out of LAX again.<//text>

Not the best when they have no way of knowing what flights are.. ie so you know about delays before trekking down... and the guy at front desk is bored and doesn't notice anything and people letting their dogs jump on your chair and lap and kids screaming.   Ick</review>

<text>Very efficient . Everything clearly market to follow Covid guidelines< /text></record></dataset><record>
<Review>The best place ever....... love the ease in reserving books, if Campbell doesn't have it then put a hold on it. ....... and it usually comes within a week !!! The staff is beyond helpful !!!  Weather permitting the little grass area is perfect with a cup of tea and a book.  (No crowds)</Review>< name>

<Review>I love this place. Self checkout is super fast & returning items, even quicker. Makes it really easy to get what you want & go. I wish they had more recent movies, but still, there are a lot of good dvds, cd's & books. Great library!< /Review>< UserId.>

My insurance was active yet I was told that it wasn't. I paid the full amount of the procedure and found out later that they were using outdated information(insurance that was no longer current). I called to tell them, they checked again and told me it was inactive. After three phone calls back and forth they finally got a hold of my insurance company and told me the money would be refunded on my follow up visit. I asked about the refund and was told that the insurance company had not been billed yet and their billing department would handle it from here. If I get my money back I'll be surprised. As I said, the dental staff is competent but their office staff not so much. I don't think that I will be returning.< /review><resp>{'time': 1619466696759, 'text': "Hello Marc, we're so sorry to hear about your experience. We want to know more, to help resolve the situation.

<Text>I went in the office an hour early to see if they would take me because I was in so much pain. Dr. Ody Zoma walked me through everything and made me feel at ease. I was done and leaving in an hour and half. I will go back to see Dr. Zoma again. All the staff was very nice.  This is going to be my dentist's office from now on. Thank you Dr. Zoma.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Time>

This a hit or miss, hygienist, and Dentist are great, but as for the business communication with the receptionist, They could use some training, errors on setting appointments and all around attitude towards the customer. It is not right to send every call to hold and make them wait for over a half hour, then hang up, and then when you try back they forward to the 800 number. I just don’t get it! By the way still on hold @ 36min and counting, afraid to hang up as they are now closed.< /Review>

Service feels rushed.  one time, I decided to do whiting teeth treatment! was the most painful treatment I have had, lower and upper frenulum got damaged!  was uncomfortable for a week. They had an untrained guy train with me, when I went back for the DR. to check, he just gave me Lip service!!!! I went back to do clean up twice after that, but, Wait time was extremely greater than the 10 minute rushed  cleanup service they performed.< /Review>< pics>

Was not happy about services. Last week walked out because the wait time to get treatment was gonna be over 3 hours and so patients waiting to be seen. Then today after waiting to get a filling done on a tooth that lost the filling get told have to come back next week due to the fact that he is completely backed up on patient. So now gotta deal with pain till the. If he can't handle all the patient then they need to cut back on patient appointments. It's very unprofessional to make client's who wait for nearly 2 hours to be treated told they can't be treated after all.<//Text>

So appointment time was 11.30am we got here at 11.15am been waiting 2 hours!! We stepped out I told someone before stepping outside to let my kids drink water and eat an apple no more the 10 minutes. My son was called back. While we stepped out. They took a lady who only been here 30 minutes she has his room. So unprofessional they could of called me in. Very disappointing my poor kids. No restrooms! No eating or drinking which okay why we stepped outside. Please go somewhere better! I will be changing dentist soon no doubt about that!!!< /review>

This is my third time going for 1 thing.  First their doctor left while they did my xrays. Then I needed to come back for my fillings. But it took them 3 hours to do just 1 filling because they kept trying to do something that would cost me $500. And I kept saying no. They have signs for females who take birth control, that they will receive antibiotics. And I never got any, and I'm in a lot of pain from the tooth they did. They also had to do a cleaning but 3 hours was long enough and I have a pediatric appointment to get to for my son. Made another appointment but will be going to another dentist. I have an infant and cant keep going every week for 3 hours just so they can work on 1 tooth at a time. Then try to say I need something else that cost $500-$1000< /Text>

In 2 month they gave me several appointments but never kept one and all of them where for emergency dental work because tooth was cracked and nerve exposed. Every time I went for their appointment they always had an excuse why they couldn't see me. The last appointment they gave me was emergency one I said if I can go to San Bernardino which was a 40 mile one way trip I was in a lot of pain so I said yes after I got there on time they made me wait an hour before they said I wasn't assigned to that dentist office that they weren't taking me but they made the appointment and they said it was okay on the phoneI would never go here butch of cheats. And I'm going to Mexico to get my tooth fixed they said luckily infection didn't sit in while I was waiting those two months.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

At first, I was a bit trepiditious about going to a corporate dental office but as I was in terrific pain, I went in. The office staff are courteous and caring. The dentist who took care of me was quick and professional. Today I returned to have my tooth extracted. Again,  the staff are wonderful. My doctor today, Dr. Velasquez, was really terrific! So gentle and kind, I'd reccomend him to anyone who is afraid of the dentist. Thank you! Keep up the good work.< /Text>

Only care about the money not the patient. Waited 1 hour in a waiting room with only 3 people in it then 2 more for them to even begin the cleaning. The doctor TOOK LUNCH BREAK IN THE MIDDLE OF MY APPOINTMENT!!!!<//Review>

I love the Dr's at this location. Both men drs we have seen are wonderful, kind, and compassionate! Scheduling is a whole other story. I feel bad for the Dr's after patients have been there for hours waiting, by the time they see them they are so mad they take it out on the Dr's. They really need to NOT over book so we can get in and out! My son only had 2 cavities to fill I shouldn't have been there for 3hrs for that!<//Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I havent gone to a dentist in over a decade, i was scared out of my mind. They made sure i was numb and although i was a bit of a pain in their rear end(i did my best to control my mouth aka my tongue, but it was out of my control all that numbing going on) Anyway they were great, although im in pain, thats what happens after the good stuff is all done. Did just have them work on my mouth for like 6 things. Well worth it, i have my confidence sort of back. And totally trust the doctor. Although im sure i will be a pain in their rear end they made it worth it, and definitely am going back to do more. They made it easy for me, and i cant imagine someone not giving them that trust. Professional and to the point. My only complaint would be that my insurance didnt cover all the cost. But if i had to compare costs over pain i'd pay the money to get this doc ten years ago when i never wanted to go back to the dentist ever again. Thats my experiences. 90's were the worst but even 2010 felt like a nightmare i didnt want to relive. It was just too good to be true this time, had to be. But it wasnt, it was the experience i should have had for the last 34 years of my life. Thanks guys, you were all great. Keep it up!< /Text>< pics>

Worst dentist ever. They only care about your money and the doctor was so rude I was ready to curse him out but held my composer as much as possible. They will sweet talk you into spending your money, and they claim they would do something about the rude doctor and didn’t. All they’re going to do is apologize like they did the rest of the reviews and not do anything about it. Have emailed the company about it and no response. My lawyer is now taking care of it.< /text>

<Review>Some grandmothers take there grandkids to the dentist because mommy is working. I took my grandson so they can check his tooth that was bothering him. I didn't have a problem. He was scheduled today at 12noon to have a root canal. Once I was called in they ask me if I was mom. I said no I'm grandma. So one of the nurses said we're going to need mom consent. I don't have a problem. The problem I have is when I first came and I was filling out the papers that no said. Ma'am are you coming also to bring the boy to see the specialist? I would have said yes. Then your receptionist would have said ok " here we need these papers filled out by mom so that when you bring him she has given you consent to move forward with the specialist ". Hello.... not once they informed me and a day wasted. Very poor conmunication. Then they schedule me a month to bring him back. By the time I come back with him and the consent papers his tooth will fall off.

Grandparents be aware.

They should have a sign reading.

Grandparents you need consent from parents.</Review>< Pictures>

WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE EVER!!! Xray tech did not know what she was doing. Another tech had to re-take everything. I experienced the worst pain I have ever felt during the extraction of a lower molar. The dentist did not care if i was numb enough, he just wanted to get it done. It felt as though it was done without numbing. UNBELIEVABLE PAIN!!!< /Review>

If you have 3 hours to do nothing for your dentist appointment.... Then this is the place you have to be. They never run on time, receptionist don't know when you'll be called, they overbook because the orthodontist only comes once a month. Just horrible.. .Looking for a new dentist if anyone knows a good one!<//Review>

I was very satisfied with the the back staff. The xray tech I think his name was Jose too was the first one that attended me. He made me feel welcome and safe. Was very gentle with me while I was in pain. Will come back for sure on my next check up.</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Do not bring your kids here! My children recently got their fillings done and both of them had one fall out 😔 I made what the receptionist called an "emergency appointment" not the next day but an entire week after my call, so I say "okay" come the day of the appointment I show up early with my kids missing school for this said "emergency appointment" only to find out that the specialist is and will not be in today!!! -.- so they were planning on two appointments being made to refill a filling they didn't do right in the first place.  So i cancelled the appointments.
I ask if i could at least have my kids excused absence note and they said "no" because i cancelled 😞 like "wow wow wow" hated my experience and the wait time to be seen speaking from the previous experience was not worth waiting for again especially if nothing was going to get done.
Save your time!
Go somewhere else.

<review>Such a great office! Clean and great location. Carla was so sweet!! There was a bit of a wait since there was ortho but she kept me updated on the wait time. Eddie took my x-rays and he was very gentle since I was in pain. I was so nervous and he made me feel like he cared. Even took the time to explain the steps of dental treatment. I got to see the dr and take of my pain all on the same day. I definitely recommend this location. 5 stars!!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< date>

VERY Poor management of a business. Why do they make a appointment times if they are not going to keep them? Nor do they have the courtesy to tell you that they are running behind schedule so you can make plans.  Waiting nearly an hour is ridicules. Arriving 15 minutes early did not even help. Very dissapointing customer service and not professional. I would give them a BIG ZERO STARS 00000. As you can see the problem I had is an ongoing and unresolved issue that the owner cares nothing about.</review>

<Text>If you have denti-cal or any low cost insurance they’ll treat you like a low class patient. You will be last priority. I went in (with an appointment) with excruciating tooth pain to the point of tears. I sat there 4 hours before being seen by a doctor. I was one of the first to arrive. People came in with appointment times after mines and were seen before me. More patients came in hours after me and left before I was treated. I was the only patient in there for a while just crying in pain. I literally heard them in there describing patients by their insurance. “Oh he’s PPO I’ll go see him.” I got up and said I was leaving then that’s when anyone payed me any attention.<//Text><Rate>1<//Rate>< Name>

Worst waiting time ever. So disrespectful! Don't care about patients.
After making the first appointment we waited 2 hours to do the x-ray for our 7 year old daughter and still couldn't make it to the cleaning because had to wait more... made another early morning appointment for cleaning & ortho.
Even though had came on time at 9am the cleaning took place around 10:30am and it's 11 and still waiting for the ortho! You guys are so disrespectful & don't care about people's time & life's needs. This is how you say you serve?
I give it a 2 star just only because of the good front desk behaviour.<//Text>

As of todays date (03/30/2017) this office has provided the absolute worst customer service I have ever received at any dental office. The woman working at the front desk went above and beyond being rude, and should really look into taking some classes in proper customer service skills. I recommend going elsewhere to any and everyone.< /Review>

<Review>Had two appointments today at 2:15 and 2:45pm, sat there for two hours, when asked how’s much longer the rude receptionist said I had two more people before me, than asked if I wanted to reschedule. 4 other people who came after me was called before. Finally got frustrated and left. Don’t waste your time. Not only to you wait when you have a so called appointment the people in the front are rude!!!<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c354ed116ed0d3:0x62fcdd2984e8d2da</gmap_id>< user_name>

After dealing with the office and corporate calling every day for weeks and after bringing copies of my receipts to the office itself they threatened putting my bill - which was paid and they even had my receipts to prove it - into collection, on my credit report and charging me additional money for none payment! These people especially the front office and corporate are nothing but sleezeballs who will stop at nothing to get you to pay twice! Since we are in the process of buying a home I paid them again to avoid having my credit hit as advised by my attorney but he is now compiling information on other people that they have done this too!

I waited for  1 hour and then ask the resepcion lady how many patients are before me and the lady said 6 then I sat for 30 minutes more. I became impatient and  went to ask the lady one more time and she answered 6 people before me so I expressed my frustration and she recommend me to make a new appointment I say "okay" and just as she started the process to make a new appointment, the nurse came and said my daughters name 😡 I complain why she said 6 before me and then she told the nurse and said "no no no I made a new appointment for her" and did not let me come inside. I am tired of wester Dental and will change my plan.< /review>

Absolute worst experience of my life. Wait time even with an appt was 3 hours and when they finally sat me in the back the dirty tools in front of me were not mine. I had my wisdom teeth extracted and the dr doing it poked my lip with the needle and made it bloody. Here I am going on 2 and a half months after having my wisdom teeth extracted and I’m still having pain. I’ve been in the office 5 times since the extraction and they see me for 5 mins after waiting 4 hours and tell me nothings wrong. Give it another 2 to 3 weeks and come back. This denatal office is a joke. The staff is very rude and the place smells and is unsanitary.</Text>

Staff wasn't very friendly , the worst was the doctor , she came looked at the X-rays , didn't acknowledge me or my son . She didn't even look at me ,  she says no cavities only cleaning and turns around , I then ask if his teeth were growing in place and she's says I'll refer you to ortho and turns around and leaves . The girl who cleaned his teeth was a lot nicer but I mean your patients  are kids be a lil friendly , smile , or Atleast introduce yourself. My appointment was at 315 got called back about 345 not too bad but it's not 5 star service here for sure .</review><Gmap_id>0x80c354ed116ed0d3:0x62fcdd2984e8d2da< /Gmap_id>< resp>

Most unprofessional! They had me waiting for a quote and every visit I was waiting in the dentist chair for 30 to 50 minutes. Also the started a root canal that went bad, I needed emergency help with it and could get an appointment for two weeks. Then they just cancelled that appointment. I'm fed up!<//text>

<Text>This Facility states they DO NOT take medi-cal/denti-cal. I tried to take my child to the dentist and the receptionist said since they are new facility they have a pending application, this was back in May 2015, I went to the same office yesterday (August 10th, 2015) to try and get my son seen, since I felt the application should have been approved, and yet they again tell me they do not accept med-cal/ denti-cal Patients.

I called western dental 1-800 # and asked them if this new location at 2046 Highland Ave takes Medi-cal/ Denti-cal and they told me as of 2 weeks ago a letter was sent out to ALL western dental and they ALL take medi-cal/denti-cal. If I have a problem making an appt to have the western dental call the corporate office in front of me.  then they transferred me and the Highland office never picked up the phone after 23 minutes on hold I hung up. I ended up going to the facility on Baseline, and the dental assistant was watching Disney channel the whole time she was supposed to be sucking spit from my sons mouth, I had to tell her to get the spit before he choked.  Ridiculous!! you can't watch Disney and pay attention to the patient.  why is a TV in the operation room anyway?  I can understand the other chairs, to keep kids occupied, but in the surgery room where they strap them down and put a mask on their face, They cannot see it... it is for the workers?  such bad work ethic.

I believe this office does not want to service the community it operates in.

Hope they understand that they opened in a community that probably 95% have denti-cal..... they won't stay open long without revenue.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

They will reschedule your appointment's without notifying you. This has happened a few times in the past 6 months. I arrived at 9:30 for a 10:00 appointment was put in a room and told to wait cuz my crown isn't here yet. It's now after 12, I haven't gotten any updates.<//Text>

They let me choose extraction over root canal and got me in a couple days later.. I was able to be numbed up within minutes and they had that tooth out so quickly I didn't have time to raise my hand.. What a relief.. Im thankful for western dental and their staff at the Highland location..<//Review>< pics>

While I do enjoy fatburger tremendously, the service at this location is awful. Multiple times they have closed before the posted 9pm time, locking me out of picking up my online order. Fatburger generally takes longer to cook their burgers which I appreciate.  But again this location consistently take much longer. The staff is rude I don't not recommend the studio city location, and I will no longer be visiting this location<//text>

I love a big, hearty, tasty, juicy burger and that's exactly what Fatburger sells. The sweet potato fries weren also excellent, and the service was unbeatable. Y'all should come to Texas!

<Review>The burgers here are really good and fresh, and they do not skimp you on meat. Tje fries are good, and the chili cheese fries are even better, especially if you get fat fries. The milkshakes are okay. They are usually pretty busy, so service is usually pretty slow.</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
I would say that of all of the fast food restaurants that serve hamburgers in this country, Fatburger is the best. Everything about it tastes great and that make it all fresh, from scratch, right there in front of you. The only downside is it takes time to cook a hamburger correctly, so these hamburgers are not ready in 1 and 1/2 minutes. It usually takes about 7 or 8 minutes and that for some reason just seems weird because we are also used to food being ready in 30 seconds. They are doing it the right way and the quality shows!< /Review>

This is not my first time to this Fatburger location. The first time being there was meh. The food was amazing, don't get me wrong. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the food. The service on the other hand was subpar. So I did leave a 1 or 2 star review for that visit. This time, they got it right. The cashier was helpful and when my vegan family went up to order, the cashier knew exactly what they meant when they said Impossible burger and vegan cheese. Gonna come back again especially since it's pretty close to Universal Studios. The food here definitely beats the food on the City Walk and it's a hell of a lot cheaper too. 😃<//text>

I love Fatburger! I love it better than the other two competitors In-N-Out and Tommy's, Fatburger is the place where else can you get your fat better made the way you want it charbroiled or grilled they even have a king-size Fatburger you literally haven't made to your liking they'll even put egg in it if you want. And you got a choice of onion rings skinny fries and fat fries and you can even have them topped with chili and cheese if you'd like. If you have never tried Fatburger please give it a try you will fall in love with it. Oh! I almost forgot their milkshakes are made with real ice cream on-the-spot and they even have a jukebox to listen good old-fashioned rock and roll and oldies while you're eating your Fatburger! Now the other two competitors cannot top that at all!< /text>

First time going there, nice little place burgers were good except they messed up a few of our orders, like adding relish to a burger or forgetting fries or just straight up forgetting a whole meal. Wasn't too busy was a but disappointed about the missing food but maybe I'll be back to give another chance.</Text>

50 bucks for mediocre food for my family of 4. Think that was it for me... I'm done. Took forever, funky cheese I didn't ask for on my burger that they accounted for when I complained instead of correcting....4 burgers 3 fries and 3 drinks....50 bucks. Seriously.  Go elsewhere.< /text>

If your a burger guy, try getting the XXL, food is really good here. Excellent customer service and the restaurant is pretty clean.

Only the parking is really bad here, but you got street parking.

I like Fatburger because the burgers have s thick, tasty slab of meat that sets it apart from other burger chains. I also like their onion rings. However, management needs to train their workers better--in all locations--so that they appear to value their customers more. This has always been an issue.<//text>

<review>Great burgers and great fries but a little pricey. Parking is tough and tight but if you're looking for a meal that will fill you up it's worth it. The service is good and the place is kept clean. I've been going for years and I would reccomend it to anyone. Plenty of great toppings and they even carry a vegetarian alternative which is excellent. Their chilli fries are also good and a nice size serving. Good place to eat.<//review><username>Paul Robertson<//username><date>1562347870425</date>< rate>

I hope the manager recognizes him as a team member like that can have a huge impact on the customers experience.

Everything was great, despite the rainy weather. One of the best burger places LA has to offer. A bit on the pricy side but still really good.< /Text>

Sweet staff and fun customers. Even after a long day at Universal up the street, it was a much needed carb comma. Delicious fries and fresh ingredients. Thank you guys for making my night.<//Review>

Great Burgers, fries and shakes. Fat Fries is what most people like, but I prefer the skinny fries. When you walk in you will see some signed celebrity photos that should tell you how popular this place is. It is located in studio city where many celebrities live or go to work, so it is expected that many celebrities go here.</Review>

First and foremost....the burgers and fries (not like the fries you get down the street at the other places.) are super juicy and tasty...( I gaurantee as Justin Wilson used to say...google it you won’t be disappointed....) the parking is a bit tight, street parking is available.</Review>

There was mayo on the impossible burger and I didn't realize until i was almost done. I had hoped they would make it right when I called about it, but no luck.

If you like chili burgers this is the place unfortunately i don't but even if you don't order a chili burger it still tastes like one. Guess they don't clean the grill to often.</text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>1st time in fat burger and it will be my last I came in today to get a burger and now I have diarrhea I haven't stopped going to the restroom since I got home from them 1hr later. I'm not sure how there keeping there meat or bacon but i was fine till i ate there. I never go out of my way to post bad reviews but I'm in pain because of the burger, fries or coke I got from them today. My asss hurts and I'm bleeding from using the restroom so much. Something was done wrong today with my meal and I feel sick. Hopefully you get a visit from the health department to mKe sure your keeping up with safe food preparations. I will never eat at fat burger again.< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Uh, do these ppl work for this restaurant? My turkey burger was dry and bland, I had to drink with every bite. My husband got a fat burger, it was a greasy mess! My sweet potato fries = salt. Save money and your arteries! Overpriced, over-hyped fast food!< /review>< pictures>

I'm not sure how there keeping there meat or bacon but i was fine till i ate there. I never go out of my way to post bad reviews but I'm in pain because of the burger, fries or coke I got from them today. My asss hurts and I'm bleeding from using the restroom so much. Something was done wrong today with my meal and I feel sick. Hopefully you get a visit from the health department to mKe sure your keeping up with safe food preparations. I will never eat at fat burger again.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

< review>
It was almost two am, it was15 guests one guy seems to be of the street. The store seemed to be dirty at thAt hour being 13 guests all walked in around the same time and the cashier did take out trash while the ladies cooked most the food mithril was dirty when we walked in the store was kind of dirty but what got me is that the mixed couple that was there Latin lady in the black man the women were discussing and they shouldn't have been looking And discussing like that other than that tell you to mind your own business</review>

<text>Love fatburger restaurants in general. They have the best Low Carb burgers! Just ask for the "Skinny burger" The meat is delicious and they make them on the spot, you can add a bunch of ingredients to it as well.. everyone i've taken to FB loves their burger options with buns as well.
This location is a good place to stop by after going to a event in the area.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

My buddy and I went down for some Fat Burger.  Low and behold, we both only got one slice of tomato each on both our burgers.  It's a $5 burger.  Never in my life have I only received 1 slice of tomato and a burger this big.  So many restaurants are skimping these days, but this is ridiculous.  It's supposed to be a big burger with a ton of stuff on it.  It's a good tasting burger, but the value of the burger is priced to high for what you get.< /Text>

Other customers came in to order and the soda machine wasn't fixed then. This isn't the first time we have eaten there it's going down hill the place is in bad shape needs a facelift inside and outside too.<//text><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2be46cd2f2a6f:0xa9c29a13d8ae5f19</gmap_id><username>Penny Owens<//username><user>104349591745069158204</user><Pics>None</Pics></record>

Small hole in the wall burger joint with a few tables for indoor eating, the burger was everything I expected it to be, well made with fresh ingredients and not at all sloppy, lives up to the Fatburger name, great spot.< /text>

Not clean, especially the bathroom. Food was mediocre. Only advantage is that it is open very late night and it is across from the Hollywood Bowl shuttle drop off< /text>

This is our go-to donut shop. They open early so it's the perfect place to buy donuts before an early shift and if you go in the morning, the donuts are super fresh. They have a variety of drinks too like milk and juice and coffee</Review>

Fresh donuts that our family enjoyed on Father's Day. Grandpa and grandma really liked the maple bacon bar. Tasty and affordable.<//Review>

Always friendly, clean and courteous. Donuts are delicious, always get a raspberry filled and the filling is tasty and the donut, soft and fresh. And they have these to die for smoothies, my favorite being the banana strawberry. which is why when we come though Bakersfield we always stop here.< /text>

We had an excellent experience moving with Sullivan Moving. From Dave Young, our estimator, and Connie Gardner our Coordinator, the move was handled expertly. Our driver Carlos was the best we have ever had. He was courteous, knowledgeable, and professional. I would use him again on any move we might have in the future. I would also recommend him highly to anyone planning a move.< /Review>

< Review>
I am an Air Force brat and moved all my life as a child. As an adult had 4 business transfers.
This was by far the most experienced and professional movers I’ve ever had.
They were professional, kind, responsive and followed Covid procedures.
The BEST team ever moving. They made a horrible scenario of moving good.
It was a pleasure knowing they had my back and they loaded fast, handled change well and were all around GREAT!  Yes I would use them again and highly recommend them.
Thank you Sullivan Movers-United!< /Review>

Did exactly what they said they’d do and on time. They were quick, friendly, and professional and came in under the estimate by several hundred dollars. Highly recommended.< /review>

Laurel was great to work with. Our moving quote was very reasonable from SD to Rosarito and she explained the process to us. We asked her to make recommendations with elementary schools and a rental agent and she was very knowledgeable and helped with that too.  Company goes above and beyond. What a great experience.< /Text>

<pics>None</pics><text>Although we didn't book with them, I would like to commend Troy for his expertise and professionalism. His "sales pitch" commands a standing ovation, and if it wasn't for our tight budget, would have booked Sullivan just on the inspection. Nicole tried her best to do the research and see if she could price match the lower quote. Even after we had to unfortunately go with the other quote, she still held the utmost professionalism and positively reviewed the company we were going with. I still wished that money was not an option for our case so we could work with them, since they seem like a trustworthy, respected, and professional company which it seems like is hard to find with moving companies.<//text>< user_id>

Wanted to get my camper van weighed so I could ship it to Europe this summer & travel with my grandson for 3 months.  They had a public scale & for $10 I got a certified weigh ticket.  Quick & easy.< /Text>

<text>I am currently unpacking boxes that were packed for my move last week. This is my fourth move packed by professionals. Never have I seen such horrible, unprofessional packing. Check other companies before signing a contract with Sullivan. The Sullivan representative spent a good bit of time telling us that Sullivan was the best company in San Diego. I can’t imagine a packing job worse than mine. We did have wonderful, professional United Van drivers that made the loading and unloading process easier.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>My entire move experience was excellent from start to finish.  The loaders and driver were professional, friendly, fast and efficient during both pickup and delivery. All of my belongings arrived intact and quickly as promised. All in all this was the best move experience I have had among many moves over the past 20 years. I would gladly recommend Sullivan movers and would use them again in a heartbeat.</review>< username>

<text>Sullivan / United Van Lines were easy to work with, housed my stuff for a month and brought it all the way from Orange County to Vancouver, BC with no damage. The customs and declarations portions of the trip were a breeze.

They were clear communicators every step of the way and affordable considering the distance and time. Would absolutely work with them again.<//text></record>

The Sullivan Moving and Storage team that handled the specialty packing and loading of my household goods was beyond exceptional.  Every person and every detail was handled with utmost care.  Five stars for Sullivan!

However, once my load left San Diego on its way to Dallas, some of that care was lost.  The transfers inherent with small moves (one bedroom) over long distances did result in small nicks and scratches, but overall I would still give the total experience a 41/2 Stars.<//text>

<text>Outstanding! From start to completion. I was given a price far below what I had anticipated due to previous estimates from other moving van lines.
I was updated as to when the movers eould show up and begin loading  and I was updated as to when I would receive delivery of my home items; including exact times.
Nothing was damaged and the delivery gentlemen set up and put everything where I requested.
Great teams, make great companies.<//text></record>

<text>Magnificent care and customer service throughout!  Truly, I could not have been happier with the team that helped us pack plus the team that delivered everything intact (and I mean EVERYTHING)!  We had a HUGE move with multiple collectibles and oddly shaped items, but all members of the team were exemplary!  The group overseeing logistics were fantastic and the teams that handled packing, loading and delivery treated our homes and goods as if they were their own.  For all of the moving horror stories you hear, it was so incredible to have such an exceptional experience as a part of such a stressful process.  I cannot recommend Sullivan Moving and Storage highly enough!<//text>< Pics>

I have known the folks at Sullivan Moving for over 20 years.  My recent move from San Diego to Columbus was on schedule and under budget.  We packed our own items and had minimal damage to our own containers...One box was lost out of 380 items.  Their claims group is right on the issues and I know we will resolve them to my satisfaction. I recommend them for any move either short or long haul.< /Review>

This move with Sullivan - my second - went smoothly, without issues.  All of the Sullivan staff made the move as easy as it could be.  Although I don't have a lot to move, I'm far from an experienced nomad (remembering the definition of a true nomad as being a person who can gather all of their belongings together in a day, and be on their way). Thanks to Sullivan; I would strongly recommend them if and when you must move, otherwise stay where you are, and spend a quiet evening with friends...</review>

I sought in-home estimates for a 3,000-mile move from California to New Jersey from four companies, and United/Sullivan's estimator, Troy, was by far the most thorough -- not only with his inventory of my possessions, but in our conversation, in which he gave me more information than any of the others.  It was Troy's thorough assessment and visit that tipped the scales in United/Sullivan's favor.  A cross-country move in summer is far from cheap, and United/Sullivan's estimate was one of the highest, but once the move was complete I was sent a $700 refund because the weight of my load wasn't as heavy as anticipated.  The packers did a good job, and the driver (Terry) called me when he said he would and arrived at the new house on time.  I would recommend this company.</review><user_name>shirebound</user_name><rate>5</rate><time>1504180898667<//time>< user_id>

<Review>At the end of May, I moved my 7,000 lb. household from a home and two storage units in one storage facility in the San Diego area to two storage units in another storage facility in the San Francisco Bay Area. This was a very complex move!  I experienced the smoothest possible, and even pleasant moving experience! Each step of the way, from my partnership with Dave, the move coordinator in the planning stage, to loading and unloading with fantastic movers (Danny & Mario in San Diego, and Nicholas, and Manny in the Bay Area), under driver Nick Corby's highly professional, unflappable, and caring direction, everything was five-star all the way!  Unfortunately, I've had to move many times, and this was definitely my best experience ever. Thank you so much, to each of you who participated in my move!< /Review>< Rating>

I used the chat box on their moving and storage website to ask about ballpark prices for moving and storage and was told that they didn't do that.

*DO NOT USE THIS MOVING COMPANY*
I moved to San Diego to work a tech company here and the company arranged for moving logistics and I thought it would be hassle-free.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  I would have rather moved things myself and traded some sweat for damages and missing property.
1- Every piece of glossed wood furniture I have was scratched noticeably (or looked more like it was gouged in squiggly lines and circles).  I get that some wear and tear is inevitable when moving things, but I noticed that none of this furniture was covered at all, not even with paper or saran wrap.  It just came out of the truck unprotected.  I had one medium coffee table, a medium side table, 2 small stands, a kitchen table and computer desk.
2- I'm missing some smaller mobile items that I didn't notice was missing until later. Namely a new skateboard and quality work/utility gloves.  They happened to be in the same area in my old apartment and I've now noticed they've gone missing.
3- They take inventory of what they've packed, and you sign off on it.  They're in a hurry to get out of there after packing up and so you need to go through 4-8 pages of logged inventory and quickly see if anything is missing.  You can probably take your time and go through it meticulously if you remember every single item you've had packed, but they let it be known they are in a hurry.  Also sometimes a line item will be something like "various kitchenware", so not everything is specified.
4- On unpack you have to try to note damages while they are moving things in.  It's also not that pleasant whenever you note on the forms any damages and the mover always asks, "is there a problem, bro?" when you do so.  I listed the shattered glass lamp that they took with them, as well as my dented metal trash can and ripped leather recliner, etc. in my damages form, but not the wood furniture.  I should have listed the latter, that's my own fault, but I got tired of the stress from dealing with this stuff.  I also didn't notice my new skateboard and gloves were missing until later.

I can't really go back and fix this frustrating experience, but if I knew this was how it would go down I would have gone out of my way to either move myself, or research another company that might care a little bit about my belongings and respect my property.

I can buy a new skateboard and gloves for about $200-220 and just accept that my furniture is scratched, but I shouldn't have to.  And you shouldn't either.   So either be absolutely meticulous with the paperwork for your moved items and note all damages and missing items, or find another alternative.  I really wish I had...</review>

< Review>
Troy Becker explained exactly what we needed to know for the move.  Lindsay Reid the coordinator kept us abreast every step of the move.  Pat the driver and his crews were excellent and nothing was broken or scratched.  I never hired an interstate mover before and was nervous.  They solved every problem for logistics.  Parking a huge truck on a curved street where our apt was is a challenge and they took  it in stride. They were on time, called when they promised and very kind.  Keep in mind when you are moving long distance the truck moves several households at once. The truck has many side doors so they can get at your belongings from any part.  It does take days to get to you. It took 6 days.  We brought pillows and blankets and slept on the floor until they arrived.  They advised it would be 2 - 12 days. They called the day before and showed up right on time.  Thanks Sullivan and United Van Lines for making a nerve wrecking move easy!< /Review>

Alvin and Nick did an outstanding job moving my family member's most precious furniture. They were on time, courteous, did the job in a timely manner but were very thorough about wrapping every item and taking care to not damage anything. Chris from sales gave a fair and accurate quote. No hidden charges or fees. We would highly recommend Sullivan moving & Storage.< /review>

I've used professional movers about 10 times in the past 40 years. Last Friday, Carlos and Robert moved me out of my Dana Point apartment in a heartbeat, unloaded even faster in Lake Forest (despite the toasty day) and were a pleasure to be around. Consummate professionals and a delight to spend time with. If (and when) I ever move again, Sullivan gets the call ...</text>

< Review>
Hiring this company for a local move was one of the worst decisions I ever made. Their quote was significantly higher than other movers, but they seemed more professional, had great reviews, and were the only movers who moved plants. When they first arrived, one guy immediately started smoking while waiting for the truck to pull up front. He continued to smoke during the move whenever he took breaks. The entire crew seemed to take breaks a lot and for extended periods. I get it, moving is very tiring and it was hot, but it seemed excessive. They also failed to wrap my plush chairs and sofas, so not only did they get sweat on them, but also the loose pillows fell on the sidewalk. The drawers on all my furniture slid open and got banged around because they were not wrapped, either. In fact, nothing was wrapped. It wasn’t until I called their office to complain about the smoking and lack of care that they finally wrapped one sofa. The smoking didn’t stop, however. When they were done 5 hours later, they tried to charge me for the entire estimate of 7 hours. I called their office to dispute this, and they told me someone would call me back. While waiting, they got a call from their supervisor, who I could hear clearly. He asked them for my last name, then immediately asked another question: “Is she a f***ing Asian?” Needless to say, I do not recommend this company, unless you don’t care about your possessions, love the smell of cigarette smoke, and enjoy being called racist slurs by management who don’t care.</Review>

We are professional movers and we pride ourselves on offering excellent service to our customers. We are very sorry that you did not receive the experience you were expecting. We apologize for the smoking that took place, we have shared this with the crew supervisor and will be sure it doesn’t happen again. The crews sometimes pad wrap the furniture in the home and sometimes wait until they are at the truck to wrap the furniture for chances of the items slipping out of their grip while moving to the truck. We are reviewing our procedures to be sure we are consistent going forward. In regard to the comment that was made, we have spoken to the parties involved and they stated they did not remember saying that, however, if it did happen we greatly apologize as that is not acceptable or tolerated. We will continue to investigate.  We understand that the number of men that came out was more than what was estimated to you, our dispatchers do this sometimes to help make the job more efficient, and the calculations of men and hours would always be the same as what you were quoted or less, however, this should have been communicated to you prior to starting. It looks like your final charges were about $400 less than your original estimate. Again thank you for taking the time to share with us your experience. We need to always learn and improve.

Seriously superb service. The entire team at Sullivan demonstrated the highest level of professionalism. From quote to pre-move planning to packing, to moving, to delivery and un-pack as well as follow-up this team was amazing. They showed up on time, were incredibly professional, very courteous and amazingly efficient. They finished early, were under- budget and executed flawlessly. Plus, they are cool people. Highly recommended.</review>

They might be a bit higher than others, I've never compared prices, but their moving teams are extremely professional and very careful with packing and moving belongings. I would never use any other company! I highly recommend them...< /Review><rate>5</rate>< userid>

Problem 1: WRONG DELIVERY (A container for Sydney was delivered to HK; the other container for HK is still on the way to Sydney. Sullivan mixed them up in US)
Problem 2: BAD ATTITUDE EVEN AFTER MAKING THIS TERRIBLE FAULT (My impression is that Sullivan does not care about its customers even this situation!!)
-> DO NOT BE FOOLED INTO THINKING SULLIVAN WILL TAKE CARE OF YOU OR YOUR BELONGINGS WELL AFTER YOU HAVE AN INSPECTION - IT WILL HAVE TWO FACES ONCE YOU SIGNED THE CONTRACT.
Problem 3: HIDDEN COSTS / OWN INTERPRETATION REGARDLESS OF THE CONTRACT

Here are the details.
Problem 1: [WRONG DELIVERY] Our family have two containers: one for Hong Kong, and the other for Sydney, Australia. The company mixed up our two containers in US. In HK, we received the container supposed to be delivered to Sydney (What a surprise!), and the other one supposed to be delivered to HK is still on the way to Sydney. You can imagine how your life will be without your belongings. Of course, the expected delivery date is not guaranteed one, so you might expect a certain level of inconvenience when you move to other places. However, this is different story. Can you do this for two months due to the moving company’s fault? We are having very difficult times living without our personal effects. We had to buy redundant items that we should have received already in HK, and had to go out for lunch or dinner more frequently than we usually do. We are going to file an inconvenience claim. In sum, your containers could be found in other places.
Problem 2: [BAD ATTITUDE] We were completely shocked in HK due to the wrong delivery. We asked this company about its detailed plan of actions to deal with its fault. However, we didn’t get any detailed plans (we got just general short email, that is it). So, we itemized each question to help address this issue, but AFTER TWO WEEKS we DIDN’T GET ANY SINGLE RESPONSE. We are the one who called the local moving company to find out what is going on, and Sullivan didn’t respond it. This is what you are going to get from Sullivan if you sign the contract. Be careful. Sullivan does not respect its customers. Isn’t it this company’s responsibility to update relevant information to customers to fix this problem? This is obviously Sullivan’s mistakes, but we felt that this company is acting as if there isn’t anything happened. When the company inspect your house, you might think that this company will take care of you and your belongings very well. This was same for us. But, DO NOT BE FOOLED. Once you sign the contract, they won’t. Besides this absurd situation, the company has not been responsive / not kept its promise: Sullivan told us that we would get a regular (say weekly) updates about our shipment, but it never happened. This is what this company is. You will spend a lot of time and efforts if you work with this company.
Problem 3: [HIDDEN COSTS / OWN INTERPRETATION REGARDLESS OF THE CONTRACT]
I was informed that I need to pay extra delivery charges because my apartment is on 4th floor. I didn’t quite understand why this is the case. See the below my contract with the company.
"Rate Includes: Dedicated move manager from door to door, ... , normal access loading at residence, ... , complete delivery to residence with normal access, ..." Also, "Rate excludes: ... charges relating to limited access delivery (..., 3rd floor or higher with NO elevator use, ...)”
My apartment has an elevator, and the local moving company can use this elevator. Even though the contract says “3rd floor or higher with NO elevator use” will be charged for extra costs, Sullivan replied to me saying that “that is not how it is interpreted”. I was shocked again. The funny thing is that our family has the same, but separate contract for HK moving. Terms in the contract regarding rates are exactly the same with the contract for Sydney. But, when this company wrongly delivered Sydney stuffs to HK, they didn’t charge any extra costs for delivery even though our apartment in HK is located in 15th floor.<//Text>

This place is okay, they claim they run a tight ship. But their warehouseman slow down every crew in the morning, making the average crew take an extra hour and a half. Ever wonder why your movers show up late in the mornings? This is why..< /review>

<review>I moved from boston->san diego (self managed, not corporate).   I started out with another major van line and was not pleased because their estimate was non-binding, they provided no in-person estimate, I couldn't specify an earliest delivery date, and the shuttle cost was extra (if I couldn't beat their truck out here, minimum storage started $1000)... these things were causing great stress for me.   From the moment I started talk to Landy Parce at United, I felt a weight lifted off my shoulders.  Very professional, and without me even asking about the concerns I had with the other company, he presented the opposite scenario... binding estimate, in-person inspection by a United agent, specify earliest delivery date, shuttle cost included, and for LESS than the other company estimated.  Landy was very responsive at all hours and days.  The driver Frank Perry was outstanding, not one item was broken scratched or missing.  He arrived at the day and time he had specified NINE days earlier (I was first loaded, last unloaded), and Frank personally kept in constant contact throughout the journey.  Also, their binding estimate allows for up to 10% overcharge if the weight estimate was off or you throw some extra stuff in...  in case you're wondering whether that's just automatic, it's not, there was no fat thumb on the scale, the final bill was 0% over the estimate.  I can not find one thing to complain about with this company and this agent, I will use them again for local moves as well.</review><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

<review>Everybody underestimates this little hidden gem in Fullerton. The chicken here has a special flavor. You can get a whole roasted chicken Soo juicy and tender with a side of a very delicious rice and beans and free tortillas for under 20 bucks. Worth every penny. The owners are very demanding when it comes to food flavors and it shows. The building might look sketchy but the owners are very humble people.</review>< Pics>

About don pollo
... the chicken has great flavor just that if its gonna be rotisserie I need the skin on that chicken to taste like rotisserie chicken. Place needs a drastic remodeling other than that great job don pollo.</text>

Their designs are always GORGEOUS and the customer service is impeccable. They designed my flowers for my bridal shower and on the big day. They delivered the flowers to our venue in San Marcos and the coordination with the on site team was seamless. They were able to capture and complement the romantic/rustic themes of the venue. I couldn't have asked for a better team!

They put as much care and design into smaller arrangements for Mother's day, sympathy flowers, and birthdays. They make it so easy to order over the phone or online and their delivery is always on time. I love that they send you a picture of the flowers you ordered.<//text>< Date>

<review>Very pleased.  The flowers are beautiful and very similar to the picture on the website in style and flower type. They are lovely. I ordered them late yesterday and they were delivered early in the day.< /review>< pictures>

Very helpful and friendly people! We were patient and they came through beautifully with our late order. (They could have refused us but worked with us.) My 96 year old mother was delighted. Thank you so much!!< /Text>

Just purchased a flower arrangement online to be delivered and flowers were not the same not even close. Original photo online showed roses and there were none on the arrangement that was delivered.</Text>

<text>Second time I have gone into Cerritos Florist. Once again, I have gotten the most beautiful complement from the arraignment that I have had sent out.
For beautiful, fresh and unique bouquet.
Do yourself a favor.
Only go to Cerritos Florist .

<review>I’m extremely  happy with the service and the quality/presentation of the flowers. My good friend just lost her mom. I ordered a bouquet online after hours on a Sunday and it arrived the next day as requested. The flowers were even more gorgeous than the photo and they really cheered my friend up. Thank you, Cerritos Florist, for making things easy and for arranging such a beautiful bouquet!< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I ordered an arrangement for a co-worker who lives in this area.  The florist was great to deal with, they even sent me a picture of the arrangement prior to delivering.  The arrangement was stunning both in quality & design.  I am out of state but wish they were local to me!< /review>

This place is the best place for flowers! I’ve ordered from here since high school (I’m 40 now). It’s a local mom and pop so service is key. They always do beautiful arrangements with the freshest flowers.< /text>

Placed an order online from NY morning of, flowers were delivered by 1pm her time. I got three emails letting me the flowers had been arranged and assembled, that it was on it's way out, and that it had been successfully delivered. I had to call them to let them know no one would be home to receive the flowers, the nice lady on the phone told me they would find a nice shady spot to leave it. That was pretty nice. I guess I have a new florist in the area.

Oh and the flowers were also really pretty, they moved my sister to tears. Pretty good< /text><name>Evan Yoo< /name>< date>

Needed a nice, sophisticated arrangement for the grand opening of an office on short notice. Cerritos Florist came to the rescue. Kathy was super friendly and helpful. I got the "Zen arrangement," which features fresh orchids. It was a gorgeous, fresh, colorful arrangement. The beautiful creation was very affordable, and it was a great experience. I will definitely be back for any flower needs!<//Text>

I enjoy the store. Vivian, who attended us, was really kind and supportive. I just didn't give five stars because, like anything else in California, the prices are expensive.<//text>

I found out today that an ex co-worker and friend died.....and his service is today!! I called Cerritos Florist and asked if I could have an arrangement delivered to the funeral home within 2 hours. The very helpful and kind woman told me yes!! She was so wonderful. I arrived and was so pleased with this beautiful and masculine arrangement. Thank you!!< /Text>

Today, I ordered a bouquet for my best friend's birthday and I couldn't be more pleased! When I got to the shop, I could already feel the love walking in. The staff is the friendliest and everything in the shop is thee cutest from the decor to all the little trinkets.

We are beyond please with our floral design.  Vivian and her staff did an amazing job.  They were prompt and gave us more than we could ever imagine!  We gave her colors and ideas of what we had in mind.  They exceeded both of our expectations.  She worked within our budget, and we couldn't be happier!</text>

<Text>***Might Mess Up Your Delivery***
If I could give them 0 starts that would be a better rating
I ordered from here on valentine's day to have them send flowers to my girlfriend, I used them before and they messed up the order the first time. They apologized and gave me a refund, so since they where so kind as to refund me I gave them a second chance, and personally spoke to someone on the phone as asked for the same thing as last time just a different flower since it was valentine's and I wanted to get there $120 dollar deal. When it came to the day valentine's day I waited all day for my girlfriend to receive themy, but she didn't. I called them at 2pm one hour away from her leaving work and ask if they could please deliver them before she gets out of work because that is what I asked them to do on the phone and they said they could, now it being 3 I call them and ask if they got them delivered or not. They tell me that there about to put them in the van and that they were told they had until 4, I told them no she leaves at 3 so since my girlfriend was 10 minutes away from them I asked her to pick them up and I apologized to her. When she arrived at 3:30 to pick them up she asked for them and they didn't have them ready.
After it all she finally got them, but I was not happy with what happened even giving them a second chance.<//Text>< pictures>

Had the free intro hot vinyasa class and this place blew me away ! It looked like a swanky city club inside and was super clean! The class was great , I even cried at at the end with a good hip opener sequence the instructor had us do. Everyone was super friendly I would totally come back and recommend this place for beginners or more advanced. Seemed like a one size fits all class.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><name>Debbie Lauber< /name><review>I recently switched studios for their top notch yoga classes alone. Love the zen atmosphere of their beautiful yoga room. I was focused on yoga, but I have found that Tru-Fusion’s variety of offerings and diverse ability levels of all the different classes has been amazing. Add to that a clean, gorgeous, modern studio and impressive skill level and the sincere friendliness of their teachers and management has been first class. You won’t be disappointed!< /review>< time>

I am a long-time member at Trufusion Blue Diamond in Las Vegas, and during Covid I was forced to move home to the Bay Area and to my delight I realized there was a Trufusion in Walnut Creek! I have been extremely pleased that this location operates in a very similar manor to my usual studio, as I had become so accustomed to it.  If you are a fan of hot classes and want lots and lots of variety in your workouts, this will be the ideal studio for you. You will feel welcome every single time, whether you are a beginner or a seasoned veteran. TruTribe is there to get you feeling amazing and confident again! 💪🏼<//text>

Liiiisten! I love this studio. Classes are beginner friendly for the newbies in fitness! They're also perfectly challenging for the most veterans of exercise gurus. For the product you get (so many types of classes under one roof), the price is a steal. This business is ethnical and honest, and all the instructors are thoughtful to remember each client. Come consistently and frequently, and you'll benefit the most!!<//text>

Beautiful and clean facility! Great instructors and classes to choose from. I love that I can drop my spin and yoga memberships and just have one that does it all. The bathrooms are big and nice for the days when you need to be showered and off to the races.< /text>

TruFusion has been a game changer for me! Such a variety of classes all under one roof and more importantly one membership. The heat takes the workouts to the next level which is just what I needed. So many great instructors that will motivate you and play the best music to keep you pumped. Facilities are beautiful as well as the customer service. Join the TruTribe!<//Review>

Being someone who’s always enjoyed exercising since high school, I found myself in a serious rut with my overall fitness while exercising in your standard big box gyms. Since joining TruFusion my excitement to go to the gym has been greater than it’s ever been! I literally leave classes drenched in sweat and check the schedule to see what class I can choose from the huge variety offered under one roof. TruFusion is very well run(Kate), extremely clean, with beyond friendly staff who are genuine and encouraging. I’d highly recommend TruFusion to all genders, ages, fitness levels because the fitness staff will find way to cater to your exact needs!</review>

Nice club,  great classes.   Front desk personnel is unprofessional and make it impossible to try and cancel your membership.  The manager,  Kate took 2 weeks to return my calls and emails after I left 3 follow up phone messages and 3 follow up emails messages.  This location may need a stronger more experienced manager who is accountable for her staff and one that can respond to customers in a timely manner.</review>

TruFusion is exactly what I’ve been looking for!  I can get bored easily at the gym but NOT at TruFusion.  I can get my yoga cravings in one day and the next do some kickboxing or boot camp classes.  The teachers are so welcoming and encouraging.  With 3 active kids life is hectic but I seem to always be able to squeeze in a class.  I am hooked and found my forever gym!<//Text>

<review>I really love all of the classes I have taken at Tru Fusion. While parking is somewhat annoying, the instructors and variety of classes are awesome. Two things might be deal breakers for me to continue my monthly membership...cost of childcare per hour is very expensive if you plan to use it multiple time per week and they need many more earlier classe times (5:00am weekday and 6:00am/7:00am weekends). It's also a bummer that the best and most challenging yoga class is at 4:00 PM. For someone with a family, these things  are so important. I suppose this might be the perfect place for the "millelial" with no family, job or regular time commitments.< /review><user_id>104865622360524518243<//user_id>< GmapID>

<Review>TruFusion offers a variety of high quality classes and provides great amenities (towel service, showers/lockers, juice bar). The coaches get to know their students, so I always feel welcome. Not to mention accountable if I miss one of my usual classes! I'm a kickboxing and HIIT junkie so at Tru I can do those things AND mix it up with yoga, spin, etc. The YinFused class (yoga + foam rolling) is amazing for sore muscles! Other favorite classes include Barefoot Bootcamp and Soulful Sunday. Be prepared to sweat! You will leave feeling stronger, calmer, and more confident. If you can only join one gym, this is the one.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Took my daughter to get her eyebrows done and asked for a clean up. The lady took it upon herself to thin them and completely change the shape. Afterwards they offered a discount for next service instead of service they did and awful job on. My daughter was in literally tears. Don’t trust them with your eyebrows.<//Review>

<Review>I set up an appointment same day and they honored it  as soon as I came in. The place was super clean and professional. Beatrix did my nails and I loved them. She really takes her time and makes sure you are satisfied. Will be coming back and asking for her again!!<//Review></record>

<review>Absolutely horrible! Went here today for a gel pedicure. The girl that worked on my feet spoke no English and didn’t even try. The only reason I am giving this place one star is because the girl that my cousin has was nice kind and super attentive. DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU CAN GET NENE!</review>< response>

First time getting my nails done, ever. Read the reviews and gave this place a shot. I got the powder ones in a pointy shape. A month later and they're still perfect. They're a lot longer and I have to fill them in but they're look at fresh as day one. I did get hurt by the person doing my nails once, hence the 4 stars instead of 5. I suggest making an appointment as if you walk in there's a big chance that you will have to wait. They even have wine for you while you get your nails done!</text>

Staff is great! The shop is clean and they use clean tools. They will be hosting a princess event every other month. They recently had Elena of Avalor. They had cookies and water for the kids and mimosas and wine for the parents.< /text>

DONT COME HERE

What I asked for and what I got were two different things. I did ask for a different shape than the reference photo, but that's about it. I went in at 2pm, and I left two and a half hours later and not even with something I was proud of. I'll admit it seemed like the stylist was trying, but I would rather them have told me that they couldn't do it.

Not only did she use a SHARPIE MARKER against my wishes (I told them when they put the clear coat on that it would bleed out purple and be a mess, and that's exactly what happened) but when she had to re-do them more than 3 times they tried to pin it on me. Saying that "well if you bought gel that wouldn't happen",  but other places do it fine 🤔, but other places also dont use sharpies on NAILS. Even then, at one point I TOOK THE SHARPIE AND DID IT MYSELF. It's bad enough you're using a tool against my wishes but if you're not able to do the design JUST TELL ME.
When I asked the main lady (the woman with blonde hair and colored eyes) if I could even get a discount since, this isn't what I wanted, I did some of the work myself because she couldn't, and the fact that the quality just isn't that great compared to other places I've gone, she told me that all she could give me was the first timers discount (which she was already giving me before this mess, 10% off). I pressed her because this wasn't what I wanted or what I was promised, and she gave me an attitude. "She was working on you for like two hours" (um WE worked on my nails for two hours because the lady who said she could do it, lied)  I told her even the lady who did the nails said "mal" to her friend and was saying she didnt even like them, she kept saying "feo, feo" ('mal' means bad, 'feo' means ugly), and the blonde lady snapped, saying "well then she can take them off if you'd like that". I told her I was already late (for work) and I would still pay, I just wanted a discount and that this isn't what I wanted, and they should've just told me they couldn't do it and I would've gone somewhere else. She said she could offer me 15% instead of 10. I was irritated and agreed. Even then, she charged me $42, which was what the price was gonna be anyway. I was late and tired of arguing so I just paid and left. So today I paid $42 for nails that are "feo", "mal", and bumpy, and it's not even all nail polish. She only took the sharpie off of ONE nail and proceeded with the rest. I came here because I saw good reviews, but clearly they weren't all truthfull.

{'time': 1537237295613, 'text': 'Hi Kayla,\nWe are sorry you were not completely satisfied with your service. We always want our customers to leave our salon happy with their services. We try to make sure our technicians go over every detail before your service begins, including design and pricing. You wanted regular polish for the service and they informed you that they could do it’s but it would take a little longer because the polish would have to dry in between doing each design of flames and checkers (I will post picture of your finished  nails in the photo section). The total for the full set you wanted with design should have been $55. The technician kept asking if everything was to your liking, and you said yes that the flames didn’t have to be exact. At check out you were given a 15% discount and she also took off the charge for the flame design that you were not satisfied with.  We will be happy to fix your nails for you. Please give us a call so we can make an appointment for you to come in and fix everything to your liking.'}<//response>

<review>(Translated by Google) Fatal yesterday I got an appointment at 6 pm me and my friend peanut and asked us we were going with great enthusiasm because a friend recommended us that place omg not even offered us the charge of taking was alone on your phone I think very bad customer service. The technique that was doing my nails had to lift and stop doing their job to give us a glass of wine as the receptionist or good afternoon gave us, much less water

PS: if you continue with that reception I think you will lose many customers
It was my friend's birthday and we were going to have the best time and it was not what I expected

(Original)
Fatal ayer obtuve una cita a las 6 pm yo y mi amiga maní y pedí nosotras íbamos con gran ilusión porque una amiga nos recomienda ese lugar omg ni siquiera nos ofreció la encargada de tomar estaba solo en su teléfono creo que muy mala atención al cliente. La técnica que estaba haciendo mis uñas se tubo que levantar y dejar de hacer su trabajo para brindarnos una copa de vino ya que la recepcionista ni las buenas tardes nos brindo, mucho menos agua

PD: si siguen con esa recepción creo que perderán muchos clientes
Era cumpleaños de mi amiga e íbamos a pasarla de lo mejor y no fue lo que espero<//review><GmapID>0x80c2cd979d8d1f81:0x477fab133e1bfef9</GmapID></record>

Been coming here regularly. Best service. They do get busy but for good reason. David Guzman took care of me today while I had my little one with me and made my day. Great service all around and has been my 3rd time around of many more to come!</review>

<review>I am happy to say that we were able to replace our third and final defective Ford vehicle, which had transmission problems, and it's all thanks to Toyota of Glendale. We were there for no more than 2 hours and they had us walk out with a beautiful certified Corolla Hybrid. Eddie Vartanian was our sales rep. He greeted us with a smile as soon as we walked in. He was very knowledgeable about the car that we were looking to buy. We are 100% satisfied with the amazing service that they provided to us. Thank you for the amazing service Eddie!

<review>A waste of time and borderline unethical. They had me come in as a serious buyer and agreed to price both in-person and over the phone. Then at the last minute they tried to sneak in an additional $5K premium in the paperwork without mentioning it. It was a dirty, desperate move on their part. I would stay far away from this place.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1622059386530, 'text': "We're discouraged to read this and understand your frustration.

VERY poor communication and a very unprofessional experience. Wilson was in charge of my service. I was never updated on how long it would take to service my car. I had to call 2 days later and check and I was told it would be ready an hour after and when I showed up it wasn’t ready and I wasn’t given an estimated time on when my car would be ready.

I had to rent a car last minute and that experience was horrible as well. I drive a camry and the only car they had was a truck.

I went to get my AC fixed (on a new car I got 2 months ago) also the wireless charging port wasn’t working and didn’t even get fixed during my service!!!

Also car wasn’t washed (other Toyota dealerships in LA county are washing cars).

total time it took to fix my AC was 4 days and they didn’t even fix my wireless charging port.

Also when I received my car, the part under my glove compartment wasn’t even put back by maintenance.<//Review>

Definitely a good place to find Toyota models.  Agents are very helpful, especially Omar Dirky. He is a sincere salesman and trying his best to find a car that fits the customer's preference in terms of budget and car's functionality. With his sound advice, I practically got the one I really want. Thanks to him and to the dealership!!! Five stars!!!!!</Review>

Look, I don't like writing reviews like this, BUT I had a bad experience and I have to share it here because I never received a customer survey.

I came here for routine maintenance last week and was pretty disappointed with the level of service provided. I had to leave my car for a couple days (bummer), but I was offered a rental car (nice!). Unfortunately, I was not told the hours of the rental car place (Hertz), which closed before I arrived after work. (They're open 9-5 M-F, 9-12p Saturday btw) Since the rental car agency was only open at times when I would be at work, I was unable to rent a car. I ended up taking rideshares at my own expense while my car was in the shop.

I felt like while my technician was courteous, he couldn't wait to get me off the phone, and I never saw or spoke with him again after my car was ready to be picked up. I tried calling him back to tell him the rental car situation but he did not return my call, instead he sent me a text saying I could drop off the rental car at the shop. This was frustrating because I spent a lot of money here. The least they could do was acknowledge my frustration.

I'm giving two stars because I was able to use a 15% off discount I saw on the website, which saved me a couple hundred dollars. But I still paid through the nose to get my car serviced. My tech recently texted me saying I should be receiving a survey but something tells me they probably don't want me filling out a survey since I didn't have a great experience.

I won't be back.<//review>

<Review>Beyond amazing! My husband and I have been shopping for a used 4Runner for about 3 months or so. I saw Toyota of Glendale had a 4Runner that we loved; why? Because of the miles on the vehicle, the condition, and price. My husband and I have been shopping and visited a couple of dealerships before we head here. We drove from Orange County to Glendale to look, not acknowledging that we would make a purchase.

DJ W., sales rep, approached us. He greeted us and began helping us locate the vehicle. After finding the car, checking it out, I decided to do a test drive. I fell in love with it! But my husband and I had some concerns with moving forward with the vehicle since we are still paying for a Jeep Renegade and wanted to make a trade-in; we were hesitant because the previous dealership has let us down with a high down payment, high interest rate and low trade-in value.

DJ W. Went to informed Arthur K. we are interested. We discussed our situation and how we didn't want to do a credit check yet. We wanted to know what options were, giving the fact we know we had to do a credit check to be more realistic. Arthur K. Guaranteed me that he would be able to get a deal for us that day. No matter what obstacle they were facing with our finances and credit check.

After viewing our options, we decided to move forward with the purchase. Arthur K and DJ W. Worked hard on our approval, took a couple of tries to get the right bank to take accept the new car loan. I was amazed when Arthur K came back and told us he got us a sweet deal. We had a low out-of-pocket deposit with low interest; only my husband applied, no co-signer for the loan's approval.

I was very frustrated and opposed to dealerships because having greedy sales rep with sales manager be pushy and not take the time to help their customers. When my husband and I saw how they were working with us and not being pessimistic about what we desire, I felt confident purchasing the 4Runner from this dealership. The whole time we were there, I never heard DJ W. or Arthur K said NO; it was always a yes or let me see what I can do. I value their time, professionalism, work ethic, and communication. They worked with my husband and me. That's what I admire.

When it came to finalizing our purchase, we met with Freddy M, the finance manager. He was very kind and patient. He heard us out, answered our questions, and allowed us to review each document that was being signed. He wasn't pushy or hurrying us up; even tho that day was busy. Freddy M was very friendly and helpful. Overall they were all so sweet, generous, and kind. They are there to help and get what is comfortable for you and provide excellent customer service. I am satisfied with my purchase and will recommend this dealership to my friends and family. Thank you, DJ, Arthur, and Freddy!!!!! :)< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

< review>
I've been going to this toyota for a couple years for maintenance but this past experience was so positive I felt compelled to write a review. I brought my car in for service after being told it had untold problems with the tires, with the alignment, with the filters etc from another shop. Robert walked me through all of the problems and went above and beyond to ensure that my car was safe and that I left the lot happy. Car work is so intimidating, especially for people who don't know much about cars like me and are afraid of getting ripped off but he walked me through every charge and every change honestly and gave me the truth! I can't speak more highly of this experience - especially when good customer service is so hard to find (ESPECIALLY when it comes to car service). Thank you robert!<//review>

<Review>They deliver! This was best and easiest new car experience. Personally, I did not want to spend time at a dealer and they were happy to accommodate 😊  Both Joey and Mario were super helpful, knowledgeable, fast, and kind. Joey knew exactly the kind of truck I was looking for, sent me photos in the afternoon and then Mario delivered my beautiful truck to me that same evening. Best day ever! Huge thanks to Joey and Mario for making dreams come true!<//Review>< Pics>

I just got a Prius from this location and Marie was very helpful in the whole buying process. She was able to help me decide which car suited me best and I’m extremely happy with my purchase. I was also very comfortable coming to this location seeing everyone wearing masks and distancing themselves for everyone’s safety concerns.  Everyone there was very nice and I’m so happy with my new car!< /text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>This was my best car leasing experience ever. My 2018 RAV4 lease was about to expire in February but Toyota sent an offer to upgrade early.It sounded pretty good so I called Toyota of Glendale and connected with Omar Dirky. I told Omar that given the virus, intense heat, foul air I'd prefer not to visit the dealership. No problem. Omar and I worked out a deal on the phone, signed papers electronically and were done. When my new RAV4 came in Omar brought it to my house, went over the features with me and took my trade in. Easy. I can't say enough good stuff about Omar.
He was pleasant, professional and very efficient. Very nice guy and a pleasure to deal with.

I've been coming to Toyota of Glendale for almost 15 years now getting the same Gen 2 Prius serviced by my excellent service advisor Paul Flores and his team. I attribute the car's long life to the care I have received from them and am greatly appreciative. I know it may not be something everyone considers - going to the dealership to get routine maintenance performed on their car - but it has been worth it for me. I would highly recommend Toyota of Glendale for service.</review>

<review>I waited over 4 hours to get an oil change after making an appointment. I understand that the amount of people they have working is reduced due to COUVD, but why take walk-ins? And why keep taking more appointments and walk-ins if you do not have the capacity to do your services in a timely manner? Also, the indoor waiting room is open for people to sit in, and it can get crowded indoors and outdoors so it’s hard to maintain any type of social distancing.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Had the best car buying experience I have ever heard of. Sam Gekozyan took such good care of us and really cared about giving us a good experience. We never felt pressured, all of our questions were answered quickly and with great detail. The finance team was organized and fast so we were able to speed through the dealership and drive away in exactly the car we were dreaming of for a truly great price! Spoke with a lot of dealerships before this one and it was worth the drive for the experience we received.<//Review>

I am very grateful for the professional and exceptional service provided by service advisor, Christian Barahona, who has always delivered expert and quality work for my 20 year old Toyota Camry. Having recently purchased this car from a friend’s grandmother, who only drove 30,000 street miles in 20 years, needless to say, restoration costs could have been exorbitant but Christian has helped me budget my expense by addressing repairs based on priority. With Toyota’s outstanding service and warranties, I feel confident that my car is totally road safe and will continue to trust Toyota of Glendale to perform any and all necessary repairs.</text>

I leased my Corolla from Toyota of Glendale, and it was a very pleasant experience from beginning to end. I never felt pressured at any time. I have taken my car in twice now for service under ToyotaCare, and each time was a good experience. The two service advisors were kind and courteous; answered my questions, and the turn-around times they gave me were accurate. Very pleased with Toyota of Glendale.</text>

I had a pretty good experience with this dealership. I'd advise to shop online and communicate with them through email or over the phone to work out your deal. That way you can go in just to test drive the car and not have to negotiate price in person. I  was assisted by Jonny who was friendly and got me in and out with my vehicle</text>

Jack was an absolute pleasure to do business with! We had just had a terrible experience at Toyota of Hollywood in which the dealer was dishonest about the premiums. However, Melissa and Gabby were straight-forward about the prices and premiums when we emailed with questions before we came in due to our previous experience. Then, Jack was honest and willing to compare prices without pushing us into a decision. He helped us get all of the features we wanted in our car, answered all of our questions, and made us feel important. We very much appreciate the experience we had at Toyota of Glendale. Everyone truly made us feel valued!</text>

<text>I went to the service department on short notice with a broken side mirror. I had purchased a mirror and the Bob, service manager, was happy to use my part. When it took considerably longer than expected to complete the job he reduced the price of the labor. He was friendly and communicative.

It’s our community Dealership we get our cars serviced at Toyota of Glendale. Everyone is good with good attitude. I was a Tacoma fan but now i just can’t trust Toyota Tacomas anymore Toyota is like any other car or truck. I think by moving Toyota to Kentucky they lost that quality and dependability Toyota had. Now Toyota has tons of recalls they break down they lost that touch.<//text>

Bought a thermostat for my Camry, after I had it installed I found out it was defective, car got over heated. Tried to return it, they said it was used and refused to take it back or exchange it, and they tried to sell me another one. NEVER GO BACK TO THAT PLACE!</Text>

<Text>Job well done Toyota of Glendale

Especially during these hard times the service and individuals involved service managers when I arrive to drop my car off. The cashier accountant and service assistants when I return for a pick-up my vehicle.
Not to mention a clean sanitized car with a notice sign. THIS VEHICEL HAS BEEN SANITIZED!!!

I received a notice of recall for my Toyota. I called the Glendale dealer several times on different days to make an appointment. Either no one picked up the phone, or I was transferred and then that person  was not available. Finally, I called another dealer and got immediate response.<//Review>

<review>Customer service is horrible. Especially Filipino salesperson name Edwin. Very disrespectful and unprofessional. I wouldn’t recommend purchasing a car here. We already agreed on the car I wanted even shook Edwin hand to seal the deal. The following day to pick the car up. He said we can’t make that deal. I came back to dealer for nothing.

I had to negotiate again. After negotiations and came to agreement, I found out Edwin put stuff in the contract that he didn’t discuss with me. Twice this salesperson was very dishonest. My mother confronted him about it. Edwin yelled at my mother and sarcastically said no deal to her face. I wasted my time dealing with this person. I was ready to buy but this person is dishonest. I couldn’t purchase the car because of the dishonesty and the disrespect. If you don’t believe me. Just look up other comment below regarding salesperson Edwin from 3 months ago. Albert Arroyo had the same experience from this salesman.< /review>< userid>

I bought the Rav 4 XLE today. The features are the exactly what I want. I can link to my Apple cell phone to use google map to navigate. The staffs are nice. They explained everything very clearly. Gaby and Michelle was so patient to answer me questions in email. Max explained the features of the car. Manager Artur approved a good discount. I do recommend to buy car from this dealer.</Text>

<time>1595267395909<//time><rate>1< /rate><Text>Personally had a rough go here. Went in for an airbag safety emergency recall that I was told, twice, was going to take 5 1/2 hours. When I checked in, they said it was now going to take 2 days. No explanation as to why. I was then told I’d be provided a rental through enterprise, even though I’d told them I didn’t have my license on me and can’t get a new one because all DMV’s are shutdown due to the pandemic. They said “don’t worry we’ll take care of you”. Took the courtesy car to Enterprise, where their first question was, “Can I please see your license?”
I obviously should have known better than to believe that they would “take care of me” with my license issue.
I then take the courtesy ride back to Toyota from Enterprise, and pull my car out of servicing since I don’t have two days to spare without a car. The most aggravating part of the ordeal was watching car after car after car pour into the service center for basic repairs and servicing, with no appointments, while I’m being told my “emergency safety recall” is not urgent enough to fix in the usual time frame. It then took another 20 minutes for them to find and return my car. The whole ordeal took over an hour, when if the guy just gave me the correct information and did not promise to “take care of me” without knowing for sure, I would’ve avoided the entire fiasco.
No prioritization, overwhelmed staff, The employees are trying their best but there’s too many people just coming in for whatever with no appointment. Over promising and way under delivering. I got a reminder email from Toyota the day before my appointment.  Why couldn’t they include an updated servicing time frame then? Come on guys.
Todays experience told me that Toyota owners shouldn’t feel special and that I’d rather live with my potentially messed up airbags than to deal with that hot mess again.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Great Dealership and Great People.  I have to say "Thank you" to the "DEALER/OWNER" for creating such a "Friendly" purchasing environment.  My personal experience was truly a Good One...There was the expected negotiating the deal but after the Sales people figured out what was important to me - They created a Win Win situation for me and the Dealership.  Yes, I would definitely recommend this dealership but please know exactly what your looking for and these guys will try to make your New Purchase happen.  Right from the beginning, I was "Welcomed" by all employees I came in contact with and they made me feel at "Home".  I did have the usual stress of buying a new car but no one pressured me into buying a car.  After looking at all my options, they simply let me decide what I wanted to do, including walking away.  Remember these names: Michelle (Sales Assist), Mario (Sales), David (Mgr), Norberto (Fin) and Hamid (Specialist).  Great Team of people working at Toyota of Glendale that helped make my purchase & experience a "5 Star Experience".  If you are in the market for a new car - you should keep these guys on your list of places to visit - All the Best!< /text>

Bobby and the team at Toyota of Glendale were thorough, fair, and friendly. I will definitely be looking to them for all of my vehicle maintenance moving forward. Bobby even offered to help me sell my old car! Grateful to him and the team for giving me such a great experience.</Review>

Shout out to Mike Melidonian! Apologies if i misspelled the name, but this guy is such a rockstar! Give him a raise, cause he walked me through every aspect of transferring leasing info with such kindness and understanding it blew me away. He helped me understand every aspect and is so willing to answer any question i randomly have about the process. Give him a raise, cause his customer service quality is unheard of this day and age.</Review>

Peter has been my car advisor for over 23 years. I have to give him all the credit for making it possible for my old car (1995 Toyota Corolla) to keep on running to this very day. I now have a new 2019 Corolla that I absolutely love. Thank You, Peter for your continued advice and grand expertise for all these years and more to come!<//text>

Called looking for information and they insisted I come in person. The salesperson and manager I initially met with were fine,  but once I reiterated I was only there for information (which I had made clear when I called) and not going to buythe car that day,  they pawned me off to someone else and ignored me the rest of the time I was in the dealership.  Didn't even say goodbye  or acknowledge me when I was leaving even though I walked right past them.  Was going to return for the car,  but that experience left a very bad taste in my mouth and I will be purchasing at another dealership instead.<//Text>

<pics>None<//pics><rate>5<//rate><Text>Toyota of Glendale has been my place to go to for the last seven years. This time around, Jonny Pita Help me buy my new Hybrid Hylander 2020 and a Ch-R 2020 for my sister. I love both vehicles. I can say being in the sales industry, I am a hard customer. I am picky, and I like a fair price, and like an honest salesperson. Jonny was great! He speaks Spanish and that to me, that was a plus, love speaking and dealing in my language, Spanish. I spent two days with my Hylander and 1 in my sister's car. They worked pretty good deals for me. One was a trade-in, and it went very smoothly. I want to thank Peter Benarbashian and Artur Kirakosyan, who made magic with the numbers. As consumers, we want the best with what we can afford, and here at Glendale, they made it possible for me. I am always rushing, and they worked around my schedule. I highly recommend them.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Worst place ever, don't go there they cannot even answer your question they cannot even understand what you say especially when you return the car. In addition the manager is Oscar is one of the worst manager ever I seen in my life. if you buy the Toyota from other dealer when you decided to return to this dealer I mean Glendale Toyota dealer they tell you you have to return the same place that you get the lease car or buy car. Customer service is zero if there is a chance to give -100  Stars I will give them.</review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>This is a copy of my 2015 yelp review I have not been back since.

Shame on you Gary!

This was my second purchase, my family has bought nine overall from this dealership.  We were helped by Lisa Garret on 8 of the nine purchases, the ninth was Gary (Fleet Manager).  I have an agreement from my work that gives me $1,000 more off of the vehicle than Gary gave us.  I did the deal any way to keep our business with Toyota of Glendale.  We were going to trade in my wife's vehicle, and she decided no to at the last minute.  We were also talking about getting a second vehicle but I had mentioned that the payments from the current vehicle we bought was kicking our butt and we would have to hold off.    Two days later we regretted the decision and tried to call Gary six times (left four messages) to see if we could still trade in the car.  After a week, we called the other salesman that had helped us and he said he would talk to Gary (meaning he was there).  They said yes and I went in to sell our car.  When I got there, they wanted to walk me over to the second car we were looking at.  I said no, I am just here to sell the car.  They said they wouldn't do it.  That they could sell our car.  When I asked what they would have done with the car if I would have said yes on the day of the sale, Gary said they would take it to auction.  I asked why cant they do it now?  He started talking to me condescendingly and when I asked further questions, he asked me to "lower my voice." He was trying the old customer service trick of making a person cuss so they can ask them to leave.  I asked them why they could try to help a long time customer since it was obvious that there was assumptions made by both parties, I was told "You didn't get your way on one thing, and you are going to act like this," and "I don't mind if you stop being a customer."  On the day he was helping us with our deal, he was making fun of another family that was there to buy a car.  He told us that they had taken out a loan on the vehicle and that they "shouldn't even touch the contract."  All of which was inappropriate and information that another customer should not hear.  I had called the General Manager and left a message with the secretary regarding the issue and I didn't receive a call from him either.  Seems as though ducking customers is what Toyota of Glendale is all about!

The only saving grace for this dealership is Peter from the service center.  The man is a Saint.  If the rest of the dealership took customer service pointers from him, the place wouldn't have the rating it does.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I was greeted by Luis Rodriguez, who was very knowledgeable and thoughtful.  He helped me select a vehicle, stick to my budget and obtain the loan that I wanted for my car. I chose a 2019 Prius LE, and I’m very happy to have received such warm and professional service from Luis and his team.</Text>

HEALTH CONCERN:

DO NOT - I repeat - DO NOT sit with shorts at the service customer lounge - waited 2 hours (1 hour each time) for a shuttle and my right calf was eaten by bugs.

Have to cover it with hydrocortisone to sleep. They don't clean their lounge and empty the trash (it's so tiny). They won't put the TV volume down and "Karen" at the cashier will ignore you when asked.< /text>

<Review>We purchased two vehicles from Glendale Toyota from saleman Mario Luna... They have been incredible from the sale, through the service and support after two years I would still do it all again, and we are Toyota family for life.  Simply put this is  the finest automotive dealership I have experienced  and a definite reason I will keep on returning.  Ethical and trustworthy and they care about every customer.  I highly recommend</Review>< Pictures>

It was a very pleasant visit ! Everybody was  nice. Whichever way you turn , staff gave you a warm smile that makes you feel welcome and special. Elmer Hernandez was patient enough  to show me exactly the kind of car I was really looking for. Artur Kirakosyan of the accounting department was equally nice by explaining everything that was on the paperwork. And I was amazed at how everything went smoothly and quickly this time ! Thank you Toyota of Glendale for an exceptional customer service! You are the best!!!</Review>

Alejandro’s great customer service was great.

I was nervous about the outcome of the service since it had to do with engine light.

His follow up with time and genuinely answering all my questions was comforting

Go somewhere else. They are willing to take care of you while purchasing a car and once you have it, customer service goes out the window.  Had a recall on my car.

I needed to purchase a car unexepectedly (had an accident Thanksgiving and my late model Lexus sedan got totaled by my insurance company). I did my research looking for a reliable car that had all the current safely technology built in. I looked across several vehicles. I eventually narrowed it down the Toyota Avalon model. I also used the Costco Car Buying program, and Toyota Of Glendale was the supporting dealership I was instructed to go visit. I went test drive the Avalon. Loved it immediately. The Fleet/Internet Manager, Mike Melidonian, was absolutely fantastic in helping me sort everything out. He explained how the Costco program worked, pointed out factory rebates for my model, and basically treated me with respect and patience. Good man. Arthur in Finance was also very nice & helpful and we walked thru the numbers. All in all, it was a very nice, stress free transaction. Highly recommend this dealership if you are in the market for a Toyota in the Los Angeles area.<//review>

< review>
I went last week to take care of a recall on my 2018 Tundra and my service Advisor Peter Atmajian took care of me and the radar sensor was replaced. Peter always is on top of everything and I was out in no time. I recommend Toyota of Glendale service to everyone it doesn't matter even if your car is not a Toyota. They  will
take care of you!<//review>

I went to get an oil change around 9:40pm (they close at 10pm) tomorrow
Was a holiday and I was leaving the country and I needed the oil by that time, everyone was already wrapping up and JOSE GOMEZ allowed to get it done last minute. We need more people like him working that care for the satisfaction of the customer, rocky did the same as well. I am most definitely coming back. Thank you jose!!! You need a raise< /Review>

The salesmanship that I received from Kevin was that like no other! He really listened to me as a client and did his ultimate best to make me happy with my choice at Toyota. He was very knowledgeable with the vehicles and helped me chose a car best fit for me. He was very sweet and kind. I will definitely refer my friends and family to him any time they are in need of a new car! Thank you so much Kevin for your professionalism as well as helping me find exactly what I was looking for. I am in love with my car!!<//text>

Closed the deal with Artur from financial services who was also great. Then a few days later I dropped my check off to Beto (also in FS) who also turned out to be a really helpful and great as well.

SHADY!!

Bad service. charge for things that weren't completed. Def won't go back to this location

Told me my oil gasket was leaking - 500$.  Brought to another shop told there was no leak

Also they did a multi-point inspection, my transmission oil is borderline black, I guess they forgot to check that

Originally tried to charge me for a tire rotation I asked for, but then found out they didn't do the rotation anyway, yet still tried to charge me

Refunded all my money and got the oil change for free

Wont be back</text>

I never write reviews or bad reviews even, but this place sucks. I spent a long time looking for a car and getting the best deal. I made it super clear via messaging with the dealership that I work 6 days/week and have very little time. I requested to do an online credit application to get that out of the way and we settled all the numbers beforehand. It doesnt seem that they did anything with that information. Once I arrived they kept leaving me with various forms for a long time not checking on me to see if I'm finished and probably doing other tasks when they should have been sitting with me, so it ended up taking 2 hours to do a few forms. They finally did run my credit, then tell me that I need a cosigner and told me that my credit was lower than it actually is (confirmed by another dealership). Essentially after two hours of waiting, thinking I will be leaving with a car, they told me I couldn't. An absolute waste of time and a few days later I bought the same car at another dealership, no co-signer. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP.< /Text>

<Text>I brought my Toyota Tacoma in for a transmission problem. Bobby Bessera was the assigned representative and he was very helpful with addressing my cars problem. He had a service technician test drive the car with me in it so I could show them what the problem was and kept me updated with the entire process. My car was fixed in one day because he gave me priority service and I would definitely recommend Bobby to my friends. I am very happy with his performance. He is a great addition to the Toyota of Glendale.<//Text><UserId.>104154249870738012553<//UserId.><pics>None<//pics>< Name>

I was looking around for a new car last Saturday with no expectations, and I ended up being blown away by the level of service and professionalism that I received from Stephanie the Cashier. She totally went above and beyond to help me find what I needed, from snacks, to guiding me to the sales team, and she also showed me where I could buy cool Toyota stuff! Plus, I accidentally left my wallet in the bathroom, and she chased me down to give it back to me!! I will be coming back to buy my new car!!<//Text>

Jack Papazyan, the sales representative, was very courteous and knowledgeable, explained me in detail all my leasing options, and answered all my questions before and after my leasing contact.  He was a available always during my leasing 3 years, whenever I had questions. Even after lease paperwork he showed me how to setup my iPhone with the car.  I felt very welcomed, very important and very happy customer.  My second time Toyota Camry that I am leasing, I had chance to have him helping me to choose the right car both times.  Outstanding service👍.  Also during my previous free services, it happened that while I was waiting for the service being performed, I met Sahak and he was very helpful as well in explaining my early or on maturity date options👍.  And the last good service I had was at the finance office where I had chance to meet Arthur Kirakossian, and he met all the excellent financial agent criteria that I have ever experienced👍.  Of course, I’ll return to Toyota of Glendale for my future car business needs.  I highly recommend this place to those who had bad or unsatisfactory experience elsewhere.  Go to Toyota of Glendale just like you go to your home, Toyota family is waiting for you with highly experienced staff♥️.</Text>

Sahak was super helpful and gave me a lot of good information about the options available for the vehicle I was interested in. He is professional and courteous. He spoke to me like an intelligent woman instead of just talking to my husband like they do at some other auto dealerships.

I ended up leaving that night with exactly the vehicle I wanted. The process was quick and painless and I never felt pressured. The staff at Glendale Toyota are terrific. This is the third vehicle my family has purchased there in the past 4 years!</review>

When cleaning the throttle body of my car I accidently droped a tape into the air intake manifold. I immediately disconnected the battery and the throttle body control connector and towed the car to Glendale Toyota. I was greeted by  service advisor Paul Flores who took all the steps to ensure that mechanics do not start the car.
I was expecting that they will take out the air intake manifold to remove the object. Imagine my surprise when the next morning Paul called and told me that the car is ready and they were able to remove the object with inspection camera without disassembling the intake manifold.
I am very pleased with the provided service and many thanks to Paul Flores for excellent service and pleasant experience!<//Text>

<Review>Toyota of Glendale is by far the best dealership I have ever been to. They made me feel welcomed and made my car buying experience a piece of cake. I recommend Kevin and Tony. They went out of their way to get me a 2018 Toyota Camry in the color that I wanted. Not only did they order me the car that I wanted, but they also provided me with a loaner until my car arrived. They immediately contacted me when my car was ready to be picked up. No questions asked. I will definitely be back when my lease ends to buy another car from them.

Service  department is great! Ask for Carlos. I can't say the same for the sales department. If I were rating them, I'd give them 2 starts. They were very pushy and weren't listening to what I was telling them and what I wanted. I had to go to Toyota of orange to get what I wanted. Service at Glendale is a different story. I had a great experience. Fast and very straight forward.< /Review>

While the car was under warranty, all the problems I addressed to them did not exist for them, the car was not even checked. Once the warranty is over, they are willing to check everything that bothers me and admit that the problems really are there, but for the money.< /Review>

I would like to thank Mr. Peter Atmajian for his readiness to help and his professionalism. He helped me to recognize the issue with my vehicle and find the best solution. I would definitely recomend Toyota of Glendale to my family and friends.

Also lots of thanks to Andrii (the salesperson I bought my vehicle from), who helped me to schedule my appointment with Peter and who is always ready to help with any issue regarding my vehicle.<//text>

<text>I already knew the vehicles model, color and accessories that my Mom was wanting after our test drives where compleyed. so now my only task is to find the lot that had everything my mom wants and who had the better deals.
Toyota of Glendale had it all ready and just waiting for us to drive in and pick it up...which is what we did. My sister drove me to Glendale Toyota where they honored all my wish lists with the lower prices I was quoted from different dealers and all I has to do was sign and drive off with the new car, straight to Tulare where it will live in its big fancy garage owned by my Mom.  She's happy, I'm happier.<//text>< pics>

<text>This was the best dealership I've ever dealt with.  This was my fourth Prius lease in a row and I got a great deal with no haggling.  They respected my great credit score and I was in and out in under 2 hours.  My guy was Jack and I think the manager's name was Freddy and they were both great and honest, something I had not found at the other dealerships in the area.</text>< name>

They were very understanding and got my car serviced immediately. AND i had a pumpkin pie in my car for Thanksgiving and needed to put it in a fridge - one of the car guys held it in his fridge for me while my car was serviced so it wouldn't go bad sitting in my car.

My service adviser is Shane Hackelton (could be wrong on the spelling there), one of the most honest people I've ever encountered in the auto industry. I made a mistake by going to a Brake Masters when I recently needed some work done on my car. They tried to tell me that basically everything needed to be replaced. Luckily, I got my car back and called Tempe Honda.  In the end, Toyota of Glendale was able to fix my brake problems for about $300 less than Brake Masters. LOVE these people.</review>< userid>

My mom got a beautiful white 2017 Camry and couldn't be any happier with the process either. Usually car shopping is dreadful but Toyota of Glendale really left a positive impression on us. We also had the fortune of meeting and working with the Sales Manager, Tony. He was a terrific guy and went above and beyond to ensure that we left happy and with exactly what my mom wanted at the right price! Even the finance manager, Peter, was a delight to work with. I would recommend ANYONE of my family, friends, neighbors, coworkers or fellow yelpers to at least stop by, see Angel, meet Tony and let them prove to you how great they are! I am truly grateful and so is my mom. Thank you Toyota of Glendale!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>Worst dealership ever!

Live out of state, here for vacation.  Tacoma needed 42,000 service; fluids, filters that is all not even tire rotation.  Expected it would take 2 hours and cost $225 -$325.  That is what it usually cost back home.  5 hours later Tacoma ready.  Bill was almost $800!  They rotated tires even though I told them not to didn't need to be rotated.  They cleaned battery terminals which was fine but 4 weeks later dead battery.

I will never go to Glendale Toyota EVER again!  Guess having out of state plates was an invitation for rip off!  Or maybe Glendale Toyota does business this way all the time.  It took them 25 minutes to even find my Tacoma.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2c0e1a34a7c41:0x3d664b2b076ce8e3</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Toyota of Glendale is the friendliest car dealership around. They made me feel welcomed, comfortable and happy! I went in nervous as a first time car-buyer, and I walked out with a brand new car. They made it pain-free, and walked me through everything necessary for my first car-buying experience. Shoutout to Armando and Gary!</text>

I made an appointment over the chat service, which they assure me it maybe take 45 mins., I get to my appointment at 2pm 1/5/2019 they told me my car might be ready at 5pm! My car is only an oil change and when I made my appointment they had many times available for oil change. They first guy I talk to was extremely rude and unprofessional. Safe your money and time and go anywhere else but this place.<//Text>

<user>101728133570862133444</user><Review>These people lied about what was wrong with my car and then quoted an absurdly high price to fix it.  Then, as if that wasn’t bad enough, they reset the codes from my check engine light after i said i’d take my car to a different mechanic WITHOUT asking me- so my mechanic wasn’t able to see the data from cleared codes. You know how people are always afraid of mechanics and dealers taking advantage of them because they dont know enough about whats wrong with their car to talk back to them?  Well these guys are the ones you have to worry about because they tried it with me.  Don’t go here!</Review>< time>

I went surfing with my 2017 Highlander key in my wetsuit because I’m a genius, or maybe Dad brain (2 babies under 15 months). Making time to replace the key at the dealer was tough to fit between naptimes and baby meltdowns.
I called last weekend to order a replacement Key and they scheduled me first thing the following Saturday. The service manager was great. They had the new key programmed within 2 hours.
On my way home I noticed they only gave me one piece of the key. When I called back, I was surprised to find out there is a valet key that is supposed to be ordered separately. I was a little frustrated knowing I would have to go through the whole process over again.
The service manager acknowledged they should have mentioned there are 2 parts and agreed to order the valet key immediately and take care of it by Monday.
It is great to work with people who are conscientious of your time and effort. I greatly appreciate it.</Text>

I removed two stars because Service manager Jimmy Cote was let go. He was one of the best service people who knew what he was doing. He treats you like his uncle and does good follow up and explanation. I was surprised by the new people I see. I was standing by my car and nobody seems to notice me for 10 minutes. Looks like this company just pluck people from anywhere and replaced experienced personnel.</Text>

I cannot say enough good things about the service at Toyota of Glendale. When you buy a car at Toyota of Glendale you not only purchase a quality vehicle, you also get service above and beyond what you might find at other dealers. Ara Terizian is extremely knowledgeable and professional.< /Text>

<user_name>Dan K< /user_name><Time>1567547316794</Time><Rating>1< /Rating><review>1st visit:
Came in to get a tire replaced since I have tire insurance with toyota. They told me my tires didnt qualify and that I had to pay out of pocket. I had to argue with them to convince them it was covered. Then they said they had to order the tire and told me to come in 2 days later. When I arrived, they said the tire still needed to be ordered. I literally had to drive back 3 times to get 1 tire replaced. Then I literally waited 4 hours for them to replace 1 tire because they weren't willing to expedite.

2nd visit:
Came in to get another tire replaced. They said the tire was in stock. When I came in, they said nope, nevermind, not in stock. I came back 2 days later as they requested. Of course, the tires are not here yet. They said to come back. Then, when I returned, they fixed it, but of course, with the wrong tire. Seriously? How many things can they get wrong?

I really dont understand how much they can mess up something so simple.< /review>< Pictures>

Got a great car!  I was just looking, but after meeting Narek and seeing the new Corolla Hatchback I decided to go for it.  Then Freddie got involved and I got an incredible deal.  I never felt "sold".  We walked out completely happy.  These guys are real problem solvers.  I will recommend you  to my friends.< /review>

<review>Worst experience I've had with any kind of dealer.I had a recall on my car and went to fix it, I ended up with missing car parts and a damaged radio. From the first moment I stepped into the dealership, up until I left with my car - I have witnessed an insane amount of unprofessional, disrespectful, and careless employees. From the beginning, the receptionist, Paul, never picked up the phone. The shuttle only gives you 5 miles around the dealer, and the waiting time for the shuttle was over an hour. I ended up waiting in the dealership for my car for 3 and half hours. During this time, I tried calling Paul many times to know the status of my car, and I saw him ignore the phone and letting it go to voicemail. After I received my car, I noticed that the car is extremely dirty and messy from the inside, moreover the RADIO WAS BROKEN. Paul tried to fix it, but it didn't work. I met with the assistant manager, Peter Atmajian,  to discuss the broken radio as well as the missing parts of the car and he said since I took it out of the lot, it wasn't their responsibility anymore, and regarding the missing parts, he said that some cars come with missing pieces and that my car was one of them. I explained to him that the radio was working perfectly before they took the car, but he didn't take responsibility. Peter Atmajian was very careless and rude, completely unprofessional to be a candid for the well-renowned Toyota brand. I tired to speak with Carlos Bena , the manager, but he was unwilling to help as well, more over he offer me abusiness card for another person his name is Robert Barahona to wave him his troubles. I believe this is because of laziness and not wanting to get out of his office. I don't recommend for anyone, if you make a mistake, and decide to go - check that all the car pieces are there and expect to be ignored, and expect your car to come back messy and damaged.< /review>< UserId.>

George Huerta is the best advisor in the service department!

2018 Update: George is no longer there but if you visit or call to schedule an appointment at this Toyota... ask for Wilson Del Castillo.

He is super knowledgeable, efficient, friendly and always provides the best customer service. You won't regret it!!!!< /Review>

Because of the warranty, you are required to use their service department for an oil change and maintenance. Otherwise I would definitely go somewhere else.
First off when you get there, you are required to make an appointment for another day, they won't even try to work it out. Now it's 2 days you have to take time off from work.
Next, we showed up on our appointment time, and it took 45 minutes for them to  check the car into the shop. Then proceeded to inform me that it would take 3 hours to finish an oil change.
So we decided to take a shuttle they provide to the Glendale Galleria mall which is only 1 mile away. It took them an hour for the driver to get back and take us there. We were in the mall for about 2 hours and the said the car was done and where should the shuttle pick us up at. The same place they dropped us off at, of course. The driver got lost and picked us up an hour after they left the dealership. Again only 1 mile away.
Customer service should anticipate your needs and take care of everything before it becomes noticeable.
Their customer service is retroactive. Meaning the customer is not happy, and they try to fix it after it is already frustrating them. This is down to the register, which there is only one place to pay for something. The waiting area is almost as depressing as the DMV. Some people had been there for over 6 hours.
If you can, avoid falling into the trap of having to use the service department. Even if it means not buying from them.<//Text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>My wife and I bought two brand new Rav4's there this weekend and had the absolute pleasure of dealing with Eric. We did a lot of research before going in and shopped around several places first. We came in with a very low number. They were the one of the few dealerships out of many that said they would work with our number and didn't ignore our emails after sending in our expected price. Of course we had to come to an agreement, and our number ended up a little higher than what we went in with, but it was within our expected range and we never once felt like we were being up-sold options or extras we didn't want. We never felt pressured or dissuaded from our goal. The negotiation process was easy, fair, and explained transparently all the way through to the finance office. And Eric was the kind of salesperson who you really feel like is on your side when he leaves to talk to a manager. In the end, we feel like we got a very fair price. Neither we nor the dealership got taken advantage of. We got two beautiful new cars, with all the features we wanted, and no annoying up-charges for silly things like a bumper decal. Everybody won. I highly recommend Toyota of Glendale and I highly recommend speaking with Eric. But as you should always... do your research on exactly what you want and what it should cost, so when you go in to buy it makes it easier on everyone. That will help your negotiation experience immensely and it will help the salesperson help you. Happy car shopping!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Excellent service.  Although it took 1 1/2 hours to service my car, the service person made up to me by giving me a discount.  Courteous staff too.< /Review>

I've known Edwin and Liza for a while now. We always recommend them to our relatives and friends and all of them who bought their toyotas with them are all satisfied. We've been  to a lot of dealerships before but with Edwin and Liza is by far the very best buying experience we've ever had. Unlike any other salespersons who give you the run around they give you straight talk and honest deals. I will surely recommend them to anyone who would want to buy a car. Thanks Edwin and Liza<//Text>

<text>Read all the fine print of your lease agreement, if you return the vehicle and do not purchase from them, they will charge you 350.00  to dispose your vehicle, also any minor wear and tear, will be charge no matter what. got a bill for 650.00 and the vehicle had a minor dent less than the size of a credit card. Basically at the end of the lease, buy your lease or lease another vehicle from them, so that they will waived the 350 disposition fee. No salesman explained that to me. , of course I believe there is nothing free, they will probably hide the fee somewhere into your new contract., but at lease you have the idea that you did not pay. They have a terrible bad practice of getting everything fast, to confuse you, be careful</text>< response>

<Text>I FINALLY GOT A NEW CAR :) It was long overdue but not having a monthly car payment is so nice! I wanted to get a Prius as I was spending so much money in gas on my old SUV that I wanted a ride that would get me from point A to point B a little bit faster.

My experience here ended up being great too! The customer service was so good! Sometimes car shopping is stressful because of how much pressure the sales reps make you feel but not here! Everyone was upper chill and helpful throughout the process.

Go visit these guys if you are looking for a transparent and smooth car buying experience!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I have owned my RAV4 for 13 months, and I visited Toyota for maintenance of 20,000 miles.
The person who helped me explained what the service was going to be, and what service would be the next service. The service took almost the time he estimated, and the condition of my car was perfect. Also, he gave me some information of promotion about extended service plan. I will purchase the extended service for up to 45,000 mile at the next visit because it is good deal for customers. Overall, I was truly satisfied the service at the Toyota Glendale.< /Text>

While all dealers are learning to change and adapt to the Amazon Way Of Life, these neanderthals are still stuck on the old ways. I go there with my wife to buy a starter car for my daughter as a surprise. The salesperson (at least that's what he thinks he is) insisted that before I go for a test drive, I needed to bring my daughter there! REALLY! Seriously?!?!? Needless to say, I walked away and let him know he was not getting my business. Oh and they started telemarketing me the next day :(</Text>

Came here to drive/buy 2016 Tacoma 4x4, manual transmission.  Sticker price was 34,900.

We got to dealership in the evening after making an appointment in the morning and they found the truck up on the roof with a paper in the window that said 'sold'.  So the guy left to talk to his manager, came back with a key and said we could drive it and buy it if we want it.

So we took it out for a drive, came back and were ready to purchase the truck at the sticker price of 34, 900.

We sit at the table and the salesman walks over with a paper and on the paper he says we can buy the truck for 37,900.  WHAT???

They argue with us saying that the truck is already sold to someone else but they will sell it to us for the higher price if we want it.   Then tried to use purchasing a house, best offer wins tactic also saying that there will be no more sticks for this truck.

We walked out and WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN.  We bought a Honda Accord the next day, fully loaded for well under the sticker price.  This dealership was HORRIBLE and really deserves ZERO stars.</Text>

Got my car fixed here when I got into a small accident. The service rep was very friendly and did a great job in keeping me up to date on the status of my car. The only downside is that labor and the part was more expensive than other places I've been too.</review>

Vultures, from the moment you step out of your car the salesmen are in your face and won't let you just look around for a few minutes without asking you for your phone number and email address. If you make the mistake of giving it to them they will harass you with calls, texts and emails.
We picked a car and sat down to do the paperwork to find they snuck in a bunch of hidden charges making my payment go up much higher than just the cost of the car and interest. They treat you as if you can't do basic math and won't notice the extra charges packed into your payment. We found that they tacked on $1800. for a extended warrantee, $1100. for gap insurance (my insurance company gave that to us for $400), $800. for a after market alarm, tire hazard protection for $950. There were so many hidden charges it drove our monthly payment up an extra $86.25 a month for things they did not tell us they were charging us for and did not ask for. When I asked about them they acted as if this was standard and on all new vehicles, when I asked if I had to purchase them they said yes it is part of the new vehicle package (THAT IS A LIE).
I eventually walked out and ended up buying a different car at a different dealer. Honestly the worst experience I have had buying any of the 11 cars I previously purchased other places.
Also the salesmen we has looked like a low life with a bunch of tattoos and spoke with slang, very unprofessional. When buying a car it is a major purchase in most peoples lives and you will be making these payments for 5 years so its something you want done by a respectable person who does not rip you off. These people are what give salesmen a bad name and a disgrace to the profession.</text>

Stopped by on a cross country trip and had a great experience. There is always that feeling when you're taking your car for service out of town that you could possible get taken advantage of, to the contrary these folks had better pricing than I find at home. Too bad they aren't my local service provider!< /text>

I asked the guy to check and order the tires and then asked the service department to make an appointment.  A day before the appointment I called to reconfirm the appointment and if the tires are ready.  But they haven’t done anything and even the appointment wasn’t placed.  The person many times told me that you must have called another TOYOTA dealer while I have a call history at my phone.   Maybe they don’t care such a tiny business like the tire install.  I will go to the tire store and never ask TOYOTA dealers.</Review>

Efficient and friendly, but there can be a bottleneck in picking up your car after service and paying.  Last time I waited nearly 20 mins for my vehicle.  2 people who paid after me received their cars and were long gone by the time I got mine.</Text>

Excessively expensive "service". I had bought filters to do my own oil change and air filter replacements but ended up not having the free time to do it. I brought it into the service center explained that I had purchased the parts already and I needed the oil changed, filters replaced (engine and cabin), tires rotated and a quick inspection of the CV joints. $120 later including tax and everything is done... I might expect $120 with parts included but what amounts to a 30 minute oil change and tire rotation is ridiculous. On top of that I was told my truck was ready 30 minutes early and when I arrived I waited 15 minutes and say them take my truck off the rack and drive it out.
Bottom line, you will wait 15 minutes for someone to approach you when you bring in your car, you will wait 15 minutes to pick up your car, pay an excessive amount in service charges and they don't wash your car after paying through the nose...< /Text>

<Review>Horrible waste of time. I was told they had a vehicle ready for me to test drive and when I show up they said it was sold 5 hours before I made the phone call... So why the **** was I told they had it in stock. On top of that management doesn't care. How can I work with a company that doesn't care.

Bathrooms are disgusting, show room is crowded and most of all a waste of time.

Next time I'd rather go to North Hollywood Toyota.<//Review>< user>

Henry Saunders, the service writer is the best service guy I've ever had. Conscientious, kept me up to date on the progress and didn't recommend things to be done that were in good shape - a MAJOR problem I had with North Hollywood Toyota.
I recently had a very elusive electrical problem in my 2000 Tacoma. An on and off misfire that was hard to track down. Before I took it to Glendale Toyota I had an independent change the plugs, then the plug wires and coils. Still misfired. At this point I figured I better take this problem to someone who knows only Toyotas. I went online, checked out reviews on the dealers in my area and only Glendale had good reviews. I took it in on Monday morning and got Henry. first off they found out that the indie guy had put the wrong plugs in. They corrected that and then went on the hunt for the electrical problem. They worked with it until they managed to get a code. The code traced back to an injector. They corrected the problem and returned my truck in great working order. I couldn't be happier. Can't go wrong with Henry, best service writer ever!<//review>

You book an appointment for an oil change so you can wait 3 hours for a 20 minute job and then wait an hour for the cashier to print a piece of paper even though you paid for an overpriced service plan.

They bend over backwards until you buy a car and then proceed to bend you over while you pay them.<//review>

I came in asking about the new Prius. Salesperson was really knowledgeable about the changes to this model year. Other dealerships weren't as much. I'm still contemplating my purchase but when I do, I will come here!</Text>

<Review>Five stars for George alone. I got my Prius serviced here, and it was totally standard wait time and conditions--but the staff was peppy, helpful, and checked up on me numerous times to make sure my experience was satisfactory. Getting your car serviced is always a bit of a pain, but the people at Toyota of Glendale make it a little bit better!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I'm a Toyota owner since January, 2000. Since then I owned 6 different Models of Toyota. I do maintenance only with Toyota of Glendale. Last time I visit Toyota of Glendale on September 11, 2020. The representative of Toyota of Glendale Service Department was Ara. He was professional, courteous, and he had positive energy. I would definitely recommend George Huerta to my family and friends.</Text>

Just called the service department. The manager should make a call him/her self and listen to how the girls talk to their customers!! I have no choice but to go here since it is close to my work.  If the manager of Glendale Toyota is reading this please either you learn how to be a manager or train your staff of how to talk to the customers.  Without us you won't even have a job.   I have always gone to Peter at the Service department. He always know his stuff and is very professional!!</text>

<review>Great experience! My sales representative, J.R. (Norberto) Miranda, was very helpful, knowledgeable, and not pushy at all. Ask for him if you go! I felt that all my questions were answered and that I was able to evaluate all my choices, including cars at other dealerships, and make a good decision. I'm very excited about my new lease on a 2016 Toyota Prius. Because I had my old car with me, J.R. helped me get the car back home and find good options for resale.  I'd also say that the finance manager, Peter Benarbashian, and the floor manager, Jerome Washington, were also very kind and friendly.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Super hungry salespersons. Ran my parents credit over and over. "Managers" were rude when discussing options to exchange new vehicle. Toyota liaison never followed up. They will bend backwards to sell you the car but you're on your own once you drive off.<//review>< pics>

<Review>I love this dealership. After leaving the Santa Monica area where I usually took my Toyota to Toyota of Santa Monica, it was not easy finding a Toyota dealer that I liked. Glendale has been very friendly and helpful and all of the service writers there that I have dealt with have been exceptional. I have worked in the dealerships for many years and I know the tricks of the trade, but these people are genuine and helpful, their technicians are awesome, they took time to diagnose a tail light problem for me with out charging me and with out much of a wait just to see if it was necessary for me to schedule and appointment for the problem. The assembly was shorted out due to water from the broken lense, they replaced it and it wasn't too expensive and they were speedy about it and stayed in contact the whole time.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Purchased a new black TRD PRO 4Runner from Glendale last week. Very happy with my purchase. James Awh, the salesman, and Fred McDaniels, the manager, were very courteous and knowledgeable. James and Fred we’re not pushy in the least and I ended up with something better than I expected. Highly recommend them.< /text>

The best buying experience I ever had for a car.  They took care of me.  My credit score was in rough shape and they helped me get a good interest rate, as well as great advice to clean up my score and in 5 months, I've risen my score by 100 points.  They were upfront and honest, we had to barter and go back and forth, like you do with any sale but we had fun, kept it light and they really took care of me.  The original sales agent who showed me around, stopped to help me when I came in, as he was going on his lunch break and then stayed with me for 6 hours.  I'm a tough customer, but never once did he ever get angry or "hangry," not once.  His name is Brian, he was great, he kept me there and took care of me.<//review>

Went in for scheduled maintenance...oil change friday morning. Wait was not long and service people were friendly and helpful. Only downside is no car wash...assumed that was always done as complimentary...guess its not so make sure to ask for one!< /text>

< Review>
On Friday, Oct 3, 2014 I took my Prius to Toyota of Glendale for an intermediate service. Service advisor was Mr. Cote. He took care of the service in a very professional manner. The service was done in two hours. I told him the charger in the console did not work. He called me and let me know that there was a coin inside. The technician took it out and now it works perfectly.
Overall, it was a pleasant experience< /Review>

Well, do come to this dealership for service or repair. They E-mail me the discount coupon $25 dollars off and free windshield blade when doing a service. they charged $259 dollars for service only includes air intake, oil change. And the other dealers offering 89-99 for that kind of service, so you end up paying about 150 dollars more. The worst part is that the service guys are always in a hurry, never answer your question or tell something that are not true. I bought my 2 cars here, and decided do my first service here, guess what, i will never have any kind of business relation with this dealership ever.<//review>

Friendly approach by our sales Rep. named Kevin, no pressure at any moment, kind, professional and truly exceptional customer service by everyone that helped. Tony, one of the floor managers gave us the opportunity to negotiate and most of all help us with a great deal! (Viva el America!) Toyota of Glendale is our family # 1 choice, we started with a 4Runner,  then a Prius, and recently a Tacoma SR5.

We strongly recommend Toyota of Glendale!<//Text>

<Review>Never even got in the door.  Tried to call multiple times, around noon on a Saturday.  Their answering machine would pick up and disconnect me.  Or would pick up, speak for about 20 second, then put me on hold and then disconnect me.  Okay, I'll just go to a different dealership.  If the customer service is so crappy that they can't afford people to answer phone, I dread to think what the actual person-to-person customer service is like.  Yikes!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Stay away from this place! They will scam you! A little over a month after getting my car and purchasing a vehicle service agreement with Toyota of Glendale I got a letter Toyota financial services saying that the service agreement purchased did not qualify for my car. I've been trying to contact the financial services guy named Beto at Glendale who sold it to me. I finally was able to speak to him after calling for a month and each time being told he was with a customer. When I finally talked to him he was rude, said he had a bunch of files on his desk and he didn't have time to call me back, then said he did call me back but I didn't answer. So I asked him why he didn't leave a message and he said he didn't have time. Anyway during that phone call he said that he's been back and forth with corporate about why the plan didn't quality and that this has happened with dozens of other people. He promised to get back to me within a week. That was a month and a half ago. I finally found the time to call corporate myself and they said the plan number they had on the application isn't a plan number at all which is why they aren't sure what plan they actually sold me AND they also said that they have never had any correspondence with Beto or anyone else from Toyota of Glendale. The kind gentleman at corporate suggested that I open a case with corporate customer relations to open up an investigation. Save yourself months worth of headache, worry, stress, and anger and DO NOT BUY YOUR CAR HERE. They're either scammers or don't know what they're doing.< /review><Date>1532384563507<//Date>< UserId.>

I usually never write bad reviews but I’m so tired of Toyota service department having such crappy customer service especially since I’ve been a customer for years! When I first dropped my car off to get a routine service I waited for 10 mins before someone even acknowledged me. I asked the service advisor if I could add a car wash as well and he laughed in my face and said “this isn’t a car wash.” BTW, every single Toyota I’ve been to offers paid (used to be free) car wash options, but okay no need to be rude. At first I decided to wait there and work on my laptop but the WiFi wasn’t working and the waiting room was dirty, so after about 5 minutes I decided to sign up for the complimentary shuttle instead. I realized I had left my house key on my set of keys and when I asked if I could get them before they took the car back they said no because they were “already working on my car” and that it would be done in the next 15 mins. LOL even though there were about 5 cars in front of me. Luckily, the shuttle driver waited for me but I had to beg them for my keys back. The service advisor NEVER called me to let me know if I needed any additional work done on the car or if I was okay with them performing additional replacements (which they did anyways), he only called once the car was ready, which was BTW about 2 hours later which I expected. When I returned for my car, again no direction as to where to go, no one asked if I needed help or anything. I can’t wait to sell my car and be DONE with Toyota! Was considering buying another Toyota since I love my car but I will definitely not, just so I don’t have to deal with them again.< /Text>

<Review>BE CAREFUL!  BAIT AND SWITCH!  BAIT AND SWITCH!  My girlfriend contacted Lisa Charles through the AAA website on a 2002 Toyota Corolla that was advertised for $5,399.  She asked her for the AAA discounted price, and Lisa said that my girlfriend needed to come in and show her AAA card as a company policy, and they will give my girlfriend the Kelley Blue Book value on the car which sounded fair enough.  My girlfriend made the appointment with Lisa, assuming she knew which car my girlfriend wanted.  When my girlfriend arrived, Lisa took her to the back office outside the main office, didn't show her the car, and asked about credit information and ran my girlfriend's credit.  When my girlfriend asked about the car from the AAA website, Lisa seemed to not know anything about it, but instead, Lisa, offered the more expensive 2007 or higher models.  Basically, it was a waste of my girlfriend's time.  Lisa didn't want to disclose any information and started telling my girlfriend that the AAA discount only applies to the newer models, basically completely ignoring all my girlfriend's questions about the car that she wanted from the website.</Review>< Pictures>

I have been coming to this specific location for the last 2 years! I will only work with Wilson and go on days he is working. It's very rare to find a service guy that is up front and honest. I trust Wilson with my car and what he tells me including prices. I had my car for a long time and I was ready to get a new one. I was gonna change it up and get a Honda. However, it's because of Wilson that I stayed with Toyota and just got a 2017 T prius!</text>

<Text>I really like the service department especially Wilson Del Castillo.  Ever since I've met Wilson, I don't work with anyone else.  I make my appt with Wilson and never have to wait more than 10 mins to drop off or pick up.  If you live or work near the Glendale area I would highly recommend going to Wilson for all your service needs as he will take good care of you.

Both times I've been to this dealership I've had a bad experience. Not sure if the dealership is completely to blame because in general I've had a poor service experience with Toyota. That said, I'm definitely never using this dealership again.<//Text>

This place sucks! We  got our hopes up on leasing a Toyota Camry and waited 4 hours going through the process purchasing this vehicle. They had us sign some forms, asked for our insurance, take copies of our drivers license and told us our car was being washed and gas tank was being filled up .... Only to be told " sorry we are unable to finance this car to you" due to their negligence to running the credit check prior to the 4 long hours of negotiations . Just an fyi, check clients credit prior to moving forward with any deal .So unprofessional and a waste of my time. They had no compassion as they gave us false hopes.<//text>

I've been a Honda owner on my last 7 cars. But the Toyota Prius features and gas mileage were leaps and bounds over all of Honda's hybrids I had to convert to Toyota. Because of Toyota's reputation for reliability and efficiency I'll be a loyal customer to Toyota as I was with Honda. The 2 year maintenance and 2 year roadside assistance program was a huge bonus, my wife asked me what took us so long to join the Toyota family. She loves her new Prius, I've never seen her so excited about a new car this is her 3rd new car.</Text>

<review>A very easy going experience.  I never felt pressured or hassled.  My wife and I originally came in just to do a test drive (we knew of a much better deal at another dealership 80 miles away) and when we openly told this to Anna, she explained that she could work with us on the price if we liked this car.  After leaving the dealership and thinking about what price we would be willing to pay for the cars she showed us, I texted her my offer and we negotiated a reasonable price and trade-in deal completely via text-message!

I should also mention Eddie who did our document prep work.  Eddie was very nice and cordial, not trying to up-sell us on anything and explaining every very well.  Overall if all used-dealer experiences were this easy I don't think people would dread buying cars nearly as much as they do.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

<review>What a horrible experience we had tonight at this dealership! My brother and I walked in with a mindset to walk out with a new car! We were looking at the CRV hybrid all wheel drive. We walk to the parking lot and this is where it all goes downhill!! A sales representative (Jonny Pita) walked up to us and asked us what we wanted. Right off the bat he wasn't a pleasing person and he had a negative attitude about him! Being in sales for over 7 years and leading a sales team, customer service and a good attitude is extremely important! Jonny was very unhelpful and barely answered any of our questions! Asked him to show us another car and he simply said walk there and see it.... this dealership definitely lost a sell and a few customers as I would never let any of my family or friends to even think about going to this dealership! Fix your sales representatives' attitudes or lose even more customers!</review><username>Aden Kh</username><resp>None</resp></record>

<Review>I had such a wonderful experience leasing my car through Toyota of Glendale! I specifically dealt with Mario (Sales) and Beto (Finance) and they were super friendly, straight-forward, transparent and a pleasure to do business with. I am not an easy person to please when it comes to car shopping because I am very picky when it comes to service (I have a background in the service industry and sales) and price (I do a lot of research and have bargained with numerous dealerships for previous purchases).

To give you an idea of how my experience went down, here is the background story: Around Xmas, I decided that I wanted to lease a 2017 Prius from a dealership in LA so I called 8 different dealerships and asked for their most competitive pricing. What really stood out about the response I received from Toyota of Glendale (I cannot remember the name of the woman who helped me over the phone, I am sorry!), was that on our very first call, they asked me what I wanted to pay and then went to their manager and got me their very best pricing. It was super simple and there was no sales-y sliminess involved. I felt they were honest in that they had given me their best and I also confirmed it. The reason why I know that it was absolutely their very best pricing is because I called all the other dealerships back who I had been on the phone with multiple times in negotiation and no one would come back with a price that was lower than Toyota of Glendale.

I immediately set up an appointment and headed in to lease my new Prius. That's where I met Mario. Mario is a super sweet, super knowledgeable salesman who let me see everything they had available cracked funny jokes with me while I was in the shopping process. I felt he was super approachable and again, I did not get a weird/slimy sales-y vibe that I have so frequently encountered with car salesmen.

After doing paperwork and deciding on my specific car, I was then passed along to Beto who works in finance. He was also a super friendly guy who explained the whole process of leasing to me and was able to get me a stellar deal on the extra vehicle coverage. He made a long, often painful process light-hearted and fun.

Overall, I really enjoyed leasing my 2017 Prius from Toyota of Glendale. I will definitely be going back there for service and any future call leasing or purchases. I have already recommended Toyota of Glendale to my friends/family/acquaintances and will continue to do so :)</Review><Response>None<//Response>< user_name>

If you think that you got a good deal from Toyota of Glendale? I think there’s a good chance you got ripped off and don’t even know it. Here’s one way you can find out. Go out to your car, look at the edges of the doors and the inside of the door handles. Do you see a thin layer of plastic film? That’s called ‘door edge protection’ and ‘door cup protection’. These items are good to have on your car and they will protect the paint, but they should only cost you about $50 or so, if you put it on yourself. If you pay someone to do it, it might cost around $200. Toyota of Glendale charges you over $1,700. Why would anyone pay for that? Because, Toyota of Glendale tries to hide the cost from you when you deal with them.  If you ask about anything being added to the car, like I did, they lie to your face. In fact, if you’re talking to Gerome Wasshington, whatever words are coming out of his mouth are probably a lie. I asked what was causing the difference between the manufacturer’s MSRP and the final cost, and he assured me that it was entirely DMV related fees and financing costs due to my credit score, which to be honest is barely in the ‘good’ range these days (but thankfully getting better each month). I assumed because of my credit no being what it was, that I would pay a little more than what Toyota had advertised for the lease promotion. So, I bought into Gerome’s lie. Also note that the finance guy is supposed to confirm any deal added extras with you before you sign. The person I dealt with did not do this. Toyota of Glendale is a den of crooks. If you don’t believe me go look at you Bill of Sale and your car and decide for yourself. If you would like to make a complaint to Toyota corporate office, as I did, please include ‘Toyota of Glendale – Paint Protection Scam’ in the subject. I’m dealing with ‘James S.’ there. If you are about to buy a car, only go here if you enjoy getting ripped off and lied to.</Review>

Awful service. All service agents are irrensponsible including General Manager that in order to cover employees bad service promised to send me a gift card and did not. If General Manager is not reliable person, how could we expect from Employees? Very disappointed with their customer service and never keeping schedule and time for car maintenance. Several time had the same issue.< /text>

our toyota is leased and we took it into get it services and all that. A week later we have a tire pressure signal come on and we go to the gas station to try and fill it but nothing's working. We figured we could just pop into toyota real quick and have them just give us air and check the pressure. We got there and they told us we have to wait since we don't have an appointment and there were other cars ahead of us. We told them we just needed air real quick and we would be out. No help and crappy customer service. Thanks so helping your customers in need.< /text>

Toyota of Glendale is an amazing organization! They have a huge selection of new and pre-owned/certified verhicles at the dealership not to mention very competitive pricing as they're willing to beat other dealers' lowest price. The staff and Sales Team are exceptional as they are knowledgeable, friendly, courteous, and are just true professionals in the automotive sales industry. I am very happy and proud to say that I had recently purchased a brand new Toyota from this dealership. The entire purchase experience was world class,  refreshing and simply amazing.  My Toyota of Glendale sales manager, Lidiya Galstyan is the best in the business! She took good care of me from pre-sale, during sale, and post sale support. I love my Toyota and I can't wait for my next purchase from this dealership. As a Quality Professional, i can tell you that Toyota of Glendale is your source for high quality vehicles and services. Please see Lidiya and she will take good care of You!<//Text>

<Text>This review is only regarding the shuttle service. After waiting for 1.5 hour for the shuttle, I went to ask when the shuttle will be back, and was told that I have to wait for another 30 min! I could have just walked home and get home earlier if I knew it would take so long to get the shuttle service. The worst part is that if I didn't ask, I wouldn't know I had to wait so long. Looks like this Toyota dealership has no courtesy to tell the customers what they will face.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>I bought a thermostat for my 07 Camry around 04/17 and used it until 08/17.... I asked Toyota of Glendale Parts department, how come it lasted only for 4 months... so parts department told me it has a 1 year warranty and gave me a new one... after installation of the new one, I still have the same problem... what do you think? Is it a coincidence? Or they gave me recycled parts from their repair shop... supposedly an OEM parts... right? The part costs $30 only but the labor and hassle is making me disappointed... now I was thinking I should have gotten one from Autozone or O'reily with a lifetime warranty... for sure this uneccessary expense and hassle should NOT have happened... Now, I don't trust Toyota of Glendale parts department and/or people who works there... I got a feeling in my guts that they're recycling used parts in that location... I can tell, the packaging is NOT in original package... they have some dis-honest people working in that location... I'm so disappointed... Warning for you guys... if buying a part for your Toyota or having it serviced in that location, you might be the next victim...<//Text><UserId.>117198006653721827493< /UserId.><rate>1<//rate><gmapID>0x80c2c0e1a34a7c41:0x3d664b2b076ce8e3< /gmapID>< Resp>

<text>I was shopping Southern California Dealers for a 2012 Toyota Prius IV. Chad at Toyota of Glendale called me with a low price with no hassle. When I drove there with my wife and new baby, as promised, Chad got me in and out of the place within 45 mins.

Sal the finance gentlemen was extremely polite and not pushy. The entire staff at Toyota of Glendale is professional and what a dealership should be. Thank you. I look forward to doing business again.

<rate>1<//rate><text>TOYOTA OF GLENDALE DOES BAIT AND SWITCH TACTICS- BUY YOUR CAR SOMEWHERE ELSE!!! Toyota of Glendale promised us many upgrades to the car then did not honor it. We came in on the Costco Car Program so the price of the car was already set so instead of negotiating the price we asked for additional upgrades. Each time the sales person came back telling us they could do it the price did go up but only incrementally. It was only after we left the dealership tat we realized we had been full price for the upgrades. We brought it up to the Costco Program they were able to negotiate some of the pricing back to us, when we inquired about an additional concern Costco reluctantly informed us that they are no longer doing business with Toyota of Glendale. Toyota of Glendale claims it was their decision to terminate the agreement with Costco.. Yeah right who doesn't like an association with Costco!! I'll tell you who, businesses who are doing devious practices.< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Toyota of Glendale has the worst service department from customer service to the machinics who perform the service. I will never bring my car there again. Its all about making money and not performing the work with any pride and its almost a risk that they might actually damage something else with the car. I would not recomend this dealership for any car service<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Bad Service, I know this is not Infiniti, but anyways you spect a good service, I had an appointment  at 1 pm , came in for 5k service, and I approached to a drive thru line and wait for someone  to approach and help, nobody approach, and I just heard employees cursing and joking around,  I went down. My car and ask if someone can help me, as I had 15 min waiting for someone to come in, someone told me to wait that someone will be with me in a minute, someone came in and give me a ticket and that Saul will be with me in a little , I wait 20 min nobody was coming,  so I went to the main office and I ask for Saul, they how me to Saul office, we're he told me they were busy and apologize , okay whatever, I want to leave my car because it seems will take 3 hours to make an oil change, I told him that ls fine, can you give a shuttle , yes go to the office and they wi set you up there, I went with some lady, that told me write down your name and address, and how many mIles from there, whatever they only do 5 miles, infiniti that I also have a car with  them do also 5 miles but they will go, an extra mile for your client, the lady when to talk to Saul, and then she came back with him, and Saul told me that they don't do shuttles to Las Vegas, I was lik??? Is that suppose to be a Joke, I'm going to Burbank, 8.2 miles  away,  he said he will have try to have it in an hour to wait, I ask if they can take me at least to nearest mall, and they said will take 45 min to get the shuttle, I suppose this service is the service they provide,  I'm not use to this but, is a headache,  next time I will definitely go , to another toyota place.<//review>

<text>If people make a business than Gary Bennis the internet and fleet manager makes this company shine! We are Costco buyers and even though he was not the sales person originally assigned to us, he took us on and was very attentive.
He patiently took us through the Costco pricing and then out to look at the vehicles. We actually ended up changing our selection while on the lot and Gary just made it happen within the financial parameters we specified.
The accountant was also extremely helpful in getting the paperwork filled out in a timely manner.
As we were getting ready to drive away, Gary showed my wife (it's her Venza) how to pair her smart phone to the built-in phone system. It was way above the call of duty! He had is gassed, detailed and ready for us to go!
Awesome Experience!< /text>< pictures>

The best place to get your new toyota.

I called on July 1 to check up on their inventory. Lydia picked up the phone and answered couple of my questions.

I was thinking about going to another dealership at first. But after talking with Lydia. I said why not. I went over to the dealership. Seemed pretty quiet as no sales rep approched me as I looked at some vehicles prior meeting Lydia in person. I went into the office and asked for her. She came down and greeted me and introduced me to Ashley.

Ashley will definitely take car of you. She is very patient and understanding.

I asked her about the vehicle I would like to check out. We walked around the inventory parking garage to look for it. Couldnt find it. She found out where the vehicle was and brought it out for the test drive.

I told Ashley about another deal that another dealer had. She asked me for the information so she would take care of it.

The team Ashley works with is the best. I started the purchase and met Sam. He came out with he price of the vehicle.

It blew my mind. The price was better than the advertisement that I saw at the other dealsrships website.

Sam laid out the cost for financing the vehicle and warranty for me to review. He didnt push me into buying other things I didnt need. He just said if you dont need you dont need it.

Then I was sent over to Peter in finance. All the documents I reviewed with Ashley and Sam was exact. Nothing changed or added. They way I wanted was laid out. I went through the paperwork without any issues. Signed off the contracts.

One major problem I had was. I went there by myself. I am unable to take 2 cars home. Ashley said that she will take care of it. Since I live close enough.  She went ahead and dropped off my vehicle to my home.

Ashley will take care of you. Just show her what you researched and send it to her. Done. You dont have to worry about anything else.

Ashley. Lydia. Sam. Peter. You guys are the best.<//text>

I made my husband to make an appointment to change out the brakes on black Friday because Toyota of Glendale sent me e-coupons.  Told him not to miss it because I was interested in the 25% savings or two free tickets to Knotts Berry Farm.  Since we have going to the shop quite often since the 2008 Sienna was having problems the guys knew us.  So, instead of two tickets to Knotts, he gave us four so that my whole family could go.  How awesome is that?!?  Not only we had good service and the van was taken care of, we get to go to Knotts for Xmas!!  Whoo hoo!!<//text>

My experience at Toyota of Glendale was positive.  Our salesperson was Cecille Benitez.  We just bought a 2014 Toyota Prius.  The whole time Cecille gave us quality customer service.  A coupled of issues did arise but they were taken care of by the dealer.  I am completely happy with my experience at Toyota of Glendale.  This is my second time buying a car at this dealer.  I highly recommend Cecille Benitez as your salesperson.<//text>

One of my friends lost her keys after dropping her kids off at school, I called toyota of glendale to see if we could quickly help her get a replacement key...even though it was almost 10am i was kept on hold for over 20 mins before anyone other than the receptionist would even speak to me and all the receptionist did was continue to repeat the phrase, " i'll page the service department for you". Called another toyota dealership and was speaking to someone in the service department within 1 min.

I would never call or go to this toyota dealership again.< /review>

<review>I went to Toyota of Glendale on Brand Oct 02,2013, for my first Toyotacare service inspection on my new 2013 Toyota.  I dropped of my car for service and went back 2 hours to pick it up and noticed that the back bumper was damaged.  It appears like the person who drove the cars to the mechanic hit my car against somtehing.   I am so upset and it is just a terrible experience and especially when they did not point it out or reveal it to me until I showed it to the service  person Henry Saunders.  I am warning all toyota owners to please inspect your cars before driving off from these incompetent dealers.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Marlon S Henriquez, helped me with the battery issue i had. The problem was to get a new battery on my car and people were saying it would take 1 hour. At that time Marlon helped me to get my car in less than 1 hour.

If you need anything go to him.

I'm toyota man(because my wife. I'm just 10 years). But this location is not a friendly. sales?(Cheeky.during test drive call to other customer.Also I really don't understand they don't know deep question-like a siena ventilation button.they got too much PP(pride of prius) only focuse to BUY OR NOT?  before sign it we go to other dealer), service?(discriminate. For 2 min question wait 20 minand. and one of service staff, he is really long time work there. I still remember shouting on me. " toyota is number 1 maker! never problem!" after that huge big recall.)... all of it. I living in glendale(from this  to home lese then 3 mil) but we go to other toyota(about 20 mil away). Dear glendale toyota. your guys not yet to best dealer!!!!< /Text>

< review>
I went there to buy Toyota Sienna there. I called and asked if they can beat the price quote that I have from another dealer. They told me they can beat the price. Once I arrived to the dealer and wasted 1 hour, they told me they cannot beat that price and quoted me $1500 higher.< /review>

Tried 2 days calling for a service appointment, no one would speak to me. Had to go in and do it in person. Then they tried to lie to me about pricing and get an extra $100 out of me - which I proved wrong. Don't go here</text>

I came in looking for the best deal I could find. And Mario Lima was helping me search for all my best options left to Nissan and ended up coming back since Mario was super professional and not pressuring me! I ended up getting a deal I can afford for a 2021 efficient gas car carola. Thanks Mario Lima.</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) An advice for future Buyers, if they want to put a lease car with an option to buy is the worst decision you can make, they paint it in a way when you want to buy it, they ask you for downpayment again when you have already paid before with the leasing, Besides that you have to pay for the paperwork again, it's a great business that they grill like that ...

(Original)
Un Consejo para furutos Compradores , si les quieren meter un carro lease con opcion a compra es la peor desicion que puedes tomar, te la pintan de una forma cuando quieres aserla compra , te piden downpayment otra ves cuando ya as pagado antes con el leasing , aparte que tienes que pagar el papeleo otra ves es un negocio redondo que asen de esa forma ...< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>
