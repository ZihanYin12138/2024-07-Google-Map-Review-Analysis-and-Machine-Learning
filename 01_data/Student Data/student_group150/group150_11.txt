<review>Staff was able to fit my dog in for a same day appointment. He was seen that morning by a vet who called to explain the treatment plan. Appreciate the promptness and professionalism exhibited at this clinic. Will take my pet there again.< /review>< date>

I've been a longtime banfield wellness plan member. Every office is amazing with doctors and staff that truly care about your pet. Prices are reasonable. I like the fact that if you move around, your pets information can be transferred to another location...no starting over!<//review>

BEWARE! I took dog in for exam prior to dental cleaning.  5 days later, in the middle of the night, he started coughing, hacking and spitting up white foam.  I called Banfield  and was told they were very busy and could not see him for 4 days.  I took him to another vet and found out he had kennel cough.

Obviously they exposed him to a sick dog.  Kennel cough is highly  contagious and you must keep sick dogs away from you healthy ones.  Dogs with kennel cough should be quarantined and kept away from healthy dogs.  The virus can be carried by those who have been around them so the vets, techs, etc.  need to change clothes, wash their hands and do all they can not to spread the disease

He was better in a matter of days.  It cost me $190.00 to get him treated but it was worth it because I now have a new vet who does not demand unnecessary tests, etc. just to hike up the bill.  The manager of Banfield said if I had brought him in they would have wanted X-rays, bloodwork etc.<//Text>

They were wonderful.   Our baby is recovering beautifully.  We were a little hesitant at first but her surgical site is the cleanest I have ever experienced and we have had so many dogs with surgeries being done at our local vets.< /Text>

<Text>Took my very healthy cat in for vaccinations and a yearly exam.  He is a healthy, indoor only, domestic cat.  Active, playful, cuddly, and VERY healthy.  I told the vet I just wanted a yearly visit (but this doesn't meet their ideal customer if money only comes in once)!  She immediately told me he had a heart murmur and needs blood work done.  Without missing a beat she laid out a financial plan on the table for me to choose from.  Blood work will cost $200 plus the cost of vaccines and a visit -- now were talking almost $300...might as well take advantage of the plan at $25/month for a yearly contract.  This made sense to me so I signed up at that rate.  She took my cat into the backroom without me.  Separating animal from owner (look out for places like this you guys seriously)!  She ran blood work and came back with nothing.  She recommended we move forward with a urine analysis -- an additional cost that I can bring down for the low price of $35/month on the upgraded plan...I declined this and opted for a cheaper test --which also showed nothing.  Her next recommendation was an echo cardiogram of which costs $700!  Keep in mind, I brought in a healthy, active and very normal cat.  I told her that this was getting a bit ridiculous and I need to discuss with my husband before moving forward with anything.  She then went on to tell me that we could put him down and all costs would be closed out for us and we wouldn't have to make monthly payments.
So....just kill my cat?

I left worried about my cat (they know you love your animal and they will manipulate that).

My husband and I decided to take our cat to another vet for a second opinion.  Guess who DOES NOT HAVE A HEART ISSUE!!  Banfield lied and manipulated my family to cheat us out of our money at $25/month.  I have no respect for their practice.

The vet wanted to kill my cat to make money off of us.  This would have broken our hearts...but hey as long as their pockets are lined it doesn't matter to them.< /Text>< pics>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rating>5< /Rating><text>I recently moved to California from the East Coast and had always done Banfield since my dog was a puppy (he's 9 1/2 years old now) and wanted to find a good trustworthy Banfield by where I live in South Bay.  I read reviews for many of the locations and San Pedro had the best reviews by far so I made an appt there.  Diddy went in for just some vaccinations but I also had several other concerns as well I wanted to discuss.  Dr. Dean was the doctor that we got paired with for this appt. and she took all my concerns and questions and answered them one by one after she saw Diddy and was so great in every way.  She expressed Diddy would need to get a dead cracked tooth removed and while he was under suggested that he get a fatty acid deposit on his side that was growing removed - said it wasn't necessary but was her suggestion considering many factors.  Just off of how great the vet had been during that visit and how great the reviews were I decided to proceed.  Diddy had the surgeries under Dr. Dean and through the day of surgery and the two weeks to follow during his healing she was so attentive, helpful and in the middle of the healing when he had developed a double ear infection (when it rains it pours!!) I called them prior to them opening at 7am and left a message of his condition and they literally called me at 6:59am and got him in that day to fix that issue.  I have never had a Banfield where the staff & Dr.'s are so attentive and responsive and it's so great! Diddy has now had the stitches removed and he is fully on the mend again and I'm so glad I made the choice to not only choose this Banfield but trust them with my dog who is my fur child and my love.  I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Dean and this Banfield location - they are so great in everyway and a great place to trust with your pet!< /text></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have 4 dogs & 1 cat, so I spend way too much time at vet offices. They were the nicest staff I have ever encountered at a vet. There was no wait time and I could tell that every person I encountered truly loves animals. I've tried almost every vet along Western Avenue and this has been my favorite. Plus they give you a bunch of cute free stuff like stickers and treats.</review>< Pictures>

They were there for our family!!! Our 15 yr old Sandy was suffering in pain.  We scheduled to let her go on a Monday at our regular Veterinary hospital.  But after a long Saturday night of suffering we knew she couldn't wait one more day. I called when Banfield opened Sunday morning. The receptionist gave us an appointment that day, even though we had never been there before.
We were taken into a private room, that was very comfortable for our whole family, especially our dog Sandy. They were very sensitive to our emotional and financial needs. No one rushed us. All options and cost were discussed.
I wish I could remember everyone's name to thank them personally.  The following week we received a very thoughtful card in the mail.
Thank You for taking care of our Sandy and us, during that difficult time.</Text>

<review>Took my 7 month old puppy at 6:30pm because her mouth was swollen and she was throwing up. I was told I would have to take her to the pet hospital. Why be open until 7 if you can't help. South shores never would have done that. I was going to start bring my dog there but you can forget it. Thanks for nothing.<//review>< GmapID>

<review>I"m giving 5 star field the experience. My friend took me there to see their love music on Friday nights. Everyone was dancing with the music and was having a great time. The cafe had been there for many years when many restaurants closed in the first year. Therefore they deserve to get 5 stars.</review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2db-zs06YGKesYV71HcS82KfURJtOwTqVPZF4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNdwdAdaubFHAkX_SaqauRfwCWdk47GbYUa_Y4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5yBanLaugXiRLskt9vSOkyFhAn13JExN1df2r=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_lPR8CCl48Ld2aBh4DrMaZEkt5mNss4PMzxEe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIN5myX1h_GfwexIqmzj-izwY9tWu-lqQHY12x=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXk4k0Ob0wFdrmDVQ3L6ScU1iAdkqaAlrC-2Jo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcX_eK2Tz0YpfOfxx7Pc-a4ESEPozdWb7S9eeb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOaMGpvrdl01zR9ANrNKZiM04eIqsoaSYrtyBiB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBXanDiCAd6mJEQAKsL89fc106xklbjjIw5iJt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpKrp9DBevuwd6C2BLbpM_2x0t1DqY1i-wPbHP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPASug3lf8qAnVDALqKQqG1P4jDUpmXFzKnI3T9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNU5PMbk4xwu5jqAcONYQKmK_uztZx0UllMIoHj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsNInVPtp9yCRIFDR50QnVgD5J3aO0JcQR1tF9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPLfyqjtDN1B03_kCplQ5X3uL8E0vWr-oVAxZWe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxvZIRN-QcBRXfJtq4YT9xw5w4R0rdjzf1hzKC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPtWOsZnOaxnFRbJPf78207jH9j-lol10wCQpY2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

<text>Went there for the first time in many years and had their fish and chips. The fish tasted like it came from a microwave meal I used to eat on the cheap. Also no tartar sauce but whatever. Some of the fries that were closer to the salad were a little soggy. Yes, there is a salad (if you can call it that since it's just lettuce and tomato), but hey actual vegetables instead of just fried everything is good. It also came with 3 onion rings which was nice. The restaurant was very quiet and empty, very few people there at 6pm and only one server and cook working. At least the service was good and the price was relatively cheap.< /text>< gmap_id>

<Review>This is only based on my order today.

$0.99 chicken taco during certain days of the week. Bought 4 today. Normally, the chicken on the chicken taco I tasted in the past are “grilled”. The chicken on my $0.99 chicken taco is different. See the picture.

The outdoor seating is a great addition to the place. At least the food odor will not stick to my clothing. 👍

But eating alone feels bad and lonely 😩 😭😞

So bring someone with you...<//Review>< pics>

My brother first introduced Rick's to me when he worked at the Alhambra theater, along with the El Rey theater  back in the early 80s. To this day, whenever we come to L.A., it's a must to come eat at Rick's. Without a doubt, one of the best places to eat in L.A. Keep up the great work and awesome food guys!!!<//review>

The cashier was extremely silent while I was ordering and couldn't even be bothered to ask if I was ready to order or not. I don't even know if she was listening to me at all to begin with, as she asked if it was "for here or to go" about five times before she finally got the hint. Add to that the fact that they served me the greasiest breakfast burrito I've ever had and a cup that was filled near to the brim with ice an you got yourself the worst breakfast experience I've had. Would not recommend to anyone...<//Text>

<text>Rick's has classic Mexican and Gringo food.  The burgers and tacos are  popular, but I really like the spinach quesadillas.  Even better, Ricks hosts a diverse--pop, classic rock, blues, jazz,  folk,  corridos,  and boleros- Open Mic Wednesdays  from 6:00 p.m. to 8:30.  Come and eat and dig the music or sign up to play.   No cover charge.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Horrible service, mediocre food and too high of prices for what is basically garbage. Went there this morning the food server was talking to her friend rather than take care of customers, had to wait until she finished talking to her friends to place an order. Food was cold when delivered and half cooked, was given plastic utensils instead of metal even though metal utensils were available. Don't eat here, McDonald's is even better than this rathole. Don't ask me about the restrooms, you don't want to know.< /text>

<review>Like I mentioned in my previous review.... Rediscover this Jem of a place that it once was. Walked in with my Lady and younger Son. We ordered Cheeseburger Combos. We sat inside and waited for our food. The food arrived to our table nice and hot. Right off the grill. Why I say to Rediscover Rick's Drive in and out is because we went at around 5:30ish pm. There was a gentleman and on thee other 3 was a lady and what looked like to be a toddler. Idk if anyone remembers the Previous owner Mr. Gilbert? Well the food is the right still from that time because the Chef is the light completic gentleman who was Gilbert's right hand man. That's correct, he now owns the business. Can't go wrong??? So let's show him that we still remember Rick's and help the guy out a little ?😜 So he knows he made the right choice. I like other food establishments, Highly recommend this delicious Hamburger place to all.<//review><user>103252756596390404088< /user><rate>5<//rate><username>Chuy Viramontes< /username><Pics>None</Pics>< Time>

It had been years since I was at Ricks. My memories are better than todays. I was disappointed with this last visit, I took my folks...it was 12:30 on a Friday, not busy, ordered a pastrami combo, was told no out of pastrami. No unsweetened ice tea, it was a big miss for me. ):</text>

<review>Ever since that mean little chinese woman bought the business from Gilbert the place has gone downhill badly. She's not very friendly the atmosphere has gone downhill. The prices has been jacked up, the quality of the food not as good. It's not a friendly atmosphere over there anymore, most of the regulars don't even go over there. They don't have bands playing there anymore, if a band does play there, they pay them half of what they used to. It's just not the same. The place has really gone downhill.<//review>< Pics>

Ricks needs to get their staff to be more friendly with customers. Including the new owner, they usually have this jacked up sour look. It needs,a remodel but food is pretty good. Portions are ok, I would like bigger portions of fries and O- Rings .< /Text>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Nice local spot. Just feels like the employees don't care as much as they use too. The cashier lags on me; the cook takes care of me at the front. Other than that I guess it's cool. They don't bother me. Was kinda irate one time with them. I remember when I used to get coffee with my breakfast they'd give me a coffee mug, but lately they've not done that but they give it to other patrons. It's just my pet peeve about it (1st world problems bleh)......</Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2c526df88276f:0x756f2f1d7e5d8a0< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Was once one of my favorite places to get a burger. I grew up coming here for burgers and have never had a problem until now. And believe me, I am not recommending this place to anyone ever again. I was waiting for my order to be taken at the counter and it was taking unusually long despite there being few customers at the time. This would have been dismissed and forgotten about, but one of the cooks saw me and didnt even bother to call a cashier and when the cashier decided to come and attend me she blamed me claiming that I should have called for her. If I am at a restaurant, I wait at the cash register/counter for my order to be taken, not call out for an employee to come. That is not something that a customer is expected to do. She continued questioning why I didn't call for her, and I didn't know how to respond; this was unexpected. I answered that because it is her job to attend a customer, I did not feel the need to call for her. She rudely told that she had other jobs to do at the restaurant, which I am sure is true, but as an employee dealing with a customer you don't answer rudely and you don't give attitude and complain. After that I decided to say nothing else and then she tried to justify herself by saying that she is a sarcastic person and to not take it personal. You only use sarcasm with your friends or with those you wish to offend. I am not her friend, so I am assuming it was to offend me. She asked if I was mad and I tried to just not answer, for arguing with her seemed to be pointless, given that she disregarded what customer service means. She pressured me to give her an answer and I told that I don't appreciate her complaining to me: a customer. She responded saying that she will keep that into consideration, but with a fake tone and smile. After that, she finally took my order. I honestly have never been treated so badly by an employee.<//review>

Ordered a steak dinner and watched 2 to go orders leave(they came after me) after a 15 min wait I walked up and asked about my order and the lady was counting money. My order was ready and getting cold. I asked for a refund, the lady at the counter had me waiting for a refund also. I was so angry i walked away. Do not come here is my advice, and never tip if you do.</review>

Went in to order what I usually get and the lady lied and said we don't sell breakfast burritos at this time. Lol, I bought one later than 5 but I guess someone didn't feel like working. She had the worst attitude and dumbest look on her face. Also mind you there was no signage saying we sell breakfast up to this time. The cook didn't speak a word of English aswell.</Review>

Bad! I  been to other Ricks before but this one has bad food and bad service. It took about 20 mins to get my hamburger and pastrami. And than the pastrami taste like
Bologna. Very disappointed :(< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Its quality has lowered, the food is not always fresh, sometimes it is good and you come back and something happened ???
It is already with less quality, in terms of attention I have to say that the waitresses if they do their best to serve you and see that you do not lack anything, but it is not what it was before. If you are bored, take a walk on Friday or Saturday at 7 : 00pm, DJ, or live band to dance or listen.

(Original)
A bajado su calidad, la comida no siempre está fresca, en ocasiones es buena y vuelves y algo paso???
Ya está con menos calidad, en cuanto a atención he de decir que las meseras si se esmeran en servirte y ver que no te falte nada, pero no es lo que era antes.Si estás aburrido date una vuelta el viernes o sábado a las 7:00pm, DJ, o banda en vivo para bailar o escuchar.< /text>

GG park is a well-maintained and lovely place filled with miles and miles of trails, museums, flower gardens and playgrounds. It's really large so if you're looking to get away and relax alone you will find the space here.</Review>

I called yesterday and ordered a bouquet for my girlfriend. I asked them to deliver in the afternoon, and they did! They delivered on time, as promised, and the picture that my girlfriend sent to me with the bouquet looked gorgeous! It was really what was on their website! I will definitely order and use them again! Highly recommended!< /text>

<review>I am visiting from out of town for the week. I picked up some flowers for a wonderful girl. I called them first to see if they had the flowers I was looking to purchase. Thank goodness they did! Other florists around told me the ones I was looking for were coming out of season. Some lovely people warmly greeted me. They had just gotten som peonies fresh in that morning. All I had to do was pick which ones I wanted. The florist behind the counter did a phenomenal work of art, adding some other elements as well as some Lilly's. I highly recommend going here for any of your florist needs!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxB26waSdZ6AFhpMgCtgl9zEEuu6T6yYkVi7z4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEwekGXP1-lEcn7iZwDr0aNQwI5FLrNKd6Gckt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPijNZbrkwhxQhRHI8nOQjEiZ3v32DYYO0fOqLv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d954e4ccc55adb:0x9d6906113f858e13</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It was affordable and made her whole day! I am in shock. Everyone turned me down except for this place and I am so grateful.
Thank you Dave!!! I will be back.<//review><time>1612239228728<//time>< name>

Jim Martin (owner) has been my florist of choice for over 20 years. Dave's is great. The flowers are fresh, arrangements are great, staff is awesome, and the delivery is on time.
Dave's is the place to go!</text>

Went online from out fo town to send flowers to a friend.  Easy shopping and easy checkout.  Got a picture of the flowers today from my friend and they looked better then online.  Only thing is I never received an email confirmation of the order so I was a little nervous.  With everything going on these days, it was a simple process overall, and beautiful arrangement.</text>

<review>Ordered this beautiful arrangement for my husband and kids through Teleflora and was fulfilled through Dave's!! Its absoulutley BEAUTIFUL and AMAZING! Dare I say better then what was puctured!! (Balloon wasn't included I added it)

The ONLY issue I had was NOT THE FAULT of this florists, I ordered this particular arrangement for the vase it was advertised on Teleflora's site in. Working with a floral company in the past I understand things like that are only available as long as the supplies last. However the same arrangement w/the vase is still being sold on Teleflora's site with no mention of the possibility of it coming in a different vase. Again none of this is the florist issue. After contacting Teleflora they are sending the correct vase from their warehouse.<//review>< Gmap_id>

“OMG! These flowers are so BEAUTIFUL!!!”   These were the words my friend used when she received the flowers I sent from Dave’s Flower Box last weekend (06/30).
I found Dave’s on the Internet and called from South Carolina.  The gentleman who took the call was so nice and understanding of why I was sending the flowers and how I wanted them to look.  He assured me he would send a really nice and unique arrangement.
My friend really loved the flowers and the photos she sent to me showed just how beautiful and exotic the flowers were. Thank you Dave’s Flower Box for bringing my friend some joy at a difficult time.</text>

<review>Jim was so kind and had wonderful suggestions for additional touches with my wedding decor. He clearly has a lot of experience working with flowers for weddings, and his attention to detail is delightfully amazing. The standard bouquets already in the store are great as well, and I will be stopping by regularly to treat myself to some floral arrangements for the house after my wedding weekend.< /review>< pictures>

It was delivered on time, which was nice. But while the arrangement must have once been pretty, the flowers looked wilted right away and barely lasted two days. The pink roses had grey, rotting petals on the inside and even asters and stargazer lilies which usually last a long time looked far from fresh. I sent a picture to my family to thank them (from the most flattering angle), and they were disappointed saying that they had ordered a much nicer bouquet online. It's a shame, because I'm sure my loved ones paid an arm and a leg from overseas for this online flower delivery.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80d954e4ccc55adb:0x9d6906113f858e13< /gmap_id></record>

<Text>For my first experience with them, I called in with a last minute bouquet request, and gave them a price range. I let them talk me into keeping the slightly larger arrangement because they said it would work better. They tell me to wait a half an hour. I'm in a hurry, so I go down there after 15 minutes so I can leave the second they're done, and the bouquet is already waiting. It's gorgeous, and, all in all, very reasonably priced for how great it looks. Service was friendly, and I will definitely shop here again.</Text><Date>1367886932987</Date>< response>

<Text>One of the main reasons you choose the option to have flowers delivered is for the recipient to be able to receive all the joy, and excitement that goes with receiving flowers at work .  It is pointless to deliver the flowers when the recipient is not there, and to have somebody else sign for them. You are taking away the point of having the flowers delivered. So,  the next time that someone tells you the person will be in to work at 12:30, how about you deliver the flowers when the person is AT WORK!...not 3 hours before they arrive to work. I'll give you 4 stars because the flowers were beautiful,  I picked them out. But not five stars because you suck on the delivery... which was around $20 in addition to the flowers, and she wasn't even that far away from the shop.< /Text><Rate>4</Rate>< pics>

<Text>The most beautiful, sweetest smelling, longest lasting roses I've ever received.  This was last year and I keep telling my friend from Reno to call you directly when he orders flowers, but I think he still uses a wire service.  The roses from the other local florists don't hold a candle to ones I received from your shop.
I plan to call the service he uses to update their files. Maybe they will list you as the florist to use here in San Diego.  I hope so!<//Text>< user_id>

A wonderful experience!  I first used Dave's a long time ago to deliver flowers to my wife's work...and it was superb!  I've used other 'services'...such as, 'online' services...and was disappointed each time.  Dave's Flower Box's service is the best!!</text>

They have roses of every color. Are very helpful in arranging a boquet in minutes. For around $20 bucks you can get a big and interesting arrangment<//Text>

<Text>DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY: I purchased flowers for my wife for Valentines Day online on 2/5/18. DFB never delivered the flowers. I called the store and asked for a manager to call me back on 2/14/18. I never got a return call. I called my bank and disputed the charges. To this day I have never heard back from DFB. However, looking at my bank, DFB has the audacity to fight the dispute for flowers they NEVER delivered!

BUYERS BEWARE DO NOT BUY FROM THIS COMPANY!!!<//Text><user>107168297224874890638<//user><Gmap_id>0x80d954e4ccc55adb:0x9d6906113f858e13< /Gmap_id>< pictures>

<Text>Im a makeup hobbyist and I visit all the time. The store is always clean and organized and for the most part the wait in line isn't that bad. The only downside to this location is that it is never quick or easy to find someone to do a shade match. Its helpful to know what you want because it is not often that a worker will approach you to help you.<//Text>< userid>

<Review>I use to love Ulta! But my last couple experiences have been horrible!
First off, every time I walk in nobody says anything, but yet every single time person that walks in before or after me (who is of different a different ethnicity than me) they always greet them with “Welcome” or “How can I assist you?”
Secondly, every time I ask for assistance with finding a product, the employees either ignore me or they say “it’s not available” without even checking - even though the app says it’s “available for pick up”
Furthermore, I think there should be more diversity at this Ulta(like there use to be) and there should be more people who are willing to help/answer questions.< /Review>< pics>

<rate>1</rate><text>I picked up my order last Thursday. I’ve never had an issue with this store until now. When I picked up my curbside order, the Hispanic girl that came out, didn’t say hello, she just asked for my ID, I showed it to her and then she threw my order into my car from a far away distance. Now I understand the social distancing and no contact pick up, but there is no reason to throw a customers order the way she did. And to top it off, she didn’t say thank you. I’ve spent so much money is the last week at this store, I don’t deserve my orders be thrown at me. I asked for someone from this store to contact me but no response.<//text>< Time>

One person working checkout, six people in line. Took twenty minutes to get out of store. Wouldn't you think checkout would be a priority for sales? There lucky I even waited. No wonder Amazon is killing it who wants to deal with that</text>

First off as I was making my way through Ulta store @ 7000 Market Pl Dr, Goleta, CA 93117 between 12pm-1:30pm on 1/26/18 I was appalled at over hearing a store associate speaking negatively about customers within ear shot of myself shopping the store. It was awkward & uncomfortable to say the least. The associate that was gripping about customers stating that she can't get anything done because a customer will walk up and start moving display items around again this person was Deborah at least that is what she stated her name is, but she as well as a few others were not wearing name badges. She is tall, Caucasian, about late 40's, 50 or 60, medium length dark brown/black hair, severe red lipstick on. She did approach me to ask if I needed help, and that seemed insincere especially after hearing her speech beforehand. I said I am looking for an eyeliner by Ulta, and I was in front of Ulta products to which she made it seem like I was well equipped after finding Ulta brand she slyly distanced herself from me. Her co-worker whom she was complaining to however stepped in shortly after Deborah departed. Allie asked if I needed help, I told her yes I am looking for an Ulta duo eyeliner, and Allie actually remembered the product & explained it is a seasonal item then she went on to see if she could find me the plum shade I fell in love with. We both searched and found Mystic Ulta eyeliner to be the best match. I thanked her and continued shopping. I then was trying to find a lip scrub, and was guided by another friendly associate to Pacifica brand lip scrub.  I thanked her and tried the lip scrub out on my wrist and carefully chose the lip item in front that were all opened. As I was testing what clearly was a used Test item, that is when Deborah decided I need a stern talking to. She said I am not allowed to try items on, and I said it is a tester & has already clearly been used many times as such. She snottily said it will say tester on it if it is a tester. I then asked her name, and pointed out that she should then remove all the items in the front that have been opened so no one else buys them and or mistakenly uses them as a tester. She said well then we wouldn't be able to sell them....I was shocked! She clearly could see & I pointed out all the lip items in the front display were all opened way before I got there & all were clearly being used as testers!!! So for her to attack me for not doing her job was quite the opposite of the very Top notch service I always get from Ulta. I got the feeling she doesn't even like her job or customers, and though I had my hands clearly full of items I happily found to purchase she treated me like an unwelcome customer as she clearly can't stand any of us a she stated earlier to her co-worker. So, I get that she hates her job & customers but don't feel she had the right to take out her aggression on me. I have never ever been so aggressively approached by any customer service person Ever!  I am happy to say that this kind of customer service is not my normal experience, and I left happy with the items I was able to find. I am however still horrified that she did not remove the items from the Pacifica line that were all open and being used as testers! That means she will knowingly allow her co-workers to sell used items, and let customers buy from items that were already used in store!< /text>

Good prices and overall brand selection, but the drugstore brand area is always a complete mess, and the whole store is always out of stock on at least half the items there. It is also extremely understaffed and I can never find someone when I need help<//review>

<Review>My experience at the hair salon was sub-par.

The reason I decided to try the hair salon at Ulta was because I received via mail a coupon for a $30 cut and style for new guests. It said to book online by 4/19/2017. On Wednesday the 19th, I didn't have access to wifi, so I called and made an appointment over the phone. The woman I spoke to said there were no walk-ins available for that day, so I made one for 1 o'clock the next day (Thursday).

When I arrived Thursday at 1, there was no one at the salon counter. After waiting a few moments, I went in search of an employee. The store was nearly empty, so I found one immediately. She directed me to Cecilia, who was to be my stylist. Cecilia acknowledged me then promptly walked away with some guy she had been talking to. I continued to wait at the salon bar for an extra 5-10 minutes while various other employees asked me if I had an appointment and didn't seem to know where Cecilia had gone. This all happened while on my lunch break, so I was under a time constraint.

Strangely, it wasn't until 3:54 pm that same day that I received a text confirming my appointment at 1 pm. A miscommunication about appointments is  understandable, but I found Cecilia's behavior to be unprofessional.

Additionally, I was not very satisfied with the haircut she gave. I asked for layers and a trim - I said that I don't mind sacrificing a bit of length if it makes my ends look healthier. But after she was finished, I had to ask her to go over certain spots again, because there were still lots of noticeable split ends. She also didn't cut the hair framing my face at all until I specifically requested.

My hair also felt very dry after the blowout. I was curious about the products she used. She used Redken anti-frizz shampoo, which I don't feel was very appropriate for my hair type. I'm not sure what hairspray she used (she wasn't sure when I asked), but it didn't seem to have any heat protective elements. My hair felt damaged after the blowout.

And finally, she was very rough with the way she handled my hair. She neglected to brush out any of the tangles after washing my hair, so each time she made a long pass with the comb, it ripped out some of my baby hairs. I could see them knotted in the comb after she was finished. I'm not usually tender headed, but that hurt.

Disappointingly, I forgot to bring the coupon with me to my appointment, so I paid full price for this negative experience.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Never a good experience here. The employees are never friendly and usually downright rude. They always have long lines and somehow only one person on the till. I was a fan of the Ulta in my hometown but this one has ruined the company for me.</Text>

<Text>It's a gun shop..not a thrift store or a hardware store.. GUNS and ammo (if you buy a gun). I understand both the angst from customers and from the shop owners. These are sketchier times. As far as my runnings with the shop.. generally prickly at times and warmer customer service at other times.. just depends on the moment.  I have had excellent suggestions and have not been led astray for the sake of a sale. When something wasn't right about a purchase they took extra effort and even did some tactical repair work to make things right. I go back when the occasion arises. We don't have many options in San Francisco so just call before you go and get things clear about your intentions with the shop. My 3 cents...< /Text><gmap_id>0x808f7a5455d01b85:0xa0e6bf0de2494054</gmap_id><rate>5<//rate>< resp>

<text>I've had a few transactions here and I've been happy each time. They have a good system to manage the increased demand and space restrictions, their prices are reasonable, and they have a selection of handguns, shotguns, and rifles in stock (including some fixed-mag semi autos at the time of this review). Ammo is restricted to those purchasing a gun, which is common right now in the Bay Area. Staff are busy and may be focused or multitasking but they don't rush you and are willing to help the 1st time buyer through the process.</text>< Pics>

First, they explain that you need to purchase a gun in order to purchase ammunition. Then, they’ll explain that ammunition is in short supply. One excuse after another, though, you probably won’t have much difficulty purchasing ammunition if they know you. Thank you Gavin Newsom and Nancy Pelosi.<//review>

<name>Chris Flum<//name><text>They had no ammo for me unless I purchased a gun, why would I get a gun when I have one and then have the waiting period, I was headed to the ranch, we have 1200 acres and Mt. Lions are very active. We have to keep kids and pets in, we needed ammo to resupply the ranch. Nothing worse than having no protection. Typically we fire off a few rounds during the day and early evening but not this trip I had four 357 shells no 30/30 and no 22 shells for a five day stay.</text><response>None<//response>< date>

<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Waited for several hours do to covid crazieness. Was there to purchase with a friend and my girlfriend. After her waiting for two hours when we got to the front of the line they skipped several times us because of store capacity(3) and then since she wasn't sure she was going to buy a firearm the owner told her to leave. Then he proceeded to grab my arm and move me out of the way. Unfortunately, they had what I needed at this difficult time and so I made a significant purchase rather then waste the time.

The second time I returned to pick up my purchase the staff proceeded to insult me over taking the situation seriously. While John at the door and half the staff there are friendly and knowledgeable, the owner and his underlings are a dark spot on the other very nice people there.

I will not be returning to shop there and I suggest you bring your business elsewhere. I know it's hard to find available ammo(spoiler alert unless you're buying a Firearm they won't sell you ammo anyway) and firearms but finding a good shop that isn't insulting and demeaning to customers and potential buyers is more important.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Although I had the paperwork and my receipt for the Glock 19 Gen 5, they tried to act like I purchased the Gen 4 even though you can clearly see I was charged and paid for the Gen 5.

<Text>Yeah .  Just a tad racist.  As one of the employees was helping me I noticed the tall young guy looking at me funny.  I could tell he was inspecting my look and profiling me. Then right in front of me he whisper something into the ear of the employee helping me and they started laughing.  I looked at him and he literally started turning red in the face right in front of me.  I didn’t purchase anything but I just continued to ask questions.  So from now on that is what I will do.  I’ll keep coming in and ask them questions.  Then I’ll go home and buy it online for a cheaper price.  Can’t wait to go back and just smile in their faces and ask more questions  .  This is the way you get even.  Make them work for nothing.  Online prices even with shipping is still way cheaper than this gun shop.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808f7a5455d01b85:0xa0e6bf0de2494054</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Their prices are a little bit more than other bay area dealers but they have a few guys who are real knowledgeable. For example Henry, the retired SFPD officer who worked at the Chinatown Vallejo Street precinct. To the young fella who started here after Jackson Arms closed. They never rush you and will continue to show you one product after another until you find the right fit.  One bad thing about them is that the parking often times fill up fast.</text>

I never comment but after reading some of the reviews I just had to. This place is great, the perfect gun store to go to ask for one on one questions about anything gun related. Maybe Cali gun stores have to deal with a bunch of non-informed gun people and those people think it's like buying products from a Best Buy store when buying a gun.... it's not. Anyway, great store, great inventory and best of all, great prices. They will see me again in a month to buy the Sig I never thought to buy!<//review>

<text>I would absolutely shop here again. And plan to. I went in with my apprehensive wife (new to the shooting scene) and she felt very comfortable and at ease in the store. The guy behind the counter that helped me took his time and helped me decide between 2 different 1911s. I have been to other shops up and down the coast and this was one of the most friendly and helpful I have been to.< /text>< Pics>

Of all the stores in the Bay Area this is the only one with the friendliest atmosphere. They are accurate in their requirements and they triple check paperwork. Selections are limited but mostly the hard-to-find are here. Competitive prices too.< /review>

While there is some camping/survival gear and bow-hunting gear, the store is much more specialized towards shooting sports, self defense firearms, and ammunition.  Staff has always been welcoming and friendly, and will answer questions or point you in the right direction if they do not have the item in stock.

A small, but solid gun store.

Quality: The selection is a bit minimal and cramped, but you can find the basics here with ease. I've yet to be offered junk.

Appeal: Finding any gun stores in an urban west coast city is a trick. Appeal is very high because it's so local!

Service: They are great. I buy an uncommon round and they are always ready to help me see what they have.< /text>

They more wanted to sell me a gun than talk to me about my concerns. But it is a gun store so I see why, they answered all my questions though. Their office manager Colline is lovely and makes the processs a breeze. The staff are knowledgeable and helpful when it's busy you may have to wait a bit it's a gun shop it happens. A little more expensive than other places I've been but they are solid. Though occasionally they will say something off color or political, I'm not here for politics I'm here for a firearm and the culture around gun shops can be a little abrasive in my opinion again these people are lovely, ok knowledgeable, and professional.<//Review>

Trust is the reason why I continue to do Business with City Arms.

Once you develop trust you will get the customer service you are looking for.

Remember "Trust goes both ways"

I go nowhere else but City Arms.

We adore the lights they've strung up high so you can tell if a spot is open (little green light) or occupied (little red light). Great views of surrounding hills if you happen to park on the roof; elevator at SW corner is near an alley through to Castro Street shops.</review>

It's a high school auditorium so wasn't expecting high end. Would be nice if the restrooms were in the building.

Also a little thing but in high school I would think we treat students better then referring to them as boys and girls.<//Review>

<Review>This campus is one of my favorite places to go to when traveling with our dance competition team. The layout of the campus is open and there are quite a few good restaurants close by. There’s even food trucks that come to the location when there’s event here. The seating is quite comfortable and easy for busy dance parents that need to run back and forth. This is a great venue for any group that needs a performing theater. The stage is large and accommodates a large production.< /Review></record>

Everyone was super friendly and Dr. Elahi was amazing, put me at ease immediately. They were gentle, thorough, explained everything in a straightforward way, and took the time to listen to any concerns I had about my teeth. And they have TVs! Overall I think this was the best dental experience I’ve ever had. I’ve found my forever dentist! I Highly recommend Stunning Smiles of Lake Forest.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I have been going to Stunning Smiles twice a year for more than five years. Over the years, Dr. Joe and Dr. Elahi have taken care of me, my wife and daughter. They always treat us like their own family. Plus, I get to watch some cool TV shows while I'm in the chair during the appointments. Here's a tip: I often recommend Dr. Elahi to friends because she has a nice, easy touch and manages to do the work while causing the least amount of pain. I know someone with sensitive teeth who said Dr. Elahi made it possible for them to enjoy having regular checkups. You won't regret coming to this great little neighborhood dentist.<//review>

Great front desk , customer service and appointment scheduling experience.
Dentists Dr. Elmira Elahi & Dr. Joseph Shilkofski, both very professional,  friendly , easy to talk, everything was explained in details before procedure and after. I got root canal and crown done, so far i am satisfied with my experience.</text>

<Review>Dr. Joe is great. I met him for a free consultation and he treated me like an existing patient. He was extremely thorough in his explanations and gave me all possible options. He even took the time to show me a short video of a few of my options so I can better understand the procedure. I would not hesitate to refer everyone to him.  It's nice to see there are still people caring dentists.< /Review><time>1565037583141<//time><pics>None< /pics>< gmapID>

I absolutely LOVE this place!! You are hearing this from someone who used to get super nervous for every upcoming dental visit! I have seen both Dr. Elahi and Dr. Joe and they are both amazing dentists with the best bedside manners!
They explain every step and take as much time needed to make you feel very comfortable and relaxed.
I highly recommend this beautiful clean office to everyone who wants to receive an exceptional service and great dental work.< /Review>

So happy we found this practice! Dr. Elahi and Dr. Shilkofsky are crazy thorough and really happy to walk you through everything, not to mention being super gentle. They have a wealth of knowledge that most dentists just don't. The office is state of the art, gorgeous, all digital, lots of cool gadgets. You are getting the best care here. And Usman and Camelia are rockstars. You will not find nicer or more friendly and helpful people, honestly. No more dreading the dentist!</text>

<Review>I gotta say hands down, this is one of thee best facilities I've been too. I can say that this place has a very welcoming environment and goes above and beyond to help their customers. I recommended this beautiful facility to many of my friends and family. They use the correct procedures and actually look for their client's comfort over anything else.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dce85835a30ced:0xabedf705c61c7d49< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have had many Dentist over the years but none of them were as good as Dr. Joe with Stunning Smiles. Dr. Joe gives you quality care and gets to know his patients, unlike other dentist who try to get you in and out quickly as possible, while digging deep into you bank account.

I would recommend anyone to Stunning Smiles, you will like what you see and the care that you get.</review>< Pictures>

Excellent service, clean and modern dental practice and definitely did not feel as if they were pushing unnecessary procedures. Dr. Elahi was very personable and took her time to explain everything to me and offer excellent preventive care recommendations for my specific needs.  I highly recommend Stunning Smiles of Lake Forest.</text>

< Review>
I have been fearful of going to the dentist my entire life. I always put it off until it became an emergency situation. But then I went to Dr. Joe Shikofski. Dr. Joe is the gentilist and most skilled dentist I have ever been to. His office is state of the art. I don't fear going to the dentist at all now. If you find you need a dentist or just need a dental check up, make an appointment. I'm sure you be as relieved and pleased as I am.< /Review>

<Review>When I first arrived for my appointment I was absolutely astounded by how clean and how pleasant the atmosphere of the office was. The receptionist was very nice and welcoming. When I was ready for my appointment I met with Dr. Elahi. I usually don't enjoy going to the dentist, but she made me feel welcome and that I had nothing to worry about. Although it was a simple cleaning I had no problems feeling anxious for my appointment. If you are looking for a new dentist I would highly recommend Dr. Elahi and the team at Stunning Smiles of Lake Forest.</Review>< Pics>

I’ve been wanting to try this restaurant for a very long time, I’ve read a couple reviews that were not complementary, I’m glad I did not listen to those folks, the staff was very friendly and very helpful, I do not like onions and my wife does not like bell peppers, we always order everything special, the dumplings were fantastic the garlic Green beans were great, considering we always order things special it was very quick. I wish we could’ve ate there inside so everything would have been hot, but even though it was warm it was great. Please visit this place and help contribute to small businesses<//review>

Sweet and sour chicken barely had any flavor. Asked for fried dumplings, they were barely fried. More like steamed. And tasted like something was wrong with the meat, like it was going bad or something. Very disappointed.< /text>

One of the best local asian restaurants here! We door dashed it and requested no salt to be added and they did just that! The food was not at all salty and still had the wonderful flavor! Truly appreciated the accommodation and request as I know not having salt added is a hard thing to do. Anything on the menu is pretty tasty.<//Text>

<date>1570654979771<//date><rate>3< /rate><text>My wife and I come here often, so I figured it was time to do a review. The staff are polite and flavors here are consistently good. The decorations look nice, and they keep the temperature at a comfortable level. ( Will bring out a Portacool® when it gets to hot outside).

The issue that we have ran into every time we come here is the staging of the food. We'll order a few items ( this time it was tofu for Jess, chicken for me and we shared the soup dumplings). The tofu came out with both of our bowls of rice after about 7 minutes which is fine, but the dumplings came out about 6 minutes after that, and the chicken came out about 10 minutes after the tofu. So by the time I had my chicken my rice was already cold.

We will keep coming back because like I said, the flavors are amazing! But I'd love to see more strategy into how they bring out their courses.

Over all give it a try!< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOoYWRit7wkQGhu0d0amLqSfPKtc1-8ZMEPFgIl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOblq-UEfMy9bhbR41SgXzZrHUmOlzz2WLGWSOh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUmBemo9OKMhHATxnuS-s6dgcQzz1fsV-oQG9X=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPQz6HjlBM0tzgW0n8PLDFb4_GMRF9BOk4B2hsB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNISlgdI3pNgDOAwjHKqbPufNbReWhV7D6xS5YS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2U1RwU8Bl77a1X-OvH7PNmiodUuZiGJdZARSR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Resp>

This place is the bomb for authentic Chinese food. We always get their juicy pork dumplings,  green beans with chicken, scallion beef and pork fried rice. All the flavors are there in the sauces with fresh food always! We will continue to come here unless something changes. It would be five star but not enough seats in the place. So get their early or wait in line to get a table once they open back up for dinning.</review>

I can give zero star or it won’t let me post but this is a zero star reviewI just want to share this. Sorry this was a terrible experience.
I ordered the spicy wontons 2/10/21.
Portions size was good but the food was not good.
Dumpling had no flavor. No seasoning, very bland. They taste of metal or aluminum. The dishes is described as spicy but it is not spicy at all but instead the red oil they were tossed in had a metallic menthol flavor that made my lips and mouth numb and tingly. Definitely not from spicy but more like an allergic reaction to synthetic metallic flavor or like numb mouth from a menthol cigarette. Really bad. I would not recommend this dish at all. I will not be going back. I hate leaving a bad review with Covid and struggling businesses but don’t spend your money here.<//Text>

<text>The pan-fried pork buns (#3) are definitely a must get.
The hot and spicy pork belly with tofu skin and leek (#67) is tasty but is not spicy at all, I would order the x-spicy next time (btw it's Chinese leek, aka garlic chives).
The wonton soup (#12) was really nice, soup felt very comforting and not overly salted at all, and the wontons were perfectly cooked with a great texture and generous piece of shrimp inside.
In summary, great place to eat.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I come here all the time, and every time I come service is amazing; the waiters are so friendly! And the food is even better! I've had the vegetable plate with white rice and more, which was absolutely perfect for a vegan such as my self!!🌎 At first, I wouldn't have thought this place would have options for someone with my diet, but I was pleasantly surprised☺️ prices were resonable, and the wait wasn't too long either! The decorations are so beautiful, and the place is kept clean! 100% would recommend this place to friends and family!❤< /review>

<Text>My family was there for dinner on Monday. My eight year old son is highly allergic to peanuts. Upon tasting the beef soup and a dumpling, he had an immediate allergic reaction which included trouble breathing and swelling. Beware if you have family members with peanut allergies. The staff gets their dumplings from an outsource so they were unable to tell us with certainty if peanuts or peanut oil was used in their food. We ended up at the ER in Riverside. Not a pleasant experience for any of us. This day and age with so many people with allergies, I think the owners should know for a fact with if peanut oil or any kind of nuts are used in their food.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

People can stop lying and keep it real! Great food or not! SERVICE SUCK!!!! Now speaking of  food.  IT WAS GREAT AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF TIME WHEN THEY FIRST OPENED ! Not to mention,  service was great! This particular location suck in all! Staff should be ashamed of themselves ( rude, disrespectful) and the cook...Well, whatever happened from the  beginning of time to present.  The cook must have changed or gotten lazy!  Food is too oily. Other locations aren't oily! Might want to start appreciating that you still have customers and change up everything quickly before you start to decline business!!<//review>

<text>Service: 4
Atmosphere: 3
Food Quality: 3.5

Service__Female waitress-polite & on schedule for service, I'm not a fan of too often table visits. Food served reasonably quick.

Atmosphere__Clean tables & culture styled,
I like heavy culture decor, not that way here.
NO A/C when I visited, swamp cooler running.

Food__ Wide Rice Noodle / Pork / bok choi
W/No seasoning, Was not a flavor explosion. Was a nice mild Asian flavor, good to my taste palette. Add the chili oil, was tasty & not over powering.<//text>< pictures>

It took a while to get our dumplings but it was worth it! The beef dumplings were so delicious and warm when we got them. Highly recommend for anyone looking for an affordable delicious place to eat. The location was a little sketchy but other than that, pretty good.</text>

We eat here regularly, so clearly it can't be that bad lol! They are a little inconsistent however. Sometimes it's amazing, but occasionally it is a bit lackluster. I would still recommend it, though. And the staff at this location is very attentive.< /review>

Stopped by this place due to the reviews.  I’m traveling for work so I was just going to go to Texas Roadhouse and saw this place in the same shopping center.  The food was great as well as the service.  I ordered the juicy pork dumplings and beef noodle soup.  The noodle soup just needed a tad more salt and it would been perfect.  It was still good.  The dumplings were really good too.  Very juicy.</Text>

Good little restaurant. The food is delicious and the portions are large. I'd recommend splitting a meal or plan to take the majority of your meal home. The restaurant is clean, including the restrooms. The only downfall was the attentiveness of the wait staff. My son and I both ran out of our drinks and had to finish the second half without any water. Don't mistake this for the staff being unpleasant though, they were all extremely nice.< /review>

Wow, the juicy pork Dumplings are a must! And the cabbage plate is so full of flavor you can add it to any other plate for a full flavor. Best Dumplings in town. But eat them as soon as you get them don't let them get cold! Ever.< /Review>

This is our second time going to food bowl times were really delicious the wait is a little much I feel very upset when leaving I took my wife out on her 40th birthday and we had just enough money money was tight to pay for food so my wife can enjoy her 40th as we were leaving to waiter had yelled for me and my son to come back and had embarrassed in front of the restaurant that we didn’t leave a tip I was deeply upset and embarrassed about it if I had more money I would’ve left it for them I will never go back out of</Review>

This tiny hole-in-the-wall proves to be a fortress of consistently incredible Chinese dishes that use only the barest oil necessary! While other restaurants' dishes can look and taste like they were dunked into a bucket of oil, pulled out, and served, you can really tell how mindful the chefs here are of their oil use. Its salt-&-pepper fish fillet, with its electrifying peppers and scallions, will always be on my plate every time I'm here. No hygiene problems across my 4+ visits.< /text>

I didn't expect much from this place, but I'm really glad I was wrong! Unlike other Chinese restaurants, the food from Min's tastes super fresh and isn't greasy. Overall, for the price, service, and environment, you won't be disappointed! Also, like most reviewers have already said: definitely try out their Juicy Pork Dumplings, they're totally worth it!< /Text>

I got number 3 pan fried pork buns and they are highly recommended I enjoyed every bite.My husband ordered the pan fried dumpling and he really enjoyed them aswell. Next time though I am going to give number 1 the juicy pork dumplings a try.</text>< Pics>

Really enjoyed our food. Restaurant is a little small so I would avoid it during peak hours. We got lucky and were seated right before it got busy. The service was okay. They were friendly, but not very attentive throughout the meal.</Text>

The pork bao is definitely the star of the show. The dough is super spongy and chewy--delicious when eaten even by itself. The ground pork filling just takes the whole thing to another level. It is juicy, moist, and flavorful. If you've never had bao, the pork bao will be a perfect introduction to the world of bao.</text>

<text>A return visit about one year, unfortunately, the food quality has dropped.  I ordered the #26 Beef stir fry noodles, the portion was small, beef was not well trimmed, has ligament attached.

<Text>I've been going to Min's before they opened in Corona in Chino Hills. Me and my family would drive from Corona to Chino just to eat at Min's. When the opened their second restaurant in Corona, we were there. As a person with chinese blood, this is the best chinese food in Corona. We've tried almost everything on the menu and everything is good. It's a family tradition to come here every New Year and Chinese New Year. I recommend the whole steamed fish. It takes a little while to cook so order it first.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Delicious food and great service is what keeps us coming back every time. The garlic green beans and walnut shrimp are to-die-for. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

I love Min's Dumpling House! They have quick and polite service, the food is delicious, and the place is clean and welcoming. Try the Juicy Dumplings or the Beef Roll, the Kung Pao, or anything! My personal favorite are the sweet Red Bean Bun dumplings...so good!</review>

<response>None</response><Review>Living in Riverside, you get used to doing with out. With out nice clothing shops, with out beach weather, with out great restaurants... Mins dumpling house is one of the better places to eat in the ie (assuming you like dumplings.) The reason for the 3 that I feel the menu could have more dumplings and less other dishes. I come here semi regularly, and unfortunately I am stuck ordering the same dishes every time.

The establishment is small, and very tidy!! This is a big plus.

While I only give Mins a 3, I do highly recommend it. If you've never had a juicy dumpling before, you're missing out!!!

Until next time...< /Review>< userid>

First mistake, ordered 1 hour in advance, of course the food was expected cold, but surprise at the small portion size relative to the price paid.  Unlike  other Chinese gigs that include a fortune cookie, this place included a live cockroach.  Yikes!  Lesson learned from ordering in advance.  Never again.<//text>

Couldn't go inside to order our meal at all. You can only order using their drive thru. The cashier had a pleasant demeanor. Most if our order was correct except my burger. Make a long story short, they re-made my burger and pitched in a couple of cookies for the miss hap. Other than that, really good staff, meal was hot and quick.<//review>

The food was great, hot, and fast. The restaurant was clean orderly and maintained. But perhaps most importantly, they saw that we were truckers and opened the doors for us... I can definitely say McDonald's doesn't do. Thanks you again crew for your help.</text>< pictures>

Very clean and friendly. But to use the restroom you need a 7 number code.  A little over the top<//review>

<Text>Always a pleasurable experience at this location no matter who is working and quite fast too ...even late at night when everyone gets the munchies at the same time and it ends up being 5 or more cars pulling up at the same time to order. Im always happy to see the polite yet joking night crew guy there. Im very impressed with his ability to multitask and get my order hot fresh and correct</Text>< pics>

Half my order was missing and I didn't notice until I drove all the way back home to Lincoln. I tried to call but no one answered the phone so I ended up having to drive all the way back and thank God they gave me a receipt to prove that I paid because many times they don't. Have also had bad service at Carl's Jr. in Lincoln so this seems to be a trend with this restaurant< /Review>

They have pretty good food and some of the fastest service I've had at Carl's Jr.

Though I have to mention an employee Harrison for his awesome service. Makes us smile every time and a great sense of humor.</review>

We are the generation, that wasted very little.
In other countries we are considered very wasteful people. Even the rich does not waste what Americans do.
That said, we enjoy BURGER'S at Carl's Jr. restaurants. My wife's favorite is the western bacon cheese BURGER and my favorite is the super star without cheese.
The service is generally very good to excellent range and BURGER'S are very good for the cost.
All Carl's Jr. Are not the same. We went to another location in Vacaville outlets Area and the service was questionable.
This was our first visit and she seemed occupied with her conversation with other employees. We may have caught her on a bad day? I doubt that we will ever find out because we have no plans to return.< /Text>< Pictures>

Harrison who works around 2am graveyard shift made our visit enjoyable and extraordinary. I must commend him with his dedication and willingness to make every customer feel valued. He made our night just for asking” only if you smile” 😊 keep it up and I hope other crew will learn from his outstanding/5 star service. Keep smiling Harrison. 👍👍👍😊<//Review>

Carl Jr's sausage, egg and cheese biscuit is by far the best around. Why? Because of the biscuit alone. Good service too. Only negative-interior and bathroom need to be updated.</Review>

<Review>I live five minutes from there. My burger was cold when I got home. I ordered a charbroiled guacamole Burger. I can't stand jalapenos but yet they were all over in my burger because of the guacamole. If I would have known that I would never had ordered it. It is the size of a McDonald's regular hamburger. So disappointing.<//Review>< resp>

Carl's Jr. has a huge selection of burgers and other misc items. Kind of pricey but well worth it. Give them a try and I think you like it.<//review>

I couldn't decide if I wanted a taco salad or a supreme nachosI ended up with the supreme nachos and the meat and beans were very bland like they were not seasoned it all. even though the manager was absolutely amazing I have to give him five stars he was very helpful and kind but the food just was not on point< /text>< userid>

Fast service. Relatively clean inside. Food was a little underwhelming, especially with the tiny sizing on the chicken All-Star meal. Can't go wrong with the simple Spicy Chicken sandwiches though.<//Review>

This guy is insane and he's always here. I just watched a poor woman get told she dropped her change clearly not her fault. Now we get told to pull up because they are waiting for the meat. 3 people sitting parked in the front because they cannot keep up on the meat. Poor service< /review>

If I could give this place 0 stars, I would they need to be reported.  Went there today with my mom around 11pm because we were on our way to visit my sister at the hospital and my mom was hungry.She ordered a meal and I only ate a few fries. An hour after eating it I began to get really gassy. Here it is 3am and my mother is vomiting and having diarrhea because of them !! I called, told them what happened and the guy who answered said “idk nothing about that then hangs up” tried again multiple times no answer smh. Guess I need to call the people above them and get them REPORTED!<//Text>

The manager here is so stupid! We asked to void the transaction so we can pay him with a debit card but he said the it will hurt his company to void out transaction and be paid in a different way. I do not think he knows how to void a transactions and wants to just give us $5.00 back, but we want to pay for our food. Not only did he belittle us but he argued with us. I will never go back to this location manager doesn't know what he is doing and very rude! I guess he doesn't think bad reviews will hurt his store, so dumb, need a new manager.< /text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>This particular Carl's Jr sucks. The burgers are dry, the workers are rude and the fries taste like they were recycled and thrown into the greaser for a couple minutes. The Carls Jr off of Stanford Ranch over by the mall is way better. If I am going to shell out 10 plus dollars for a meal, the food shouldn't taste like dry cardboard and the service better be professional.<//review>< pics>

Always is good food, just expect to have a 15 min delay in the drive thru. Also, burgers are missing certain parts and bread is hard. Still worth it to eat here tho.<//text>
