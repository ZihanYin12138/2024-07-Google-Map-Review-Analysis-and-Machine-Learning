Our group of six when to the Islander three days in a row.   We all agree the the food is exceptional.  Those who had the fish and chips said is was the best they have had.  The mussels were fantastic.  We tried many items on the happy hour menu and enjoyed everything.  It is a great place.</Text>

<text>This is THE best place we ate at on our entire San Diego trip. Don't let its outward appearance fool you, that food is tasty. I cleared my entire plate. The staff was super friendly and even suggested some other places for us tourists to check out. Excellent selection of fish, and cooked to perfection.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

My family was staying close by for a short vacation and we walked by Islander several times before we worked out a time to stop in. Now we are kicking ourselves that we didn't come sooner. The options you have when you come here are incredible. The quality of fish, the taste, and the overall experience are amazing. You cannot go wrong here (I personally recommend the lemon dill butter on grilled fish or the tempura fish and chips with horseradish tarter sauce).</review>

It is a quaint little place, but their selection of fish is what brought me in. I had their fish & chips with Alaskan cod...best fish & chips I've had in the US. Neither needed anything put on them, but the plate included a double-horseradish tartar sauce that was awesome (avoid if you don't like horseradish though). Even though you order from a counter, the staff is friendly and really take care of you. I would definitely come here again.</Review>

That was easily the best most relaxed seafood experience we have had in our nine weeks in the USA. Do yourself and anyone else you care about a favour and shoot on down to Coronado. Our grilled fish plates Cod for myself and Sea Bass for my partner were perfect size and perfect selection of vegetables. Service was regardless of whether we had just stepped in from the beach or not. Thanks guys. You will not be forgotten. You are welcome in Australia any time</Text>< Time>

Service was decent.

However the food was TERRIBLE... I ordered the swordfish plate and spent $25 thinking I was spending too much but I'm so close to the ocean and the fish must be THAT good, right? NO! The swordfish plate was served to me on a paper plate with the driest piece of fish I've ever eaten.

This is my first review I've written ever. I want people to know that this place is a waste of time and money so you too don't think you're getting a 4/5 star reviewed restaurant like I thought I was.< /Review>

I brought a group of 17 people - including 7 children, with only 10 minutes notice.  They had our tables set and ready.  It was a great experience for everyone.  The people were friendly and took care of everything so quick.  The food was AWESOME.  I loved the Yellowtail fish and chips.  The Shrimp and chips and that they had a child's menu.  The deep fried pickles and the amazingly different tarter sauce and tangy ketchup were a fun change.<//Text>

The food was good, but certainly not worth the price.  My wife had the "Fish 'N Chips" with the local cod, and I had the "Grilled Fish Plate" with the yellowtail.  We wouldn't dine there again.<//Review>

<Text>Friendly service. Yummy food. Awesome location.

Attending a seminar in San Diego, my wife and I had a brief lunch break. Look, we get to stare at the Ohio River all year. So, instead of hanging around the hotel and conference room any longer, we made a dash to Coronado.

Maybe it's not big deal for the locals, but us mid-westerners need to gobble up ocean views whenever we can!

And, we needed to gobble up some viddles. So, my wife pulls out Yelp on the way, and we the safe bet - go with the highest rated restaurant on Coronado ... there's a reason why.

It was Sunday afternoon. The weather wasn't great, a bit cloudy, so the Islander wasn't slammed. But, we were greeted by a wonderful hostess/waitress, who was extremely friendly. First, she told me I didn't need to pay the meter (which I had missed), then, she knew we were in a hurry and got our fish and chips order in right away. While it was getting ready, she prepped us to go with to go cups and the bill.

When the food came out, the chef (owner?), gave us a pro tip and said, "hey, it's fried. The sooner you open these styrofoam containers, the better it will be." Now, I should know that after years of takeout, but what a friendly and thoughtful tip! This guys was saying, "my food is really good. Here's how to get the most out of it if you are getting it to go."

And, it was delicious! The curry ketchup on the fries ... awesome! My wife hates ketchup, and she gobbled it all up. The horeradish tartar sauce, yum! The cod was fantastic and the pumpkin seed slaw great on the side.

A little pricey for what we normally pay ... but, that comes with the territory on Coronado. If you're going to pay premium, get the best. Go to the Islander!<//Text>< pics>

Down-to-earth place to eat with great prices on their version of a fish taco. House-made pickled carrots and cucumbers.<//text>

To start your day paying bills you NEED Quality Customer service it's a PLUS. I got the quality this morning @ my public storage from Ms.Tiana.The $$$$ out of my pocket didnt hurt as much. This is not a knock on the other STAFF @ALL (SUPERB). Smile!!! It's about this day. NOT walking away shaking my head.< /Review>

I had a issue with a lock that became slighly rusted and made it difficult to open. I went into the office and explained the situation and the young lady at the counter came to my storage unit immediately to not only help get the storage open but to exchange my lock for a new one. I am very pleased and cannot imagine my valuables being stored anywhere else.<//review>< Pictures>

Not happy at all, hours of access are no good people are just getting off work around that time. Place is a little dirty and cleanliness is very important as a business. I wouldn’t want to store equipment here. Moving on to next place.< /text>

I've been coming to this Public Storage for years now and I absolutely love the customer service. Recently, the property manager has been accommodating to my needs quite efficiently and not to mention she is friendly. The property itself is always clean, quiet, and easy to access. I've really enjoyed the new key entry as well!< /Review>

<text>I had excellent service with Ronny! He was timely and explained everything perfectly and was very informative. I love someone with a good attitude and great service and who is willing to explain detail by detail about the storage. Step by step he was very knowledgeable about the process and talkative and personable. Great service and he really helped me in my time of need.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

< Review>
Came to visit this property inquiring about a space and the manager on duty Bertha was very sweet and informative as far as giving me prices for a unit. I loved her great service and she was very professional and made me feel comfortable about renting a storage for the first time! The property looks to be clean and well mannered and Bertha again was a sweetheart I would recommend her service at this property!< /Review>

Hello. My name is Lakeisha Page and I am a client of this particular storage facility. The staff here is amazing!  Not only has it been a convenient and clean place to store my things during my relocation, but I faced some hardship during my tenure as a client. Bertha, one of the managers, patiently assisted me in order to assess all the options available in order to keep me as a client and my valuable “treasures” safe and sound. I utilized the resources she gave and am still a client. The staff here, including the general manager, made me feel as important to them as a client as maintaining my  hinge stored is to me! Exceptional customer service. Forever grateful !</text>

Jennifer and Samantha took VERY good care of me and eased much of the stress of moving! They are BOTH an important and valuable asset for Public Storage! From showing me various size spaces (I chose a LARGE ONE!) to handling the sign-up and handing me the keys to my new unit... I could not have had a better experience! If you need storage space, this is where you want to go!<//review>

Let me start by mentioning Jennifer S. accommodation for a unit......Quick and fast came so easy!
She went above and beyond to get me set up with a unit, while giving pointers on how to avoid late fees...
I feel like I got the BEST deal for the money....
Kudos to Jennifer S.....I'll Will do business again!< /text>

It's our first time to rent a storage unit.  I reserved a unit online, and they called us to made an appointment to view the unit.  Jennifer is the one who help us.  She is very nice and made the process quick and easy.  Unfortunately, the second day, we don't need the unit anymore because our problem.  Jennifer is very nice to help us.  If next time I need a unit, this location will be our first choice.  Recommended!  :)< /review>

It's my first time at this and I was referred to this public storage by a friend that has a space there also. Clean facility and customer  service is amazing!  I especially  want to shout out Ms. Jennifer for making this process a piece of cake and recommending  everything  I need to make sure my things are good! I bought  a pack of boxes for the low low I would most definitely recommend  this facility.  You girl! with yo cute self;)</Review>

<Text>Nice clean Location 🎉.
Jennifer was very  informative.
Very easy and understanding process.
She was very knowledgeable & she was extremely patience with me.👍
Keep in mind this is my first time ever having to use a storage.
You can imagine all my questions I asked.
Jennifer sealed the deal. I'll be referring this location to all my colleagues and business partners. Thank you< /Text><user>108989409778556948699< /user>< resp>

I love this location clean, friendly, nice property. Jennifer was the nice employee that helped me. She was everything, she explained everything, she made sure I had the rate size storage and supplies I needed to protect my things from breaking. She has excellent customer service. I was nervous about putting my things there she insured me and made me feel comfortable about the security level so I was OK.< /Review>

Jasmine was a great help. Great customer service. She showed me 2 different units and I wasn't sure if I wanted them but she reassured me that I will be satisfied with a 10x10. The property overall is clean and well put together. Security is well provided with along with daily checks and carts.< /Text>

Samantha Serrano was awesome, professional and polite.  I had a random issue that was a little annoying and had been ongoing for a week or so, when I called back the property this time Samantha went above and beyond to help me.  I was supposed to call her back but totally forgot and she followed up with me just to inform me that everything was done and to make sure I was all set and satisfied.  She definitely went above and beyond!  Good customer service like this is rare so she deserves more than 5 stars!  Thank you Samantha!<//text>

I recently got a storage from Jennifer at Public Storage.  She is amazing!  She is professional, patient and she always gives you a smile.  She worked things out for me, so that I received the best deal.  Go in and ask for Jennifer.</Review>

<Review>service is very courteous and professional Jennifer and Yolanda are second to none always, so helpful going that step beyond. I called over a month ago about the security situation at this locality so far nothing has been done how can decision be made about the safety of your employees when you don't work under these conditions you took away the alternative door as well as the security glass . Look into this matter.  Thank You Patricia Murphy< /Review>< Pictures>

Great customer service!! Before stopping at this public storage  tried out a few other places and the service i received here is no comparison to the others. Employee Myesha Hill displayed great customer service to me and my friend. She was very helpful made sure all of our needs were met. Great example of exceeding beyond customers measures for customer service.< /Review>

I received excellent service from the first time I walked in. This was my first time ever utilizing a public storage facility. Yasmine was fantastic. She was very thorough in explaining the entire process for my understanding. I encourage all to come in if you require additional storage space.< /text>

<user>111588598631943527121< /user><text>Jennifer is very helpful. She really took the time to explain everything about the self storage process bc this was my first time. She also walked me to my unit and explained what amenities were available, like hand carts to help move items and the restrooms on site. She's really a sweet person and good at communication. She calls me if there are any issues regarding my two storage units and works with me if I have a scheduling issue. I cannot thank her enough with helping me out with this stressful process.<//text>< Pics>

Very professional staff, Yolanda is the best customer service representative I have encounter in months, her attitude towards her customers is second to none. She is courteous and takes the time to listen and to answer any questions.
The location is clean and up-kept...however... the only flaw I see is your business hours, I feel 5:pm is toooo early to close your gates, sometimes I needed to retrieve items from my storage unit and due to your closing schedule I was unable to do it.

< Review>
I was in your store a few days ago and I just wanted to let you guys know what a pleasure it was to be helped by Yolanda!  I am new to the area and she was so helpful and understanding.  I was looking to rent a certain size unit and sadly there wasn't one available at that time.  She showed me what was available though.  All the units were very clean and maintained.  For this to be a storage place I was very impressed.  I tried some other storage places in the area and they were nowhere near as clean and their employees didn't seem to care about what my needs were.  Yolanda went out of her way to try and find what I was looking for at some of your other area facilities too.  I'll be checking back with Western Ave to see if one becomes available and also letting anyone that I know that needs storage to go to PS on Western and ask for Yolanda!!!!!< /Review>

The manager in the office is beyond rude!!! She does not listen to the concern of the customer and cuts you off and has even closed the door in my face. I don't buy all of the praises for Jennifer because I have seen up close how nasty she is. The bathrooms are a mess!!! Smelly and trashy. The bldg smells and there's a guy that hangs around like he works there looking like a thug. This property is not a good choice!! The district manager does not respond to calls so don't waste your time!!<//review>

<review>JENNIFER is very informative & has great customer service & helpful. I'm disable and on oxygen and she has great patience with me.  Samantha However when I called to check on my account was very unprofessional and not listing she wanted to over talk when I asked about my autopay concern. Samanth told me if I didn't want to pay I could move my stuff out My finance came to place items inside the space and he spoken to Samantha about the elevator not working she told him to go around to the other elevator she told him didn't want to reset it or check on it I was on my walker waiting for access to go up..  I have the correct address on file I don't know why I didn't receive my letter about the rate increase and I'm currently waiting for a response from the district manager. I was refered to public storage and I'd like to keep my location if the price is right.  I'm hoping when I come down to the location Jennifer will be working she is wonderful.</review>< pictures>

Hello, I am a existing customer me and my husband, have been renting my storage here for a couple years now. Although Public Storage has an high turnover staff such as Myesha Hill has always been extremely polite and enthusiastic about their jobs. Since we have been renting here a while I have seen pros and con here. Cons such as the elevator on grounds doesn't work, while its down more time than not, which is such an inconvenience to us and, other customers. Also, the gate hour need to be extended until a later time. I pay to store my property on your facility. I should be able to access my belonging as long as it is an reasonable time at 6pm which is the time the storage close the sun is up. I understand the security reason but, still come on. That does make me feel like my property is very safe and secure.</Text>

Stopped by today to buy some more boxes from Jennifer.
However as I waited over 20 to maybe 30 min's for someone to arrive to the office it wasn't a sign nor note  left for arrival time I left and came back. I went to check the door one more time before I go else where to buy my packing item's I noticed someone inside this time. It wasn't Jennifer it was a different lady in the office she had the lights off and didn't even greet me when I walked in. I didn't feel safe to be inside an business in the dark I left.
Unsure if the power was out or it was nap time. This isn't a way to conduct an business. I passed may of other storage places to get to this location. I only come here where I know I'm welcome by a smiling face every time However today wasn't the day.</review>

nasty , rude, and has a HORRIBLE  attitude. She's very unprofessional and she runs that property as if it's a low income housing project the batgroom is NASTY , and you can NEVER get in contact with anyone from the corporate office.

When arriving I was warmly greeted. The employee Myesha assisted me and exhibited a vase knowledge of the job, she provide premium customer service and was cheerful, happy and energetic. She made it a pleasure to spend my money at Public Storage. I would recommend Gardena Public Storage to all my friends. Because with that customer service I am certain my property is in amazing hands.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>The manager Jennifer had the worst attitude in the world. She's very nasty unprofessional and she runs that property as if it's a low income housing!!!! She has her boyfriend walking around the property and it looks like a scene from Boyz in the Hood & you can NEVER get in contact with anyone from the corporate office. If you like drama your store your stuff here and if you don't you'll go elsewhere<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I went in to look for a storage big enough for a 3 bedroom. Yolanda was quite knowledgeable and showed me a couple storages. Though i wasnt able to get the unit,she armed me with many choices with public storage in the gardena area. Professional and friendly staff< /text>

< Review>
My car was broken into and the drivers window was completely smashed. After searching high and low and comparing prices, not only did Salvador's Auto Glass respond the fastest but they offered the best price! Everyone was so friendly and they had us in and out in less than half an hour. I highly recommend this business<//Review>

I’ve came here before about 2 years ago and they did really good work, but I came recently and while taking off my old windshield they ripped my wrap on my car and peeled the paint while in the process they were not careful. Also my brother went same week and same thing they broke his side pillar and tried to glue it back on and now it looks so bad! Next time I’m going somewhere else.<//text>

I live in kind of a rough area, so auto break-ins happen a lot. There are auto glass repair and window replacement shops all over this part of Southern California, so I had plenty to choose from. I went to Salvador’s Auto Glass because it was the closest to my apartment and man, they gave me a great deal and it only took about 45 minutes to install the new front passenger window. Super fast and affordable!< /Review>

<text>My rear panel was busted out and Salvador’s Auto Glass was the first place I called. I drove down to their auto glass shop and was in and out within an hour. I didn’t even ask (because I didn’t even think about it), but they matched the existing window on the opposite side’s tint! That was a super nice touch!

I was beginning to get frustrated after calling a few shops in the LA area and not getting any solid answers on prices. Salvador’s had no problem getting me a firm auto glass replacement quote, so I went down with them. I couldn’t be happier with the quality of work and the price simply can’t be beaten!<//review>

If you need to get your window fixed in a hurry, these are your guys! Salvador’s Auto Glass has a large staff of friendly technicians working hard so that you don’t have to wait long for your windshield repair. Plus, I haven’t found lower prices in the area … at least not for quality, guaranteed work.< /Text>

<review>Apparently, there is a frozen paint-ball bandit doing drivebys in LA! They hit my car and one of the frozen pellets actually cracked my window near the edge. Unfortunately, because it is right on the seal it can’t be repaired but Salvador’s Auto Glass gave me a spectacular deal on new windshield replacement! They were really nice and although they seemed really busy were able to get me in for an appointment just a day later.</review><user>102026219266920494960< /user></record></dataset><record>

I called Salvador’s Auto Glass and they were able to schedule me for an appointment quickly. It only took them about 30 minutes to patch up the holes with some quality auto glass repair resin.

My window motor on the passenger side stopped working. My car is 11 years old so something was bound to happen.. lol.. Anyway I brought it to Salvador's Auto Glass on Alameda and they did a great job. They were the first place I stopped, coming from Florence Ave it's so convenient. They fixed it in 30 minutes and I was on my way back home to Downtown LA.</Text>

Bad service, bad installation. After two days after windshield had been installed drove through a car wash and water started coming in through inside of my car almost  damaging my electrical and wetting my fuse box - car engine light went on as well as my gear shifting started making a bad sound when attempting to shift gear due to water damage so I had a hell of a night and couldn’t Move my car but was advised by my mechanic to not move car and turn on heater and let water get dried with inside heater or else the damage to the electrical and fuse box was going to be a lot so I did as instructed per my mechanic and managed to dry out the water after two hours while sitting in car at car wash which I had never in my life experiences such a bad situation all sue to these people not properly installing the windshield properly and to also mention to the public that’s reading my review that while they were installing my windshield on the day they did it another customer came back to them with the same problem complaining to them that their car was experiencing water coming in but I didn’t pay attention to that warning of noticing they had already done a bad job to someone else because I never thought that water could be such a problem if it went inside your car after a bad windshield installation but I was told by my mechanic that water going in your car due to bad windshield installation can actually cause  electrical problems and ruin your car computer so after that I  called owner on the next day and lady was very rude not admitting the bad installation so I went to another windshield business and they spotted the bad installation and explained to me about the way they did a bad installation and that these people that installed my windshield broke some clips and did a horrible job. So I went back to Salvador’s auto glass and the owner grabbed a hammer and without my consent out of no where decides to hit my windshield braking the glass they had badly installed without asking me permission to do such a thing or even mentioning she was going to do this. I think she (the owner)  should have at least  notified me about what she was going to do if she planned on hitting my windshield again but no, this woman goes to my car with a hammer, slams it on the windshield and says give me your receipt so I did and then gives me back my money and says get out of here !!! So I then told her to give me back a copy of the receipt as she should’ve done showing the return or refund, for me to keep receipt as proof in case my car might have suffered any type of damage caused by the water that went in through the windshield but she refused to give me a copy of receipt and I mentioned to her about her action being wrong and that instead she should have taken her windshield off my car and brake it or so whatever she decided but on the floor not while the windshield is still on my car because that is called vandalizing your own personal property, she could’ve damaged my paint or caused more damaged by slamming a hammer to my car!! lady was extremely rude and I will never go back to any of those shop
On alameda specially her shop because at themes it cost me two days of work  water damage so I advise anyone to preferrelly pay a little more somewhere else but at least with the right people  Salvador’s auto glass does not know how to install windshields properly as I previously mentioned another mad customer came while they were installing mine with the same issue.*** I’d like to add a few more notes to my review, however one day after I started writing my review I look car to another shop that knows how to properly install glass and it turns out that after taking salvadora auto glass windshield off my car they discovered that they did a horrible job. First of all broke off all my clips and switched my original top molding to one that wasn’t for this car, then most importantly the glue they used has not dried till this day
They used cheap glue<//text>

I just replaced the side passenger window on my Honda Element. I first called the dealer of course but they were very expensive ($400). These guys had the window in stock and were way below that price. I am happy with the way it came out.</Review>

<review>I have a dress!!! I was having the hardest time finding a knee- or tea-length white dress that still looked bridal. I was thrilled to find such a good selection at Simply Bridal. Luckily, I live close to their showroom and was able to visit twice in person to try on some options. I was immediately impressed by the quality of the dresses for the price. After my first appointment, they helped me make a second one so I could return with my mom and sister to make a final decision. One of the great things about dresses at Simply Bridal is that many of their short dresses are actually bridesmaid dresses in white (with no markup!). When I was at the showroom, the white sample of my dress was too small, but I was able to try on the exact same dress in my size in black. It was perfect-- the standard size fit me like a glove, so I didn't need to have the dress custom-made. I was also able to order a matching plain sash, and both the dress and sash arrived in about a month. The fit and quality are exactly what I saw in the showroom. I can't express how thrilled I was to find a place like Simply Bridal. Highly recommended!< /review><rating>5<//rating>< date>

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Erika was very sweet and made me feel very comfortable. She listened to what I was looking for in a dress and pulled several styles that I really liked. I ended up finding my dress here and am very excited. The boutique is very cute and they offer champagne and water while you wait. They also have great discount options if you find the right dress during your first appointment.< /Text>

When I got there, people were so happy and they were very welcoming. I have not seen any other place like that. I was going to get some ideas then I will decide from which store I should my ultimate wedding dress. It turned to be the nicest place with nicest people who helped me to choose. They did not force me to buy neither they did not push certain model to try. They showed me different ones and I tried them on which helped me to make my decision. I was so happy about their offering to help me to fit on me so I get the right impression about the dress. I was so extremely recommended to all people to go and check it out. They have pretty dress  models and bridesmaid dresses. They give discount if you are going to buy for the bridesmaids too. The employee are lovely people; they are amazing! It is worth the time and effort to go and check the store out!< /Review>

I had a wonderful experience with Simply Bridal. I used just about every one of their services including the Try-at-Home and I have a more detailed review on yelp if you want to hear about it. All the ladies at Simply Bridal were courteous and helped me along the way. Lauren was especially great and a big help in the showroom and on the phone.
I love the dress I bought (Jasmine) and it arrived clean and well sewn within about 60 days. The satin is beautiful and heavy. The dress was a phenomenal deal and I would do it again! Simply Bridal made my wedding day a little less stressful by making a beautiful dress available to me. I was skeptical about online dress shopping but Simply Bridal is the real deal!
Good luck!< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>I had a great experience at Simply Bridal. My consultant was fantastic, we discussed what I was looking for, and her first pull ended up being the dress for me. We tried on several others - but kept going back to the first. This may sound silly, but they way they cinch the dresses was super helpful -- I'm very petite and so I can have a hard time imagining what the dresses will look like when they are the right size, but they did a much better job pinning the dress than other places I had visited --which allowed me to get that feeling of the dress better. The sample dresses were all very clean and in nice condition, and the store was very clean and cute. I have to wait for September for my dress to come in -- but overall the experience has been great thus far!<//Text>< rating>

<text>I must admit I never stressed about the day I went wedding dress shopping... This was honestly my first pick to find "THE" dress. I actually flew from Michigan to Los Angeles to explore the Simply Bridal showroom because I had to see how everything looked on me. When I arrived I felt like all eyes were on me and was center of attention! This was an amazing feeling walking into my FIRST bridal boutique. Everyone was so honest, patient, kind and just simply FUN!!! Those were all the aspects I wanted in my wedding dress experience. I want to say I tried on OVER 10 dresses and felt right at home... I will say I finally got down to 2 dresses and it was a split with everyone and we were able to facetime my mother who began to cry seeing me in this moment.. The ladies just joined right in greeting my mother as if she were in the room... I was blessed to have been able to hold the sign with my future wedding dress saying "SHE SAID YES!" with my best friend standing right beside me.

If you are looking for a once in a lifetime experience shopping for your wedding dress while being the MOST elegant bride any man has EVER seen...This is truly the place to go!</text>< pics>

Went into this store with no appointment and was extremely satisfied! I had originally had a dress on order at David’s Bridal and after going back and forth with them in regards to fittings and dates for my dress to arrive I decided to cancel my order with them. The follows weekend me and my mom and one of my bridesmaids went looking and I can say I was discouraged! Then we found Simply Bridal and we planned on just looking. I end up finding my dream dress for 460.00 I am so excited for my wedding in June I do have to get alteration but overall my experience was great!!!!!!<//text>

<Review>We went looking for dresses today. The girl that helped us was a joy. The guy behind the counter was the best. The other girl had a standing stank face the entire time we were there. We didn't let her ruin our good time but having her glare our way wasn't pleasant. The choice of dresses was great. Only thing I would have liked was if the bride was able to browse and pick out a few of her own dresses. Doesn't seem to make complete sense for the store to choose for her. It's her day. However the girl assigned to us was very accommodating. She listened, gave a little advice and most important was patient. Very much appreciated that.

For bridesmaids the selection seemed small and uneventful. It was off on another part of the store crammed on this small rack. It was hard to go through them. Felt like I was shopping the clearance rack at Kmart.

All in all it was worth the trip. We had a great time and would definitely recommend it.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

So happy that I decided to come here! I found the one and I can't wait for my wedding day to come! This was the third Bridal store that I bee to and It should have been the first! Prices are great here and they stay in your budget range. Everyone is super nice and friendly. Have to come back and see the bridesmaid selection when I have more time.</Text>

<Review>I have received my dress last week and noticed it was slightly too tight. I contacted the showroom, and they advised me to take the dress to let them see how they can fix it. The store manger was being super helpful and kind. She was able to help me fix the size and rush my shipment. I love this superb customer service. I will definitely recommend my friends to there.< /Review>< Pics>

We came in earlier than our appointment and they were able to take us. We had an awesome bridal consultant, Maxx. He was really energetic, fun, with a great sense of humor that made the experience that much greater! It was our first place for a dress fitting and I was able to find a dress that I loved at an affordable price. He took his time with us and made the experience so enjoyable. He was very competent in this line of work and I was really happy that I came here.< /review>

Even though I did not actually purchase my wedding dress from them, I did have dresses shipped to my home to try on. Customer service was top notch via chat and via phone. The dresses that I did try on at home, I loved. However, I actually went to a local shop to get measured so that I could order the correct size. Well, my dad went with me and wanted me to try on dresses. I did and found the perfect dress for me. I would like to thank Simply Bridal for making a stressed bride feel at ease and provided great customer service.</Text>

A big thank you and shout out to Chrissy! She made the experience memorable. I can't wait till my dress arrives in the mail!!!

While being engaged I started celebrating by eating tons of bad food and drinking lots of alcohol to the point that I gained enough weight not to fit onto my first wedding gown. 2 months away from my wedding date I started searching the web and visited a few local bridal stores, with no luck. I was so desperate I picked out a few CHEAP $ gowns to try on before my appointment at simply bridal, you get to choose 5. As soon as I walked into the store from the glass windows I spotted something shinny in the distance and I was instantly drawn to it. I had a few minutes to walk around the store and look at the dresses while my personal helper got a room ready for me to get started. The first dress I tried on was the cute shinny dress I had spotted when I walked in and I felt amazing! They have so many different sizes that you truly wont feel like there isn't an option for you at this store. The dress was a bit out of my budget but they gave me an instant discount and are willing to work with you when it comes to payments. Since my wedding is coming up soon, they charged a $25 dollar rush fee which was so cheap compared to other places! I highly recommend this place, thank you for helping me find my perfect gown in such short time.< /review>

I absolutely adored this place. As soon as you walk in everyone is so friendly, Haley is the one that helped me and she was so adorable and so helpful!! I truly felt cared about, and as it was my first time dress shopping i was nervous and wasn't sure about what styles i liked she was very patient with me. All of the ladies there helped pitch in different styles and gave great feedback. I felt so special and the fact that i am getting married felt so real and special trying on those dresses. They really have a great variety and selection of dresses with great prices. They have such cute accessories. Such an unforgettable experience, definitely recommend!

-Love future Mrs. Vandendries ♡< /review>

<Text>Thank you! I bought my dress (the Larissa gown) online (I live in Michigan) and cannot be happier with it. The packaging and directions kept the dress safe and secure. I cannot wait for my wedding day and will be able to put it back in the vacuum packaging afterwards to keep it safe. It is a stunning beauty and have been told it suits me so well. The materials are definitely worth the cost. At other places, I was looking at dresses three times the cost. Thank you for helping me make my wedding day a winter wonderland.</Text>< GmapID>

I have had a bad experience with another dress company on-line and was a little leary about using another one.  I found a great dress with Simply Bridal and wanted to do the "Try at Home" option.  I did this and it was fantastic!  I got 2 dress' to try on and they were both awesome.  I fell in love with one and will be ordering it very soon.
I called customer service and they were great; answered promptly, helpful and kind.

The price of the dress that I like went up while I thought about ordering this dress (quite a bit actually).  So that was depressing but Simply Bridal did offer a small discount to help.  So far.... I'm happy with what I see with Simply Bridal.</Text>

I haven't bought my dress yet, but I ordered a 'Try-at-Home' dress and loved it!! It is well made out of quality material.
Make sure you can send it back within the required time you order it, as mine arrived within 3 days, when I was expecting 2-3 weeks. That way you don't have a rush to try to get all the ideas or people critiquing it at unexpected times. :)<//review>

I couldn't be more disappointed with both the service and quality. When selecting a dress I tried a sample size 6 and it was huge. Had to be held on by clips. The streamstress came over and measured me as a 6. Which couldn't be the case. I typically wear size 0-2. They did this so they could purposefully upcharge alterations. I spent $700 on the dress and $1100 on the alterations. When I got the dress back there were holes in the lace sleeves. I hardly recognized it the whole garmet looked so tortured. I can't believe I spent this much money for a dress I will be ashamed to wear at my wedding.<//Text>

As soon as I entered the store and met the girls at the reception, I had already a good feeling about it. I have less than 2 months to be ready with the wedding arrangements, so selecting a dress and having the fitting done is quite a challenging thing to do when you are short on time. Mo and Neakai selected the dresses, considering the delivery time, cost and my idea of what the dress should look like.
I fell in love with the first two dresses I tried on and selected one of them. That was it! Tears of happiness and the OMG-I-am-getting-married-for-real feeling. The dress arrived to me 3 days after that! It fitted perfectly, just needs adjustment of the length ( perfectly understandable).
I can't thank them enough for being such a fresh team and very helpful and delicate people.  Now I am looking forward to the big day :)</Text>

I love the showroom and Erikka was amazing. Just I need to warn you ladies, the parking garage is super difficult to find if you don't live near by or come here often. I parked in what I thought was the right one. Turns out I was wrong ended up paying $24 for parking because they couldn't validate my ticket.< /Text>

<review>I had a great experience here at first and Erikka was lovely and helpful in finding me a dress. The process was easy and I did not feel pushed. Erikka was patient and friendly through the whole process of choosing "the dress."

Unfortunately, I was promised my dress would arrive within 4 months of the order being placed and it never came.  I used the online customer service support at first to inquire about my order after it was supposed to arrive and was told my order was on hold and was never given an explanation before the representative left the conversation. Then, I called the store during normal business hours and it took a few tries to even get a hold of someone in the store. Once I was able to get through, I was told there was an delay with my order and my dress hadn't even been made yet. She told me they would rush my order but it would still take a couple months (probably because the dresses come from overseas).

At this point I was frustrated and not even excited about my dress so I asked for a refund.  The company returned my money, fortunately, but overall I was disappointed with the communication and how my order was handled.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7cb021a60dd:0xcd9c8dac5843b0bc< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very cute bridal shop. Dresses ranged from 99 to 2000 very inclusive in pricing. Also the staff goes above and beyond to help you. And the seamstress is an angel.</Review>

The selection of dresses was disappointing. All dresses had the same lace that was a bit crude looking, it reminded me of my grandma's curtains. Also the well meaning staff just kept bringing out the same type of dresses even when specifically told that it was not what we were looking for. Also they served sparkling wine out of those small plastic translucent cups, like the ones that you get at In nOut when you ask for water, lol.<//Review>

Sunday afternoon with my sisters and we walked in a bit skeptical of finding a dress. I had previous bad experiences at a few other places, and what I liked off the bat was the different styles that Chrissy picked out for me. I brought photos in case, but having someone help me close to my body size and figure really helped me gain confidence. l was immediately comfortable with Chrissy, even when my sister's oohh and aww'd all the dresses I tried, but didn't wow me. My little sister was a bit demanding and the ladies at Simply Bridal smiled and tried to find what she was suggesting they pull for me to try on. When we hadnt found anything after about 6 different dresses, styles werent working fir me, and I was about to give up, because a gal can only take so much "barbie", Chrissy said she had 1 more dress up her sleeve. Low and behold, it was The Dress!!! Glad to have found it and the price was right, after 20% off and all was good in bridal land!

Thanks ladiess for helping me find the Dress!

All in all the experience my friend and I had was a great one and I'd definitely recommend this store to anyone who wants to find a unique wedding dress that is not produced by the blood and tears of underpaid children.< /Text>

They are not helpful at all. My mom goes there regularly and never had complains before. The owners are never there now but they should know about this situation.<//text>< pictures>

<review>The lady working there always has a bad attitude. She threw my vegetables on the ground and damaged them and tried to put them back in the grocery bag as if I didn’t notice. So irresponsible and rude. She should know how hard it is to make money and during covid to NOT pick up food from the ground and put it in my bag.</review>< Pictures>

The lady that works there has a really bad attitude. She shouts on customers for no reason. Gives a very bad look.Had a very bad experience. My friends and i used to like going to this store because it’s nearby and has almost everything we need. Now we doubt going here.< /Text>

<Text>They have a decent size store for quick grocery shopping if you live in the eden shores area. However it is hard to find the entrance to this store if you follow the google maps instructions . The vegetables seem to be kind of old . Not a bad place if you need to quickly pick up some ethnic spices< /Text>< Pics>

It's a decent Indian store near our house, if you go to Costco Hayward this is very close so best to do both at once, they carry most of the items as other Indian stores but would love to see more items added</Review>

every time u go there, u will find that they r just doing business, no greeting, no smile, they do not care abt d customer. Even the price are different on the product still they go as per their price. I think they are taking advantage of being alone in this area for spices or indian stuff.<//text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>I've bought 2 suits from this place. So I brought some friends over and Sean wasn't as helpful as the first time I bought my suit. He is the only one working there. And measured one of my friends wrong. Once my friend tried his shirt on, it was way to big. We then tried to exchange it and Shawn said they don't do exchanges or returns once the shirt has been removed from it's plastic wrapper. Which is dumb because if he measured and said that certain size will fit obviously we trusted him and now we are stuck with shirts oversized that we cannot use or return. Be careful it seems he just want to sell and once it's sold he doesn't care about anything or anyone. It really sucks because a year ago when I bought my first suit he actually did a great job and now it's like he is just rushing thru customers selling them anything he can without actually making sure it fits right. Think twice before going and if you go make sure you know your size already. As far as jack. He is an amazing Tailor.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Highly recommend this place. Have been a couple times now each time Joe has been great. Knows my size just by looking, always finds the perfect match of suit, shirts and ties. On site tailoring is awesome...a magician
Great pricing too.< /review>

A very strong recommend for everyone. I bought 4 suits and they treated me like a king, Joe was the gentleman who helped me.  Leo, the owner made a point to talk to me and Jack, the tailor did perfect work.  If you need suits, this is place to go.< /Review>

Walked in & right away I was greeted at the door. Unlike some places I went to. It took them about 10-15 min to notice me or I had to ask for help. Art was the man that took care of me. Any questions I had he answered. He told me the specials they had. The 2 suits I tried on needed alterations. After purchasing the 2 suits they offered me a free tie, dress shirt, & socks. Great place with great attitude from their staff</text>

The selection, customer service and price points for every budget are without parallel. I found myself in need of a suit in a hurry due to the impending loss of my father at any given moment. They altered two suits, promised them in three days but completed the work in one day, knowing my precarious situation. I am forever grateful.< /review>

Surprisingly large selection of suits, ties, etc. Fabulous prices, for ties and sweaters in particular. The staff was nothing but courteous, warm, and helpful when I visited on Sunday. Couldn't ask for more. They certainly have my business.<//text>

I’m always treated very well and promptly when I visit the center. I’m very glad to leave with less pain or discomfort after my back and shoulders are treated. Gentle adjustments, stretch and massage is what’s provided for me. I’m very satisfied with the friendly staff and services I receive at the center</Review>

<text>To date,  I have  received about 10 chiropractic appointments  from Dr. Henshaw and have been very pleased with the way that I have been treated in all aspects.    I Specifically asked for no physical adjustments/cracking and that has been fully honored.  She has a number of skills she employs to adjust my body without causing me  pain.  In addition, she is a delight to spend time with!  She demonstrates a high level of professionalism, friendliness, and staying on task, simultaneously.  I also like it that she has her doctorate in chiropractic and also has received  training in the area of physical therapy.  I highly recommend her.  I  recently purchased 10 more sessions, giving me the best price I am able to get without insurance.</text>< pics>

Paisley Wellness center is terrific.  After my car accident I had some back pain, and my wife found this place on line.  When I couldn't make a mid-day appointment and the next one wasn't for a week, they managed to somehow accommodate me in the late afternoon of the same day - much appreciated.  The appointment itself was thorough, professional and very helpful.  I'm already looking forward to the next session.</text>

<Text>Meeting with Dr Paisley was a very different kind of Chiropractor visit  than I have experienced before.  She was very thorough talking with me about my conditions and history, took a lot of time treating me, was gentle with her hands on manipulations, which included massage. Gave me some exercises to help and seemed very knowledeable regarding body mechanics. I highly recommend her services.</Text>< pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Saw Dr. Henshaw about eight months ago for several treatments. She did wonders for me! Realized a couple of weeks ago I needed to go back for a long overdue "tune up" as my lower back had become quite painful. Am not surprised, after my first return visit I immediately felt much better. She is a miracle worker! Would not go to anyone else!</Review>< Pictures>

Awesome experience after my first visit, my pain has already decreased to a level that's tolerable. I will keep updating this review as I continue treatment. Dr Henshaw is great.< /review>

Love this place!  Jill and Tim have been my go to chiropractor and massage therapist for years.  Pain from accidents and the daily grind are washed away when I visit.  Pretty much visit twice a month now.

Almost gave 4 stars because the new payment system does not allow multiple visit per day with insurance.  Can't get a chiropractor appointment right before a massage anymore. Never been a problem before, but a huge inconvenience when an office visit is 40 minutes round trip drive time out of my way.<//text>

I was treated with the utmost care by Jessica Henshaw.  When I arrived I could barely walk without assistance and she diagnosed the problem and I'm currently under treatment to alleviate the pain.  And her treatment is helping a great deal.</text>

<review>These folks are Miracle workers.  GO see them.  From the front office staff to the chiropractors everyone was incredibly helpful and professional.  Dr. Henshaw took over an hour to meet with me and understand everything about my health history and problem areas.  She explained everything she did and I left feeling 10000 times better.  It's nice to see the CARE put back in healthcare.  there is ample parking and a wonderful relaxing atmosphere.  Just GO!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf1b88ce7d75d:0xa08c1501078e1a7b<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I've been a loyal patient for years, initially for Dr. Paisley's expert Chiropractic care for my back and neck, but over time she has expanded the clinic's range of services to include a unique mix of treatment modalities which work well for me.  I've made a routine of visiting at least once a month for muscle stim, adjustments, and acupuncture with Dr. Wells, whose incredibly relaxing treatments work wonders for my various aches, pains, and tendonitis (and stress!). The entire staff are warm and friendly, and the office is a happy place to visit.  I truly look forward to going because I always leave feeling great!<//Text>

Dr. Henshaw helped me out with a shoulder issue I had been dealing with for awhile. After three visit it felt as good as new! She explained everything for me and didn't cost a fortune! The office was clean, and in a good location. Thanks Dr. Henshaw!!</Text>

I was plagued with rashes and allergy symptoms (runny nose, sneezing, coughing etc) for over a year. Traditional treatment and medications only provided temporary relief. After a few visits with Dr. Wells those embarrassing rashes and the allergy symptoms are gone! Just in time for summer! I LOVE this place!< /text>

<text>good service here.  Jill does a good job of showing me how to work on myself and what I can do on my own.

She doesn't just do the same 4 body cracks no matter  what you tell her.  Thats my biggest complaint about previous chiro's.< /text>< pics>

I have been a patient of Dr. Paisley's for over 10 years.  She has helped me through a high risk pregnancy, anxiety, panic attacks, hypothyroidism, adrenal gland fatigue, several really bad lower back muscle pulls, recovery from 8 major surgeries (including 2 brainstem surgeries in the last 2 years), fibromyalgia, and a chronic facial pain disorder called Trigeminal Neuralgia.  My husband has been treated by her a few times when he pulled his back out.  And I have been taking my kids to see her for maintenance adjustments about twice a year since they were 5 and 3 years old (they are now 12 and 10 years old).  I get adjustments from Dr. Paisley twice a month and I get a massage at least once a month from either Tim Knutson or Gretchen.  But really, ALL of the massage therapists at Paisley Wellness Center are awesome!  Each one has their own style and depending on what my body needs, the gals who do the scheduling, always book me with the massage therapist who style of massage is exactly what my body needs at the time.  I have also seen the in house Acupuncture lady and she is awesome too!  She is very knowledgeable about all of the different pressure points of the body, takes the time to explain it all to you, and is just really a cool person to talk to.  My go to massage therapist is Tim.  He is really a neat guy to talk to.  We often end up laughing and joking throughout my whole massage.  He is able to find all of the knots in my muscles and loosen them up.  And I like that he incorporates a good amount of stretching towards the end of my session.  Plus, he can usually accommodate my husbands work schedule so that I can get a massage in the evenings at 630pm when my husband can be home to watch the kids.

But Dr. Paisley is the main reason why I have been a loyal patient for over 10 years.  She is knowledgeable about naturopathic ways to help heal the body.  She sells and can recommend supplements, nutrients, and essential oils to help heal your body.  She offers electric stimulation for your muscles before your actual session with her.  She shows you exercises and stretches that you can do at home to help keep you spine and hips aligned.  She has even donated gift certificates for massage for different fundraisers that my family has been involved with.  All of those are awesome benefits of being her patient.  But there are three huge reasons why I am such a loyal patient of hers. 1) She actually reads your chart BEFORE your appointment so she knows what's going on and she keeps meticulous notes about your concerns, health issues, and the treatment/areas she adjusted during each appointment. 2) She actually gives you a REALLY good mini massage to loosen up the muscles around your spine and hips before she does the actual adjustment.  So she never has to do a hard "Snap, Crackle, Pop" neck twisting/pulling kind of adjustment.  By the time she is done massaging me, she barely has to move my head and neck to one side and my spine easily pops back into alignment.  And for my mid and lower back, after her mini massage, she usually just has to put a little pressure on the area, using her "Super Thumbs" as I call them, and my vertebrae just easily snaps back into place.  And did I mention the relaxing mini massage?  3) She does work with certain health insurance plans that offer chiropractic coverage.  And for those of us who don't have chiropractic insurance, she offers a money saving pre-paid program.  Actually there is a money saving prepaid program for chiropractic care and one for massage care.  With the massage program I can afford to get 2 90 minute massages month for what it would cost me to get
just one 60 minute massage at a day spa.

I HIGHLY recommend The Paisley Wellness Center in Poway.<//Text>

<review>They did a great job replacing the driver side door on our Subaru, looks as good as new. The staff was very friendly and helpful. When I picked up the car I noticed the side mirror adjuster was not working properly so I took it right back and they were quick to fix it. They were super busy with a ton of repairs from a recent storm, so I can understand how something minor like this got missed.  I also noticed after the fact that there is a scratch on the faux wood finish on the door card, which wasn't there before. A little peeved by this, but life goes on.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

The owner helped cover my rental because of issues with the insurance claim with Allstate. Even one of the Service Advisors Mel came in on the weekend when they were closed to help me. This team goes above and beyond in every way and if you find yourself in need of a repair consider yourself lucky if these people are on your side. They will go up to bat for you and slam it out of the park. WELL DONE Caliber.< /Review></record>

Caliber Collision is fantastic to work with, and I highly recommend them. I had a major issue with the drains in my sunroof that left my car flooded. The work they had to do was labor intensive, and they kept me updated the entire way. I got my car back better than new, on time, and the work was excellent.<//review>

I've been going to Mike's Auto Repair & Body Center for a couple years now and they always take fantastic care of me and my car. They're great with communication and I can always count on them to call me to explain whats going on with my vehicle before starting any work so we are on the same page! They're work is always completed in a timely manner and with fantastic quality. I will continue to bring my car here for any body work/mechanical needs! :) Thanks!< /review>

This is easily the best repair center in the area. Not only were they the only ones open early in the morning on a weekend, but they were able to take my car (even with a full schedule) and get it back to me within a few hours. Extremely nice staff, great work. If you need anything done, this is the place.<//review>

Excellent service! Went in this morning without even calling because of two tires that would keep losing pressure. They took care of it right away. Checked both tires and turned out they both had nails. They got them fixed in less than 30 min. Fair price. Great customer care! Definitely a place to go back when I will need it. Thanks< /Text>

I got referred to this autobody shop by insurance company. My car was damaged substantially and I was really concerned and called them several times. After two weeks my car looks like brand new. Special thanks to Armani for patience and for answering my calls and questions. Last, their update message "Your Nissan is all fixed and ready to come home!" made my heart melting.<//Text>

The customer service here was absolutely amazing. As somebody who works in the service industry I never expected such great service from a motor mechanic/collision repair shop. Beyond how nice everybody was the work on my car was done quickly and right. My car looks better than it did before I was hit and took less than a week for the repairs. I would highly recommend this place</Text>

<user_name>Dorothy Taylor<//user_name><Review>When dealing with something as stressful as unexpected car body repairs, it's a relief to have a shop with friendly, trustworthy people to help out. I can't speak highly enough about Armani and his quick attention to my issue after my car was hit recently. He was easy to work with, helped alleviate my stress, and got my car in driving condition again.</Review></record>

< review>
This review is based on the associate named Edgar. Edgar was able to identify a bent in my lift gate that I myself couldn't have seen. Dropped off my car on a Wednesday picked it up on a Saturday. I suggest that you request a order the parts and then you come back to leave your car if that's an option for you. When I received my vehicle it was washed and what to appeared waxed, my rims looked as if they've been polished at a dealer ship. If you need a vehicle here's a handy tip, there's an enterprise located in the same building. I recommend you get a reservation before arriving.<//review>

<review>First, you have to give a bad review and then, you get the free estimate. Response is fast.
I am happy I got the free estimate.
Here my 1st review.
Free estimate is false advertising.
After I submitted my pictures, because I was promised will get a "free estimate", I received nothing but a "call me back..."<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1533743304456, 'text': "Sorry for the misunderstanding.

Nice little 2-part park.  One end is a lush grassy area with bathrooms, basketball court and workout stations.  Other end is a little grassy area with lots of picnic ops and bathroom.  In between is either a walk along a busy road or a walk along the creek with lots of garbage, dog poop and discarded clothes.  Weird but I felt safe.  Some access to a little creek that's pretty stagnant in summer, but access areas are shady and trashed.< /Review>

<Text>A nice park next to an upscale neighborhood.   The bathrooms are functional and supplied with public supplies.   Homeless folk attend this nice park to rest and park vehicles for the day.   Playground and surrounding landscape are nice.   Many squirrels so watch left out food during picnics.  Parking is abundant.< /Text>< pictures>

Alignment and oil change. My service attendant was polite, explained what was needed to be completed and what I was going to need on my next appointment. Checked me in quickly and checked me out quickly. Mike Bennet was very efficient and polite.....great experience 👍<//Review>

The folks at Mossy Nissan of Escondido were the "Nicest" most professional people I have ever delt with in my many years living in San Diego County and Riverside County. Especially "Cheyenne" and "Anthony"who was so Great and helped me through the whole process, she is definitely a One of a Kind Top Salesperson. I will definitely recommend all my Family and Friends to go to Mossy Nissan of Escondido.

Most unprofessional dealership! They harass you with calls to get you in. Once you are there to discuss purchasing a vehicle none of the sales representatives know anything about the vehicle and packages being offered by nissan. They try to push vehicles on lot vs. listening to what the customer wants. I had to repeat myself numerous times,  in the end clearly spelling out I want a factory order since they didn't present any valid options.  They insisted I put $1k deposit on the spot without actually walking me through the order. They were in a rush to close after wasting 3hrs of my time showing me cars I had no interest in, and assured me sales representatives will call tomorrow to place order.  4 days later no call. When I call the dealership to speak to sales representatives, I just get his voicemail with no return call. They took my money and delivered nothing in return.  Stay away from this dealership,  they clearly don't care about customers nor know how to operate professionally.<//Review>

After getting a simple oil change I guess they are too busy to turn off a sensor sign which made me have to pull over my car and actually check under the hood to see if they actually did an oil change. Don't get fooled by reviews where friends will give a biased review trying to hook there friend or family's company. Plus they did damage to my vehicle's interior when they did an inspection (scratches on the interior upper glove box). They never smile in service and if they do it looks forced or fake.< /Review>

As for buying a Nissan, sadly I cannot recommend them anymore.  We have always had Nissans, dating back to my original '72 240Z.  But with the CVT issues from the the 2009 era, and how Nissan handled it,  I am no longer looking to own a new one.</text>< GmapID>

<text>Bijon was extremely helpful and knowledgeable when it came to finding me the perfect car in my price range. He explained every single little detail about the car I was interested in and answered all of my questions thoroughly. The GM, Ron, was great and helped to ensure the rest of the process went smoothly. They basically rolled out the red carpet for us, even put on one of my son’s favorite movies so he didn’t get bored. The entire experience was excellent and we will be back!< /text>< Pics>

Problem didn't get fixed. Went for a stuck seatbelt, then of course it works when I arrive. So nothing they could do if I wanted to go off the warranty. I'll be back when it stops working again. Service guy was super cool and explained what I should do.</text>

Warning: stay away from Ramiz. Sticking to their poor reputation, went in to lease a 2021 Leaf and were shown a made-up payment breakdown showing total lease payments (including taxes) would be  110% of the original advertised lease. At that point we realized we were being scammed. Only wish we would have taken a picture to submit it to the Department of Consumer Affairs. Mossy Nissan again does not fail to disappoint having experienced a similar poor experience a few years back. We should have stuck to our promise of never again attempt to buy a vehicle from a Mossy Nissan dealership..</review>

<Text>Bought a car here 5 years ago been really happy with the Rogue & our salesman. Dijon. But today I needed tires so called service dept. Mike told me got a deal today. Buy 1 get one for $1. I cancelled my appointment at Costco and bought them at the dealership. However when I got my bill it seemed high. Upon further review I got 1 tire for a buck not two. I confronted Mike and he said I misunderstood him - It was buy 3 get one for $1. Not a lot of money to lose it's just the fact that they lie right to your face. I don't trust these guys and you should watch them. They are super tricky. I've got a call into the GM - I hope he returns my call we'll see. Watch out for these guys.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dbf4ed09a2042d:0x221014e2f3e11198< /gmap_id></record>

<review>The sales was handled all by phone and home delivery.  My sales person Ceasar Prado was very professional and well informed about the car I was looking for.  Mr. Prado has also offered great follow up information that I forgot to ask at the time of delivery about my new Nissan Versa SV.  I am a very satified customer.< /review>< pictures>

I took my 2019 Frontier pro 4x on a Saturday and was met by Travis the service advisor whom is very knowledgeable about Nissans in particular, Xterras and Frontiers. He told me some cool features about my truck that I did not know. Bernardo Lopez is the tech who worked on my truck and he was also extremely helpful and nice.< /Review>

My first experience there was awesome was able to make a great deal that led to four (4) purchases. My recent visit was heartbreaking, after making 4 purchases from this dealership they treated us without any value or consideration of our support and the business we provided. Definitely not going to recommend anymore.< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>Never go to this place. I stopped going there because they tried to rip me off. Took my car there and my car started experiencing shaking. Took my car back to them and then they told me after “inspection” my car has 2 damaged rims and that’s what’s causing the shaking. For some reason when the sales representative was telling me all that, the guy working at parts had a smile on his face and told me “you never see these things coming”. I wasn’t convinced and took my car to a shop outside and they told me there was no damage at all. I then went to a different Nissan location and did a tire rotation and my car was still perfect. Avoid this place.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Received a very dismissive treatment from the "sales manager". Went back there because the second key I received for the van I purchased with them a week earlier did not open the doors nor start the car. Unfortunately for me the nice car salesman who helped me the day of my purchase was not around. It seems that everyone I came in contact with that day did not want to be bothered.< /Text>< pics>

<text>Had taken my car for service at another mechanic did not know where Nissan service was available. Michael my service person was great and he took care of my service needs like a champ. I was insure as I was leaving my vehicle at the service the night before but everything ran like clock work. He emailed me as the service was going along and I felt like he was really working hard to have my service needs met. He was every bit as nice when I went to gt my vehicle. I will definitely take my vehicle to Mossy Nissan from here on in.

Akim in sales was excellent in how he treated my Mom with the Lease of her new Rogue.  This transaction was weeks in the making, and he touched base with her routinely, but in a helpful manner, not a pushy salesman style.  He understood the financial situation, and her wishes for what she wanted in the car.  Ron (manager) oversaw the transaction & was very friendly & engaging.  In the end, she signed her docs with Jason in finance, who was also very professional yet personable.  Truly a great crew, and it was a positive experience doing business with Mossy Nissan in Escondido!<//review>

Albert was really attentive and answered all my questions. He was very polite and helpful. Once my car was ready, he surprised me with a car wash. I didn’t expect it and was very nice of him. My car was pretty dusty and Albert went ahead and gave it a wash! I felt very happy, pleased and thankful. I definitely recommend Albert!!<//review>

Brought my 2017 leaf in to have the battery checked, I drive 35 miles to work each way, and the battery is half gone by the time i get to work, there's definitely something wrong with it,  and thats going 60-65 mph on highway, but they said oh the battery is fine can't warranty range drop, Im really disappointed buying that car, its costing me more money than driving a regular car<//Review>

Both Cesar and Angel went above and beyond for me in getting the perfect car. They were so patient amd helpful making it a great experience. I thank you you both! I literally didn't use one of your other dealerships because I felt more comfortable and happier with Angel and Cesar's excellent customer service! The easiest time I have ever had at a dealership, ever!< /review>

< review>
Fluid ran out 2 days after and no inspection result check list or document.
The service rep was nice and efficient.  The wait area was clean and good.
After the service I got receipt and list of services requested but no paperwork on what was actually done or results.  Example no measure of tire treads or brake pads condition or battery test results or check list of fluids ok.  Most service centers have this.  I did not get this but fine I just had to assume and trust it done when they said all good.  However 2 days later I went to use washer fluid and it ran out.  That makes me think inspections were not done or thorough.  If washer fluid is not part of check then it should be as most other service centers.  If it is part of check then the inspection was not done.
Now I have a dirty windshield until I got and get washer fluid myself.  But worse I have to worry about what else might go wrong.< /review>

I was told the diagnostic fee of $150 would be applied to my repairs, but that was a lie.  Because I had asked to have brakes and rotors replaced, they claimed the diagnostic fee was to torque everything to spec. Also, you were out of a part and I ended up making the trip to Hemet to get it rather than wait a day or so and I was charged $15 for "installing" a caliper bolt which should've been part of the brake job.  I was over charged and misinformed.  The only reason I paid it was because I wanted my car back. I will never recommend or use Mossy Nissan in the future.  The service advisor was professional, however did not stick with what he said about applying the diagnostic fee towards the repair.<//Review>< Pics>

Cesar is the best! Car shopping is one of my lease favorite tasks since I‘m put in a situation where I feel pressured to buy before I’m ready. Cesar not only respected my timeline, listened to my needs and got me set up with exactly what I was looking for that also fit my budget. He made me feel comfortable and I’m really happy with my new car. :)< /Text>

I can’t say enough great things about working with Akim at Missy Nissan in Escondido. I have had previous bad experiences at other dealerships, but Akim has made it so easy, as well as not pressuring me into something I didn’t want. He and his team were able to work with me and get me the best price possible. If you want a great experience, and somewhere you can trust that they will be take care of you, go and see Akim as Mossy Nissan Escondido!!< /text>

<Text>I purchased my car on Saturday.  Thank God my son-in-law was there to help me because I would have walked out hours earlier.  I can't stand all this negotiating stuff.  My patience is gone at my stage of life.  Sorry!  The Sales man was very nice but everything always takes too long, and the weather was about 100 degrees.  Not good for selling cars to little-old-ladies.<//Text>< pics>

I was unable to use the Mossy shuttle services due to COVID. However one of the workers was able to connect me with their Uber as my new number was locked in some one else's account. Thank you for all the service!!!!< /text>

You couldn't even log my mileage correctly.  My car currently has 57499 and on the tag you put 55,900 or 9/04/20.  On my paperwork you had my car at like 52K.  Logging the mileage is on of the easiest things to do so my faith in your service techs is pretty low.</Text>

We had a transmission that had to be replaced. We were unhappy that Nissan would not honor an extended warranty that was bought by the original owner. Our car has under 22,000 miles on it but we didn't know that the original warranty ran out 6 weeks ago. We were given many different answers by your warranty department which caused a lot of problems for the wife of the deceased original owner and ourselves. On a gently driven car a transmission should last longer than that mileage. In fact I realized that a slight sound I had heard since buying the car was part of the transmission problem. So I will never purchase another Nissan.
The only good thing was the service we received from Javier in the service department. He was extremely professional and did his very best to help us with the warranty fiasco. So because of him we would return to Nissan for service. He did a great job.<//Text>

<Review>After purchasing our new Pathfinder my wife and I felt it was the best car buying experience we could remember.  Bijan Yari our sales consultant was absolutely the best.  He wasn't pushy and went over ever aspect of the purchase to our satisfaction.  Furth more Bijan showed us all of the features on our new car and reviewed with us how they worked.  Because of Bijan our car buying experience was absolutely flawless and will certainly recommend him to anyone we know who is looking to purchase a new car.< /Review><date>1602689088845< /date><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

Akim was great! He worked with me to get the car I truly wanted, and helped me get it at the payments and deposit I needed. He worked very hard to go above and beyond to help me in my situation! I have bought a car from a small local dealership, only to have a very bad experience. I was very hesitant to buy a newer car, due to the issues from other dealers, and Akim was super helpful in showing me everything from title status papers, to Carfax papers. I will definitely refer more people to Mossy Nissan of Escondido! Keep up the good work!</review>

My service guy is friendly and professional.  Mossy doesn't try to upsell you on services that aren't needed for your vehicle. This is my second vehicle that I purchased through Mossy and I love their sales and service department. Definitely will continue to bring my vehicle here for its regular maintenance services.< /Review>

Sales personnel were very nice and knew the product details.  Agreement on purchase easily reached.  Only shortfall was the thoroughness of covering all the features of the car; however, in their defense I was in a bit of a hurry to get back home and they probably knew that.  Elsewise, I was very pleased with the dealership.</text>

I was with my 3 children and got a flat tire in Escondido  , they refuse to fix it and ask me to buy a new tire because they care about "my safety " I refused to buy tires from them because they overcharge in every service  then I drove to Discount tire they fix it for free.
in another incident  they   asked for additional $ 20  to rotate tires while servicing my brakes  and tires already removed.
in another visit while changing oil I asked Travis  to install a headlight bulb that purchased myself from amazon for $ 8 he asked me to pay $75  after I watched a YouTube video I install it my self  in 20 seconds with no tools. first do not buy a Nissan or if you badly want one get it from somewhere else .< /Review>< Pictures>

I'm changing my review because I had originally gotten my car in Feb 2017. Well, a few months later the molding from the windshield came out. I went back to Nissan to have them fix it. They didn't.  They only tucked it into the clip on the front so I wouldn't notice. It's been two years now and they still never fixed it. I went to Mossy Nissan in El Cajon and to get it fixed now would cost $200 or so. Had they fixed it right the first time, it would have been covered under my warranty but they screwed me over. Don't go here. They will trick you into paying a higher price than listed and will give you a botched vehicle.< /text>

The finance guy did a credit check on me even though I was paying in full in cash that day. I called to ask about my registration paperwork and just hung up on me. I had to call DMV to fix it myself. They also need to do better with checking their "certified pre-owned" cars, mine had a older model back hatch, but no record of any repair, so I guess the inspection is not THAT thorough...Would never return to this dealer, ever.< /text>

We sometimes fall short and I thank you for bringing these to our attention. I'm happy to look into your situation personally, but am unable to identify you based on the profile you used here. We do ask permission prior to pulling any credit, so I'm happy to research why this was asked. Some DMV issues are not able to be done by us due to privacy and DMV policy. It's absolutely not our policy or practice to hang up on someone. Again, I'm happy to look into your situation and see what happened. As far as the certification goes, there is a Nissan checklist that comes with every CPO vehicle as well as a third party inspection, so that we can ensure all vehicles are reconditioned to 1st class standards. I'm unclear what the concern is of an older hatch, but would be happy to look unto your concern further to see if there is problem or concern that something was not done. I regret that you did not receive our best and am happy to look into each and every concern.

My service guy really went out of his way to wash my car because that's the extra perk I really liked. He was very honest with all the services I thought I needed. He let me know I already had certain services completed months before.

My service writer Travis, is very pleasant and knowledgeable. We finally determined it was a gasket within my gas cap that was causing my ‘need to service engine soon’ light to repeatedly turn on. I’m so pleased the issue has been resolved.</Review>

My service writer was Manny Rios. Manny is an excellent employee and I hope he is my service writer every time I come in. He was courteous, pointed out that there was a recall on my vehicle, got my service needs taken cared of, and called as soon as my vehicle was done. Excellent service by a very nice young man!< /review>

<Text>I helped my mother purchase her new Nissan Rogue Sport about 7 months ago at Mossy Nissan Escondido.  At the time of purchase, both my mother and I remember being told that we should bring the car in at 5000 miles for a complimentary oil change.  My mother and I are independently sure that this was said.  When I took the car in I was told there was no actual documentation of this offer and that the policy of doing this had long been out of practice.  While I do not question that this is true, I am absolutely sure about what was verbally promised to her.  I had a prolonged conversation with management and while I understand that they worked within policy to offer me a discount (final cost was almost $40) I totally disagree with that type of a business mentality.  I can guarantee that the cost to the reputation of Mossy Nissan is going to far exceed the $40 that I was asked to pay.  As customers we put trust in to the company we choose to do business with and either Mossy is unwilling to honor a small (even if mistaken) verbal commitment or they are unwilling to put trust in myself.  Either situation is unacceptable to me and indicates an unacceptable degree of inflexibility.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>{'time': 1592516394616, 'text': 'Robert,\nThank you for bringing this to our attention.

<Review>Took my car in for a routine oil change and tire rotation on a Monday. On Thursday, my car's radio wasn't working again.  Had the radio problem back in Feb 2020, had the radio replaced. Now a new radio is having same issues.  Just took the car back to the dealership today Friday, to fix. Hope they can figure it out once and for all.<//Review>< Response>

Better than Fix-It. Had my mom's Cadillac for weeks waiting on a part. Painted surfaces don't seem to have luster. A "second choice" placed. Haven't found a good body shop that's 1st rate,  so this isn't a bad choice. Not perfect.<//text>

Awesome place!!Took my Sentra in for an oil change and service technicians
discovered my CVT was bad and wasn't worried because Jesus told me that it was covered by warranty and that they would need it for a few days to fix. Not only was I relieved but was fixed up with a rental in the meantime, which was a relief so I wouldn't be without  transportation. It was repaired but had to return bc it needed adjustment and Mike took care of it that day. I'm always happy when I leave Mossy Escondido because I know they care alot about their customers and the staff is always leaving a great impression that reflects the Mossy name and Company. Thank you Mossy Escondido!!</review>

<Text>My father and I went your dealership with no intention of buying that day, we were just coming to look at the cars, pricing, and options available. Once we arrived at the dealership we were greeted by Saleperson William Elliot. He was very polite and asked us if we had any questions or needed help. My dad does not like strangers, but William made him feel at ease and within minutes my dad was telling him jokes and stories about his current car. Still with no intention of buying that day, we did test drive the Nissan Sentra and I really liked the car and decided to look at some numbers. We felt no pressure from William to buy anything and he was very helpful with all the questions we had which ultimately lead us to leasing the Sentra we test drove. William is a great salesperson - He went above and beyond by detailing the car himself, since it was so late in the evening.

I can't forget about Aaron Felker in your Finance Department. He was also very patient with us when we had questions regarding the contract, was quick to make corrections when we noticed an error, and he is currently being very patient and helping me with an issue with one of our other loan companies.

Overall we had an outstanding experience at Mossy Nissan and will definitely recommend your dealership and William Elliot to anyone we know who is looking to buy a car.</Text>< Pics>

Akim did a great job of showing and explaining the vehicles I was interested in; and listening to what my wants and needs were. The sales manager (I forgot his name, I think Roy?) found a great deal and really took care of me. Josh the Finance Manager walked me through the entire process and made me feel calm and secured through the entire process. I left the dealership with a new car, a fantastic experience, and the security of being taken care of and not screwed over. Good job to the entire team for making this the easiest, calmest, and most enjoyable car buying experience I've ever had.</text>

I apologize your repair did not go as well as we would all of liked. Backorder on new parts and rental coverage limitations from insurance companies can be frustrating and we should have offered additional guidance on how to address it. Based on notes, it appears there was a problem getting messages to you and we should have found an alternate was to contact you. The front plate was not attached (and missing) to the vehicle when we received it, but if you order new plates from the DMV, we will happily install them. I trust the repairs were done in the highest quality standards as that is what our collision center is known for.

Customer service lacked, I  didn't receive any messages that Mike said he left for me. I had to call and get updates continously.  Parts were on back order which caused a much longer wait time. My rental car coverage ended (after 30 days) and I  was without a car for a whole week. Which really hurt me professionally and forced me take public transportation spending money that I didn't have. Upon the last time calling I asked to speak with a manger to get information to see if a rental was available  (I have used the rental service during routine car care at the Kearny Mesa location). Mike was aware of my situation and never once offered the service to me. I will say each time I  spoke to Mike he was kind and informative. When I picked up my vehicle there was no gas, literally 17 miles before empty (positive I had gas prior to drop off). Also my front license plate was missing, gone. I thought repairing my car with the same company I purchased it from would be a breeze,  boy was I wrong. I most likely will not be returning to any location unless it is covered from the collision service received. Will go with my insurance suggestion in the future. Step it up!< /Text>

This is the 3rd time I didn’t receive a car wash, my oil change & tire rotation took nearly 2 hours and then it was recommended that I Change my cabin air filter.. which literally has just been done so I’m feeling some dishonesty there. I didn’t receive the multi inspection check sheet either so I can’t see what’s in the red, yellow or green.<//review>

<Response>{'time': 1590851933897, 'text': "Katinka,\nThank you for spending the time and writing about your service at our store. It's very helpful as we continually strive to improve our service and our client's experience. We have limited our services during the pandemic and discontinued the car was service for now. Thankfully, business has really picked up in the last few weeks and we have begun expanding our staff in order to serve people better and decrease wait times. I apologize you did not receive our best during this time, but we are hopeful to be back to full capacity and able to serve all of our clients at the highest level very soon. I will have your service advisor send you the recommendations and multi-point inspection. It should have been included together, but may have been missed. I did not find that we had replaced the in-cabin filter at you last visit in 2018, and we would have made that recommendation based on time and mileage (it’s not easily removed for inspection). Of course, once you inform us that it was recently done elsewhere, we would retract the recommendation. Regardless, please feel free to contact our team or me with any further questions about your service. We look forward to serving you in the future!\n\nBest,\nScott\n\nScott Kiefner\nGeneral Manager\nscottk@mossy.com"}< /Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Service Advisor - Javier Perez - I had $1700 worth of service performed on my car on August 1st at Mossy Nissan Escondido. My car was accidentally damaged during service, and I flipped out on the inside emotionally because I LOVE MY CAR! The service manager and Javier Perez quickly ordered a replacement part and fixed the damage in a timely manner. I was very happy with all the service work that was done to my car, and also them fixing the mistake. I think my only complaint is the general manager Scott not communicating with me. I tried to contact him and he ignored me. I've had all good experiences with Mossy Nissan of Escondido in the sales, financing and service department over the years. Thank You, Javier Perez, in the service department for all your help on this recent visit. I do appreciate it.<//text><Rate>5< /Rate><Resp>{'time': 1568381511701, 'text': "Thanks for taking time to write out your experience at our store and the shout out to Javier and the service team!

I was hesitant to take my car to this Mossy Nissan, only because I used to live in Poway & bought my previous car from that location, but this experience changed everything. From the get go, Mossy Nissan's Escondido team was responsive and accommodating with my sudden car emergency, and did everything they could to make sure me and my car were taken care of!

<Review>Came in for my 15,000 maintenance along with a coupon for changing my oil approximately $35.00 and my maintenance still cost me $227.48. I don't understand, why does my oil & filter change show $14.30, upgrade to synthetic oil $49.00, air filter replacement $41.38. I didn't expect to pay over $200.00 in maintenance, and I was also asked to come back after 21,000 miles, how much is that going to cost me? Granted this is a new car and I want to keep up with my maintenance as I have on my past vehicle (Honda). I bought Honda new and kept up with maintenance and never paid over $100.00 for maintenance. Thought I would share this experience. Thanks for listening.< /Review><date>1574215352316<//date><gmapID>0x80dbf4ed09a2042d:0x221014e2f3e11198<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I brought my 2015 Pathfinder in for an oil change and tire rotation.  Andre noticed an warning alert regarding my transmission.  On closer inspection it was discovered my transmission was in need of replacing.  Andre informed me I had still had coverage with my warranty but it was close to expiring.  He saved me over $4,000!  Thanks to Andre for his diligence and Nissan for living up to their good reputation.</Text>

< Review>
I had a great experience purchasing my Nissan Rogue. Akim was my sales consultant and he really took the time to listen to what was important in the vehicle I wanted. I have purchased a number of cars, but this has by far been the easiest process.</Review>

<review>My parents have bought two trucks in the past week with Nick the general sales manager and Cheyenne! They both made the car buying process so flawless and easy. No stress !! Cheyenne was a pleasure to deal with and Made the experience enjoyable. Nick D. Was amazing and really went above and beyond to get us the trucks we wanted and within our budget! We would highly recommend this dealership and Nick and Cheyenne for your car buying experience. We will be back to buy the next ones from them!

I made an appt with & looked at the available Nissan Altimas.  I didn't think I'd find one with a sun roof, but then it happened.  Then, the financial part was the drawback.  The salesman and manager worked with us & I got to drive home in a new Altima!</Text>

Mossy ruined my credit and wrote me a bad contract.  They pulled my credit 20 times, couldn't make the deal work, and they are giving me the running around saying it "shouldn't"affect your credit. No one is taking any responsibility for abuse to my credit.  They didn't reach out to me with options they were finding of higher rates, they couldn't get the rate they contracted with me in store.  Finally they tried to  double the interest rate but wouldn't come down on the vehicle price to make the deal work.  They don't care about honoring contracts or keeping their promises.</Text>

Had a great experience buying my 2018 Rogue. Ryan Frank was awesome. He took the time to make sure I got the car I wanted. The process was painless. I would highly recommend Ryan and Missy Nissan Escondido.<//Review>

This place is a joke. No wonder why there are so many negative reviews. The service manager is an old creep who doesn't honor warranties. Be careful of this dealership!< /review>

I will only take my vehicle to Mossy Nissan in Oceanside.  I have had the same service advisor Carlos Lona, since I bought my XTerra and even though he doesn’t directly handle clients any longer....he always makes the time to help me.  The service there is the best I have ever had and that’s the reason I continue to come back....even though I moved about 40 minutes away.  Carlos Lona always calls when he says he will and that is a pet peeve of mine. Good communication is key.  Also he keeps track of my warranty work and my mileage maintenance like oil changes and tune ups.  I’d forget otherwise.  I’d buy my next vehicle at Mossy
( I wish Nissan still made XTerras as we love ours! ) and I’d highly recommend their service department and specifically Carlos Lona to anyone.<//text>

<Review>Pricing could be better. We bought in Oceanside. They said they would match prices but on the day we were going to purchase they backed out. Too bad for them because my daughter ended up buying a Rogue that day too. Two cars at same time. I give them 3 stars because they were polite and courteous but unable to work a deal. Hope sales manager reads review that he lost 2 because he just couldn't negotiate with us.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Very expensive and misleading service department:
I took my Nissan pathfinder a week ago, Service adviser told me my vehicle need transmission need oil change. I asked how much will it cost? He told me $310.00. He also told me that no one else can do it due to complexity. I took my vehicle to a mechanic on university Ave, I paid $150.00 for the same service syntactic CVT transmission oil included in the price.
Few month ago my Pathfinder's washer tank was leaking. I took it to the same Nissan's service department. They told me it will cost over $100.00 to find where the problem is plus part and labor. He told me the leak is caused by rats chewing the hoses.
I took my vehicle to the same repair shop on University Ave and paid 15.00 that include part and labor. I decided not to take any car to any dealerships for service.< /text>

Excellent service! I went into to get a simple oil change without an appointment and my service advisor advised me that there was a recall item on my vehicle and needed to be tended to. He was really helpful by giving me a courtesy vehicle and provided excellent service while my truck was in the shop. The advisor kept me informed on the status and checked up on me few days after the fix was completed. Good job Mossy Nissan!<//Text>

I recently had my vehicle serviced at Mossy Nissan and had the pleasure of working with Ron Garner, Service Advisor. I found Ron, who I met today for the first time, very courteous, knowledgeable, and eager to address my service needs. Ron provided great customer service and it was a wonderful pleasure to work with him! Thanks Ron for the first class customer service!!!

<Text>Very disappointing. They ran a test on my car that doesn't even work for the type of car I have. Then fixed something on my car that didn't need to be fixed and gave me my car back with still a clear problem. I brought my car in the next weekend at 8:15 a.m. to get the actual problem fixed and they were unresponsive and rude. They waited until 2:30 to tell me the real problem with my car and were more than willing to charge me yet another arm and a leg for a problem they should have fixed the first time.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< user_name>

Akim Akimi is stellar and professional.  He and the staff of Mossy Nissan Escondido were nothing less than exceptional.  I've purchased three vehicles from Mossy Nissan in San Diego County from 2 different Mossy dealerships, but the service at Mossy Nissan of Escondido was by far the best. The signing process was easy and we were out of there in no time.< /Text>

A trillion times BETTER than Pacific Beach Nissan!!! PB Nissan stole 10's of thousands of dollars from a combat military nurse whom ALWAYZ took her vehicle there for service and never asked questions but simply paid for whatever they recommended or said they replaced/repaired. That is until I had to take it in for an oil change and I took it to my Indy. Not only had her tune-up NOT been done but when I questioned PB Nissan (POA) they refused to answer my questions. Long story short, ANY MILITARY PLEASE SEE CARLOS IN OCEANSIDE AT MOSSY OR GO TO ESCONDIDO NISSAN, I had to contact Nissan of North America and they refunded her money and completed every "supposed" invoice that was presented. I was treated with respect and welcome at Esco Nissan, me and my 7 yr old!!!</review>

Both David Mendoza and Will Elliott were absolute dolls in making my car-buying experience a real pleasure. Not only did I get a gorgeous car, I got a screaming deal. If you want to have a wonderful experience, no high pressure selling and a feeling of good-will, you need go no further than Mossy Nissan in Escondido.</Text>

< review>
Akim Akimi was very friendly, patient and was willing to help us out. We had a very complicated situation with our current (at the time) 2013 sentra, which I recommend you stay away from those models. Their cvt transmission is horrible and not reliable. Anyways we had two cars to trade in and the broken down sentra was obviously negative equity. Therefore we had a complicated situation with not many options. When we first walked in, an older gentleman was helping us out which I don’t remember his name but he didn’t seem to have much patience and didn’t seem so interested in helping us out and his “solutions” seemed so unreal to say the least. He was at some point letting us leave the dealership with almost no solution. It seemed like he didn’t want to work hard because our car situation required a lot of sitting down and playing around with Numbers. Right when we were about to go walk off Akim came out and very politely asked to give him a chance to see if he can do something for us. And guess what he did!!! We explained the situation to him and he also knew that it wasn’t an easy sale to take on but he had the patience and time to sit down with us till 11pm and he made it happen. He worked with us to keep our payments the same with a minimum down payment and getting our sentra towed from our house to the dealership. Very pleased that we got the opportunity to work with him and very happy with the outcome. Thanks Akim, by the way this sale happened back in July but with our busy schedules I just got around to writing it. If you’re looking for a car and you need some help don’t waste your time with other salesmen, go straight for Akim if he’s still working there.</review>

<Text>Transparency, Integrity and Best Price!
This is what you get in abundance at Mossy Sales Escondido . The Sales Manager David Mendoza sent me price and spec quotes of the car I wanted before I arrived! I saved so much money and time here.  Thanks to David Mendoza Internet Sales Manager and partner Ryan Frank for a very enjoyable experience. Also, the Finance Manager prepared several options to choose from as I do not have tier 1 credit, and he made it all affordable!  I got a personal follow up the next day from
Nick Dubiel General Sales Manager Mossy Nissan Escondido ensuring my total satisfaction.   Nice!

Great experience with a great sales rep. Akim Akimi made us feel comfortable and happy. He was knowledgeable about his cars, especially the Z. It was an amazing experience and will come back for another.< /Text>

I just wanted to say Thank You to the service advisor Ron.  He brought my car up for me after an oil change and notice a loud popping when I opened my driver's door.  He took my car back and tighten the bolt and NO MORE popping!  It has done that since I bought the car.  No one else took the time to fix it until Ron.  THANK YOU!  I really appreciate you taking the time to give great customer service!< /text>

I went to Oceanside Nissan and they were not helping with price or the type of car I had my heart set on. I heard nothing but great reviews on Mossy Nissan in Escondido so I took a chance the following day. I went there and I was unable to get what I wanted to due to my budget but the found me something similar in size wise with EXCELLENT features. I walked out with a 2018 Rogue midnight edition and I couldn’t be happier! I’m so in love. Thank you Will Elliot for explaining everything and making me a customer for life!</Text>

<review>Mossy Nissan of Escondido is a great dealership with professional dealers that genuinely do their best to find you the best car. I went in as a first time buyer who was super nervous and had no clue what to do but Josh Lim made the whole experience of test driving cars to buying a car easy. If you are going in to test drive cars and/or buy one, I recommend that you request Josh Lim to help you through the process! By the way, test drive the Rogue Sport, it is awesome !</review>< pictures>

I’m going to make this short n sweet because that’s how my experience here was. It was a great place to do business at. The staff there r very friendly, very professional, super knowledgeable and patient. They have a great selection of vehicles and colors. The place was clean including the restroom thank goodness. Kudos to Nick Dubiel and his team at Mossy Nissan Escondido. Can’t thank them enough. If u r ever in the area and looking for a car I would definitely stop here<//text>

Unfortunate circumstances brought me into Nissan for a new car. Caesar and William did their absolute best to meet my needs and sell me the car that I wanted at the best price possible. Will definitely be taking my business here in the future and my boyfriend will be coming back in the next couple of months.<//Review>

<review>I would like to give the biggest shoutout to Josh Lim, the sales consultant who sold us our new car. Not once did we ever feel any pressure to actually buy a car, and Josh was completely patient and understanding to our indecisiveness and idiosyncrasies. He not only helped to find the perfect car that suited our family, but he went as far as pushing to find one in my specific color preference (yes...I’m not only indecisive but also picky), model, and more importantly for the right price that fit our family's budget. Working with him was like working with a good friend, or even a well liked family member. If you are in search of a new car, but have any anxiety about going to a dealership, I cannot recommend Josh enough. Throughout the rainy day, he made the process as calm as it could possibly be, yet efficient enough that our 4 year old was never bored with the process. Yes, we brought our 4 year old to the car dealership, and Nissan made the whole process so smooth that we did not have one outburst. In fact it was even entertaining for the child. THAT is how awesome the experience was.

I would also like to give a very special Thank You to Sergio who greeted our family outside in the rain when we first arrived, and who even drove me to my appointment (and got me there on time) while my husband wrapped up the paperwork with Aaron, who was also patient and wonderful.

It felt like the people we worked with truly cared about our needs and our well being, and I recommend this dealership if you are in search of a new/used vehicle. Thanks, guys!< /review><rating>5</rating>< Date>

Mossy is an awesome dealership and Nick Dubiel is the guy to see there. I bought my first truck form him many years ago and just recently sent my niece to him when she was looking for a new car. He's who I trust to take care of family.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><Review>Recently bought a new vehicle at Mossy Escondido.  The staff was helpful as would be expected for a car dealership, however, the buying experience ended up actually being quite laid back and pleasant, and the deal that I ended up getting was more than I expected.  It was clear they were motivated to not only sell a vehicle but get a long term customer, which I appreciated.

When I took the car back for a minor recall notice, the staff was courteous, very helpful and quite transparent.  I was told up front that it wouldn't be possible to get the vehicle done that day due to part availability and so they made sure I got a an UPGRADED rental vehicle as they felt bad about sending me off in one of their fleet rentals, after purchasing a more expensive vehicle.

Overall, I had a very positive experience, and would recommend this particular dealership to others.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dbf4ed09a2042d:0x221014e2f3e11198< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Excellent service.
David.M and Will were amazing.
We traded in our frontier for a brand new Titan.
We're a long time mossy customers and after dealing with 4 other mossy Nissans Escondido was by far the best of the best .

HORRIBLE experience, they wasted my time and money ! Went to get a leak fixed on my car which they tried to fix twice, on third complaint about the "fixed leak" they wanted me to pay for a body shop to fix it. After arguing logic they gave me a refund for half the money I paid. To add insult to injury that issued me a check set to arrive in the mail in 7 to 10 business days, well that was on 03/04/19 today is 03/18/19. And still no check. I called Mossy of Esco. and apparently they barely sent it out today and wait another 7 to 10 business days !
I will never do business with them again ! Ever !!!<//review>

<text>Extremely disappointed with the lack of customer service I received by the weekend manager by the name of Aaron.  I came in on a Sunday, my car which I purchased at this location a year ago; began to make a horrible noise and started stalling. I did not feel safe driving it and took it right in, as I drove in one of the sales men greeted me and made a comment on the noise of my car.

He explained to me the service department closed, but the weekend manager could possibly help.  I’ve been doing all car services at Mossy Nissan El Cajon and they were great.

Unfortunately I cannot say the same for Mossy Nissan Escondido; you would expect a manager to be respectful and courteous. To my surprise that was not the case, Aaron was completely disrespectful, and his tone was completely out of line. He said he couldn’t do anything for me and if I wanted I could go to another dealership for them look at my car!!!??

I was in shock; I purchased my car at this location it only has 36,000 miles and still under warranty and he was telling me to go elsewhere?!!! Seriously!! Should I add while he was speaking to me he never looked at me, he just stared at his monitor.

I truly regret purchasing a car from this dealership and most certainty will take my business elsewhere.</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>{'time': 1437064880847, 'text': 'Hi Miriam,\nWe appreciate your feedback and apologize for the inconvenience you experienced at Mossy Nissan Escondido.

They didn't offer to repair or nothing. I was given poor customer service since the beginning when I walked in. My family all own Nissan. I have had nothing but bad experiences since i purchase my vehicle in 2017. They only treat you right the first time when they try to get you to buy from them.  I came to Discount tire to have my tire checked and they only found a small nail that went in sideways and didnt affect my tire and they did the tire rotation with no problem.what a shame on Nissan who is supposed to give you the best quality service. I am never coming back to this location. I hope they learn to treat all their customers equally. I am a hispanic girl and noticed somewhat of a difference from other customers who were being serviced at that time. Makes me wonder.</text><userid>116335856749949097482< /userid>< Time>

I gave up on Nissan, was lied to by Oceanside more than once, and Pancho seemed to only want to fix things that he could charge me for.  Took my car to Oceanside multiple times for transmission, always left w/same transmission problem but hundreds of dollars less due to other things found.  Andre not only found problem and got it fixed, I was only w/o my car for 3 days as opposed to 7+ days w/Pancho.  Will NEVER return to Oceanside.< /review>

Everyone is helpful and knowledgeable about all the cars they have. I worked with a sales consultant named Bijan and he stuck with me through 4 color changes and 3 car switches, in the rain. The only pressure I felt here was on myself when making my final decision. The sales manager today, Nick, made sure I was able to adhere to the terms I wanted. He and Bijan listened closely and made sure to get what I wanted.
I have to add that the service at this location has always been top notch, which is a bonus comfort when buying a car. A+ Mossy.

This store definitely is all about making a good deal and helping those who need it. I came here for my first car and had little to no credit as I was working on building it and Nick and his team did an awesome job of working the banks to get me approved. I came in almost sure I would be turned away like I would at other dealerships but they welcomed me with a smile instead and worked their magic.</text>

This is one of the pushiest dealerships I've ever been to. Expect to receive at least one call, text, or email per day for a week or two if you express any interest in their cars.
I only ever received routine tasks at their service department, and they always finished them quickly. However, there's nobody to greet you when you pull up to the service department and inside everybody seems incredibly busy - it was always a difficult task to drop my car off for service.<//text>

<Review>Everytime I bring my car in to be serviced, the customer service and work done is above and behind!! I refuse to take my car anywhere else. Jesus Sanz has helped me majority of the time and has always been on top of providing exceptional service🤩 the entire time. He always follows through with keeping me updated and walking me through what work needs maintenance at the time as well as keeping informed what will need to be taken care of in future trips. I highly recommend coming here to this location in Escondido and asking for Jesus (and if he is not available, all the other advisers, Ron or Javier, provide excellent service as well) for any of your Nissan service needs! Thank you guys for taking care of my car maintenance and providing excellent customer service so its a lot less of a chore!! 😆😎<//Review><GmapID>0x80dbf4ed09a2042d:0x221014e2f3e11198< /GmapID>< username>

I just purchased a 2018 Nissan Rogue in July, it's a month later and has been to service twice now for the same issues. They have only offered me a rental once for free for 1 day otherwise it's $29 per day and I have to make sure I bring it back full, so it's not really a deal. I asked to speak to a manager but no e was available. The tech said he's never seen a new car brought in for the issues mine is having. I scream lemon law but no one cares.<//text>

Hi guys, i don’t do google review/s but this time this guy just DESERVE it. Shot out to Josh Lim who helped us decide with ease, straighforward, honest and to the point transaction towards a great deal. Not so often you come across a person like him on the field of sales. No sugarcoating, no patronizing, just solid details to come up with the best deal. We were handled with care and patience and understanding without compromising the integrity of salesmanship. We went home with our dream car with a smile on our faces. Thank you Josh. Thank you Nissan Escondido.</Review>

I had a WAY BETTER experience here in Mossy Nissan Escondido than their few other locations in San Diego. I had a leased 2014 Sentra that was over mileage limit by 34k+ and I tried working various deals with different dealerships to upgrade it. But ended up here as my last resort and Jesus Resendiz came in and saves the day. He promised me to work a deal that would make me happy and change my mind about my previous experiences with other Mossy dealerships and he was def right about it. If you're searching for a friendly and reliable Nissan dealership in San Diego, this is the place to come! They know how to take care of customers who are tired of "deal-making" salesmen.<//Text>

<Date>1524173893806< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>The Salesman (Luis) was a great salesman,  the issue here was the Sales Manager and The Finance department. I bought a brand new Nissal Altima, loved the car, tinted the windows and even installed a stereo system. Literally almost 2 weeks later, I get a letter that the rate given to me was too low, note that I had already signed all the paperwork. Long story short was that I had to return the car and they didn't even reimburse me back on the money I had already spent on the car. I ended with an older model car, not very happy about that. The main issue here is the way the management team handled all this. All of it was done so unprofessional and will NOT recommend anyone to buy a car here.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1524345413301, 'text': "Cesar,\nI apologize we were unable to obtain final approval on the Altima. We do our best to work with the bank, but sometimes they are unwilling to finalize after looking everything over. We were able to obtain an approval on an alternate vehicle, as you indicated, and it's our hope you will enjoy that vehicle. Please contact me if there are any further questions or concerns about your transaction. My sincere wishes for happiness with your new vehicle.\n\nBest,\nScott\n\nScott Kiefner\nGeneral Manager\nscottk@mossy.com"}<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Called and requested a call back from the service manager.  Never got a call back.  Didn't get everything they said I would and I paid close to $500 for service.   You would think that I would get great service with the amount I paid - unfortunately not and money wasted.</Review>

<review>Negative from the beginning, I am on a budget and wanted a car for under $10,000. I was literally laughed at by the sales manager. I was shamed because I would not budge on my budget. When I was leaving they said they had something. When I saw the car it was not even in the price range I asked. I was passed to different salesmen. I guess my money was not good enough for such a successful dealership.<//review><Response>{'time': 1488233223703, 'text': 'David and Daniela,\nThank you for taking the time to write about your experience. I appreciate your comments and will use them to improve our business. I’m sorry we did not have a vehicle for you this weekend. We typically trade in low mileage, late model, certified vehicles. Vehicles that pass our inspection process and can be sold in the budget range you have requested are some of the toughest to find and sell very quickly. We do, however take in trades daily, and are happy to let you know if we get one that meets your requirements. We enjoy a fun and jovial type of atmosphere at the dealership with lots of smiles and laughter, and it appears that it came across as laughing at your expense. This was not our intent. I’m sorry it came across that way, and I ask that you accept my apology. We will do better in striking the balance of fun and business. Please let me know if I can help you two in the future…I’ll work with you personally if you like. Regardless, I hope you find the perfect car that meets your needs!\n\nBest,\nScott Kiefner\nGeneral Manager\n760.746.5050 x50211\nscottk@mossy.com'}</Response>< gmapID>

Worked here for almost 3 years as a technician.  This is by far the worst dealership to work for.  I do not recommend working here, or for that matter servicing your Nissan here.  Unless you need a transmission covered under warranty, they are real good at that, ask Nissan Corp.<//Review>

I rate car buying right up there with going to the dentist.  I had gone to several places with zero results and tons of frustration.  That is when I met  Bill Madonia at Mossy.  Bill took the time to explain the deal even when I saw he was ridiculously busy.  I never felt pressured and had all my questions answered.  It turns out not all car experiences have to be bad.  I would give Bill Madiona 6 stars if I could and would definitely recommend to my friends or family!</review>

<Text>These guys were great!  My husband is in the car business and doesn't like to haggle bcause he already knows a good deal.  Without letting Mossy Escondido know this, they gave us the best deal available and were upfront and honest about everything. This, after having left Mossy El Cajon because they wouldn't even speak with us (not the salesman's fault, it was management.) Mossy Escondido showed us the car, the deal, and we were out with our amazing great car within an hour with the best deal available.  I have bragged on Mossy Escondido ever since!

CVT on my Nissan Juke 2015 gave out and if you look online there’s a settled lemon lawsuit against Nissan’s CVT but it doesn’t cover my vehicle although it should. Charge 500$ for something that is faulty from manufacturer. Wouldn’t recommend buying any car from Nissan equipped with a CVT.</text>

Service took longer than the advertised 30 minutes to perform my oil change, and never called me to let me know what was going on with a second vehicle I dropped of, but there lobby was decent and so we're there basic service pricing.</text>

All I can say is MAKE SURE YOU GET THEM ON RECORDING WHEN THEY SAY, "Oh, just get in here and we'll figure out something".
Well, my friend, Kimmy, who had previously applied for a new vehicle through Roland, a salesman at Escondido Nissan. She was approved as long as she brought in a down of $1,000--- on the pre-selected a standard 6-speed, Sentra she fell in love with,  with all the bells & whistles... She was just waiting for that $1,000 down mony. She was gonna drive for Uber or Lyft--- and not pay their ridiculous owner get rich scheme type of car payment/loan payment/your whole freaking check thing they got going with those type of companies....  Well, this past weekend, those people she dealt with there, at Escondido Nissan, Roland, Nick....those were the ones on Sat night I heard them tripping over whatever it took to get her in there, and hoping I was wrong, found out today that, sadly, they are just a bunch of "scamming car salesmen" types as I thought hearing them as they performed their 3-ring, Bibbidy-bibbbady-boo BS on the phone with her.
I SO thought Autosalespeople were (and had) truly moved away from this approach and I thought they had fallen out of the "Attack an Airhead" tactic mode they so professionally tried to do AT my little friend, WHO IS ANYTHING BUT AN AIRHEAD!  But once I heard she never even got the car we (me personally for at least 6 hours that day, but probably more) endured the holey song and dance over (you see, I've been there, done that and---- never again will I buy a new vehicle and, I now repair cars MYSELF---- because of this kind of IGNORANCE and LACK OF CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS!!!)
That night on the phone, I heard 3 of those guys tell her over the phone to go ahead and come on in with her money and she'd be leaving as promised, one way or another--- with HER car,  the one for which she applied and that they approved her, with the down payment of $1,000 (check, cash, credit, but PREFERABLY with a preprinted check--- even though they never said they wouldn't take a check like that--- not that she tried to use that anyway!
But, she told the 3x and on different phone calls to them she could only afford $1000 down and she made it very clear if it was still for the one she dicussed & applied for, AND IF IT WAS FOR SURE, as she was being dropped off! Yes. Yes. And Yes was their reply, and without her check stubs even!
Needless to say, Kimmy is now in a deep depression and very angry over this, in that she wasted so much time & effort for these stupidass, lying, clowns and I REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE BEYOND ALL THIS, PEOPLE!!!

I'm seriously beginning to wonder if maybe she should sue them for SEXUAL HARASSMENT (Gender),  DISCRIMINATION (b/c she's female and they assumed possibly, that, "girls don't know anything about cars, finance or anything outside the kitchen or bedroom?" Not sure which or all and IF), or RACIAL DISCRIMINATION or even BREACH OF CONTRACT as I am sure when she filled out her initial application, it was with a certain vehicle in mind--- then they changed up on her and took away all the perks and extras and uped yhe down, another agreement they made anf violated with her! Ridiculous! What makes them think they can still do that to people and does Nissan really know about this? I love Nissans (especially Z's). But, you better bring your SPEAR if you're going to be in this feeding frenzy! These boys should get a real job instead of doing one on my friend, Kimmy😞 Shame on you Escondido Nissan!  Your sales tactics are not only archiac but ILLEGAL.  Escondido Nissan--- don't be a sheep🐑. Dare to lead with honesty & innovation---  make the world a better place💗< /Text>

<Review>I never do google reviews but I wanted to share our experiences with you, so it won’t happen to anyone else. I have been in the market looking for a vehicle. I have been interested in grand caravan’s and town and country’s. I have seen several of them from different dealerships. I have played the whole song and dance (we will work with price)  many times within my shopping experience. I’ve been to DCH in Gardena DCH in Temecula and many others. I have Cargurus app to help with my search. I got an email from Cargurus of a vehicle I might like due to my searches. I see the vehicle on the website, it had no interior photos. I send an email and ask. I get a response right away. I thought “WOW, customer service is awesome!” A guy (won’t mention his name) calls me back we talk. Left it that I would speak to my husband about seeing vehicle in person since it is 45 minutes from our home and we are tired from driving all over the place looking at mini vans the day before. I received a few more calls after that asking if I was going finally I told him the truth “we are ify about going, my husband said vehicle is over our price range so we don’t want to waste anyone’s time” his response was, “don’t worry we will work with you on the numbers, I promise you will be happy and we will get this process done” so I was convinced. We left and headed out towards dealership. I received another phone call asking our location, I then told him 30 minutes from you. That’s when he hit me with, “I’m going to have my co worker help you out, he will meet you and have vehicle ready, what car are you in?” I had a gut feeling things were not going to work in our favor after he said that. But I didn’t listen and we kept going. I like to deal with the person I originally was working with. Time is very valuable to me, especially Sunday since it’s family time and we attend evening mass. We get to see the vehicle, test drive it. Then ask the guy that was assisting us that we need time to talk. When we called him over I told him I’d like to talk numbers. I told him over and over that I was happy with my bank and their loan options but yet I was still nicely pursued to get a credit check which upset me a lot but I kept my cool. It ended up being that I needed to use my bank (which I already knew that) the guy then said “give your bank this info so they can fund loan” I was like WAIT A MINUTE! I don’t even know the OTD price. So he walked away to get that price. I then told my husband that I felt weird about the whole thing. I have been to many many dealerships and my grand father owned his own car dealership and worked side by side with Kal worthington. I’ve never seen someone try to give you information and have you buy a vehicle without showing you the price first! I knew he was trying to hide something. Well when he came back, OTD PRICE was sticker price plus taxes and fees!!! I made it clear over the phone that we were not thrilled about price and I was told that the numbers could be worked out in our favor and was promised that I’d leave happy. I assumed that it was an honest statement, the fact that this is Mossy Nissan and they seem to have a great reputation. I was even told that “  we have sold plenty of cars this holiday weekend and if there’s any time where we can make a deal with you on price it would be this weekend we would be able to work the numbers for you in your favor and you will leave happy with the vehicle I promise “  so when I seen the numbers that were not worked in our favor I said “oh no that’s way to high” guy looked at me and said ok... have a great day and we shook hands. He didn’t even try to ask what number amount I was thinking... didn’t even bother... his attitude  came out when I showed him the same vehicle for sale at another dealership for $1,500 less and with less miles. Again he let us walk. No apology for wasting our time and for the lie we were told. So now we are still without a vehicle, my credit score is most likely lower now due to  unnecessary credit check... we missed Sunday mass... and all for nothing. Unhappy!</Review>< time>

<Review>We bought a Nissan Versa Note SL from the dealership in Escondido and Chris went out of his way to find the exact color and model we wanted. We later had the sealant and window stencil done by the service department and they were great they gave us a nice rental to use so we could go shopping at North County Fair while the service was being performed.
Eric was great getting our paperwork ready for us and took a lot of time explaining everything to us in detail.

We were very satisfied with the sales, service and office staff.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1417809005528, 'text': 'Larry,  thank you for sharing your experience at Mossy Nissan Escondido.

<review>Im very unhappy, dissapointed, and unsatisfied with the customer service the sales manager JORGE ZUAZO gave to us yesterday. We were looking forward to buy a 2015 nissan pathfinder sv for $24,995 at first some guy told me they mispriced the suv but ended up giving me the price as i argue that was their fault for bad advertisement. We went inside to talk about numbers to continue with the negotiations with the seller angel. Everything look like an awesome deal until they came up with the apr of 8.22% from nissan. My mom has fair credit about 650 to 700 credit score and we told the seller that was a high Apr for the credit that she has. We asked the sales manager jorge for other banks and he told us nissan was the only one who accepted us. Doing my own math i figured they wanted to solve the mistake of the mispriced suv by offering us the highest apr. When i asked him to give me a print sheet with the info from the bank that was giving us the apr he refused to give it to me and basically told me "if you dont like the apr we dont deal and thats it" he took the papers and left. Me and my fam were shocked by his rude, poor  and unprofessional customer service. We didnt make the deal and left the dealership very dissapointed and pissed off with this guy. Idk how he can be in that position by treating customers the way he treated us.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1456864738061, 'text': 'Hi Hector, we appreciate your feedback and apologize for any inconvenience you experienced at Mossy Nissan Escondido.

Where do I begin?  I'll walk through the entire experience.

A few months ago, I met Chris Chrostowski (Sales Consultant) when I was helping my friend purchase pre-owned vehicle from their lot.  After a great experience, I told Chris that when I was ready to buy a car, I'd return to his dealership and work with by name.  Before making my way to dealership, I decided to appraise my vehicle via the Nissan website (fairly straightforward, very easy to use).  Once done with that, I received an email from Zack Bilbrey, (Internet Sales Manager) informing me of some purchasing options, and assuring me that I would be able to work with Chris.  Once I get to the dealership, both Chris and Zack greet me and reassure that a favorable deal will get done.  Midway through the process, I am introduced to Nick Dubiel (General Sales Manager). In accordance with the others, Nick made sure that I was able to get a good deal with low interest and reasonable payments.  He was friendly, attentive, and was committed to go out of his way to accommodate.  Lastly there was Eric ZuWalick, the Finance Manager.  Probably the most reassuring things about Eric was the fact that he was clear in his communication with me and he made me completely aware of all extended protection options that were available to me.  He took his time explaining everything to me and answered all of my questions.

I understand this a bit of a lengthy read, but these 4 completely deserve it.  I expect this kind of service from an individual when I make significant purchases like this, but to see everyone try so hard for me and for them all to be on the same page like that is truly unique.  I felt like I've known them all for years.  With that said, whatever you guys are doing over at Mossy Nissan Escondido, keep it up!  I've been apart of a few car purchases, but none of them stack to up to this experience.

Again, thank you (a lot!)

Sincerely,
Proud New Nissan Maxima Owner< /review>

I' m very disappointed, unhappy, and unsatisfied with Nissan at Escondido. I made a mistake to purchace a car at this dealership. Danny Costido was the one that helped me, he's a good actor and pretended to be so nice,,  but he lied on the price of the car. Jason was the other person that did the estimates and a believe he's a manager, those two shouldn't be working there. They were  suppose to charge me a little over 15,000 thousand, and they end up charging me over 16,000. They were suppost to give a 2,000 rebate discount and only gave me 500. They also ony gave me 1,500 hundred for my ford 2002 explorer sports trac. It's sad that they take advantage of women. I don't recomend Nissan of Escondido, they lie all the time and take advantage in every way,, too bad i couldn't return the car, i don't want to deal with this place never again. That is not a professional, good, or honest way to earn money.  No stars for Nissan of Escondido, i will tell all my clients never to go to this dealership.<//Review>

<Text>I would like to do two different reviews.  One for service  and one for the sales side which I would give a lot higher rating to.  Probably 4, maybe 5 stars.  Sales team is great.  Service leaves something to be desired.  I thought I couldn't get the service manager, Mark, to return my calls.  Or really just even respond to respond to his team.  (If they are in fact giving him the messages).  I learned now the first person I had been working with and left several messages with is now no longer working there.  (I may not have been the only one with this problem) When I bought my car 6 weeks ago, there was a minor fix that it needed.  Everyone in sales agreed it would be under warranty and EVEN IF the warranty didn't cover it, it was part of the deal for me to buy the car.  Yet, not one person didn't agree about the warranty plus it was a safety issue.  The points that secure the driver side floor matt were missing.  I was phoned about making an appointment for this and a couple other things that came with the sale.  (Alarm install and such).  I was told anytime, so I selected a Monday morning for drop off before I went to work.  I was assured that was fine and total, everything would only take a few hours.  So I could pick up my car after work.  Well all day I never got a call.  I called in late afternoon and was told, well no it's not done yet, but tomorrow for sure.  Ok fine.  When I picked up my car, not only was not everything done, (the floor matt still not fixed) but I find out me dropping my car off on Monday did nothing.  No one that was necessary to do any of the listed items worked on Mondays.  That was a standing schedule.  The person scheduling me and making the appointment should have known that. (I really should have known something was wrong at drop off when the guy checking in my car seemed confused when I said I had an appointment for this stuff)  Now here we are 6 weeks later and the floor matt issue is still not fixed.  Apparently it requires the service manager's approval, even though it is warranty.  Even the gentlemen in sales argued for me but couldn't get an approval directly.  It must come from Mark, the service manager.  They insist they are asking him.  But not only do they still not have an answer, but I had to start calling daily and leaving  messages with his staff.  Still NOTHING!!!  This is stupid!  At lest everyone I do get on the phone seems very pleasant.  But that doesn't get my car fixed unfortunately.

Again, SALES-GREAT!!!!!  Service-eh.  I did finally get the manager on the phone and he was really nice once I got to him.  We will see how things go now that I know first hand he is aware of what I need.  I hope to be able to raise the overall star rating when this is all complete.  I really hate giving negative reviews as I know everyone can have an off day.  But 6 weeks of consistent results, or lack there of, isn't an off day.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<user_name>Wes Steph< /user_name><Time>1345859088594< /Time><rating>5</rating><text>I recently purchased a Nissan Juke from Mossy Nissan Escondido. They were super patient and gave us a good price without any effort, as well as a fair trade in value. I enjoyed dealing with the sales manager Jason Koehn, he was very up front about everything and doesn't play games. He's also very honest and says it like it is, we enjoyed his humor through the process. The sales people are very friendly and eager to help even when another dealer will be getting the commision. Our original sales person, Ramez Deeb, has greeted us every time I've seen him and helped us any way he could every single time.

I pre-ordered a second car from Nissan, and George Barouta at Mossy Escondido went above and beyond showing me the cars, taking measurements, and helping any way he could. He put no pressure on me and was super easy to deal with. Mossy Escondido was the best experience I've had at a dealership ever! Unfortunately Nissan (Not Mossy) took forever to send my car and when I ended up selling my current car, I had to go to another dealership (since I could no longer wait for the car with trim I wanted). It was then I realized how different the experience can be and just how good Mossy Nissan Escondido is. The other dealer promised the world and then tried to rip me off, I had to walk out the door with my cash offer before they ran out and eventually got close enough that I didn't drive away without a car, and then only because I had checked every other dealer around 3 counties and knew this was the only one with my car. I've only had one service so far with Mossy Escondido and it was great, supper fast service by appointment, they washed the car and detailed the tires for free with the great priced service.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dbf4ed09a2042d:0x221014e2f3e11198</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Ron the assistant manager and my salesman George at Mossy Nissan are always there to help me or my wife whenever we need help or have a question. George, man that dude is a hustler. I really think he should slow down. Lol. So far I couldn't be more pleased with this Dealership.<//Review>
