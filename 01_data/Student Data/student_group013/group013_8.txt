Great taxi experience ,love the service last seven pick ups  on time . This company is actually located here in the city of Oxnard.  Tried a couple of other services who claim to be in town and they were always running late or no show . Yes recommend this taxi service if you need transportation on time and fare prices.👌</Review>

Very dirty business
Lousy, unprofessional, lazy and definitely misleading advertisement. Do yourself a favor stay away from this joky joke company. What a mistake, I called them to pick me up from Oxnard train station and it was late night and cold, the driver at the same time dispatcher said he will be there and he never did show up. One hour waiting time, nothing. I had no other option to call another company and wait another 20 min on top of the 1 hr I waited for this joky joke company to pick me up. I believe all these reviews 5 stars here are just a lie. You should be ashamed of yourself providing a low quality customer service. Never again use this joky joke Oxnard taxi.<//Review>

I am instead appalled by the services I was not rendered on Thursday, March 16th in between 3p-4p. I had a boot on my car on s oxnard going north. The dispatcher at same time driver was named James and telling him this, he stated he needed an address. Well, I was standing on front of a school that was being demolished so I could not give an exact address. I told him I would walk down to McDonald's on s oxnard he kept telling me oxnard blvd I told him the McDonald's was down by the south Place but he was adamant about oxnard Blvd (Go figure?!). I never saw a cab and now, they don't want to reimburse me the $46.80 they took from ONLY half of it! Well, THIEVES AND LIARS WILL REAP WHAT THEY SOW!!!!! I WILL NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO ANY OF MY COLLEAGUES, FAMILY, OR FRIENDS!!!! If you felt what you did to me was professional and honest, I will allow GOD to deal with chaotic mindsets!!!! YOUR SPIRITS DON'T BARE FRUIT!!!!</review>

First and last time I use a taxi. It cost me $40 for this ride that would normally cost me $10 through Uber. Also the drivers aren’t as kind or professional and their cars stink. Sorry but no thanks.
The driver was actually very dirty and looks he needed a shower</Text>

<Review>No base access. Do not all  if you need to and from base. I called an hour before pick up to verify if the “company” has a driver for base access available. They said yes no problem. Called The 2nd time to get picked, again verified base access. Finally, when the “driver” picked me up I again verified that he could get on base.. after the 15 minute drive and $33 fair. Upon arrival, he stated he DID NOT HAVE ACCESS therefore could not drive me on. Victim of the old bate and switch. We argued this conflict in the parking lot he allows the fair meter to keep ticking $$ away. The driver, company and dispatcher are all one person.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1553122720306, 'text': 'Sorry for the confusion Justin you have us confused with another company in the area we never told you we had base access none of the company’s in the area do.But what you forgot to mention was that we only charged $25 dollars on your cc we gave you $6.00 off the meter to try to make you happy.😃 take care and hope your day goes better for you.'}< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80e84c2a4c09eb15:0xa1061bfb630bd433<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I called Oxnard Taxi to take me from Car Max in Oxnard to Camarillo.  The cab arrived exactly when the service said they would.  The car was very clean and very comfortable.  The driver was named Amber and she was really nice.  She is a confident driver, never caused me any discomfort and got me to my destination very efficiently.  I rarely use a cab, but I would call Oxnard Taxi again, and ask for Amber.</text><Time>1533146510355< /Time>< username>

Many year resident I have been dangerously stranded by third party services that claim to be on the ball but call you about the time your cab is scheduled to arrive and say, "unfortunately we will not be able to accomodate your request at this time". This is the only service I have found where you are in touch with the driver and you know almost exactly when they will arrive. I really appreciate a service I can count on.< /Text>

<Review>I was going to be late for work, then i called this cab and they got me there within 20 minutes, it was great because the cab was super cheap compared to prior cabs, i couldn't have asked for better service either so 5 stars< /Review>< pictures>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Hello my name is  Cristal My experience and my opinion of Oxnard Taxi is that they are by far the best cab service # 1 in town. They are always on time for the most part and if they are running a few minutes late they always call and let me know.NOT LIKE THE OTHER TAXIS IN TOWN ALWAYS LATE OR Don't SHOW UP!!!!! I use their services 3 times a week to take my child to school and they are very trustworthy people would not trust anyone else. Drivers very nice and cars very clean and up to date. We really appreciate their services. And here is a little "FYI" return customers get 20% percent off the meter 😀</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

me and my cousin had to get back home fast before my momma showed up cause we werent supposed to be kicking it at the walmart but we called and this taxi came in clutch😩👌👌 they came in under 10 minutes and they had an amazing AC, like we were sweating and so dehydrated and yall know oxnard is HOT, like the heat just came outta nowhere this summer, and when we got in the car it was just cool, crisp air in the car I was like, oh my lord thank you for disss. it was super clean too (super nice fragrance) and the driver was really chill and kind( I hope you doing good dude). excellent service, i would definitely reccommend and call again if I ever need to dip🤞🤞🤞

<text>Very bad, I called and told they would be at my location in 15 mins. So I waited over an hour and nobody came. I called again and they came to me finally. When I entered I asked the driver why did it take so long and he yelled at me and made fun of me. I then told him my destination and drove there. While on the drive getting there he asked me questions that made me uncomfortable and I had enough and left at a red light. Worst company ever please don't use them and find something else thank you.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Time>

So, im not from the area, so i have nothing to compare... called for a cab because 2 different bars would not let me in with a bicycle (i rode up here on my bike from san diego) and since this town has such awesome streets, i got my first flat so far on my trip- forcing me to get a cab back to my hotel... guy on the phone was nice, and cab showed up quickly, but phone number on cab didnt match what i called so i sat there for a minute until i got a phone call, from a dude 6 ft away that barely spoke english, but hey i barely speak spanish so we'll call that a draw. We load up my bike and i get in the car and the guy goes " $15?" At this point im sick of oxnard and im like sure, lets stop at 7-11 on the way. I gave him $20 to be nice, but the meter was never turned on-thats messed up... i tipped this guy fat because i felt like he was being taken advantage of... i most likely wont return to this town again, but if i do and need a cab, wont be calling these guys.</text>

UNRELIABLE AND VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE. STAY AWAY IT’S A FAKE SERVICE.
I called the night before to make a reservation and a guy over the phone took my information and I did explain to him that I have a medical appointment for a procedure. Next day I called it went voicemail, I called again voicemail, finally the guy picked the phone and said oh i am off today. What a joke !! I dare you. This is a fake service, and I strongly believe all these 5 Star reviews are as fake as their service. Do yourself a favor don’t let today's disappointments cast a shadow on tomorrow's dreams. Stay away!!!!< /Text>

Worst cab !! Overpriced and the car was very dirty. $32.15 for 4 miles !

I'd give 0 stars if I could, maybe even negative. A car showed up by the name of taxi taxi ....the driver identified himself by James, while going from Oxnard transit center to the river park collection , they charged us $32.15 for 4 miles driving WAY EXAGGERATED (double what another cab charged to take us from OTC TO COLLECTION We were in a hurry, so no choice. I did call Oxnard Police and report this scam co. Beware and ask what you're getting before committing.<//Text>

I had a very bad experience with Oxnard taxi taxi. Not only that I had to wait for 40 minutes for the driver to pick me up but they also overcharged me. For only 3.6 miles I was charged $25.
Stay away, they will rip you off.<//review>

< Review>
Poor service, price changed from $38.00 to $65.00 Rip off !!

I called ahead for a quote as I was arriving on a train. From point A to point B, i was quoted about $38.00, for an approximately 10.0mi ride. When I got in the cab, I opened up Google Maps to follow progress, and watched as the driver took his own way, not even using GPS in the car. The 10.0mi ride turned into a 17.6mi ride that also consisted of a tolled road, that was completely unnecessary, costing me $65.00 Upon calling and complaining, I was told that there was nothing they could do for me. I will never use this service again.
All his 5 stars reviews are 100 % fake. The time frame between each review is one day or one week. How come someone overcharge customers and can't take responsibility for initial fare and have all these 5 stars reviews ?
Look each date of each reviews.....they were posted in all same day and you realize that is all fake.</Review>

My best kept secret. This is where I buy my AGM batteries for my solar array. $80 12 VOLT GROUP 27 batteries. This business deals in price. Many other auto batteries available. 50's style decor. Very nice touch.< /review>

In my own opinion i am to believe that favoritism for the Mexican American community is played out in this business even tho other signs may indicate the opposite.   They say they have warranty for batteries but only if shown the battery  original receipt is shown apparently there is miscommunication upon the subject.  Gave only 2 stars one for having the battery and 1 for having communication upon installation...if you disagree with this review please feel free to visit the place yourself.< /Text>

A place where your treated like a customer not an ATM . Your dollars think its 1985. No charges for installing. With good products guaranteed!!!! Great people have saved myself and others thousands over many years. Car, truck, diesel truck - wheelchair and scooter batteries.<//Review>

If I could leave no stars I would! This place sells junk thats why all the batteries are cheap. Do yourself a favor and get a battery from Costco. New and cheaper than getting robbed by this place. Bought one of their "better" used car batteries and car was still having battery issues. Took it to two different places to be tested and both places tested the battery to be bad 👎  I took it back and they gave me another which was also tested bad. Went to get my money back and the bald guy at the counter got nasty. Hurling insults and threats of violence to have me removed. I waited there until his boss told him to give me my refund over phone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. The Interstate battery store and Costco are just up the street go there instead.</text>

Bought a new battery and had to return it 3 weeks later. I was given another one but I question their definition of "new". I will check this one out carefully. Stay tuned....< /review>

Fair and honest pricing and professional service. Been going to them for years.. I definitely recommend them when your car needs a battery. Their technique in the refurbishing process of their batteries guarantees 6 months for a fraction of the cost of a new battery. Sometimes they last longer than a new one. Good stuff. Check em out.<//Review>

<review>Came to Power Shop Batteries on a recommendation of a friend, and I'm extremely grateful I did. Great service, great prices, and and honest employees. Another battery shop said I needed a new alternator, and they had one to purchase. But Power Shop said it was just my battery itself, and I was able to purchase a new battery at a great price! Highly recommend this place for all your battery needs!!</review><rating>5</rating><user_name>Garrett Hill</user_name></record></dataset><record>

<text>Excellent service, friendly staff and was given several choices of the right battery for my RV as well as different prices and no pressure to purchase.

🕶👍🏼 This is the spot! My Pop has shown me this place and now I tell my kids. This is where you go when you need a battery.  They even changed my battery out for me while I waited. Wow, old skool customer service. Thanks guys!<//Review>

Don’t waste your time nor money on these crooks dead batteries  after dead batteries all they  provide okay cool 1 year  warrantee  Here comes the  second hand me down  recycle used battery. Good way to  destroy your alternator and starter. ( beware  it’s not your ALTERNATOR. It’s the bad cells in the batteries< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Do yourself a favor and if you need a cheap temporary battery you can get that here (will last a month or two)  buy the cheapest model they have. Don’t invest in the ones with the warranty because they don’t honor it. They will pull out a archaic battery tester and say it’s fine. Even after you had the battery tested at two different places were they showed you the battery has bad cells. They won’t honor the warranty but they will try and sell  you another junk yard battery  at a discount.</text>< GmapID>

Great low prices on used & new car batteries. Prices are: $25, $35, &50(new). They even remove your old battery and replace it with the one you just bought with no extra charge. Just save your receipt if anything happens. Fast & friendly service.</Text>

<review>**keep your receipt** I bought a battery here two years ago that was guaranteed for 4 years. Well it started acting up and stank really bad. Brought it in and they applied the pro-rate to a new one. Great deal, great service!< /review><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

My gripe with this place is: it is hot and dirty and they gave you the battery washed in what smells like a kerosene and gasoline mixture. If you carry it in the cabin of your car like I did, the fumes will make you throw up.< /Review><Rate>3<//Rate>< Response>

Bought 2 batteries from this place 1 works no problem the other one won't start with out a jump took it in boss man said it was my alternator wouldn't replace the battery even with me having the 4yr warranty on it. Report this place to the BBB. Went to AutoZone bought a new one no problem.. They even tested the alternator and nothing wrong with it.< /Review>

Don’t waste your money or time here. Every battery I bought from there was broken , the charge lasted  about 3 to 6 months and then I had to replace it They last just long enough for the warranty to run out. They won’t refund your money.</Review>

<Text>Terrible place, bought a "new battery" for over $60 installed it and didn't even start my vehicle. Have them the benefit of the doubt removed the battery and charged fully. Also checked my charging system very thoroughly with the correct tools and reinstalled the battery. Same problem...would not start vehicle without a jump.  So I return to the shop 2 days later, the GUY (boss man) acts like I'm not standing right in front of him then says "what do you want?" I told him I honk the battery is dead, he said let's look at it. He "tested it" with his janky volt meter that read incorrect voltage. He was convinced my chagrin system was faulty, and didn't want to swap out the battery.

NOTE : the battery I purchased comes with a 6 month warranty.

With the same vehicle I went to O'reilly auto parts, bought yet another battery and installed it. Not a single problem, vehicle starts every time, and reads the correct voltage when vehicle is running and off.

Dirty shop, dirty grimy workers, boss has terrible customer service trying to make every little dime possible without taking care of customers.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

Power Shop Battery is an absolute rip off. I purchased four so called new batteries and got some BS run around when one went dead after two weeks. The fool at the front desk said it was a bad connection that drained it dead and there would be no warranty.  I had also purchased a  used battery that was worthless. I was baited by the low price.  I would advise under no circumstance should anyone do business with them. They are ignorant and flat out liars!< /review>

Thefts,  be careful with this place if you lost receipt  they don't recognize their own new batteries even if buy it same day. 4 times I been there same complaints from customers.  They are not honest,  go Costco or sams pay extra 40dlls you will have a real warranty,</Text>

<date>1441530323159</date><rating>1</rating><review>Terrible place, bought a "new battery" for over $60 installed it and didn't even start my vehicle. Have them the benefit of the doubt removed the battery and charged fully. Also checked my charging system very thoroughly with the correct tools and reinstalled the battery. Same problem...would not start vehicle without a jump.  So I return to the shop 2 days later, the GUY (boss man) acts like I'm not standing right in front of him then says "what do you want?" I told him I honk the battery is dead, he said let's look at it. He "tested it" with his janky volt meter that read incorrect voltage. He was convinced my chagrin system was faulty, and didn't want to swap out the battery.

NOTE : the battery I purchased comes with a 6 month warranty.

With the same vehicle I went to O'reilly auto parts, bought yet another battery and installed it. Not a single problem, vehicle starts every time, and reads the correct voltage when vehicle is running and off.

Dirty shop, dirty grimy workers, boss has terrible customer service trying to make every little dime possible without taking care of customers.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Horrible customer service. Be careful. The "warranty" they claim to give you is FALSE when an issue does arise. They will claim it is not the battery but your vechile instead which was not the case after having my vechile examined. Go somewhere else 0/5 stars< /Text>

I purchased a batterie here for the first time about 1 month ago and they installed it very quickly and I was very happy with their service.
Will come back again.</Text>

Do not waste your money I bought several batteries here for my vehicles and had to replace them in about 7 months I thought there was something wrong with the car so the next time I bought a battery I took it straight to a different store to get it tested and it was no good and they refused to give me money back< /review>

(Translated by Google) Cochinero of batterias last a very short time and you return them and do not change fabrics, they design you if it works, the mechanic does not recommend them because it damages the alternators.

<Text>I have been going to the Court for 6 years now and every time I leave im always satisfied 100%. I have had the pleasure of having Grandpa cut my hair first, then I was passed down to Steven when he retired! I am a customer for life here, thanks for all my hair cuts Steven!!

<Text>Went here for the first time in at least 12 years. Long time between visits not because of service but due to the fact that I shave my head. Went in to have my beard trimmed.

This is our first time going to this barber shop and they were very friendly and talkative and they have very good cuts for all types of hair. I would give this place  a 10 out of 10.<//text>

<Text>I came from ohio to see my maw out here and she said this place was good.
Well, I was doubtful because my Barber in my small town is pretty good but I gave it a shot and wasn't disappointed
I didn't catch her name but the woman furthest down by the tv did my straight shave.
I was a little doubtful on how good she would do but man did she prove me wrong! Honestly better then my Barber in ohio.
Anytime I come back this Barber Shop will be my first stop!
Thanks for making this experience so great and go blue !<//Text>< gmapID>

<review>Okay, first off, do not waste your time here.

I went into the barbershop today, and it took an hour and 15 minutes to cut my hair. I would not mind that if the haircut looked nice, but there was no blending of the "fade" he gave me. I asked him to do some things for me, he said he "could not because my hair wasn't ready to be cut that short" so I accepted it, went to another barber and they did exactly what I asked for. Not only that, dude also used a straight razor on my head, that had to have been the dullest razor that's ever touched my head. My Gillette razor gets a closers shave than that garbage. The straw that broke the camels back, that made me write this review.. After everything I looked at my hair in the mirror, and the line up was so uneven, fade so unblended, I was so furious I just accepted the fact that I'm going to pay for another haircut today.

All in all, just go to a barber with well reviews, not this one.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

< Review>
Decent little exchange on DLI, it has all the uniform items needed for each branch of service and all the basic items one would need to get situated on base. No real grocery items minus alcohol, bread isle, frozen foods and the like. There is a tailor and a sushi restaurant inside the exchange. The clothing section is good for service members on post but for families and more selection stick to the internet or mall.</Review>

< Review>
I am sorely disappointed in the quality of the civilian wear that our young warfighters have available for purchase at the Defense Language Institute in Monterey. The military apparel seems of good quality but the Under Armour tees among other nonmilitary gear is of poor quality and the designs on the tees are unimaginative along with a poor selection of colors. One would think that with our huge defense budget we could provide a better selection of civilian wear for our warriors.< /Review>

Came here for the buffet the other day. Some dishes were hit or miss, and I'd lower the price a bit if I were them, until the quality of the ingredients improves.</Text>

Nice place nice people and tasty food. Easy place to find and notice from a car. Limited seating inside, but quite a selection on the menu. There is free parking.</text>

This place knows how to take care of their clients. Consistently with a super nice attitude. The food is fairly priced, always flavorful and clean.< /review>

< review>
So I had been a customer of this location along with my family. However, I work for Grubhub and had to pick up an order here. The lady at the register was very rude and asked me to wait outside for the order. I would understand if the restaurant was full, but the restaurant was almost empty. There really is not any need to be rude to people who are trying to work, specially when it is a restaurant that should be focusing in customer service. I was not a customer that day, but I have been in the past. Delivery workers can become potential customers, I often pick up dinner from some of the locations I made deliveries from.  Again, please rethink on how you treat delivery drivers and refrain from being rude.</review>

The food was bad, my mother's plate was super salty while mine had no flavor, the guy messed up our order and when we asked for details about a specific dish he seemed tongue tied. Not to mention the food wasnt just bad but very expressive too, our first and last time going.< /review>

Really good food and the servings are really good. I definitely recommend yucca frita as an appetizer. They have plenty of amazing main dishes to choose from. The staff is super friendly. It has very nice atmosphere. It's a great place to have a family dinner or to take a date.<//Text>

Food is pretty good. Prices are a little high but some plates have generous portions. I ordered duck and even though it was well cooked and tasted amazing... it was already lukewarm when served :^[</review>

I'm Peruvian and the food they serve is the closest you can get to the original. If you haven't try el pollo alabraza, do yourself a favor and order it. You won't regret it.</text>

Food tasted okay. Price was decent; about 15 dollars per person. Ambience was super relaxed and family oriented. They have TVs and display sports. Parking is not the best here. Service was missing a bit due to it being busy. It seems like they only had 2 servers for the whole place. Overall, I definitely think there is room for improvement.... will definitely try again.<//Review>

This is the most disgusting food I've ever tried.  Looks like they just throw leftovers in a pan and call it a dish. Place smells & looks dirty, workers look dirty & their deserts are behind a glass by the register  uncovered . They're selling bread that says "Merry Christmas " for goodness sake we are in May .< /Review>

Amazing food. The Lomo Saltado is by far the best I've seen and tasted. The beef was cooked perfectly and infused with lots of flavor. Definitely a good place to eat with family. Very clean and attentive staff.<//Text>

Its pretty decent. Food is pretty authentic and the portions are just right. Food can sometimes come out a bit salty and the decor doesnt equal some of the prices they are charging for a plate. We've been mostly happy, although sometimes when we asked for bread, we got the "stale B stock". Oh well, as long as you dont ask for "extra's" you should be ok.</Text>

Everything was so salty from rice, chicken cooked two ways, ceviche. Only salad & french fries not salty. The amount of salt I ate is equivalent to what  I would normally  eat  in two weeks. I'm a food connoisseur.

It should be name " EL INEDIBLE "<//review></record></dataset><record>

This was our first time at a Peruvian restaurant. My husband had a beef dish with rice and fries and I had the chicken milanese with pesto spaghetti. We both loved the food as well as the friendly and speedy service.</Text>

The staff was friendly. The food was served in a timely manner.
In coming to this restaurant, maybe I was comparing this one to one I've frequented over the years in North Hollywood a lil too much.
While the food had it similarities, there were also the not so subtle differences.
The huancaina sauce was a lil too eggy, and the green salsa could've been a lil creamier.
The saltado de camaron and saltado de pollo we're good, and the Inca cola was nice and cold.
Nice atmosphere, with soothing music.
My overall experience was just above average, but try it. You may like it.</Text>

<text>The worst Peruvian food I ate....as Peruvian I know exactly the taste of our traditional peruvian cousine..Any Peruvian who ate at this place will agree my review...NO PERUVIAN TASTE AT ALL!!!!!  This place sucks.....Papa a la Huancaina, was a milky sauce with color....Tallarines verdes con Milanesa....horrible, no taste at all, and Milanesa was like rubber....worst decision to have lunch at this restaurant...Hope they get a better cook....< /text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Small but filled with lovely spiritual people. We are a home to lots of groups for their meetings. We have Kairos, Movimiento Misionero, km2 and other church groups including all the sacramental ones.

This is my church growing up and I’ve never seen it thriving so much as much as these last couple of years as far all the different groups that have their meetings here. I just wished they would attend mass here too every week but due to that they come from many different areas, it may be more convenient for them to attend a church that is closer to them on a Sunday but I hope they remember to support us still. Especially now that we can give our offering online!
God help us.< /Review>

<UserId.>116741017822120288343< /UserId.><Name>Etlecil HEWL</Name><Time>1621615564002< /Time><rate>1< /rate><review>UPDATE -  Manager, Jeanine, has been very helpful and diligent in helping me solve my concerns and reaching a mutual understanding... I’m hopeful for a more peaceful stay at Corona Pointe.

1. Move in day I was given a completely different apartment then the one promised. The apartment they showed me had hardwood flooring no carpet in common areas updated cabinets and appliances along with mirrors on closet doors. I specifically asked if it was the same as the apartments that I would be getting and I was told yes. Much to my surprise I got completely something different... carpet in all common areas really old cabinets with pest problems. In addition to no mirrors on closet doors and very poorly painted walls, cabinets, etc. appliances are old dyer barely dries. They finally came to spray my apartment but I still have a serious spider problem in my balcony which supposedly they take care of. In the middle of a pandemic it’s too much to have people coming in and out of my apartment with two kids.
2. There is homeless people constantly digging in our trash cans for recyclables. Then make a mess of the trash cans and throw the trash outside of the trash cans which is disgusting. Not to mention they’re constantly walking through our complex which is not safe.
3. Like previous reviews have stated the water is always getting shut off sometimes I don’t even give you a notice it just happens and your water goes off. I’ve had at least four scenarios where I had to call and ask why my water was off only to find out they had to do an emergency shut off with no communication. Only to receive communication hours later when the water is back on. It’s no joke it literally gets shuts off about 8-10 times a year. Sometimes weekly. You would think they would put a deeper investment into fixing what they need to fix to avoid the same problem.
4. They have broken into our mailboxes plenty of times. We’re supposed to have security but your guess is better than mine. I never see them.
5. Front directory is trashed and not legible. Food deliveries are a pain because they have nothing to reference.
6. I have been promised I would be on the waiting list for a two bedroom apartment and twice now with two different people I have been completely ignored. Once with Kristen and I believe no longer works there and one with Amelia I believe is her name. You literally will have to call them and remind them you’re on the waiting list and they will not have your name on the waiting list to upgrade to a bigger apartment. I wanted a two bedroom because I truly enjoy their amenities but such a lack of unprofessional communication is extremely frustrating specially when you’ve been a good resident.
7. It’s supposed to be non-smoking but you will see worker smoking in the front entrance. You will also see cigarette butts all over. They will walk buildings and be a pain in the butt when it comes to your patio. They literally post a notice for everything. You can’t even have your child scooter in your patio with that being a problem. Mind you nobody should be looking into your patio and violating your privacy in that way.
8. Parking sucks. You will not find a spot after 5-6 pm.
9. The leaf blower leaves all over your front porch. The trees are not maintained so they shed all over patio in balcony. You will literally have to be cleaning and sweeping and raking daily. They have a Bee problem in every bush and more so by patio bushes. Pet feces all over grass EVERYDAY!
And last one which kind of broke the camels back… I had the unfortunate experience of coming home to a patio notice on my front door. The notice stated I couldn’t have my  workout equipment on my patio which mind you it’s not stated in my rental agreement. If you walk the complex there are many violations being ignored with no notice posted. They will single you out. They have disrupted our peace here. We are good residents, clean, not disruptive family of 4. It sucks that we have to up & move our children from what they know as home because of this harassment and unfair treatment during a pandemic.< /review>< Pics>

We decided on it because all appliances are furnished and included in rent, especially full-sized washer and dryer in our very own laundry room next to the kitchen. Since then we've been pleasantly surprised by all the other attributes of this place, such as the help and support from their prompt, top-notch maintenance team. The facility went under new management seamlessly and was redesigned into Corona Pointe Resort, complete with concierge services, scheduled events, new equipment in the fitness center, new pools, jacuzzis, and lush patio furniture. But the maintenance team is what makes or breaks a living facility, and at the rate they continue to impress, Corona Pointe Resort could overcome just about any catastrophe!</text></record>

I have lived at Corona Pointe Resort for over 2 years now and am very happy here ☺ The apartments are so well maintained and the location is great. I haven't had any complaints so far and management is on top of everything. The leasing office genuinely cares about the residents here and have addressed any concerns or maintenance requests as quickly as they could. I'm definitely happy with calling Corona Pointe home<//Review>

<Review>Although this is an enormous complex it maintains a family like atmosphere. There are several swimming pools, playgrounds, meeting rooms and barbeque areas for the  tenants and their guest.  They offer 24 hour security and daily planned  activities which contribute to the feeling of being at a resort.</Review></record>

Everyone is so polite and helpful.  Where I lived previous to Corona Pointe Resort the office people were so rude and my maintenance was never done.  I feel like I won the lottery.  I've only had one problem with my neighbor and the manager was very professional and took care of my issue right away.  Thank you Corona Pointe Resort for my beautiful home!

<time>1596486883953</time><Rate>5< /Rate><name>Bella Diaz< /name><Review>I've lived here for about a year with my fur baby and it 's been first apartment. From signing the lease, everything was easy and smooth. The apartment itself is so spacious for a one bedroom and my parking space is right across from my apartment. My guests never have any trouble finding parking when they come to visit either. The area is nice and quiet and I always feel safe, even when I come home super late at night. The leasing office is always so helpful with answering any questions that I have. And my favorite thing is that it's conveniently located right across the 91 freeway! I honestly love that I chose Corona Pointe as my first apartment. I highly recommend this apartment complex! ☺< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Worst apartments in riverside county ! 3 months into my lease my ac/heater broke. Maintenance will come to my house almost every day just to do a quick fix. Plenty of nights and me and my daughter were left without AC or heat. I made the “MOTHERLY” decision and broke my lease since no one made it a priority to find out what was causing the unit not to work. I am now receiving a $6000 bill which I will be passing to my attorney. All this place cares about is the money. Apartment has roaches and all they are willing to do is spray. Save yourself the headache!!</text>

<review>I would have loved to live here. The amenities and apartment that we viewed would have been perfect for us. The price seemed fair and the management seemed competent. Unfortunately, I was working with a manager who was walking me through the application process for an open unit. I had applied, and was told that the unit was ours over the phone with a conformation that our application was received. After 3 days of not hearing back from our background/credit check, I called and was told that someone else had the apartment. My family of 3 is in the process of moving and thought we had a place to call home. Now I am scrambling to find a place to live after turning down other places for this one.</review><user_id>100203566100454408759< /user_id>< time>

I've been living here for a year and a half now and all I can say is great things about Corona Pointe. The complex is always getting cleaned by the maintenance guys, leasing office is always there to answer your questions, and the service requests are answered quickly and fixed immediately. My husband and I are going to be moving out after our lease is up to buy a home and I sure am going to miss this place! Corona Pointe has definitely been home to us. :)<//text>

<Text>I've been here for 6 months now and I love it. I have a 2 bed, 2 bath apartment with my boyfriend and our 2 fur babies. The complex is a great for first timers and the amenities are clean and great as well. My favorite amenity during this hellish heatwave is definitely the pool! I love how there are about 5 pool areas in the complex, so you always have options if a few are full. Another thing I love about this CPR is that the staff is very quick to respond to your service requests and they get the job done right the first time. The location is great, we're OC commuters so we love that it's right across the street from the 91-W. I honestly don't know what the deal is with all the negative reviews because our experience has been nothing but great here! I highly recommend Corona Pointe Resort!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I've been waiting for 2 weeks to get a copy of my credit check after they declined me. I've spoken to 4 people about this. They take your money knowing you're not going to get approved. Honestly i think they are running a scam and that's why they don't want to give me a copy of the report. Beware. I've heard more and more companies are doing this.<//Review>

My experience at Corona Pointe Resort has so far been nothing short of amazing. The facility is beautiful, the location is great (right across the freeway), all of the pools are clean, and the rest of the  amenities here at Corona Pointe are amazing. Been here for 3 years and I still love it.<//review>

< review>
I've been living here for about 3 weeks now. This review is a reflection of my time here thus far.

Pros: Maintenance staff is prompt with service request and extremely friendly. They greet you even as you are walking about the property. The premises is well kept as well as all the public shared spaces (pool, BBQ's, dog park, tennis courts). Convenience of having a washer/dryer in the apt is definitely a plus. leasing office was available for all questions and responded between 1-2 business days during the process of applying.

cons: not seeing the apartment you are signing your lease for. My apartment was NOT move in ready. I have had to submit a plethora of service requests for small things that should have been fixed prior to my moving in. The apartment was NOT updated. The cabinets are extremely old, and have lazy paint jobs. They hinges on all doors and cabinets were painted over with paint and just allows for a tacky look. The interior trim in the apartment is loose and poorly installed. it is also showing cracks in certain places.  The restroom was a mess- the toilet was not secured at all at the time of move in & the drain to the tub was clogged and the tub is not installed properly. They refuse to fix the tub since it is not noticeably broken.  The apartment was not thoroughly cleaned prior to move in either. There was thick layers of dirt between appliances and in corners and crevices of the apartment. I had to do a deep clean on the apartment and the carpet in the bedroom. After steam cleaning the carpet, the water was disturbingly dirty for having been "cleaned" before my move in. All the cabinets in the kitchen are old and have had so many coats of paint they stick to the wood when trying to open them. There are plenty of small details through out this apartment but theses are just the main highlights.

overall, my advice to anyone considering moving in: urge/request to look at the exact apartment you are moving into. Ensure that all the appliances are working and that the apartment itself will be move-in ready.

definitely regret moving in here. i would have rather allocated my money somewhere else.< /review>

I have lived here for 9 months and I wanted to leave an honest and thorough review after having experience living here. This place has been nothing BUT, wonderful.

From my first time visit, lease signing, maintenance, customer service, and community experience, I would give this place more than 5 stars. I’ll try to keep this short and sweet.

When I first visited, the office staff greeted us with a smile, answered all of our questions enthusiastically, and with patience. I was helped by a lovely leasing agent named Shanelle. She was OUTSTANDING.

She mentioned (in the sweetest way possible) that my case was the most difficult she had ever seen. instead of giving up on me and choosing another tenant or waiting for a different applicant, she STILL worked with me and helped me out with a roof over my head in the crunched time frame that I asked for. She had a wonderful attitude throughout the entire process and if anyone were to inquire or apply to Corona Pointe Resort and would like a smooth process, ask for Shanelle. I wanted to leave this thorough review about her golden service so she knows how truly appreciative I am.

The front office staff were always so kind and ready to serve us with whatever questions we needed, and helped us out quickly and efficiently with any parcels that were left at the office.

Maintenance always always fixed any issue we had, and honestly they were pretty funny, easy going, and would always arrive in a preferred time frame. If you preferred for them not to enter your apartment without you being present they fully respected that and would come another time for when you were available.

As for management, during this Covid-19 era, it felt as if management truly did what they could to promote a happy and safe community by updating us effectively what will be the protocols for tenants and provided/delivered masks and hand sanitizer to our door as well!

Some miscellaneous details I appreciated was that the pools and foliage were always maintained, and they would repaint any areas that needed some sprucing up. You have the option to pay your rent online, I liked that my parking space was an assigned-covered spot, (you have the option to pay extra for a one car garage but I didn’t need it) they have a tennis court to play around in, most of my neighbors were friendly (thankfully), any updates from office staff to tenants would be through email and they would post a notice on our door to make sure we ever got an update if there would be an emergency water shut off, and last but not least, they have gorgeous light decor at the entrance, so I always looked forward to coming home at night.

Thank you Corona Pointe Resort for making my stay so pleasurable and memorable. This place is worth every penny.<//text>

UPDATED REVIEW: 7/15
My boyfriend and I love Corona Pointe so far! We've been here for 2 months and our apartment is AMAZING! We had to call maintenance for very minor issues, and they responded SO QUICKLY & did great work!  We instantly feel at home when we walk through the door. The staff keeps the grounds clean and as for the amenities, we ALL should understand that Covid hit hard and the complex had no choice but to follow the rules. When everything is open, there is no apartment complex out there in Riverside that has better amenities. The gym is great and all 3 pool areas are so beautiful! And those are just some of what is offered. Is it an inexpensive place to live?? Not really. But in life you get what you pay for.... and with Corona Pointe, you get excellence. Don't believe any negative reviews...honestly, this place is awesome. The entire staff at the leasing office is incredible! They are all very sweet and helpful. AND A SHOUTOUT TO EMILIA  If you want to live in a beautiful complex that is run by amazing people and in a prime location in Riverside, this is the place!!

5/31: ★★★★★ We have had such a positive experience moving in and living here! We worked with Emilia and she was incredibly helpful and kind ☺️ Our moving process and signing of documents was incredibly easy. I highly recommend working with Emilia if you are thinking of moving to Corona Pointe Resort!! Thank you Emilia ☺️< /Review>

I have lived in these apartments for almost two years and it is NOT A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE. Last month, my car was broken into, and the front office really couldn't care to be bothered. For a whole week my water heater, which is located directly next to my bedroom has been making very loud and grinding noises all day and throughout the night to the point in which I cannot even sleep and when I bring this up to the front office staff AND the property manager WITH VIDEO DOCUMENTATION OF THE NOISE, I am either ignored or told "oh it is just the wind" . DO NOT MOVE HERE, SAVE YOURSELF THE HEADACHE!!! THE STAFF IS UNPROFESSIONAL AND THE RENT IS MUCH TO HIGH TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH ISSUES LIKE THESE.<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>Do not move here. Besides being right off the 91 where a consistent flow of homeless people and garbage diggers are passing through, now we are dealing with the tires being taken off vehicles during the night when security is supposed to be patrolling. When I consulted the front office about this, asked what their plans were for amending it, I basically got a “it’s out of our hands, good luck” answer, if you want more security we have to raise rent. Which is already obscenely high for the tiny one bedroom apartment we live in, with no updates. Anyways, when I asked about a gated community option they said it would cause issues because “fire trucks and ambulances can’t get through” excuse me? I previously lived in a gated community and let me tell you, there is a way to get them in. That’s the most ridiculous excuse I’ve ever heard. Maybe they could add better lighting? Nope, unless we want higher rent! In a nutshell, they basically said there’s nothing that can be done. Getting out of this hell hole as fast as we can. If you want to charge $1500 a month for a tiny apartment,and call it a resort, then you should give your residents piece of mind that their belongings aren’t going to be stolen while they sleep.

Do not live here!
I have lived at here 2 years. It's so hard to find a parking spot , if you go home late. I took 45 minutes to find a parking spot 08/22/2018 10pm . It's even harder on weekend. once  I couldn't find a parking spot after spent 40 minutes at 11 pm . My car was parked at a half red line half normal side of street . There was no choice  and was not block the street. They towed away my car  .  My car front window have a resident permit ,They can easy find my number or knock my door, but they didn't .  They do nothing to the car without  register and park at resort overnight . They towed a helpless resident's car  who can not find a parking spot at home without contact. I have to pay over $400 to get back my car.   I tried to talk to them and writer a letter to them  , The service office lady was unfriendly and manager even don't want to meet me.  They are car can park at red line street, the side of street I was park there!<//text>

<text>I moved to this location earlier this year in January from the east coast. I often visited Los Angeles (for work) but did not want to live there. I was fortunate enough to discover Riverside, California and as well Corona Pointe Resort. I did not know what to expect as I never been or seen the complex. But Shanelle Dandy made sure everything was to my liking via phone and numerous emails. She did her best to make sure I was comfortable with the entire move. As of today, Shanelle continues to check in every now and then to make sure that my entire experience at Corona Pointe continues to be positive.

This is a  great place to call "home". The entire staff always greets you with a smile and are very helpful to my needs, and they are quick to attend to any problems that may arise . The grounds and facilities are kept clean every day by friendly courteous workers. The workout rooms are open 24/7, rarely crowded and the multiple pool areas are kept clean and attractive. I also love the convenience of covered assigned parking so I don’t have to worry about parking during the evenings. I live alone here and could not feel safer anywhere else.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>We have been living here for just over two months, but feel that there are many things that can be improved. Quality of the appliances is very poor, as well as the overall kitchen quality, water was shut down twice so far, but it was only for a few hours. The first night someone was parked in our spot, and it wasn’t resolved untill two days later when they were asked to move. Neighbors loud music is a problem, but trying to contact the office is a big hassle (we just had our call hung up on twice, one of the reasons that prompted me to write a review)

Overall the place is livable, there is a small ant problem but it’s manageable with raid, for the money you pay you do get a lot of amenities, but if you have more than one car in the household good luck.< /Review>< resp>

<review>It's home for now. Been here almost a year, and we'll see if they are going to raise the rent at the year mark. It's a nice place with lots of amenities. The staff is friendly and helpful.
1. I only wish that there was more of a noise barrier from the people upstairs.
2. Unfortunately, it's the tenants that make or break a community. If people weren't such slobs, this place would get 5 stars.
I feel that this place is less ghetto than other areas nearby. I am considering staying another year, depending on price. Many conveniences nearby. Grocery, restaurants, shopping mall, auto repair, freeway, etc.
Like all of California, it's stupidly expensive, but it's home for now.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_name>

I have lived here about 6 months no complaints great pools to swim in great staff I gave 4 stars because some appliances are little dated being tech guy would love to see newer NEST AC controler vs dated one or up to date fridge and washer and dryers and stove. Other then that great safe place to live parking is great if your smart about moving cars and know if you come home late going to be challenge so leave your covered spot open. Corona Pointe is far better then some of the surrounding communities.<//Text>

If I could rate nothing I would! I have never been so disrespected in my life and embarrassed... me and my husband went into the leasing office in search of a 2 bedroom apt and the woman helping us began by being very helpful, by bringing out the two bedroom information and showing us the price and even asking for our IDs and then she began asking us questions, how many of us where going to be living in the apt and if we had a pet and so on and then finally the winning question did any of us smoke... and my husband said yes, right when he said yes this stupid woman goes off! NO we can not rent to smokers and begins to put everything away and gives us our IDs and pretty much kicking us out! And everyone was watching this woman just go off saying NO to us because my husband smokes and he was trying to establish that if that’s the problem he would not smoke on the premises but this woman just went off NO NO NO omg it was horrible... I mean if your a professional how about u begin with those questions and then politely explain and then we would be on our way...but it’s fine life always has a way of returning the way you treat people, I’m just glad I didn’t have my babies with me, she’s a joke of a employee.< /review>

This place is AMAZING!!!!! I moved in about 2 months ago and the staff and leasing agents are very friendly, they have a patrol that's "on the spot" when you need them, the guest services and maintenance guys are incredibly helpful, and the amenities are superb! Yesterday as I was leaving my apartment complex they surprised everyone with free breakfast in to-go bags. They always have snacks available in the lobby, and they respond super fast when you need something. I'm so glad I made the choice to live here! No I do not work here and I'm not getting paid to say this. I'm just a really happy resident. :) Ask for Matt Bencomo at the front desk if you want to lease - he was awesome!!</review>

Great place to rent! I've lived here for 4 months now and I've yet to have any problems. It's quiet, well kept, and the few maintenance requests I've put in have been completed within a week. They have several amenities and are always doing little things in the office, for instance, tonight is pie night! The only inconvenience is the parking and trying to find a spot, mainly in the evenings, but it's like that at most places. I feel the rent is competitive for the area, I'm just hoping it doesn't get raised drastically after our first year is up. Kristin in the office is the sweetest too! Keep it up Corona Pointe! 😊<//review>

<rating>1</rating><text>Management is awful! Car break ins, no real security, car towing, apartments fall apart, maintence never comes, office doesn’t communicate properly. Good luck getting a call back.  Doesn’t care about their residents wants people to come and go. No lease renewals. Only month to month. They’ll ruin your life then kick you out for no reason. Rent is always going up. Water is always off, management is always a mess always giving out the wrong information, non reliable.</text></record>

<review>The front office does not communicate with the maintenance people what so ever. The front office takes days to get back to you and then when they do, they don’t communicate with others in the office so everyone in the office seems to call. The lack in communication these people have is very frustrating. Don’t ever expect to get anything done to your place if you live in those apts. or, be prepared to wait hand and foot for them to actually show up! Oh, let’s not forget, you are not able to have visitors with animals over to your apt either. So basically, you live in a prison with a backyard for no reason at all. I cannot wait for my friend to move out of that place! Also sounds like his upstairs neighbors have wood floors so you hear literally everything. They also have a little child who is the most rambunctious child I have ever heard in my life! They have no respect for their downstairs neighbor.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1506031357620, 'text': 'Valerie,\n\nWe are saddened to read that you are not fully satisfied with your home here at Corona Pointe.

<Review>Staff is wonderful, maintenance is responsive.  Grounds well kept.  First apartment experience after living in my own home for many years.  I was worried about the noise from other units but I find it soundproof and very quiet at night.  Lots of kids, college students and dogs but all very well behaved.  Exercise facility is great.  Haven't had a chance yet to try the pools but I look forward to it.

Only qualm was parking space was not close to unit but it has not been a problem and neighbors have been great about allowing me to unload after shopping and even ask if they can assist.  Otherwise, very unimposing.  New owners so I didn't have any experience with previous owners.  These guys have gone out of their way to make me welcome.<//Review></record>

My wife and I just got married. We moved in here 3 months ago, and we love it. There is new management, and they have really been making the place very nice. New pavement, 24/7 security everywhere, new no smoking policy, wonderful pools and amenities, concierge office. There are 700+ apartments, so be ready for some parking troubles occasionally, and don't expect them to immediately respond to minor maintenance issues; however, they have been pretty quick with the 3 things that we have needed fixed. I recommend this apt complex if you are looking for a moderately priced place that isn't gross.<//review>

We moved a month ago and we LOVE everything here!! Shanelle the Leasing Consultant is SUPER AMAZING- her positive attitude, upbeat personality is one of a kind.
Also, my kids enjoy the movie theater on a daily basis and they always come home sharing how NICE the Leasing people are.
And to top it off😉 my 11yr old girl brings me Starbucks Coffee Every Single Day Lol!! I think that's her way of showing me she's grateful for mom!❤ (Free Real Starbucks not fake or Keurig 🙃)<//review>

Plain and simple they DISCRIMINATE.

Residents are not treated equally, some recieve tow warning tags and some cars don’t. My car was randomly towed at 3am in my own parking spot since it was a brand new car with no plates, I had just came home with.  Yet everyone else recieves warning stickers of tow yet my car didn’t for some reason they decided it was meant to be towed right then an there. A car with car seats and diaper bags inside. When brought up to management they could only tell me sorry it’s a good tow we don’t know who’s car it was because it had dealer plates. ?? Yet again other cars recieve warning.

There solution for this was well right you a new month to month lease so we have no confusion of who’s car it really is, THEN they completely copied another residents lease and emailed it over for me to sign when confronted all the info was wrong and my deposit amount was far less than half the amount all they could tell me was oops sorry good thing you didn’t sign it. 👍🏼 . Clearly they don’t have a clue. Just an FYI TOWING HAPPENS DAILY.

Management is very rude. When anything is brought to their attention they have no solution whatsoever. If there are issues with neighbors they’re solution is to harrass the neighbors with pictures videos they also advise call security late at night just for “documentation”   Good one. Causing more confrontation.

Also, have been harassed by neighbor who has an issue with my 1.5 with a disability (mind you I’ve been here 3 years and this all happened in the past 3 months)  complaining he’s to loud while entering our home not even while inside.  Has made multiple complaints too office about him and for some odd reason management feels is a perfect reason to complain I’ve reiceved multiple noise complaints ( 3 day notices to comply or quit) when trying to settle things with the neighbor she made racist comments and was very aggressive and stated she’d say anything to make sure my family was evicted and I couldn’t figure out why? A family with two babies for some reason is completely hated with no expiration. Constantly made false reports to security claiming there were house parties, loud noises, banging on walls, when security arrived dad was bathing kids and I was in the kitchen cleaning up dinner. Security was in shock. Yet management didn’t do anything about the  repetitive false accusations. (Multiple occasions security came to my house and documented there wasn’t noise) they still gave me fasle noise complaints. They Completely chose her side even after proof had been brought to them. they felt it was best my son wasn’t a resident any longer.
RECIEVED A 60 day notice for him when addressed they said oh well that’s not why and when I asked why they told me well we don’t have an explanation at this time. Tried addressing with with the main manegment company left multiple messages never received a call back.

Also, today while enjoy spring break with my 4 year old, 1.5 year old and cousins ( all children ) by the pool which was completely empty with just our family no other residents at 12 in the afternoon we were confronted by management requesting to see my key and said that my guest needed to leave. When I asked why they lied to my face saying residents are only aloud to have 2 guest per household even in the home.  She told me “ sorry but you signed it in your lease” ... When I asked her to show me it in my lease she changed the subject. Told her I could pull the lease up on my phone she said Ill be talking to my manager and I’ll be back over. Never even returned.

Never in my 3 years of living her have I ever been approached about my guest. DISCRIMINATION AND HARRASMENT.

I’d highly discourage anyone to move her unless you have no kids. I’ve never been treated so poorly at a complex. No care for reisdent looking for a fast turn over to increase the rent. Not a family complex. My family has been completely harassed by this complex were we’ve been living here uncomfortably since Christmas time when it all started.<//text>

<review>RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN... Parking is the WORSE. Property next door is ALWAYS coming over here to park. What am I paying rent for? To participate in the parking wars? Also, there is a roach infestation problem. They have someone to spray but i swear it's pointless.

<Review>I have been here a year now, and I am up to renew my lease. at corona pointe resort apartments they are constantly trying to improve the complex (added dog park, new
BBQ ) and any time I've had an issue ( A/C) they were quick to resolve it. Price point feels fair. the only down side really is the parking. after 5pm. Good luck trying to find a spot.! which is why I say 4/5 stars. i would recommend family and friends if the were looking for a place.< /Review>< username>

<text>We all want safety, and if that's important to you,  this is not the place to live. We had a theft issue with our vehicle and when we went in to the office they said there is nothing they can do about it. They have the same response for everyone that complains, "we have a security patroling."  1 security is not enough for a place this big and half the time the security is just sitting at the entrance of the complex. I've spoken to a few of my neighbors and they have had their vehicles broken into and one even had his vehicle stolen, to which he himself later found at skyzone, a place not too far from here. They need a better security system here and better parking for their tenants.

The absolute worst apartment complex in the world. Our apartment was infested with roaches, and the water has been shut off TEN TIMES in the last two months. The staff will not assist you with anything. Any request you have will take at least a month to get back to you. Our rent has been raised $100 each year of living here as well.

There are also a number of child predators/registered sex offenders that live in the complex, please do not take your family here. Do not risk the safety of your loved ones to live here.</Text>

< review>
I lived here back in 2000, I just started my first job with the Disneyland Resort and found a roommate who was ready to move out from home and begin his life on his own just like me. We found this property when apartment hunting my roomie and I and immediately knew we were home. We stayed there for a year and then we moved out to start our own adventure in life. We made a lot of good memories at Corona Pointe, plus staff at the time was AWESOME and we never had drama, problems, or issues of any kind. Everything worked, nothing was never broken or nothing sucked, and when entering or exiting the 91frwy you were close to home because it was literally right of the entrance and exit to the freeway so that was a + for us. Corona Pointe thanks for all the fun and good times and for sending me on my own I guess to start my own life. It was Great!< /review>

<Text>Drove in just to take a look. Place isn't all that appealing at all. Worst of all I hear a lot of calls coming out of there. Sounds like a lot of crime. From the experience I had driving around the property I'd say I definitely don't intend on moving here< /Text>< rating>

Glad we moved out, lived there 2+ years, the last 2 weeks were the worst.  Dryer was overheating, they sent somebody to fix it and made it worse.  Ruben, the concierge, asked my wife to disconnect it, but she was too scared to touch it, she waited outside for me to get home from work.  The whole laundry closet and hallway were HOT, the dryer was off, but couldn't even touch it it was so hot.  Ruben had promised to have somebody come the next day but nobody ever came.  Between moving and other duties, we had no time to wait for them, we did laundry in a public laundromat.  When their CSR followed up to ask if our HEATER repair was ok, I told her the HEATER was fine, it was their dryer that was an issue and nobody came to fix it, ever.  I asked her to have her manager call me, manager never called.  Riley did call me back, she asked me to write an e-mail to her explaining what happened, and would have her manager call me, manager never called.  When I turned in my keys, I reminded Ruben of how negligent the whole thing turned out, and although I was leaving, still asked him to have his manager call me.  Still never got a response.  Picture shows how hot the dryer was when I got home that night, with wife and kids waiting outside hoping the dryer didn't cause a fire.  Among other things, the water was shut off sometimes before they put the notice on the door.  Twice the water was shut off hours longer than they anticipated, but office would  usually be closed by then, and voicemail full for after hours.  They change their security company every few months.  The 1st time I had them come for a service call, I gave no permission to enter, but technician still came in (after that I was skeptical to ask them to come fix anything).  Their parking policies make it difficult for guests to come and visit, and have to park far.  Would have been a better experience if it wasn't for the whole dryer situation.</review>

< Review>
Do not move into these apartments. I’ve had issues with my toilet and have to put in a service request multiple times per month. It takes a long time for maintenance to get to you, once it took almost 2 weeks. When I finally asked why the toilet continues to get clogged I was told that the pipes are just small and is just have to co th he calling them.

The afternight security never responds to my requests about the frequent loud noise at very later hours and when I made a formal complaint about my neighbors being extremely loud on weeknights very late at night, their continuous habit of smoking weed inside their apartment and the smell coming through my vents, and that they have actually banged on my kitchen window, it took 5 days for someone to contact me back and even when I was finally contacted by Andrew in the front office, I was basically told there was not much they could do and he honestly sounded like he didn’t care.

This place is too expensive to have to deal with issues like this. Save yourself the headache.</Review>

For the area and the assigned school district  this place is adequate. I have lived here for the past two years. There is many stray animals on the premises. Some neighbors tend to play their stereos loud outside on their patios especially on weekends. The new pools are extremely nice.  The apartments themselves are old and are falling apart slowly like a late model car that has too many miles. Management is trying to rehab the apartments but the process is slow. I never had any problems with my car being broken into here in the last two years. I highly recommend an upstairs apartment. The downstairs walls are low and can easily be jumped over. If you like having your windows open you will be constantly unsafe. Plus everyone can see into your apartment from the grounds, If you can afford nicer take it. If you can not rent here. Just take an upstairs apartment. Have patents because management has big plans but they move slowly. The new pools project started in mid-spring and lasted all summer. That was adding new bar-b-q's, rehab the bathroom, new liner on pool and spa, and new landscaping. That work lasted seven months. At that rate the new pool project will take years. I once heard this place described as "Shiny trash." I think that describes it well.< /text>

<Text>This place is terrible. Worse apartment we have lived in. At first everything seems nice and well maintained and then you move in and see how old it is and how they just keep covering things up. Our apartment was supposed to be the remodeled version.. well the kitchen and floors are remodeled but not the bathroom.. the bathroom has counters and cabinets from 1960 and they've just painted them 100 times over. There is mold in the bathroom. Our fridge leaks. There is missing paint above the front door. The sliding glass door leaks when it rains. We have water spots all over the ceiling. And every time we call?? They schedule an apt to come and then they NEVER come. It's a joke.
The people below us have consistently harrassed us. Complaining on us constantly for walking! It's just my fiancé, me and our dog! Which they allow pets btw.. We don't party or have people over.  We both work and are gone most the time.. And the people below us complain saying we walk loud and they can hear our dog running around. Well sorry you live downstairs we picked upstairs for that reason. The front doesn't stand up for us or tell them they are being over dramatic!
The people next to us SMOKE WEED all day everyday and make our apartment smell like weed. So much for being a non smoking community.
Plus no parking. Ever.
We are so unhappy that we are paying to break the lease.
Don't live here. All the bad reviews are so true.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The apartments are far over priced. The staff is not trained well and at times very unprofessional. I wouldn't suggest staying here to anyone. Most of the amenities they tell you about are unavailable and they give you same day notices when the water is off all day. I hope to break my lease asap. I suppose all of this is due to the new management they are in but I dislike it greatly.<//text>

<Review>I visited a friend here 7 times and each time there was a MAJOR issue w/his unit. The place looked great (indoor and outdoor pools & hot tubs, gas grills and fire pits, and even a small theater)...but none of that matters when the entire location is infested w/ROACHES and Bed Bugs!

Between that, the water being shut off once a month by the leasing office for "maintenance" (and the alert only comes a day in advance), and the homeless folks that are always around after hours, Corona Resort is NOT on point.

Maintenance often never shows up for scheduled appointments and even show up unscheduled due to the poor communication between their management and the leasing office staff.

None of the dryers work right (You'll  have to run them quite a long time), remodeled units frequently are done poorly, and they have the noisest leaf blowers alive (so don't expect much sleep past 9am if you have an afternoon or evening start to your day).

And the noise from the 91 freeway running along side it means you'll never have ☮️ and quiet...NEVER!!! People are always moving in and out as a result.

Do I need to mention more???

I am currently a resident here and the property has been under new management since fall of 2013. The 'heated' pool has not been heated for at least 2 years. When the new management took over they had grand plans for some pretty great upgrades/renovations.  They are currently in construction on 2 of the 4 pools here and have been for months with no real completion date in sight. When I resigned my lease in February of this year I asked about any future plans for new windows/sliding doors (they are REALLY old) and was told those were not a plan they had yet. A month later those started being replaced from street-view inward. I live near the back of the property. I also find it hard to believe a property this size took less than a month to plan and decide on the best bid for a project of that size and cost. They also repainted all the handrails (which wasn't really necessary). The speed bumps get repainted about once a month which causes driving congestion through the property. The maintenance crew park their golf carts anywhere they like and quite often drive them wherever and however they like. I have actually had one continue to drive head-on toward me and I had to move over and drive on the wrong side of the street to avoid a collision. The newest 'upgrade' is to change all the locks on residents doors that require some sort of special key that you yourself cannot duplicate so they are able to charge you a fee for additional keys. They will issue one for free to each person on the lease and that is all. Another resident here presented the office staff with safety upgrades that were actually needed (like bubble mirrors to eliminate blind spots in turns and a ramp for another handicapped resident) and they received a note on their door that stated they would not be allowed to sign another lease. They have to be out by the end of this month. When this resident questioned the office staff's decision they were told that they 'voted' out and that they are 'too big a headache'. The bubble mirrors are great and I actually feel safer with them there. Handicapped residents shouldn't have to fight for ramps. The law is they should be provided. All-in-all, if you are looking for something in this area you should look at Esplanade, Tuscan Townhomes, Paseo, or basically any place but here. The three I listed already have all the upgrades this place is trying to make with out the headache of a non-concerned office staff and management that bites off more than they can chew. Here's a tip, ONE PROJECT AT A TIME - FINISH - REPEAT.< /review>

<Review>I moved in a little over a year ago (2012).  I was hesitant to move here due to the other reviews, but they were years old.  I gave them a try.  I have had a pleasant experience living there.  It was quiet most of the time. Of course there were a couple of incidences where the noise was loud, but nothing alarming.  The property was clean and maintained well.  I called maintanence twice while I was there and they responded quickly and fixed the problems the same day.  The washers and dryers are wonderful!  beats going to the laundymat.  My car or apartment were never broken in to. The only dislike I have is they have electric stoves.  I prefer a gas stove.  Other than that I give this property a very likeable and high rating.< /Review>< GmapID>

My initial experience with the police further my sense of victimization and my initial interactions with the leasing office were not as satisfactory as I hoped given the magnitude on my well being and sense of safety at home - I felt like neither the Riverside PD nor the leasing office took the incidence as seriously as I did. *After several days, I had a second meeting with the Community Director and a representative from AMC (the management company), they addressed my concerned systematically and take steps to restore my sense of safety. The team at Corona Pointe, has shown that they do care about tenant concerns and are willing to adapt their approach to meet tenant needs. Although my experience this week has not been the best, it has been greatly improved by their commitment to professional and willingness to listen. These apartments have been a safe place for me for almost three years. I am reassured that even with the incidences of this week - the leasing office is commitment to providing a quality resident experience for all tenants.<//Review>< pictures>

I can't wait to move out. My air conditioner has been out for 5 days and counting and still haven't gotten it fixed. The "specialist" came days later because he's apparently the only one authorized to work with the gauges and when he did come he had supposidely fixed it two hours later it was broken down again, I've called them numerous times begging them to fix it but alll I get are promises that someone will be out to fix it and days have gone by. I've also been scared of a couple huge roaches popping up in my bathrooms (I have two). This place is completely overpriced for the service and the condition these apartments are do not waste your hard earned money here.</Text>

<gmap_id>0x80dcb76dec03bcbd:0x1501487876b352f7</gmap_id><review>This complex is trying very hard to turn itself into a luxury community, however, the residents of these apartments do not represent that of luxury living. I have been here almost a year, and they have made many improvements to the property with pools and keys and fencing and more, but all these upgrades won't do a bit of good when most of the residents here are social services recipients and living in the low socio economic status. My rental agreement is fairly priced for what I get, however, the rents have gone up since I signed my lease. When I come up for renewal, I don't think this will be a good deal.
If you are rarely home, and do not interact with your neighbors, this isn't a bad place. However, if you are looking for neighbors who don't look shady, and want to trust that FedEx can leave a package at your door without anyone taking it, this is not the community for you. In their defense, they are pouring TONS of money into this complex, trying to make it better, but it won't do any good so long the residents aren't turned over.<//review>< Rating>

<Review>No Insulation in the walls or windows. There would be drafts in every room and you were always having to pay to run the a/c or heater. Parking is horrible even though they have an "overflow parking area" it is in a bad spot and long walk. Couldn't count how many times I heard gunshots in the night. So many times would I watch from my balcony the police helicopter overhead with its beam shinning down. I believe over a dozen vehicles were broken into my 9 month lease. Maintenance staff was horrible. They would jimmy rig or half-way fix something. Office staff was amazingly rude and demeaning. Forget having outside furniture if you get a unit under a pine tree....they will drop sap and this yellow powder which ruins everything.  The carpet won't last and they will try to charge you for it if you have lived their under 2 years also the paint is eggshell which marks everywhere no matter what and they will charge you to re-paint if you have lived their under 2 years. I was always on edge with worrying about my vehicles being broken into. I was always worried about my wife being alone and walking from that overflow parking as there were always people who looked like criminals walking around. No gates so every morning and night homeless people would going through the garbage and I could hear them through my paper thin windows. Nothing in my unit was Energy Star so I payed an arm and a leg each month for electricity. The security company is a joke as it is one Hispanic man who doesn't even speak English, I tried telling him that one of the homeless guys had broken a window on a car and he didn't even care/understood...just said, "no comprende" and walked away. I hated every moment and could not wait to move away. Not a luxury apartment complex by far and way over priced.</Review>< pictures>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I live here and it is the most criminal apartment complex you can find. Crime rate is high, including vandlism, robbery, gangs hanging around, shady people, low class people...It's getting worse everyday.

Management is a mess! The manager is a jerk and no one at the office is ever able to give you answers when you need them. They don't even make you feel like they are on your side.

The towing company that is associated with the "Cortez Towing" are crooks and I'm sure the apartment complex gets paid for cars being towed away and very much encourage it.

In my case I got my car towed twice for unloading groceries in front of my house with hazard lights blinking!!! And two months after my car gets stolen and where the heck are they when it comes to responsibility?? They have done nothing to improve security yet they keep stealing everyone's money towing cars on a daily basis for the stupidest reasons! Yet they do NOTHING for you.

Service (work orders) take forever and always leave stuff half fixed!

DO NOT LIVE HERE!!!! Worth Reading My Experience!!
This place has horrible management, so unorganized,  they never showup to appointments , always lose info or documents, no parking, cars get broken into, useless security and matanence, you don't get your refund back.

They are terrible, we lived here for a year looks nice and new at first glance but once you start to live at this complex you see how bad it is. They are never around when they say they will be like there "24 hour emergency or security " no one picks up the phone it sends you to a voicemail then no one calls you back.

They never show up to scheduled appointments. Any time THEY schedule an apointment no one comes between the 5 hr gap they give. Everyone I've had to call the office and ask if someone is coming, then say they are sending someone now (which still doesn't come) I have to make numerous calls to get the appoint. completed.  They will also come weather your there or not if they want it to be scheduled it will be. We were unable to attend an appointment one time and of course they came then, I knew they had been inside because they left dirt trash and My Door Was Left UNLOCKED.

Matanence will hop your fence unannounced to work ok n the ac units and leave their trash and parts behind. No matter how much I called and asked to please be notified.

The water gets shut off constantly. They never give you enough notice it's on your door the Night before like 10pm or the day of.

They have numerous cases of cars getting broken into. This also happened to me. They only have cameras at the driveways enterance and a security car that occasionally drives around, this does nothing he is hardly there. No parking either if you own 2 cars.

They accused us of having pets. Gave us 2 notices that we would be charged, we kept telling them no pets and even let them checkout the apt. Come move out day when we had our inspection we asked before he left what would we be charged for he said he smells dog so carpet cleaning. Once again we said we didn't have a dog and they are taking out the carpet anyways. We were told after move in, at the carpet inspection and by the manager not to worry about the carpet because it will be taken out. He said I'll left the carpet now to check for stains. He ripped up the whole apt, there was 1 stain in the corner by the door, like a water damage stain. He said there you go lol what are you kidding. They took over half our deposit for pet damage and carpet cleaning. We fought it and had evidence , pictures,  recording of their manager saying we will get out deposit in full (since they don't do any paper trails) and they still said we were in the wrong and won't get it back. Ridiculous.

Bad communication with one another.  You could tell someone/ a manager in the office something and they either will call you then next day to re get the same info or will forget what you said once its brought back up, no one keeps info stored soomewhere.

It was such a hassle to live here.

< review>
I've lived here since June of 2016 and it's been an absolutely terrible experience, security has changed 5+ times since I've been here, my car has been vandalized and towed. I can't even get maintenance to service my apartment. Took 2 weeks for the leak in my sink to even be looked at, on top of that I've had multiple leaks, the appliances are outdated. The model they showed me looks nothing like the apartment I'm living in now. My dog ran away and yet I'm still having to pay rent for an animal I no longer have. The office does not do a good job with assisting, looks are deceiving here, I keep to myself and I would defineltly not recommend these apartments to any renters. You will be charged for anything and everything. I'm just counting the days until my lease is up at this point.</review>

The lease end date is always in writing on the Lease Agreement that each tenant signs before they move in to their apartment, and/or when a resident renews their lease.  We require a 30 day notice if a resident is breaking their lease, as well as a lease break fee.  However, because you moved out only one month prior to the end of your lease, we only required that you fulfill your contract and pay for the last month’s rent, which is less than the lease break fee.  The apartment has been rented, but is not yet occupied.  Once it is occupied, we will adjust your final payment owed, less the days in April that the apartment was occupied.\n\nIt is your responsibility to contact the U.S. Postal Service in order to get your mail forwarded to your new address.  This can be done at the post office, or through www.usps.com.  Our office cannot request this for our residents.  However, we can leave a note for the mail delivery person and advise them that you have moved and to please look into the forwarding address that you have filed.\n\nPlease contact us in the office if you have questions regarding your situation.

<pics>None< /pics><text>The management is a joke! They do not return phone calls I called 4-5 times and never got a response.  The girls in the office suck at their job and do not disclose all the information that they should to you and when you come back because your having an issue they swear up and down that they disclosed it to you and their managers back them up not giving you a fighting chance.  I hope that whoever lives here gets EVERYTHING IN WRITING!!! make sure you get a new lease if you lease again, make sure you know your exact move out (one thing they don't tell you is they dont count the month you move in even though you pay for it), also make sure you know that if you leave early there is a lease break fee.  side note if you move out early and they can find someone to rent your apt for the later half of the month make sure you follow up so you dont have to pay the entire month.  They try to get every penny from you.  I was there yesterday to get my mail (that they say they would forward to my forwarding address but of course the lazy ass people dont and it was still in the mailbox) and I overheard a guy asking how much he owed being quoted a price in the 900's the concierge gave him a price in the 1800's.  like i said if someone quotes you something here get it in writing with their name and signature because they will try to skrew you over when you come back!  I have been out a month now and i am still trying to get the manager to call me to settle stuff and i keep getting the run-a-round.

***So I called many times and they finally contacted me after giving them a bad review.  Also she tried to tell me that she reached out to me via my review.  News flash when i give a phone number to call me at it is very helpful to contact me directly not from a review that i do not look at daily for a response.  This is childish and something a teenager would do by not talking to me directly and trying to defend yourself publicly before contacting me directly.  Yes people read these and some take them very seriously some with a grain of salt.  But i am very disappointed in the management here.  I will give Robert KUDOS because he did try to help me.<//text>< user_id>

I have been living here for almost ten years. I have seen everything. the people in the office are really rude. the water gets shut off a lot. (if so many ppl call the office to complain about the water they lock the doors and don't answer the calls) ive seen cars get broken into. mine was stolen. the ppl in the condos right next to us ppl keep jumping that wall. hell my dad got a gun pointed at him at 4 am for his cigarette.  they need more then one security.  don't feel to safe here. rents so expensive or I would of had the extra money to move. there are a lot of ghetto ppl living here. ive almost got into a fight bc I woman almost hit me with her got got out and started yelling at me. I wouldn't move in here. every time someone is viewing a apartment and im driving by I tell then not a good idea. oh also HUGE problem is the parking if u get home around ten and u need to find parking ur better off sleeping in ur car or parking across the street and walking back</review>

They harass tenants and keep charging the rent multiple times and it takes forever and a lot of threats to file a lawsuit to get them to fix it. Stay away from this apartment community. I would move out if I wasn't really busy. It's not even a resort</text>

Very ghetto apartment building, Not a RESORT  At ALL.. The model I was shown looked horrible. The staff is very unprofessional in the office. I would Not recommend this place too anyone. Don't let a couple of nice pools fool you. Go elsewhere.</Review>

When my mom and I were the only people of color in the store, we received terrible service from multiple employees. They were offering drinks and dressing rooms to white customers, but entirely dismissed me and my mother. Don’t ever plan on shopping here again.< /Review>

Awesome place! Getting your guard card is super easy & beneficial! They have all types of courses you can take & they get done in 1 day. Highly recommend if anyone is going for security or wants to get any certification of a guard card or any other permit, come to this place!< /review>

For years this place has deliver the best guards know to LA empire area / south coast to central coast and now  this guards that move for personal reasons still come and Renew/ finish and or continue there training with of the best instructors .. also people need to understand this is time consuming so come prepare and with time and ready to learn not to rush..
a lot of guard that attended this academy for years I now some of them now are sheriff’s and or many fields of law enforcement including 911 dispatch and they still work part time Security officers ..  I highly recommend and continue to do Business with them .<//review>

Got my Baton and Pepper Spray permits here on the same day as training.  They stock up on BSIS cards so you don't have to wait for them. That was great because I needed the licenses right away.  Both costs $185 and they also include the extended baton permit/training.  Guaranteed good place to get training.</Text>

< review>
La Terraza is a great community. Quiet and well maintained grounds. However, the trash near 491 is continuously being targeted by dumpers and junk piles up. I think that it is beginning to smell and is attracting rodents. This has been an issue for a while. And residents have reported this too. I think that a fence and additional dumpster need to be added to that area. One dumpster is not enough. Also, security patrols for dumping would be recommended.

But again, I love my apartment. Great community.<//review>

<text>Been here for about 5 years.  The walls are thick (or thicker than other places). space is large, and it falls into rent control.  But the best thing, hands down, is the staff.  They are always quick to help out, always working on the property, and always professional and courteous.  Special Shout Out to James, who I feel gives special attention to every resident!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>So far, only after a few weeks, our experience has been bad. We were looking for an apartment with a covered parking spot, and I emphasized the parking request several times. AFTER we moved in, we were informed that all of the covered spots are occupied and we are assigned an open parking. I contacted the management several times, and no solution for the situation yet. I will keep updating this review.</text>< pics>

<review>This is the most unreasonable and guests unfriendly community that I’ve ever been to. All guest parking in the community requires a permit which residents need to buy and you have to pay extra to get another if you lost your original one. Your car will be towed immediately if they found out you park without a permit. No warning or grace period will be given. Nights and weekends no difference. Is the property owner sharing profit with the towing company or something? Worth investigation:)< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Stay away from here. Staff is not ready and not knowledgeable to resolve any of your issues. One time they come with one information, and then they change it making you believe you understood it wrongly first time. Identification of the buildings is horrible leading the many many mail errors, and taking long for guests to find your door. Cancellation condition is unreal, manager is rude. I don't believe this review will do anything because I think they don't care, but at least I'd like to get my voice heard.</Text>

The first day we moved in to this apartment , we found lots of bugs INSIDE the fridge.  they replace that fridge with an other Temporary one which was broken , it wa missing shelves with some other broken parts .  But now after 3 month  living at this residence,  we still have the same broken fridge . Paying over 3k amonth and the land lord can not afford to replace a $300 fridge . It's so disappointing and I do not reccomend this community to anyone.

I really like these townhouse apartment homes. I used to live in a house and have to transition to an apartment. This was the way to go. You can't find good apartment homes ones with a 2 car tandem garage and a large kitchen, spacious rooms. The pool by the leasing office is great. Leasing office ladies are so nice. I don't know why people are upset. They have been nothing but welcoming and accommodating to me since I moved in. Also, there is a nice little dog park to take my dogs. This complex is very pet friendly. Sure, parking is a tight but which apartment isn't? If you have guests, just go to the leasing office to get a permit for them. There are plenty of spots available for guests, they just have to walk a bit further. If they can't find a spot, they can try to find it off of Kiely. The complex is nicely located between Harker School and a Marriott hotel. Across the street is a shopping center with an asian market, some bakeries, restaurants and Starbucks as well as a Burger King. 7-11 is close by. It's close to the freeway and easy to get in and out of the complex while on Saratoga and also back of the complex. I don't mind living here for a while until I buy a home again. If you are looking for a transition from house to apartment, this is it. Also.. families all over the place. It's wonderful. I have 2 small children and I can say, they love it here.< /review>

have an ongoing pest issue since initially reporting in August 2018. Rats or squirrels are nesting between the timber framing to the exterior wall and ceiling of the second-floor hallway leading to the bedroom and bathroom on the second floor in the apartment. I fear there is serious structural damage going on because the sprinkler piping in the hallway for the second-floor bedroom and bathroom has shifted. I have asked multiple time both online and in person to management to send qualified personnel to deal with these pests promptly.  no response so far</Text>

I parked my car at 1 am, to meet my friend and they towed my car at 1:08 am. Ridiculous apartments. No notice anywhere visible that its permit parking. Had to pay 420$ for the irresponsible management. Why don’t you change the curb of color or paint its permit parking. Never visit or live there .</Review>

<text>If I could give this a 0 rating I would! First off, we had an insane amount of issues with cockroaches, not just in our apartment but in the building in general (after speaking to other neighbors). We contacted the management team multiple times about this issue and their first response was telling us to plug up our drain holes so the roaches can't come in through the drain pipes. Well that didn't work. Their next solution was to offer to spray inside our apartment with pesticides. I told them I was not comfortable with them doing that because we have 2 dogs and I don't want chemicals in our apartment that could potentially harm them. She assured us that the chemicals were pet safe but I still refused. She then explained that they will spray more regularly around the building to help with the problem and to let them know in a few weeks if that works. Well, what do you know, less than a month after that conversation La Terraza almost KILLED my 11 year old golden retriever from the amount of chemicals they were spraying around the complex in the "dog friendly" areas for bugs. We had to rush our dog to the vet and pay after hours fees for our dogs stomach to be pumped with charcoal to save him from the toxic chemicals that La Terraza was spraying outside weekly. When we confronted the property manager (who no longer works there - because she was probably let go for how rude and terrible she was) she claimed that she never told us the pesticides were pet friendly because she doesn't know if they are or not. First of all, if you are the manager of a property, you better know everything about what is going on around the complex (including what pesticides are being used)! 2nd of all, why would they not use pet friendly/safe pesticides when this is a pet "friendly" complex where I even pet pet rent at?! Absolutely ridiculous! And what's more, is Alicia was a liar!!!! She claimed previously that the pesticides were pet safe and then later stated she would never say that because she didn't know what chemicals they were using!! How extremely irresponsible!! We then tried to take La Terraza to smalls claims and just found out that we lost, unfairly in my opinion. Maybe my next step will be a class action law suit, who knows!

In addition to that nonsense, someone backed into my car and never left a note so my front hood is dented and the walls are as thick as paper. Can literally hear anything that our upstairs neighbors do and even people talking outside who are walking by (and I mean people just having a conversation, not yelling or fighting). We also had many packages stolen of our front porch and both of our bikes which were locked up were stolen from our porch as well (no help from management regarding any of these issues at all).

DON'T LIVE HERE IF YOU CAN AVOID IT! You will immediately regret it!!</text>< pictures>

<text>Pros:
- The townhouse apartments are nice and fairly new.
- It has convenient freeway access.
- The maintenance staff is friendly and responsive.

Cons:
- Security is weak, there have been numerous mailbox break-ins in the last two years. They took a long time to fix the the mailboxes and have not provided any extra security other than somewhat stronger mailboxes.
- Mercenary parking policy, they changed all visitor parking spaces to leased spaces. There is no place for visitors to park.
- The USPS mail carrier who services the complex is inept and delivery services have a hard time with the confusing addressing. I think about a quarter of packages delivered to me don't make it.
- They replaced all the lightbulbs in the kitchen with cheap fluorescent bulbs that take a long time to warm up to the point where they actually provide light.
- The staff is often defensive when presented with a problem - the manager is often surly.
- They raise rates at the drop of a hat.< /text>< Pics>

I would like to give -999 star if I can. Writing this review right now in front of the leasing office. Visited two times along with two kids with appointment for tour leasing office folks sent us back without even proper response. Extremely disappointed. La Terra leasing folks, you are not doing us favour we are here to pay and live in the community.< /Review>

Horrible Experience. We were looking at this place because its very convenient and close to family. Went in a filled out an application the same day and provided everything they needed by the next day. Griffin was very slow at responding to us and didn't keep us updated until I called. Our estimated move in date was the 20th but until the 23rd we didn't hear anything. We asked for our holding deposit back since over the weekend we went to other apartment and got it the next day. Our holding deposit didn't come back until the 23 of the next month. Management company sucks, they really need to improve on their productivity. Also when Griffin was showing the apartment he was very nice and friendly after telling him that we didn't have a paycheck stub like normal working people since our income is from two rentals that we have, his attitude changed, JUDGMENTAL!</Review>

Cockraoches. Then leasing office called in exterminators, yet we still found more cockroaches after the "pest control."

Uninhabitable.< /Review>

The people are nice and the place is fine, but I’ve had FOUR incidents where I go through the drive thru and use the excellent McDonald’s app to get my $1.00 coffee before work. Their computers don’t recognize the code. 4 times in the drive thru when I’m running lately usually and really need my coffee.

So they told me to come inside and amazingly their front computers take the code! Doesn’t make sense, it’s a hassle and takes up time, but I do it and it works. Until today. Now the code and their app won’t work inside or out.

So, now I have to be the bad guy and feel like I’m creating a scene just to explain the situation and the history.

Just fix the issue McDonald’s. Tell someone in Corporate or someone - PLEASE.< /text>

I didn't even get 2 BBQ sauces to begin with. So yea I paid for 2 sauces. Unbelievable. They say they put them in there I peek I dont see them so when I ask for 2 more just in case they aren't there I have backup. When it came to eating guess what they aren't there only the 2 I PAID for that I wasn't supposed to.< /Text>

<text>The young lady at the counter was having a difficult time hearing several customers. She seemed a bit agitated when the masks prevented both she and the customer from hearing one another. Large coffee to go was fine. Nice and hot. The restroom was being attended properly. No complaints!</text>< resp>

The service was good and the food was OKAY.  I ordered 3 pieces of  chicken and fries; it was OK, but the chicken was very SALTY.  I would not order the chicken again. The price for what I  ordered was a little high for what I received.

Their BATHROOM was kept very CLEAN.<//Review>

Went through drive through had to ask several times for the screen to be displayed with menu choices. Kept hearing May I take your order. How was I to do so if there's a blank screen. Then I was asked to park in reserved for orders. Though the young lady (employee)was very nice but why didn't I receive napkins?? Was given additional straws which I didn't ask for. How was I to wipe my mouth and hands. Was an experience I never had. Normally, don't eat fast food. I recommend this location and will probably return. I love their sweet tea with no ice. 😋 fries are good too. 😊< /text>

Denver airport - worst QPounder ever. Since they now prepare them fresh to order, I expect better than stale bun and cold patty.
But you can't fault the French fries< /Review>

<Review>Usually crowded and dirty just a bit, also a lot of homeless people and random cursing people. Also it's always cluttered at the entrance. Food is good, served at average pace. Employees don't seem to care much and a lot of them have no sense of humor or passion for compliments, etc.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2b76640d5e567:0xc912c3212db7dc16</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Managers and staff are not very professional; it's very loud they cannot hear the orders, nor are they and security friendly to the #transients that frequent there... Some transients permanently wait at the drive through area, before and after the cashier window... So when mentioned to the cashier, they shrug and say well, police will come by and they come back.  I have a problem with that casual attitude, you are on the clock so then behave appropriately. I prefer to buy someone food than give money, but that is my choice. Not always do I carry extra for purchasing more than a meal deal...</review>

It’s a McDonald’s. There isn‘t anything special about this location. It was clean inside, and the food I ordered was correct. I recommend using the McDonald’s kiosk to minimize the risk of getting your order wrong.< /review>

<review>McDonalds YUCK! This review only popped up because I ran in to use the restroom and my location tracks EVERY where I go! As far as I'm concern McDonalds is nasty. To be honest none of these fast food chains are good for you at all! All these restaurants are totally unhealthy with unhealthy processed foods YUCK!!!
At least now you know how I feel about fast food chains 🤷🏾‍♀️<//review></record>

The service is bad at this McDonald's. Management it's not engaged with quality control and so the crew is all just going through the motions. It's slow, there's often a long line because the crew is so inefficient and orders are often wrong. The worst of all nobody gives a hoot. Nobody at this McDonald's cares about doing a good job or providing excellent customer service we're paying attention to detail.< /text>

Ms. Elvira was the cashier. The restroom was clean. The utensils were sealed in plastic . There was a repair individual who was keeping the machinery in working condition. There were several reasonable selections. (Unedited. Charles Johnston)</text>

this is the best McDonald's I've been to.
Update: 9/2020. This is still my favorite mcdonalds. I pass 4 mcdonald's when driving from work just to eat here. French fries and reg hamburger is all I get, but better than any other mcdonalds where fries are not fresh. The food is always fresh. Staff is very nice. Place is clean!< /Review>

Pro: the food is usually done like you would expect with friendly staff.

Con: slow service. On this day (today) it took a full 12 minutes from the time my receipt printed out at 1129 am,  until I received my meal  at 1141. Now add in time spent waiting in line and placing my order.  That is a bit on the long side if you ask me.</Text>

Poor management. Poor ownership. too bad it was my favorite Mc but it is what it is..They asked me to park, and it took the 20 minutes to get my food ot it is not the first time or second..no ketchup no napkins no straws..no team work no customer service no more my business for you.. no worries I am only one. Social media is my voice.. feel bad if it happens to you.😔😔</text>

<review>This place was a typical McDonald's experience. I got my egg McMuffin and scrambled eggs fairly quickly. I ordered at the counter and it was worried that the 10 internet orders were going to take precedent. I took a seat in the restaurant and my food was delivered pretty quickly. this is the second McDonald's restaurant that I have gone to where the food is delivered to your table. it seems that McDonald's has decided that there is too much congestion in the area around the cashiers. It's nice just to be able to sit and wait for your food at your table.< /review>< pics>

It's Mc Donalds the menue has gotten too complicated all I want is a good ol fashion burger and hot.crispy fries and a Coke. Speaking of  Coke  one dollar for any size soft drink. Good ideal the Jack and the King should take a lesson on their overpriced soft drinks. They need to bring back that Burger with lettuce, tomato and cheese with catchup and mustard. I think they called the Big and Fresh that was a burger.< /text>

<Review>Went through the drive-thru, I was asked to park and wait for my order. I sat in a got car for nearly 20 minutes. I want inside, my order had just been filled. That is one of the oldest lies in the book. And I told the so-called manager that. The McDonald's wasn't busy, which made me even more 😡. The fast-thru wasn't fast. It was her it when I'm ready.< /Review><response>None< /response>< rating>

Everyone for the most part is courteous. Ive been going to this McDonalds for over a year now mainly when I get off from work. The french fries are usually hot and food as well. This is by far my favorite McDonalds and I hope it remains that way.< /review>

This local can get pretty messy and service can get pretty bad depending on time of day. But it has a play place so it's a good place to take your kids or to get a quick bite to eat.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><Text>I love McDonald's, but every now and then there is a knuckle head that ruins the whole Mickey Dee's experience. In this case it would be Jocelyn. I believe she is a manager how I have no clue, she must have pictures of the franchise owner performing naughty acts with Grimace and the Hamburgler. On a scale of 1-10, ten being fully competent and 1 being the least competent, she is well in the negatives. A complete lack of common sense will have this person earning minimum wage for the foreseeable future. If you decide to come here you will not  be disappointed with the delicious food, but in the event you will need to speak with a manager and you get stuck with Jocelyn, may God help you.   Okay I am done with my little rant, I still love McDonald's, just not this one!< /Text>< Pics>

Update : 1/29/19 12:20am. Sweet tea is again watery and girl at drive thru Is always rude , and looks like she's annoyed. And tell me why she alllllllllwaaaaaayyssssss forget my straw for my drink EACH TIME ! lol its getting ridiculous, I wonder how many people left with no straws .smh. She handed me my bag and walked allllllll the way off thru the door in the back and I'm sitting there like uhhhhhh... Smh atleast fries were hot.  just the fries no customer service or good beverages.  ,

If you enjoy drinking SWEET TEAS do not purchase them at this location, cause it will be extremely watery, they will give u a cup of ice water or it will just be tea flavor no sweetness at all. I'm done giving them chances for sweet teas too many disappointments.< /Text>

Yesterday was my 3rd bad experience within  6 months at this store.  Each time I stay away a while to give them a chance to change the situation gets worst like the greasy Bac/Egg/Cheese Biscuit sand I couldn't finish eating after it upset my stomach; I think was cooked in old grease too close to some other food.< /text>

The people working here are friendly, but sometimes they forget to add condiments, which I find frustrating. It's a busy place so sometimes the drive thru line is long. Keep going back because mainly due to the convenience factor: it's the nearest place to my house I can grab a quick meal.</Text>

Great place but the attendant at the drivethru should cultivate the act of patient while she deal with customer for the purpose of the corporation she is working for. I can hear her murmuring as she lsment how i was a confused being. 8/7/2017 11:35am</review>

Great place but the attendant at the drivethru should cultivate the act of patient while she deal with customer for the purpose of the corporation she is working for. I can hear her murmuring as she lsment how i was a confused being. 8/7/2017 11:35am</text>

It's so unorganized, no one knows what they're doing.. We put our order in, they read the order back.. When we got home we were missing two of the kids orders.. Don't understand if they call your number, that means their handing you "YOUR COMPLETE ORDER" Or do they know how to read.?< /review>

Came during lunch. Drive thru was backed up like crazy. So I walked in, line was to the door so I asked the manager to open another line and he just looked at me and walked away. SMH I'm so cool. All I wanted was a sweet tea. 12:25 10/14< /text>

<text>I had a horrible experience at McDonald's on Slauson near Fairfax in Ladera Heights. I ordered a McRib sandwich today, and I took a couple bites and swallow. i realize something wasn't right.  I looked at it. realize it was a bunch of blonde hair in my food a lot of long blonde hair!!  I went back inside McDonald's and talk to management. I look in the kitchen area and seeing the lady making the sandwiches and she had a lot of blonde streaks in her hair I'm sure she was the one who made my sandwich. wow it's hard to believe that all of that hair fell in between the sandwich.< /text>< Response>

The only reason why I rate this McDonald’s at 3 is the fact that the drive thru wait times are ridiculous. Even though they have 2 speaker to order from it just takes forever. I ordered a coffee drink from here and they didn’t even offer me a straw. The parking lot can be full at times.</Text>

My coffee is alway delish and my order is always correct. I'm giving it three stars because of the drive thru times (you can be trapped there for 20 minutes waiting on your food) and because of the small lobby, it gets congested quickly of more than 4 people are in the building waiting to place an order.<//review></record>

(Translated by Google) I had to leave the restaurant, because there is very bad service I was waiting for 10 minutes and I was not attended to the cashier was talking, the manager and the more employees talking and laughing looked at me and ignored me, and still waiting people, and if the manager or is able to take responsibility in the business he does there, but good bad, bad everything.
