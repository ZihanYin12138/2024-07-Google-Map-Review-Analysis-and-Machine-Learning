The people that work here are very unprofessional. I felt very rushed and pressured while shopping, I did not feel welcomed. After spending almost 200$ I later returned 2 of the items, I was charged a “15% restocking fee”. I will never shop here again.</text>

<Text>Just bought a new 2017 black mustang.  Googled how to wash a black car and took me to the chemical guys youtube videos.  This store has all you need to keep your car looking like new.  I highly recommend getting the foam blaster.  Also sign up for their news letters.  You get emails with special discounts.<//Text>< Pics>

Decent products, but some of their accessories are overpriced.  Staff can be knowledgeable, but they are more anxious to sell things than they are to listen.  Many of their products are nearly identical to each other.< /text>

Great products, very helpful staff.

Only suggestion is the locations owner add Chemical Guys as a key search word to allow Google to identify this as a Chemical Guys retail location.

Search Google maps for Chemical Guys and you get Gardena and Santa Ana only.

Noticed Wal-Mart is now selling Chemical Guys. Really hope this doesn't impact sales at this franchise.

Gotta admit what I believed to be a premium product had lost a little of its appeal knowing that these great products are now available at Wal-Mart.

Seriously screwing over the franchisees.< /review>

I love this spot! They offer good food, they have a nice menu, The chief cook in that place is very experienced, I like very much tasting all their dishes. The dishes are consistently of high class, the attitude towards the customers  is nice. I  go often to this place and I not even once was unsatisfied. I recommend it to all my friends.< /review>

Pizza is good, the location appears a little run down. I like to call ahead and pick up, but even waiting for my order is uncomfortable because of the condition of the interior. The food is good but I would only consider for takeout or delivery.</text>

Haven't been to a Round Table in years but glad I stopped in here. I was immediately impressed with the cleanliness of the place and the fun decor. I look forward to bringing the family when things open up. Regarding the pizza....I thought it was an excellent value with great crust and toppings! What a pleasant surprise!

I don’t like leaving bad reviews. I really like Round Table Pizza, but there are issues nearly ever time I order from them. One time I placed a pick up order online and they didn’t even know about the Order when I arrived, then didn’t know how to refund me when I wanted to cancel. There have been 3 or 4 other frustrations that occurred also. I hope they read this and feel motivated to try to run things better.</text>

Worst customer service. 2hrs 45 mins before we canceled our order. I was told we didn't even order from this store until we provided the order number. I understand that times can vary, the online order said 1hr 15 mins. We waited an hour and half after that before canceling the order. The person on the phone was rude and told us we didn't even order from their location.  When pressed he hung up on me and I had to call back in and provide an order number before he looked up the order.. Your $50 pizzas are not good enough to justify an almost 3 hr wait time Round Table. You can do better than this. Now I have to find a local pizza spot because I can't see myself ever coming back to Round Table.

Do not ever order from this location! If they say it will be an hour, it’ll 2. By the time you get your food, regardless of whether it is pickup or delivery- it’s going to be cold. We live near by so we’ve tried them a dozen times, assuming we’ve just gotten unlucky but we’re DONE.< /Text>

I’ve been coming here for years  and usually good service.  Ordered for take-out and girl on the phone hung up on me before I could get the entire order out . Then when I called back she put me on hold for 10 minutes. When she finally came back I said I was trying to tell you that I wanted deep dish crust and she said,” sorry you should have said something earlier”. As soon as I opened my mouth to explain that I was still ordering when she hung up on me before she hung up on me again. Won’t be going back< /Review>

Though the pizza here was as tasty as any other Round Table I've eaten at, I find that, for what we had it was overpriced - please read on and you'll see why. Let me preface this with the fact we had just come from settling my elderly father in after having had surgery so we were mentally exhausted. We asked for specials and were told there was only one for a discount on an extra large pizza. There being just two of us that wouldn't work. We ordered a medium pepperoni for $18.00 only to see a window sticker as we sat down for a large pepperoni for $16.00!  What gives?!?!  We asked for the specials and the person clearly knew what type of pizza we wanted so why not tell us about this deal?  A few extra slices to bring home is worth paying less for the next size up.  One last complaint - when I asked for a box for our leftover pizza I was sent clear to the back of the store to pick up my own box. I've NEVER had to do that anywhere else and it felt very unsavory.  It will be a very long time before I go here again simply for the fact their customer service, in my opinion, was non-existent.<//text>

Far below the Round Table standard.

Ugh!! Phone order service is terrible. Used to like, but lately declining. Today was last straw. Ordered at 125 on a Fri afternoon, still no pizza at 245. I was told the pizza was still there, just no driver to deliver it. Remedy offered was either... get this.. wait longer or cancel the order. Asked for manager, and was passed to another employee. Then asked for manager again, left on holdddddd... No call back, but at 330 a driver shows up.

What would you do? Pay $35 for a guaranteed cold pizza or go hungry 2 hours later? Expect that to be your choice when you order.< /text>

My neighborhood roundtable.  I think it's great.  I can't count the number of baseball, soccer, scout meetings and parties I've been here for.  The kids love the games (board and video). If I am being objective, it's pretty average but no one says I have to be objective.  A banjo club meets here and you can listen to them if your lucky to be here their meeting night.</Text>

<Rating>4<//Rating><text>I love round table, huge fan, and we hold a lot of finding at this location. It is pretty clean, but the employees seem high most of the time and struggle to fill orders correctly. I normally wouldn't say something so inflammatory but I saw one smoking weed in the parking lot-they are all very pleasant and once you realize that their laid back attitude has more to do with substances than anything else it makes it a much cozier vibe. I'm kidding, your employees are high and messing up your business.<//text>< Pics>

Usually super busy on fridays due to loud parents and loud kids after school sports games, but they keep the service up very well during those nights. Food is always great and never takes long.</Review>

Just finished my salad and two slices of King Arthur Supreme, from the buffet option. The crust was crisp, veggies and meats were fresh, and the pizza was not over topped. The salad bar was fresh. Yum!</Text>

<text>Good pizza. The taste and quality is pretty much average for me and the service here was mediocre. Honestly, I have been to a lot of pizza joints and there were a few that had really good pizza. Maybe I'm just picky but this is just my opinion.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

This R.t.P. is known for turning out its great food and full buffets. It happens to b the most local one around area; litterally theres generations of my family which have been coming here-  at least 3 decades of delicious unbeatable round table quality pizza! This r.t.p has remodeled wnd added an additional  gaming area for kid but still offers the family atmosphere with a really awesome group of employees.</text>

I attempted to order a pizza, over the phone, and after I was greeted I was promptly put on hold. Typically this ok however I was on hold for over nine minutes. It seems odd to me that they (Roundtable Oak Park) have an average product and below average service. Ill go somewhere else for an average pizza.< /Text>

3/10/15

I've been coming to this RT since my sister and I were little kids. We used to play on the Simpsons arcade machine at the front of the place before they remodeled it years ago. When my sister died unexpectedly a couple of weeks ago, my co-workers helped out my family by bringing homemade dinner to my parents and family every night of the week. The night before the funeral they ordered a Large and X-Large pizza for delivery to my parent's home, a mile away from this location. A special request to make heart-shaped pizza was included on the online order, and the pizzas were customized to end up with one meat and one veggie.

I received a call around 5 pm from RT - I had nothing to do with the ordering, as I'd been with my family all day handling funeral prep. They let me know that they weren't currently making the heart-shaped pizzas, and that pizza would arrive in about 40 minutes. However, it had been requested by the office that the pizzas be delivered at 6:40, so at 5:40 I was home wondering where the pizza was. I called RT back around 6 and asked what was going on - I was told that the person on the phone hadn't looked at the entire order, so I'd been waiting around for nothing. Everyone was really happy when the doorbell rang at 6:40.

My husband asked the driver if he'd already been tipped. He replied "well, sort of". We looked at the receipt. He received $5 to drive ONE MILE. It's a yes or no question. Sort of? What? Do you need more money for a 2 pizza delivery or are you just trying to trick a grieving family? We THEN saw that it was $98 (yes, NINETY EIGHT US DOLLARS) for the 2 pizzas. I called the manager, insisting there must be some mistake. But I was told by the supervisor on duty that customized pizzas are pretty expensive. I asked if there was anything she could do - these weren't very special pizzas. And their L/XL aren't very big. NOPE. That was it.

The girl in my office meant well by ordering something we'd like, but should have started with a veggie pizza and added toppings, rather than taking off and customizing, etc. Also, she thought she was getting heart-shaped pizza. Her heart was in the right place; and Round Table has no heart. They are just another greedy restaurant chain who lost someone as a customer who had so many fond memories after being a loyal fan for decades.< /Review>

<text>Nice looking shop. My son ccame from Idaho. He was a mess. He wanted a straight razor shave. I am getting married and he is in the wedding. The lady was very nice but did not do the straight shave. She flat out ignored our request and hurried through checking her watch every 2 min. Did not get what we wanted! Ma'am, it was the experience of the shave. I don't care if you thought it was better to use an electric razor. Not your choice!! If You did not have time then say so. Not going back.<//text><GmapID>0x809054bdc3766c0b:0xe816d67fc53bd20< /GmapID></record>

The workers were not even working. Constantly on their phones, going to the other employees work space. Completely unprofessional. They only have one worker who knows how to cut hair. It's always a hit and miss if and when you get a haircut. Would not recommend this place at all.</review>

They offer a pretty good hair cut at a decent price I would recommend making an appointment unless you have some time to kill. The staff is friendly and the inside of the shop is a pretty chill environment with pretty good music playing usually.<//text>

This place is a piece of crap. I called to make an appointment and the person answered was very unprofessional. Plus I had to call back a second time due to them hanging up the first time. Its by appointments only even if they're not busy I mean empty customers. The workers had to write these reviews because they're not that good<//Text>

Dr Wong is the most thorough chiropractor I have been too! I appreciate the time he took to understand my personal situation and not just lump me in with the usual back crackin group! He isn't stuffy either! Yay!<//text>

That was the best adjustment I have ever had!  I’ve been going to a chiropractor since I was a baby and have been adjusted by many different chiropractors over my 44 years.  Plus I worked as a chiropractor myself for 16 years and this was the best adjustment.  I felt safe and at ease while getting adjusted.  The adjustment felt very precise and effective.  I definitely felt like the power was turned on and my inner healer activated.  I felt like I experienced true healthcare.  Thank you!< /text>

I retired 2 months ago due to my right shoulder muscles being strained and me not wantng to take the chance of further straining then to the point of needing surgery. I've enjoyed 66 years of playing. The last 15 of which is mainly due to his expertise.</Review>< pictures>

This was my third chiropractor to try and they say, "third time is a charm". Dr. Wong and team could not have been any better. The most professional, attentive and knowledgeable Dr. I've been to. I drove an hour and fifteen minutes twice a week for four months for my appointments, that should say it all. I highly recommend them.< /text>

That was in March of 2015. Dr. Wong got me feeling back to normal within a few months of seeing him once a week. He is great at what he does, which is heal and educate. There are also massage therapy services at the location, which was great because the fact that it’s at a Dr.’s office made massages eligible for coverage by my insurance. If you do get a massage there, ask for Matt.

I’ve continued to visit Greater Life for an adjustment once a month to ensure that my body alignment stays optimized. The facilities are easily accessible (you can park in the back if you have difficulty walking up stairs), it is clean and the staff is all very friendly.

They offer tea and water to enjoy as well as fruit if you’re hungry and want an apple or banana to snack on.

They also have a therapy room set up with different chiropractic therapy exercise stations set up for you to do your own physical therapy before or after your appointment. If you are a patient, then you can actually go in at any time if you want to work on whatever issues you may have.

If you want personal attention, a comfortable environment, a highly knowledgeable Dr., friendly staff, and most importantly to heal yourself and stay healthy, Greater Life Wellness Center is the spot.</review><name>Athan Anas</name><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

In your brother's case, he needed an examination and x-rays so that we could accurately find out what was causing his extreme neck pain. This was explained to your family member and he agreed to the cost of $59.  Although chiropractic is extremely safe, there are instances where a person can be worse off if the condition is not diagnosed and treated properly.\n\nAfter we reviewed his x-rays, we went over his condition and gave our recommendations. We told him how much an adjustment would be but for some reason, he declined. We did not refuse to help. We do not include an adjustment with our assessment until we can find out what the problem is and if we can help.\n\nUnfortunately, we did not get to discuss any of the cost-saving options as he didn't want to move forward with the first adjustment. It was definitely not $6,000 as you mentioned.\n\nAgain, we are sorry that your family member was in a lot of pain. We always do our best to diagnose the problem before any service is rendered.\n\nWe have issued a refund to your family member to show that we acted in his best interest. We wish you the best and we hope that your family member receives the relief that they were looking for.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Wong & Staff"}</Response>

<gmapID>0x80deaaf9c065e91b:0x2394ef1a3ab75011<//gmapID><review>A family member of mine was in a lot of pain in their neck, so we suggested they see a chiropractor. Mr Wong’s website suggested “free exams” this was great until they showed up and did the X-rays. Said to come back in the late afternoon for next steps.

Well, $59 and several painful hours later that, we show up and he makes them watch a chiropractor advertisement, suggesting the benefits of a chiropractor and then explains the cost of $6,000 “treatment plan” for 3-4 months. Then when we suggested only treating this single issue in the neck he refused and told them to “have a good day”.

If you are looking for a Chiropractor who cares about their patients and is actually interested in treating them, I suggest you stay away from Dr Wong’s office and the entire team at “Greater Life Family Chiropractic” what a SHAM.</review>< Pics>

Between crashing my motorcycle, golfing, and falling off my long board, my skeleton is all out of wack. Dr. Wong fixed me right up and every customer I saw was so happy and satisfied. Their care, hospitality, and concern for your particular problem is next level. The best chiro I've seen in decades.<//review>

I came to Dr. Wong thinking I was fine occasional pain but no big deal but my husband could use some adjustments so we went in together... Boy, was I wrong my husband was fine and I had several issues from minor car accidents over the years. Dr. Wong did a full evaluation and scan to show and explain what was happening and what we could do to not only to prevent further damage but to correct the damage that was done over the years. I must say I've never felt better. I have more energy, no back or neck pain, no headaches anymore and they're a fabulous bunch of professionals. The evening classes are great TOO!!! They also provide massages and everyone needs a massage now and again:-) If you have any sort of issue or even if you don't come get a full evaluation you never know whats happening in your spine. Don't waste another minute make an appointment with Dr. Wong today.</Review>< Pics>

<time>1561398333851<//time><rating>1<//rating><Text>Called this place to make an appointment and was told there is a $69 fee for an assessment on the first visit, then a consultation and adjustment on the second visit. I went in and had my assessment. They played me a 7 minute video detailing how great Chiropractics is and all the benefits. Then a someone walks in who is not Dr. Wong. Dr. Wong is the only doctor listed on their website and the only doctor mentioned in the office so I was confused. His name was Dr. Heeder. He weighed me and did some x-rays then charged me $69 and sent me home. I return the next day for my second visit. Dr. Wong saw me and told me the results of their findings. He handed me a contract for 4 months of treatment for $2,815. No option to pay per adjustment...you have to sign the contract and pay that amount either all at once or through a payment plan. I expressed that I was not interested in signing a contract until I was treated and adjusted first so I could see if I wanted to continue with treatment or not. He began his hard sell to convince me that it is a long term process and that I need to be committed in order to solve my back pain problems. I asked if I could just be adjusted and then I would think about it and let him know. He was not happy with this response. He wanted me to sign the contract before he treated me. He told me my problems would need more than one visit. I said that I understand however I'm not committing to $2,800 treatment plan without even seeing if I like the service. That is when he told me he would only do a one time adjustment if I paid an additional $75. I told him that was not what I was told on the phone and he again said that was the only way he would treat me that day. So I left the office having received no treatment whatsoever after two visits and paid $69 to receive a bunch of useless information and a sales pitch. I drove straight to The Joint down the street on Rosecrans and was adjusted within minutes by a great Doctor and only paid $29. Save your time and avoid this place. It's like walking into a timeshare sales office or used car dealership.< /Text>< Pics>

I apologize that I was busy and could not see you on the first day you came in and that's why Dr. Heeder saw you instead.\n\nWe understand that going through a full examination of your spine along with diagnostic images can be a bit overwhelming especially for someone who has never seen a Chiropractor before. However, we pride ourselves on our thoroughness. Considering the extent and history of a person's injuries and complaints, a thorough evaluation is always done to diagnose your condition properly. We understand that you did not like the financial options and plan recommendations. There are offices that do quick fixes and patch up work without taking x-rays but that's not what we do. Our office has specific scientific techniques and we focus on corrective care rather than simply symptomatic relief.\n\nWe apologize for any miscommunication with the adjustment over the phone. We don't include an adjustment with our initial evaluation process until we find out if we can help.  As a token of our apology, we would like to earn back your trust by inviting you back and adjusting you at our cost.

I just recently joined the Greater Life family and have been feeling so much better since starting my adjustment program. When they say family they really mean it. They know everyone who walks through the door and treat every patient with kindness and respect. They took their time in evaluating how best to help me and set up a chiropractic plan that fits my student budget and schedule. Dr. Wong is extremely professional and really emphasizes education so don't hesitate to visit Greater Life! It will be the best decision you make for your spine!</text>

I work in the same shopping center as Greater Life Wellness and one day a guy approached me in the parking lot with a free ten minute massage flyer for their business. A couple hours later I had free time in between clients and thought why not and walked over. I was instantly greeted with smiles and welcoming eyes. I filled out a form of outlining the issues I was having. I was having severe neck and shoulder pain, lower back and hip pain which affected my everyday happiness and most of all sleep. I thought this was just how I was going to be forever bc I work out and do yoga normally and nothing seemed to help. And I had seen chiropractors before. The ten minute massage was just a teaser bc the masseuse had magic hands! I spoke the the chiropractor that was there and he offered me a full evaluation (valued at 400+) dollars for $20!!! Now normally I would think this was some sort of scam immediately but I went and had the evaluation and got my results and talked extensively with Dr. Wong and Alyssa about my lifestyle, family history, and my own medical history to determine why all this pain was happening and what the solution would be. Dr. Wong set me up on a four month treatment plan and it’s about a month in and I already feel relief. He warned me there are good days and bad days but the good have definitely outweighed the bad so I feel hopeful. Dr. Wong and all the people in the office at Greater Life Wellness are amazingly professional yet personable people and you can feel that is truly is genuine. There’s a reason he’s been in business for 17 years! I look forward to going to each and every appointment! Thank you Dr. Wong for taking the time to treat me and get to the root of my pain. You and your staff are what true care for others while keeping a level of professionalism is all about!< /Review>

I have just recently joined the Greater Life Family and my entire experience so far has been wonderful! The staff are very friendly and helpful and my questions are always answered. Phone calls are returned promptly. Most importantly is the care that I get from Dr. Wong. I have already felt an improvement in my health. If you join Greater Life Family Chiropractic you will be doing your health a GREAT service.< /review>

<Review>I've been going to Dr. Wong for just over a month now.  The facility is very clean and the staff is welcoming.  I appreciate that they remember my name and always acknowledge me when I come in to the office.  Dr. Wong and his team promote education for optimal health.  Not only do you get chiropractic care, but Dr. Wong offers informational gatherings and a monthly newsletter that help you make positive and healthy choices that extend beyond the visits to his office.  If you are interested in chiropractic care, I would recommend Dr. Wong and the staff at Greater Life Family Chiropractic!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80deaaf9c065e91b:0x2394ef1a3ab75011< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Dr. Wong is a lifesaver! I look forward to coming in and really feel the difference when I don't get adjusted. I have referred several friends and they too feel the change!  My energy level has definitely improved since starting chiro services as well. The staff in the office is very warm and friendly, how they know every single persons name that walks through the door is beyond me!!!Impressive. My adjustment ends with a hug from Dr. Wong and a well wish of happiness for the day! Cant wait to get in there for my adjustment today!!!</review>

I have been to numerous Chiropractors in my life! Dr. Wong' s office is very different than any of them. He teaches you about your spine and nervous system.  He cares about his patients and provides excellent care! You should try it out, you won't be sorry, believe me!<//review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Interesting experience. I was a bit skeptical at first because I had never seen a healthcare provider require prepayment for services not yet rendered. However, after having gone for a month I can honestly say it is very helpful. I go three times per week and have noticed an improvement. The doctor is a nice, personable guy, and the staff is exceptional. I look forward to my adjustments and I appreciate that they give me plenty of things for me to work on, on my own. Keep up the good work Dr. Wong.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Review>I was introduced to Dr. Wong and Greater Life Family Chiropractic by a good friend of mine. I was experiencing a lot of pain in my upper and lower back. After just two weeks of care, I can already feel a huge improvement! Not only that, Dr. Wong makes it his priority to educate his patients which is something I truly appreciate.</Review>< Pictures>

Dr. Wong has made my life so much more liveable. I have not had a debilitating back blowout in the 8yrs I've been under his care. I used to be immobized for up to 3 months everytime my back went out, and it happened several times a year.< /Review>

Associates from Greater Life came to my workplace offering a free consultation.  I hadn't been to a chiropractor in awhile & thought it a good idea to check my spine health.  I had no intention of committing to a regimen, but after seeing my results I knew it was to my benefit to accept the care from Dr. Wong.  The staff is extremely friendly & professional.  You feel they are there to help you.  I feel an improvement after only one adjustment & look forward to a renewed vigor.  I like that Dr. Wong will follow up with additional x-rays & compression checks to monitor my improvement.  I am glad I took the step to have my spine health evaluated & plan to have my husband & daughter visit Greater Life.  Thank you Dr. Wong & all the staff at Greater Life Family Chiropractic.< /text>

I was referred to Dr Wong by a colleague.  I was a little skeptical so I looked at his reviews, which are excellent.  It has been a great experience.  Dr Wong and his staff go over the process and how they can help you.  It is an investment, but one you will be happy making.  Check it out.<//Review>

This is the best experience I have ever had with a Chiropractor!   I have seen 4-5 chiropractors before this and while most had their merits, Dr. Wong's method of helping you create a 360 degree approach to health is awesome.   There is so much more I can do to help myself to become a healthier person and with Dr. Wong's guidance it has been a very insightful journey.  We are all responsible for our own health and it is a message that gets put on the back burner as we reach for our pharmacy bottles.   The atmosphere is friendly and very accepting.  It is a very warm and positive enviornment and I look forward to me appointments.< /review>

<text>I had practically given up on having normal neck function before coming here.  I was thrilled to see that without even having to describe my problems Dr. Wong was able to feel exactly where my issues were just by walking his hands down my back!  I have been to other doctors with the exact opposite experience.  Dr. Wong knows what he is doing, you are shortchanging yourself to not come in and see for yourself.  I cannot say enough great things about this place or Dr. Wong!  Everyone is so friendly and welcoming, the bedside manner is amazing, and the treatment works!  You are comfortable and informed at every step of the way.<//text>< pics>

<pics>None< /pics><review>I've been coming here since 2007 and this place has helped me so much. I can tell now when my body is out of adjustment and when I get adjusted I feel a million times better. I also notice I don't get sick hardly anymore. I definitely recommend coming here to get yourself all fixed up.

So update to this it's now 2017 and I'm still coming here. I can't imagine not having this place.  I live in Mira Mesa and travel all the way down here  just because the care is so good and staff is great friendly. I will still continue to come here and recommend this place to everyone.<//review>< username>

After just a week of adjustments with Dr. Wong my back and neck pain were virtually gone. Now a month in I rarely have any of the pain I used to. Dr. Wong and his staff are super nice and easy to work with, I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

<text>Dr. Wong is fantastic! I have been going to him for several years and I will continue to do so because he is the real deal! I wish anyone who was skeptical about chiropractic care would go to him so they could have their lives changed... haha. In all seriousness, he wants to see ALL of his patients live a life of quality through a healthy mind and body. He makes the effort to be personable and positive and I have never experienced anything less.

<Text>Greater Life and Dr. Wong has become my path after over a year of time and a ton of money going through the Sharp healthcare system.  I realize that everyone will have a different reaction based on what is wrong but for me personally, I feel relief in my thoracic spine for a disc issue for the first time in over a year from just a short period visiting Dr. Wong.  Wish I had done this sooner... Very pleasant staff as well and overall been a great experience.  I highly recommend Dr. Wong!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>I first encountered Dr Wong about a year and a half ago. About 7 months before that my low back had begun hurting badly enough that I'd had to give up dancing, given that walking alone was so painful. His office did a reach out at the YMCA in Mission Valley and had a great promotional special that got me in the door, and boy am I glad I took them up on that promotion. I found out what was going on with my spine and hips that was causing so much trouble. With Dr Wong's help I am able to walk with so much more ease, and have even started dancing a little once more. There is still much to be done, but I am so grateful for the improvement. As a massage therapist, I am very aware of the relationship of chiropractic to many conditions in the body, and I am always glad to have great chiropractors to recommend to my clients. Dr. Wong is definitely someone I have recommended many times with great pleasure.</Text><Rate>5<//Rate><userid>102471461368706490453<//userid><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record>

Two weeks ago I stumbled upon  Greater Life Family Chiropractic... Unknown to myself I stumbled into a Dr. that would forever change the way I function on a daily basis. Had X-rays taken and found that I've had major issues in my back and neck.. Literally the first adjustment I started feeling better and it has just gotten better since then.. Unlike most doctors that you visit this is one that you look forward to seeing. Greeted with a smile and by first name the moment you walk in, its as though you have been accepted into the "Family" Thank you Dr.Wong and staff..</Text>

<Text>I came to Dr. Wong over 10 years ago when I was in so much pain I couldn't stand up from a chair without pushing myself up with my arms & hands on the chairs arm rests.
After my first adjustment I was able to stand up from my chair at my desk at work without using my hands!
I've been seeing Dr Wong constantly ever since & intend to keep on. He has been my salvation & kept me working & enjoying life again! Dr. Wong and his staff are like family to me.

Going to the chiropractor is really good! Sometimes I don't even realize that my back is out of wack, but after my appointment I always feel a lot better; my muscles aren't as tense and my back doesn't hurt. Dr. Wong is kind and friendly, and we've gotten to know him better over the years. I came here as a kid, and I still come here as a teen.</text>

I did not understand what chiropractic care could do to help my body function better until I was hurting so bad and I was so stiff when getting up from a sitting position that I actually was thinking I may need hip replacement.  At this point my husband recommended that I go to see Dr. Wong!  With much trepidation and a little fear of being hurt I made an appointment for a free consultation and Dr. Wong determined and convinced me that he could help my discomfort.
I have been going to Dr. Wong now since December 2016 and I can move without pain. I know now that I do not need hip replacement and my knees are also in good working order.
Thank you Dr. Wong for your kindness and insight into the workings of our skeletal structure and how everything in our body is so wonderously connected and works together when given the opportunity!
I wish I had not waited until I was 71 years old to start addressing the aches and pains from many falls from horses, bikes and mishaps!
Sandy Schnieders.

PS
Now I am 75 and still being adjusted regularly by Dr Wong.. I feel great and can do all the things I want and need to do day to day! My advice? Take care of your body, eat right and keep in alignment with regular adjustments!

Thank you Dr Wong

I've been experiencing shoulder pain for many years and I was at the point that I was losing sleep and couldn't focus on my work. Through a friend's recommendation, I learned about Greater Life Family Chiropractic and saw that Dr. Wong had a new patient special to get x-rays and a consultation along with a 30-minute massage. I learned that my shoulder pain was off the charts and connected to subluxations in different parts of my sacral, thorastic, and cervical spine (that I could see on the x-ray)! Now, I am on a wellness plan of being adjusted and restoring my health (as the nervous system from our spine connects with many other areas of our body). Dr. Wong offers a wholistic approach in which he is concerned for our entire wellbeing, including proper nutrition, sleep position, walking, yoga, breathing exercises and more. He is friendly and really cares about his patients. It's only been a couple of weeks and I already feel so much better! Mara and Alisa are a wonderful front desk welcoming and organizing team. Alex gave me the best masssage that I have every received because he could see the x-rays and focus where I reallly needed softness in my muscles! Thank you for helping me live a great life!!!</Review>

I started coming to Greater Life about six weeks ago after taking advantage of the 10-minute work massage package that Marcel and team offer, and she talked me into the consultation appointment Dr. Wong offers.  Thank goodness she did.  I've had some very irritating knots under my shoulder blades for years, and every time a doctor had "assessed" the situation (and that usually only consisted of a couple quick questions and maybe a poke or two of the actual knot), they were quick to just grab the prescription pad and tell me to stretch more.  When I came Dr. Wong's office the first time, Jamie asked a bunch of questions and was very thorough in understanding my medical history, they performed a nerve scan and x-rays, and scheduled the follow up visit.  When I sat down with Dr. Wong, he spent his time going over the results with me, spent time informing me of my specific situation but also how the body works overall so I had a better understanding, and most importantly let me know there was a solution possible.  And it didn't include prescriptions!  About six weeks later, the corrections have already had a positive impact and the piece of mind just knowing relief is on the horizon is just as valuable.  If you've been exploring chiropractic or have been experiencing constant aches and/or pains, do your body a favor and visit the team at Greater Life.  It's a great office that has a homely feel to it and you'll feel like a valued client for sure, no company has ever treated me better as a Customer.</text>

If you have tried everything under the sun to lose weight and can't, call Dr. Wong. I have been on his weight loss program for 12 days and have lost 14.6 lbs. Just do what he says and it will fall off. All you have to do is drop your old thinking and listen and try what he says, if it doesn't work, he will figure it out with you so you will have success. Thanks Dr. Wong<//review>

One day after a weekend of shoulder and back pain I happened to walk by Greater Life and they were offering complimentary massages, a deal I obviously couldn't refuse. Afterward they offered me a full exam at a great discount and figured I should get checked up. It's a good thing I did, Dr. Wong found several problem areas that I would have never even known were there until they would have become more severe and possibly critical. Since then I've been coming in regularly for correction and maintenance for the last 5 months. It has made a huge difference in my sleeping habits, energy levels, back, neck and shoulder pain as well as helped with some weight loss. The staff has always been very friendly and accommodating. Being involved with the Greater Life has been rewarding in many ways, both for my personal health and also all the work and contributions they do in our community. I have recommended them to my fiance, family and friends.</review>

It has changed the way I view health and see life. I feel more energetic happier and confident. I don't have headaches and my light headedness has diminished. He provides quality services and has vast knowledge on chiropratry. My nerve pain has diminished and he does a great job with the adjustments. I can definitely tell a difference before and after I went to chiropractric care. It is worth every penny, I'm glad I have made the investment.<//Review>

I have been getting adjusted for approximatly 6 weeks now and I am feeling much better.  The atmosphere in the office / clinic is extremely friendly and Jessica and Dr. wong are very freindly.  It doesn't feel like any other doctor's office I have ever been to.
I would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for chiropractic services.< /text>

The most organized healthcare set up I have seen. Staff is pleasant and professional. The interest in your healthcare is paramount here. Dr Wong's knowledge and skill/art of allowing the power of communication between the nerve is what led me to trust my care to him. I was able to see in just 2.5 months measurable change for the better when my second set of xrays were taken. proof of progress is always good. I also felt the pain decrease in my shoulder and neck and the mobility in my shoulder allows me to do somuch more now than when I first came. High recommendations is given to this place of care.<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Dr. Wong is the first chiropractor I have seen.  What lead me to him was a mobility problem with my right shoulder and arm that was growing worse over the years.  I could no longer pull off my top because it hurt so much to make that over and up motion.  Eventually my arm started to go numb at night, and then ultimately I experienced numbness periodically throughout the day.  It was time to do something, but what?

According to my general practitioner, I needed to see a rheumatologist.  According to the rheumatologist, there was nothing wrong that needed fixing.  Perhaps it was my rotator cuff that was stressed but she couldn't tell from the x-rays.  She suggested that I do physical therapy, which I did, but this did not resolve the problem.  I modified my exercise routine and I set up my workspace to be more ergonomical.  Still no relief.

At the YMCA after a workout I saw that Greater Health Chiropractic was offering free chiropractic consultations, along with a 10 minute chair massage, which was excellent.  They also offered a free 30 minute massage if I came for a consultation.  I went for it.

I had my consultation and looked over the results with Dr. Wong that next week.  He described a plan of treatment and we got started that very day.  My first adjustment brought immediate mobility to my shoulder.  I was shocked.  Subsequent adjustments have focused on other areas of my spine that are in need to alignment, though not causing the sort of discomfort that my shoulder has.  The main issue is my neck, so every visit includes adjustments to my neck vertebrae plus I have started doing stretches that Dr. Wong showed me to my daily routine, which help a lot.  Also I've modified my sleeping habits (to sleep on my back) per Dr. Won't suggestion, and this helps too.

Taking a holistic approach to my body's health is making a bigger difference than the Western medical approach of isolating problems into specialties.  Adding acupuncture and massages to my chiropractic treatments will further help me, and I will do this when I can afford to do so.  It is frustrating that holistic medicine is not covered by my healthcare insurance!

I've been impressed by many things about this practice, including: Dr. Wong's professionalism and patience; the staff's friendliness and attention to detail; the free education seminars offered on various topics.  I would recommend Greater Life Chiropractic to others, who, like me, have relied on Western medicine to define our health treatment.  At least go for an initial consultation.  I'm very glad I did!<//Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

When it comes to my insurance needs, I always rely on Rob and his team.  By providing personalized one-on-one services, he was able to advise me where I needed it most and gave me the time and information I needed to make a decision. My time spent with Rob was efficient and thorough; I learned about the importance of focusing on the long view of my insurance needs. He also helped me acquire the most competitive price.   I highly recommend Rob Casares and his team.<//Text>

I've been with State Farm - Robert Casares for over 20 years. Robert and his staff are the best at what they do. Whenever I have a question or an issue, I call or walk in to the office and Michelle Martin is always there to help me. She is very knowledgeable and attentive in resolving any issues I may have. She is without out a doubt a great agent!
I've also been helped by Micaela in many occasions and is also very attentive to my insurance needs. Great customer service from her as well.
I highly recommend this office. A company that I always trust with the best customer service. A+++++</review>

I can't say enough about the service in this office. I've being having for 6 years a great car insurance with another company but I notice that changes were made and no agent never contacted me for feedback. And price policy is to high and not even include condominium protection. Then I contacted Rob Casares State Farm office and connected with Ms. Carina a very professional lady. She listened very carefully to all my concerns, explain clearly all possibilities available and helped me safe money!
What  else can you ask  as a customer!
I share with my fiance the good news and now he is also is applying for his car insurance with me so we both win!
Thank you Carina for the excellent customer service and commitment for us to he protected all the way!

In gratitude,
Elisabet and Anthony Stallworth< /review>

The prices are ridiculously cheap here and the food is quick and efficient. The milk tea isn’t my favorite but for $6.50, you can get a drink, bowl of porridge and a side dish of either turnip cake, rice roll or Chinese doughnut. I’d say that’s a steal for San Francisco!!<//Review>

The wonton noodle soup and porridge options are decent, but they no longer offer the cheap breakfast set deals (meaning a breakfast entree with a drink now runs ~$10).<//Review>

I've been going to T-28 for many years. My favorite comfort food cafe. All delicious whether you take out or dine in. Love their Hong Kong milk tea. Service is always efficient and friendly.< /review>

Better than good but not great. Nice price, but if you are ordering something with rice, 70%-80% will be rice and 20% meats+vegetables. Still recommended.</Review>

Very good Hong Kong cafe. Good milk tea. And friendly service too, which is rare in these places.  Update -- sadly, I have to reduce from 5 stars to 3 stars after my return visit. Today, my server looked like she was the owner or manager, and the service was fine until a group of her friends/family came in. Then, she was totally engrossed in conversation with them and very much neglected other customer's needs, forgetting things and was totally clueless. I wish she would tend to her customers first, then go back to chatting.</text>

Very mom & pop shop. I was very surprised that their menu was so extensive. Almost like they didn't quite have an identity as they had HK food, hotpot, curries, korean, etc. A bit pricey for the food as it was only ok...< /Review>

<Text>Decent breakfast options. If you like Cantonese style breakfast, this place is a decent option. For around $5, you get coffee or HK style milk tea plus a choice of a breakfast item. Sample items include jook/congee, soup noodles, or soup macaroni. You can also add an additional small item for $1. Small items are like rice rolls, turnip cake or egg.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Stephen is amazing!
He is the best ever! He was God sent man- he is so knowledgeable, such a quick thinker. He took all my stress with his kindness and the support I received from him was superb. You wont get a better lawyer than him! His whole team is so professional , calming and helpful, which is just what i needed in my time of need. Prayer helps but Stephen is what was needed to manifest the justice he has brought in my life and that of my baby boy. I would definitely, without a doubt recommend Stephen and his team to anyone in need of a good lawyer that will bring you results.</review>< pics>

I was given a clear overview of my case and circumstances, I was given valuable and knowledgeable information and honesty about the financial outlook of my case. I have gone through truma as well as my daughter, so getting valuable information is important to me. I am extremely appreciative of Stephen honesty and how humble he is. I would definitely recommend Stephen!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I had a case reopen by my daughter’s father in where he wanted full custody of our child. He was doing this out of spite. I wasn’t too worry but knew I needed counsel and my previous lawyer was no longer practicing. Stephen and his team were great listeners, very professional, of good values and very responsive that it made dealing with the courts and baby daddy all that much easy. I ended up winning the case.
I highly recommend Family Law Advocacy Group to anyone dealing with a family law case.< /review>

My son and I are extremely grateful for Stephen Cho and his team. Stephen represented me professionally and effectively. He and his team (Ariel and Thomas) are extremely knowledgeable and it proved effective. From my initial consultation to the custody ruling, Stephen was always honest and upfront with me regarding all aspects of the case. I highly recommend you at least have a consultation if you are looking for a family law lawyer that will represent you honestly and well.</review>

The professional service and honesty my family received was  outstanding. I would love to mention Thomas McColl. I was very appreciative of his attention to detail and his ability to put together a narrative that explained my point of view to the court. I hired this amazing group 2 days before my court date. I felt like I had no voice in the court room, I was outgunned and outmatched. Thomas leveled the playing field. He put me in a position to protect my son. He was early, he was prepared, and fully informed.</Review>

Working at FLA for over the past two plus years has been such a pleasure. Steve and Mike have not only been great bosses, but wonderful mentors as well. I have seen their dedication, not just to their staff, but to their clients first hand. Steve, Mike, Ariel, and all the staff here work hard to make sure their clients needs are taken care of. If you need compassion they got you, if you need a shark of a lawyer, well they are the best!</review>

The team at Family Law Advocacy Group were able to navigate a very complex issue surrounding my custody and visitation rights as a father.  They were able to make the process much less stressful for me and the children.  I would highly recommend this team without hesitation; they were diligent, sincere and extremely professional at all times.</review>

I can not speak enough about the professionalism and the diligence Stephen Cho and his fellow attorney's are at this firm. They are very accommodating and make sure all your issues and concerns are given a solution. If you want somebody who will get you results and guide you to the best probable solution. I would recommend them to anyone.< /review>

I rarely write any reviews, but Stephen is really good at explaining my outcome to me and what is the best choice for me. Unlike other lawyers who would give me quick answers, Stephen helped me to resolve my case quickly and painlessly. If I ever have other legal issues he will be the first one to contact. thank you!</review>

<review>I just recently started working Stephen Cho and from our first meeting I knew that I was in good hands. Stephen took his time with me to listen and understand my situation and my needs never once making me feel rushed or that I wasn’t important. He makes himself very available and if he is busy gets back to me very quickly. I have 100% confidence in him and know that he will be very upfront and honest with me. Will absolutely recommend him! Thank you so much Stephen!< /review><Resp>None< /Resp></record>

Thomas McColl greeted me within about 15 minutes. we went over different scenarios. and filled me  on my rights under family law. I felt so relieved. i hope whoever is seeking for a attorney,.......come here, sit back,  relax and watch Thomas work hard for you. name someone else available to you weekends, and even  late nights. if i could give him 10 stars i would.</text><Time>1596372333042<//Time>< gmapID>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Stephen recently took over my divorce and my experience with him so far has shown me that it’s not only important to pick the right attorney but one who is familiar with the court your case will be held. Stephen came into my case 2 1/2 yrs into my divorce and child custody case and when I came to him I was a worried mess because my experience going through this process had been so poor.  The first time we appeared in court I got chills from how different the experience was from all the times before. It was such a night and day experience that for the first time in the 2.5+ yrs I’ve been going through this divorce process, I was able to finally get a goods nights rest. He doesn’t sugar coat things and sets proper  expectations. He has good communication and follow up. I feel he has made such improvement in my case in the couple of weeks he has been on. I can’t put into words how grateful I am to have found Stephen and his team. I only wish I would have retained him sooner.<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Ms. Carter was amazing!  A true professional in every aspect.  Pays close attention to every detail and kept me aware of every action in my divorce case.  Remained calm when needed and fought for me when required.  She did not back down. This was no easy feat with my ex-spouse either. Sought feedback and took a collaborative approach while adding her professional knowledge and skill set to every legal aspect of my case!  I would recommend Ms. Carter for any case moving forward.  Quick responses to emails and calls. Prepped me for case and had every legal document for me through every court hearing in my case.  She did not miss a court date for me even though my ex-spouse failed to show for several of her cases.  We won on everything Ms. Carter put in front of the court.  Simply an amazing attorney and her office is sharp too! I walked away a super, satisfied customer working with Ms. Carter and CKBVienna law group.  We won BIG! Happy to share my experience with anyone.  Ethical and professional beyond belief.< /Review>

Let me start off by saying, Stephen Cho is a straight shooter attorney and does it so graciously. He moved mountains for my family and I. He took a situation where I was going to loose my children and turned it around in a matter of weeks. In the beginning, I had a lot of doubt because of what I had experience with another attorney. I learned over the year's, there are a lot of attorney's that will sabotage your situation just to make a buck and soon I realized I spent thousands of dollars and was faced with the reality, of losing what matters to me the most, MY KIDS. Then Stephen Cho came in (single-handedly) with one hand tied behind his back and conquered. Stephen Cho has an amazing work ethic and really cares. He cleaned up, year's worth of damage and transformed my situation, he is truly a MacGyver. There are a lot of attorney's out there, that can't be reached when needed or will take days to respond back to a situation. Stephen Cho is prompt, organized and is always on time. He is honest, loving, caring and a straight shooter. I would recommend FAMILY LAW ADVOCACY GROUP to anyone! The name speaks for itself and they will truly advocate for you. They changed my life, my children's life, for the greater good. I thank GOD I found FAMILY LAW ADVOCACY GROUP.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<review>Up until now I have not been in a predicament where I needed the services of an attorney, but I’m glad I went to Steve Cho. He has been there for me every step of the way- providing me with sound legal advice and explaining everything thoroughly. He is also a great supporter of the military.< /review><user_name>dansig1229< /user_name><Time>1595741707963< /Time>< rate>

Stephen Cho and his legal team at CKB Vienna LLP provide professional legal services beyond my expectation. He takes time to logically explain my situations and cases with details and identity various options and risks associated with each option in ways that I can easily understand and to save me time, money, legal expenses, and maximize their outcomes. He plans and strategize on my behalf for the best possible results so as long as I am forthcoming with information. He is honest, pragmatic, and ethical.  I am proud to have Stephen Cho as my legal team. I highly recommend Stephen Cho and his legal teams CKB VIENNA LLP and Family Law Advocacy Group.< /Review>

He answered all of my questions and then asked me some as well, which spoke of his balanced insight. He is up front and reliable and not least of all, accomplished what he set out to do! I recommend him 100%.< /text>

Stephen Cho is an extremely honest and knowledgeable attorney. His advice saved me thousands of dollars!

He was quick to assess my situation and give me straight facts during my appointment. Not only that but he promptly responded to all my questions via email after my free consultation the same day.

He put my interest first and I truly appreciate that.

Hard to come across sincere attorneys like Stephen!

I highly recommend him.< /Review>

Steve is the best.  His compassion and dedication to his clients and cases is without reproach.  He has been working on our case for 3 years. The delay is no fault of Steve or the Firm, but instead opposing parties.  At no time have we felt that he was not giving us 100%. I would highly recommend the firm, especially Steve.<//text>

Steven Cho has been representing me and my business for several years including my Divorce settlement, estate planning and legal contracts. They are extremely knowledgeable, honest and upfront and I have always been very satisfied with their services.  And over the years we have become great friends.  Their support and advise has helped me through difficult times and their expertise has protected my business. Having the best legal counsel makes all the difference and I highly recommend Steve.<//text>

<user_name>Lorne Havenhill</user_name><Rate>5<//Rate><text>Steve Cho and Ariel Carter shine as examples of compassion, integrity, efficiency, intelligence and poise in a legal industry often corrupted by greed and corruption.  There are lawyers (my ex wife's lawyer) who create chaos and lies intentionally to drag events and costs out for years.  Steve and Ariel addressed this head on in a professional manner that opposing counsel just couldn't handle.  Opposing counsel was simply outclassed.  I call Ariel "the closer" ...because of the way she shut him down and stopped his games at court.  Choosing divorce attorneys can be one of the most important decisions of your life.  I'm glad I chose Steve and Ariel...<//text></record></dataset><record>

If you are looking for an experienced, professional law firm I highly recommend this one. I had the privilege of working with Stephen Cho who guided me and fought for me during a difficult restraining order process. What really stood out to me about Stephen is his honesty when it comes to the quality of your case and chances of success in court. His ability to  prepare you for every possible outcome in court is remarkable as well. I am extremely satisfied with the outcome of my trial.<//review>

You will walk out of his office feeling better knowing he is on your side.  A couple of my friends hired him and were also pleased with the results.  Going to court can be scary and confusing when you don't know all the legal terms, which is why it is important to have a good attorney by your side.<//review></record>

They put up with me during the most difficult time of my life and they didn’t give up on me...they never gave up.... thank you. Now that my matter is done and I have some persepective, my lawyers were really there for me.... I am happy to do a positive review for them....< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!  Do yourself a favor (if possible). Go to two or three family law attorneys for consultations (even if you have to pay for one of the consultations) do not fill out an initial packet. Just give them your name and phone number.(this is what I did!!!)   THEN,  set up a consultation with Family Law Advocacy. If you do not have the ''time'' to do the above mentioned.....''trust me''....You will feel really good about ''locking-in'' with the attorneys here and the entire staff!!!  I had an extremely difficult / complicated divorce case. The attorneys and staff from day#1 , after taking my case, were very aggressive in getting my case all organized,  and in my situation,  ready for trial !!!  At my trial, i was extremely impressed with the professionalism, knowledge of the law, and courtroom skills that my attorney displayed. And; yes, we won the case!!!  All the attorneys at Family Law Advocacy are very knowledgeable, aggressive (in the right ways), smart, professional, and very loyal. They all treat you like family...(not just another client!!!)  Special note; Very well organized team...and, they always return your phone calls, emails, and texts  very quickly which is very nice!!! Also; they are very familiar with the court here and in surrounding cities. It is my complete honor and priviledge to post this review!!!  Thank you all for ''having my back''!!!  If any of my family, friends, or co-workers are ever in an unfortunate situation like i was in.....i will for sure send them to you all knowing that they will be in ''good hands''!!! Special mention to Steve....''Thanks Steve- you are awesome''!!!

<Review>I couldn’t have picked such an amazing firm. The staff is friendly and very responsive. My case has been a pretty rough however during my court hearing stephen cho had my ex attorney shook and unable to think. He’s followed through with everything he said he will do for my case. Im glad I found him and this firm. I would recommend to anyone with a very difficult case.< /Review>< Pics>

I could not even schedule a phone consultation because "certain" information was required from the receptionist which legally they do not need to schedule a phone consultation! The person I spoke with was Bonnie and I can say that she was horrifically rude. You guys need to hire someone else because she is scaring away potential clients.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Stephen Cho and Bastiaan VanDerBerg helped me with a very unusual child custody case with an uncertain, possibly dire, outcome.  From the very beginning, they were honest and straightforward and helped to develop a plan out of a messy situation (after I had spent several months and thousands of dollars working with another attorney and literally getting nowhere).  I worked primarily with Bastiaan VanDerBerg, who is sharp, articulate and strategic, and who was very responsive to my emails and text messages.  Also, importantly, he was considerate and polite and a pleasure to work with.  My child custody case had a positive outcome and I am very appreciative to both Stephen and Bastiaan for their professionalism and dedication to my case.<//Review>< Resp>

<Text>Obviously, this place is a local favorite. I always get their cookies, which are really soft and buttery, as well as big as my head. The conchas are really cloudy and soft, with a nice crispy sugar topping. The The jalapeno bolillos are amazing- they have ham, cream cheese, jalapeno, and sometimes pineapple in them. They make a good breakfast and are probably my favorite thing there!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><user_id>103274678235094280555< /user_id>< Rating>

<Text>Great pastries and juices when they have them. Concha, churro and a variety of other cookies and sweets make up my favorites. This place is very affordable. The best selection is usually around 9-10AM, after they load the cases from baking in the mornings. This place is a little secret of the delta region.< /Text>< Name>

The worst service I have seen is super rude that you make an order and tell you that if one day and the next day that that is not professional, I do not recommend it at all they were super bad for me 😒

The wors end rudness service, they say yes to your order one day end next day they say no, not profesional !!  El peor servicio que e visto es super grosero que agas una orden y te digan que si un dia y al otro dia que no eso no es profesional, no lo recomiendo para nada me quedaron super mal 😒<//review>

<review>Nice remodeled park. Playgrounds still closed per Covid but it's all been nicely maintained and upgraded now. My kids are ready for it to be safe to open but until it does we can keep walking around it to stretch our legs.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMVL9NA5FY-enDGDdH8foufcQMU13_PJC6OHpDS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPgAkNJgzJuk7mMLQQV8R1nDznsJ-kb0aIJ1X-j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0fMEgs3Ui3ZfaXaCBKx23R_mrAbuReXKLhVJh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkH6VjeSypftwmk5fZttKCZx5J3kZtKC8L9oud=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>Love this neighborhood park, it's a block from my house which makes it super convenient. It has been newly renovated. New gazebos and full track lining the outskirts of the park. Beautiful and serene. The only downfall is sometimes in the evening teenagers will gather under a gazebo and smoke marijuana, quite annoying.< /review>< pics>

<review>It's relatively simple with two kids play area. They created an exercise area. You see adults walk around and exercise. It has parking. Wheel chair parking. There was a staff personnel keeping the area clean and letting us know the parents or visitors know the restroom 🚻 would be closing. Didn't need to with my little ones but I'm certain it must of been well stock and clean.<//review><userid>115295315171986255588</userid><Pics>None<//Pics>< Gmap_id>

Lots of grass and big enough to walk or run at. Lots of kids play areas. Lots of people walking their dogs and the occasional crackhead.</Text>

Rather small park, plenty of shade from trees. Pleasant to walk through when there's no city workers cleaning.< /review>

Grew up in nearby Paramount and let.me just tell you, even though it's a downey city park its locals are generally ex or active gang  members of Paramounts most violent gangs as far as safety it's by far from it,would not recommend working out there at nights or Early mornings,plenty of Gang Activity from local Paramount Gangs in the area it's nothing short of Unsafe, be advised dont be Mislead<//text>

<review>What can one say about this or any other Golden Corral, except Go there Hungry. A true all american buffet, all you can eat foods from salads, chicken, ribs, meatloaf, steak and of course dessert(s) and much much more! While the food is far from top shelf, it is more than adequate , but again, it is a self serve buffet.This location seems to shine a little better, both in food presentation, selection as well as service, than other Golden Corrals I/We have been to. We found this Golden Corral to be clean and the food good. A great value for the money. Overall Rating~ Very Good!</review>< Pics>

<review>The place was closed I came all the way from the valley just because my friend lives close by when I got there everything was closed and I just wanted a resting spot but no sign no nothing. At least post online that it's closed . It's annoying because I have physical problems.<//review><GmapID>0x80c2cd3d59bf89bd:0x9518e43c48d5fd62< /GmapID>< pictures>

Calm park. Not too big and not too small!  Mostly people exercising, playing sports, walking their dogs and very family-friendly. Children's play area/ equipment is new and pretty nice, children enjoy it.  Downey police do patrol the park often.< /Text>

We're we go to hangout from 8pm to 5 in the morning, never crowded or loud, a fun place for college kids to meet-up and just mess around(what my group uses it for), but its it's also a great place for little ones to get out and play and exercise< /Text>

(Translated by Google) I cannot comment much on this park, I have cycled it a few times but if I can say that the few times it has been there, it is clean it is free of crime and I do not know they see gang boys I can say that it is a very good family park for walk

(Original)

<text>So Great We Used Them Twice!

Sincere thanks to All In moving! After having a really unpleasant professional relocation about 20 years ago, I told myself I'd never use movers again. However, after a marathon of  work  to prepare to sell our house, I simply had no energy to do the move. We solicited multiple bids from Yelp (super easy), and finally decided to go with All In Moving. So glad we picked them! VS crew did just as careful a job as I would have done...but they did what would have taken me a week or more in six hours. They moved our house first, and then our garage contents a week later, including a universal gym. Both teams were professional, courteous and very respectful of COVID procedures (masks and keeping distance). Highly recommend...we'll go with All In Moving for our next move  for sure!<//text>< Time>

Everything was professional, courteous, respectful and effortless. From booking a schedule to eventually re-scheduling it and getting discounts, explaining how everything works including travel time rules — transparent, clear. It was worth every penny in my opinion.

The 3 delivery professionals: Michael, Jose and Brian were very respectful, courteous, professional and on time. They got the job done and our family's move to our new home was as seamless as it could be.< /review><Date>1623893799626</Date>< pics>

The movers (V &S) did a fantastic job!  They arrived on time, were very friendly, and worked nonstop.  They made sure everything was well wrapped and handled all my belongings with care.  They were very good humored despite difficult stairs, bulky furniture, and ongoing construction.  I would definitely recommend these movers and this company!  Thanks again!<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>From start to finish, my move was handled fabulously!
The customer service was friendly, patient with all my questions, and thorough. The crew was terrific! Junior, Justin G and Justin I, and Jaime, were professional, and unbelievably hard working. They just did not slow down all day long. I couldn't believe what a cohesive and coordinated team they were! Friendly, respectful, considerate despite it being a long, hard day.
They were the only company that estimated my truck size & team needs accurately. They only glitch was that I actually had more heavy furniture than anticipated, and it took a lot longer than anticipated, so the final bill was significantly higher. But after seeing those guys work non-stop so hard, I did not mind - they were worth every penny, ending a 12 hour day with moving lots of heavy office cabinets and bookshelves to the second floor!  If I had sent in photos in advance, I am sure they would have been more accurate.
And not a chip, crack or dent in any furniture or in either house.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1622758448322, 'text': 'Hello, Deb Bakker, thank you for hiring our company for your moving project.'}< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>I did a lot of research when selecting a moving and storage company and I am so pleased that I found All in Moving!

Their service was great. The crew arrived right on time (actually 4 minutes early) and had my entire apartment packed up in the truck in less than an hour! The two guys were super pleasant (VS and Rick) and friendly and I felt comfortable that they packed up all of my furniture well. I also called ahead asking if they could help me pack up some paintings and they did it in a snap!

The price was comparable to other 'move to storage' options I found. I looked into getting a storage unit and then just having a moving service take my stuff their; however, you can't beat a moving day that is over by 9:30AM. I loved being able to sit in an empty apartment after everything is in the truck and know that they would handle putting my stuff into storage (I am renting storage space from All in Moving)

Thank you!</Review><Rate>5</Rate>< Date>

I had to move on short notice and thought I would have to pay way more than normal.  However All in Moving were available and saved the day!  We had 2 guys, Junior and Home Depot (yes, he goes by Home Depot!) come and get us completely moved really quickly.  Also Junior went the extra mile by properly putting my bed together back to spec (the last movers did a horrible job on the last move).  I really appreciate their professionalism and friendly nature and will definitely call them the next time I move!</Text>

These guys were great from beginning to end. They were prompt, quick, polite, professional, and their price was good. I wanted to get the place more prepared before they came, but time did not allow that. The guys were not fazed at all. They were super friendly and just got to work getting everything done. I would have no hesitations in recommending them to anyone in the future! Thanks guys!</text>

Junior and his crew of 5 showed up on time with two trucks as promised. They were respectful and professional and wore masks during the move. Everything was moved in one day, furniture placed where requested, and tweaked as needed. As I watched them work it was clear that they were experienced by seeing how they handled heavy items, wrapped furniture, and managed the stairs and corners during the move. They also volunteered to do additional large and small tasks that we were planning on doing ourselves and that was an additional help. We were extremely happy with their services.< /text>

<user_name>Lisa Smiley<//user_name><Review>On the office side, Alex was very professional and flexible. The on-site estimator was also great. We used a 3-man packing crew the day before our move (I highly recommend this, because just when you think you've packed it all, there's more!) and ended up taking 1 truckload down that night and then a 5-man crew with 2 trucks on the main day of our local move. Junior and his team worked their tails off! They were a great bunch of guys and their comradery made it fun. It's wasn't inexpensive, but they did a great job and were comprable in price to the others companies I talked to before choosing them. It was worth every penny and I highly recommend using their services. Great job guys!<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fcbef2660731d:0xb249a85a3a7b10e7<//gmap_id>< pictures>

<review>Junior and his experienced crew did an awesome job. Junior, Angel, and Home Depot arrived a little early and worked straight through for over six hours. They were courteous, friendly, and helpful - and never complained about anything, even when they had to go up one flight of stairs at our new residence. They treated our belongings like they were their own - even better than we would have in most cases. Junior consulted us frequently to make sure he was doing everything the way we wanted. They had major delay issues with the elevators in our old location but never complained and managed to get the job done in record time with no damage to the furniture and no problems of any kind. Wish we had known about them for our last move - it was a disaster. All-In's rates were affordable and the entire transaction from beginning to end was simple and easy, unlike vendors we used for other services. We highly recommend this company - and their great workers. We couldn't be more pleased. They will always be our first choice for future moves.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1600794805790, 'text': 'Thank you very much for your feedback'}<//response><gmapID>0x808fcbef2660731d:0xb249a85a3a7b10e7< /gmapID></record>

This was our second time moving with Junior's crew this year, and again we very happy with the service provided.  Everyone was professional, courteous and very hardworking.  I asked Junior at the end of the packing if they could fit two unwieldy cabinets, and he was very accommodating and figured a way to fit them into an extremely full truck.  Once arriving at our new home, they unloaded everything super efficiently and without any damage.   We have moved several times in the past few years with various companies and our experience with Junior's crew has definitely been the best!< /Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>A PERFECT JOB WELL DONE! We've moved quite a few times and, for the most part, we moved ourselves from packing, loading, transporting, and unloading small to large items/furnishings. This time I researched Home Advisor in the San Jose Area. I selected 3 referrals and decided on All in Moving Systems.

They were immediately responsive to my call. My initial contact, Arina, was very helpful and patient. I had to call back with another question and Alex, the Manager, was the one who spoke with me. Apparently, I called very late, but he was most accommodating. Alex also very personable, understanding, and very knowledgeable. It was clear to me that his clients come first. Once I agreed to use their service, I received a phone call, text message, and email confirming the move two days beforehand. They just wanted to see if I needed anything else.

The day of the move was great. They arrived in the early time of the arrival time range and called me to let me know they were en route. Both Alan and Armando were professional, personable, and eager to do the best job for us. They worked very quickly, efficiently, and handled every item with care - fragile and otherwise. The transport and unloading to our storage unit (up a flight of stairs) went very smoothly, all to their credit.

Overall, I'd rate All in Moving Systems as EXCELLENT and highly recommend their services. In fact, I will use them again when we return to the Bay Area.

We are very pleased with the service! Junior, ceasar, and max moved us out of our 2b, 2b apartment into a house. The move was complicated given the location of our apartment, yet all our items were delivered with extreme care. We had absolutely no damage to our items or space. They were professional, fast, and kind! They didn't complain once, and in fact expressed enthusiasm for their job. The only reason we would rate a 4.5 is that the company was 5 hours late and the move probably required 4 not 3 movers given the apartment design. They offered us a discount, however, to make up for the time it cost. They were in good communication up to the move and were v transparent Re: pricing. We would definitely use this company again.</text>

They were excellent at every turn!  The scheduling was very flexible and responsive to my constraints.  The moving team of Junior, Max and Hugo stayed in touch throughout, confirming the move date/time prior to and the morning of the move.  They showed up on time, worked very quickly and professionally.  When a few large furniture items had trouble fitting through the door they did some creative problem solving and solved it!

I would recommend them highly!  Junior was very professional, polite, and flexible.  When they got to the destination, not only did they unload the furniture but were also very patient in helping to organize and even helped fix a futon that was already there.< /Text>

My initial review was:

"Looks like they hire thieves"

Let me clarify...

After asking around and getting recommendations we decided to hire the All In Moving System company.

We spoke with Bogdan, Alex, and Max from the company and they all made a very good impression.

Organizational part was excellent. Movers arrived on time.

However the following was not good...

During the move we noticed $700 missing from our son's wallet. Yet we decided not to report this...

But about two weeks later we discovered missing jewelry. At this point we contacted the company and reported to the police.

Initially we did not want to proceed with criminal investigation, but the company suggested that we should.

This is the current status. I wish to be able to leave a better review, but cannot...<//text>

All in Moving Systems helped me move from Davis to San Francisco in July 2020. From the scheduler, Bob, to the movers, Jose G., Jose V., and Richard G., I had a great experience. All four were very professional and courteous, asking questions along the way to make sure that everything was moved and put in the correct spot. The movers showed up on time and took about 3 hours to load my old 2 bedroom apartment and 3 hours to unload into the new 2 bedroom apartment. In the time of Covid-19, the movers wore masks and maintained social distancing which made my partner and me feel safe. This is no easy task given given the hot summer day in Davis. The movers  also were very accommodating to our nervous dog. I would definitely recommend All in Moving Systems.</review>

This was my first time using movers. Max and Jose were on time, communicated well, had great hustle while being respectful to my things, and I would happily use them again. Bob made the appointment easy. I paid cash for a discount and will use them again.
The price quote is a rough estimate and many factors of your move an affect time and cost. You cant be rigid as the final price comes at the end. If you you pack and help you will have more control over time.< /text>

For the San Jose All in Moving I called All in Moving System for long distant moving(5 hrs). We were in a hurry to move. This company was the only moving company calling us back. I was give a reasonable price. They stuck to the price as we discussed as the end of the move. But the best part of all that impressed me the most was the mover— Alan,Deon and Alex. These guys know how to pack that truck. I did not think so. But they were able to get everything I had in the truck in every little corner. Did I say how fast these guys are. They are quick and extremely friendly. I would recommend them to anyone.<//Review>

The movers arrived on time and did a good job wrapping my furniture. Everything went smoothly and as planned. Richard Gutierrez and his helper properly moved my Sleep Number bed that needed to be wrapped and transported with care. I recommend them for moving services.<//Review>

<Text>We had an amazingly smooth and organized move. Jose and max came in the day before for packing and dismantling the furniture. They both were exceptionally kind and co-operative during the whole process. The next day same amazing experience as Hugo joined the team to do the moving. They were very patient in understanding what we needed and went above and beyond their work to make the move very peaceful for us. We would hire them again in a heartbeat!<//Text>< pics>

Junior, Max and Pedro helped us move to our new home earlier today. They were great at packing our furniture and moving our boxes. At our new home, they double checked with us in setting our furniture at all the right places.

Our move took a little over 6 hours. I felt bad that I could not offer any drinks to these men due to COVID,  and they had to wear their mask throughout, which they did not try to remove at all while they were at our place.

These are experienced men, Junior moved our sofa and recliner as if it were large teddy bears! Max packed my kitchen items for me (the only thing I left for the movers to pack). Pedro arranged our things in their truck and moved things with others.

In all I highly recommend this company for your moving needs.<//Text>

<review>Junior and his team helped my wife and I move in early March and it was an amazing experience! The team was very timely, professional, and made a breeze of the work. All in all, the move from one apartment to the next took just three hours and everything was transported safely.

Even when we realized after the move that there was an item left on the truck, Junior when out of his way the next day to drop it off which was super appreciated.

I'll definitely be using All in Moving Systems again for any future moves, and will be requesting Junior and his team by name!< /review><Rate>5</Rate>< UserId.>

< Review>
From the beginning of our moving process, Alex,  who was very professional, explained the moving process, showed us pictures on his iPad of previous moves to give us an idea of how our furniture would be handled, and gave us the best estimate of all other companies. On the day of the move, Junior, Jose and Max showed up on time and they worked hard and efficiently protecting and wrapping our furniture. They were all friendly and nice. After a 3.5 drive to the new house, they put down a red carpet to protect our floors then begun to bring in all our boxes and furniture. I was amazed when Junior was willing to move something a second time to make sure I was happy with the location. I was really impressed with Jose and his professional attitude and work ethic, and happy smile, he was amazing. Max is a quick hard worker. We are very happy with All In Moving System. Thanks guys.<//Review>

<Review>Overall, very happy with the experience. Moving can be a hassle in best of times. These guys were (led by Junior, their team leader) were very polite, courteous, and most importantly, very accommodating to last minute changes and requests. All the items were delivered without any damage. They even made an extra trip from/to our houses for some stuff we had forgotten. Gladly recommend their services to all would-be movers.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Very bad service...  I had an appointment in the afternoon but they didn’t come because they couldn't finish their morning work. They never informed us that situation until I called them. I had to reschedule the moving date with readjusting all related mtg.
In addition that they increased moving stuff from 2 to 3people without any confirmation and charged for 3 person. Besides that they left a lot of dust all rooms after move-in...
I dont recommend this company. If you use this company, you will waste your time due to their lack of manner.</text><gmapID>0x808fcbef2660731d:0xb249a85a3a7b10e7</gmapID>< user_name>

FIVE STAR SERVICE - I highly recommend.

From the quoting process with Alex to the actual load out / in with Amir and his team, it was a smooth and seamless process.

HIGHLIGHTS
*Super price competitive
*High Customer Service
*Moving team on-time, professional and overall nice guys
*Excellent truck, equipment and materials
*Quality care of my household goods (art and fragile items wrapped)
*Arrived at move in destination on time

I thoroughly researched many moving companies and ultimately selected All In Moving based on price, customer service and past reviews.

Because of their outstanding service, I can confidently recommend their services to my real estate clients in future.< /Review>

We had Junior, "Home Depot" and "The Guy" handle our move of a two bed/two bath house across town. All In Moving was on time, super clean and careful, and a lot of fun to work with. We had a lot of stuff to pack up and the guys handled it safely and efficiently. When we got to the new house the guys loaded the furniture quickly and carefully.

Our experience was great and would highly recommend them.<//text>

I had a wonderful experience with the team over at All In Moving Systems! Richard and Anthony were on time and extremely fast! They did such an amazing job, all by themselves in 4 hours.. I’m so impressed on how they single handedly moved an entire one bedroom by themselves. I’m especially grateful to the care they put into properly wrapping our furniture so it was protected. They took no breaks and did zero talking, they got busy! Much props to these two men. Oh, I forgot to mention, the truck they had was massive. Not those rinky-dink trucks you see some companies use. These guys are pros. Highly recommend this service.</Review>

The movers (Junior and Home Depot) were punctual. They called when they were nearby. They were quick, efficient and ascertained my wishes where necessary. They were respectful of me and my belongings. My belongings arrived at my new apartment in the same condition they left the old one. Junior and Home Depot were friendly and worked well together. I would use All-in Moving Systems again and hope for the same efficient, friendly movers.<//Text>

<Review>Start with a very reasonable price and quote.  They do what they say, with no hidden fees.  Add a three-three man crew lead by Alan, who worked at the same quick-pace for 5 1/2 hrs, including dealing with loading dock issues at the apartment building.  I've moved many times, but this was the best easiest move I've had.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I've moved A LOT and All In really takes the cake as top quality full service moving company. They helped with me a move and storage during the summer of they were wonderful right from the start. Quick and response communication from Bob to set me up, clear and fair pricing, and he really made me feel at ease as we didn't initially know our final destination. They were incredibly professional and really put my mind at ease, especially with COVID protocols. For each move (packing/loading and drop-off/unloading) the crews were on time, professional, took great care of our items, and worked diligently throughout their time.
Some things that stood out:
- They are all professionally through and through. They knew what to do, went right to work, asked questions along the way when needed, and made me feel very confident in their services.
- They all followed COVID protocols and ensured to keep us safe
- They seemed to go above and beyond in every measure. As an example, one of the guys very thoughtfully rescued a picture of my late father that was hidden in our garage behind a smashed frame.

Overall, I highly recommend All In Moving and encourage you to reach out to get a quote on your move. These guys can do it and will make one thing about your move less stressful!

Shoutout to the packing/loading crew: Junior, Max, Anthony, James & Angel
Shoutout to the drop-off crew: Alan, Angel, Armando, & Jose

I hired two movers, and these guys packed up furniture from my 1 bedroom place in less than 1.5 hours. I had little bits and pieces lying around, but they just wrapped  everything up in that moving plastic wrap and packed it away, no problem. The place was tricky to navigate in that huge truck but the driver, Alan, backed up out of my tiny driveway like it was nothing. Great experience overall.</text>

We sold the house and had to move out everything to the storage unit.
All in Moving Systems was very responsive and accommodating to our needs. We got them booked literally few days before the move out date and were a little nervous. Moving is always stressful and of course, we were worried about the entire process. Manager assured us that everything will be taken care of, as they are professionals. At that point we just had to trust them and relax. And we were not disappointed! The movers arrived even before the scheduled time and started packing the furniture and big electronics right away, without losing a minute of time. Movers were very nice, patient, and attentive to details. Everything was packed so nicely and secure that we felt at ease. The truck was loaded within few hours and we all headed to the storage unit. We offered to get them a lunch but they said they have another move after us and don't want to be late there as well. WOW!
They unloaded everything even faster and helped us to “tetris” all of the furniture, boxes and home electronics in the best way, so everything fits. I am amazed with the level of their professionalism! They are totally like ninjas with the entire moving process! Great customer service and reasonable prices, I would definitely recommend All in Moving Systems to everyone!<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Moved today with All in Moving Systems and these guys were fantastic! Their rates was very affordable and the movers themselves were nothing but professional, quick and amazing. I've moved with quiet a few moving companies in San Jose but All in Moving Systems is the best company without any doubt. The move itself went smoothly. I needed to make a quick stop at my public storage unit on the way to our new house, they said: No problem Sir! I also would like to mention that the entire team that was sent to move my house showed nothing but respect to my elderly parents who were present there during my move. Will call you guys next time I move. Thanks!<//Review>< gmapID>

< review>
I decided to go with All in Moving Systems based on my neighbors high rating of these guys (and he is very picky dude!).

I have never used moving company before, so I did have some ideas about packing and moving and how it works. Their website was a breeze to use. I've call them after learning the rates and conditions. The guy on the phone was friendly and professionally polite, he explained to me all about deposit, packing and loading, went over availability and I have scheduled my move.

On the day of my move, I was the first job scheduled for the day, so the movers arrived by 8:40 am previously calling and letting me know their ETA. Movers worked tirelessly for 6 hours in some rainy and challenging conditions, making all the corrections that we were requesting. All of my possessions made it to my new house in same condition as it was when it left my old crib and the movers were very careful not to scratch any doors or walls in the hallway of both buildings. Movers handled all the delicate items with great care. Un-loading was done a bit quicker, and the movers were extremely courteous. They were gentle and careful not only with my furniture and fragile stuff, but also with the new wood floor, which I was always worried about any scratches due to the moving of heavy furniture.

Everyone in this company, from the dispatch to the foreman and movers have the best professional ethics, great personalities and boy were they efficient!!!

I definitely recommend All in Moving Systems to anyone who is looking to make their move headache-free, efficient, and painless.

I don't have a single complaint.<//review>

I am wherry happy with All in Moving Systems performance with our move. We had a wherry positive experience as we had a last-minute commercial move scheduled in a short notice, and their team took care of the COI fast and made a full office move within a few weeks. They were hard-working and punctual; the move was completed in a timely manner.  also, we had a sizable thermal chamber that was wherry challenging to move where the All in Moving Systems dealt with the difficulty of this oversized< /Review>

I will use them again and will recommend to my friends and family. Thank you All in Moving systems.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoZqFENDAxRrd26Ol6LWvhYgKZuEJTCt6R0fp-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< resp>

I want to thank Eugene and partner for doing a terrific job moving my furniture and belongings on Sunday morning, April 7. They worked efficiently and professionally. Items were wrapped, clothes closets were provided; they were very careful and their great effort got the job done and done well!
It was a tough order to being my furniture to a place with 3 flights of stairs. They continued their careful and efficient approach to bringing all my belongings into my new apartment. Nothing was damage!
Both Eugene and partner are to be commended!<//review>

I don't usually write reviews, but this is an exception. Moving during COVID-19 time is difficult. It's not easy to find a professional company at the right price. But All in Moving System did it! Since I'm moving on a Friday, I'm paying $115 an hour in cash （$105 an hour on other days).
Before the move, customer service Bob confirmed with me about the moving time and budget, and today, two movers: Alam and Angel arrived at my 1B1B apartment on time. They were very professional and careful to help me move all my luggage and furniture, and they helped me unpack, package, and reinstall my furniture. They finish everything is 3 hours!  Fast, punctual, transparent prices. I think for a moving company, All in Moving System did an excellent job.< /review>

<Review>We requested quotes from five different moving companies for a medium sized project. While we did not proceed with All-In Moving Systems' bid they were excellent in getting us a quote with a very competitive rate and a certificate of insurance very quickly. Their response time was the best out of all the companies we requested bids from.

However, I also received 5 emails and 6 phone calls regarding this project in less than 5 business days.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1566422024800, 'text': 'Hi Nikki, one of our main goals is to be responsive.

We worked hard to satisfy your request although we had very, very, limited time to collect, to fill out, and to process, all of the necessary documents for providing moving services in the state of California.

They were punctual letting me know the exact time they would be arriving, very courteous in all my interations, and hard working trying to get the job done as fast as possible packing and wrapping everything to make sure nothing gets damaged. Very professional, I would highly recommend.< /Review>< Rating>

Robert and the crew at All in Moving Systems were by far the best moving company I have ever worked with.  Fast, responsive, responsible, friendly, trustworthy and just a good crew of people to have worked with. They were also super helpful in helping us get rid of unwanted stuff from our old house, and moving materials from our new place after unpacking.  While I hope to never move again, I would refer them in a heartbeat.< /Text>

Moved from Oakland to Seattle, moving from a 2 BR + BR/office  apartment. Did walkthroughs and got quotes from a few movers for packing and moving, and they were the cheapest as well as offering delivery within 2-3 days (instead of 3 days-2 weeks offered by other companies). They were responsive and communicative throughout the process. Sent updates while they were driving the moving van. Called 30 minutes before showing up to pack and to unload. Not a single thing was broken!</Review>

The service is awesome. The crew arrives on time. The driver is Alan, two helpers are Pedro and Vasilly. They're polite, professional and efficient. No chatting or wandering. Finish the job in 2.5 hours. And the final charge comes out just as the estimate. No surcharge. Now I have opened all the boxes and checked every item. No damage is found. They definitely deserve a 5 star review.</Text>

We just moved this weekend from Walnut Creek to San Jose.
These guys were phenomenal. Hire them now! We moved from an apartment that was up one flight of stairs to a house with rooms full of furniture going to three stories. (first floor is garage). They were professional, organized, strong, and energetic.
They did the job efficiently and thoughtfully.
They are superior movers. We were very pleased (and lucky!).

We knew it would be a challenging job. W have a very large book and sheet music collection. Pack those heavy books in smaller boxes people! 1.5 cubic feet is big enough.

Also, if you want the best service, be sure to give these fellows plenty of drinking water all day and a hearty sandwich at lunch (they don’t ask for it, but your movers will be stronger and better!) Later, offer some strong coffee with lots of sugar for the gents. And some chocolate bars for the late afternoon push. They were awesome to say the least.</Text>

These guys are awesome! Showed up on time, were quick, careful with our stuff and did an amazing job very quickly!
The price was right and I feel like I got a great deal. I think the young guy's name was John and his partner were amazing workers. Very courteous and professional and are highly recommended!!!
I hope I never move again, but if I do this is the place that will get my business!<//Review>

We recently moved from a 2 bed condo to a single family house. It was our first time to hire a moving company. Sergey and his team arrived on time. They were very polite, professional and hard working. Our 2 bed condo was filled out a lot of stuff after 10 years. With two active 21 month old kids, we were unable to pack 100% before the moving day.  The team helped to sort everything out and packed small stuff. They packed all our furniture and TV carefully. The whole process was very smooth.

The day after the move, I noticed there some scratches on one of our beds, but I would still like to give them 5 Star. Great team! Great set!</review>

We used "All in Moving Systems" to move to our new house. We requested a four people crew because we had a lot of things to move. We had a great overall experience with this moving company. I did everything over the Internet and E-mails. The entire process was very easy. They E-mailed me a few days before the moving date to confirm. The driver called me 30 minutes before they arrived. They wrapped our furniture very carefully. They dis-assembled and re-assembled the big furniture pieces, i.e. tables and beds. They used shoe covers in our new house to keep it very clean. It was 5 hours from start to finish and everyone worked very hard. My bill was exactly what I calculated it to be.

I highly recommend this company!

Thank you folks!</Review>

However, I must say that in my decades of having to move for work all over the place, these guys outshine the rest.

It was all in good spirit as we ate pizza for lunch (provided by me, out of courtesy) and drank colas.

Dmitriy was a pleasure to deal with.  He was on time and courteous.  When the arrived at my house they were very attentive to details and made sure they understood exactly what I needed.  They took a great deal of time to wrap my belongings and keep them protected.  They also made sure to check each item for damage that was already existing and point it out to me so that they were not responsible. This attention to detail is rarely seen with movers.  There was no damage done to any of my belongings from these movers, which is a first for me.  Every other move I've done has resulted in broken or damaged items.  They were willing to help me assemble items.

Upon arrival at my new place, which has two flights of stairs, the movers worked hard to carry everything up carefully so as to not scuff any walls or banisters.

I would recommend them to anyone.<//Text>

This company is just amazing! Me and my family moved across country and coordinated everything from afar. Not only they gave us great moving/packing tips but  they also called in advance and followed up after the move. On the day of the move, they were on time and moved very quickly. The staff is very friendly and we were very pleased with the company's services.
I would highly recommend them.</Review>

All In was excellent in all phases of the move...the first call, the estimate (time and materials), and day of move, they were on time, did the work quick and safely, while being personable. Its a nice thing when one sees this kind of commitment.

They are so professional both with dealing with us and with handling our stuff.  My husband and I were so overwhelmed with our move and the movers were worth every penny in helping make it easier.  They were on time, and estimated the amount of time it would take very accurately.  We had three flights of stairs from our old place, and two in our new place - and not once did I hear them complain.  If there were any issues as all, they communicated with us right away.  They blocked the street properly and moved the truck twice for cars they blocked in - all without hesitation.  But the most important thing is that all of our stuff got to our new place in great shape.  If you are looking for professional movers with a great work ethic...book these guys.  We were very happy with their service and would use them again or recommend them to anyone.<//review>< Pictures>

Had a great experience with Eugene, Vasily & Vasily on our local move in Los Gatos.  I received a confirmation call the evening before and the team showed up exactly on time.

We had boxed most of our stuff ourselves, but the team did a great job protecting all our belongings and did a little more wrapping because it started to rain part way into the job.  It turned out we had a lot more stuff than I thought, but the team was really flexible in accommodating our needs including making an additional stop along the way to swap a dining table with a relative.

They were very careful to protect the walls/flooring as they moved our items into the house.  The only miss was one slip whereby a wet dolly tire left a bit of a track mark on the brand new carpet -- a mistake Eugene was very very apologetic for (and I'm sure will clean up).

Price was reasonable and we would totally use All In Movers again.<//review>

Would definitely use this company again (though I hope to not move for many ... many more years!!). They were prompt, courteous, and paid attention to detail. Considering the last movers I used showed up drunk and complained the whole time, I definitely appreciated every extra step Dmitriy and Angel took to ensure that our move went smoothly.</text>

We hired them to move our 2 bedroom apartment here in the Bay Area and the entire process was simply perfect. Richer, Jonhu, Danyor and Rujer showed up on time and did the perfect job. Super professional, fast and easily approachable. If you need a moving company and reliable you can trust these guys. Plus, their rate is normal not overpriced as other companies. We will definitely use them again.< /Review>

I am really happy with how the move went! Sergey and his team worked tirelessly and with great precision. They handled all the furniture with care and packed every single piece perfectly. My main worry was around the TVs as those were super thin and fragile (especially the new one), and everything went well. Another thing, my sofa bed was extra heavy and didn’t fit the doors in the new place, so folks had to be really creative to get it in. Their work was very efficient, they listened to every piece of input I provided and satisfied every request I had. Everything went smoothly thanks to their professionalism. Thank you, Sergey and team!< /Text>

I am a software engineer, but I don't make a lot of money because I just started less than a year ago. I got a good job here in Silicon Valley and was looking for a good moving company in San Jose. I found All in Moving Systems on Yelp. I found them to be strong when they handled my heavy desk and Indian rugs. I also had a rack with servers for a startup I had going, so there was a lot of expensive and breakable hardware to move. All in Moving Systems came to my apartment and treated me and my belongings with respect. I have deep admiration for Sergey, Justin, and Peter, and so I felt it would be valuable for me to offer them food. I did and they did not charge me for the time they spent eating, which was worthy to me, almost unreal. I forgot to tell them that I need the carpet they moved for me to go in first, and it was one of the last pieces out, so they essentially moved everything twice in order to put the rugs in first. I can easily call these guys professional movers because the way they put my servers into the rack with such care. There are many San Jose movers, but I like this one the most. Thank you to you all.</review>

Swift , industrious , focused ...a few words that characterize Dmitry and his team. I used their services to move out of my single bedroom apartment at short notice. Dmitry and Angel were quick to understand my situation and started planning the move as soon as they landed. They exactly knew how stressful one would feel during the move and allayed them not by words but by their actions. Dmitry was also open to mention about the tasks that i could do if i was looking to expedite the move , which was smart given that it would save time overall. Would highly recommend them for any moves.<//review>

've an absolutely wonderful experience with All in Moving Systems.My move did turn out to be a little bigger than what i've expected. Moving in to my new place, i did not have third bedroom or even a garage.  The guys at All in were very flexible and helpful. Not only did they face the challenge head on, they even were able to fit it all into one load without a single item being damaged or scratched.

Angel took considerable care disassembling and reassembling our furniture and other items at the new house. Professionally wrapped our couches and tables for safe moving. Final bill wasn't cheap but i didn't move for almost 10 years and we did accumulate a lot of s..t in our 3 Bdrm +garage+storage room house. Thanks guys!<//Review>

<Review>I want to preface this review by stating that I have never myself hired a professional moving company because I’ve only ever gotten negative reviews from friends and extended family members who have had to deal with them in the past. Additionally, between me, my younger brother, and my dad we’ve always been able to handle any moves on our own with just a cooler of beers and a U-Haul. However, due to some recent health issues with my dad and the fact that my brother is a full time student I was forced into a last minute scramble to find a moving company when we had to move my grandma closer to us here in Diamond Bar all the way from her old home in Santa Barbara. I gotta say I was taking a huge gamble with All In Moving Systems based on the fact that I knew absolutely nothing about them when I stumbled upon them online but I couldn’t be happier with how everything turned out. Dmitriy and his guys were all very professional and courteous upon meeting them on move day and most importantly they worked fast and efficiently. To my grandma’s great pleasure they handled all of her antique crap with great care and even went so far as to wrap every single bit of furniture my grandma asked them to. For the amount of work they put in I would have gladly paid double, there’s no doubt that these guys have earned my business for life. Big thank you to Dmitriy and all the guys that came out to help us with our long distance move, your hard work was greatly appreciated!

We had used All In Moving last week for two moves during our relocation process. We bought a new home and had to store some of our items in their storage while moving the rest to an apartment which we have rented until our new home is ready. They were terrific!  We had three different crews for three days, and each group was very professional, friendly and helpful.  Couple things I'd mention.  First, they were great at communication -- before and during each move.  I always felt confident that things were going as planned.  Second, they were incredibly resourceful.  We had a situation where there was a very narrow, windy staircase.  I was sure that we would not be able to get a large sofa into a 3rd floor apartment.  Sure enough, there was no way to get the sofa up the staircase.  Instead, they called two more of their crew to come (with my permission of course) and hoisted the sofa up outside the building (3 stories) and over the balcony into the living room!  Couldn't believe it and am so happy to have the sofa in the apartment.  Lastly, just want to reiterate our friendly and professional everyone was.  They constantly were moving pieces around as we were deciding where to put things.  In some cases, we moved a piece of furniture multiple times before settling on where we wanted it.  They did so without ever seeming to be put out.
We will be definitely be using All In for our next move, likely early next month.  Would HIGHLY recommend them!</review>

The food was just okay - not a stand-out.  The fried apps tasted old - the flavors inside were not distinct.  The restaurant was not busy at all and it took more than 5 minutes to be seated.  The servers were good.  For the money I expected a better experience.  Meh.< /Text>

<rating>4< /rating><review>I used to be a server for CPK... I know their food well. What's great, 1st is the service, especially at take out... they really get your order correct and are quick about it. What is not great is the fact that they have changed their bread...  it's now sourdough and very tough to eat. I feel they did that on purpose so that people would order more appetizers... whatever the case, it is not appealing and it makes me not want to order there. I know that sounds harsh,  but it was wonderful bread and its just a bummer!! Otherwise as always the food is good, esp the salads ...you cant go wrong with the BBQ chic chopped salad!! Pictured is the 5 cheese pizza, thai chic pizza and BBQ salad.</review>< Pics>

<time>1617164911286< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><Review>The wait was 40 minutes for three people, when there were many open seats. After we finally sat down and ordered it took them 20 minutes to bring out the food, which isn't unreasonable. The food was barely warm and did not taste like anything. The customer service was terrible, we had been finished with our food for almost 10 minutes before the server came to give us the bill, and the restaurant was not busy so the servers were all chatting. In short, it was a bad experience, perhaps some of these instances occurred because of Covid guidelines so I will come back after the pandemic is over.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

< Review>
The store itself is great and so is the staff. However, I have always eaten one pizza here and over the past few years I have watched the pizza go from 10.99 to 12.99 and the other day it was 16.99!! Now I don't mind paying if it is worth it, but the pizza has consistently gotten smaller, going from about 14 inches (normal large size) to around 11 inches (smaller than a medium) to the point where I finish the whole 17 dollar pizza and am still hungry.
Now this seems nitpicky, but it has happened across the menu with almost every item. Favorite $8 appetizers are now like $13. C'mon guys, this was my favorite restaurant for almost a decade. Please go back to your roots!😢</Review>

<Review>Only has 2 large tables capable of seating 6 or more for outside dining. Food and service were good. Wait was long, but that was to be expected. Worth the wait to eat with entire family and not need to cook myself.< /Review>< pics>

< review>
Well this is one of those places "a Karen designed". There will be a parking right opposite to the shop and there wont be any sign that says you cannot park.. but if you do, well they ask you to "Park over there" if you catch my drift. There are 2 entries to this shop and only one of them will be labelled as "Dine in" so check on that..(the 2nd door leads you inside and they ask you to use the "other door" ) Food in here is great which must be the only reason you choose this place ... and again check for the ingredients ... if you are allergic to any, tell them right away! else you will be choking the whole night regretting it.. overall exp was great. loved the ambiance as well.</review>

Absolutely the worst. Will never go back again. I ordered a chopped Cobb salad and called in for curb service. 25 minutes for one salad. Got there and waited for ten minutes while they made it. Got home to find the lettuce had not been chopped but sliced very very thinly Like you would see  used to plate appetizers. Once salad dressing was on it was like soup. Oh yeah and I paid $20 for one relatively small salad. The avocado was not ripe so they did not chop it up too much and just tossed it in   as one large piece and bacon was so overcooked it tasted burned and that was in a "was" too. The worst I have gotten in a very long time reflecting absolutely no effort at all.</text>

The food and service is great from this restaurant. The only problem is that their food portions have gotten much smaller over the years. The smaller sizes makes the fiod seem way overpriced, though it is tasty.</Review>

I togoed kids meal here because I wanted to eat smaller portions but with more variety. I would definitely togo kids meal again. My husband and I shared 4 kids meals. The chicken nuggets (chicken breast) and pasta with meat sauce was very yummy (not too salty). Broccoli on the side was also perfectly cooked.<//Review>

Got my order  . WTHeck happened to the portions? Got an appetizer of corn\ guacamole and came in the size of a little salad dressing cup! For  that much money?  Kids meal was flavorless, no cheese in the Mac n cheese . Will probably never order again. Very very disappointed.</text>

This is a go-to spot for our family at least once a week. The Buffalo cauliflower is amazing. They also have one of the best gluten-free crust that I have tried. Great management at this particular restaurant.</Text>

For the price of the pizza, the taste is not enough. Even if it would say gourmet, found the taste lacking compared to Pizza Hut/Dominos. And the toppings were sparse.
Surprisingly the salad they served was much better. May not go back for Pizza again.< /review>

Our waiter Chris was entertaining and attentive to all of our needs and was very prompt at taking our drink and food orders. He always approached us with a smile and positive attitude. And more importantly he wasted no time in asking us what he could do to make our experience better. So an A+ for the waiter and his professionalism. And a great job at helping sing happy birthday for my friend.

One thing to note, the wait time in being sat upon entry. Work on that especially when its slow. 10 minutes plus waiting for seating on slow day is not a good thing.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Really like wood fire pizza but the IPA was $8.69. Outrageous IMHO. Friendly staff but had to schlep up to the bar to fetch my IPA so I wouldn't succumb to dehydration waiting for the server to bring it but that speaks to my impatience as well<//review>

This place always has great service and food.   The parking can be a bit tight and it is really popular so there can sometimes be a wait, the only reason for less than 4 stars. Our kids love coming here and the staff are always great with them.   The club is free to join and to get rewards pretty easily.    Their actual food beyond pizza and salads update pretty regularly and are very tasty also.   Bar is on point and lunch specials are great as well with their mix and match options.< /text>

<Review>I checked the location on google map. It said they close at 9. I went before 8:30 all chairs were on the tables. The woman was counting the cash talking with workers. Could hardly speak english.i said so you close whenever you like? She said we have to look at how busy we are😳😳 i said really??!!
Seriously what has this country come to? I hope the corporate checks these reviews<//Review>< Pics>

Been going here for years. Started doing takeout 1-2 times a month. They get my order right about 50% of the time. Other than that service is great. Just triple check your takeout order.<//review>

This place has a good happy hour. However every time I go for dinner I'm disappointed. I don't think the taste of the food lives up to the high menu prices. I've never tried a menu item and said "this taste great!".  Im also disappointed that they will not split a dish for me and I dont like splitting it on my own because one person gets an unappetizing dish with smears of food.   It's just an ok restaurant.<//Review>

We tried the cauliflower base pizzas the other day. They are really really tasty. More reminiscent of a flat bread than pizza dough, they have a nice texture and crunch. A tad sweet - but that works with the various topping combos they come in. I had roasted garlic, mushroom, and chicken. So good</Text>

Good place for a bite.  I believe it to be a bit pricey for what you get but that aside always a good meal.<//review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Worst service ever, we went there today with my Grandmother,  she ordered a her food (salad) without corn (diet restriction)  after waiting for more than 30 min they brought our food . Her salad with corn on it, my spaghetti under cooked and  shrimp were cold. The guy that was taking our orders just told us “sorry, why you didn’t said anything before” we told him before but he didn’t do anything about it. They didn’t offer to change her salad, we just paid our bill and came home better.
Well probably that guy was busy or having a really bad day. But CPK you need to keep on eye on what the people ordered even more when they have restrictions on what they can and can not eat.< /Text>< gmapID>

Had a good  lunch there.  The chicken club was yummy. The Caesar salad was fine. Nice chunks of parmesan cheese but hardly any dressing and not tossed! Service was outstanding. My son had a lunch pizza and they were kind enough to make his favorite Hawaiian although not usually made in that size.  Great iced tea too and I'm very picky about that.<//review>

<Review>My dinner home away from home! I love this place, the people and the food! They need to work on their drink game a little (alcoholic). The mixed drinks are always a little weak (compared to other CPKs I go to) and the staff often seems to be lacking in the knowledge of their custom alcoholic beverages as they are not consistent in their flavors. Not a huge deal or a deal breaker, but an honest review is an honest review.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Rating>

To be honest I have never tried their food, I only picked up food for delivery from them , I will actually try their food soon, I just hadn’t have chance recently, but I am giving them five stars for their well organized place and their professional team, as I saw on their menus they serve pastas and some grills and salads beside the pizza of course, some times I feel like their yellowish theme reminds me the Hawkeyes in Iowa city , maybe that’s why I feel the place is comfortable to me , lastly, yes I haven’t tried their food yet but I smelled it a lot, it’s definitely Yaaaaameeeeeee 😂😂😂<//Text>

One of my favorite places to go for lunch with friends or dinner with the family! This CPK is one of my favorites because the owner is always around making sure everything goes right and checks with everyone to make sure everything is perfect. Clean and modern- they sort of recently remodeled and it looks great!< /review>

BEWARE.  I can't believe this restaurant hired RACIST employees. They humiliated me said as a ASIAN I'm not allowed to call the restaurant.

California pizza kitchen mission viejo is my night mare.
They always delay the orders. At first few times when i arrived  the restaurant, they didn't even place the order after the order was place 30 minutes ago, and they just tell me to wait there for another 30 minutes and they don't even sorry about it.

After these few times of pickup in this restaurant, I call them before I arrive to check if they got the order at the first place.

But the lady in charge of the takeouts told me that "you are not Allowed to call, you should just come in and wait for it" and hang up the phone.

And one day in the parking lot, she said to me: "do you know why we always delay your order? Because you are a fxxxing stupid Asian. you are nobody, why should I talk to you, you are just a delivery guy and no one cares about your feelings.< /Text>

<review>Great food, but over priced menu expect to pay about $30 pp without ordering from premiums meals therefore i didn't see value for money here, $3.50 for fountain soft drinks which way over priced for the market prices, i dont know what's wrong with these places they just want to rip you off as much as they can.</review><response>{'time': 1534529210934, 'text': 'Thank you for reaching out and sharing this feedback.
