< Review>
Ding Tea in Pomona is a very pleasant place to shop for tea. The location is clean. Their menu is diverse. The staff greeted me upon entering and waited patiently for me to choose my drinks. My wait time was reasonable and my drinks were done right. The tea temperature was perfect and the boba tasted fresh. I recommend this location and will take family and friends for delicious drinks.</Review>

<GmapID>0x80c32fae49dd4c03:0xa6298591dda44a96<//GmapID><review>I've tried the passion fruit green tea, mango black tea, and taro milk tea. I liked them all. Every time I visit a new place, I always try a taro milk tea. So far, I like theirs the best.

I think It's cool how you can adjust the sweetness and ice level. They have a variety of unique toppings too! I would recommend this place to anyone that likes milk tea and flavored teas<//review><rate>5< /rate><Response>{'time': 1532634282944, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your review.

<Review>I love this place. Super cute inside. Great hang out spot. They have board games & books. Power outlets so you can connect charger/laptop. Decorative wall to takes pictures.

Love the Matcha Green tea. This time had it with crystal boba, pretty good. I'm not into regular boba. The peeps are super chill & friendly. Have extended menu and very inexpensive. They have Vegan options.

They GrubHub! No Bill's over $20. They have a reward card- buy ten get one regular size free. Free parking in the shopping center (not gorgeous).< /Review>< Resp>

< Review>
Good drink selections specials in the afternoon. The atmosphere inside the business is what coffee and tea shops should be like it's not like a Starbucks with crazy chatter.prices are pretty reasonable. Different  selections of things to add in teas or smoothies. It's new good vibes and shouldn't be over looked. I dont consider this a dessert place , however the drinks they have are sweet. The staff friendly and helpful and its busy during lunch time.</Review>

They need to put a small note on the door on the East suite 103, redirect folks to west facing. The office is on the west side of the parking strip.<//Review>< Pictures>

Just wanted to take the time to write a review due to the incredible service I received from this location. I called in to get a quote for my vehicle and was quickly  attended by Diana Ramirez. She was very helpful with the different circumstances I was giving her regarding the coverage I wanted on my car. She explained what she could offer and even suggested better options for me, which she clarified with great detail.

Thanks again Diana!<//review>

We all know how calling insurance companies can be grueling with long hold times... that's never been the case with this office!  I am so happy I switched!  I always speak to Angela, who has been such a pleasure to work with.  She's patient, super sweet and makes me laugh too.  I always feel bad to call with so many questions but she never seems to mind. This girl is an absolute saint and has made this experience of switching our cars, life, and home insurances over such a breeze.  It's rare these days to get such quality customer service so I had to give a shout out.<//Review>

Absolutely the best.!! Words can not describe how thankful and amazed I am by the great service I received from Todd's office and his staff. Tanja Smith is just great.. i was having trouble with my lien provider sending my home insurance payment and all I had to do was mention it to her and she took care of everything. She called them many times and kept pushing them to do their part, after all her persistent effort she was able to get them to speed up the process and the payment came through. She was just awesome to deal with and did way more than I would have expected. Most agents would have told me to call the lien provider and get the payment,. But not her, she listen to me and figured everything out for me. I would definitely recommend her for any insurance needs. I hope to keep bringing her my business for years to come. They certainly have me as a loyal customer for a long-long time.<//Text>

It has been my pleasure for the past 12 years to be a client of State Farm and specifically working with Angela Hiatt. Angela and Todd Main have been there to answer all my questions and provide assistance in all aspects of my insurance needs.  The slogan they use is absolutely true, like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.  I would highly recommend you give Angela Hiatt a call, you will be more than happy you did.

I have been with State Farm since I was 16, and I must say that I am still with State farm because of AMAZING people like Angela H. who Todd brought to his family.  She goes the extra mile to ensure I had all my needs met for insurance and has been completely honest with me.  She answers questions in a timely manner and her follow up is exceptional.

We do our business liability insurance through Todd Main State Farm, and Angela is our agent. She is the best. By far the most personable, attentive, and professional insurance agent to date. We are looking into rolling all of our personal insurance over to State Farm. Angela is patient, will run quotes quickly, and answer any and all questions we have with grace. Highly recommend.< /Text>

I've had my policy through State Farm for a few years now and I couldn't be happier. Whenever I have a question or need help with my policy, Diana Ramirez helps me and provides great service while doing it. The coverage is great, the employees at the office offer great service and I feel covered at all times.</Review>

<Text>I have been a customer with the Todd Main State Farm office in Lancaster CA for several years now. I must say I have always received great service from my agent Angela Hiatt. She is always available to speak with me when I have a question about insurance coverage. She is very knowledgeable and a pleasure to speak with. As a customer you feel as if you are family when speaking with Angela. Ask for Angela when you call there office, you will not be disappointed.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

I had the best experience over the phone with Angela. Not only was she kind and patient  about the handful of questions I had about life insurance policies, she made sure I understood all my options. Thank you Angela, look forward to talking to you soon!<//Review>

My experience with Johhny Ruiz here at this office has been great! I'm new to being a home owner and all my questions have been answered and Johnny really made sure that I understood how everything worked. Also, what was quoted has been the best so far. Will be seeing Johnny again for the rest of  insurances!! Thank you Johnny!!</Review>

I was so happy to get my Car insurance back with State Farm. I know the importance of having reliable insurance and so with the help of Johnny Ruiz I was able to not only come back to State Farm, but I was able to get a multi line discount with my life and renter's insurance. Johnny was very attentive and made sure to follow up with me while reworking my quote to fit my needs.

Thanks Johnny!</review>

I saw Diana, she was patient and very helpful. I had a policy already and she explained the differences and took her time to explain how I could save money in the long run with them. She was highly knowledgeable. I highly recommend her!< /Text>

I had the awesome experience of working with Angela Hiatt to refinance my RV with through State Farm. The office was in a convenient location and everyone there was very friendly and welcoming.
Angela herself was a pleasure to work with and explained everything in an easy to understand manner. If you want someone who is knowledge, friendly, has a sense of humor, and responds in a timely manner then Angela is definitely who you should go to.<//Text>

I would like to thank Johnny Ruiz for helping me with my Home Owners Insurance. Johnny was both very helpful and informative with explaining the coverage that was being provided. I appreciate his genuine care that I was taken care of by Todd Main State Farm Insurance. I will definitely recommend State Farm to my friends and family.</Review>

Buying a house and finding the right insurance agent is not an easy thing to do. Angela Hiatt changed all that. She took away all my stress, always answered all of my questions no matter how ridiculous they might be. Got more coverage too for the same amount every other company was asking for. She is a rare jewel in the insurance world. What an amazing experience. Now have my home and cars all through her.</review>

This is the best insurance office in Lancaster. They are very knowledgeable and welcoming. Yesse is bilingual and was able to help my mom with her home and auto insurance. I will be sending the rest of my family to Todd's office for sure.<//Review>

<Name>s< /Name><text>I bought my house in Lancaster and needed to have it insured asap. Coming from LA I didn't know the area. I walked into the nearest office  which happened to be Mr. Main's office. The team was very welcoming. Yesse provided me with the quote I needed and broke down how I'm protected. She then quoted my auto and was able to get my Home ins rate a discount. I walked out of this office with my home and auto protected and my life insured. Should anything happen to me, my wife can pay off our home and I can leave her and my son money to get by for a while. I am forever grateful.< /text><Time>1504114703309<//Time>< UserId.>

<text>Angela was so wonderful and helpful with out state - to- state transfer of our policies from Chicago to Lancaster. Because the leasing office for our new apartment needed the renters insurance to reflect our new address immediately and my old StateFarm agent's office had closed for the day, I had to update my renters insurance through StateFarm's customer service hotline. They then said they would transfer my auto policy to Todd Main's office to complete the state-to-state transfer. That ended up complicating things and delaying the process a bit. Angela reached out to me, straightened everything out, and kept me updated every step of the way. I'm glad to have them as my new StateFarm agents!</text>< response>

Todd Main has been my insurance agent for the past 2 years and I've been satified with the service provided by him and his staff! Yesenia, has always gone above and beyond to fulfill what customer service means! I always recommend them to my friends and family when searching for a new insurance agent!< /Text>

<review>Contacted State Farm for a car insurance quote spoke with agent Yessenia Umana who is an amazing sells representative. I let her know what I was looking for and the price I was looking to spend. She did lots of research to help me meet my price. She explained so well all the benefits that would be included and also quoted me life insurance rates. She let me know if I bundled my rates could be lower. I really appreciated all her time and patience she really made me feel comfortable with being insured with State Farm and once I'm ready I will be contacting her back directly. Thanks so much Yessenia Umana u are a true asset to that company.

Atwater Starbucks on Bell has rude employees who talk down to you when your trying to ask a question. Had a question about a drink and she immediately gave an attitude, then she asked if I was done and shut the window. I will not mention the persons name but I will be filling a complaint. I will be going to a different Starbucks from now on.< /text>

<Review>This particular store has always been slow.  So, I put in an on line order to pick up in the store.  When I got there, they locked the door (11:00 am).  Left me standing there.  I called, and was told to either get in the drive thru, which was about a 45 minute wait, or call the 800 number for a refund.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

enforcing masks has become such an ignorant  practice, not only that, their own employee wasn't wearing one the day of my visit.  Bringing tables and chairs in 30 minutes before closing using COVID-19 as an excuse to close early.  Every other business lately has been making their own rules.  Shame !</review>

I enjoy a skinny, vanilla sugar free hot latte. This Starbucks I go to if I'm picking up a drink and leaving. Can't find seating inside because there are UC or college young adults taking up the seats. Which is fine because I know this and I know I will not be staying there to enjoy my drink.<//review>

Just ordered my Nitro cold brew for $4.45 and explained to the  barista to please not over foam it. However they still proceeded to tell me the foam will dissolve to coffee which it did not waiting 45mins later for it settle. So in all reality I paid $4.45 for a $3.75 cup of coffee. Customer is right on this one. Don't play with my coffee in the morning and please give me what I paid for...</Text>

<Text>Stopped here to use the facilities. They were clean and fully stocked with tp and paper towels. I stood there looking confused and the barista asked me what sounded good. I asked if the strawberry frappuccino had caffeine. She said no, but during Valentine's day they had a special strawberry chocolate coffee drink. So, I ordered that and it was the yummiest drink I've ever had at Starbucks. Got my caffeine fix and had a pleasant interaction with a kind, knowledgable employee.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I have had mostly good times here but last couple times have been the worst. Bad service and got my orders wrong. I told them that they got my order wrong but they said that I had got it wrong. I looked at the sticker and my mobile receipt and told them that it was clearly wrong. But they still didn't understand anything I was saying. Then the last visit (tonight), I had told them it was wrong but once again..."I was wrong". I didn't want to argue so I just left and probably won't be going back again. Sad because I liked this place.</Text>

The staff was really great and we got our food and drinks promptly with friendly service. It was a little off-putting to have the manager conducting a disciplinary meeting with an employee at a table. She was very loud and the employee left in tears. Not very professional and due to the loud conversation it was impossible to not hear. Maybe a back room would have been more appropriate? Also lots of flies inside!</Review>

They have multiple baristas working at this location but it seems like a few only are standing around. It took them 15 minutes to a black tea lemonade. It would be nice to have more than one barista make the drinks. The drive thru barista was moving but the other 4 were at a snails pace and they messed up my drink, definitely avoid this location and go across town or the one inside Target.</text>

It took me 15 minutes to get a one tall Americano the store was empty no one was in front of me no one was behind me, there was only two people setting on their laptops in the store, restrooms were not clean. I waited around 7 minutes until one of the employees was done cleaning and brewing coffee to take my order.< /Text>

Ordered a mango dragonfruit lemonade but they were all out of fruit for it so they said they would add a scoop of strawberries instead. Receive my drink and there are no strawberries only blackberries. I taste it and there is no lemonade in it at all. I can’t be sure but it seemed like it wasn’t a mango dragonfruit at all and was instead a very berry hibiscus. Typically great service today was just an off day perhaps</Text>

I have to say I don't often like to visit the trendy, hip, chain coffee stores, just because I am not a trendy, hip person. That said, I am always lured to Starbucks in the wintertime with their wonderful blends of hot drinks. After visiting one of the founding stores in Seattle and discovering Salted Caramel Hot Chocolate, I find myself craving one (ok maybe 10) once the cool, rainy weather gets here. The Chowchilla store is somewhat small, likely do to the space they took over, but it has such a warm, comfy, atmosphere, I would like to see their space expand.<//text>

I go to this Starbucks every morning on my way to work and I order the same exact drink every single morning.  a London fog tea latte.  My drink is wrong at least 3 days a week.  I've talked to them to see if I should be ordering my drink a different way so that it gets made right. They assure me I'm ordering right but then half the time it's wrong! My drink is too hot to try until I'm already at work and then I'm just stuck with it. It really puts a damper on your day when the drink that's suppose to get you going for the day isn't what you paid for.<//text>

<Review>I ordered my drink and food. I requested the vanilla syrup swaps into pumpkin syrup instead. Once the drink was ready, I noticed the sticker listed for no vanilla and I did not see any pumpkin syrup as I requested. I asked the barista if she did put the pumpkin spice syrup. She said no. It wasn't even listed. I told her that I requested that at the cashier. (I read body language for skills.) She was very annoyed, not even once smiled when I smiled to thank her. Everyone behind seemed not so greeting except the cashier. I forgive him for not listing what I requested.
I got my replacement drink, it wads sloppy and didn't fulfill what I ordered.< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp><UserId.>112033503588923071775<//UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Lexi was extremely rude, she got my order wrong 3x. It was only one drink. she was too busy talking to other people in there to listen to my order and get it right. she kept saying "hold on" which I don't understand why if I had just the one drink but when I pulled up to the window it was clear what was happening. when I pulled up to the window she was taking the order of the person behind me and kept asking him to "hold on" so she could talk and laugh with her friend some more. she used the most sarcastic and rude tone, when I asked for her name she said "mine? why?" all in all didn t appreciate the service at all. funny how one person can ruin a whole experience.</review>

This Starbucks it's a Starbucks. If you have never been to a Starbucks I wonder how that's possible. Even someone who tries to avoid Starbucks can't avoid Starbucks. This Starbucks also just like every other Starbucks.<//review>

This location never gets our order right....drive thru is faster than ordering inside. Twice the staff was too busy talking to each other and ignored us while waiting to order. 😢<//review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The truth of coffee is not a very clean and excellent place to have a good time and the whole thing with a family friend or friend or some conquest boyfriend or girlfriend etc. What I call too much attention of the site is the way to attend I do not know if it was only in that branch but there was a girl of about 17 or 15 years excellent service the truth the way he attended to me I fell in love to return to the place the truth was too night and at that time anyone saw me answered in a way particular but that girl really loved it with all the enthusiasm

(Original)
La verdad del café no hablo es un excelente lugar muy limpio y excelente para pasar un buen rato y toda la cosa con algún familiar amiga o amigo o alguna conquista novio o novia etc lo que me llamo demasiado la atención del sitio es la forma de atender no se si sólo era en esa sucursal pero había una chica de alrededor de unos 17 o 15 años excelente servicio la verdad la forma como me atendía me enamoro de volver al lugar la verdad era demasiado noche y ha esas hora cualquiera me viera contes5ado de forma particular pero esa chica enserio con todo el entusiasmo me encantó<//Review>< pictures>

My favorite place to watch airplanes landing and take a break from the computer.  If you work in this park, there is a Foosball table, ping pong table, game room, corn hole on the green, eating area with umbrellas...< /text>

This is a business park, not a shopping mall. Food truck Fridays are cool though.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Stop here and go to Agora to enjoy Brazilian cuisine. The first thing you should think of is "Churrascaria Brazilian kiln grilling?"
Agora Churrascaria has a magnificent appearance made of river stone and wood. When you walk into the restaurant, the high patio allows the sunlight to reach the interior, making the rustic stone walls look warm. The neutral tones of brown and white make you feel very comfortable.
ㄧ A very unique, interesting, and full meal. When you come here, you will definitely let you think and get better than you expect! Great meal at least once!
I accidentally discovered a Japanese restaurant "Makino" diagonally across the street. My favorite food is Japanese food. Come back next time!

(Original)
到這兒停車，去Agora享用巴西料理，大家最先想到的應該就是 「Churrascaria 巴西窯烤」了吧?!
Agora Churrascaria 有著河石與木頭建構的壯闊外觀，走進餐廳，高聳的天井讓陽光照近室內，讓質樸的石頭牆面顯得溫暖，棕色、白色系的中性色調令人感覺非常舒適。
ㄧ個很獨特的、有趣的、吃的很飽的一頓大餐，來到這裡，絕對讓您所想的、得到的，要比您所預料的好！很棒的一餐至少要經歷一次！
無意間發現了斜對面有家日本料理餐廳「Makino 」，最喜愛吃日本料理food，下回再來吃囉！<//Text>

Great dive bars with stiff drinks and a really cool outdoor area since Covid. Check them out - great outdoor area with the coolest mural and fun DJ (80’s music woohoo) on the weekend

Happy Hour 5-7pm every weekend since no one actually puts the damn time when they review Happy Hour<//review>

Fun, causal with that highland Park artsy hipster vibe, LGBT friendly, variety of entertainment, and fairy priced drinks.

Went to the drink and drag Monday show. Host was awesome. Delightfully Dirty, creative, sassy and delectably themed. Different from other drag shows. Highly recommend.</Text>

Tons of meat options, great especially for a fellow meat lover watching the waiters come around with swords full of meat. The meat was tender and the selection of vegetables and cheeses are also great as well. Weird comment, but the water is also very good. Great for larger parties. I believe I went during Dine LA and we got a small deal which was nice (I want to say it was $10 off from the original price?). Parking is available but you'll have to pay.<//Review>

Super divey and hipster bar! Was in town visiting family and my cousin suggested this place. It's super casual and they have a really fun shuffleboard table! We ordered some beers and cocktails, but the best part were the free pretzels! How many bars offer free ANYTHING  (besides water)?! Bartenders are super chill and not obnoxious at all. We also ordered the dolma as a snack and they were delicious. The music was mostly throwbacks which are really fun to sing along to when you're buzzing! Overall, I'm a fan and I'm glad that we came here.< /review>

My favorite dive bar! People are cool, staff are super friendly, drinks are tasty and they have like snack foods for sale. (Cash for the food)! I like the decor, there's a camper design which is cool and just a bunch of stuff for decorations. Sunday looks like karaoke night since we went again but this time on a Sunday. Good crowd you can definitely have fun here!!< /text>

My girlfriend is moving to Puerto Rico and had her going away get together there. I must say that this location is amazing. Scott the owner is a very humble and friendly man. We were able to get pizza from the place across the street which was super yummy. They also had a live acoustic guitarist playing. Overall its a very hospitable place. I will definitely be back more than a few times.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

The spot. Nuff said.
I've been here longer than the bar itself, And they have done a great job cleaning up the disaster that was "penthouse billiards". This place has it all but liquor(which I don't care for anyway)
Could be cheaper though. But low key worth it. Get some beer you won't find anywhere else in Hollywood.</review>

We wanted a nice Sunday lunch in Montrose and were looking for a dog-friendly place.  We were delighted with the service and they fawned over our pooch as if she were there own!  Somewhat limited lunch menu for a Sunday afternoon, but the food and service were great.  Patio seating with our dog and the friendly service made this a special place!</review>

Haha I don't even drink, but I love The Offbeat . Why? Because I love to dance. And The Offbeat is a nice place to dance. No, there's no real dance floor except in front of the bar and DJ, but the music does get going (at least on Thursday/Friday nights, not sure about others) and people do get moving.<//review>

<Review>This is a neat bar where Bass Waffles has their events, and it has a free cover, and they serve waffles, but be sure to tip your waffle maker! The shows are once a month, on Sundays, and are always a lot of fun. The same people who throw Bass Waffles, also have shows called Mutate, in LA. Be sure to check them out!!< /Review>< resp>

Karaoke DJ skips and ignores people if he doesn't like your song or wants to play his friends' songs or whatever reason. I put in my song about 3 spots behind my friends. After they sang their songs, I waited an hour and my song never came up. When I finally asked the DJ, he said he "didn't get to me yet". Then I waited another half hour before giving up and leaving. Total waste of time for no reason.

Otherwise it's a solid bar.< /text>

Nice little spot. Went on an 80's night and although music was 80's I heard the same song more than 4 times. More of a knock on The DJ I guess. Place was nice, could use some cleaning and some attention to decor, but nice neighborhood dive bar.< /Review>

<Text>Not gonna be a trendy hipster cocktail bar option, but The Offbeat has an edgy quality that boosts it above a dive. We were there apparently between live acts, so your mileage may vary significantly. Good variety of beer and cocktails, nothing super high-end but a few things of interest. Decor includes red barstools and art deco clocks. Not much around this spot in terms of nightlife, good option if you find yourself nearby.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Hit and miss, but a cool place. Can be a bit loud, but it is meant for dancing. Always seems to peak around midnight.<//Text>

Finally made our way to The Offbeat.  We had a nice mix of happy hour items and regular menu items. The standouts were the brisket tacos, and the table side guacamole, I would skip the bacon in it though.

Nice prices on beers for happy hour ~$5.50 and great Mezcal selection.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

<rate>5< /rate><review>My favorite local spot for a drink. Each night of the week has a different theme (80's night, drag night, etc) or live music. Bar seating, table seating, lounge-like seating. Thursday night is taco night! Sometimes they have movies playing on the wall, and the ambiance and drinks are great. It's very dark, and often very loud, so make sure that's your thing.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This fun neighborhood bar is a little off the Highland Park stretch.  It's not quite on the York or Figueroa crawl path, which makes it unique.  The patrons are generally from the area, so you're not getting as much of the West Hollywood crowd that the bowling alley has drawn to the York stretch.  Reasonably priced drinks and good servers.  Check the website: there's a lot of cool events, and often some dancing.<//review>

It's an OK karaoke option in the area. Our group came on a Saturday night and we snagged the last small room available, which was $38/hr. Call before coming to check for availability.</Text>

Fantastic drinks. At first I thought the concept was cheesy. The cocktails though definitely live up to their accolades. Menu is perfect for a light meal. If u have your doubts, try it once & you will not be disappointed. The alley entrance adds to the ambiance. Also a good use of space for Los Angeles City!< /Review>

<Text>Love this place,but love more on Thursdays,Fridays,Saturday it draws a  big crowd sometimes it get too pack  but it's a great place to go and no cover charge. There is different theme every day. ( Like the saying goes to each it's own) so drop by and take a look at the daily theme calander at the bar and choose your day to go on,promise you may or may not like it but all Bar workers and people are all awesome.< /Text>< pics>

Started coming here because of Monday night drag shows.  Checked out Thursday's 80's nights (with free tacos!) and fell in love.  Live bands, awesome djs, and great bartenders. Can't praise this place more.< /Text>

I went yesterday, which was a Saturday night, with some friends. The bouncer reaked of liquor and was swaying back and forth while checking our IDs. After staring at them for a questionable length of time, he began asking us when our birthdays were, then our street address, then the zipcode, and STILL denied us entry! I get it, we're Asian and we look younger than we actually are so it's normal for people to look at our ID a little bit harder. But if you're going to allow your bouncer to be drunk, give him a UV light so that he can actually check if IDs are fake or not, but at the very least, give that man a cup of water.<//text>

I went on a Friday night and it was packed but the majority of the people leaving were saying that it was boring and going to Pasadena instead. I went inside and I was there for only 15 and I also decided to leave. I don't recommend this location to anyone.</review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Rated one of the top 10 spa's in California and I can see why!

I chose Kelly's signature youth spa package.  I had a soothing grape seed bubble bath and then went into a Swedish deep tissue massage.  My therapist Sydney was awesome!  She really worked on my shoulders.  Not only was she strong but she has a great spirit.  I connected with her immediately and instead of falling asleep I was screaming with laughter!  It was one of the best experiences I've ever had while getting a massage!

I ended with a Chardonnay scrub and a foot massage.  I felt so refreshed when I was done.  Of course I didn't want to leave and went back to the eucalyptus steam room for another 15 minutes!

The customer service was so good I bought face cleanser and I never even had a facial!

I would compare this spa to the Sonoma Mission Inn!  Top of the line service, products and environment!< /Review>< Pics>

I absolutely love this place wish I could afford a membership but for now I only do my birthday or treat someone on their birthday.  I have been to other places but so far nothing compares to Kelly Spa at the Mission Inn.< /text>< pics>

<Text>I loved it here... I spent the day with my girlfriends by the pool lounging. I got the aromatherapy massage. You must be here before you appointment time. If you get her at 12:05 takes you 15 mins from valet to sign in change that takes up you appt time "your massage "..  So get here early. The Las campana restaurant is lovely. They let you order your sushi and bring it outdoors. The chicken mole is delicious.

You definitely receive what you pay for. From the moment you walk in, to the moment you float out you are not only in constant awe at the beautiful artwork everywhere but are treated like stars. The retreat rooms really make you feel at home and the baths are an escape from reality into a relaxing dream where you're the star of your own fairytale. The massages are second to none and completely customized to suit your preferences. Even the music and atmosphere are tailored to your liking. And after you're done, you're free to linger a little while longer in your fairytale as you relax in the lounges, disappear into the clouds of the eucalyptus steam escapes or sun bathe by the crystal waters of the hotel pool. This is definitely a place worth coming to again and again, for any occasion.</Review>

<date>1581985011308< /date><Rating>4< /Rating><Text>My husband and I come every year for our anniversary for a couple's massage and it is amazing. It is a bit pricey but usually worth it. We make a day of it relaxing by the pool and enjoying the jacuzzi. I just wish they has a private pool/jacuzzi,  as there are often children jumping and splashing around in the jacuzzi.  But the other amenities are excellent and relaxing. The staff are attentive and friendly.< /Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

My experience here was amazing. All of the staff were so friendly and helpful. The massage was incredible, the pedicure left my feet so soft and the robes were so cozy. I can't wait to come back and enjoy another spa day.</text>

Wow! So glad my husband surprised me with a couples massage for my birthday. This spa is absolutely gorgeous. Really amazing decor and customer service. It definitely has the ‘wow’ factor. Great place to host a party! The robes and slippers are wonderful. The robe is super soft on the inside with a satiny type fabric on the outside-my favorite.

The couples massage room was spacious and cozy. We didn’t want to leave. I had a relaxing massage with Jasmine. My husband had a deep tissue/sports medicine style massage with LaJuan. He said that the massage was very intense, but he felt so much better afterwards and would go back. So if you like more pressure/intensity, ask for LaJuan. Jasmine is definitely a better therapist if you want something that makes you feel relaxed and drowsy.

The waiting rooms were beautiful. We received complimentary champagne and chocolate. They also had tea, water, fruit, and gingerbread cookies!

Only negative would be the women’s lounge. It is small with only two sinks to get ready. And it gets super hot with the steam room and hair dryers. It was 78 degrees and I was super warm.

Overall, loved this spa. Planning on going with my mom and one of my friends in the future! Great value, great experience.</review>

Love this place, just watch out for the extra crowd in May and December.   Still, a very lovely place to relax...just one tip:  If you must talk, please be kind to your neighbors and keep the volume low so the rest can relax 😉<//Review>

Great staff and services provided - 5 stars. The facility - 1 star. The women's sauna not working, only one shower in the men's locker room working, and the shower in our cabana not working.<//review>

<text>Hubby got me a gift card, wow, so glad he did! I had a facial, scalp treatment, and a pedicure. All were very wonderful. The atmosphere is very luxurious and calming. Fresh fruit, tea, beverages in the lounge area. Use of the spa and pool as well with your visit. I felt comfortable and pampered from the moment I walked in! Can't wait to come back.</text></record>

<Text>“The best way to spend a day.”
A spa day that last the whole day. Using one of their packages, I took a friend and "celebrated connections". Not my first visit, but just as wonderful as I remembered. Not only are their therapists well qualified, all the staff is just there to help and pamper. No pressure to buy anything, very low key and restful.

< Review>
I was a guest first at the Mission Inn Hotel and Spa and then I worked there as the Director of Sales and Marketing.  I can tell you that the plumbing in my room was scary.  I never knew if the toilet would flush or not and I would be stuck in the bathroom with an overflowing toilet.  As for the restaurants, the food was good except for their Mexican restaurant, which was the worst food and service that I have ever encountered.  Actually, to be quite honest the soup was disgusting!  The drinks were made with powdered mixes and not like what I have encountered with real, delicious ingredients like in New Orleans where I am from.  Don't let the Mission that began as a Catholic Mission fool you if you are seeking to experience history.  Their is a gigantic Buddha on property and the Catholic Church is closed for services on property.  They  have silenced real history at this hotel with paganism. As for my job, my faith was detested and my whistle blowing as well.  They dug and dug until they found something on me and then fired me.  What followed was the entire executive staff being fired one by one.  They have more turnover there than a 24/7 Ferris-wheel.  Lastly, they seemed to be very discriminating to me.  The Roberts who own the hotel are die-hard Republicans and they are TRUMP supporters.  Watch out! The spa performed illegal procedures while I was there and they were sued.< /Review>

This review in no way reflects my massage therapist. She was great, professional, and kind. Unfortunately, I am bad with remembering names, so she will go down as a 5 Star unsung hero....

The 3 star is for the spa itself. While everything was fine and harmonious and all that, i just didn't love this spa. I guess I am spoiled with my first spa experience being the Four Seasons in Westlake Village.  Kelly's Spa is located in the historic Mission Inn, in downtown Riverside.  The entrance to the spa was actually really pleasant, i think they have some type of scent generator outside haha.

Once in, the check in area is a little small, but very peaceful, and loaded with merch. The staff is super friendly. My real  gripes with this place are:
The size. It is small and you just don't feel free.
Not a fan of the co-ed waiting area.
The steam room was luke warm
The showers are small and there are only 2
The positives are the price. While it is small, there are full amenities. Even with my 25 minute massage i was offered champagne. The staff is
the other great thing here. Every person i encountered was super friendly.

I do recommend this spa though. It wasn't bad, I'm just a dick.

Until next time...< /Review>

<review>Lack luster spa treatments. Had a body wrap that led me to believe I was being punked. Over priced. Kelly Roberts needs to woman up and get more involved with a spa that holds her name. The entire hotel is slowly going downhill while there seems to be no change in sight.  Cheap mattresses, The HideAway across the street waking you up at all hours, horrible food at every single restaurant associated with the hotel,  When we think of The Mission Inn now..."Meh, let's go somewhere else."  Kelly that's what you're associated with....cheap mattresses.  Gross.</review>< pics>

I'll tell you what boy, this pizza slaps harder than the two twelves subs in the back of my car's trunk. This is best pizza in the valley. Rich flavors and fresh ingredients. I recommend everyone to check this place out. 5 Stars for sure! 🤙</Review>

Ordered delivery. Was told 50-60 minutes. I called after 80 minutes and they had not even started making my order. Person on phone was very rude and disrespectful. DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT. In times like these it’s customer service that will save a business. Let the Red Baron crash!!<//Review>

<review>Red Baron would not deliver to us at hesperia lake because we were going to pay with a debit card. You lost our business. We will never order from you again. In this day and age not to many people carry cash. But your competition was more then happy to take our card. When you first answered the phone, the first thing I asked you is do you deliver to the lake and you said yes. Then you proceeded to ask my order. Gave me the whole spill on your specials. You asked me then for cash or card and I said card, all of a sudden you can't take my order. Horrible customer service. Bye bye...Mama Mia Pizza....thank you for your service. You will def get my business from now on<//review>< UserId.>

< Review>
The five stars are for the sauce alone!! The people are nice too. I have ordered a few different things and the sauce always makes me slam my fork on the plate!! I ordered the lasagna for the first time ( delivery driver asked if it was good) OMG the best lasagna ever... Better than my mom's!!! Oh the driver is super nice, she learned my little guard dog's name and greats her. I had a hiccup once over some patato wedges but that wasn't enough to remove a star from the rating. We have not ordered/picked up/eaten from any other pizza place since first trying Red Baron!!<//Review>

Placed a pickup order very simple one large 3 topping they got the toppings wrong and once I was there to pick him up the guy looks at me like like it was my fault I got to pay for it. And there's nothing he can do on his end it's a pizza just remake it. The problem is he's too much in a hurry and he's not listening to the order.< /text>

<date>1626924987710<//date><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>Very very disappointing. We booked two goats for Eid-ul-Adha 2021, we were told to stop by 1PM, when we reached there by 1.30PM meat was not ready. Then they started to make pieces and literally it was the worst cutting I have ever seen in my life. Every single piece was bigger than 10 inches. I asked thrice for doing weight but they said machine was not working.</Text>< pics>

Nizam and Abdul Rahman are two exceptional individuals. They are humble and have the utmost highest level of integrity. I have known them all my life and they have been nothing but good to their community. 10/10 recommend their services.</Review>

Amazing facility and service! I called Nizam, he answered all my questions and texted me the pictures of the goats that I was interested in. Went there and was done with everything within 40 mins. Best halal slaughterhouse that I saw up to now which is open to public.</review>

This place is the must humane facility i have ever visited. The animals are treated with great care I was beyond impressed. The quality was amazing for the price.

There are a lot of comments talking about murder on here. Ignore those comments as they are not even remotely true. Zabeeha farms has humane and quality meat at low prices< /text>

Excellent family run business serving communities with a smile, humanely slaughtered meats - which tastes great and it is fairly priced, and a facility that is clean, growing and on the way to new heights.

Thank you for your service.</Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) An official and authorized slaughterhouse has sheep, goats and goats slaughtered, and prices are in pounds
Whereas, after selecting the carcass and skinning it, 9 dollars per pound is calculated
The staff are friendly and treat them professionally, I would recommend them

(Original)
مسلخ رسمي ومصرح وعنده ذبايح خرفان وتيوس وماعز وأسعار بالباوند
حيث انه بعد اختيار الذبيحه وسلخها يتم حساب ٩ دولار لكل باوند
الموظفين ودودين وتعاملهم احترافي ،، انصح بهم👍🏼</Review>< UserId.>

<resp>{'time': 1548084849811, 'text': 'Thanks for taking the time to get information on our Establishment. However, I wish you’d be more honest and sincere by actually getting to know who we are and what makes us unique, rather than leaving a 1-Star review based on ignorance and prejudice. I hate getting these reviews from people like you who love to act like they know what we do here, but don’t have the decency to come and see for themselves. But then again, the name says it all: the_godless_vegan. Someone who doesn’t worship The Almighty Creator, surely worships their own desires.\n\nThat being said, I respect vegans and atheists, as much as I disagree with them. As for vegans, I agree that the issues related to how animals are harvested commercially, is beyond unacceptable. However, Zabeeha Farms is unique and maintains quality care of animals upon receiving and slaughter. As for the Atheists, I have respect for them to go as far as they have: knowing that the Judeo-Christian concept of a Man-God is irrational and impossible. However, Islam is free from such a form of blasphemy and is based upon rationality and free thought, without the church trying to get involved, as is the case with Christianity.\n\nI welcome you and those like you to come learn about our faith: Islam and why we slaughter the way we do. We religiously harvest our animals by first walking them in a dignified manner to the place of slaughter. We don’t beat them or drag them. Secondly, we don’t kill animals in front of each other, rather we do them one at a time, cleaning the entire area before the next animal is brought in. Thirdly, hand-slaughter each animal to assure quality and precision, while blessing it in the name of the Creator. We use razor sharp knives that immediately bleed the animals, which renders the animal senseless to pain, as experts like Dr. Temple Gradin states in her studies. Lastly, we do this process as a religious obligation and a form of worship. The One and Only God, Allah created us and the animals for us to harvest like the vegetables and crops. However, they are to be done as per His commandments. That is what defines Zabeeha Farms: Meat prepared in Accordance to the Divine Laws of the Creator.\n\nPlease don’t hesitate to call, email, or message me to set up and appointment to see who we really are. I ask Allah to bless us all and to show us the straight path that leads to his pleasure. Ameen.'}<//resp><date>1548081941737<//date></record>

Best place in the valley for crossfit.  Instructor lead classes from 5am-830p classes available. Very challenging if you want to open your inner competitor.  Positive atmosphere, encouraging staff and all classes go over movements with possible scale downs</Text>

Once covid hit and all the gyms closed, I wasn’t sure what I was going to do. A friend recommended a couple of CrossFit gyms and advised me to do my research. I chose VCF due to being so close to my house, but endeavors up signing with them due to everything else. I’m Mo pro so I need patience and I need to be held accountable. The coaches, the athletes, the activities... I couldn’t have made a better decision. Once COVID ends, these poor folks are still going to be stuck with me. VCF, I’m hoooomme! 🖤</review>

<Text>I decided to try CrossFit out for the first time at this gym and it has completely exceeded all of my expectations. The gym is always clean and organized. There are many classes throughout the day; the classes are tough, but not impossible to get through. Every coach is patient and knowledgeable and they take the time to teach you and make sure you are doing the exercise correctly. Valley CrossFit is a great gym with awesome coaches and members.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Valley Crossfit
PROS: Lots of time options for classes, specialty classes, big and spacious with professional, well maintained equipment, spring floor, Big parking lot, community atmosphere, knowledgeable and friendly staff

CONS: Some classes can get full, can become addicting.

At the End Of January 2017, I had a Facebook ad show up about a  six week fitness challenge offered by Valley Crossfit (VCF) I work a 9-5 behind a computer screen and really wanted to make a positive
change .

Having never tried Crossfit, I was a worried about feeling like a deuce walking into a gym, somewhere I never go. I signed up.  From the start the staff and coaches made me feel like I was part of the team and never judgemental. it was tough but fun and challenges you to become a better version of yourself.

The coaches will scale workouts according to your ability and keep you motivated. Communication via the Facebook group really helps you stay connected, ask questions, get answers and gives the community feeling validity. I signed up for a regular membership after finishing the challenge and I couldn't be happier.

All of the same feelings apply and are not exclusive to the six week challenge.  Valley Crossfit has been the cornerstone of Motivation and Positive Change.

Highly recommended for anyone looking for a place to get in shape in a welcoming environment without judgment and an attentive professional staff.
See ya there soon, come say hi.</Review>

Loved the challenging 5:30 am group workout! I thought I was in good shape, but this workout humbled me. Even more impressive was the friendliness of the trainer and people in the class. Although I was in Van Nuys for a short trip, everyone made me feel like I was family. Highly recommend Valley CrossFit!< /Review>

Valley Crossfit was incredibly inviting, very detailed and engaged with the instructions for the WOD and the WOD was kickass!!! Not only that, the entire social environment was encouraging and motivating. So go to Valley Crossfit! Unless you want to be fat with no friend, then don’t go!</review>

I've tried several crossfit boxes in the valley.  This is by far the best one yet.  There's a bunch of different classes you can take; starting from beginners to more advanced.  They know what they are doing.  All that is needed is commitment.< /Review>

The space and vast variety of equipment (spring floor, ropes, yokes, walls, stones, sand bags, 2 large rigs, assault bikes, rowers, ski ergs, etc) don't compare to anywhere else.  The coaches and community encourage and push you past what you ever thought possible.  It's a place to get fit, makes friends, conquer fears, and learn and grow in fitness and in life.<//review>

<Review>All are welcome here, no matter where you are in your fitness journey or what your goals are (competing, fitness, longevity). The staff is awesome and knowledgeable, and the facility has all the space and many fun toys to learn about and use in your fitness (my fav is the spring floor to practice gymnastics ;D).< /Review>< username>

Valley Crossfit has been a game changer for me. As a busy working mom, I needed to find something that would be a great workout in the shortest amount of time. I didn't expect how much I would actually love it! The fitness is amazing and the community is so supportive and non-threatening! I was intimidated at first but they truly meet you where you are - everything is scaled to your fitness level and every coach is super skilled and really cares. I'm so glad I started with the 6 Week Challenge - definitely the way to go if you're a newbie. Can't say enough good things. It's changed my life!< /Text>

The vibe here is super welcoming and fun. Other places I've been feel impersonal like I'm just a number, or too strict like a drill sergeant, but not here. The coaches do want to see you succeed and like to push you to your relative limits, but I always feel safe in their depth of knowledge and that quality of movement is more valuable than just getting a high score. I'm constantly impressed by how accommodating they are for other members with physical limitations whether due to age, height, weight, strength, skill, injury, etc. They're very good at scaling things to appropriately suit  your circumstances, while still getting in a really good workout. It's so exciting to conquer new skills and add them to my repertoire. And the best part is, they have different classes other than just Crossfit. With specialty classes like cardio, mobilization, lifting, gymnastics, and a 101 class for beginners, it's pretty hard not to find what your looking for.</review><resp>None</resp><date>1496037612641< /date><userid>116794028849856097429<//userid><username>Brian Orosco</username></record>

<Review>I went into Valley CrossFit’s 6-week Foundations program with the goal of losing 10lbs. What I got out of it was so much more.

The program is FANTASTIC! Not only do you learn the proper form & technique of doing the exercises, but in every class, they discuss how to improve your overall health & fitness outside of working out (The WORDZ). I learned the importance of diet, nutrition (No Sugar, No Wheat & Grains and no Processed Foods), sleep, drinking water and how all of that affects your body and health. The workouts themselves are fun and challenging and at the end of every class, I was exhausted… and still, I WANTED MORE!

The instructors are top notch! Will Baier is one of the friendly people I have ever met. Kris Clever is not only an expert at CrossFit, but she never failed to surprise me about how much she knows about the human body and its mechanics. And as I was a complete novice to CrossFit, Brian Orosco always had my back. I always felt Brian was looking out for my best interest and scaling each workout to my fitness level so I would get the most out of the workout without hurting myself.

Also the sense of community there is great. There are members who have been going and doing CrossFit for years and are 10x more fit than I am. But after they finished their workouts one of them was always coming over to encourage me to push and finish mine!

As I said, I went into Valley CrossFit’s 6-week Foundations program wanting to lose 10lbs. WHAT I GOT OUT OF IT WAS SO MUCH MORE.

• I am eating better and healthier.
• I definitely feel “stronger” and like I have more energy.
• My body no longer feels “stiff” all the time. (I can pick things up off the floor without groaning or grunting)
• My pants feel looser (I think I lost at least an inch off my waistline)
• And people have noticed my body is a bit more defined and the beer gut is going down.

Did I lose the 10 lbs in 6 weeks? No (The trainers said it’s because I’ve been putting on muscle which weighs more than fat). But what I realized is that it’s not about the weight loss.

It’s about the overall positive effects doing CrossFit at Valley CrossFit has had on me and I look forward to continuing the journey there.<//Review><rating>5<//rating>< Pics>

< Review>
I am just very sad that Valley Cross Fit didn't disclose the fact that I will not be able to use my coupon from groupon if I sign up for their 7 day free class. $69 unlimited class for a month is one of the choice that they have on the groupon website.  Now,  I didn't know about groupon website till I googled valley cross fit to find out there phone number. There it was and I saw the great deal and when I called the gym they said that I can't use the coupon because I already signed up for the free 7 day class. When I asked them how come they never disclosed that information and I didn't get any response. Its a better deal to do the unlimited class for $69 then to do the 7 free class. Its just really disappointing to see such thing happening. I understand that they don't care for just 1 customer (me) who will not be returning to them because they are already established organization and 1 unhappy customer doesn't make any difference to them...

I think all of us in this economy look for great deal and to see that for $69 I can get unlimited class was great. Then later on having to find out that I have to pay $199 because I went to their 7 day free class just doesn't feel right. Those coupons are there for customers and I am a very unhappy customer now. I have to pay extra $130 now that's only if I want to join anymore. I am just very upset that they would have a coupon option and then they will have another option to not to  let us use the groupon coupon.< /Review>

Unfortunately my experience here was subpar. The 2 stars is for the facility only: there's no denying that they have that down. This is not my 1st time with crossfit but I'm not drinking the CF kool aid (fulltime) either. I attended VCF 3x/wk for a couple of months and there was no sense of direction as far as programming was concerned: most coaches were making things up as they went along. And if you switched coaches during the week, their 'freestyle/imaginary programming' is completely different from the previous coach. The owner (Mike) is very impatient, sarcastic and constantly makes demeaning jokes towards students. I understand the need to be humorous during class, but not at the expense of a person in attendance. Being the first CF gym in the valley doesn't always make it the best place to try crossfit. So yeah, keep looking...<//text>

This is a gym for obsessed crossfit workout fanatics who like to be yelled at and made to feel like garbage while trying to get in better shape.  Not good for an average person looking for a basic workout.  I am someone who enjoys fitness and tries to do what I can to stay in shape... this place is not for me.  The main guy Mike (who was running the class the day I went) was a total d-bag.  He's mean, snarky, condescending and has a huge attitude.  And that attitude seems to have permeated to the regulars in the gym because they all basically had the same attitude.  Makes sense since the gym aims to create a psyco-bootcamp lifestyle - and a drill sergeant traditionally sets the tone for those under him.

If you are a professional crossfit health nut, this is probably the right place to be.  If you're someone just trying to get in better shape... I would go elsewhere.  There are a few other new style gyms in the area that I hear give a much more positive experience.   Everyone takes themselves way too seriously here.  It's just a gym!  I guess I will have to keep looking for another way to keep my workouts fun.</text>

No unique items. There is a sign outside that even says “park at own risk!”  How can I feel safe with that there?  Not worth the dollar it costs to get in. Be smart & stay away from this place.< /review>< GmapID>

You can see there are many culture's influencing the market, you can mostly find things from Mexico. There are food trucks, clothes, and other items. Great place to eat and find your own personal treasure. Would recommend it to people that might not be aware of it. 😃< /review>

What a huge disappointment. Went and very few vendors. Lots of fruit and Hispanic products. The few vendors selling stuff was outrageous they were expensive. Would no haggle some were downright rude. So beware.< /Review>

<review>Love this place. It is what a old time flea market should be. Lots to do see and eat. Many vendors will haggle with you. Its interesting some won't haggle and get mad if you walk away. Lots of tools and cheap tools. A bit of everything. Love to buy fruit and vegetables. Some even give samples. Go early for great selection and not very crowded.<//review>< pictures>

<review>From a Vendor point of view: Wednesday's space fee is way overpriced @ $25. Hardly any customers show up. Vendors are allowed to sell fake name brands such as Michael Kors, Adidas, Nike Pink as well as others and none of the staff says anything. This makes it really hard on the vendors who go out and by the real items and try to complete reselling against the fakes. Not Right and its illegal. The management of the Madera flea market should consider advertising more or doing something to draw more customers in and make it a better experience for all. It's time to stop raking in the money and telling all the vendors what they can't do and maybe try telling the vendors what you have done for them since they're the only reason that the entire flea market is open. Everybody steps on the little guy until he becomes your boss. On a positive note the food is great the vegetables look fabulous and most of the vendors are pretty nice, even most of the staff seem to have a real positive attitude.

I tell one, I tell all, come support the vendors at all the flea markets. Come and have a great time. Come and eat some delicious food. Take home some very unique and fabulous items. But remember the vendors work hard to pick, front the cash and buy this stuff for you. They can't sell it at a cheaper price than they paid, so please be considerate in your negotiations and don't insult a vendor buy offering half the price,  that they are asking. If you can't come somewhat close to their asking price  just being nice say thank you and move on. You have so many choices  that you don't have to insult the vendor, just a little word of advice.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>One busy place on Sunday. The Wed event is smaller, Sunday is huge. Mostly low quality clothing and such, but lots of good produce and hard to find seasonings and cooking stuff. The cheap new clothing is overpriced and isn't worth your hard earned money. Even had a Santa booth for the kiddos to take pics with him, and mini horse rides and even masseuse services. Lotta good food. Costs two bucks each person to get in. Very little of what is usually thought of for a swap meet, people selling their old stuff like tools or lawn furniture or whatever, it's almost all vendors with new stuff. You can do better buying most things online or at Wal-Mart as far as prices and quality go, but a fun time and place.<//Review>< pictures>
