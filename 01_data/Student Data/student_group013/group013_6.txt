<response>None< /response><Review>Great sushi place. We enjoyed everything we ordered. The fish is fresh, the restaurant is clean, and the service was quick. The prices are typical of sushi restaurants in the area. Parking is plentiful as it is located on the perimeter of a shopping mall, also making access quick in and out. They have a pretty extensive menu with all the sushi restaurant favorites, so if you're looking for a hearty, delicious sushi meal priced right, I recommend Love Boat Sushi.<//Review><time>1542315065427<//time></record></dataset><record>

<text>My first time in and I had the rainbow roll which was really fresh and looked great. It was a large portion and only $10.99 when most places charge $13 or more. Chef John was friendly and joked around. It was very clean inside with good service.< /text><gmap_id>0x80db7e3c5d22cf37:0x10923bddf7c4e9ae<//gmap_id>< date>

I have been here twice now.  Absolutely love their choices and the quality of the food. The baked mussels are the best I have ever had anywhere. The mussels are cut in smaller pieces, loaded with cheese and piled with crab meat. Had a soft shell crab dish that was the whole crab cut in 4 pieces. INCREDIBLE. My friend had the poke salad. This salad had sliced avocados on top, variety of fish. Except this salad wasn't laying on a bed of salad.. LOVED IT!!!
Will be back real soon!< /review>

A fantastic local sushi chain. I think they have two locations.  This one is perfect and the site is situated near the mall with options.  The service is fast and friendly and the fish has a fresh taste.< /review>

Truly an amazing establishment. I've been coming here for years and have received nothing but great service, delicious food and a full belly. Very fresh ingredients and fish. Anytime I'm in the mood for sushi, this is the place I go. The lunch boxes and ordering by the roll is my favorite way to go.</Review>

<text>Good food and the service was fantastic. A reasonable price per dish. No complaints here. I'll be back. Wait time for food was reasonable. The booths were comfortable.

This was my favorite place when I lived in the area. I was known to go at least twice a week. Sam, the owner, is a great person. High quality fish and friendly atmosphere. I don’t know a better place for Sushi in Temecula. 🍣<//review>

<review>Walked in and waited to be seated for a hot min.
All the workers just ignored us. After a bit I tried to catch the attention of a worker who was in front of me, I legit said “excuse me ma’am” three times and she ignored me. Ight. So we walked out and around the corner is another sushi place called “ youandi sushi” go here!!!!! This place is sooo beautiful inside, mellow, and the workers are very kind! Great place to take a date or be with family/friends!</review>< response>

< review>
I've been to this location three times. My first experience was not to a standard of which was pleasing. Our waitress was not personable at all, and every time we asked for things that should have been provided like napkins, straws (prior to the plastic straw ban) and drink refills, she gave us a disgusted look like we were bothering her. The different varieties of sushi we ordered were delicious nevertheless. At the suggestion of my husband, we decided to go a second time. Our second experience was a complete turn around, and we were pleasantly delighted with the service we received and there were no issues at all...all of our sushi choices were phenomenal. Our third visit was equally pleasing all around. The ambience of the place is quiet, and the space is not large, just right; the lights have been dimmed all the times I've visited (all visits were at night time). Overall, if you aren't looking for anything extra fancy, you should be pleased with their sushi options.<//review>

Very good sushi for the price and samon sushimi was very nice. Toro too expensive for me but I might try next time to see if it really worth it. 20 bucks. The rolls are made fresh for you very delicious. Service was good, friendly staff. Thanks</review>

This is the best sushi joint in town!! They have a wide selection of flavors. Each roll is flavorful and unique. These  chefs know what they are doing. This place is hands down better than Hana Sushi and Sushi Boat. Another plus is their customer service is amazing and every roll is also visually great! Even their cheapest rolls are incredible in taste and presentation. Absolute must place to visit!< /review>

So far I would say Sushi Love Boat has authentic tasting sushi. The atmosphere is welcoming and complimentary thanks to the chef for preparing each roll not only making it presentable but delicious. We tried the special rolls up to $15 rolls.<//text>

This is our go-to for Sushi! They are so friendly and the food is AMAZING! Best miso in town and make sure to try the spicy edamame...trust me! They have stamp cards for frequent diners and they will remember you when you come back time and time again. Personable and professional service. Excellent food.</text>

The Kobe Bryant roll was fantastic!  The salmon sashimi was also really good, although the pieces were small they serve 8 pieces.  The kids really enjoyed the tiger roll and I had a dragon roll that was great.  Every visit is a great experience.  Try everything.<//Review>

<Name>Alberto Villegas</Name><Review>I was disappointed in the taste of the food. But before I say anything about the food I have to say the customer service here is 5+. Server's where very attentive and nice.
Now the food.
Miso soup was bland. Needed salt?
Spicy edamame had an orange and again bland flavor to it.
The "KELI" roll had too much of an orange flavor. Not very good.
Tried a few other rolls and was just overall disappointed with the sushi.
Food is a 2 star but I'm adding a star for great customer service</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Best place in town for sushi, great service the waitresses are so sweet and accommodating. The owner takes the time to visit your table to say hi.

The yellowtail sashimi was frozen. I had to let it thaw to room temperature before eating it. Everything else was tasty, but the yellowtail.< /Review>

<Review>My husband and I have been going here since 2010 on our first date. It is always great food and service. Sadly, last two sundays ago, I went there again with my children my husband and my brother and customer service on that particular day was horrendous. The lady was so rude and treated us like children. This is the first time we get really bad customer service in 8 years of being a customer here. We are very disappointed. The waitress was short and yanked the menus from my husband's  hands. Rushed us to order because apparently  she cannot handle being busy with customers< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

The kid meal has teriyaki chicken, two california rolls, rice, salad and a pot sticker all for around $8. I have picky eaters and they beg to come here. If you like spicy food go for the "heart attack" roll. It's a jalapeno sushi roll and it is amazing! The parking is close and thw atmosphere is super clean and friendly. Good price for sushi.< /Review>< Pictures>

They have the best sushi and its the freshest! My boyfriend and I go at least once a week. The chefs are so friendly and you feel like you know them instantly. I don't eat rolls usually but the ones I have had there are great. The garlic albacore Is my favorite! Also sometimes we will treat us to an appetizer of short ribs or filet mignon wrapped asparagus, they are awesome!< /Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Best sushi in Temecula! Just as great as the sushi in SD! I bought a voucher from DealPalooza for $30 worth of sushi and sake for $15! I went with my boyfriend and we had 4 delicious large rolls and sake and only had to pay $20 out of pocket. Their sushi is soo rocking delicious and the staff is very friendly and welcoming!<//Review>

Best place to shop for special occasion gifts and keepsakes! Excellent service.  My items were ready within one hour the day before the entire Temecula School District had their promotions/ graduations! They must manage their workload well to be so caught up during a busy time.  Really grateful everything turned out perfect !< /Review>

<response>None< /response><text>Beyond disappointed! Had 3 stainless steel cups engraved as a Christmas gift for my sisters. They did not bother to center the engraving, all 3 were completely off sand none matched with their being off- centered. The work was obviously rushed with no thought process. I am certain that if it is their item I had engraved, they would have made it look better, a lot better.</text><Gmap_id>0x80db7e3dec73fea5:0x382ffb282ef09c77</Gmap_id><username>Malou Cephas<//username><rate>1</rate>< Time>

I give it 1 star b/c the first girl I talked to was actually great.  She was nice!  My husband kept going back and forth on what he wanted engraved via telephone and the woman behind the desk was very understanding and extremely nice - I give her 5 stars!  I went home to get dressed for the get-to-gether (for which I needed the engraved present) and came back to pick up my item.  I stood in line patiently ( I was a waitress for years) and waited my turn.  There were two women off to the side who were being helped and two women in front of me who couldn't decide on which clock they wanted.  Nikki - the customer service representative for the store left the two women on the left and came back to the register to ask the women in front of me if they decided on the clock they wanted.  The women began to discuss back and forth which item they were going to choose.  I figured - hey!  I'm in a hurry; while they wait I'll just grab my item and get out of everyone's hair.  I asked Nikki.  "I'm actually in a hurry; can I just pick up my item really quickly?"

Nikki gave me a very pointed look, a fake smile, and a stare from death and said "i'll be with you in just a moment".  I thought to myself, "okay.....".  She directed her attention back to the women choosing a clock.  Because the women were choosing a clock they were talking amongst themselves.  I waited probably one full minute (while Nikki WATCHED the women talk amongst themselves) and walked around the women to the side of the counter and said again, "I'm really in a hurry - is there any way you can just grab my item really quickly?"

Again - I received the death stare with a sugar coated "I'm helping customers at the moment - I'll be with you as soon as I can"....

I am not used to people (especially customer service representatives from which I am purchasing a high quality item) being pointedly and overtly disgustingly rude to my face and me sitting there and taking it.

At this point, I lost all all regard to Emily Post's guide to manners and told Nikki exactly what her attitude suggested I tell her.  The funny thing is, from the moment I served Nikki exactly what she was serving me, she became much more accommodating (in a very RUDE manner)....

I wanted to PICK UP MY ITEM AND LEAVE THE STORE.  Again, from years of waiting tables and becoming an expert in time management, I KNOW the fastest way to handle a busy store is DO WHAT YOU CAN WHEN YOU CAN and LOSE THE FRIGGIN' ATTITUDE.

I will NEVER go back to this particular store. My husband is  a U.S. Marine and we tend to need a lot of items engraved.  From this point forward I will

1) go 30 miles out of my way to get everything done on base
2) Let every U.S. Marine's wife within a 60 mile radius know what RUDE customer representatives Things Remembered in Temecula, CA employ.

I will NEVER shop here again til the day I die.  You can bet your bee-hiney on that one!!!!  Thanks, Nikki!  I hope I spelled your name incorrectly.< /text>

Their products sell themselves fortunatly. I was in there just before Mothers day, and the manager was, bickering at a new employee and being very sarcastic to him while I was trying to place an order. I am luck they got it right, I wasn't sure of what I ordered until I got it back.< /Text>

I was very disappointed.  She said it would take 2 hours so I gave her over 5.  I showed up near closing time and it had not even been started.  Poor service.</review>

< review>
I ordered by phone. They told me to pick up in 10 minutes.  I gave them 15 minutes before I arrived. Paid for my for food, which wasn't cheap, had to wait an additional 20 minutes just for partial of my order which was cold.  And then didn't get my entire order until 15 minutes after. I literally oy ordered 2 super fries & 2 tacos.  I won't be going back for a long time especially with the prices and long waiting.</review>

Anytime I’ve eaten here it has been good. The tortillas are awesome. The pastor is my favorite and the fish tacos are also very delicious. Fast and fairly inexpensive. Moreno’s is my favorite taco shop in Madera.<//Text>

Very authentic Mexican food. Doesn't look like much from the outside. Don't let that stop you from going in. The owners are super friendly.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><review>(Translated by Google) I often go to this restaurant because I like to order some roasted meat or chicken cakes, they prepare them very rich and also for their seafood, do not say the broths to not make the story so long, all their food is the best the person who already knows already knows it and the one who does not, if you doubt it, take a look around and they will see that it is true.

Yo seguido voy a este restaurant porque me gusta ordenar unas tortas de carne asada o de pollo las preparan bien ricas y también por sus mariscos no se diga los caldos pa no hacer tan largo el relato toda su comida es de lo mejor la persona que ya conoce ya lo sabe y la que no si lo duda dese una vuelta y verán que es cierto.< /review>< gmapID>

<text>Love that they turned an old warehouse into an indoor soccer field for the winter league. However, it's just as cold in the warehouse as it is outside so make sure to bring blankets and jackets to stay warm. Also, the drive in looks pretty creepy especially at night since you have to drive in from a dead end street so make sure you have your lights on and drive slowly in.</text>< user>

<name>Go Eagles</name>< Review>
I have 2 sons who have played numerous seasons at this facility. They try to pack in as many games as possible and as a result teams rarely get her full time.  As soon as one game ends they are starting the timer for the next game. For example the game before my son's game today was a championship game and so the team and parents were taking pictures after the game on the field. However as soon as I game was done the referee started the time for our gameWhich couldn't start because the team appearance before us were still taking pictures which means that our team and the team we're playing for short at least 5 minutes of a 20 minute half. It's a nice little scam and with the try to make as much money as possible but really ends up short changing the kids and the parents. I would really think twice before playing here and pay your money.< /Review>

<Text>I had Horrible experience here, I had  my son’s 9th Birthday Party. Host was 15 min late to open.  I had 20 angry soccer players waiting outside with no contact information available.The host after being late slow at getting everything started, still ran my time and overcharged me. When I went to get my refund the owner proceeds to get angry at me for asking for my refund after being overcharged. Do not book a party here this was my 4th party here and I will never return to this arena again. New owner avoid this place.< /Text>< GmapID>

A rated restaurant. Parking is limited. be warned there's a $0.50 charge for credit card use. I order orange chicken beef broccoli and chow mein. It came out to $8 and some change. and surprisingly they give you a free fortune cookie. This is the first time I got one of these in a very long time. Orange chicken ☆☆☆ beef broccoli ☆☆☆. Chow mein ☆☆☆<//review>

Prices charged not worth the so so food. Then they charge you for using debit or credit card an extra 50 cents. Bathroom is closed and attitude by cashier. Nothing good here there are other places that have better food for your money.</Text>

I am not been to Royal food since the pandemic I stopped going into the office but since we started teleworking  the last couple weeks the  food was really good it was fresher and tastier than before and it was late in the evening when you think It's late and they give you the last but I'll be back<//Review>

<review>This is my 2nd time here and the food taste great. Food is fresh and canned sodas are very cold. They give you a good amount of food for the price. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I think they could do a better job at keeping it clean.<//review><Rate>4</Rate>< Resp>

<Text>Great food, the orange chicken was delicious and crunchy. My vegan friend thought the food was quite savory. Polite and friendly staff. The Thai Tea boba was good but my mother didn't like it. I definitely will come again,.. just without my mom.<//Text>< Name>

What an interesting store full of books and gifts and spiritual goodies! The whole store has this beautiful slow feeling to it, soothing with the music and chimes. They have a nice variety of books and audio books, along with yoga mats, eclectic gifts and home decor.

If there was a space for used books, that would be awesome.<//Text>

If we could control these things we would.  But just like we can't control people giving us bad reviews for things we can't control,  we can't control publishers either.

I had been once before with a group of friends like 2 years ago but didn't end up buying anything that. Today i just randomly decided to go to the store with my best friend and we fell inlove with the store. Supper nice guy and even taught us a bit about crystals. :)< /Review>

< Review>
Been there before and bought some really affordable crystals. Also have bought some other lovely items you can't get at a big box shop  (wink) ....
Just yesterday I went there on a whim that they might have a genre of books I'm interested in reading. Asked a few questions and had the most lovely experience with such kind and knowledgeable humans. The staff and owner gave me great advice on how to find what I was seeking! I am now beyond thrilled as I have several new insights just from this conversation within the sacred space of such an incredible shop!

Feels like I'm entering the Holy of holies everytime I go there and the owner's dog is so chill. The energy is so soothing and I love the restored sensation I have everytime I go there.
You definitely need to stop by if you're ever in Santa Monica!<//Review>

Such a fun store to go and visit! Who doesn't love a good book? This place has a wide variety of options for bookworms. Why buy new when you can get a gently used book at less than half the price?</Review>

<text>Great metaphysical store with a focus on spiritual growth and development. Both Eastern and Western mysticism. Also great tools, instruments, books, and materials for healers, shamans, spiritual teachers, and other such practitioners of the mystic arts.
This store displays The Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life by Drunvalo Melchizedek. They know what they're doing and are not simply riding on the coattails of mainstream watered down spirituality for people on a temporary romantic kick after watching Eat Pray Love or being inspired by a celebrity who's into Ram Dass.<//text><Name>Emma Bennett<//Name>< Date>

<text>An amazing bookstore. The staff are so courteous, well versed,
and its like stepping in heaven for a short while. The place is mystical,
and holds many treasures.  I return each time to buy books, crystals,
or to browse.
I highly recommend Thunderbolt Spiritual Books.

I was visiting my aunt and we decided to go to Santa Monica one day so I visited this shop. The people at the counter were very friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was very cozy, and I think there was a dog which made the store 200% better ;)< /review>

<Text>Russell the owner is a beautiful sounding person on the PHONE! that is important. I called requesting a book which he was sold out of . He told me he would order it and have for me by friday less than 3 days and offered to call when it is in.  I wasn't til the end of the conversation that he informed me he was the owner. Kudos and Blessings Be . Can't wait to visit his shop and explore,If the vibe over phone is anything like the atmosphere of the shop I will become a customer for life.<//Text>< date>

What a lovely, locally owned book shop that has something for everyone at a range of price points. Less than a 10 minute walk from the Third Street Promenade!

You can find everything from a $1 sticker to a $4 crystal to a $600 porcelain Buddha. Regardless of your faith or spirituality, there is a vast selection to explore. I love their cook books, yoga instruction books and their children's section.

Excellent selection, fair prices and a kind approach to customer service.

If you're looking to grow your faith, your practice or are looking for spiritual guidance in your life, this is a great place to start.

Pro Tip:
- Skip Amazon and browse for your books here!</review>

I have been a frequent customer of Thunderbolt Spiritual Books over the past 7 years, and let me tell you that this place is wonderful. There is something for everyone, and mostly all faiths and forms of spirituality are covered. The downstairs area has an enormous buddah statue where coins and offerings have been left, and it is encircled by small stonesx minerals and crystals that are being sold. There is a larger selection on the left and also kept behind cases to the rear. Along the other wall is a selection of books and tarot cards as well as other tools for divination (runes, healing cards), a selection of prayer beads and bracelets and yoga mats and accessories. Upstairs there are more books and seminars and workshops are held on occasion. They sell a wide range of art; statuettes, tapestries, wall ornaments and pictures to name a few. They also have incense, sage, candles and oils and jewelry made by local artists. All of their staff is extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and Tara the owners' dog is a sweetheart. A place you MUST visit when you are nearby!</Text>

< Review>
This nacho Bell was our last option for today. When we walked in it smelled like rotten food. But I wasn’t surprised because it’s a Taco Bell. The food standard qualities are the same standard qualities as all the other Taco Bell’s. The only positive thing I can say is that it’s hot. The lady was very nice although I do not understand half the things that she said. I will only come here as a last resort. They should definitely hire other people to clean this Taco Bell because of that smell. We ordered the nacho Bell grande a cheese burrito and two tacos. The meet was made out of some kind of meat and the rest of the taco was made out of some other kind of taco stuff. All I can say is that it’s hot that’s it</Review>

I've used this drive through a few times recently, always get through the line quickly and they remember your fire sauce. The chain has simplified their menu but other than prices creeping up most people know what they're getting with TB.</text>

Ok, it's taco bell but finally I came home with my food with no sour cream.  I don't go to fast food much but when I do I wasn't thinking of Taco Bell cause they would always screw up my order.  Tonight they get a five star!< /review>

One of my usual places to eat near my house. Pretty speedy most of the time, but note that the inside closes at 10pm and the drive through backs up pretty quick. The bathroom cleanliness leaves something to be desired (use the one that's hidden from view until you get to the end of the hall as it gets less traffic)< /text>

Horrible service I would give it a zero if I could I come here all the time and I order spicy Doritos tacos and they always let me and now today I go to the drive thru first they make me wait 15 minutes and then they take the order and after that she got it wrong and so we told her to replace it and she did by taking something off the menu instead of exchanging it and then we told her again and she stormed off which is really rude considering it was her fault and not ours. And on top of that this other lady came out and started yelling at us saying we made her friend cry or something and I was so confused like I’m srry she took our order wrong :| horrible service<//Text>

<review>I normally don't give 1 star ratings to businesses but this one, I just had to. There food is okay, same kind of food every other Taco Bell sells so I am okay with that but what makes this Taco Bell get 1-star from me is their customer service. I have been there so many times, I actually started going there every other day on my way back from home.but everytime, literally every single time despite asking for sauce 2 times, they just don't put it in my bag. I get it they forget it sometimes but literally, everytime. If I let them know that they forgot to put sauce in my bag last think they treat me like as if I am asking for discount, no I am not. I am just letting you know.<//review>< pics>

PROS: I love, love this Taco Bell. Besides the fact that I really do enjoy Taco Bell food, I especially like the people working here; Thomas comes to mind. He is a wonderful person, greets you the moment you enter, knows you by name, and is quite personable. The restaurant is clean, the outside is well kept, no trash, landscaping is nice, and parking lot has ample parking. Just don't bring your RV or big trucks here!

THE ONE & ONLY CON: Not a drive-thru. :-((

Other than that, I will frequent this Taco Bell often!< /review>

The day manager is awesome and extremely helpful and fair. Food never seems to be wrong. That's a real treat with fast food these days. The managers really on it. However the night manager as of August 15th is the slowest rudest person I've ever seen in fast food. Are ordered my meal here at Taco Bell and it took 20 minutes for them to make it and give it to me. I confronted the manager about it and all she did was stare at me. One of the other people who work for the woods in the manager stepped in and said I'm sorry about that. Taco Bell get this place under control< /text>

<Text>Food is just as good as other taco bells. But one time in the morning, they decided to pour water/soap all over the floor to mop and told us to use the drive through. Service at the drive-through was questionable at best. No utensils with my skillet bowl and they gave us the wrong type of sauce that we asked for.</Text>< pics>

I've been to this place countless times because it's so close to my house and they always mess up my order.

My most recent experience was horrible. They didn't wrap my burritos properly and it leaked all over the seat. I spent hours cleaning my car the next day.

Only advice I can give is triple check your order before you leave. They frequently forget to pack something.

I try drive to a different location whenever I am in the mood for some Taco Bell.<//review>

The food is good but service is slow. If they say it will be ready in 30 min, get ready to wait 50 min to an hour.</text>

I visited this place twice and both experiences were pretty much same.  The fish quality was decent but the atmosphere of interior design and amount of the sushi per/pc just doesn't equates to the price you're paying for, especially in ktown. However, the servers were attentive.</Text>

Good service and fresh food. The short rib yakitori was a little dry, bacon wrapped asparagus was tasty. We tried the miso black cod dinner that came with soup, salad and rice. The fish was tasty. Miso soup was good but very salty. For rolls we tried the forever roll which is wrapped with cucumber and doesn't have rice. It was really good. Also had the simmering albacore, I liked the onion topping but the fish itself was a little warm and fibrous for my liking. Overall the bill was on the pricey side but we also ordered a lot. The waitress was very nice and attentive.< /Text>

We ordered happy hour 4rolls.
Servers keep forgetting my ask for hot tea or our food.

Also i felt some really hard plastic in the roll.
I didn’t take a photo because i didn’t want to ruin the vibe my date.

I never go this place again.</text>

I ordered to go from Sushi Hon on Wednesday, 5/1 and was majorly disappointed. I got the miso soup and the Uni Me specialty roll, which cost a pretty penny. However, the roll was barely any food and the fish in the roll was mostly cheap tuna I could have gotten at another restaurant for half the price. The sea urchin did not taste fresh, and it was lacking in flavor. I was also upset that the miso soup container was only half full.

For the price and reviews, I expected so much more.</text>

<Text>Sushi On is one of my favorites for having Sushi items. Their special foods include Tuna Roll, Chicken Karaage, Miso Black Cod, Avocado Roll, Chicken Teriyaki, Salmon Skin Roll, Take Wasabi. Recommended to people for trying once and have the taste.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Came here for the first time and fell in love. This place is probably one of the best sushi places is I've been too. Great service. I highly recommend the sexy roll, alba alba roll, and hot night roll. Miso soup was a bit too salty for my taste. Sesame ice cream is better than the green tea at his place in my opinion even though my go to is always green tea. I would definitely come back :)<//review>< pics>

<Review>Family ran business,  really care about every single customer and they try to make sure that you had good food.
I rate their lebanese food 10/10 , really one of the best lebanese resturants in OC , food tastes really authentic.
The owner was really nice too.
I love their home made sides like the yogurt and the pickles.
I took off one star out of 5 and for the portions , i feel the portions can improve , as you can see in the pictures , i ordered grape leaves and literally there only 10 pieces in mg place ONLY , and that lunch was like 30$ ...so yeah food is really good , nice atmosphere , nice owners but pricey for the small portions< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPpy3NM2ioRMJvx-znYqZJIJBYP_Ex2Ent3UJW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMp6Q_VJxqdmGBbrXZMBBE9bT0ON6RdKgw_BA_U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

One of my favorite lunch spots.  Some people thought it was closed but it isn't.  They got their Yelp and web site hacked.  Had lunch there last week.  Best hummus I've ever had.  Susan makes it fresh and also makes here own olives. Yum.</Text>

<Review>Upon the recommendation of a friend, we dined at Cafe Matinee a few weeks ago for dinner.  We had a fantastic time.  The food was phenomenal.  The tabbouleh and shawarma were the best. Looking forward to trying the garlic chicken.  The owner came out and talked us through our meal.  The Lebanese coffee was also amazing.  Look forward to going back.</Review>< Rating>

My wife and I fell in love with this place after one visit. First, it's a family ran/owned business. They care about quality over quantity. The food was absolute great and tasted very fresh. Both my wife and I grew up with Middle Eastern family friends and enjoyed their homemade dishes. This place taste just like that...homemade! I've traveled to many Middle East countries (Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, UAE, Bahrain, Iraq, Turkey) and have ate at many places throughout those countries and this place has the best tasting hummus I've ever had. Not only the hummus, but everything we had! They treated my family and I like one of their own and their generosity and hospitably is to talk about.</Text>

A little hole-in-the-wall Lebanese restaurant run by a family who seems very genuine in wanting to share their food. Every dish I've had the chance to try here has been excellent. I have yet to see a wait here.<//Text>

OMG! I had no idea Lebanese food was so good. Every bite was better than the last. From the hummus in the beginning to the ba'alawa at the end. Delicious.</Review>

The service food and atmosphere here are excellent. It is tucked away in a strip mall so you would not expect much from it. The food is wonderful with delicious kebabs. I personally like the ground beef kebab as it has amazing flavor. The hummus here is also one of the best I've tried. For desert there is baklava.<//text>

<review>We ate here for the first time and not only the food was DELICIOUS, but our server was delightful! She was very honest with us about what we should order, making sure we did not order too much. She was just like "mom." The humus was amazing, but if you don't like it with hot spice, be sure to let them know. We look forward to going back!</review></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1355000574565<//Time><review>Unbelievable flavors. I hate spending a lot of money at restaurants because of the guilt that follows,  but pay with no regrets here. Must have: lamb....it melts off your fork. Sojouk...taste explosions!  Babaganooj: i can't spell it, but I can eat it; and eat it I do. Great hummus. Have the Ksara Rouge wine. Worth the price of a bottle!</review></record>

Super super pricey place you don’t to go there and be ripped off, 15.99 for 6 pieces of falafel plate, you can go to any other restaurant and get way cheaper prices<//Review>

Spectacular in way, but no your classic Solvang “Danish” joint.  Long line on Sat but worth every minute of the wait.  BTW it’s enough food for us but if you are used to IHOP you might think the plates are small.</review>

Love their breakfast..
Love the prices...

Just need to work on figuring out the long line.
We definitely make it our breakfast place when visiting.

<GmapID>0x80e9559ac571108b:0x92fd28e3b3a2cc83< /GmapID><Text>I chose this place for my birthday brunch spot and the front patio seating. Sadly, we were placed in the back of the restaurant by the parking lot. The tables were very dusty to where we had to request the table to be wiped down. I felt we were discriminated against because we were Mexican. There was a White family behind us (same head count) as we ordered and they were sat in the front patio. As we sat near cars, a Mexican couple was placed out back next to us as well as an Indian family. I got up to check the front patio and there were plenty of tables to accommodate. We had no table service once our food was brought out. As we excited thru the parking lot and walked out front, there was nothing but White people sitting happily in the front getting catered to. I will NEVER EVER eat at this place along with their other chains...CHOMP Burgers, Fries and Shakes or The Coffee House by CHOMP.<//Text><response>None< /response><userid>100526749186248974030< /userid>< Pictures>

Had to try this place after reading the reviews and seeing how long the lines are. They have a good selection of different foods. But their drink selection was very minimal. Coffee, lemonade, orange juice and hot chocolate. Everything else was wine. Their mimosa was ok. The food was good. Nothing out of this world.< /Text>

I got the Danish pancakes, which were on the thick side. Came with 1 sliced strawberry and a few blueberries, not at all like the picture. Also one tiny side of syrup. Not so bad but it was a long time before anybody checked on us,so I gave up and took the rest to go. My wife got the almond butter French toast, it was wonderful. Also the sausage was bratwurst, not breakfast sausage.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

It's a nice ambiance with a friendly staff located in the heart of Solvang. Food was very much mediocre at best. I mean the only thing that stood out for breakfast was the tater tots. I had the eggs Benedict that had a flavorless hollandaise sauce. My fruit bowl and pancake was very good but my wife's omelette was just okay. Was hoping for something a little more. Just a tad disappointed and don't think we'll be returning but worth a try. Not overly expensive just didn't get blown away by anything</review>

It was our very first visit and took the recommendation of the hostess and my husband tried the Chorizo Egg Scramble Bowl which was an excellent mix of Egg with Chorizo topped with a sprinkle of cheese, sour cream, fresh cilantro and avocado. The tortilla strips sprinkled on top were a nice touch and went perfectly with their homemade salsa. I had the Monte Cristo, which was a perfect blend of savory and sweet. This spin on the sandwich was made with two pieces of French toast, lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar and offered two dipping sauces of raspberry jelly and a light maple syrup. So good!!! And to complete this wonderful breakfast experience was the great coffee and superb service we received from the friendly staff that was hosting and serving.</Review><username>Roanne Saucedo<//username><time>1617829554135</time></record>

The french toast was amazing! The kids loved them. The chilaqulas were okay. I love spicy so they didn't really do it for me but what should I expect at a Danish restaurant 🤷🏼‍♀️ the servers were super nice and the food came out quick! We will be returning for breakfast again tomorrow!
Update!
Went back again and had the breakfast bowl and it was good!<//text>

<Review>Food was fairly good, but somehow we missed a good hostess. The table next to us was constantly getting attention. We were asked only once if everything was okay, and it was from somebody walking by. Not even giving us the courtesy of stopping. We'll come back for the food, but if we ever get treated like this again it'll definitely be our last visit. I hope the management makes a note of this.<//Review>< date>

<review>Went here on a Sunday morning during Covid. Absolutely loved it, my whole family loved it. Everyone was super nice and attentive. Definitely coming back next time I'm in Solvang. The food was super good and inexpensive for the big sized portions you're given. If you come on Sunday like past 10 then there will be a line, I recommend going early.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

We went to Brekkies two days in a row for breakfast during our visit to Solvang. We had different dishes each day and loved every single one. The French toast and waffles were perfectly cooked. The egg dishes were balanced and tasty. The tater tots were fried to perfection! Service was exceptional - everyone was so kind and attentive. Highly recommend for great food and a great experience!</review>

Very relax atmosphere fast accurate service and constantly checking on us will defetnelly recommend the only thing is you pay before they seat you and that includes the tip or you can wait afterwards I guess you can tip at the end I just feel like I was supposed to do it at that moment is just a little different from what I'm used to<//Text>

<Rate>2</Rate><Review>The only thing impressive about this place other than location/view was that there wasn't a wait time. Ordered the chilaquiles, which stated that they came with sour cream. FALSE. Had to ask for a side of sour cream. The black beans served as a side were DISGUSTING. Straight up from a can with ZERO flavor. The actual chilaquiles were smothered in cheese, which typically isn't a bad thing, but it was too much. The eggs were cooked to perfection! Lastly, we went there on a Saturday and they "supposedly" close at 2. FALSE. At 1:50pm, I attempted to order a "to-go" meal for someone at home and was told that something in the kitchen was no longer working - code for: we are lazy and closed the kitchen so we can leave on time. The only reason I am giving 2 stars is because the service was okay, food came out quickly and restaurant was clean (except that they have salt/pepper shakers on every table for EVERYONE to touch - yuck!).<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

This is an awesome place for breakfast. So good and the flavor was hands down great. The waitress was on top of coffee refills and always smiling. If you are in solvang and undecided about the food, you must try this for morning food. Try the Monte Cristo with tator tots.</Text>

Our server Chance was about the only good thing about our visit to brekkies. My wife and I ordered breakfast. I ordered biscuits and gravy and she ordered hot and spicy omllett. Both arrived cold and my biscuits where hard not to mention I only received a dollop of gravy for both biscuits. I will pass on this place the next time I want breakfast in Solvang.< /review>

Great location. Other than that we were not impressed. The server was new, so we will go easy on him. He tried to do a good job. The food though, we expected a better experience. The eggs Benedict was unremarkable, and my wife wondered why there was no hash browns in her breakfast burrito. She said it was bland otherwise. We split a side of biscuits and gravy and didn't finish it because the flavor of rosemary was extremely overpowering in the gravy and the biscuits were doughy, as if undercooked, not light and fluffy as expected. Generally when a place opens, they are still working out the kinks so we will give them another chance after some time. Hopefully they will get their flavors en pointe. This place could go either way. Hopefully it will become another great breakfast location in Solvang.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>First time here and it was very nice. My server, Blake, was super nice. I was wondering why they did not have hash browns but when I had the tater tots, I got it. They were incredible. Next time I go I am getting just the tots smothered in gravy. I understand that's not "Keto" correct but what the heck,  it's the start of a cheat day.
As a side note, I remember this location was the KFC 45 years ago.</review>< pics>

Beautiful patio with grapes growing over entrance trellis...friendly attentive staff and excellent menu with GF and Vegitarian option. Choose to substitute fruit bowl for tater tots is my suggestion. Very accommodating place.<//Text>

Waited for more than 25 minutes to get my omelette and pancake. Yes, an omelette and a pancake. Foods tasted ok but not great. Servers didn’t care much about guests. They were’t rude but not friendly for sure. I had do find my table by myself. Seriously? Reviews are overrated for such a mediocre brunch cafe.< /review>

<Text>You’d rather not make seats near the bathroom and make your customers eat there. It was such a disgusting experience!

<Text>My experience at Dhillon Motorsports was extremely professional, even though I messed up twice while getting my car smogged! Since my car had been sitting unused for so long due to COVID changing my schedule, the computer had been wiped clean and could not be smogged. The owner was very patient (even though it was clearly a busy day for them) and explained to me exactly what I needed to do to prepare my car.

After following his directions, I ended up being two hours late for my follow up appointment because of a last minute meeting. The team was very professional about my running so late and took care of my car as soon as was possible. I appreciate how they handled both of my mixups and will definitely be back and recommend them to others! They really were so understanding and made the process painless!<//Text>< name>

They do not advertise their top notch *tire mounting* and *road force balancing* capabilities. Best kept secret, no lines, short waits compared to the big tire places.

I highly recommend this business.<//review></record>

Came in for a Smog check on a 1991 car. The service was quick. The receptionist and the technicians were very nice. Very good customer experience overall.< /review>

First surprise, Smog Man was actually a woman. I needed a smog certificate to register my car. It's my opinion that this particular shop did an excellent job for me. They had my car in and out in record time and even noticed the excellent long term car I've taken of my vehicle. The waiting area was clean and comfortable. The entire experience was a pleasant surprise.</review>

Great Experience!  These people are Pros!  at smog-related issues.  Love 'em!  2nd time using. Highly recommend. Might use them for other work on my car (though like where I already go).  I'd give them a Million Stars if I could. 5 is not enough.  Thank U Dhillon Motorsports (aka Smog Man).<//Review>

I went in to get a smog check for my truck. Front desk lady was very kind and answered all my questions politely and with good knowledge. The guys in the back went through the process and I was out of there within 25 min with a paper saying my truck passed and word that my document was sent to the DMV. They also have a coffee machine, free water, an old school Pac-Man game and comfy couches to sit on while you wait. Due to Covid tho everything was blocked off except for the couches but that’s OK we all got cell phones right. Taking my Subaru there today for a smog check as well. Hoping for the same great experience.< /text>

<review>I brought my BMW down to get a smog test and it didn't pass, much to my surprise I was told it would be no charge and to just bring it back when I was ready to try once again. I was really happy when I returned and my car passed with flying colors. Thank you smog man you took care of me and my car and it's all good now.<//review>< response>

I went to Dhillon (Smog Man) for a smog test. Check-in and service was quick and courteous. The technician was knowledgeable and courteous and easy to talk to. The waiting room is clean, roomy, well lit, and Covid conscious. There's even a free-play arcade game for those so inclined. Their prices seemed fair and I also used a Groupon, so my bill was exceptionally low. Though my car passed it's smog test, it still needs some other smog related work. I'm bringing my car back to Dhillon for that.<//Text>

<date>1598291242581<//date><Rate>5</Rate><review>I have a hybrid vehicle. About a week ago, I was driving and out of the blue a “maintenance required. Battery for the cooling system for the hybrid battery is low. Consult your dealer”.
I was taking my vehicle to a mechanic near Costco, dragon auto shop. They assured me that they had worked with hybrid vehicles before. But clearly they didn’t know what they were doing because they weren’t doing a full inspection.
That’s when I decided to come to Dhillon Motorsports, I checked the warranty on my vehicle and it looks like like this place was another match. I just didn’t trust the dragon shop anymore.
The first thing that I noticed was the amazing customer service from Cathy! She is so smart and knows exactly what she’s talking about!
she knew how to answer my questions and further assisted me to other things that I didn’t even know about my car. Like that my keys were low on battery.
It was all around amazing service! This shop isn’t the type that will just take your money and let you drive off. They really care about your safety on the road. Plus I like that any work you get done with them If the light comes back on they fix it for you! How nice right?< /review>< pictures>

The front office staff, Kathy, was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable with my smog issue for my Toyota Land Cruiser. I arrived early and she was able to accommodate me.  K, the owner, was extremely patient with my vehicle as it sat for a couple of years and had a few issues. I will be coming back for years and recommending family and friends.<//text>

We first went to this place for a smog test, and they were very efficient and had a nice waiting room. So when we needed our categoric converter replaced after it was stolen, we took our car to Dhillon Motors. They did a great job and kept us informed at each step.</review>

< Review>
I took my car in for a smog check. On the way there the Oil Pressure light came on and I phoned to cancel. They offered to check the OBDII codes to see if we could proceed. No check engine conditions so we were free to continue! They went the extra step to make sure that my service could be completed successfully. I would have missed the registration due date had they not offered that extra service. In and out in 20 minutes! Excellent service, very professional operation and nice greeting. COVID-19 aware and careful! (I appreciated that!) They even wiped down the credit card machine's stylus so I could pick it up and sign without concern. Nice! Highly recommended.< /Review>

<Text>I have had three cars smog checked here -- two under the old name and one under the new.  I've noticed no difference in the service; it's always great.  The receptionist is friendly and knowledgeable and the check in process was seamless.  I had to bring one of my cars back a second time because it had had engine work and needed more miles put on it before smog.  They honored my old Groupon for this which was great.  The waiting area is very comfortable and there are outlets to plug in one's electronics which is always great, so I was able to get some work done while I was there.  However, I didn't have to wait long at all which was the best part of all!  Great business, would definitely recommend.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fcb512fe6649d:0xd3ef53758d0049bd< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>this is the type of repair shop you dream of finding. i have had several repairs done here as well as a few smogs. i have always been impressed with the ability and professionalism of this shop. this shop has always gone above and beyond for me. i can’t wait to have them fix it again next month for the last few things to repair. i also like that they can make a key for your car. i am so pleased with my sun roof that they fixed. they worked on my my hybrid and wow the price tag was way better than the dealership and other shops.</Review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They waited until I went in to pay to tell me, “by the way, your brakes need to be redone.” They said it would be about $2,000 to fix the brakes. I have had zero problems with my brakes and I know the signs to look for. I have also had to have repairs such as the ones they “recommended” for my brakes, so I know that cost was way too high. It was then that I knew they had taken advantage of me. I will never go there again.< /text>< pictures>

I found them through Groupon. I called to make an appointment before I purchased the Groupon. They said I didn't need to purchase the Groupon and they would honor the price anyway. The smog test was completed within the estimated time. 100% would recommend for all of your automobile mechanical needs.<//Review>

Explained I had a motor swap on my
1987 Monte Carlo SS.
Asked to speak to technician because I just didn’t really trust the young lady over the phone.
Passed experience’s made me do this hope she understands when she reads this.
Tech “Kay” the owner sounded confident and new exactly what he was talking about. Funny thing is that he had just worked on another vehicle with similar swap from same mechanic that did my swap.
Went in young lady at the desk really did understand cars and she was really nice and listens to your needs.
I was glad to find this place because they really know what they are doing and the place is really clean! I also needed a new gas cap and he had a new one in stock that’s good customer service!
In the past people would not know what to do or not even want to touch my car because of the swap I had even tho my swap was legit Bar and all.
Thanks Kay for your help!
Also staff great service!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>My experience was pleasant and stress free! Very professional and sharp receptionist. I appreciate the thorough report that was complimentary for my current areas of concerns. As a female, I felt I was in good hands. I will be doing more business with Dhillon for sure.</text>< Pics>

<review>Had a Groupon smog check. Making the appt was quick, car checkin was courteous and exactly on time, service was clean and done in 20mts. Lady behind counter was informative and perfect service rep for the business. Kudos to her
The whole experience could not have been better.
Waiting for service parking might be a issue but i was able to locate one right away.</review>< Rating>

This is the 4th time that the team at Dhillon Motorsports/Smog Man have smogged my car.  I find no reason to take it to anywhere else.  They are fast, professional and reasonable.  Check them out.</text>

<review>Had to get my smog check done during SIP (they relaxed rules on DL, but wasn't sure if I could delay smog) and they had a very clean and efficient process for getting people in and out. Had my smog completed in about 20 minutes and the emails during/after were great to outline updates, pricing and findings. Would definitely come back for any future work as they were very courteous and transparent!</review>< Pictures>

."It was not fog, as you thought. It was smog."― Mahrukh

Dhillon Motorsports (fka Smog Man) is my go-to place for getting my semi-annual smog test.

Covid update: They are currently by appointment only! Call ahead to schedule.

Pros:

-Fast service

-Friendly and efficient receptionist

-No need for a Groupon® as they always have a Yelp* check-in offer (currently $39.75 + $8/state  certificate)

-Free Wi-fi while you wait

Cons:

-Area is kinda sketchy and finding street parking is iffy, at best.</review>

I have had my smog check done by them before when they were closer to Lincoln Ave and no complaints then. I needed a smog check and found them on Groupon, the new facility is very nice and clean (especially during these times). The appointment setup was easy and very friendly; recommend.<//review>

I brought my car to Dhillon Motorsports/Smog Man for a smog check.  This was my first time every at this shop, as it was highly recommended by colleagues at work.  This shop is awesome!  I rarely ever say this for any place after my first visit.  The owner is truly into cars, after the work was done, he spent the time to talk a bit about cars and my car specifically.<//Text>

<review>This place is great! They open early, they are super attentive, the waiting area is amazing, with coffee, snacks, tv, magazines. But most important they seem to know their stuff. I've only used them for smog-checks at the time but I am considering taking my car there for maintenance and repairs the next time I need it. Did I mention they open early? which is a great as I can drop off my car, wait and still make it to work by 8-9.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I needed my car smogged and went to my regular guy who stopped offering smog service. I couldn’t believe it.
Then I went on Yelp and found Dhillon Motorsports. I drove there without an appointment using my online coupon hassle free. From the technicians in the shop to Kathy in the office, everyone was super friendly and professional. They offer regular mechanic services too so I’ll definitely use them in the future.
The waiting room was very comfortable and they offer complimentary water and snacks which I’ve never seen before- nice touch!
They earned my business, and I hope they earn yours too.< /Review>

<Text>Always a great experience. Very friendly and is usually a quick turnaround. I work at a dealership and can get it done at work but I always get my smogs done here. Walked in Monday afternoon with no appointment (was in the area) and figured I'd see if they could get my smog done, no problem. In and out in about 30min after getting written up.

I've had smog check work performed here twice in the last couple years as required by the state of California. My experience here is limited thus far but I'm really impressed with everything about this repair shop. I have some upcoming required service and I plan on bringing them my vehicle. I'll update this review at that time.</Text>

< Review>
I had an issue trying to get my 1998 Jeep to pass the smog inspection. my mechanic fixed the car but I had to drive it 100 miles to reset the computer. Cathy advised me throughout the process, checked the computer to see that it was ready for the smog test and made the experience much less painful! Great, old-fashioned customer service and delivered on a timely basis. I highly recommend Dhillon motorsports For smog testing and other mechanical needs of your vehicles. We have seven cars in our family. We will be regular customers<//Review>

Looked all over for a reasonably priced and quick smog check with great customer service, ...and found it!  Yeah, I had a coupon, but even if I didn’t I’d probably still go there.  Not the easiest place to find, and you should call ahead of time to check how busy they are, but once you’re there, you’re in and out in 15min.  I think it’s a husband and wife team, not sure, but they know their stuff.  Highly professional and highly recommended.< /review>

<Review>Customer service is outstanding.  From the initial call to set up an appointment to the end of the smog check, everyone made you feel welcomed and happy to serve you.  The shop and office are extremely clean and the complimentary drinks and snack were a nice touch.  I would certainly recommend this place  to anyone who wants  a place they can trust.< /Review>< Pictures>

Great service from scheduling my appointment and convenient location. Their waiting area and work bays were super clean. Also got a quote on fixing a couple of things they noticed while completing my smog check. I would definitely recommend Smog Man!<//Review>

In and out within 30 min!  I walked in around 10:30 am without an appointment and left about 25 min later.  The receptionist was super friendly and professional and the office/waiting area was clean and comfy.  Bonus points for offering a coupon on their website which took the cost down by almost 50% 👍🏽
This is where I'm coming for all my smog checks in the future.<//Text>

It was the best smog testing experience I have ever had, and that’s saying a lot because we have a bunch of old cars. I especially loved a receptionist who answers phones, questions and makes appointments. They are quick and efficient and there is a comfortable waiting area. I liked it so much I went back the next day to get a car re-smogged.< /Text>

I came here because it was in my neighborhood and had an online coupon. The front desk person greeted me when I came in. Very friendly and professional staff. It took an hour to get my smog check, but I didn’t have an appointment. They also did a general check of my car, and didn’t come up with any bogus repair work needed. I’d recommend them (though you might want to make an appointment).</review>

<review>First of all, Kathy, who runs the front and back of the shop is very kind and professional. She seems to really care about your shop experience.
The service is very fast and seems very up front, knowledgeable, and honest. I will go back for more services. I would highly recommend "Smog Man".

Very professional and accommodating, especially that I called last minute and they managed to fit me in while I waited. The environment is clean, friendly and a comfortable area to wait. And this is coming from a former shop owner.  I highly recommend this company.

I brought my mother's car in for a smog and my experience with Dhillon Motorsports was the same, professional, friendly and prompt. I highly recommend this company for smog checks and all other repairs.<//review>

<Text>The best and honest service! My 95 Dakota failed smog andI didn't know what to do. So I look these guys up and came in for a diagnostic I didn't have that much money but the diagnostic was worth it. after I got my diagnostics I didn't have enough money to pay for them to actually repair the vehicle however they told me what I should try to repair and I replace the thermostat temperature sender and temperature sensor. My retest at a another smog place came back with much improved results however it was still failing on HC. I was afraid I would have to pay for another diagnostic but when I called them they said it was still included and they had no problem looking at it again. So after talking to the mechanic he suggested a few things and said he would run the diagnostic again and he called me and he said that it was good enough to pass. So I finally got my truck passed with very little money invested and I was really impressed with the customer service and how honest the mechanic was. They were willing to tell me what was wrong and not give me any kind of run around. These guys are upfront and they want to help you which is very rare in most mechanic shops. So now I still have some work to do to stop an oil leak however he help me narrow it down on what I should look for next. My truck is running great and I got my registration. I would hands-down recommend this place to anybody in the Bay area looking for an honest mechanic to help them with any smog problems. Thank you smog man you guys are absolutely awesome.</Text>< resp>

Overall had an amazing experience at Smog Man!! Right when I walked in, Kathy was very friendly and professional! I came in for a smog for my Toyota Tacoma and Kay and his team did a great job in a very quick and effective way! While I was in the waiting area I was very happy that they had a keurig and snacks for their customers! Definitely impressed!! :)</Text>

I had to get a smog check in order to turn in my registration during this COIV19 SIP and Dhillon Motorsports were very professional and used all precautions with rubber gloves, blocking off furniture and covering the seat of the car and steering wheel. Plus they did the smog in 15 minutes! A+.< /Review>

<user>108582975594689563575< /user><Review>Great service, friendly environment.
However, I have out of state registration, and they said that I can sent the smog check report to the out of state DMV to get the renewal sticker. That was wrong, each state has their own requirements, and don't accept Ca smog check report. Also, not useful in California unless the car is registered in California.
So, the smog check was not useful for me, but would recommend for within state inspections.</Review>< Rating>

I went to 8 Star Smog Inspection stations to get my 1995 Chevy Van smog tested...all said they do not do cars that old...and did not give any real explaination why. I then went to Dhillon Motorsports (formerly known as the "Smog Man")...the owner explained why other Smog shop will not do a pre 2000 car (state mandated 45 minute test) and then said he has no problem doing the longer test "HALLELUJAH "!!!!  Great professional service..and I got to tell you, they have the nicest waiting room I have ever been in! Made waiting for the test to be done very Comfortable. I am very fortunate to find this place and will definitely go back for other services also!<//Review>

I visit here frequently and have smogged many cars here. Owner and staff are respectable and do a good job at the services provided. I think more smog shops need to emulate the level of customer service here and wish this place could get the publicity it needs to grow<//review>

This place is amazing! I got the run around going to three different smog shops in San Jose that would not do my 1990 Toyota pick-up truck. I finally did some research and made a phone call to this place and was pleasntly surprised that they not only would work on my truck, but were very professional and courteous. I've had a few freinds mention they needed a smog check and told them both to go here. By far the best smog shop I've been to, hands down! Go here!< /Review>

This is a very special place.  Dhillon’s takes the friendly nature of a small neighborhood shop and pairs that with the latest staff training and high tech process.  Transparency, honesty, and communication is the culture of the facility.  The place isn’t fancy, but they have invested in the things that are important to the customer.  You can tell they clearly have an intentional and well developed business plan.  Kathy is the main customer interface.  She has enough knowledge of car repair to put to shame most mechanics at other shops.  Her real glow is her advanced customer service skills.  She seems like a natural in this role.  It is so rare these days to have an organization that respects the need to have an all around highly skilled person like her - exactly where they belong.  I found Dhillon’s because I was looking for a shop to finish an incomplete job from another shop.  From my first phone call to the time of pickup I was impressed.  The cost was clearly estimated, and the completion time delivery was as they promised.  The record keeping, communication and data collection is impressively all electronic.  Even elements of the repair process are digitally photographed in your file for off-site access!  Any questions you have about what the technician saw is easily discussed with images adding to their transparency commitment.  If you are looking for a repair shop that has reinvented the local auto repair industry - this is the place.  Dhillon’s IS a very special place.<//review>

DON'T USE THEM!

All half dozen people in the waiting area that morning failed...get that? every single customer failed!

My car passed the measured tests, but they failed me regardless of proper results because of what, in their opinion, they observed (right!). My car passed their machine, meaning it was fine, but they failed it regardless. They charged me for the failed test, and screwed up my whole day. I was there over three hours, and all they did was fail me...until I left before further extortion they attempted for proven unnecessary repairs.

I went to another smog check shop, and left there 15 short minutes later...fully, and properly, credentialed.

The flaws they reported to other customers for their cars were coincidentally similar lists to the fake diagnoses they presented to me. *EXCEPT* I recently had some of that specific work done by my regular mechanic, and it was entirely unnecessary. 100% fake.

They lied. They stalled. They kept my money.

In an age of 'pass or don't pay' smog checks, they embody 'fail and you WILL pay'.

A nightmare you should avoid. I'm filing a formal complaint with Bureau of Automotive Repair, as per the advice from multiple DMV personnel after they reviewed the Smog Man bogus test results with the honest test result I received from an honest shop shortly afterwards.

HORRIBLE!!!< /text>

<text>Just got my car smog tested here for state registration. Nice and clean waiting room. They actually has an arcade game console on site. Good time while waiting for the test to complete. You can walk in but it is always a good idea to call first. The lady replied nicely and told me how long will I need to wait. It takes less than 20 minutes for me for the whole process (Wednesday afternoon). Be sure to get their online coupon to save some extra bucks. Highly recommended.</text>< Pictures>

Went in on a Saturday. I was in and out in 20 mins and was so impressed, I brought in a second vehicle of mine in need of smog test and oil change same day. I got a full report on each vehicle before leaving and price was more than fair. I will be coming back for any test and repair needs.<//review>

These people will waste your time. Seek another place to complete your smog. Called ahead to try to make an appointment, they said an appointment wasn't necessary since they will get you in and out quickly. I said I would come in around 1PM to do the test and they agreed it wouldn't be a problem. I showed up at 1PM and the smog tech was no where to be found. Ended up wasting 40 minutes because they won't take appointments.

Depending on the day they will either pass you for the visual inspection or not. Went back and fourth multiple times to get the secondary air system into a ready state. Not a big deal to do just gotta put miles on the car. However having passed everything but that the week earlier I returned expecting the smog drama to be over but no. Now the smog tech thinks something has been tampered with despite the car being in an identical state to the previous week. Dishonest people, would not recommend.<//text>

<text>I took my BMW here and paid $135 for a oil change. I expect it to be more expensive cuz it’s a BMW.
I was told I have a coolant leak and they would send me a photo of the where the leak was. When I called back to say I never received the photo, I also asked if my fluids were topped off. They said no.
So I was just told I have a coolant leak, paid $135 for an oil change and drove off with low coolant?
I could’ve had my car overheat as I drove away from an oil change?
Even Jiffy Lube would’ve topped of the fluids.
So I went to a gas station, bought coolant and had to wait til it cooled down to put it in myself.
Thank you.
Still don’t know where the leak is?<//text>< pictures>

<text>I took my 7.3L Diesel F350 Extended Cab Dually with my Bigfoot camper here for a smog. I was worried they wouldn't do the work because of the size of my vehicle (it would not fit inside) but it was no problem for them. I was in and out in about 30 minutes.

Called ahead for waiting time, was told there was no wait.  I've been to many smog shops over the years and this was the first time there truly wasn't a wait.  I was in and out in about 15 minutes.  Fast and friendly service.  Would certainly use their service again.<//review>

Coolest Smog shop I was ever in. Enjoyed playing the sit down arcade game. Zaxxon, haven't seen that in years.  The Staff was nice, Kay (owner and smog man) was a pleasure to talk with.  He's a car aficionado.  He said he dropped out of medical school to run this shop, because he loves cars!<//Text>

<Text>I came to them back in September 2016 when I revived my current daily driver and realized I was in such a rush to get my vehicle up and running, I never left them a review. I will say their current location compared to previous one is much, much nicer, and you definitely won't miss it since it's a corner building. I rarely venture into downtown san jose, I looked at their shop location on Google Maps, found it instantly as soon as I turned off from Bird onto Auzerais.

I will definitely come back again, they've got the best deal around compared to other smog shops that are not gas station smog stations (I don't trust gas stations, just personal preference). I found a Groupon deal for a certain percentage off original price at the last second and they honored the deal, I didn't have to buy it beforehand so that definitely saved me, thanks to them. I had some free time on my hands so I went midday during the week (Thursday afternoon at the time of this posting and had smog check done at noon). I remember Kathy from my first visit, she's a super friendly lady, gave me all the info I needed both over the phone and in person. I think it took around 20-30 minutes, not bad at all considering some places I've been to takes about 45 minutes, and the technician was also incredibly nice and knowledgeable.

I am definitely recommending this place to anyone who lives locally in San Jose and those who are willing to drive out here because they took awesome care of me. Thanks Smog Man!

11/11/20: third time I've had them smog my vehicle now. Superb service as always. As an addition to taking precautions for covid, they have hand sanitizer if you don't have one on you. I'm not sure if they wear gloves but they put seat covers before getting in your car. I was told it would take a hour but I left 45 minutes after handing the keys over. Groupon did have cheaper deals but since I've had them smog my car numerous times in the past, I still came to them as I trust them with my vehicle. Thanks again smog man/dhillon motorsports!< /Text><userid>112390167225845673566</userid>< pictures>

<rate>1<//rate><text>Arrived 12:30 pm and was told 20 minutes. A nice clean well decorated shop with an A/C waiting room. However after a long wait, I noticed another customer (a couple) arriving after I did leaving before me (saw them paying twice for two smogged vehicles). After inquiring and close to two hours later, I get my vehicle back. The worst isn't over. The tech, Julian Espinoza, fail my visual inspection over a differing manufacturer part number of the catalytic converter he dug up rusting underneath. This is a 1995 vehicle I had for six years and has passed smogged in the past. So I went back to asked the original seller, who is my neighbor and a senior/veteran, and he is not aware of the non-official part installed. Good job smog man! Now I feel great for waiting two hours to be cut in line and will need to spend more time and $$$ to fix a problem I was not aware of.<//text>< Pictures>

Had a popped tire. Went in just to ask to borrow a jack but had help from the owner to change it to my spare. Definitely a place to trust.</Review>

Used these guys for years. New place is nice n clean, compared to old shop. Don’t think they do appts, not sure any smog place that does. Not a bad idea to call ahead beforehand. They have done my 2000 Chevy 2500, my 91 BMW n my 91 Alfa Romeo. Lots of shops don’t handle cars older than 99, so check before. Yelp/online discount makes it cheap. Hard to beat $40 w a shop that’s worth coming back to like this one.<//text>

I honestly have no idea why this place has any good reviews. They are expensive, slow, very poor parking, and was just given grief the whole time. Also you have to pay even if you don't pass, whereas most placed wouldn't make you pay until after. Highly suspect these positive reviews are from friends/family.<//Review>

<Text>Very polite workers. They were the cheapest place i could find, not charging extra for a pre-2000 car. They honored the Groupon price without having to buy the groupon. Paid 41.25 out the door. Very comfortable waiting area, with leather couches, tv and a video game table. Clean, despite it being a pretty sketchy neighborhood. They had a couple large dogs in crates, for "security".

Overall, a positive experience. I would return.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<review>Great place to get a smog test. The place is a little hidden. This is the second time I've taken my car here 4 smog testing. Each time was under 15 minutes in and out. They are very friendly and for $48 you can't beat it for the price and convenience. Don't forget to mention the coupon.</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>The Smog Man is the place to go if you need to get in and out quickly - no appointment needed!

It's a few bucks more than other places but I had a Groupon so it was well worth it. You do have to pay a $8.25 processing fee after the services are provided. Because they have more than one station, I was there for no more than 10 minutes. Great customer service, free water, and free wi-fi (not that you really need it..)!<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

They were very efficient: I think I only wait for 10 or 15 minutes.
Don't forget to Chek-In with Yelp to have a great discount!< /review>
