It was definitely an okay spot.
The first eyebrow wax was free and it was okay.
But for $22 every two-three weeks? Because you know your girl has dark eyebrows and they grow fast.
Threading is definitely the way to go and for less.l, regardless of where you get your eyebrows threaded.<//text>

Fruendly staff, Convenient location with close parking without having to walk through the whole mall.  Been going for almost a year.  Jade was my waxer this past time and was excellent.   Only 4 stars because bathroom faucet was broken last visit and didn't find out until my hands were all soaped.  Probably a random maintenance issue.< /review>

I tried calling the store and I'm deaf (hearing impaired) and I was trying to talk to the lady but I could barely hear what she was saying and then out of nowhere she asked "can you you hear me," hello?" And then hung up. I could tell she was faking it cause it sounded like she didn't want to talk on the phone. It's my graduation day Friday 14 at 10:30am all I wanted to do was get my eyebrows waxed now I can't even do that. That's just GREAT.</review>

<text>A corporate waxing company that falls short when it comes to customer service. The receptionist/schedulers can’t even do something as basic as change your wax pass on the computer. Buyer beware don’t buy there wax passes. Bad customer service is there corporate policy. Waxers are clean and usually well mannered.

I love EWC.  I have been a member for 3+ years and I won't get waxed anywhere else. Any EWC location has the same professional level of service and care, and the trained staff is always friendly and time-sensitive. This location is no exception!< /Text>

<review>Im super disappointed. Ive been going EWC in Anaheim for quite sometime and my girl there is gentle, professional and always checking in askng if the temp if the wax is okay, when to breathe ect. My 1st time here at mission valley i specifically asked for someone gentle and experienced. But i feel like a got a noob or someone overworked and exhausted from her day. She slathered the was on that was wayyyyy too hot, it definitely burned, and i told her a couple of times with complete disregard. And then she was just ripping it off like she was angry at it. My skin is so sensitive right now, i almost want to cry, like it hurts. If u wanted this kind of pain i would have went back to Pretty Kitty for their hot strip wax.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1543953428112, 'text': 'Hello Kitten,  I apologize for the service you received on your last visit.

<user_id>103547591962185315890<//user_id><text>I hate to do this because the service was friendly, but the wax is just not for me, i feel like threading my eyebrows leaves my brows on highlight part more clean looking. I did get the wax for free the first visit, that was nice. The only thing was, i almost felt like my eyebrows turned out the same.  I did like that it was very private, it was a room like a room at a Dr, s visit with a big flat table you lay on, almost felt like i was going for a private check, but only for my eyebrows. ;]</text>< GmapID>

Found my eyebrow girl. I don't wax much else so finding someone whose eyebrow game is on....matters! Took 3 EWCs to finally find the right one.< /text>

Wax on, wax off. Hair removal from head to toe, including but not limited to eyebrows, chin, ears, nose, legs, back and Brazilian. Walk in, strut out is their motto...and who doesn't love strutting? Body builders are regular clients here.< /review>

don’t give them attitude back or they might drop you as a patient, if you really think it’s worth going there just bite your tounge even if they’re treating you sarcastically and making faces and almost degrading you. Just know there are better services out there. Not worth the time. I’ve been coming here since I had my child because it’s where they sent me and I wish I changed sooner. They are there for a reason and they should be able to relay information politely with the patient if that’s what they want in return. bless them.< /Text>

This is the best clinic that I've ever been to! The doctor and nurses are super friendly, and they offer free transportation! They also express that they really care and make you feel at home. I would recommend this place to anyone! :)))<//review>

<review>I am 29 weeks pregnant and 2 days. I stopped coming to this clinic because the assisted transportation provided by San Juda’s made me late to my scheduled appointment at the clinic. The nurses and doctor made me wait 3 and a half hours even though I had a scheduled appointment for the day. I brought it up to EVERYONE’S attention (nurses and doctor) yet EVERYONE said they couldn’t do anything but allow EVERYONE who was ahead of me to be seen. My appointment was scheduled for 10AM and I was seen until 12:30PM. Disgusting and rude! Not to mention anyone hardly speaks English so if you aren’t bilingual or speak fluent Spanish-you will be finding this clinic very difficult to get by. When I finally got to see the doctor she needed me to update her upon my file. She didn’t remember my ultrasound date, updates doctor visits I’ve provided, and my updated due date. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL and ridiculous! ANY doctor should know about their own clients file and paperwork. Since then I’ve never returned and have been in between OBGYN’s due to their poor customer service. Sad ANYONE has to feel this way about a doctors office/clinic- especially while pregnant! I DON’T RECOMMEND YOU WASTE YOUR TIME HERE ALL DAY AND BOTHER BEING JUDGED. After not being able to pick up my breast pump due to poor communication skills AGAIN by a nurse here at this location, she updated me that every other nurse on-site spoke about my situation about me no longer wanting services due to wait time. What type of clinic, nurses, and doctors GOSSIP about their clients they’re receiving their pay from? Seriously, don’t come here please! You’d be doing yourself, family, friends, and most importantly your baby a favor! They only care about your money and insurance<//review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I've been coming here for years now(Because with my insurance its a process to change clinics) Every time i come it gets worst. I tried to get my appointments at 8am (the time they open). I end up getting help like about 30-40 minutes later. I've notice the staff is always late. I think they need to fix this and learn how to multitask.  Staff are not well qualified to do this. They are always talking when they open in the morning when they should be worrying about getting things done.</Review>

Horrible do not go here if you are pregnant, slow service, the staff had attitude problems. They say service is free but that's a lie, good thing I have medical. The transportation is super slow, if you are not Hispanic this clinic act like they don't want to see you. My experience here was horrible the restroom was nasty and the waiting room was dirty this clinic need to be shut down.</review>

This place sucks. What's the point of setting up an appointment and they see you 4hrs later. People have other things to do then to sit and wait to be seen. THE WAIT IS RIDICULOUS!!< /review>

<user_name>Eden Jacobo Ramirez<//user_name><Review>Doctors,nurses are great . My PROBLEM is always with the transportaion department. The lady jessica has made me miss 3 appointments, almost 4,but no i made sure i was not goimg to miss anymlre because this lady wants to do what ever she wants. It would of been ok if those are clinic rules but no she just has attitude. Then you want to complain to someone else and either she says manager is not atound, or when the manager is around they both are the same. Jessica lies everytime making patients beleive we didnt amswer phones to miss appoimments saying they were outside and left. No never true , i always wait outside noone ever shows up. Talks to tranportation drivers veeeery rude . Clinic is great they do take a while but honestly transportation is baaaad</Review>< user>

Terrible. My 3rd time today coming in this year to try to get my birth control. Rude front desk would rather gossip then welcome patients and designate to correct sign in sheet. They refuse to service me without a doctors permission although the doctor who helped me before mentioned there should be no problem. OPEN on fridays with NO DOCTOR..Never coming back.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad but bad service I do not recommend it at all, nurses from the children's area heavy and bitter, I arrived for my appointment at 840 and they attended me at 2:30 because I was pressuring them because not even the children called me one of 3 and 5 years without eating, just because of all those people, I arrived 10 minutes late and that's why the reception nurses grabbed her with me because I told them why they didn't call me and she said that it was going to happen without an appointment and they never called me the nurse thought it affected me but it was not the children who waited until 3 to have lunch, terrible service

(Original)
Muy mal pero mal servicio no la recomiendo para nada, enfermeras del área de niños pesadas y amargadas, llegué a mi cita a las 8 40 y me han atendido a las 2 y media porque las estuve presionando porque ni tansiquiera me llamaron los niños uno de 3y 5 años sin comer, solo por culpa de todo ese personas, llegué 10 minutos tardes y por eso las enfermeras de recepción la agarraron conmigo porque les dije que porque no me llamaban y dijo que ya hiba a pasar como sin cita y nunca me llamaron la enfermera pensó que me afectaba a mi pero no eran a los niños que esperaron hasta las 3 para poder almorzar, pésimo servicio< /review>

(Translated by Google) 4 hours and a half, waiting for my results, so that they only told me they are normal !!! I am worried about my health, and it only says that the results are normal and that they only have 10 minutes per patient !!! That shows that they are more interested in money, than the health of their patients! The attitude of the receptionists is the worst! Do not go here!

<Text>(Translated by Google) Do not go to this place, from your own experience. 10 months ago I went to my pap smear, I went back to my results and they went back to normal, what they "the nurses" referred me to with a "doctor" in another place for a biopsy, that doctor didn't do his job well, I got hurt from that place and only told me: "you are very sensitive, I can not do a biopsy, return in another year to another pap smear."! He saw me as nothing and left the office and I was crying because it hurt a lot. Three days after I went with him, I went to the general hospital emergency room and they found a strange tissue that was hurting me and I already had a severe infection that the doctor told me was an emergency. She told me that she did not understand how that doctor did not perform the biopsy if everything seemed to be ready. He told me to go back to demand the biopsy because it didn't look good. But I told him that I was afraid to return because it hurt me so much. And she referred me to specialists in the general hospital. They tried to communicate with him many times and they did not get it, they did all the exams again but they told me to go to the San Judas clinic, where they initially found me the abnormal exam, and when I went to get help they became the underserved, They treated me badly and did not want to give me my medical records, which by law correspond to me. I went three times and they only spoke to me with words of intimidation so that I would not continue asking for my files. In the end I told them that I would complain and just like that, just like that! They handed them to me. Two women locked me in a room and did not let my companion in and made me sign a paper as they were not responsible in case of a lawsuit !!! I had a concern for my health and they didn't help me but made me feel bad! In the end I tell them and I hope they see this. In the general hospital I was diagnosed with cervical cancer and had it not been because I went to the emergency room at this time the cancer would have advanced further! If I had stayed with the "come back in a year from the biopsy doctor" maybe they could not have done anything for me. Now I am still in recovery at the general hospital LAC + USC where they provided all the help very professionally. Many people tell me why not demand them? But right now my health comes first, and it would be very tedious to walk in these procedures. This place is not recommended.

(Original)
No vayan a este lugar, por experiencia propia. Hace 10 meses fui a mi papanicolao, regrese por mis resultados y salieron a normales, a lo que ellas “las enfermeras” me refirieron con un “doctor” en otro lugar para una biopsia, ese doctor no hizo bien su trabajo, salí lastimada de ese lugar y solamente me dijo: “estás muy sensible, no puedo hacerte biopsia, regresa en un año a otro papanicolao.”! Me vio como nada y se salió del consultorio y yo me quede llorando porque me dolía mucho. A los 3 días de haber ido con el, fui a emergencias en el hospital general y encontraron un tejido extraño que me estaba lastimando y tenía ya una infección severa que la doctora se emergencias me dijo que era peligrosa. Ella misma me dijo que no entendía como ese doctor no me realizó la biopsia si todo se veía que ya estaba listo. Me dijo que regresara allá a exigir la biopsia porque no se veía bien. Pero le dije que tenía miedo de regresar porque me lastimó mucho. Y ella me refirió con especialistas en el hospital general. Ellos intentaron comunicarse con el muchas veces y no lo consiguieron, me hicieron de nuevo todos los exámenes pero me dijeron que fuera a la clínica San Judas, donde inicialmente me encontraron el examen anormal, y cuando fui a buscar ayuda ellos se hicieron los desentendidos, me trataron mal y no querian entregarme mis archivos médicos, que por ley me corresponden. Fui en tres ocasiones y ellos sólo me hablaban con palabras de intimidación para que yo no siguiera pidiendo mis archivos. Al final les dije que iría a quejarme y sólo asi, solo así! Me los entregaron. Me encerraron dos mujeres en un cuarto y no dejaron entrar a mi acompañante y me hicieron firmar un papel según que ellos no eran responsables en caso de una demanda!!! Yo tenía una preocupación por mi salud y ellas no me ayudaron sino que me hicieron sentir mal! Al final les digo y espero que ellos vean esto. En el hospital general fui diagnosticada con cancer cervical y de no haber sido porque fui a emergencias a esta hora el cancer ya hubiera avanzado más!!! Si yo me hubiera quedado con el “regresa en un año del doctor de la biopsia” quizás no hubieran podido hacer nada por mi. Ahora sigo en recuperación en el hospital general LAC+USC donde si me brindaron toda la ayuda muy profesionalmente. Mucha gente me dice que porque no los demande? Pero en estos momentos mi salud es lo primero,  y sería muy tedioso andar en esos trámites. Este lugar no es recomendable.</Text>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) IT'S CLINICAL I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT THE PLACE IS VERY DIRTY. AND THE TREAT THAT THEY GIVE TO ONE IS AS IF THEY WERE BEING FREE. AND ALSO WANT TO BE EXAMS THAT NEITHER EVEN NEEDS ONE. THEY ARE ONLY GOOD TO REMOVE YOUR MONEY. THE RECEPTIONISTS IN MY FIRST OPINION HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO TREAT PEOPLE. WHY IT SEEMS THAT THEY ARE STILL IN HIS RANCH. THE WORD RESPECT AND KINDNESS DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS !!! THEY NEED A GOOD TRAINING OR SIMPLY TO CLOSE THE CLINIC AND STOP THE MONEY IN OUR OWN FACE. THEY ARE SIRVERGUENZAS THAT STEAL YOU VERY EASY PLEASE RUN THE VOICE .. Thank you !!

SOLO SON BUENOS PARA SACARTE TU DINERO. LAS RECEPCIONISTAS EN MI OPINIÓN PRIMERO TIENEN QUE SABER CÓMO TRATAR A LAS PERSONAS. PORQUÉ   PARECE QUE TODAVÍA ESTÁN EN SU RANCHO . LA  PALABRA RESPETO Y AMABILIDAD NO CONOCEN QUE ES!!! NECECITAN  UN BUEN ENTRENAMIENTO O SIMPLEMENTE QUE CIERREN LA CLÍNICA Y DEJEN DE ROBARNOS EL DINERO EN NUESTRA PROPIA CARA.

I only went for a blood test, they robbed me $ 35 practically charged me for sitting and when the supposed doctor saw me it was not more than 5 minutes I was sent to the breath and I got the resepcionista with exam prices that I was not asking for. The resepcionista was very bad and nothing nice is believed to be the owner. Typical Latina is only a resepcionista and is already believed to be a DOCTOR

(Translated by Google) It does not work, it takes a long time to help you, the nurses prefer to talk to the people, then they do not give you what you were ... it does not work

<Review>(Translated by Google) Bad service. I don't know if they exploit them but they are angry. They are not organized. And doctors lsv. And between them, their mistakes are justified.
If you want to ask for proof for your worker. Here they will give it to you very late but they will give it and reluctantly. And parking is limited. And not everyone speaks Spanish. and let's confirm pregnancy. And we left at 4 o'clock and not even people

(Original)
Mal servicio. No se si las explotan pero andan enojadas. No estan organizados. Y doctoras lsv. Y entre ellas se justifican.sus errores disiendo ES RUTINA.
Si quieren pedir comprobante para su trabajador. Aqui se lo daran tardisimo pero se lo daran y de mala gana. Y el parqueo es limitado. Y no todos hablan español. e ivamos a confirmar embarazo. Y salimos a las 4 horas y ni personas abian< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>Donte is so helpful. I know I can always get the help I need from him at this sprint location. I've had my phone service with sprint for over 10 years now, and I'm finally happy with the customer service I receive. Thank you!</Review>< username>

<review>Impressive customer care! I went to the store to change my plan, and Phil made things very easy! He walked me through all my options, and focused on what would save me the most money. Surprisingly, I was eligible for an upgrade, so he helped me pick out a new phone. He devoted a lot of time and effort to make sure I was comfortable with my decision, and I knew every thing about my monthly bill.

The whole team was really on their game. They were very thoughtful and turned what could have been a frustrating experience into a fun social hour. During the final phases of the transaction, they experienced a technical issue that required the manager to call IT help. Phil was aware that this was going to require a wait so he offered to get coffee. It was a perfect break! By the time we came back, the manager had fixed the issue and we were ready to go!

Thank you so much, Phil and Capitola team! You are all amazing! Can't wait to come back to pick up my new tablet! :)<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<review>If I could give ZERO STARS I would.
I came to Sprint after many years with Verizon.
Since June 2016 I have been waiting for them to send me and my wife our Verizon contract buy put.
Every time I talk with the numerous managers they say "it's been escalated". "I will call you tomorrow". Do not believe it.
They took my phones, I have given them paperwork twice.
I HAVE NOT ONCE BEEN CALLED BACK.
I even talked with the District Manager 2 weeks ago , Pat Coniglio, "I'll call you back tomorrow". That never happened.
It's like they want to push you so hard that you'll snap and do something that lands you in jail.
LET THE BUYER BEWARE
Thanks for all your crappy service.
"The bitterness of poor service outlasts the sweetness of an imagined good deal".
Thanks Pat I thought you would be different.</review><rate>1</rate>< gmapID>

My wife & I just switched to Sprint & we each got a phone & our own line. We tried to get connected to Sprint online, but had a very bad experience. Going to the store & meeting Phil Atkinson was our very last effort to switch to Sprint.  Phil was absolutely magnificent, so easy to work with, so knowledgeable, & so easy to understand. He was a real joy to work with. We are recommending to all our friends, that they should also switch to Sprint & go & get Phil's assistance. He hope that Sprint management will show appreciation to Phil & raise his salary & get him some more help there in the Capitola store.< /Review>

<review>We were lied to after thoroughly asking about our out the door price, they added on another 35$.  One year later lied to about receiving a new phone (not refurbished) for insurance. Low and behold they gave me a refurbished phone. Record your conversations. The manager and the employees tell you what you want to hear to get you on contract. Be ready for spending 5 hours at this store as myself, my wife and a friend has all done.</review>< pics>

This place can't do anything with you Sprint phone or account.  Have tried a couple of times to make account changes at this location but they are not a corporate store and really can't do anything but sell you a phone.
Overall Sprint is the worst rated phone company and spending any time discussing service quality with a Sprint customer will tell you everything you need to know about why you shouldn't choose Sprint.<//Text>

<Date>1479640653828<//Date><review>Pushy sales staff. They don't care about you, they just want you to give them a perfect score on the post visit survey. They told me, "Anything less than a perfect score is a fail, you don't want me to fail do you?" Word to the wise, I do not want you to fail but I don't want a guilt trip either. During the sale I felt like they would say whatever they thought I wanted to hear in order to sell me on more and more expensive merchandise. Unless there is some kind of miracle or they do something to make up for this unacceptable, obnoxious behavior I will not go here again.

Phil Atkinson, Asst. Mgr went ABOVE and BEYOND to make that happen for me, and for that I am eternally grateful. He sat on the phone with customer care to get that lock removed. We don't know yet if it will all work out, but thank you isn't enough.< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>Worst customer service ever. RUDE. Phil helped me buy my phone. (At which time he explained nothing about my new phone and I had never had an I Phone) . He also told me what I needed instead of giving options to me. I switched from wifi to cable internet. My phone quit working. Apparently there are NO Sprint towers in my area. I called corporate. They said my account should have never been opened with no coverage. They are going to wave the rest I owe on my phone and told me to take it to the store for a refund. Phil was working. I had printed out the chat with the corporate saleslady to point out some things. He got very angry and rude and said that none of them were true. I asked him to call the manager. He pretended to but did not. We then asked to call corporate with him. 3 times in a row he said it would just frustrate us more and be a waste of our time. By the time we called they were closed. I have filed a formal complaint, and so has the head office. I have never been talked to in such a manner where I am spending my money. Phil seems to have an anger problem. BUT, that's not my problem.< /Review>< date>

<Pics>None< /Pics><review>My partner and I were attempting to take advantage of the online Sprint deal for one year of free cell service if you switch from another carrier. After a very lengthy process online, our new sim cards came in one day, and following the directions, we tried to activate our phones online. Several frustrating hours later, we were told we needed to go to the Sprint store in Capitola to activate the phones.
Amanda, George, and Trey worked with us for two hours to make the online deal work. We were on the phone with customer care for over an hour, and without the staff's careful help and guidance, nothing would have worked. They really advocated for us every step of the way, shared our frustration, and kept both their patience and their humor. Five huge stars for all three, and we'll keep our fingers crossed about our experience with Sprint as we begin our free year.</review><resp>None< /resp>< userid>

<Review>Terrible!

We came in an hour before closing to look at upgrade options. I was told we’d receive a $15 credit on my Hulu bill, and that was the same cost for new phones, great! This was the manager that assured me. He then had us work with Tre....

Tre was unprofessional to say the least. He complained about his hourly pay to us and joked about how he wasn’t going to do anything the manager just asked him to do. He wasn’t paying attention to what he was doing, and when I logged into my new phone he said I was logging into too many accounts so we had to set mine up the old school way.

An hour after they closed my phone still wasn’t ready. He told me to come back at 10 Am the next day and that I couldn’t take the new or old phone with me! I took my old phone.

After we get home we realize, while my fiancé has his Apple ID on his new phone, he has my phone number! Tre put my number into his phone and created the 2 hour delay that day.

The next day, show up at 10:15. A trainee is there and he says my new phone is ready. We explain the mix up, and he doesn’t have authorizations and we need to wait for Tre who should be there in 10 minutes. Tre doesn’t show up until 11:20! No wonder you get paid what you do! He literally shrugged sorry to me when I asked what happened to 10AM and then said maybe two words after. I asked for a managers card and I got the stores number.... helpful. You were just in there joking about your email accounts, so I know he has an email. If you haven’t been fired yet it’s only a matter of time.

Two weeks later I get the text to add Hulu. We have the Unlimited Package with Hulu which I told the Sprint Manager, and that’s apparently not eligible for the discount. So the entire reason I went through all this BS is because I was told my budget wouldn’t change; you got me and the sale. Great job!

I prefer not to deal with any Sprint store because I’ve never had a positive experience ever, but Sprint won’t allow me to upgrade online. When I mentioned this to the manager, he jokingly said “you should come in here anyways just see us!” Never again, you guys suck! And this is exactly why I didn’t want to come in; told you so.</Review>< rate>

The staff are not friendly especially the manager. We went to another location and the staff seem to cater to only their fellow Hispanics. We signed in yet people that just got there who did not sign in but were Hispanics were seen first. Not a good place.<//text>

So lazy all they care about is selling if any other issue they just say go to a corporate store. I worked for sprint for a long time 3rd party and you can do everything. There was a young mexica. Guy that was tryinv to help but this mixed girl was just sitting there say no you can't do that. Just complete laziness don't waste your time coming here!!!< /Review>

<Review>The store has new staff, service has diminished. It's a 3rd party retailer. It's service center has left, basically you just buy phones and accessories. The true problem is still with a Sprint company itself and the lack of quality cell service in Santa Cruz County.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Probably the worst experience I’ve had with any cellphone associate. Staff was extremely unhelpful and constantly goofing around. The most unprofessional establishment I’ve ever stepped foot in.< /text>

<Text>I'm not big on fudge. But they have plenty for you to choose from. I am giving them 5 stars for the young ladies working in there being nice and their fresh baked pretzels being soft and delicious!! Comes with a cheese spread. Yum! They are good size also. Looking for a soft, fresh pretzel 🥨 this is the place!< /Text><response>None</response><Date>1610935796976</Date>< rate>

I feel terrible for posting this, but i’m just so surprised by the reviews that are ONLY recommending the fudge. It’s overly sweet, crumbly and definitely not the best fudge i’ve had. I asked for the lovely servers recommendation, and she helped me pick the “least” sweet option which was the dark chocolate walnut fudge. TOO SWEET, and more condensed milk than chocolate.<//text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I recently went to a wedding where Old Danish Fudge Kitchen provided the party favors and I was blown away by how delicious the fudge is! It looked so good that everyone at my table snuck a bite before the salad course was finished. I've heard countless friends and locals sing the praises of Old Danish before and can confirm that the sweet treats did not disappoint. The fudge was so good that I ate the rest of it first thing the next morning. Three words: Breakfast. Of. Champions.< /Text>< Pics>

Cute All-American/Danish fudge shop!  The fudge is delicious and they sell a bunch of other candies to delight your sweet tooth.  Also, attached to the Fudge Kitchen is the Old Danish Food Farm, Ice Cream & Hot Dog Shop. I didn't try one of their hot dogs but I did have an ice cream cone which was very creamy and delicious!</review>

I didn’t actually come in for the fudge although I will try it next time, I actually came in for the pretzels! 🥨 🥨 🥨 They are fresh, warm, delicious and so soft and fluffy! Really good pretzel in Solvang if your ever craving pretzels!! I also bought Salt Water Taffy’s and they are delicious too as well as the Peanut Brittles!<//Review>

A quaint little shop in a quaint little town. The fudge is made so that it will not melt, which is perfect since temperatures can be quite warm in So-Cal and you rarely just drive to Solvang to pick up fudge and leave. This allows you to meander through the streets without ending up with a puddle of sugar.

Fudge is sold here by the slice, not the square. (Side note: "slice" in this context sounds dainty and delicate. It is no more dainty and delicate than using a chainsaw to widdle.)  The price is very reasonable - $5 to $6 per slice. We sampled a couple before settling on Chocolate Orange. It's quite rich, but smooth as can be. A little goes a long way.<//text>

The owner and staff are so friendly. Plus, they are doing an excellent job of adhering to Covid safety measures. A must stop if you are in Solvang or passing through.</Text>< pics>

<text>Pretty nice little shop.  If you're a fudge or chocolate craver, then you must pop in here.
Everything is made here and you can even watch them making the fudge from time to time.
Prices are reasonable and the slices are large.
Flavor is very good, albeit a little too sweet (for me).< /text>< Rate>

<time>1525459545783</time><review>I don’t really even like fudge! I stopped by at the urging of a friend. The selection is great, so many different flavors, something for everyone! The dark chocolate raspberry is my new favorite! My only complaint however, was the young man behind the counter seemed indifferent to helping me or answering any questions. But other than that I love this place and I know you will too! So even if you don’t like fudge give it a shot you may be like me and become a convert!< /review><Rating>3< /Rating><user_id>103115164515139734461< /user_id>< name>

A fudge kitchen that doesn’t know what fudge is.
The “fudge” is just liquid sugar. And yet it comes in a bar that is rock solid on the outside. It could only be like this because it has been there exposed to the air for weeks. Cut into it and is just runny sugary watery liquid.
No resemblance to real fudge, only sugar went into these, not good butter, condensed milk, or anything rich and creamy like that.<//text>

The orange chocolate fudge, Rocky Road, Dark Chocolate with Pecans and Plain Dark Chocolate are so yummy! My only complaint is that when I visit I ask one of the gals in the back who was stuffing some red cinnamon gummy bears if I could taste one. She said No. My husband loves cinnamon candy. so I thought it would be a nice treat for him. I wanted to taste it and maybe buy more. I mentioned this to her because what if I don't like it. She still said no. How sad because my husband loved them and so did I . If she would of let me try one,  I would of bought at least four more bags.My humble suggestion to the owner or store  manager, If your customer is purchasing items why not provide them with a sample if they request it. You know they are going to like it and will end up purchasing  more. You are missing out on more sales. Your stuff is good; I was already purchasing 4 flavors of fudge perhaps not a pocket breaker, but  i would of bought more.< /text>

<text>Been purchasing fudge from Old Danish Fudge Kitchen for decades. A mandatory Solvang stop mostly on two wheels Harley rather than on four wheels.

I recently moved to AZ from SoCa.
My Prescott AZ Realtor Des H from Klein Properties received Old Danish fudge for the Holidays. She sent me a thank you note letting me she's nuts about chocolate and thought the fudge was "yummy". This fudgery handles lots of online orders. My friends/clients are always happy to receive delicious fudge. The fudge puts smiles on many faces.< /text>< UserId.>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>The food here was pretty good. My group ordered a wide verity of things (ravioli, salads, flat bread, burgers). For the most part, we were satisfied in that area. Emily was FANTASTIC!!!! Why three stars? The problem is that Emily wasn't our waitress. It was... hmmm I don't remember her name. She was non-existent.

Even after Emily ordered our drinks, brought out our food, and checked on us for refills, our non-existent waitress still had to be hunted down for our bill.

The place wasn't that busy...

Thank you Emily for keeping this from being a 1 star night. It was a Wednesday night.</Review>< pics>

Bartenders really good (Avonna, Rene, Larry).  Grilled artichoke side is a thing even though it's not on menu and worth ordering.   Bar lights up and casts an accusing shadow on breasts.  My breasts see four lights not five.<//Text>

<review>The servers are inattentive and rude, and the bar's beer selection is sub-par. Our server was close to nonexistent for most of the evening, then had the nerve to demand we pay the tab for the table next to us who left when she failed to respond to their request to settle their bill for more than an hour. The staff is devoid of both people skills and hospitality skills. This is a grossly mismanaged excuse of a restaurant and bar which disgraces the DoubleTree Hotel name.  The Vintage Plus Band is enjoyable to attend, but I'd rather see the band at a venue where the staff shows a reasonable measure of respect for their customers.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1535384803373, 'text': "Dear Mr. Vandigrifft,\n\nThank you for your Google + review.

This is for the owner of Bistro 880

Atmosphere and service is good. Just wanted to pass on that your menu is misleading. You labeled chicken and salmon as a Vegan item. And also all your vegetarian option are labeled vegan but they contain dairy. Very important, your Kale Cesar actually had no Kale, it was all Arugula. And your beers are spelled incorrect. All easy fixes I hope you get to see this post. Everyone should give this place a shot< /text>

Inconsistent dining experience. Breakfast lack variety and slow to top up food tray. Quality of food is so-so, slow service, two stars only.</Review>

<Review>Was there for a dinner on a Friday night. The place and the band looks good. the servers are not at all friendly/smiley, not inviting and especially the food is horrible. We ordered two dishes one is the Grilled Salmon, which seems to be very itchy when eaten for the entire family (not for just one). The shrimp and Ravoli, is also terrible as for the entire dish we have to search for the shrimp which are like the samllest I have ever seen. May the bar is good but not advisable for dining at this place.</Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Honestly, I'm only staying here because it's affordable at this point. So many inspections have happened within the year I've stayed here. I've never had a complex management in my apartment so much. They've enter without my permission, which they have said they left a notice, and no. I check the damn door just in case everyday because I'm used to these inspections at this point. Its an open parking lot at this point, the gates are never shut and now they have installed surveillance cameras at the entrances. The cops are always here. At first, i raved about this place. It's beautiful. Appearances are deceiving, I guess. It used to be no guess parking, but since the gates allow anyone it's a free for all for parking. They've towed my car and we had to get it back, and I still don't understand why-- management said one reason and the tow company said a totally different. It is what it is. I'm not leaving yet, but counting down until I can find something better. Overall, location is fine. UPS DOES NOT DELIVER here. Office staff is mediocre, nothing special.<//Text>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>I honestly dont recommend this apartment complex (Bella Park) i had a bad experience after living there for 3 years reasons are,,(1)in this year they went up on the rent twice for what reason dont know. (2) Every time something  went out like the a.c or the dish washer or something broke i would call them and they wouldnt show up till two weeks later sometimes up to a month to come and get it fix, also had personal things come up missing, and the staff there at the office specially kelly would  always say ohh where going to take care of it and would never here from them again. The period of time i was there roaches and ants never went away even tho they service it me pesonally i say Poor maintance service. And thats the reason i dont live there no more cause i have kids. Your probably are asking your self why was i there for so long it was money wise but got a better job and left out there it was like hell living there.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Staff is EXTREMELY rude. Please replace kelly It’s like they’re mission is for u NOT to renew ur lease. Every 5 weeks they randomly turn off the water. Than they boosted the rent up like 300 after the first year. If you park ur car in visitors it will get towed. One of the worst complex In rialto<//Text>< pics>

<text>I lived there from March 2015 to December 2015 and I paid $800 monthly for a 1 bedroom. I had a good experience. No bug problems inside and maintenance never took longer than 3 days to come by. The only thing I really had a problem about is on my move out date they wouldn't allow me to do the walk through inspection with them and in result I only got about $230 back from my $800 deposit and when I say I left that apartment just about spotless! That was my biggest issue.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

I've been here since 2012 and have to admit the only problem I had was the people can be ghetto but as long as the complaint is legit something does happen to the tenants...It went from Quail Ridge to Bella Park in the past couple years and changes for the better...No infestation at all..they have pest control come every Monday to spray and leave traps throughout the complex, maintenance is round the clock especially in emergencies, Pool is opened during office hours because people can be irresponsible and they don't take of nothing, we have security drive around during the night, they offer after school programs for your kids, parking stickers only for your car up to date on its registration and insurance under your name, oh and paid trash, gas, and water...I love my hot showers...Downfall, some ghetto people after hours, once in a while they need to do maintenance if a water heater breaks down(which is very few times since I been here!!) and you can't keep your patio cluttered with your stuff to maintain people being ghetto...all around great apt. Let them know I referred you!!! Lol it's a good apartment..< /text>

<review>I have lived here since March 2015. I don't really have much to complain about; although I will say that the only issue for me are the pool hours. Especially during the summer! The pool is only open during office hours so basically Monday through Saturday from 8 to 5.
Umm, Im not 100% sure but I would say about 90% of the people who live here work during those hours and by the time we get home it is too late to enjoy an afternoon in the pool. I get home around 5:15 and I can't take my kids to the pool because the office is closed which means the pool is closed. Even on Sundays when most of us have a day off from work and would like to enjoy a pool day with your family, we are unable to because like I mentioned earlier if the office is closed the pool is closed as well.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Not to mention how loud and ghetto it is. The front gate is always breaking down too, so you can't even come in or get out. I can't wait for my lease to end so I can move out.<//Text><Date>1454871514176</Date><user>109112764733410666929<//user><Resp>None< /Resp><Rating>1<//Rating><Name>Leticia Mercado</Name><pics>None<//pics></record>

<Text>First of all for all of those saying it’s roach infested it’s not they probably brought them in when they moved over here I’m going on 3 yrs here and I’ve seen about 5 if even...  and about the notices yes they do leave them I’ve gotten them too when I have toys or things on the patio but I think it’s ok because it doesn’t look so ghetto I have two little kids and they play outside there is cameras everywhere I do constantly go outside to check up on them but it’s not as bad as they say.. and yes the rents go up but I’ve looked around and it’s about the same everywhere and other places are worse. I like it here and I’ve never once had a problem with anyone from management and trust me I can have an attitude. Issues you’ll have everywhere if you don’t want roaches keep your place clean as for weed yes I hate that smell too but unfortunately for our bad luck now it’s legal so  sure everywhere we go that will Be an issue<//Text>< Pics>

It would be worth 4 stars if they had a gym and the manager is okay no issues yet. but they should let guest to park in the parking area not out on the streets. I hear the manager was gonna build a gym but I hope so.<//text>< Pics>

We moved in since April of 2014, and had issue with bugs. The office told us if we had that issue, report it and they will send someone to spray. They would only spray on the outside of the building, never inside where the bugs are in. The new managers are RUDE! ever since they remolded the outside of the building, the insides stayed the same. There starting to let rude ass people move in with here children that bully other kids here, a lot of families moved out because of that. There are always people parking in the carports and smoking weed, Even through out the whole complex, cant even have your windows open because you always get the smell of weed coming through. Bella Park Apartments, is not a place to move into especially if you have kids, take them some where else not here, it's worth paying the extra.</Text>

<Text>I've lived here for three years and in that time I've had a child. I've asked them repeatedly to change the carpets because of the wear and tear. They said  that the only time they renovate  any type of thing in your apartment is when a tenant moves out. The carpet is no longer attached to the floor! I would not recommend these apartments especially since they raised the rent.</Text>< name>

Worst place to live the first month that we moved in there was already gunshots they stole my brother's car twice in side the property management didn't do nothing about it we moved out as soon as we where  able to they kept the deposit they are charging us 812 Moore I'm okay with paying l simple damages that we did left in the apartment but just people are just way too much so let's add up the numbers 1150 + 805 + 75 + 90 + 325 + 260+ 60 +30 +32+ 35 and 100 I wouldn't if you guys don't want to lose your money or go bankruptcy don't rent at this place.</Text>

Ok so these apts are nice from the front and you may think it's a good place to live but once you drive back it's super ghetto and the speed bumps are ridiculous there is no parking for ur visitors so they have to park outside the apts.
They're always towing cars it's stupid >:l
The cops been here 2 times in 1 week. They are recently renovated but they need to clean out the ppl who live here. There's always bums walking by. Don't be fooled by how pretty it's looks from the front office...<//review>

OMG!!! These apts are over priced. They remodel the outside, but what about the inside. We do not llive outside, although I feel like I do. The inside has soooooo many roaches not just in mine, I've talked to plenty of neighbors and they are dealing with them too. And when I call the office they acct like its OK to be living with roaches. Worse place to live!!! i give them no stars.<//text>

(Translated by Google) I have been in these apartments since April 2020 and I do not recommend them, I have not left due to the contract I have with them, as long as I have been here there are always problems with the water service, I know it has gone like 5 times in a month, one day we were all day without electricity, many people were sleeping in the cars, many insects, my husband bought a car at night and when we got up the crane had already taken it, they have no consideration in the middle of the pandemic, the laundry is very expensive to have old equipment, to recharge the laundry card you have to go to the office and they do not accept $ 1 bills among other things, it has been the worst experience I have had in an apartment in the US .... very nice the place but lousy service.

(Original)
Llevo desde abril 2020 en estos apartamentos y no los recomiendo, no me he ido debido al contrato que tengo con ellos, en lo que llevo aquí siempre hay problemas con el servicio de agua ya sé ha ido como 5 veces en un mes, un día estuvimos todo el día sin luz muchas personas anduvieron durmiendo en los carros, muchos insectos, mi esposo se compro un carro en la noche y cuando nos levantamos ya la grúa se lo había llevado, no tienen consideración en medio de la pandemia, la lavandería es muy costosa como para que tengan equipos viejos, para recargar la tarjeta de lavandería hay que ir a la oficina y no aceptan billetes de $1 entre otras cosas más, ha sido la peor experiencia que he tenido en apartamento en EU....muy bonito el lugar pero pésimo servicio.< /Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Horrible they do nothing when you post a report, loud neighboring marijuana with loud music from 6:30 am, and those in the office do nothing to stop that, it is not a good place to live, since I arrived I had problems with the neighbors they are marijuana and the aroma was penetrating my apartment, it is not a good place for children

<Text>The good thing is during these uncertain times, covid-19 the economy and the economy because of covid-19. One of the good things is that if you oh, you can get up some privacy move in with someone family friends. Store your stuff somewhere that you know will be safe you hold the key to your own lock. The place is well maintained 24-hour surveillance I recommend this place Batman out.!</Text><name>Roderick Garcia<//name><gmapID>0x80dce8d8899952ff:0xf592df5d2c3c1484<//gmapID>< Rate>

<Review>We have been customers of this Public Storage location for many years.  The staff is always friendly, professional and efficient.

Last week we needed to move from a smaller space into a larger one and Miguel was very helpful in assisting us in choosing a new unit as well as getting all of our information updated into the system.

On the day we moved units, there was quite a bit of construction traffic on the property which was making it difficult to drive from one unit to the next.  Due this, we did not think we would be able to complete our move that day.  I spoke with Ashley in the office and she was extremely empathetic to the situation and assured us she would do what she could in order for us to move into our new space and as it turned out, we were able to finish our move that day!  Ashley (as well as the construction crews) we very accommodating and key to us being able to get everything done.

Thank you Ashley and Miguel for everything!  Your customer service is one of the reasons we choose to stay with this location of Public Storage!<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<rate>1</rate><text>I was incredibly happy with the service that I had received at this location when moving into it at the start of the pandemic last year. However, over the last six months I have hardly ever been able to get into my storage unit being that it was directly across from where their construction crews decided to set up shop. It is interesting that one of the other commenters on here had stated that they told him the hours cut was due to recent break-ins.
That was not what I was told. I was told that it had to do with construction and that most likely it would be done sometime soon but he could also go on until the end of the year, they just didn’t really know.
I have a large unit at this location as well as a smaller unit at this location but they are both on the same run. I cannot tell you how many times I have pulled in only to see construction apparatus or vehicles completely blocking both of my units.
Before the hours reduction I was already having a hard time being able to get there after work and sometimes getting out of there late because I literally raced straight from work across town.
I was contacted by the district manager and immediately called her back to let her know I was very sorry for the times that I left late and understood her safety concerns. She in fact told me that she was surprised I called back and really appreciated my understanding and sincere apologies.
HOWEVER, She has been left multiple voicemails by myself as well as another individual and she has yet, after three months, to respond to any of them.

When I spoke to my husband he informed me that during his last phone call with the desk clerk, he had expressed that this was totally unacceptable for the hundreds of dollars that we’ve been paying for over a year.

Her response?
Unfortunately there’s nothing that can be done in the name of customer service and that all tenants will have to keep paying full price even though access and service have all been slashed by more than half.

I have spoken with two of my neighboring tenants and the overall vibe is that everybody is really feeling slighted by this company. All the way from the higher ups plain ignoring phone calls down to the property manager acting like they have absolutely no clue when any of this “construction” is slated to end.

And on a sidenote, Google maps is showing that from an aerial viewpoint all of the drive isles have been widened and all of the outer units have been installed to the point where it is visible without unsafe debris or work vehicles (For the longest time everything from an aerial point of view showed an absolute wreck).

My question is this.......
when did it become acceptable to treat current, loyal renters like yesterday’s news all in the name of the almighty dollar and the expectation of new renters who will take our units now that the company can force them to pay more?

I work in customer service for a living and it is really disheartening to see that this kind of easy come, easy go attitude is pervading not just the huge corporations but the smaller, more amiable and accessible business as well.

I guess I will have to start searching for a new location and company at a greater distance but I am more than willing to pay the extra dollars in gas, even suffer the inconvenience in distance, to get service that I can trust.
Especially during a time when so much is up in the air for our community and country.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

If you are looking for a place for storage - this is the place!  The customer service is EXCELLENT!  Shawn, JD and Kelly were helpful, friendly and accommodating with everything that I needed.  Every time, in the past few months, that I have had to update or transfer units these 3 have made it less stressful and were quick to help explain everything so that it was as easy as possible for me.  Many thanks to Shawn, JD and Kelly - you deserve way more than just this review - you guys are AWESOME!  Thank you!</text>

Shawn and Kris were absolutely fantastic! We are moving but need to keep our stuff in storage for a few months until our new place is ready. The process was super easy and we got exactly the perfect size unit for all our belongings. I wish every process was this easy and hassle free! Thanks guys for all your help!< /Review>

He was incredibly  courteous and laid out all the safety and security measures offered. Shawn put any doubts I had at ease and helped make the move easy.

DMV, etc...But, walking into Public Storage and being greeted by Jonathan was a warm and welcoming experience which I so needed at that moment.  That is why I keep coming back to PS for my storage needs.

Jonathan and Kyle (who quickly drove out from another location to help with a sudden rush of customers) are such kind, efficient and knowledgeable staff. They each worked very fast and were extremely understanding when I suddenly realized on moving day that my all of stuff would bit fit into the size I had rented. They quickly found me a bigger unit and got me processed quickly knowing that my movers were waiting with the truck of stuff and that I was paying them per hour. I highly recommend this location and especially these two staff members.< /Text>

My unit was broken into and pretty much cleaned out during working hours when they had employees on the property. The skylight near my unit was closed up so my area was very dark. There is no security here and the employees are useless and clueless. This is the facility where a fire broke out and I was told people were living in the units. Stay away!< /Review></record>

<Review>As I walked into this place, I got that yucky storage feeling. I was submerged with memories of my childhood and folks moving their lives and cramming them into a box. Then there were these two unique gentleman with amazing hair follicles! They were sweet with a nice dyanmic and they made me laugh. I would recommend coming here just for the experience.<//Review>< gmapID>

Wow, talk about excellent customer service! After waiting patiently for a customer to complete her transaction, Jonathan was incredibly amicable and patient. He didnt hesitate to stay a few minutes past closing time to allow me to get the storage I needed. This location is great and so peaceful.

I got a ton of help from Kat. I went to notify the office that I would be vacating and Kat offered to show me multiple spaces that really work with my budget. After Kat helped me realize the great deals and everything I couldn’t help but agree that this service is the best storage in town and their staff like Kat are incredibly helpful! Unfortunately I still have to move out but it very pleasant to do business with her! Highly recommended!</Review>

My visit at Public Storage Laguna Hills was outstanding.  Not only did Jason and Lauren know there business inside and out, they were also very accommodating to me as I left my lock and wallet at home.  They allowed me to borrow one for the evening and even brought it out to me so I didn't have to walk back.  Thank you very much Jason and Lauren for your service and ability to accommodate the customer!< /text>

Moving can be stressful and storing your personal belongings can be such a headache. I moved from out of state and had such a great experience with this storage.

I was very pleased with the customer service Rashmi and Ronnie provided. They were very caring throughout the process, and even showed me the unit twice. The individual attention was second to none!

Would definitely go back when I do need another storage locker.
Thank you so much for all you do.</text>

As a returning customer I am impressed with the social distancing implementations that the office has done has assured me the company cares about their customers.   I appreciate the friendly service given to me no matter who is working.   Renting here off the 5,  just makes good cents!!!</Review>

Miguel so rudely told me that they are not plumbers ! I’m sorry that want the question.  The only thing that this storage facility has going for it is location (freeway close) The only thing! Price too hi staff sucks customer service sucks,fire damage?

We were searching for a good and save storage and we really got it.  Abdullah was our contact in the office and he was so gently and helpful to me, and actually he is a very good asset to any business. Certainly, I am sure I did a very good decision.</review>

Lizanne and the entire team here is truly fantastic and beyond helpful!!!  During the most difficult time, they did nothing but help me and they offered free labor, boxes and haul away service.  Thank you, Public Storage Costeau, for making the best out of a not-so-good situation!!!! :) :)< /Review>

5 months after I gave this location a 5 Star Review, my car was hit by a Uhaul while in a parking spot. The staff told me it was my fault becasue they were partially closed due to a fire. There was not signage or notice to the renters regarding the fire or alternative parking directions given. I was so disappointed in the management of the whole incident. Can no longer recommend this location.<//Review>< pictures>

The are best of doing a great job, they went far and beyond attending my concerns. I really appreciate the great job and the best understanding they have.

Rent goes up MUCH faster than inflation. Over 8 years, it increased close to 70%. Not climate controlled, so expect stuff to be heat damaged in the summer.
Updating, as it appears that they're offering some sort of incentive for a high rating (all of the positive reviews are new).  This is the location that burned down, causing my parents to lose 50 years worth of xmas memories.
To add to this: I received a call from someone representing Public Storage asking me why I had done a review when I hadn't been a customer for a while (a few months, at least). When I tried to explain myself, she was rude and spoke over me.  I hung up on her and that was that.  Not the way to win back customers.< /Text>

<Text>Four alarm fire at the facility two days ago. I have been through voice mail hell, cut off many times after being on hold forever.
When I reached a human being I was either transfered and cut off again or promised a call back.
Very poor response, non actually to clients. I have no idea if I've lost everything or not. Company obviously touts its security, yet after fire has no clue how to handle customers, the web site is actually down although wasnt yesterday. The district manager, Liz Anne will not return calls, very frustrating and poor customer relations.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I had a really great time Renting at public storage in Laguna Hills, everything was really great, I made sure that my experience was amazing with Bushra and Ronnie, I was glad that I got a good rate for my monthly amounts, they even make sure to call me whenever I accidentally "unknowingly" paid late on my rent , and more importantly, it was a pretty quick sign-up process. The people/staff are very friendly, and I never had any problems with anything .<//text>

<review>Horrible place to rent at!! They will increase you rent without any notice. The prices are outrageous for how old the place is. And EVERY single time I go into the office and ask to speak to the property manager the staff tells me that the manager is on break in her apartment upstairs!!??? I've been in the office 6 times and those 6 times the manager is out on the premises,in her apartment, or the office is closed. DO NOT RENT HERE. My wife and I will be out by next month!!!!</review>< Pictures>

<text>Bushra & Abdullah were amazing from the time I walked in. They have awesome costumer service skills and are extremely polite and helpful. I got the biggest storage unit and a parking space. Both are better then what I imagined and are working out just perfectly. I would highly recommend this place to EVERYONE!

Thanks,

Melissa is awesome to work with ---- too bad there aren't more ladies like her.  She made my experience a happy one instead of the stress that are usually associated with storing one's stuff.

Thank you for having her at this location.</text>

<review>100% SATISFIED! OVER AND BEYOND CUSTOMER SERVICE , EXCELLENT SECURITY,  WILL ALWAYS USE AND RECOMMEND THIS COMPANY BECAUSE OF BUJHRA & ABDULLAH!

I had lost my job and had to move out of our apt. home. So my entire "life of belongings" is in this storage unit. The last 3 months I have had nothing but bad luck and things happening. So when I got a call that there was an issue with my unit, I just assumed the worst. It was Bujhra & Abdullah that had called to tell me the last time I used my storage unit , they had found that  the unit door was left open and I had only locked my "lock" to my door. So my entire unit was exposed, left open for anyone to steal, but thanks to Bujhra & Abdullah my unit was saved due to their excellent care, and immediate communication and quick thinking. They had pulled an outside roll down, so that my unit was not fully exposed, and then called to inform me. I instantly came down to the store, they showed my to my unit and what they had done to protect my belongings. I was so impressed and so very grateful that they walked their property and knew what was going on, and that they cared enough to go OVER and BEYOND what is required to do. I wish to thank Bujhra and Abdullah for their professionalism and personally caring about their customer! I will refer everyone to use Public Storage because of them!< /review><response>None<//response></record>

The worst haircut ever received, was wary about going back to a cheaper place after having a horrible haircut at supercuts in scotts valley. Needed a haircut, was about a week before my wedding. Told her that multiple times it was the most important haircut because if the wedding. Gave me the worst haircut I've ever had... Was much shorter on one side of the back, almost mullet like and uneven. Luckily someone I know fixed it and then I realized the extent of how bad it was... Would honestly like money back

{'time': 1617986329238, 'text': 'Dear Gabriel!\nI am very sorry reading your comment. Yet, I don’t quite remember if I ever gave a bad haircut for a customer for a wedding event the last couple weeks. If you were really my customer that I gave a bad, mullet haircut, I am extremely sorry and I will return the money back to you. Please call me. Again, if this was what really happened, I’m very sorry and would love to talk to you, and return the money back.\n- Amy'}< /resp>

My son was nervous about letting his hair get cut short (he likes it a bit shaggy) but after having Amy cut his hair a couple times, he trusted her to go shorter & it looks great!!< /Text>

Friendly, professional and talented. Couldn't be happier having Amy cut my hair. I'm fairly picky and she did exactly what I wanted.

10/10 perfect.< /text>

Fast and well priced... I paid $40 down the street... For a short old man's haircut... Too much. Amy is fast and friendly.... Updated to 5 Stars. Perfect haircuts multiple times. Amy is very professional and accommodating.< /text>

Great kid haircuts, great husband haircut. I'm going next. Best part, she cuts my son's hair in less than 20 minutes and runs on schedule. Thank you Amy!< /text>

<text>First and foremost. I would like to thank Amy for doing such a phenomenal job giving me a haircut.
I have never been to a shop that took such good care of my hair as she did. Im a very particular person when it comes to my hair so at first, I was very skeptical to come here as it was my first time. But no oh no I did not regret it because of the fact that she gave me one of the best haircuts of my life. She took her time and more importantly, she got my hair to how I exactly wanted it to be. Nice, clean, and proportionate. I will be glad to say that she has found another regular or should I say a loyal customer for the years to come. A well deserved review as im not usually the one to write reviews except for bad experiences. This definitely earned a review for me. Once again, thank you Amy. And I will be back sooner than expected.<//text>< pictures>

This place is the worst, she cancel my appointment, and just leave,Go to this place only if you don't value your time. As a result I had to leave without service (wasted my time) because I had other things scheduled later on that day.</Text>

Sweetness: 75% Ice: light
- creamy
- love the oolong tea (not too overwhelming but just perfect and smooth)
- boba was SO PERFECT N CHEWY N SWEET
- you know how cold brew coffee is smooth? That's how smooth this drink was!

Matcha Royale 10/10
Sweetness: 75% Ice: light
- matcha is NOT sandy!! Wow first place that didn't lie about their "premium" matcha
- again, I love their boba!

Overall, great service! The cashier was super nice and explained how the boba is a bit on the sweeter so I was able to adjust the level of sweetness accordingly. The barista was also really nice. The store was super cute on the inside! Overall, glad I finally tried this place. Definitely worth the drive!<//Text><name>Rachel Fina<//name><userid>106345726933003985618< /userid><Response>None< /Response>< Time>

I am a regular and always enjoy the quality of the drinks here.  The whole family comes here weekly.
Just today I m very upset to report that the drink was not sealed and as a result spilled all over my car. I wish there is better quality control on it.< /review>

Wide variety of drinks. They also have new drinks all the time. The drink in the photo is a Thai tea. Keep in mind that they only have one size. It's not really a problem for me though.<//Text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><text>Ordered online - House Milk Tea & Grapefruit Garden for pickup. We were a bit early but we let them know and they made our drinks within 5-7 minutes. They had a table set up in front so you can order from there during COVID. There were also 6 ft marked on the ground outside to keep social distant.

Roasted Tea Creama ($6) was good and boba was decent as well. It was already mixed when we got it.

Grapefruit Garden ($6) was not what I expected. It's not the sour tart I was expecting. I won't be ordering this again but open to trying other drinks.< /text>< date>

< Review>
Always great service. Shout out to Chloe for being amazing !
Such great boba. I love the variety of choices. Only place I can get popping lychee in the area.
I recommend the mango funtime and the taro milk tea (without the taro chunks).
My friend really enjoys their house milk tea and the mango funtime as well!
Little pricy though!< /Review>

We weren’t impressed. I got a regular brewed tea with boba = $6.2 per cup. The tea tasted like water and the boba was too warm/ soft. The service was slow and employee wasn’t in a good mood to smile. I don’t think I’ll be back.<//Review>

I ordered Taro milk tea with red beans few minutes ago. There weren’t much red beans on the drink and it should be in lieu of the tarp chunks. Ahhh!</Text>

This is my go to spot for bubble tea. The best part really is their hours, being able to get my tea fix until 11pm at night is pretty important to me lol.

The Boba is usually good, though they often run out. I've maybe only ever had 1 or 2 drinks where the Boba itself was off. The teas are good, but some aren't as good without the Boba, so if they've run out of Boba, select a drink that works without it.

They're very accommodating to diets as well and will customize the drink to your needs.

The limited edition drinks are typically very good. Their fruit drinks are great as well (very fresh).< /review>

<text>Honestly, I can't express enough graciousness that I have for the Weingart. I don't know what I would do without the help Im getting from the staff, the administrators the security team my case managers and their supervisors. Maintenance as well.Also I want to do something to show how grateful I am but they make sure that I know that they don't expect anything in return. Im sure every single person that God blesses to come here can say the same thing. Maybe better than I can say it. Thank you Weingart clients as well for being patient with me. I have been wrong in the past and you didnt take my life. Much Love. P.E.A.C.E.< /text>< pics>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>This place is full of racist Mexicans who don't help African Americans. And the staff who is African American are passive scared to lose their job so they don't speak up. But none of the really care none of they do the job they signed up for. The security steals and are racist against anyone not Mexican. The rooms are nasty my bed showed signs of bedbug infestation walls covered in stuff. They DON'T want normal people trying to make a better life they prefer drug addicts. I needed help after losing my job they treat you like you are stupid. This place is only open and in it for the money. They make you put your valuable bike outside where criminals that work for them can steal your bike. THEY NEED TO RESTAFF AND RESTART WITH PEOPLE WHO WANT TO REALLY HELP.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Too many diseased people. Drugs being sold in and around the building. Individuals throw urine and fecal matter from their windows on to the sidewalk. The staff in the building treat you like a criminal. Their elevators break-down at least once a month. They use Soy and Tofu as meat replacements in their cafeteria. Drugs being sold directly in front of the cafeteria. Drug addicts and alcoholics loiter and panhandle in front of the building.<//Review></record>

FILTHY, horrifically LOUD, Much of the staff are impatient, arrogant, untrained, I’ll tempered and disrespectful. It’s Dark, Dreary, LOUD, HARD, Angry and dismal. Catering to the most desperate/disparate in our society it’s last stop & should be. In their bid to serve ‘ALL’ they miss the mark Grandly. When the VA stopped paying my way (OUR WAY) they kicked me (US) out unceremoniously.
Shameful.</Text>

This is a homeless shelter with a focus on drug rehabilitation, job training on site, and a whole floor for people with serious illnesses staffed by medical personnel.  This is probably the best shelter in the downtown area.  They even have single rooms with doors that can be locked by their occupants for those who are complying with the program requirements.  They also have on site counseling.<//review>

<text>The most wonderful kind and caring staff, However my first year working there I wondered why the retention rate of employees was so low. The  building is a night mare  And the administrative staff pretends that they don't realize the need.. The  new CFO  IS SO insecure that she  Retaliated  when I complained . but that's her reputation  . The clients are out of control, But its due to the fact that there's only one Clinical Social Worker that is willing to work under extreme  conditions  Anything goes as long as the center gets paid foe the beds that are rented   by the Dept. of Mental Health. Probation and Parole.  possible acts of violence, are frequent . my first year a man jumped out the window and killed himself  .Staff  and clients were attacked the elevators are a danger they break thee time a week or more. the living area is dirty  and broken up,   complain about the conditions you're sure to get terminated</text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c636cedf7989:0xcfe314b5a9df9535< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>My co-worker Monique B went to Weingart Center to have a TB SKIN Test and the latino person who administered the test must have used a dirty needle and did not even clean the skin area.   My friend has a round black circle and swelling for months.   Please be careful because there are idiots everywhere who do not know how to do their job.

The weingart has staff that are THIEVES. My husband stayed there, and they kicked him out for being one our late when I was in the hospital getting tests run because I am a cancer survivor and I've had symptoms of the cancer returning. I am STILL having a bunch of tests done, and my husband and I are disabled, and my husband was calling his counselor at the weingart every hour on the hour, to let them know what was going on. They decided to kick him out when he arrived ONE hour late - they packed all his belongings, EXCEPT WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO KEEP. They stole two gibson  (worth more than $5000) and DVD player from him. A week later, we ran into a friend, P****, at the hospital, who was so upset, because he was having heart problems, and the weingart did the same thing - they kicked him out, packed his stuff and kept two of his flat screen televisions, over 100 brand new DVD's and a DVD player. Our friend E**** also had MONEY stolen from his wallet, right after he had just cashed his social security check! As well as our friend W***, who also had money stolen from him. The STAFF needs to be held accountable for what they are doing! T?hey are supposed to be HELPING people - and instead, they are STEALING from people. They are taking things from people who are down and out, hurting, struggling with addiction and the mentally ill. They are taking advantage of people who are weak and afraid - afraid of losing their housing if they stand up and say or do anything when they have things stolen from them, and the weingart staff know this.
My husband and I have been clean and sober for 15 months now, and we are disabled and still struggling with numerous health issues. We took the weingart to court, and sued them for what they stole from my husband. The representative for the weingart, E* and my husband's counselor (WHO SAW MY HUSBAND'S BELONGINGS, AND LIED IN COURT), J****, they offered us $200, then $300, then $500 - to try to get us to settle outside of court - and we said NO, we want them held accountable. It's really not even about money - we want to EXPOSE THEM, so they stop taking advantage of homeless, down and out people.
Right before court, E* offered us  $700, saying that even if we won, that they would appeal, and wear us down, keep us in court for a few YEARS. They KNOW we're disabled - they kept asking for continuances, over and over, probably thinking we wouldn't be able to keep up with the court dates - my husband and I are both in EXTREME PAIN, and use walkers to get around. We still refused to settle.
Finally, right before the last court day, E* offered $1000 as 'the last offer" - he should a copy of some paper that SUPPOSEDLY my husband signed, without the belongings they stole from him on the list. I was too sick to go to court with my husband the last time, but HE WON - PRAISE GOD - the judge must have sen they were lying, or that they've stolen from other people also.
The LAST DAY the weingart could appeal, we received a letter saying they HAVE APPEALED, and we have another court date, July 2nd. IF ANYONE HAS STAYED THERE - we want to expose them, and I may even contact the media about thus. They are SO WRONG for doing what they're doing. My husband had to go to the hospital the day after he received the appeal, for chest pains, and they admitted him, because he had a blood clot. He had also been hospitalized a day before then as well. The stress regarding the court trips are very, very, tiring. But we WILL PERSEVERE!!! :-P

2019 - WE still WON $2000 AFTER they appealed!!!</review>< gmap_id>

<text>Not only is the neighborhood completely vile, i couldn't get into the program without any identification. The hotel vouchers department of social services issues only provide for half a month's stay. On the bright side the place costs 14 dollars a day and has a tv room with a microwave. Laundry is free. The bathroom stinks really bad and the shower is shared, but the water is hot. The other bad part is that you need a money order to get in there and need some sort of id to get your key every time you go outside. And the final good part is that there is a guard screening everyone with a metal detector wand and checking bags for contraband. But the neighborhood is awful.<//text>< pictures>

As I try to escape. From a DV situation. I find that the poor and homeless are treated like abhorred toddlers without human dignity.  I have seen so much horror I want to make all aware that people need hope and love not what passes for charity but ends up keeping the rabble downtown and out of site.</Review>

This place is horrible. It's true what people say about receiving services there, however as an employee I have to say it's not the employees fault for things going wrong, it's the managers of the departments , case managers, the corporate office, and the CEO's fault for not communicating properly with the employees and contradicting themselves. As a former employee working there I can assure you this is what usually happens not to mention the drama between employees and staff complaining about their job nonstop. If you are looking for a job, please do not apply here, there is so much discrimination among staff and miscommunication is rampant. My former manager Tamara Edmonds covered for employees every time I would tell her that staff was being unprofessional and did nothing to solve the problems and instead pitted staff against each other. I quit this job due to the fact that both clients and staff don't get the recognition for working hard with the population. They would tell us to don't turn away clients but only to get money out of each and every one who arrives there since the Vice President Monica Guthrie Davis only cares about numbers and sees the homeless population as numbers. There is also drama among employees< /Review>

I was over here needing help in a bad way.  I sat in their waiting area and fell asleep at some point.  when I woke up I checked with security at the door and he scratched my name off his list.  I ended up going somewhere else and got my problem sorted out.  I was waiting out front before they opened up in the morning and there was all kinds of window dopers etc.  when the front door opened up there must have been a fight going on.  there was this half naked dude who looked really messed up getting thrown out.  there are a lot of bums hang around there too.</Review>

It's OK for the price unless you are in a program which is free, admittedly the bathrooms are messy due to the people who are mental. Housing for homeless. You share a room also if renting.</Text>

It's an odd little bar located near great food stops. The decor is based off of a fun house, but it's not too over the top. I got a strawberry margarita. It was so delicious and the strawberry was fresh! I loved the bar seating. The barstools are on springs/coils to further emphasize the "fun house" theme. Come here for a pre-dinner drink for a fun conversation starter.< /text>

<Review>Incredible food. Wow, the apple pie, brie burger is mindblowing. The fried chicken sandwich was really good too. Ambience, music and service quality incredible too. They constantly keep feeling your water and they are very knowledgeable and detailed when describing the food. Great experience and I would come back. It is somewhat pricey though.< /Review><username>Andreas “Aris” Aristidou<//username><Date>1571715785142< /Date><gmap_id>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5<//gmap_id><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNncmEDsX8RRkBG6k51V4TN8F4MKxu1qJzItt8s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5kiRK4zOeiS_-S7yWe92Z6991U_HuMNENE599=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOrKan_ZY-8Hyk3JtGfhytzv9ECGodhk0N0wdY1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDvtOMWe6TIWKco22KV-gkWaGvmGJGhm-YVk5-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMB07Xt_hO-aBx0wSCe0YL_E9QtIE2LGGJQumm1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOAf7dcCMrd6nsqCyoU8OZ1Mu9jjr6vlBynk1Rg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUEZ0tiKHgLWHTBHIoIDNZreqeu5hfXKvbfUpB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMgr2MXrv9U-fFV5ZfsPRxwaKugnW-BD_nld-Lw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMN08An4ODZDdGow-JPw3P8_GQ5pOJapU4RSQGG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVbPt6TO6rmcqOZ55kuUPYQ1rBRotLjb8yWkLv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuwdmln0fT0AFxLNi-UX10gbzic8X9FKnQ3H-M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics></record></dataset><record>

Super chill atmosphere. Lots of space to sit or even lounge in couches. I can't speak on behalf of the food, but the drinks are absolutely incredible! They definitely have their own version of cocktails that I've never had before.

I was originally going to give four stars but on the last drink the bartender actually came over to our table and lit it on fire and did an entire show, it was so awesome! It was called the forbidden. He said he doesn't always do it tableside, so don't expect it, but when he has time he does.

We would recommend this. We will be back for happy hour.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>Darkly wood panelled place, dine in the pseudo "old" style. Overstuffed stools, a couch or two and a secondary bar level stooped area make for abundant seating. Service was uneven, as it took the staff over 10 minutes to notice that we were there (not many of them were out) but once we were noticed, a number of servers and associated workers appeared, as if they were all occupied elsewhere and just got let out; it was odd. The service, once the servers were "out", was prompt and professional. Drinks are not cheap but I had the feeling they are trying to represent themselves as an "established" place but the feel was more if an "upscaley" place; we're popular and you're fortunate to be eating our fine food. The food was quite good. The drinks were quite tasty (they know what they're doing) but I wouldn't go there for drinks (too little for what is charged) unless I pulled in 100k yearly, imho.  4.5 STARS< /Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB0USBDrh8qsuGTYdcEoh969SImhVdOfyQgOnT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf_RJGaTHux0clGRc4RvQmcEIN_Z9WcIokRbk3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMzINCk8g1lpOP2veQydXqdaJ7OVSAYnVdNerw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

White Horse is a really great place to visit for delicious New Orleans Cajun. The food and drinks are very well priced for the outstanding quality you get, and the servers and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable as well. Feel safe when visiting, everything is being done with the COVID best practice requirements. Great happy hour offerings as well, especially for those that like 'Old Fashioneds'. I really liked and appreciated the old school music and old fashioned dim bar surroundings, it really was refreshing. The dark wood and red upholstery The exterior design is very tasteful and catches your attention when passing by. The set up works great for those looking for a group setting or even just for couples. I found the brunch menu to be especially enticing, I'm going to need to come back a couple of times to try out all the things that looked promising. The parking structure is right next door for maximum convenience. This place is truly a hidden gem amongst all the other great places in Pasadena. I'm also looking forward to checking out their sister location, Craft Hill, which I've heard great things about. Brandon was an amazing team member and recommended the fried chicken sandwich, which was fantastic. He knew all the items on the menu almost from memory and went above and beyond to walk me through everything. I'm glad I went with his recommendations. He also told me some cool things to do in the area and South Pasadena, so I have those on my list as well. They don't skip on the portions either, you'll definitely satisfy your appetite and probably have some leftovers as well. I can't think of much they can do to improve things, everything was so great! I plan on visiting again sooner rather than later.</Text>

Yan is incredible! The White Horse is making the most of COVID by offering their amazing cocktails on draft and individually canned to go. Everyone should be going to supplement their home drinking experience! 10/10 try the Strawberry Buck!< /text>

< Review>
The White Horse Lounge is a very nice upscale place. They have a fairly decent happy hour, and the staff is always more than accommodating. Fancy cocktails with flowers in them, and some good appetizers in the bar area. They have a restaurant portion as well, but I've honestly never made it that far.<//Review>

The food is really amazing and they never have the same menu for a very long time so if you haven't been there in a while you probably missed a few dishes they make some of the amazing southern style dishes like for example fried green tomato you can never find that anywhere else I never see that in any menu in any restaurant at all The atmosphere is very relaxing and amazing a very romantic place. A perfect place for a date<//review>

< Review>
If I weren't a vegetarian, is give it 5 stars - not a huge menu for us vegetarians, but you gotta know that going in. A really cool vibe, intimate rooms to dine without the bar noise, and a Cajun menu that definitely reminds me of my time in New Orleans. The drinks were really good, too. I had a couple of Strawberry Bucks that were delicious. I wish I'd had more room for dessert.</Review>

<time>1573446362986</time><text>Would've been 5-star except for bottomless mimosas said they were served until 3pm, but they do last call at 2:30pm. WTH? They need to change the time on the menu. We had the fried chicken and Avocado Bruchetta - excellent and would definitely return for both. Home.ade biscuits come with chicken and they are delicious! I ordered a single mimosa - tasty, except served in a margarita glass...yes, I like proper stemware. Waiter was attentive and food was great! Would go earlier for brunch and be early for mimosa's!<//text>< Response>

Good place for brunch if you enjoy creole food. I recommend the Shrimp n' Grits or the Breakfast Skillet. Good size portions on the food. They also have delicious craft cocktails and bottomless mimosas.
If you have a large party I recommend making a reservation.</Text>

Good food. Bottomless mimosas for brunch. Would have been five stars, but service wasn't so great. We were a large party, maybe that has something to do with it. I ordered the omelette, delicious. The bloody Mary was pretty good too, but small for the price.</Review>

Pretty pricey on the drinks. Only had fries (amazing), but saw the food on other tables and it all looked very delicious. Music was very diverse, and that's appreciated. Bartenders were friendly, but super slow, I waited at least 20 minutes for drinks on a Thursday night. Seems cool for a date, I was in a group setting. Didnt seem crowded but everywhere I stood I felt "in the way". Not my vibe but I also didn't hate it.< /text>

Only here to pre-game for the Rose bowl. Fantastic spot. Great bartenders. Great service. Small up for front bar.

Will come back next time in Pasadena to try the menu.<//Review>< pics>

The Last Minute was delicious. This is a very unique and complex drink, subtle notes of chocolate, ancho chile and a smokey scent.  A must try!<//review>

Cozy place with an old timey bar feel. We sat in the bar and had good service and some tasty drinks. My hubby and I were out on a date and the music (though good) was very loud and it was hard to hear each other even though we were sitting next to one another - we left after one drink. Probably a fun place if you like super loud music.<//Review>

Music was very diverse, and that's appreciated. Bartenders were friendly, but super slow, I waited at least 20 minutes for drinks on a Thursday night. Seems cool for a date, I was in a group setting. Didnt seem crowded but everywhere I stood I felt "in the way". Not my vibe but I also didn't hate it.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Good drinks, friendly staff, not totally rip-off prices - which for this location, is pretty d@mned impressive!

One suggestion, they have a "Bartender's choice" drink - ask what it is, but it's probably one of your best bets. Enjoy!<//text>

<text>What a wonderful surprise!! The White Horse Lounge is a great place for family, out of town guest spot, romantic two or just friends! The food is an explosion of flavors and mouth watering treats! I kind you not.The Southern fried chicken is seasoned to delight, the Hoe cake was the best the salmon avec haricot verts satisfies the palate with lightness, and the drinks well let's just say they don't hold back! This place was absolutely perfect and a great customer service.</text>< Pictures>

I like to cook. I do. I really really do. So I already know when I go out to eat that I can prepare the meal I’m going to eat just as well as the restaurant for a fraction of the price. Therefore service, ambiance, and cleanliness are of the upmost importance to me.

Before I start with the bad I should really say that the food was outstanding. Very flavorful and well presented. The ambiance was relaxed making the White Horse seem like a popular place among the young and old alike. Cleanliness in the bar and restrooms was above average.

My only complaint was the attentiveness and speed of the staff.  Our drink orders took forever. Our food (two dishes) was delivered about fifteen minutes apart and it seems they really didn’t want to bring us the check.

Overall it was a good experience. However, with dozens and dozens of restaurants to choose from, owners/managers must strive for perfection in all aspects of their restaurant and not just the food. When it comes down to it, almost anyone can make a tuna sandwich and mix a drink.</Review>

A packed dining room and bar put this place quite in the limelight as you enter on a weekend evening. Unfortunately, there were far too many misses to honestly click on an extra star for the rating.

The bar seriously needs to pay attention to customers. Waiting for my party and waiting at the bar, and trying to get a drink was an impossible 5 minutes. They were treating me like I just came out of an AA meeting.

The menu seems to hit most of the notes for a hungry patron. At first glance, you can see it is well designed. Something for everyone wraps the context of each category. Fine Wagyu meats, a great burger, your standard salmon dish, and an attractive Southern Fried Chicken.

Dig deeper and you can find the pretentiousness of certain items. The use of Wagyu in smoked brisket, for example, is quite a redundancy. Why pay for a Wagyu priced cut that is supposed to be slow-smoked/cooked?

The Jumbalaya Rissoto is in fact not "risotto," and made with orzo pasta. Granted it is stated in the description as orzo, the title is completely misleading. If a person was gluten intolerant this would be a horrific experience. This dish is totally not worthy of the $26 price tag for a pasta dish.

The service felt like the servers were really working hard. I overheard a waiter mumbling about covering 8 large tables. I commend the service timing for everyone at the table.

The drinks here are very good. The bar certainly displays some craft behind their creations. I would return for their happy hour, and possibly a revisit for a sample of other items.

I do miss Cheval Blanc that once took this location to new heights in french cuisine.<//text>

This place is nice and warm, wood paneling and a cozy upscale atmosphere. Well crafted drinks at a very nice bar. A menu that is NOLA inspired with great service.</review>

<Text>Too many things wrong with this place! The music did NOT match the restaurant!!! Our brussel sprouts were like beef jerky! The mac and cheese was salty, The fried green tomatoes were about the only descent item on the menu. I was asked only once if I wanted a refill (I was drinking Stella) when I said yes they were having problems with the keg. 2 other people we were with ordered mixed drinks and were asked only once. I would have ordered 3 or 4 beers if the server had been more on it. The only thing that made it a tad better was that we were there at happy hour! We will NOT be returning!!</Text><Name>Jennifer Adomeit< /Name><resp>None< /resp><date>1557549918007<//date>< pictures>

<text>I was here for a rehearsal dinner two weeks ago. We had tri-tip, chicken, mashed potatoes, and a salad. All of the food was excellent... the meat was so tender, and the potatoes has a pleasantly surprising kick!!

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I've only come here for the bar and drinks, never had the food. The drinks are all great, well thought out, and delicious. They switch up the cocktail menu every couple of months, so there's always something new to try as well. For Pasadena, the drinks are fairly priced and the bartenders are super knowledgeable.

It can get pretty packed and hard to flag down someone to order a drink sometimes. It''s a great place to have some drinks before going to a club or just have a chill night talking with some friends.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<Review>There are better places in Pasadena. Stopped by two nights in a row. First for dinner and the next for drinks. Both experiences left me fairly ready to move on to the next place. Beer options available on tap are decent. Food options are limited although they do provide variety (chicken, beef, seafood, pasta, salad, etc.).< /Review>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>This is an old-world style bar and restaurant with a very warmly decorated interior. Giant overstuffed leather couches line one whole side with warm overtones throughout. The bartenders are very well informed on different mixology styles and techniques and are very attentive even when the place is bustling. The food is really great as well, you've got your usual garlic fries and appetizers but their entrees are also excellent. I recommend the burger :)</Text><username>Lara Vargas</username><GmapID>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Amazing drinks. Have never been disappointed here. Tell the bartender what you like and watch them make you the best drink you ever had! Also I couldn't remember but there are TV's that you can watch from the bar area.</text>

<text>Great food with a wide variety of options. Not cheap, but not over-priced either and you can't beat the ambiance, location, or level of service. Nestled in the middle of downtown Pasadena, the location is prime as a jumping off point for a nice meal and a couple of drinks before a night out on the town.< /text>< Pics>

The bread pudding was really average. Go for the beignets instead.

<text>they must go through a rigorous process with the Bartenders, they can mix a hell of a drink. The Signature drinks are very tasty and well worth it.

The burger was cooked great, very little seasoning allowing you to take in the taste of the beef. You can select Garlic Fries with this which I must say for being a dish you see at a lot places, this really does stand out on it's own. Not overpowering with Parmesan which you find a lot of times.

The Shrimp and Grits was fantastic. Chunks of Chorizo and Hominy really brought out this dish . I really recommend this.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< user_name>

Just know that I love Roy's, and if you get the chance, you should eat there. They have made multiple changes to the menu (added lots of Sushi), and the new dishes are outstanding. Service is spot on and Keith (Managing Partner) makes sure that Roy's is run to the highest standard.< /Text>

I came here last night for my birthday. First I gotta say the food deserves 5 stars. The food was fresh and delicious. I'm knocking off 3 stars because of our interaction with the Manager Cameron. My wife reserved a room for my birthday party and out of nowhere the waitress let us know we had 10 minutes to clear the room (decorations, etc.) because another party was going to sit there. They  didn't even have another table to transition us to. The waitress was pretty much like, "I guess you can sit at one of the other tables." Odd thing is, once we moved to the outside area we never saw anyone move into where we sitting. So why have us move out? My wife complained to the Manager Cameron about this and he preceded to argue back with my wife for about 30 minutes. He explained to my wife that the party that was going to move into our section decided to stay at the bar area afterall. We will  never be back to this restaurant again, which is a shame because like I said, the food was delicious. The way Cameron handled this situation was poor. Somebody needs to train this guy on how to provide good customer service. There is no excuse for him to try to win an argument with a paying customer (we spent over $900). With his actions he pretty much said, "we got these guys $900. Get 'em out so we can collect on this new group."</Text>

<review>Some of the worst food I've ever tasted.  It was shocking.  The drinks actually were good, as was the service. The Buffalo Brass, the wings, and the hoecake were all bland.  The apple pie burger was... fine... I mean... Why?  For what purpose?  But it was edible.  The beignets and the bread pudding was not.  At least everything was expensive!

Brett was the best, most helpful bartender I've ever had. He listened and was able to recommend the most amazing Rye and Bourbons as well as making our anniversary so special. The food is decadent, and from the heart of Louisiana. I will most definitely be coming back and bringing my friends.<//text>

<resp>None<//resp><review>Good food and drinks. Cool atmosphere and nice wait staff. A bit pricey but not too bad for Pasadena area and what they offer. My only issue is the music. Wayyyy too loud and doesn't fit the venue. Please play some Louisiana jazz or 40s crooner type music and for pete's sake, lower the volume so I can hear what my friends are saying!!</review>< Rating>

Happy hour has some good deals. The burger was very good and the bacon was the thickest sliced pieces I've ever seen, it was awesome. The decor seems very nice, but when I visited, the place had a very casual vibe, but then again, most of the patrons were on their way to a Metallica concert, so I'm not sure if that crowd is typical, but it was a good experience. There's a parking garage right next door with first 90 minutes free.< /review>

Ambiance, drinks and customer service are all top notch. This is my fav watering hole in old Pas. Haven't eaten here yet, but the menu looks yummy. If you're looking for a cool speakeasy vibe with awesome tasty artisan cocktails, this is the spot.</text>

<Review>The white horse is a throw back to the early days when bars that have quaint feel to them. They have a lot of setting. The white horse gets a noise level that is deafening in the evening, so don't have any deep conversation. The drinks are amazing. I had a Manhattan and I would have to say it was the bomb.< /Review>< Response>

We visit every year and have never been disappointed with the food and service at Parkway Grill. ALL their entrees are served well and tasty. We as a party of four had salmon or steaks and super. Do not miss it.< /Review>

<rate>3</rate><review>So craft drinks are nice and all... I appreciate the effort and time it takes. BUT... The problem with places like this is that when it gets busy these drinks take entirely way too long. An simple request for a beer turns into a 20mins wait while fruit is massaged, sage is burned, ice is sweated... Props to the idea but practicality wins in places that last more than a year<//review>< pictures>

< review>
What a wonderful surprise!! The White Horse Lounge is a great place for family, out of town guest spot, romantic two or just friends! The food is an explosion of flavors and mouth watering treats! I kind you not.. the southern fried chicken is seasoned to delight, the Hoe cake made me moooan, the salmon avec haricot verts satisfies the palate with lightness.. and the drinks..well let's just say they don't hold back! The ambiance is Nu Oleans almost classic brothel style with elegant private cubbies tucked aside; it's warm and welcoming and smooth music playing in the background will catch you for a recognizable song.. the service is exceptional, making sure you're delighted to be there. The chef is to be applauded..my understanding is he's been there about a year and a half and he's for sure making a statement at the White Horse Lounge! Oh and did I mention the Blackberry peach cobbler!! The place is high on my list you won't be disappointed!!< /review>

Its Yelp score is for a reason. Best bar in Old Town. Dont be afraid to ask for certain tenders,  they all have specialized skills. #someguynamedbrett, Top 5 bartenders of all time in this experts opinion. Legit<//Review>

Worst place ever. No seating and you always need to  stand as it’s tiny place.  No one cares about you. I ordered fried chicken and beignets and it was so worst . Very bad preparation , taste and quality .. not sure how it got good reviews . I wouldn’t recommend<//text>

Bah hipsters love over priced drinks and food. I don't get it. Ambience is nice and compliments the old town feel but seriously go to the dirty diver around the corner for an authentic Pasadena experience.< /Text>

Classy speakeasy ambiance, with amazing crafted cocktails... Got the Killing Thyme (aperol and st. Germaine), which was yummy and involved torched herbs..fun!

Friendly bartenders and a good range of happy hour deals. The truffle parmesan fries are delicious!</text>

“Great Food no privacy”
Walking into Roys, I wasn't expecting much in the way of satisfaction to the palate. I visit Hawaii often and my overall impression has always been, that what the island lacks in sophistication as it relates to dining, is excused because of the location.<//text>

<Review>Service was outstanding! Appetizers were all good, but the truffle fries were worth cheating on your diet. The hush puppies were really very plain falafel. Skip those until the chef figured out whether to make true southern hush puppies or actual falafel. The margarita and The Smartass were perfectly sweet. We'd definitely go back.</Review>< username>

On an early Saturday morning we filled the place with our wedding party. Nice warm setting. Attentive servers. Food appropriate for 'tavern style'..ok and good portions. Drinks a bit pricy. (Ex. $10 for glass of house white wine) but if the mood is good maybe that's ok.<//review>

Cool space in old Pasadena with a unique menu and drinks (try RyePA). Some things are worn down (like the bathroom, some furniture and the server bill books) hopefully not a sign of owner's differed maintenance.<//Text>

Update:
We stopped by and has Arroyo hamburger which was fantastic. Big Josh, the chef stopped by and revealed that the every ingrediants used here is from a local and certified grower. We had Judy taken care of us.

Josh was proud of his cooking style learned from her Japanese granma.

A classy place with great selection and service. We just dropped in and got hooked.

We sat in and Cesar took our order. He suggested Strawberry Buck and Peach Schnapps to start with which were both sweet drinks and fit the occasion. Bertta, the manager stopped by and chatted with us over the specials for the night.

The Bread and Butter we got was warmly toasted with some  greens and slice of pork. We ordered Porklion and Arroyo Burger. Both were good and tasty. The portions were adequate.

We ended with Pear cobbler with scoop of ice cream. Well made and filling.< /Text>

ordered the pesto sandwhich with truffle fries  it was righy on the money the pesto was fresh the chicken tender  the chibatta softer than other chibbattas I've had the 5 cheese Mac  was deliscious. I came to white horse because i saw their Mac and cheese  went on a date she orderd the steak and potatoes plate they are amazing cooks. Her potatoes were so rich in buttery flavor and a creamy thickness that people strive for when they claim they have the best in town.I want to disagree with who ever  didn't  like the food i want to try mor items from the menu the Georgia  smash was mixed well.<//Review>

< Review>
We came to White Horse Lounge in Pasadena to celebrate a friend's birthday.
Love the beautiful bar area. It’s got that classic American bar vibe.
Since we have a large party, we were seated in the private room in the back.
Very simple one page menu. They have quite a few small bites that are great with drinks.

Market Hummus | $10
House Lavash, EVOO, Fresh Garnish
We ordered a few appetizers to share.
Market Hummus was just ok. It lacked flavor.

Seared Brussel Sprouts | $10
Smoked Tomatoes, Basil, Parmesan
Seared Brussel Sprouts was great. We enjoyed the addition of tomatoes and basil.

Garlic Truffle Fries | $9
Truffle Oil, Parmesan, Gremolata
We love the Garlic Truffle Fries. Thick and crunchy fries seasoned with truffle oil and cheese.

Bone-In New York 22 oz | $45
For steak orders, guests can pick 2 sides and a sauce for the meat.
A friend ordered the huge Bone-In New York, and she almost finished it!
She likes the steak, but didn’t like the cajun butter sauce.

Ribeye 16 oz | $35
Dr. P and I both ordered the Ribeye.
The steak was cooked perfectly. Very delicious.
For sides, I got the twice baked potato and corn succotash.
I enjoyed both. And the horseradish sauce was great with the steak.

The Black Sea | $25
Squid Ink Tagliolini, Dinapoli Tomato, Calamari, Prawn, Finés Herbes
A few people ordered The Black Sea – the squid ink seafood pasta.
Everyone said it was way too salty, and nobody liked it.

I like that we had the private room, and could be as loud as we want.
Service could be better. Our waitress didn’t check on us often.
We had to go out to find her a few times.
It was a really fun night with friends.</Review>

Great ambiance and good appetizers. Pretty disappointing on entrees.

Crispy Shrimp - delicious, small portion
Ahi Poke Tower - good; crunchy, sauce tastes like teriyaki instead of ponzu, small portion
Garlic Truffle Fries - good, decent portion

Besto Pesto - okay; too much sauce, falls apart easily
The Regal - bad; steak is tender, salty sauce, not worth the price
The Black Sea - okay, handmade pasta is too thin, sauce could be better, not worth the price

Beignet - delicious, warm donuts that go well with chocolate-hazelnut sauce
Chocolate mousse cake - okay, very heavy chocolate taste</text>

<Text>I was there few nights ago to try their new menu items. I tried two different types of kale salad, stuffed mushrooms, mashed potato, turmeric rice, buffalo brass, filet mignon, creme brulee and fried twinkie with ice cream. I'm pretty satisfied. The service was great, the food was good, my favorite was filet mignon and buffalo brass, which is fried cauliflower in buffalo sauce. When I saw it on the table, it looks just like chicken wings but it's cauliflower. Mashed potato wasn't my favorite, it didn't have much flavor but that means it's healthy. Everything was pretty healthy yet tasty.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Holy Moly!!! One of the best bars in the universe! Between bartender Brett's "Angry Squirter" drink - a spritzy, lemony orange, refreshing yet sensual concoction,....to bartender Brian's "Burnt Orange" drink - a Rye, charred orange, bitters, & in house made grenadine, the White House Lounge had something for everyone. The beautiful curly birch bar that was imported from 1908 old town Chicago is a must see! Other drinks to try are the Punch 41 & the Smartass. Not to mention the guiness reduction & cabernet reduction are amazing...good enough for pancake syrup!  :p. LOVE THESE GUYS. Can't wait to come back!

<userid>117396853499975180303<//userid><text>(Translated by Google) I ordered a Salmon dish, and since I'm allergic to cucus and quinoa, I told them, and they brought me the Salmon dish but honestly, it was not delicious, it was simple without flavor without salt without seasoning, my husband ordered the same dish of Salmon and He told me that the dish was excellent and juicy. Some restaurants should think about these situations so that everyone can enjoy their delicacies. Thanks to Ehite Horse restaurant.
