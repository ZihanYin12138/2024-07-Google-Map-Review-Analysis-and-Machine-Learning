I had Lasik about 6 months ago. Not only was the staff really good about answering all my questions, but I had fantastic results. I'm currently 20/15 and have loved never having to worry about glasses. They keep you on routine checkups and keep you informed the entire time. Would highly recommend.</text>

<Review>Wow! From the tech to service, this place totally exceed my expectations! Everyone is super friendly and helpful, if you are looking to get your lasik done, look no further! My eyes healed amazingly well, reached 20/20 the next day and 20/15 two weeks from surgery. I am very happy With my results and experience that I’ve shared with my friends and a few of them are in the process of getting it done as well, thank you Dr. Pham and team, this is a life changing event!</Review><Date>1622669384273<//Date></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I have my 6-month check up tomorrow, and I couldn't be happier with my new eyes! I highly recommend this place. It's a very nice office with snacks and drinks everywhere, and exceptionally friendly and caring staff. During the procedure, I felt about as comfortable as you can be because I knew I was in good hands. I'm a bioengineering PhD student, so I had tons of detailed questions (e.g. "so you just removed the flap?", "what is the reason for that device?", etc) and Dr. Pham was able to answer them perfectly while still keeping me at ease. Dr. Darrow is also extremely kind and helpful. My recovery was very fast and I achieved better than 20/20 vision, sooner than they told me I was supposed to. The only downsides are learning not to rub your eyes, some worsened night vision for the first few months, and apparently my contacts used to protect me from crying while cutting onions... Very much worth it for the convenience and comfort of knowing that my eyes finally just work.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Fantastic experience with San Diego LASIK institute. Dr. Pham did an excellent job on performing the surgery, with no complications to getting me to 20/20 vision. On the consult, my questions were answered by the staff working there which kept me at ease as we all only have one pairs of eyes. I went from a -6+ all the way to 20/20 with minor side effect. Just the eyes are a bit dryer now and require me to put extra eye drops in to keep them moisture. I’m glad I did the elective surgery and went with a surgeon who had a rep for doing quality work. A family member as well as my wife used Dr.Pham and both are happy with the results.  You can add another happy customer to the list.<//Review></record>

<Review>I had Lasik here with doctor Tony H. Pham and the day of my surgery I was a little nervous because I have never had it done before. He made me feel comfortable and calmed me down. He really cares about his patients and has a calm demeanor and makes sure your comfortable. The staff are also friendly and the lobby is always stocked with yummy snacks and coffee. The prior weeks before my surgery I had a bad reaction to my eyes being diluted. Dr Tony rushed back to the office even after hours to make sure I was ok and check my eyes. I was in a lot of pain and he gave me meds. He’s a very caring doctor and even called after to check on me. I recommend this place to get your eyes done. My friends have all had their eyes done here and had a good experience. You also get a discount if you were referred by a friend.</Review>< Pics>

The overall experience exceeded my expectations. It’s been a month in after my surgery and I’m beyond satisfied with the results. The staff is exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Dr. Pham is very patient and a perfectionist. If you’re researching or debating on LASIK surgery, I would encourage you to have your consultation with this facility. A HUGE THANK YOU to the team at the San Diego LASIK Institute! ☺️< /Text>

<text>I have thought about having Lasik for years and was always a bit nervous and hesitant. I decided to go for a consultation to check out the facilities and pricing. Everyone was incredibly nice, thorough, and insightful on the process. I knew I was in great hands with Dr. Darrow and Dr. Pham. The day after surgery I was seeing 20/15 and now 3 weeks later am seeing great and minimal pain. I would gladly recommend San Diego LASIK Institute to my family and friends. Thank you!< /text>< pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I waited a while to write this review just to make sure everything was settled.  I also don’t usually post reviews online.  But I am so happy with my results!  It’s been almost a year post-surgery, and my experience with San Diego LASIK Institute, and their Orange County office, has been absolutely top-notch!

I started looking at LASIK options after being told I’d be a good candidate during an optometry appointment to get new glasses/contacts.  I was also tired of getting constant eye infections from surfing with contacts, and with an active lifestyle didn’t like wearing glasses.  I didn’t know where to start so I Googled ‘San Diego LASIK’, found these guys, and made an appointment for my free exam and candidate assessment.

My experience with both offices has been excellent.  I was back and forth from Orange Country and San Diego for work, so I ended up doing my assessment and pre-op stuff in San Diego, getting my surgery in Orange County, and having follow-up appointments at both locations.  The offices communicate with each other, and have been great accommodating my schedule while traveling back and forth.  The staffs are friendly, professional, responsive, and extremely helpful.

Before surgery, I received probably the most thorough eye exam I’d ever had.  Dr Pham is great!  He had a long discussion with me about options due to my unique eye circumstances.  He recommended I go with the ‘monovision’ option, correcting just one eye.  It made sense; the goal was to not have to wear any glasses.  My near vision was actually good, despite most of my age group having to now wear ‘readers’ for looking at anything close up.  It was my far vision that had shifted over the years and needed correction.  I agreed, and they only did surgery on one eye, with the understanding that I could always get it on the other eye later.  This also saved me a lot of money!  Cost was reasonable; they had great financing options and I also went with the lifetime eye maintenance plan.

The surgery itself was unbelievably quick, literally seconds, and I followed doctor’s orders exactly before and after.  They have a great process that makes you feel comfortable with what they are doing, as it is a bit daunting to mess with the only eyes you’ve got!  Post surgery experience was as advertised; you go home, go to sleep, and wake up with new eyes!  The vision results were immediate and significant.  There are some lifestyle limitations for the first few weeks as you let your eyes heal (swimming, working out, contact sports, etc.), but it’s well worth it!  I did have to keep my eye lubricated with artificial tears for about 6 months as it tended to get dry (this is normal and expected).  There was also a bit of an adjustment for the monovision over the first few months as my eyes initially fought over which one would focus at about arm’s length (also normal and expected).  That’s pretty much resolved now (as they said it would) and I’m super happy with the results.

My only regret is that I did not do this years ago.  It’s a significant quality of life improvement not having to worry about contacts or glasses.  My one corrected eye is crystal clear for far vision, holding at better than 20/20.  My brain has adjusted accordingly and the monovision works great for both near and far vision.  Overall I definitely see better than when I had contacts in, or glasses on.  Huge difference surfing, driving, golfing, watching TV, attending concerts/sporting events, etc.  I also really notice the difference at night, things are so much sharper!

I would absolutely recommend the surgery and both/either San Diego and Orange County LASIK Institutes.  They know what they are doing and do it well!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>I’ll keep this simple and straight to the point! San Diego LASIK Institute was/ is hands down the smoothest experience. Pre op, surgery, and post op were all a breeze and painless. Went from being super nearsighted to seeing 20/15! I couldn’t be any happier with Dr. Pham, Dr. Darrow, Brandy, and the staff! Highly recommend if you are in the market for LASIK. They will treat you like family!</review>< time>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I highly recommend SD Lasik Institute. Everyone is super nice and they explain everything to you to keep your mind at ease of how safe the procedure is. The place has snacks and drinks EVERYWHERE and they have a charging station in the reception area. I didn't have anyone picking me up and opted for an Uber so one of the nurses walked me down and made sure I got in my Uber safe. Dr. Pham even called that night to make sure everything was okay but I was already asleep from the meds they gave me. Thank you to Dr. Pham and his team! I can enjoy the Christmas lights this holiday season :)<//Text>< Pics>

I had the best experience here from start to finish! The consultations allowed me to learn all I needed to know about the procedure and to see if I was a good candidate. The staff were nothing but kind and accommodating. During the surgery I was a bit nervous but the doctor put me at ease and it was over very quickly. They walk you through every step and answer all your questions. The recovery process was easy and quick, just make sure to follow all their directions. I recommend this place to everyone who talks about getting Lasik.<//review>

<text>It has been about two months since I got lasik eye surgery. I had a -6 eye prescription in each eye with a high astigmatism and a lazy eye. After getting three consultations from different lasik places I decided to get my surgery done by Tony Pham. They offer a lifetime option at a reasonable price. The office is very welcoming with many snacks and drinks. Dr Darrow who handles the consultations and after surgery visits is very informative and sweet. On the day of surgery I was very nervous. During the procedure MD tony Pham noticed this right away and did a very good job at taking time to calm me down. After surgery I had no complications other than eye dryness which is normal. The next day after surgery I could see at the 25 line. Now two months after surgery my vision is 20/20 which is better than predicted. I’m super happy with the outcome of this experience and so happy I decided to go with the San Diego lasik institute.</text>< userid>

<Review>I've had bad eyesight for my entire life. Glasses and contacts were super annoying because I'm pretty active outside, and my eyes are sensitive. My brother recommended SDLI with Dr. Pham, and my experience with them was phenomenal. I got the procedure done (super quick and easy ), the initial recovery was relatively quick and simple, and now I have 20/15 vision. Every day is literally like looking at the world through a new pair of eyes. If you have the means to get lasik, do it quick , and do it through SDLI.< /Review>< date>

Had the surgery 6 months ago and my eyes are still perfect! Worth the one night of pain and 3 months of needing drops. Prior to the surgery my eyes had a prescription around 5.75 each eye near sighted, but now my eyes see at 20/15 (better than 20/20) each! Best investment I made in myself. Just spent the past 3 months traveling without having to worry about glasses or contacts.<//Review>

It's been 6 months since my lasik eye surgery and it's the best decision I've ever made. I honestly don't even remember sometimes that I wore glasses before. I had the best experience ever with everyone at the San Diego Lasik Institute. The lasik surgeon was beyond amazing, I was pretty anxious and the doctor was great he talked me through every step and let me have a break in between eyes. The procedure was very quick and fast, I really loved that the doctor treated me like I was the only patient and is a perfectionist, if I had to do it all over again I definitely would. Thank you everyone on staff for always being great and welcoming. I have recommend everyone to come here, It's so worth the 2 and half hour drive for me.<//text>

This place is amazing and extremely professional. The doctors are very open and informative. They have a great set up and team, always ensuring great customer service.

Consultation was free and informative. They answered all my questions.

On surgery day the surgeon made me feel very comfortable, despite the anxiety I had. The procedure was quick and I was able to go home right after. (A driver is needed)

Although every outcome is different, I am pleased and amazed to say that I have 20/20 vision. It's as though I am wearing my glasses/contacts 24hrs a day. And what was shocking is I had 20/20 vision immediately the day after surgery. (A next day follow up is scheduled)

The follow up appointments are great. The doctors and staff encourage any way to make their office better, and most importantly to take care of their clients.</Text>

I had PRK surgery performed here in October of 2018. I couldnt be happier with the results. Thanks to Dr. Pham I was able to pursue my dream of a career in aviation and am currently flying helicopters for the Army. After my surgery the staff was extremely helpful with filling out all the paperwork I needed for the military processing center, and for my flight physical. I am still grateful every day for my new vision. Thank you!</text>

Their entire staff was warm and welcoming and very knowledgeable. The day of surgery, they did a great job of calming me down and did an amazing job.

6 months later and I’m seeing 20/15 in both eyes, no complications, couldn’t be happier. Would definitely recommend!</Review>< pictures>

The San Diego Lasik Institute staff was amazing from start to finish. From the initial consultation to surgery day, to my follow up appointment, the experience was the best I could have imagined. Dr. Pham and his staff walk you through each step of the way to make sure you are comfortable and at ease. Surgery time seemed like 5 minutes and experienced no pain or discomfort. Thanks for the life changing experience!<//Text>

My experience here at San Diego LASIK Institute was amazing! The staff are all great. The office is clean and if you are a fan of snacks, the office has an abundance of options. I definitely felt like appreciated and not as another patient. Dr. Pham makes sure to explain the whole procedure and makes sure that you are comfortable. I got lasik done in the morning and went home and went to sleep, by the time I woke up my vision was near perfect! Dr. Darrow was great with my follow up checkups, she was very friendly like the entire staff at the office. I would definitely recommend anybody who is considering Lasik to this office. You will not be disappointed!< /Review>

I'm writing this review the morning after my surgery.  The procedure itself was really quick and easy - just be ready for a burning sensation in your eyes while trying to sleep afterwards. One small thing I would recommend is providing melatonin to your patients to help you sleep because the valium didn't really help me. The staff here are phenomenal - they answered all of my questions and provided high quality service.  Not to mention that they have a variety of snacks in each room, even for a healthy eater like myself - continue stocking up on the seaweed snacks because I ate them all!  I highly recommend San Diego Lasik Institute for anyone in the area looking to improve their vision.< /review>

Phenomenal experience.  The whole staff is extremely helpful and makes the experience amazing.  Doctors are gracious with their time and are always available to address any questions or concerns you may have.  I highly recomend them to anyone considering a lasik procedure.</Review>

Posting this on my 1 year anniversary.  Getting LASIK was one of the best experiences of my life and I went with a great institution.  I called to make an appointment then had me in within a week.  Once they cleared me as an ideal candidate we booked an appointment for the surgery day.  Lucky enough someone had cancelled and there was an appointment a few days later - a Friday afternoon no less! Perfect for a couple extra days of rehab (that I didn’t necessarily need but I appreciated). Should mention they have a lot of ways to finance the surgery.

Surgery day was very relaxing.  A lot of waiting but they hook you up with food and drinks.  The actually surgery took less than 10 minutes and Dr. Pham was warm, scientific, and made sure I was safe.

The surgery is weird but just deal with it.  Dr.Pham walked you thru every step and it makes you feel confident.  (The whole experience is a great party story too).  After surgery, they usher you around, my wife picked me up  and I was home. the next few hours were annoying but just tried to sleep.

Every doctor set up every expectation perfectly.  I knew what to expect and they gave me a solution to deal with it - whether medicine, instructions, outlines.  They were accurate.

I had a check in the next day, the following week, the following month, the following 3, 6 then finally today a year.

I have told everyone to come and you should too.<//text>

The doctor makes sure you are feeling comfortable each step of the way. The whole team is awesome. From the front desk to the doctors. I was able to see clear the next day. Burning was only for a little bit after surgery. I don’t regret doing this procedure. I can see now better than 20/20. I definitely recommend them.<//Text>< user_name>

Dr. Pham and his team have given my eyes a new lease on life. I had a contact prescription of 4.75 with astigmatism and now I'm seeing better than 20/20. It's amazing to wake up and see everything clearly. The team was great at calming my fears during the procedure process. I found Dr. Pham to be very calming, as well, during surgery when he gave me prompts of what he was doing. Their after-surgery care has been wonderful. They all seem genuinely excited that I can see. Thank you San Diego LASIK Institute team for your care!< /Text>

I wish I had done LASIK 10 years ago! All these 5 stars are very accurate.  Everyone on the staff is extremely knowledgeable, polite, and professional.  I felt very comfortable from the moment I walked in and knew I would be in good hands.  I had no anxiety the day of my procedure because I was confident that I would get top notch service, which I did.  The actual procedure was quick and painless.  The recovery was much better than I expected, and I was seeing 20/20 the same evening.  When I went in for my follow-up the next morning (less than 24 hours later) they confirmed that I as seeing 20/20.  I just went in for my 2-week follow-up and I was almost seeing 20/15, so my vision has sharpened up even more!  I would recommend this place to anyone who is looking for LASIK.</Text>

I am very satisfied with the experience I had at San Diego Lasik Institute. The whole process was smooth and stress free. Dr. Pham and their staff are very professional and personable, making you feel at ease and well taken care of. I had a very high degree of correction needed and there was no guarantee that I would be 20/20. But I am happy to announce my results are spectacular. I had a clear vision a few days after the surgery. Just follow the instructions and do everything they tell you and you will recover quickly and painlessly. My only regret is that I have not done it sooner!<//Review>

I highly recommend San Diego LASIK Institute for anyone seeking vision correction! Dr. Pham and Dr. Darrow were extremely helpful and informative, and made the whole process easy. Day of surgery was smooth and my mom was able to watch the procedure from a viewing room which was really cool! She could even take videos. Thank you very much San Diego Lasik team!<//text>

<Review>I had an amazing experience with the San Diego Lasik institute. The staff is amazing! They were all super friendly and answered any questions I had. I was able to get an appointment quickly and have my eyes done the next week! I went from having -6.50 to 20/20 vision the next day and 20/15 vision within 2 weeks! I have worn glasses for over 20 years, so I'm loving being able to finally see! I highly recommend going here to get your eyes done! I look forward to each of my follow up visits :)</Review><time>1510113792902</time><user_id>112741158063465494450</user_id></record>

<date>1582826433811</date><rating>5</rating><text>I have wanted to get LASIK for as long as I can remember. Recently I started looking on yelp to find somewhere in San Diego. Per the yelp reviews, San Diego LASIK Institute was one of the best. Let me tell you, those reviews were Spot on!! I came in for a consultation to see if I was a candidate on Monday (luckily I was!) and I scheduled my surgery for Wednesday. On Monday, the entire staff made me feel so at ease. Dr. Darrow and Brandy answered all of my questions and were ridiculously nice. I did not feel rushed at all. Also, there are snacks in literally every room haha. On the day of surgery I was a little nervous, but again the staff was wonderful at making me feel better. They give you a relaxation pill before surgery that helps as well. Surgery was super quick and Dr. Pham talked me through the entire thing! The surgery room even has a giant glass window so friends/ family can watch and take photos! After surgery, my eyes did burn pretty bad. However, they give you a couple valum to help sleep for the next 8 hours so you hopefully won’t feel a thing. The pills didn’t work that well on me, but I took some Tylenol PM and was able to sleep. I woke up the next day and was able to see!! I also had a missed call on my phone at 8pm from Dr. Pham just calling to check in. That is some top notch care if you ask me :) At my follow up appointment the next morning I was able to see the bottom line of letters...20/20 vision. A million thank yous to the entire staff at San Diego LASIK for giving me vision!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Review>Excellent place to get Lasik. The staff was PHENOMENAL! The process was amazing. My vision was -6.75 in both eyes. I couldn't even see the big "E" clear. It's been exactly two weeks and I have 20/15 vision! Every morning I'm able to wake up and not have to put my glasses on to see.  As I said I HIGHLY recommend San Diego Lasik Institute if you are looking for a place to get Lasik.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Absolutely Amazing.

All of the staff is incredibly friendly, they walk you through the entire process and make you feel like your part of their family.

When contacting them they were extremely helpful and responsive. They have various forms of payments to fit your financial situation as well.

I can't recommend them enough. I am literally writing this a day after my surgery. I wore glasses since 1st grade and it feels so liberating to be done with them!

I was recommended by my coworker who is also extremely satisfied and is still enjoying amazing results months after his surgery.

100% recommended! Oh, they have FREE consultation, so at least do that and I am sure you'll fall in love with this office :)</Text>< Name>

The staff here is so friendly and put both myself and my family at ease. Honestly, even working in the medical field i was really nervous about having this done but it turned out to be a very easy and quick and nearly painless procedure. I had a wonderful experience and the doctor was incredibly warm and caring and truly cares about what he does. This was a life changing experience and I look forward to my life with 20/20 vision!! If i had the choice to do it over again i would do it in a heart beat, even my sister is excited to now have it done too!< /Text>

<review>I enjoyed my experience getting LASIK eye surgery at the San Diego LASIK Institute. The staff is friendly, and there are always plenty of snacks in the office. For follow-up appointments post-surgery, the receptionists are very easy to talk to and super accommodating when it comes to rescheduling.

Dr. Pham is extremely professional and put me at ease during the procedure. The same-day recovery was probably the only bad part, as you're instructed to sleep as soon as you get home from the procedure, but I woke up in the middle and it felt as if my eyes were burning (thankfully, the pain meds they prescribe you make this go away quickly). Overall, I would recommend this office if you're thinking of getting LASIK. It's been 6 months now and there's been a significant improvement in my vision; working a 40 hour work week staring at a computer screen may negatively affect how much better my vision could be post-surgery, but the change is noticeable and still well worth it.

The best part about my experience getting LASIK would have to be the 0% interest deal they offer with Wells Fargo (so long as you pay a monthly chunk of the full amount of the LASIK cost in under two years, no additional interest or charges will apply). It made getting LASIK affordable and easy, as I only have to worry about a reasonable monthly cost.

Dr. Darrow who I've seen for all my follow-up appointments after surgery with Dr. Pham is super kind too! However, the follow-up appointments seem to last less than 5 minutes each visit as they do an eye exam and shine a light on your eyes every 3-month, 6-month, and 1-year visit. I'm not too sure how effective these appointments are, as they consistently tell me each time that my eyesight is phenomenal but I wonder if the necessary steps would be taken to address any potential issues with my eyes if there were any to arise because these all seem to be pretty routine and once the LASIK is complete, I'm not too sure how much attention and care they can give. Currently, it feels as if my vision is significantly improved overall, but there are times it can get blurry and today's eye exam included in my 6-month follow-up appointment worried me somewhat in that I had slight trouble with reading the letters on the slides, but was still told I had phenomenal vision. Overall, for the price, the bedside manner and skill set of Dr. Pham, and the friendliness of the office staff, it's still worth it to get your LASIK procedure done here.</review><Date>1577414658263<//Date>< UserId.>

<rate>5<//rate><review>A process that brings such intense nervousness; "will I be potentially blind?", "will they cut up my eye and I feel pain forever?", etc,.. is brought to a worry free state by the staff(beyond caring and amazing) and doctors here. Over the course of hours of one on one discussion and testing, a video to go over the risks and effects, and time with the doctors to go over your every question virtually eliminates all possible nerves. In surgery Dr. Pham talks you through every step of what he needs from you and what he is doing down to even him just putting on his surgical gloves. The surgery itself was painless and nearly without any discomfort at all while Dr. Pham tells you what a great job you're doing. My vision is perfect now. Pricing here is extremely affordable with numerous paying options. They do offer a military discount. I highly recommend getting your LASIK done here.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

*writing review on behalf of Nathan Sadrai*
My husband, Nathan, got his lasik surgery this past October and he couldn't be happier with his results or his doctor!
Per Nathan, Dr. Tony Pham and Dr. Barrow were nothing short of amazing during, what can be, a nervous process. I have been wearing contacts since I was a teenager. The surgery itself was quick and painless and the entire staff was great post op and making sure I had everything I needed and all the instructions to have a successful surgery. Dr. Pham followed up on his own a few times post surgery and made sure everything was going well and even was available via text for my own questions.
Highly recommend this #1 lasik surgeon and institute!
Thanks to San Diego Lasik Institute!<//Review>

< review>
Feel like I need to leave a review everywhere I can because I am just so excited with my Experience. AMAZING. I went to five other providers that were closer to where I live (North County) but something didn't feel quite right with any of them. Luckily I decided to expand my distance and found San Diego LASIK Institute. I'm so happy I did. I've never been to an office and felt so much like family than here. Everyone in the office went out of their way to make sure I felt comfortable. Here are just a few things that exceeded my expectations:

-Staff (every single person blew me away from Claire at the front desk, to Kristy and Brandy with the testing and of course Dr. Darrow and Dr. Pham with premier-level service/surgery) I feel like family to them and love our joking/conversations
-Environment (Very comforting and friendly. Snacks/drinks everywhere I go. Top-Quality machines and information. I felt like I knew everything that was going on)
-Service (Best of the best. Every step of the way I felt comfortable and knowledgeable. They truly had my best interest in mind and I could feel it)
-Results (Why did I wait this long?? This is the best money I ever spent. I can see perfectly now and can't wait to truly enjoy and see everything life has to offer)

I only had to travel 45 minutes to get to this place but I would've traveled to another state to come here. Not to mention they are on 2020 Plaza... talk about auspicious. The quality of service and results was worth everything and more. Can't thank this team enough! Much love to you all.< /review>

<Text>The staff here is so friendly and put both myself and my family at ease. Honestly, even working in the medical field i was really nervous about having this done but it turned out to be a very easy and quick and nearly painless procedure. I had a wonderful experience and the doctor was incredibly warm and caring and truly cares about what he does. This was a life changing experience and I look forward to my life with 20/20 vision!! If i had the choice to do it over again i would do it in a heart beat, even my sister is excited to now have it done too!<//Text>< pics>

<review>I just got my eyes done with Dr. Pham. I would definitely recommend anyone to get their correction done at this office. They offer professional services and are very informative throughout the entire process. The staff was very friendly and I felt comfortable about the procedure. Everything was explained very well so that I would know exactly what was getting done. They were accommodating since I was driving from out of town to have the procedure done. My vision is now 20/15 and close to 20/10, which I guess is very rare. Thanks to them I will be able to perform my job better, which for me is huge. I am a firefighter and having great vision is very important to be able to perform effectively. Thanks so much for everything and I definitely recommend them.</review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Did the LASIK surgery here is one of the best decisions I've ever made.  Everyone is nice and friendly here, including the staffs and doctors.  They explained everything very clearly, no hidden fees or pushing you to buy additional stuff.  Doctor Pham is so patient and careful all the time during the surgery.  I was very nervous, but he kept encouraginge and told me how much longer it will take to finish the surgery, which makes me feel much better.  After the surgery is done, he exam my eyes very carefully and make sure everything looks good.  He even repeated the last part of the surgery again just to make sure my wound is perfectly covered.  I was not 100% sure all the five stars reviews here are real, but after I've done my surgery, I'm pretty sure they are real.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< time>

< Review>
Two years ago I was terrified at the thought of getting Lasik eye surgery, but I honestly had nothing to be scared of. The WHOLE staff at San Diego Lasik Institute are so kind and friendly (shout-out to Theresa, Claire, Brandy, Kristy, Dr. Darrow and Dr. Pham ), and the actually surgery itself wasn't too bad either.

Events I went through:
1) Consultation. Pray that you are eligible for Lasik because it really is a game changer.
2) Pre-op appointment to get your eyeballs scanned and ready for surgery
3) Surgery day! Try to have a friend or family member be available to take you there and back home. If not, they will help you grab an Uber or Lyft.
4) Same day post surgery. Sleep 8 hours. I slept 16 which was the best sleep of my life.
5) Recovery period. DONT TOUCH YOUR EYES! This only lasts 5-7 days but it's crucial! They even give you goggles to ensure you don't!
6) Next day checkup. I was already seeing 20/20 at this time and was well enough to go straight to work afterwards. Having this happen absolutely blew my mind!
7) 2 week checkup. Recovery period went well and happy to report I'm seeing at 20/15 vision!

Getting Lasik was the best investment in myself that I've ever done. No longer do i have to wake up and put contacts in or have to take contacts out before sleeping. And I never EVER have to avoid spicy food again since, well... no contacts

If you're tired of contacts or wearing glasses, do yourself a favor and make the investment in yourself. You won't regret it!<//Review>

I had my surgery two weeks ago and I am so glad I chose San Diego LASIK Institute! I now have 20/20 vision in both eyes and my recovery process was quick and easy. Dr. Pham was great at calming my nerves during surgery by talking me through the procedures. Dr. Darrow was very helpful with all my questions and her positive disposition always puts me in a great mood after seeing her. I strongly recommend having LASIK surgery and choosing these doctors!< /text>

I had a very positive experience getting LASIK surgery here. The doctors are very helpful and answered my long list of questions. They do a lot to alleviate your worries and make you confident that your eyes are in good hands.

It's been a month and a half since the surgery. There has never been any pain and the initial side-effects (halos around lights, dry eyes) have mostly disappeared, months ahead of schedule. I'm glad I got this done and glad I chose this place. My distance vision is great.

I would give this place 5 stars except for one thing. My very near vision was affected significantly. If I try to focus on something that is less than six inches away from my face, I feel woozy. This means I can't put my face close to a mirror. The doctor mentioned that my near vision would be impacted but, I feel, understated the degree of it. This may be unique to me and it might lessen over time, in which case, I'll change this to 5 stars. Knowing this now, I would still choose the surgery. Distance vision is more useful, after all.

Full disclosure: In my follow up visit, they asked me whether I was happy I had had the surgery and, after I said yes, offered me an Amazon gift card for writing this review.<//Text>

<text>I couldn't be happier with service I received over here. I was very worried since it is critical transitioning time in my life. Everyone is very helpful and courteous. They answer all my questions very patiently. Initial exam was done without any commitment. Believe me, I thought a thousand times before surgery date feeling worried. But all their answers and support made the actual day a lot smoother. Dr. Pham himself did another check up before the actual surgery. He and Dr Darrow were very thorough and supportive. Procedure went smoothly and result was amazing. Thank you for your continuous care and we wish you well to all amazing team.<//text>< Pictures>

Dr.Pham and his team are the best. Richard, April, Dr.Darrow & Theresa are amazing,  so friendly, they truly make you feel like family. Getting Lasik done (and especially here, with them) was legit 1 of the best decisions I've ever made. Procedure was smooth and I woke up the next day pain free with perfect vision! No discomfort, no irritation, just crystal clear vision.<//Review>

Dr. Irina Darrow is very pleasant and knowledgeable. She answered and satisfied all of my inquiries with confidence. She is very friendly and professional. Even if i only went in for a consultation, immediately i knew i would be safe in their competent care.

Day of surgery. Dr. Pham was warm, skillful and precise. My sugery took all of 5 minutes (i was counting in my head) for both eyes. Procedure was pain free and i was up and about day after surgery.

I highly recommend San Diego Lasik institute for your vision needs. I am now 20/20 on my right eye (far vision) and 20/30 on my left eye (near vision) and it will still get better!

The snacks all around the office sweetened the experience for me! ♥️</text>

I'd been wanting to get LASIK every since I ever started wearing glasses. When I came to the San Diego LASIK Institute for my pre-screening, everyone I talked with was incredibly helpful, professional, and friendly in a no-pressure kind of way. When it came time to shoot some lasers into my eyeballs, Dr. Pham and his staff did an amazing job making sure I was completely comfortable and walked me through every step of the procedure. I went from -3.50 to 20/15 and it's still sinking in that I can just fall asleep or wake up and immediately see. To anyone considering LASIK I cannot recommend it highly enough, and if you are looking for a friendly and professional place to get it I can absolutely recommend Dr. Pham and his team.< /Text>

The staff was great right from day one - they addressed all my questions and concerns quickly and made sure I had multiple contacts at the office - Kristy in the office has been particularly helpful with my dozen or so follow up emails (Thanks!). The surgery went exactly as they described and there were no surprises or hidden fees. My vision was terrible before but  I was 20/20 in both eyes the day following surgery. I highly recommend this office to anyone considering LASIK!</Review>

Before I received Lasik with Dr. Pham back in 2014, I went to a free consultation at two other places. The first said that there was no way that I could do Lasik because my eyes were too bad. The second one was just unprofessional. Third time is the charm they say. 5 years later and my vision is still great. Both Dr. Pham and Dr. Darrow were wonderful. They were kind, helpful, and professional. They not only helped eased my concerns before the procedure but also after. I especially appreciated the fact that Dr. Pham would call the night after the surgery to check on me and see how I was doing.

If you can afford and are medically cleared to get Lasik, I recommend getting it with them. It's an incredible feeling to wake up in the morning and see clearly for the first time since you were a child. I had worn glasses so long that I kept reaching for my "glasses" at least 6 months after my surgery.</text>

Dr. Pham and the San Diego LASIK Institute is a great place if not THE place to go to get LASIK. I am 2 weeks out and so pumped that I made the decision to get LASIK. I am seeing 20/15 and my eyes legitimately feel normal. So first if you are just thinking about LASIK go and take the free consultation, that's what I did and they walk through everything really well with you and let you ask any question you want, they don't pressure you in any way the ball is always in your court, but I'm telling you its so legit to be able to see well. I'm a young guy and I am pumped to not have to worry about contacts or glasses for the prime of my life. Then surgery day is so easy, its quick and they are really good at explaining everything that goes on right while it happens, which made me feel so much more comfortable. LASIK is great and this is a great place to get it done.<//text>

They were so careful and thorough. I was really scared at first about my procedure, but Dr. Pham walked me through every detail and I was at ease with the security of the confidence and comfort they provided. I now have 20/15 vision and every penny is worth it! Everyone on the staff is friendly and supportive and made the whole experience enjoyable.<//text>

My experience with Dr. Tony Pham, Dr. Irina Darrow, and the whole San Diego LASIK Institute was nothing short of amazing! They’re motto was to treat their customers as if they were family, and they fell nothing short of that! From the snacks & beverages to their wonderful demeanors, I truly felt like I was at home.
My conversations with their staff were extraordinary. I felt like everyone went above and beyond and took the time to answer ALL my questions, and I had A LOT of them! From financing to the actual procedure to post care, nothing was left up in the air. The customer service I received was unparalleled and I am so happy I chose to have my LASIK procedure done here. The procedure itself was 100% painless, and Dr. Tony Pham and his assistant literally talked to me the whole time. I had absolutely zero stress! Honestly, my only regret is that I didn’t come sooner! 😀<//text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>Simply put: if you’re thinking about getting lasik- GO HERE. I did some research online before deciding I wanted to go through with it. Fortunately found the San Diego Lasik Institute. From the moment I walked in the staff was friendly and professional. Fast forward the procedure was quick and painless- Dr. Pham is the best! Was seeing 20/20 the next day. 2 weeks later seeing 20/15. Really happy with decision to go with lasik and with the San Diego Lasik Institute. Your eyes are not something you want to take chances with- do yourself a favor invest in going with the best in San Diego.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

Dr.Pham and his team are the best. Richard, April, Dr.Darrow & Theresa are amazing,  so friendly, they truly make you feel like family. Getting Lasik done (and especially here, with them) was legit 1 of the best decisions I've ever made. Procedure was smooth and I woke up the next day pain free with perfect vision! No discomfort, no irritation, just crystal clear vision.</Text>

Exceptional! I had PRK two weeks ago, and the whole experience with San Diego Lasik, Dr. Pham, Dr. Darrow, and the staff has been wonderful!! The consultation was informative and efficient. Scheduling is easy. They are on-time, friendly, and professional. The procedure went smoothly - Dr. Pham talks you through and makes it very easy to be calm. Follow up care with Dr. Darrow is wonderful. I can’t say enough good things!
I wholeheartedly recommend San Diego LASIK!!< /Text>

<Review>I had my surgery less than 24 hours ago and I can see perfectly. After wearing glasses for over 30 years it is an amazing experience. From the initial consult to follow ups, everyone from the front desk staff, to the nurses, and Dr. Phan have been professional, thoughtful, and great to work with.

I would not hesitate to recommend them!</Review>< Pictures>

<username>Vincent Pham< /username><text>Got traditional LASIK surgery exactly a month ago today. I couldn’t be happier with the results. I can see 20/20 in both eyes now and all the minor symptoms of post-op (dry eyes, haziness, etc) are basically gone. The staff is very welcoming and friendly too.

Dr. Pham is an exceptional doctor who will coach you through the whole process before, during, and after. Having never worn contacts previously (glasses only), I was nervous about the thought of shooting lasers in my eyes. But Dr. Pham was able to talk me through the whole process and the process itself was way easier than I imagined and virtually pain free.

The price here was more affordable than the 2 other places I went to for consultations too. It’s no wonder they are the best place in town.

Thank you San Diego LASIK for giving my vision a reset!<//text>< Rate>

<Text>I thoroughly enjoyed my experience at the San Diego Lasik Institute Office. The staff was professional and answered all my questions. The fact that they were able to confirm my current prescription exactly indicated to me they knew what they were doing. I knew afterwards that I wanted to get the Lasik surgery done and I didn’t want to wait any longer. I was able to schedule my surgery the week after and it has only been five days since my surgery but I am very satisfied with the results. I would definitely recommend Dr. Pham and their office staff if you are considering having the procedure done.</Text>< Date>

Dr. Pham and Dr. Darrow are the absolute best in the business!!  They had me seeing 20/15 two weeks after LASIK!  I'd recommend San Diego Lasik Institute to all of my friends and family.  If you're considering LASIK or PRK, do not wait any longer, go see Dr. Pham and Dr. Darrow today!!< /text>

100% recommend! I’m less than 24hr post op, a little swollen, but I can see perfectly :D Amber, Irina, and Dr Pham are who I mainly interacted with, and they were so personable. They made an experience that could be really nerve wracking laid back and easy. Dr Pham even called me at 10pm to check in how I was doing. I thought that was reaaally thoughtful.

I've had two different LASIK eye procedures with Dr. Pham, and Dr. Darrow and their team, and they are superb, highly recommended. I had LASIK on only my right eye first (so my other eye could still be used for near/reading vision, to avoid needing reading glasses for normal daily use) about 5 years ago, went amazingly well, zero downtime, went to sleep afterwards and woke up with no pain and seeing great - superb 20/15 distance vision even now.

Then about a year ago I decided to do the left eye as well, because my right eye had adjusted for near/reading use as well, and the left eye was now even worse for distance, requiring contacts or prescription glasses to enjoy movies or TV. The left eye went even better, with the latest in LASIK offering something like 4X better definition in correction, again went to sleep after the procedure and woke up without pain and seeing great, and now I have 20/15 in both eyes, and can still read and see near without reading glasses.

The aftercare and all checkups are included and important to monitor any healing changes and catch even the smallest issues right away. I had zero issues and everything looks great days, a week, months and even years later, the microscopic healing of the eyes went great.

They offer great financing options, and I was able to finance each procedure over 24 months same as cash.

They also offered and may still offer future vision corrections at no charge for a very small added fee, so in another 5 or 10 years, I may get one or both eyes redone if possible, as eyes lose distance naturally as you age.

All in all, nothing to be scared about, painless, financing options, and perfect vision - go in for a free consultation and see if you're a good candidate for what I call bionic vision! :-)

<user_id>116705333793402474342<//user_id><resp>None<//resp><text>Incredibly friendly and professional staff. The doctors and staff have remarkably friendly demeanors and made me feel comfortable.

The most important factor for me was their attention to detail. I didn't want a Lasik factory that would rubber stamp my surgery. Dr. Pham and Dr. Darrow triple and quadruple-checked my measurements to make sure I was getting the best possible outcome. I was reassured that I was a unique patient and was treated with an exceptional level of care.

I would strongly recommend going to SD Lasik Institute. Even if you've already had a consultation at another clinic.< /text>< Rate>

<text>It’s been two weeks since I had my Lasik surgery with Dr Tony Pham and I am so happy I made the decision to do it.

What really sold me on using Dr Pham at San Diego Lasik institute were the awesome staff, especially the initial consultation with Dr Darrow. After several tests, she informed me that the next step would be for them to make contact lenses to give me a “test run” of what my vision would be like if I was to follow through with the surgery! I was surprised and impressed that they would provide this service as I was expecting they’d be only too happy to take a deposit immediately! But they wanted me to be certain and that is a big reason why I chose them.

The contacts were great and I went back in for a follow up and to set up an appointment for the surgery. They were very thorough in testing me and  in explaining what to expect pre and post-surgery. When I met Dr Pham, he was kind, patient and informative. I felt very comfortable, even though I was a little nervous! Dr Pham walked me through each procedure as he performed the surgery. I had clear instructions for after-care which I followed and now, two weeks later, I’m healing up fast and my eyesight just keeps getting better.

I highly recommend this surgery and these folks to do it for you.</text>< Pics>

Been wanting to get lasik for a long time so I decided to search places that offered lasik in my area here on yelp. San Diego Lasik Institute was the top rated so I search more about them, read reviews about them until I decided to contact them and make an appointment. All the staff are very nice and accommodating. They have free snacks and drinks. Dr. Darrow and Dr. Pham are very professional.

So if you guys wanted to have a lasik, DO IT!!
That's the best decision I've ever made and it's totally worth it. And of course choose San Diego Lasik Institute. They're the best!< /review>

The office itself is super clean and neat. I would recommend anyone that is ready to take the step of getting lasik. My experience before and after the surgery was great. I love how I can wake up in the morning and can see perfectly clear. I really felt like my dreams came true if it wasn't for San Diego lasik Institute.< /text>< user>

Dr. Darrow is so informative and helpful with all of my questions. Last but not least Dr. Pham did an outstanding job of calming my nerves during surgery. He even called me after to check how I was doing. I am absolutely in love with this practice. My vision is now better than what I ad with glasses or contacts. I am now fully prepared to take on a zombie apocalipse ;) or anything else that will come my way.</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I wanted to be sure and leave a review of my experience because I didn't see anything like it when I was searching.

I really wanted to get LASIK and decided to go with SDLI (after reading a lot of reviews from different places all over Southern California). I went in for my first consultation and had a great experience. It was quick, the entire staff was friendly, everyone was very informative. I met with Dr. Darrow on this visit and she was amazing. She did notice some extra blood vessels around my cornea so she wanted me to come back for my second consultation when Dr. Pham was working to have him check it out. I left with such a great feeling and was very excited to be on my LASIK journey.

On my second visit, I saw Dr. Pham who was very friendly and informative. He confirmed what Dr. Darrow saw and recommended I hold off on LASIK until I had my eyes checked by a corneal specialist. Dr. Pham explained everything extremely well and even had me pull out my phone so he can show me what to search for to learn more.

This is where I'm at now. I have an appointment with a specialist and hopefully will continue towards LASIK. I kind of assumed that a lasik dr would push lasik no matter what - even if was a higher risk case. The fact that I had two visits, spoke with two great doctors, and never once felt pressured or confused about what was going on says a lot about SDLI and their crew.

I can't say enough great things about them. If you are thinking about LASIK I strongly encourage you to check them out.

Pro tip - They have snacks everywhere, so maybe skip lunch and chow down there haha.</review><username>Dave Gostenhofer< /username>< userid>

I came in to just explore my options because I was tired of wearing contacts. It was exhausting putting them in and taking them out every day l. I opened the door and felt the warm welcome immediately. The waiting room is very clean and offers snacks and water. Also the staff was amazing from the front desk to the doctor. Everyone was very helpful and I'm glad I came here to get my eye surgery. Thank you to everyone who helped me along my journey.<//Review>

<text>One day later and I have 20/15 vision! I was hesitant at first and even told I had a scar on my eye, but Dr. Pham and the staff made me feel beyond comfortable! Surgery was quick and relatively painless and the goggles they give you are PIMP! Dr. Darro was equally awesome and related to my situation of leaving the country 7 days after surgery. Staff was awesome, cost was on point, experience was phenomenal!< /text>< Response>

Amazing experience with Dr. Pham and his team!
For the first two consultations, Irina took care of me.
She is so comforting so calm and sweet, responded to all my questions with patience.
I was so excited the day of the surgery i probably ate their whole basket of snacks ( sorry that was me ).
But Dr. Pham took great care of me during the surgery.
I would just recommend to anyone, 20/20 now :)<//review>

The staff was great right from day one, and they addressed all my questions and concerns quickly. Kristy in the office has been particularly helpful with my follow up emails (Thanks!). The surgery went exactly as they described and there were no surprises or hidden fees.
Dr Pham had even called me the night after my surgery to check on me. I had little fuzzy vision in my left eye after long night in Thanksgiving and I got little freaked out and contacted their emergency hotline where they left a note for the doctor. I received called from Dr Pham in 10 minutes and he FaceTimed with me to check my eye and ensured me everything was fine.  My vision was not great before but  I was 20/20 in eye and 20/25 in the other the day following my surgery. I highly recommend this office to anyone considering LASIK!</text>

<time>1550740937336</time><rate>5<//rate><text>I had my LASIK surgery back in August 2018, and I had just attended my 6-month follow-up appointment last week. Getting LASIK was one of the best investments in my life. I'm extremely grateful of Dr. Pham and of his entire team- because ever since my first consultation visit, they have treated me nicely with phenomenal & exceptional customer service. Throughout my numerous follow-up visits, they had not only made me feel respected, but comfortable & at-ease throughout the whole process. I highly recommend Dr. Pham and his team for those still researching for a surgeon who they can ultimately trust. Another thing that stood out to me was when Dr. Pham called me on the same night I got operated on just to check up how I was doing! He and his team are all great and personable people!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

This place was amazing, the level of detail and attentiveness was out of this world. The whole procedure was pain free. Surgery happened, took a 6 hour nap, woke up and started playing video games. All the doctors and assistants were very professional and post-op follow ups were on point - scheduling was very flexible! Dr. Pham is one of the best in the business, he goes above and beyond the normal pre-op procedures to ensure 200% accuracy. 24-hours after surgery i had 20/15 vision and as i write this, i had my 2 week check up and STILL at 20/15. No regrets here and well worth the money!<//Text>

<review>The staff is amazing, the doctor is top notch.
I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process from beginning to end.
Thanks to Dr Pham, my vision is 20/15 and holding.

No pressure, honest, highly professional.
I would recommend Dr. Pham and this office to anyone!

I couldn't be happier with the results of my surgery and all the interactions with the doctors and staff at Dr. Pham's office.  The surgery itself was quick and completely painless.  By the next day I was living my normal life, but with 20/15 vision.  If you want top-class service and treatment, look no further than Dr. Pham's office.<//Review>

The experience was great from start to finish . The entire staff is friendly and genuine . The snacks they provide are in every single room which I'm not gonna lie I had many of .. And the actual procedure was quick and painless . My vision is already 20/20 and will continue to get sharper the next couple weeks .. I can't wait to fully heal .. So happy already ..

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>LASIK was something that I was always on the fence about. I wasn't going to get it done until I found the perfect office, perfect staff, and perfect doctor. When it comes to your eyes and vision, I think you can be a little picky. The San Diego Lasik Institute was the first place that I went to get a consultation and I was amazed by my experience. Everyone I met was friendly and extremely helpful with answering any questions that I had. After my appointment I knew that this was the place, I didn't need to go anywhere else for my consultation. 20/15 vision later I wpuld never regret mu decision to trust Dr. Pham and his staff with my eyes. San Diego Lasik Institute, thank you so much for everything!!!</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Awesome experience with SD Lasik Institute!! I was planning to get Lasik performed for a long time but was also very hesitant because of a few horror stories I've heard from friends. I could not be happier with my results. The convenience of not wearing contacts or glasses is well worth the money for the surgery.

I recommend paying cash/credit card because they provide a discount if you do so, and this makes the price very competitive, especially for the quality of service, technology, and snacks! The office is full of snacks. :o)

I highly recommend Dr. Darrow and Pham. Everyone whom I have encountered at SD Lasik Institute was friendly, professional, conscientious, and accommodating. Great experience. I've recommend Dr. Pham to even my sisters.

My eyes were R -4.25 / L -3.75. So far, I don't have any negative side effects. I do see larger haloes while driving in the evening, but that is supposed to wane over the next few months.</Review>

<userid>117464113235334728422</userid><date>1522518442901< /date><Name>Martin C<//Name><Text>My motivation for getting LASIK: Martin's body no longer accepts contact lenses. GPC. Dry eye. Discomfort. Halos. Difficulty driving at night. So I went for it.

Step 1: Free consultation to see if you're a candidate. Pretty quick and easy.

Step 2: A two-hour appointment to talk about "the scary stuff": complications, money, etc.

Step 3: Decide on financing, schedule the procedure, get LASIK.

I just had mine done and, though I didn't meet him until the day of the procedure, Dr. Pham was friendly, encouraging, and 100% professional. VERY detail oriented. Talks you through the whole thing, checks on you, encourages you. Regardless of the outcome of my procedure (so far, so very good), I'm pleased and impressed with Dr. Pham's service.

A bit about the procedure. In a word, fascinating. It's like staring into HAL's eye for a half hour. At times blurry, at times hazy. It's like driving through a downpour, with the wipers on, without your contacts in. The only uncomfortable part is the suction/pressure while they are making the flap. Otherwise, things are pretty easy. The Xanax helps. And the valium helps you sleep afterward.< /Text><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80d9551a0fb3fb53:0xe3edc58685042e30</Gmap_id>< pictures>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I've always thought about getting LASIK.  My friend recommended the San Diego LASIK Institute since he had his surgery there and he loved it.  He had no complications.

The staff is very welcoming.  Everyone is professional and has a smile on their face.  The whole facility is very nice and modern.  There's a large TV with drinks and snacks available in the waiting areas.

Of course I had my concerns with the procedure, but they showed me that they've had a long history and zero cases of complications.  I had my procedure earlier this year and I am very happy with the results.  Dr. Pham is knowledgeable on the subject and is very assuring.

If you have ever thought about getting this procedure, do it here!  They will let you know if you are a good candidate and they will offer you a lot of feasible options.  I will always recommend this procedure and this institute.  It literally took less than 10 minutes and I no longer have to deal with glasses or contacts!<//Text>< pics>

<review>I am just over two weeks past my surgery and the only thing I can say is it was life-changing. My actual results are way better than I could've ever imagined and I owe that all to Dr. Pham and his team! There really isn't a bad seed in the bunch; his entire team is so professional, and kind! The whole atmosphere is calm and inviting and it is obvious that they love what they do. If you are at all considering LASIK, you should seriously go to the free consultation with Dr. Pham. That's all it took for me, and now I'm only wondering why I didn't do it sooner!</review><Rating>5< /Rating>< GmapID>

The office is clean and inviting. My appointments were always on time without having to wait around. The plethora of snacks is a nice touch!

My initial recovery was a little longer than I was expecting. I would recommend taking a few days from work just to rest and recover. No pain or discomfort - just giving yourself time to adjust and rest.

I'm now a few weeks out and LOVING my clear vision. Who knew you could see so far? Definitely recommend this office if you are in San Diego!</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I just got my LASIK surgery on 10/26/16 so I'm three days post surgery. The entire experience from the consult to surgery and post op has been great. I had a very strong prescription and a lot of astigmatism in both eyes. Today I'm seeing 20/20 with both eyes. I do have a lot of dryness in one eye but Dr Pham has been seeing me everyday to follow up. The results have exceeded my expectations. I was also very nervous and was shaky at the start of surgery Dr. Pham does an excellent job calming your nerves. Recovery was easy once you can fall asleep. I woke up the next morning and watched my two toddlers with no problems. I highly recommend!< /text>

I wasn't ever overly interested in getting LASIK but after I had the procedure I wonder why I waited so long. I had no problems with wearing contacts but the convenience of not having to is priceless. The procedure was relatively quick (around 20 minutes or so) and easier than I was expected. After sleeping through the first day/night I woke up and could see! Unbelievable! Other than dryness I was good. Even went back to work the day after. The eye drop regiment is a bit tedious but only for one week. I still don't see 20/20 but more around 25/20, which since I was around 400/20 before, it's quite amazing. Also everyone at the office and Dr. Pham were amazing. So nice and patient with all my questions and concerns. I highly recommend Dr. Pham!</text>

Just had my 2 month post surgery follow up appointment. I'm seeing 20/15 and the world looks better than it ever has. Not having to wear glasses after wearing them for the last 20 years is incredibly liberating and I couldn't be happier about the decision to get LASIK. I wanted to go with the best care I could find for the procedure and I am confident I found that with Dr. Pham and his staff. They are friendly, professional, excellent at what they do, and they obviously care a great deal about their work anandd their patients. I've been recommending them to everyone anyone who asks and if you're thinking about getting corrective vision surgery you needn't look any further.</Review>

<review>Dr. Pham and his team has given me all in all a comfortable, swift, and very informative experience. Throughout the whole process from consultation to procedure to understanding post op appointments, it has been an easy and they have been absolutely accommodating. Many of my colleagues and recommended San Diego LASIK Institute as they had absolutely positive results years after and I had to go here. I flew all the way from SF to get it here because not only of the positive responses I have received, the research I've done looking for good services, and also the price! And most importantly, everyone make you feel comfortable throughout the process, everyone is absolutely friendly and are always asking what more they can do to make you feel at home. I think that's important for people who are nervous for any procedure and to gain trust that you are in great hands. Thanks to Dr Pham and the whole team!</review>< Pictures>

<text>Dr. Pham and his team exceeded my expectations. They were incredibly professional and kind. I used to have terrible vision and now it's 20/20. I highly recommend coming to the San Diego LASIK Institute to anyone who is thinking about it.</text>< pictures>

I was really looking forward to getting a LASIK procedure. The team at San Diego LASIK Institute made the entire process really easy. The price for the procedure was great and reasonable. The entire staff is super friendly and always made me feel comfortable. Dr. Pham is really chill and made the procedure quick & easy. I also really enjoyed the snacks there were readily available everywhere. ^_^<//review>

I should have had this procedure done long ago. Dr. Pham and the entire staff are professional, accomodating, and knowledgeable. I was anxious about the procedure but that quickly disapated during the surgery. It is painless, a strange experience, but painless and quick. Follow the directions and try to sleep directly after the surgery to avoid post procedure discomfort. I woke up the next morning with 20/20 vision and two months later tested at 20/15. I now have super cyborg eyes and it is awesome.< /Review>

<Review>At the San Diego LASIK Institute they really take the time to understand you and your vision needs. Dr Pham was great in helping understand what would happen the day of my surgery.

The rest of the staff was always super helpful and friendly. Would and have recommend the San Diego LASIK Institute.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

So glad I chose this place. Every single employees in this office was so nice and professional. They made you feel so comfortable that when I went in for consultation, I booked right away for the procedure and ended up cancelling my other 2 appointments some place else.

Day of procedure, went in. They did a few more exams, just to be sure (which made me feel good that they cared enough to be perfect (no mistakes whatsoever was going to happen). Everyone asked how I felt along the way. The procedure itself felt like 5 minutes or less.

At home, I knocked out but woke up (not sure how long I slept for) and there was stinging in my eye and I freaked out (they explain all this to you during consultation and even during exam day so it was me) so I called in and Dr. Pham calmed me down and explained what I should do.  I told my husband to go buy me Benadryl and that knocked me out till the next morning. Woke up and I feel great. No more stinging.

Im back in the office right now for my post checkup. Again, both gals here are so nice and friendly. Everything looks good she said. I'm good to go.

Would definitely recommend this to everyone and anyone considering it!!!<//text>

<text>Dr. Tony Pham and his wonderful staff have made my life so much better. Since I was in 6th grade I've needed glasses and now no more. When I went for my free consultation I knew I was going to get lasik I just didn't know from where and not even half way through my consultation I knew I had found the right place. I knew this because of how friendly and informative the staff were from Kristy the Finance Specialist to Dr. Irina. My consult was thorough and since I knew I wanted them to take care of my eyes they were even able to do my second appointment right after I finish my first and decided to proceed with them.
The day of my surgery I was a little nervous but as I said the staff there were so great and when I met Dr. Pham he walked me through everything step by step and made me feel at ease. The actual procedure seemed to take no time at all with no pain and just a little slight discomfort at one point. I went home slept off the surgery waking up 8 or so hours later feeling great. The next day at my follow up they informed me I was seeing 20 20 and just today I had another follow up where I found out I'm actually seeing 20 15 now. I am so glad with my decision to get lasik and to have it done with Dr. Pham and his staff they really make you feel welcomed. Oh and I forgot to mention this but Dr. Pham actually called me that night after the surgery and left a voicemail just wanting to check up on me and have me call him with any concerns or questions but at that point I was still sleeping and if you are reading this Dr. Pham I truly appreciated that so thank you. Also Dr. Irina is so nice and sunny every time I've had a follow up which just makes the whole experience so much better. If you are considering Lasik give The San Diego Lasik Institute a call you won't regret it.<//text><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

I was ready to get lasik but extremley nervous and scared to do the procedure. Despite fear I made the consultation. The entire staff was nice and knowledgeable. I left the consultation knowing exactly what the procedure is and how they do it. Day of surgery I had so much anxiety but Dr. Pham made me feel very comfortable before and during the procedure. I got all worked up for noting, the procedure was painless and over in minutes. The day after i could see!!! There was slight irritation In both eyes, like there was sand in them, but I could see!!!! Lasik is such an amazing life changing experience. Two weeks later my vision is perfect, eyes healing and the irritation is gone. I wake up seeing everything clearly! Thank you Dr. Pham and staff for being so caring throughout pre and post lasik surgery.

I had a wonderful experience with the San Diego Lasik Institue.  You feel welcome as soon as you walk in and the staff is very helpful with any questions or concerns you may have.  I had my surgery on Friday and it is an awesome feeling to wake up in the morning and not have to fumble around for glasses in order to see.  I have better vision than I did with my glasses.  The whole experience was way beyond any expectations I had going in.  Dr. Pham and Shiggy were awesome to deal with, they made sure I didn't have any questions and felt comfortable with the process.  I would highly recommend that if you are considering Lasik surgery go for it.  It will be the best decision you could ever make and this is the best place to go for the procedure.<//Review>

I'm sure everyone gets sick of glasses and contacts, especially when you work on the computer all day. That was the case for me and ever since I heard about LASIK from a friend, I really wanted to get it done for myself. My vision wasn't too bad at -0.5 but I had a bad astigmatism, which made my vision overall terrible. I recently moved to the bay area and looked at practices here for LASIK procedures. However, prices were too high and many practices had a lot of bad reviews. Since I'm originally from San Diego and my parents still lived there, I researched options here and stumbled upon San Diego Lasik Institute. They were the only practice who had a full 5 star rating on yelp and I believe google as well.

Since they are my eyes, I wanted to make sure I'm getting the best quality for the best value. Dr. Pham runs a smart practice in that he focuses solely on Wavefront Lasik (the latest technology out there). This is key to providing the BEST results to patients. I paid around 4k (since there was a discount at the time) in total for the whole procedure and man was it worth every single penny.

A couple weeks after my procedure, I checked in with an optometrist in the bay area and she told me my vision was 20/10 (with both eyes open) and 20/15 on each eye. That was insane, and I believed it, because I've never been able to see so clearly, and so far with contacts/glasses.

My biggest recommendation to people who choose to have the procedure here, please, FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS!

I followed the pre operative and post operative instructions carefully and this led to a MUCH faster recovery time than the majority of patients they see. I checked in with Dr. Darrow a month after my procedure and she told me this was the case. Today, it's been about 7 weeks since my procedure, and I have very little dry eyes (a symptom that takes about 3-6 moths to disappear). After the procedure, get as much rest as you can, and lubricate your eyes as much as possible with the artificial tears. Believe me, your eyes will heal much faster.

Dr. Phams practice has a great staff, especially with Dr. Darrow as his Optometrist. They are more than happy to answer any and all questions you may have about the procedure. I was nervous right before the procedure was done, just as everyone may be.. but Dr. Pham did a great job of giving you the confidence to relax, even just a tad bit. The procedure only took like 10 minutes, it was crazy fast and actually really cool to go through. After the procedure, your sight will be fuzzy but this is normal. But the next day, I was able to see perfectly clearly.

Today, I have pilot vision and couldn't imagine going back. This especially helps since I'm on the computer a lot.<//review>

Dr Pham and his team are top notch, and my only regret is not having LASIK done a whole lot sooner! The staff is incredibly knowledgeable and professional, and every question or concern I had was thoroughly addressed throughout the process. I'm five days out from my LASIK procedure, and my vision is better than 20/10 and my eyes feel perfect. The procedure itself was no big deal, and Dr. Pham is definitely a master at his craft. I'm so grateful to be able to see, and I wholeheartedly recommend this team!</text>

Great experience with Dr Pham and his office staff. Everyone was so friendly from the get go, very responsive and made me feel comfortable. I was very impressed by the fact Dr Pham called me the night of my surgery to check in. I know I chose the right option for LASIK and highly recommend San Diego LASIK Institute if you want new eyes!</Text>

After years of frustration with contacts I decided I wanted lasik done. A simple google search will pop up many businesses and with similar pitches and guarantees. After a couple of consults at various businesses, it was an easy decision to go with Dr. Pham and his team. The whole experience was smooth and easy and the surgery is really pain free. I am now two weeks out from the surgery and Lasik with Dr. Pham has really changed my life. No more waking up or going to sleep with poor vision. No more worry of taking off and putting on contacts and no more headaches from glasses. If you are considering Lasik even a bit I would definitely recommend going into Dr. Pham's office for a consultation.</Text>

It honestly feels like a miracle!  I can see for the first time in 20 years without glasses or contacts!  I've wanted Lasik for years, but  I figured I'd wait until, "the procedure had been perfected."  Really I was afraid to have it done, and my contacts were working okay.  Then, at 40, my eyes became more dry and I couldn't wear contacts for more than 3 hours without them giving me a headache.  I'm an active person with an active family and glasses weren't working.
A friend recently had her eyes done by Dr. Pham and was very happy with the whole experience, so I took the plunge.  Dr. Darrow and the rest of the staff are very affable and easy to work with. I was put at ease by their care, checking and double checking of my eyes before the procedure.  On the day of the surgery, when I met Dr. Pham, I was TERR-I-FIED, even with the meds they gave me.  He offered to reschedule if I preferred (and with so much grace) but, in the end he helped me calm down with some relaxation coaching.
The procedure was painless and fast (even though I was scared) and, although they told me to keep my eyes closed, when I peaked, I could see everything.  When I woke the next day I felt like the world was new.
Now, two weeks later, I am still pinching myself when I don't need to reach for my glasses in the morning or when I wonder at an amazing San Diego sunset that is so much more vibrant when not seen through the lenses of glasses.
Seriously amazing!  Worth every penny.</review>

I didn't really think I would get LASIK, but after wearing glasses for over 20 years and my sight not getting any better I decided to move forward with it since technology hasn't caught up to make a thin lens for -6.75 equivalent to -1.50.

Two of my colleagues and a waitress that overheard me talking about it all went to Dr. Pham and have had the best results. This is the first surgery of my life, so it's go with the best or nothing at all. After reading all the reviews here, going in for the consultation and being the perfect candidate for it I was convinced.

I got LASIK 2 weeks ago and it's amazing to see everything clearly now and not have to fuss with glasses! My face feels free and not hidden behind frames anymore. The surgery is painless and quick, and as long as you follow the instructions post-op you should be good to go. I went to sleep for the whole day and was at work the next day. This was one of the best decisions I ever made and the entire staff is spectacular! If you're going to get LASIK, go here and nowhere else - you won't regret it!<//text>

I was always hesitant to perform LASIK and was about to rely on contacts and glasses for my entire life. It wasn’t until my friend recommended Dr. Pham since he had procedure done a year ago. This has been the best decision of my life.

I was extremely excited the day of surgery. The office has a variety of snacks in almost every room. Everyone was extremely polite, welcoming, and nice. Teresa especially was very welcoming and went through all of the day of surgery information and post OP information. She was very patient and extremely detailed with everything. She deserves an employee of the year award for everything she's done for me.

The results were amazing. I am able to wake up and see everything. It’s a dream come true and I haven’t remembered this day in my entire life. Dr. Tony Pham performed a painless procedure. To this day I have not suffered from dry eyes or any halos at night.

I am recommending this place to all of my family and friends in the future. Thank you for changing my life Dr. Pham, Dr. Darrow, and Teresa.<//review>

I was referred to Dr. Tony Pham by two of my co-workers who had LASIK performed by him – and in both instances, they were beyond satisfied with the results of their surgery.  With their encouragement and positive feedback, I was comfortable with pursuing the procedure at the San Diego LASIK Institute.

I was immediately impressed by the staff’s professionalism and attention to detail; at every step of the way, they made sure I was comfortable, and patiently answered all of my questions and concerns. Post-op care was meticulously and thoroughly explained.  As for the surgery itself, it was a complete success, and I now have 20/15 vision.  The day after the surgery when I drove in for my follow-up, I couldn’t believe how clear my vision was!  Best of all, it has only gotten better in the weeks following – my vision is essentially perfect 4 weeks out.

Rest assured, you won’t go wrong by having Dr. Pham as your surgeon. This was a worthy investment, and I wouldn’t hesitate at all in referring anyone.  My only advice is try and have the surgery performed in the later part of the day so it’s easier to sleep after the procedure, or just skimp on the previous night’s sleep.< /review>

<Review>I just got my LASIK surgery at San Diego LASIK Institute! I have made one of the smartest investment of my life. The amazing staff, Victoria, Dr. Darrow and Dr. Pham made the whole experience from start to finish amazing. The staff walked me through every step of the way and made me feel comfortable and most importantly informed me with the right expectations. I had my surgery yesterday and I woke up today with 20/20 vision! I feel more confident in tackling life! I highly recommend getting your eyes done if you have been thinking about it or at least  coming in for a free consultation to see if it is right for you.

I would highly recommend this center for lasik! I was really hesitant at first and honestly the thought of getting lasik terrified me but after meeting with the super welcoming friendly staff my fears were put at ease. They made the process quick and simple and kept me well informed of everything that was going on. I'm most definitely going to recommend Dr. Pham and the rest of the team to anyone I know that wishes to persue getting the procedure done!
I have nothing but good things to say about the entire experience, and now I am glasses free!</text>

My free consultation was ok. They told me about the whole procedure. Knowledgable with every question I asked them. On the day of the surgery everybody was asking me how was I doing and I told them I was nervous. They consoled me saying it will be ok. Dr. Pham was extremely friendly. Praising me the whole time. Pretty pricey so I recommend taking those complimentary waters and snacks. Overall my vision is great. I had a very large prescription with almost Coke bottle lenses and with this surgery I can see great. With twenty plus years of wearing glasses and contacts to now wearing nothing is so surreal. I'm just like many others " I should have done it sooner. " So I will end it with this just think about it and get a free consultation.< /text>

<Review>Can't say enough good things about The San Diego LASIK Institute. My wife had her PRK surgery done here. The whole staff was awesome from start to finish. They were very flexible with our busy schedules. They made my wife feel really comfortable and at ease with the whole process.

I had LASIK done last Thursday by Dr. Pham & have had 20/20 vision since I woke up the following day! It has been one week & have had no issues or problems. The San Diego Lasik Institute is in a great location, it's very clean, & the staff are all very professional and will answer to all your questions. From the two pre-op appointments, to the financing of the procedure, the procedure itself, and the follow-up appointments, everything ran smooth & I felt in good hands the entire time. I have been, and will continue to recommend Dr. Pham & his crew at the SD Lasik Institute to my friends & family! This is something I should have done for myself years ago!<//Text>

I do not know where to start about SD Lasik Institute. From the very beginning (my consultation) they have always been so welcoming and it has always been about my vision & concerns. I never felt pressured to do anything, they always made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I expressed my nervousness from the start and they always did their best to make each visit as easy and stress free as possible. April, the receptionist, has always been so helpful, I'm not sure how many times I called to change appointment times but she was always so happy to do so. Dr. Darrow is always a delight to see at all my follow ups. Dr. Pham knows what he's doing and I had 100% faith in him. And Victoria was so helpful with the financial aspect of the process as well! 6 months later, I'm still seeing 20/15!! (My contact prescription was almost a -6.0 before I got the procedure. My husband would have to look for my glasses for me cause I couldnt see clearly even if my glasses were within a couple arm's reach. Yea, it was pretty bad.) I honestly couldn't be happier with not only getting the procedure done but choosing San Diego LASIK Institute to do it!!! Thank you to everyone there && it is definitely the place I recommend for LASIK!!!<//Text>

<gmapID>0x80d9551a0fb3fb53:0xe3edc58685042e30< /gmapID><review>Absolutely fantastic experience with Dr. Pham and his team at SDLI!  Everyone I've come in contact with at their office is extremely friendly, helpful, and knowledgable.  The full battery of tests using the latest state-of-the-art equipment during the consultation screening was thorough and the "measure thrice, cut once" approach assured me that I was being treated as an individual patient and not just another set of eye balls.  Dr. Pham and his entire team go above and beyond to establish a long-term relationship with their clients to ensure success; this isn't a one-time treatment kind of thing.

Everyone on Dr. Pham's team did an outstanding job explaining every aspect of the surgery:  the screening procedure, the equipment used, pre-, during, and post-op expectations, payment options, etc. all without ever pressuring me into a decision.  The SDLI team doesn't need to be gimmicky to attract clients; the fact that it's a top-notch organization is obvious from the moment you walk into their office.

The surgery itself was straight forward and exactly as described.  Dr. Pham himself even followed up that evening with a phone call, which I blissfully slept through before waking up the next morning with zero discomfort and not having to reach for a pair of glasses for the first time in 18 years.  Two of the best decisions I've ever made are deciding to get LASIK and going with Dr. Pham and SDLI!</review>< Response>

<Time>1466022444318< /Time><Text>My experience at San Diego LASIK Institute was truly first class and top notch, from beginning to end.  Their office is very clean and professional, with April O'Neil providing snacks and refreshments upon entering.  I initially met with Richard Bloom, who walked me through some tests to ensure I am a good candidate and then watched a 24 minute video which provided some background information about LASIK.  I decided to proceed and booked my second consultation, where I met Dr. Darrow who performed a more thorough test/mapped my eyes.   Dr. Darrow and Richard were able to answer most of my questions, but me being the extremely particular engineer that I am, I insisted scheduling a third consultation so that I could meet the man himself.  The one who would transform my life forever.  And by forever, I mean the last 8 months.

I met with Dr. Pham and brought with me a stack of articles from scientific/health journals, papers, and studies.  I was doing tons of research, reading papers comparing results between Dr. Pham's equipment (both flap maker and actual correcting laser) and other LASIK surgeons' equipment within San Diego.  For everyone's information, the results are nearly negligible, with regards to longevity of results and corrective quality in higher order aberrations, etc.  Dr. Pham spent a significant amount of time from his busy schedule to talk everything over with me, answering all the questions and concerns I had from my research.  In the end, with the equipment being nearly negligible between other LASIK centers, it came down to the surgeon.  I felt very comfortable with Dr. Pham.  Not only was he very compassionate and knowledgeable in his craft, but he is a perfectionist (like me).  And someone I am handing over my sight to, I wanted him to be just that.  (By the way I did see another very popular LASIK center in San Diego.  This wasn't the only one I went to but it was the one I ended up with (clearly))

For those wondering, my personal experience was great.  I didn't feel any discomfort during the surgery, just minor pressure (but not an uncomfortable amount) during the actual surgery.  After I was done, I was able to read the clock on the wall inside of the operating room.  I was SO EXCITED but I wanted to limit the amount my eyes were open since I wanted to ensure a perfect recovery.  So I sealed them shut for the next 10 hours.  I went home that day, went to bed, and woke up at nighttime with 20/20 vision (confirmed the next day).  When I woke up at night, I DID notice halos when staring at the lampposts in my neighborhood.  Those were the only NEW things I noticed.  I noticed starbursts as well but I always noticed those pre-surgery.  Nothing else was noted during nighttime and during daytime, it was crystal clear, no symptoms then.  The following week during my follow-up, my vision improved to 20/15.  A couple months later, the halos were gone.  Since then, I have had absolutely NO symptoms, nighttime OR daytime.  I would recommend being extremely strict on yourself during recovery post surgery.  Use lubricating drops like they are free.  They are cheap enough and your recovery and future symptom-free eyes depend on your discipline.  I think that helped speed my recovery.  I never actually felt dry eyes but I would just use them like crazy anyway.  Why not? I already paid for them ($20 at costco).  If you have any questions on my personal recovery, ask Dr. Darrow.  She knows all about my recovery (Hi Friend!).

I have since recommended multiple friends and coworkers to Dr. Pham and the staff at San Diego LASIK Institute (Hi April!).  My experience couldn't have been any better.  Thank you Dr. Pham and everyone (April) for a pleasant experience.  If anyone has any questions or concerns prior to their surgery or meeting with Dr. Pham, feel free to contact me.  I love helping people out.  Because I am a good person/philanthropist.

Oh also, this message is to Dr. Pham and the San Diego LASIK Institute.  The ONLY thing that I would recommend you guys work on is your WEBSITE.  Out of space, see yelp!<//Text>< resp>

Just had my LASIK procedure yesterday and had the most amazing experience! Dr. Pham is a very patient surgeon and strives for 100% accuracy in completing the procedure. Dr. Pham is caring and warm and makes sure that you are feeling comfortable at all times. Everyone in the office makes you feel at ease and is available to answer all of your questions. I am so glad I decided to go through with LASIK at the San Diego LASIK Institute. I will definitely be recommending Dr. Pham to anyone who is considering LASIK in the future. Thank you Dr. Pham!!!< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Definitely money well spent. I couldn't be happier with the results of my LASIK procedure. And the staff at Dr. Pham's office are amazing.

From my initial consultation to my follow-up appointments, these guys really took care of me. It was incredibly easy to schedule the initial consultation. It's a very inviting, no-pressure environment where they show you a video, talk about the day of surgery, and check your eyes to make sure you are a candidate for surgery. Richard, the business manager, does a great job outlining how the process works, the pricing, payment options, and what to expect the day of the procedure.

Dr. Darrow, the optometrist, is a sweetheart. She's got a great disposition and does a good job explaining what to expect after surgery and the vision changes you'll encounter.

Finally, Dr. Pham. He's excellent at what he does and really knows how to get his patients to relax. On the day of surgery, my pupils weren't dilating as quickly as they normally do, even after dilating drops, so Dr. Pham had me hum a song and voila! Dilation. Within minutes the procedure was done and I could already see a difference in my vision.

The entire process from my initial visit to surgery day was about 7-10 days as they want you to be out of your contacts for 7-10 days. I scheduled my procedure on a Friday so that I could go home and just knock out afterwards without  worrying about having to work during the day of recovery. They give you a Xanax half an hour prior to the procedure and let you rest up in a room, then send you home with a Valium for pain relief. I had no issues with pain and no issues with dryness afterwards.

And the cherry atop great results and outstanding customer service? Otis Spunkmeyer cookies and all the great snacks they've got in the lobby and the little viewing area for the videos. ^_^</text>< pictures>

I'll start by saying I had THE BEST experience at the San Diego LASIK Institute. Their entire staff was very knowledgeable, professional, and friendly - they really helped to dissipate all of my initial fears about undergoing LASIK.

Dr. Pham performed the procedure; he was clearly very comfortable within his craft, helped to keep me calm throughout the procedure, and communicated during every step. For me, this was a big deal because the morning-of some of my nervousness resurfaced. I truly appreciated every bit of attention to detail the staff provided with every visit (from consult to procedure day to follow ups). For my pre-procedure visits and all of my follow-ups I've had the pleasure of working with Dr. Darrow - and she is amazing. Like the others, she's deeply knowledgeable and is such a sweet and delightful person. I know, being so nice is not requirement for getting the job done correctly, but very much appreciated!

It's been about 6 weeks since I had my LASIK and I have zero regrets. My vision was HORRIBLE before is found them and and my vision is now 20/15! Everything is crisp and clear, something that I suppose most people take for granted but I didn't realize until now how much I was missing. Quality all around.

If you're wondering where to go, this is the place. I was referred by a friend but still in my skepticism did tons of research, which led me right back here. Sending much love and HUGE THANK YOUs to SD LASIK Institute!</text>

I first came to San Diego Lasik Institute and Dr. Pham after a coworker had his procedure done with them and gave a good review. When I knew I was finally ready to get the procedure done, I set up 4 consultations around San Diego. I had one with NVision and one with SD Lasik Institute.  After both of those, I had a much better feeling about SD Lasik Institute than NVision and decided to cancel my other consultations and set up my surgery with Dr. Pham.

The consultation was great and everyone there is very nice. As most other reviews note, there are snacks everywhere so if you come hungry, you won't be disappointed.  I had a second appointment  with Dr. Darrow (their optometrist) to check my eyes again since I had been wearing Toric lenses (have to be out of Toric  for 2 weeks leading up to surgery FYI!!) so they wanted to double check my eyes again. Scheduling the surgery was easy and the payment plan and cost are pretty much the same as other places in the area.

On the day of surgery, they give you a Xanax to chill out and check your eyes again before surgery. The surgery was way easier and faster than I thought it would be. There is slight discomfort when they make the flap - more of pressure/discomfort - but no pain whatsoever. Dr. Pham is great and talks you through the whole thing and tells you exactly what he's doing, what you will feel, and how long each step will last. The entire surgery was about 5 minutes long for me. When I got up off the chair, I could see! Everything was completely clear as if I were wearing my contacts. They give you a couple valium, eye drops, and tell you to go home and sleep (pretty easy after 2 valium).

I'm now 2 weeks past my surgery and LOVING the new vision. I haven't had much dry-eye or other noticeable complications. My eyes were fairly uncomfortable for about 6 hours after the surgery but after that, I was good to go.  The day after surgery I was seeing 20/15 which is great!! I'm about to go in for my two-week appointment and am feeling good about my vision so far.

This has been one of the best decisions and investments I've ever made and would highly recommend San Diego Lasik Institute and Dr. Pham!!</text>

<Text>Having to wear glasses for over 15 years, the dream of one day not needing them was always a surreal idea. When I decided enough was enough and I was ready to take the plunge I did tons of research to get the best lasik I could, my eyes aren't something I wanted to jeopardize. I found Dr Phams information and called in. I reached a rep who answered all of the questions I had and walked me through the process. I was nervous/excited for my consultation visit. I was a good candidate and they explained the technology they use for the surgery. An opening for surgery was 2 days later which was exciting! I was very nervous the day of, but the staff and Dr Pham made me feel at ease. the surgery was an experience I will never forget but it was not bad. just keep staring at the laser!! after maybe 8min it was over and I went home and straight to bed. the next morning was unbelievable. I went in for my check up that day and had 20/20 vision!  I was lucky, there were no side effects I have experienced and me eyes are healing perfect. lasik was one of the best things I have ever done and I would recommend dr Pham and his office because they are professional, serious about what they do and they know they are the best!  thank you Dr Pham!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I had my eyes done at san diego lasik institute and I am very happy with the results. First let me start off by saying that the office is top notch. Every one had so much patience and really did their best to answer all of my questions no matter how many different ways I asked them. Dr. Phan was very comforting and made the experience very easy to go through.

As for my eyes, and if your questioning whether to do it or not. Do it. The healing process took me about a month, and I can already see just aswell as before when I had glasses. I was so nervous about the surgery but now I know how easy it is and would recomend it to any one looking at getting this surgery done. Especially at san diego lasik institute, you can rest assured that you will be in good hands.< /Review>

Everyone in the office was very warm and friendly and clearly passionate about their work! I was filled in on every step of the LASIK process and went into surgery feeling extremely comfortable. Dr. Pham was amazing helping me through the actual procedure and I always looked forward to being cared for by Dr. Darrow at each follow up!

<Review>I just had my follow-up appointment after my Lasik surgery, Guess what? I CAN SEE! (20/15). Dr. Pham, Dr. Darrow, and the wonderful team at San Diego Lasik Institute were all friendly and took great care of me during the entire process. On your first appointment, they see if you are a candidate for Lasik. You go through several easy test and exams. You then meet with Victoria to go over payment options and logistics. (easy conversation, no pressure to make a decision). Second appointment is to dilate your eyes, more exams, and have you sign lots of papers and pick a date for surgery. I was ready to run out of the door after hearing and reading about all the possible things that could go wrong. But don't worry; Dr. Darrow saves the day by answering all your many questions, and reassuring you that Dr. Pham uses the top of the line technology and your precious eyes will be fine. :)

I knew when I first walked into the facility that I was going to love this place because they have all my favorite snacks. Not only are snacks in the reception area, but in almost every room I went into had snacks and water. The way to my heart is a soft cookie, and they had a tray full of soft chocolate and M&M cookies. I probably ate more than I should have. OK I digressed.

Day of Surgery Dr. Pham and the team walk you through every step of the process in full detail. I didn't feel nervous at all. And felt no pain during the surgery. Dr. Pham is a very meticulous in his craft which makes you feel like your eyes are in the best hands possible. If you're looking to get Lasik, look no further than Dr. Pham and SD Lasik Institute, they use the top of the line equipment and they truly treat you like family.</Review>< Pics>

After checking out four different lasik clinics, I decided to trust San Diego Lasik Institute with my eyes. Dr Pham didn't disappoint! I have stable 20/15 six months later and I couldn't be more happy with my vision. Everyone in the office is friendly and professional. Dr Pham gave me his personal cell and told me to call if I had any issues at all. This came in handy when I misplaced some of my post-op antibiotics. Dr Pham wrote me a prescription and called it in on a Saturday for me. Awesome! They're also very competetively priced with the other San Diego clinics I looked at. Not the absolute cheapest,  but bottom basement price wasn't my main priority when making this decision - they're my eyes after all!< /Text>

Stop looking--you've found the best place to get Laser Eye surgery in San Diego! My experience here has been top notch since the moment I first walked through the door for my free consultation. The front desk staff and Victoria made me feel very comfortable during my check-in and initial screening tests. Everyone who works there is extremely friendly (and in my opinion, good looking which doesn't hurt haha!). And the doctors are straight up PHENOMENAL.

I was referred to NVISION in La Jolla by my optometrist, but I definitely wanted to get at least couple consultations done and do a lot of research. I wasn't able to get a consultation appointment with them for about a month, so I decided to schedule another appointment at SD Lasik Institute as well and got in much quicker. My corneal scans showed some irregularities so Drs. Pham and Darrow recommended I come back a week later after being out of contacts. They determined that I was not a candidate for LASIK but that Dr. Pham would be completely comfortable doing PRK on me. Obviously, that wasn't the news I hoped for because the recovery is much more difficult with PRK.

After going to my second opinion at NVISION, I was told that I was a candidate for LASIK but I got a very weird vibe from that office for multiple reasons. I left that appointment confused--PRK or LASIK?!--so I emailed SD Lasik Institute wanting some clarification about PRK and Dr. Pham called me personally within a couple hours to discuss all my questions in depth! I was so impressed. I still got a third opinion at another place, but ultimately am so thankful I went with my gut instinct and scheduled my surgery with SD LASIK Institute.

Fast forward to surgery day. Dr. Pham made me get dozens of scans of my eyes to send the laser machine--Richard told me that most offices only require 5. Translation: Dr. Pham is extremely thorough and careful. Don't know about you, but that's exactly what I wanted in my eye surgeon haha! During surgery, though I was extremely out of it thanks to the lovely Xanax they gave me, Dr. Pham explained everything as he went. Though I trusted Dr. Pham in my gut before going into surgery, I KNEW I made the right decision when he explained how much corneal scarring I had on my right eye. He went above and beyond to give me a perfect eyeball and said if I had gotten LASIK, the flap would have most likely come off due to the scarring (YIKES!!!).

It has been 2 weeks since surgery and I am feeling great! I still have some discomfort, my vision is continuing to get better and better, and am just extremely overjoyed that I got PRK. I just talked to Dr. Darrow this morning less than 15 minutes after leaving a voicemail.  She's so wonderful and patient.

Lastly, THE SNACKS IN THE OFFICE ARE LEGIT AND AMAZING.  Minor plus :)</text>

<review>It is very difficult to rate a Lasik doctor because unlike a restaurant one does not really have the option to “try” different services. So I understand why someone might be skeptical of online reviews when picking a doctor. The ratings you see here are real and Dr. Pham is meticulous with his work and his staff is well aware as to how high his expectations are of them. I am very happy with the results and the way I was treated throughout the entire process.

By this afternoon I will be 48 hours post lasik surgery with Dr. Pham and I could not be happier with the life changing results! I had been toying with the idea for years and decided that having just recently turned 30 I would settle for glasses / contacts for the rest of my life or take some money out of savings and ride myself of the hassle; it has been money very well spent. Dr. Pham runs his practice in an interesting fashion in that most of the time you do not meet him until the day of the surgery. This was red flag for me AT FIRST but since he came recommend by a friend I stuck with it and his staff was very helpful with everything leading up. Day off could not have gone better and I now understand why Dr. Pham does not meet his patients prior, he is focused. I have very nervous the moments before, noticing this, he gently massaged my temples to get me to relax prior to starting. Once he began EVERY step was spoken out loud to me so I was well aware of every little detail that was going on. At the end I sat up and was able to look at a clock for the first time in 18 years without corrective lenses.< /review><Gmap_id>0x80d9551a0fb3fb53:0xe3edc58685042e30<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Like most things, I found the San Diego Lasik Institute off Yelp and read ALL of the reviews before I scheduled my appointment. I wanted to get LASIK done before starting grad school in the fall but was very worried about something going wrong.
Dr. Tony Pham and his lovely staff made the entire process a breeze despite my nervousness the whole time. Optometrist, Dr. Darrow was so charming. She addressed each of concerns and sincerely eased my fears. Not once did I feel pressured by anyone in the office to have the surgery done. On the day of the surgery I was very nervous, so much so that not even the Xanax I was given was working. Dr. Pham calmed me down by massaging my temples to help me relax. And just like that I was relaxed and in what felt like 2 minutes the procedure was done. the next day I woke up with clear vision. After over 10 years of having poor vision, waking up and being able to see everything was amazing.

I am 2 months post-op and I have PERFECT vision!!!
My quality of life has definitely improved. Now I can drive, workout at the gym, and watch TV, all without the use of my glasses.

I would without a doubt refer anyone I know to Dr. Pham at the San Diego LASIK Institute. This was hands down the best thing I have ever invested in.<//review>

<review>I was refer to Dr. Pham by my best friend.  I just had my surgery done last week and I'm thrilled to have chosen the surgical procedure at Dr. Pham's office.  The entire staff was professional, friendly, and most of all, they treat you as if you are a member of their family.  I wore my success t-shirt the next day after for my follow up.  Dr. Pham said I treat your vision and I treat you like I would treat my brother and I feel his sincerity.  I trust my vision with Dr. Pham and his staff.

Found them on Yelp with nice reviews for lasik surgery but i needed Catarac surgery when i called them they said that they performed that surgery and so i scheduled an appt at there misson valley location once getting there and paying for my consultation it was then i was informed that the surgeon who peformed the catarac surgery was brian le and was a sub contracted doctor who did not work for them so i would need to pay them but the surgery would be performed in ranch bernado at Dr Le's location so i had to go out to rancho bernado to get my second consultation with a serperate company not affliated with San Diego lasik as they charged me as well, then when it came down to scheduling the surgery i then had to go back to san Diego lasik to make my payment basically San Diego Lasik played middle man and lied to me about them performing my Catarac surgey they just wanted a piece of the pie instead of being honest with me, after surgey was over they wanted me to go back to mission valeey for my post op which i did and Dr Brian Le did not show up so i never received my post opt appt and was also billed by the surgey center for over 600.00 dollars when the price i paid included all services once calling San Diego Lasik to inquire about this billing matter there gal APRIL told me that they have nothing to do with any of Brian Le's surgerys and would not help me on bit but they were the one's you took the money in cash upfront very dishonest and misleading company just try to stick there 2 cents in to receive a kickback and when i went to get my left eye done i decided to go direct to the main doctor well April caught wind of this and started bad mouthing me to the surgery center which has not caused conflict between me and the doctor i will never use a company that lies to you about what there services are !!!!!!!!!!!!!!</review>

One of the BEST and EASIEST decisions I've ever made was to choose Dr. Tony Pham at the San Diego Lasik Institute.

After having had my PRK performed by Dr. Pham in San Diego, I can say with 100% confidence that Dr. Pham was the right choice.  Being able to see in the morning without having to scramble for my glasses or squint to find the light switch is a blessing.  Actually seeing the faces of the people I love without contacts was more than just icing on the cake.  Dr. Pham changed my life!

The decision to have PRK or LASIK surgery done is a big one.  But in my humble opinion, the decision on who to choose as your surgeon is just as big or even bigger.  Dr. Pham is EXPERIENCED, SMART and KIND.  That's exactly what I want in the person I'm trusting with my eyes.  Dr. Pham has been performing eye surgeries successfully for years, and he knows what he's doing.  What distinguishes Dr. Pham from just being another great surgeon is that he genuinely cares about his patients.  He will call you the day of your surgery to make sure you're doing well.  He and his team will constantly follow-up with you to make sure that your vision reaches optimal results.  He really does treat you like family!

Dr. Pham and his team is there for you every step of the way. They are there to answer your questions and make sure that you are very well aware of what you're getting yourself into and how surgery and recovery works.  I am grateful to Dr. Pham and his team.  They're professional, friendly, knowledgeable and just good people.  Everyone is on top of their game at SDLI, and I can see why Dr. Pham would be regarded as the best in the industry.

Like I said, BEST and EASIEST decision I've ever made.  They say hindsight is 20/20... And perhaps literally in my case because of Dr. Pham!< /text>

I waited a little over a week to write the review just to make sure I can still see 20/15! I went to 3 different clinics for a consultation, and had no doubt I wanted Dr. Pham to be my doctor. The major selling point for me was the fact that all the appointments (pre/post) are personally attended by Dr. Pham, who is not only professional and competent, but very warm, friendly and compassionate. I had my 16mo old daughter with me for the first consultation and my 1 week post-op appointment, and all the office staff, especially Dr. Pham who is a father of two, were so inviting and welcoming. Speaking of staff, Shiggy and Richard were amazing. I had to postpone my surgery twice and they were extremely understanding and accommodating. I thought they were just doing sales, but they hold your hands every step of the way - even on your surgery day! That explains why they're so knowledgeable about everything and it's great to have familiar faces/voices right before the surgery. I was a nervous wreck, but they (and xanac) helped calm me down and the surgery was a HUGE success! I felt no pain EVER, and I was seeing 20/15 the very next day! My experience was so wonderful, I want everyone considering LASIK to have the same experience. I wish Dr. Pham was also a dentist. :D</text>

Beyond accommodating when I was going through a super stressful time. JT has been one of the absolute best people I have EVER WORKED WITH and I’m talking about in all areas of customer service period he is at the top! I am so grateful for all of his hard work and professionalism. He took the time to tackle what I thought was an impossible task (I had spent hours and hours phone call after phone call trying to fix this mess I got myself in and was trying to get insured but no one could help me I was agitated and was starting to feel like it was hopeless) but he worked some sort of miracle and I can not thank him enough!!! He showed me care and really made me feel appreciated! my experience with this company has truly been great (And I don’t write many reviews but this one was by far worth my time to give thanks and to show my gratitude) THANKS A MILLION JT!< /text><time>1579812022585< /time>< user_id>

Thank you JT for all your kindness and help. I would recommend anyone and everyone to speak with JT.<//Text>

<text>Really thankful for the help I received today. Spoke with a man named Jt, he made my whole situation at the dmv much easier. I got insured today plus had to un-suspend my car. He took care of the payment for me while I was waiting in line at the dmv. Saved me time. Was not aware I had to pay that first being this is my first time in this situation. So he called back communicating and making sure everything would be set up and good to go by the time I got up to the front of the line. Being at the Dmv is unpleasant enough but having Jr help me out was the highlight of it all. Really sincere about it as well which is a big plus to me as a costumer! Thank you so much! People like him really make the world go round. I know he gets paid for this but it’s refreshing to deal with genuine people over the phone you know. Thanks again.< /text></record>

Called in a week ago to get information on a new policy for my Nissan Sentra. Phone call was answered by Belen who knew the answers to all of my questions. First Insurance office who asks me if they answered all of my questions before disconnecting. Belen definitely deserves a Starbucks if I decide to stop by.</Text>

Sooo JT really made me feel Grateful that I did a google search and choose Aims website, the look was user friendly right from the start and JT got in touch with me super quick, he was very professional even provided me with a quote from my old company under new-ownership ( knowledge found out by speaking with 3 others agents offering higher start-up / mthly payments from the SAME company during my price check HUNT😊) but at a cheaper rate I got all of my coverage at a way cheaper price which is the reason why I let the coverage lapse in the beginning I didnt want to feel robbed but who knew I would end up actually feeling blessed TY........</Review><response>{'time': 1570466554252, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving us such a wonderful review.

Really horrible place don't trust them..  Janet said she couldn't help me because I need to speak to Jennifer the person who made my policy ? I called to see when my insurance bill was due the lady Janet  told me it was due on the 28th . I check my bank acct transactions my money was taken out on the 20th with no knowledge . When I spoke to her again she kept trying to talk over me not even letting me talk . I literally only had insurance for 19 days and after that I was charged for anthor month .  IF YOU DO HAPPEN TO USE THEM DONT LET THEM SIGN YOU UP FOR THE DIRECT DEPOSIT . WHEN THE BILL IS DUE THEY AUTOMATICLLY WILL TAKE IT OUT THEY TELL YOU YOULL RECIVE A CHEPER PRICE ON YOUR INSURANCE THATS HOW THEY GET YOU.< /text>

Had a horrible drive through experience. The wait took forever to begin with, about 15min, and I had to go to work. An older man working the cashier took my card, then started carrying it around from register to other places, and was confused on what to charge. This made me feel very uneasy.. He overcharged my order and the manager had to give me the difference in cash.. I ordered just one burger and I had to wait 10min at the window. I have ALOT of patience but this was horrible and very surprising. How did this man get hired here? He should not be working at all, I felt unsafe and very uncomfortable, and to top it off, I was late for work.. Never coming back here again.. HORRIBLE experience.< /review>

<text>The food was not very good. The lady working the drive thru asked me to park in the front so that she could make the kids meals fresh for my kids, yet my kids fries were stuck together full of oil, I threw most of them away. Their chicken stars were hard, they complained about their food, they normally eat great! Please do better it was definitely a waste of money!<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

1/4/2020. I Just went in and asked nicely would you please make me a yummy fresh burger and they did with a smile. I’m telling you nothing better than a fresh cooked famous star. Sorry to say it’s a rare thing but this trip rocked.

<review>It’s better that the menu boards can be upgraded to monitor based with dynamic menu and meal pictures. Besides, the menu seems to have less items than other stores in Irvine, so is their customer service.< /review>< Pictures>

Their lemonade is bland.  I know they only serve lemonade light on the soda machine but other Carl's location lemonade is more tasteful.  Told the employee about this and they said everything is working fine.  They don't even want to taste it, just shrug me off telling me that there must be something wrong with the machine....and that was 2 weeks ago.  When I'm back this past Wednesday...it's still the same.</text>

I ordered off postmates and the didn't follow any of the instructions and messed up my order but the problem is they burned both my patties to charcoal and they weren't even the bigger patties i paid for. When i called the lady who claimed to be in charge blamed the burgers being burnt on the postmates driver (i dont understand the thinking on that) and then just had attitude<//Review>

<Review>This is my favorite Carl's. The staff is always friendly and receptive. For breakfast, the biscuits and gravy are fabulous. My wife had the breakfast burrito today and it was everything she expected. The place is always clean. Because it's one of the larger Carl's Jr., there's lots of comfortable seating. The drive-thru is fast and efficient. Everything you want in a fast food restaurant.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80dcddafeb150dbd:0x8a086f4af793a63<//gmap_id></record>

Overall experience was good, food was good. Only issue I had on this visit is that repairs were being made to the ceiling and the person doing the repairs failed to place drop cloths on the seating areas as well as the carpet. In my opinion the repair should have been done after hours due to dust particles in the air which were visible. But food was good nonetheless.< /review>

<text>I love Carls Jr. My favorites are gravy and biscuits. They make the best biscuits I have ever eaten. Also the Santa Fe Western chicken sandwich. Which I buy a lot. The only problem I have with them is this, you are paying extra for the Ortega chili and they only give you a little tiny strip. I always have to tell them to give me a larger piece of chili. I got home one day and had 2 little pieces about the size of a quarter. So your places need to be told about this. And no raising the price. Ok? Thank you.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
The service was mediocre to say the least....if you have multiple customers in line, don't just stand there and ignore them for a few minutes. Usually when you get called for your order to go they at least ask if you want any ketchup or sauce...nope.
The food was terrible. Ordered a number 1 (famous star meal)...they put so much mayo and ketchup on the burger that the bun was mushy and falling apart before I even fully unwrapped the burger. They didn't even spread out the toppings. One spot had only onions, one spot had only tomatoes and one spot had only pickles. When they did call my order and I asked for ketchup, he gave me a handful...the only problem was the outside of the packets were covered in a syrup-like sticky substance.
Home of the $6 burger....more like home of the mush patty.
I know it's fast food, so I shouldn't expect much. But I was a paying customer. Regardless of what your job is, good customer service should be important.
Won't be eating at Carl's Jr. anymore.< /Review>

<text>I have stopped here a few times and it seems the burgers (the last few visits) have come to me cold. Cheese not melted and such. Other Carl's Jr the food has come to me warmer if not hot. I'm guessing the food made ahead of time.</text>< pictures>

Sandwich was terrible. I  noted  when I got home that out of the $20.00 I gave them, the only gave back $2.00, which means they charged me $17.00 for my sandwich.</Text>

Not the worst Carl's I've been to. Super empty, eerily quiet. There was only one crack head, so I guess not too bad for this type of place. I had the saddest salad I've ever eaten in my life,  but what do I expect from a Carl's Jr??</review>

Bad Customer service!! We waited in the drive thru line for 10 min & finally got to the speaker phone 1 minute after 10:30 & was told breakfast is not being served anymore. We have 12 very hungry girls at the house from a sleepover & all they wanted was Carl's Jr breakfast & I asked if he can still help me out considering & refused to serve us breakfast 1 minute after. This place is getting worst & worst & no one seems to want to fix the Problem, 18 year residents in Woodbridge & we will not support this Carl's Jr location again. If you serve breakfast burgers all day what would have been the difference.</Text>

<Review>The sand at the volleyball courts actually feels like real sand!! The frolf game is pretty fire as well, overall a solid park. If I were dad over a young family I'd probably take them here to destroy them in frisbee golf, so that's a 5 star rating for me</Review></record>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>This park was awesome!!! I personally really enjoyed the disc golf course and love the pet friendly set-up they have. All people in the park were polite and to their own workout business. They offer a couple of sand volleyball courts, a few tennis courts, as well as basketball courts. They also have a workout play ground with available workout machines that are surrounded by the beautiful park that offers wonderful sets of amenities.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80ea6dd85a109deb:0xac9264f6198a7bec<//gmapID></record>

My kids loved this park. Not overcrowded with people. The toys were different than most parks. A very clean place to enjoy. The mountain view is beautiful as well. The park is a good size enough space to do different activities.<//Review>

Great place for children and adults alike. Gym equipment is also available. The view is marvelous during the spring with green hills and the Sequoia mountains are accessible on bike. Breeds of Phidippus are also present for arachnid enthusiasts.<//Text>

Awesome park ! I didn't even know this park existed until about 3 months ago. They have volleyball nets, 2 tennis courts with fencing around it, 2 basketball halfcourts, a playground, and some playground style workout equipment. The area is pretty big, you can jog or walk around it as well. It's in a pretty good neighborhood. I highly recommend going to this park.< /Text>

The views here are gorgeous! There is no bathroom but it looks like something between an HOA park and a community park.There is a school nearby and lots of housing. It looks like a really beautiful place to live. The playground is unique and very interesting; my kids loved it.</review>

Very clean park. Mostly residents of the community.  Only cons are the shade trees are still small and don't give off much shade yet and obviously no public restrooms  as it is intended to be used by residents only. Kids enjoyed the playground.< /text>

<user_name>Tinesha Dana<//user_name><text>this park is amazing! my nieces and Lil cousin absolutely loved it.  many beautiful spots to take pictures.  basketball court, tennis court, volleyball court, fitness area, playground, bbq pits and plenty of open space.  when we went there was hardly anyone there and I hope it's like that every time I go.<//text></record>

Great park to take the kids to play on the toys.  No bathroom but that keeps it from getting too busy.  Also has basketball, tennis, disc golf, sand volleyball, and exercise equipment.</text>

It's a nice park. But we need bathroom because some homes are too far to a child to hold their bladder to go to the bathroom.<//Text>

This park has just about everything you can think of; tennis courts, basketball courts, playgrounds with overhead shade tents, plentiful open grassy areas, a sand volleyball court, a workout area with simple machines, & even a frisbee golf course.< /review>

I am a student on a very limited budget without dental insurance. I was very lucky to find Smile Design Dental and I went for a routine cleaning appointment. This was my first dentist appointment after 1.5 years. From the moment I walked into the office, everyone was very welcoming. From the front desk, to the hygienist, to Dr. Robin himself, I felt like I was in good hands. They really took the time to do everything right; the hygienist cleaned my teeth very carefully, Dr. Robin spent a lot of time explaining my X-rays, the front desk staff and the person taking X-rays and doing the polishing were very patient and kind. To be honest, this was probably my most pleasant experience going to a dentist. The level of care, empathy and understanding from Dr. Robin’s team are exceptional. Thank you for everything you did. I truly appreciate each of you.<//text>

< review>
Dr. Robin is amazing. He's friendly and easy going and he's awesome at what he does. I've had three implants to date and each one has been great and no pain. He's easy to talk too plus he's a pro wrestling fan which is even better. As someone who was always afraid of the dentist and never had insurance now through my employer i have insurance and was recommended to Dr Robin, that was the best decision I ever made.. He's a great guy and his office staff are amazing as well and not too mention beautiful and friendly. I recommend Dr Robin too anyone it's the best decision you'll make.<//review>

< review>
I have been to many dentists throughout my life and none have even compared to the level of care I receive every time I call/come into Dr. Robin's office. I had a tooth emergency and his amazing front desk staff squeezed me in that day and they were able to fix my problem in no time.

During my root canal, he constantly checked in to make sure I wasn't experiencing any pain and was very communicative of the entire process. He gave me his cell just in case I experienced pain over the weekend (which no dentist/doctor has EVER done before).

In a city where customer service is sometimes forgotten, it's so refreshing to be taken such great care of!</review>

I’ve been going here for years and I love the way they treat me with care. I feel like I’m at home when I’m waiting in my chair because there’s always music playing and a tv available that keeps me entertained. The staff is very friendly and efficient. I’m extremely grateful for this dental office.< /Review>

I've always hated going into the dentist. From the moment I walked in everyone was super nice and I was greeted with smiles. I checked in and waited in the nice big waiting room. There were a couple other people waiting in the waiting room but I was seen in less than 10 minutes. That really helps me because I get anxiety waiting in waiting rooms.

Once I was taken back I met with Dr. Robin and he clearly explained everything that's going on and what he will be doing to help me. Even though this was my first time meeting Dr. Robin I felt at ease quickly. He was very knowledgeable about my oral condition and how to treat it(I've been to 2 other dentists for same issue).

DR. Robin and his team worked quickly and with no pain to me what so ever! He would check on me every couple minutes to make sure I'm ok. It's now been 2 days since and I'm completely pain free!! Recovery time was non existent and my procedure was not a simple one to say the least. THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Could not be happier with my visit and I no longer hate going to the dentist!</text>

<text>My family has been going to Pico La Cienega Dental (aka Smile Design Dental) for about 15 years. I, myself have worked in the dental field as an office manager for a prominent Beverly Hills dentist also for years. Working in the dental field sometimes you become a little more anxious when it’s your turn in the dentist’s chair, because you know all the procedures and how they are done. I’d also like to mention, it’s very hard to find a gentle dentist that is truthful and honest?
Dr. Robin recently took over the practice, and Mirabelle the Office Manager ( who I have know for years) assured me Dr. Robin was honest and gentle, and to set up an appointment. With her recommendation I did, and now my family and I are committed patients of Dr. Robin. He is very gentle to the touch, very sincere and honest not to mention very innovative with new dental techniques and procedures at a very reasonable cost. I have extremely sensitive gums and teeth, so deep cleaning in the past was always a little uncomfortable for me. Since I have been seeing Dr. Robin it has been a wonderful experience,  because he has a special formula numbing mouthwash rinse that is use beforehand. Hands down, my family and I are very happy with Dr. Robin’s dental care. The office assistants and associates are very welcoming and always make us laugh. We love Maribelle the office manager and the very funny and skilled dental assistant Shahov.
A five ***** recommendation!!</text>< pictures>

I am very happy with this dentist. I've been going for over a year. I've always had good teeth but now I have great teeth. I've received many compliments on my teeth since I started here in January of 2019. This dentist fixed many minor imperfections of mine and now my teeth dazzle (or so I am told). Some dentists will recommend unnecessary and painful procedures to make extra money but not this dentist. He's honest and trustworthy and does A grade work and does not try to sell you on stuff you do not need.<//Text>

<Review>Dr. Robin is an absolutely phenomenal dentist. He is smart, friendly and knowledgeable and the staff is wonderful. I came in for an early morning appointment and was taken excellent care of from the moment I stepped in. Dr. Robin makes sure you are comfortable throughout the visit. A great bonus is that they have a standing X-Ray machine that scans your teeth from the outside so they don't have to stick film in your mouth like other dentists do. I highly recommend Dr. Robin and his office.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2b969913aea8b:0xcf81380cea05f0c3< /GmapID><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

<review>Excellent service, Doctor Songhorian is a dentist who listens and is very good at his craft. He removed my 3rd molars, and now I am starting Invisalign with him. Love how the place is so clean, and Xrays only took a couple of minutes. After my experience at this office, I would go nowhere else!</review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2b969913aea8b:0xcf81380cea05f0c3< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

For being my dentist over a decade I just wanted to thanks for the quick, easy and great service with a decent price! He has planted a 3 unit bridge that has been strongly working with absolute no problem over 17 years! That proves how good his work is. Thanks again Dr D.<//review>

<review>Dr. Gharibian has been my dentist for many years. He has done a lot of dental work on my teeth, including two root canals, a bridge, and other work. All of his work has held up beautifully over the years. His work never gives me any problem. I don't even have to think about it.
Also, he is as pain-free as a dentist can be. Even with two root canals, etc. I had only very minor discomfort, a little bit. No actual pain, at all. His technique is excellent.
On top of all this, he is a very nice man, easy to talk to. And also, his prices are very reasonable. I consider him the Supreme among dentists.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rate>5</rate><Review>My first visit to Dr. Robin's office was last month, and I could not be more happy with the results I have now. I had a broken tooth for a while now, and I had been putting off seeing the dentist for months until I couldn't take it anymore. I stopped by on my way driving by, and luckily they were open late enough to see me. He did a root canal right then and there and I have not been in pain since.

I was so satisfied with the results, that I had brought in my mom recently for a consultation. She had not been to the dentist in about 15 years, had ALOT of bad teeth and was very nervous to go in. Dr. Robin was very caring and understanding, and was able to place implants and dentures in only a few visits. Now she is ecstatic with her new teeth and is able to chew into the foods she has missed over the years. He was able to work with her finances, and it also helped that he accepted Carecredit.

If you are looking for a kind, reputable dentist that provides high quality dentalwork, this is the place to go. I plan on definitely recommending him to my family and coworkers!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Another Dentist told me I had 10 cavities and I really wanted another opinion. Dr. Robin explained everything to me from beginning to end, and let me know exactly what  I needed and why I needed it. . He also said that I had a lot fewer cavities than 10 and that some of them are really small. His prices were great and reasonable. I could tell from his work in my mouth that I had found my new dentist. Im getting my Implant placed next week and even tough Im scared I feel I am in great hands.</Text>< Pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I am a student on a very limited budget without dental insurance. I was very lucky to find Smile Design Dental and I went for a routine cleaning appointment. This was my first dentist appointment after 1.5 years. From the moment I walked into the office, everyone was very welcoming. From the front desk, to the hygienist, to Dr. Robin himself, I felt like I was in good hands. They really took the time to do everything right; the hygienist cleaned my teeth very carefully, Dr. Robin spent a lot of time explaining my X-rays, the front desk staff and the person taking X-rays and doing the polishing were very patient and kind. To be honest, this was probably my most pleasant experience going to a dentist. The level of care, empathy and understanding from Dr. Robin’s team are exceptional. Thank you for everything you did. I truly appreciate each of you.< /review><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1625624341575, 'text': 'Thank you Jessica.

Dr. Robin is amazing. He's friendly and easy going and he's awesome at what he does. I've had three implants to date and each one has been great and no pain. He's easy to talk too plus he's a pro wrestling fan which is even better. As someone who was always afraid of the dentist and never had insurance now through my employer i have insurance and was recommended to Dr Robin, that was the best decision I ever made.. He's a great guy and his office staff are amazing as well and not too mention beautiful and friendly. I recommend Dr Robin too anyone it's the best decision you'll make.< /review>

<Review>I have been to many dentists throughout my life and none have even compared to the level of care I receive every time I call/come into Dr. Robin's office. I had a tooth emergency and his amazing front desk staff squeezed me in that day and they were able to fix my problem in no time.

During my root canal, he constantly checked in to make sure I wasn't experiencing any pain and was very communicative of the entire process. He gave me his cell just in case I experienced pain over the weekend (which no dentist/doctor has EVER done before).

In a city where customer service is sometimes forgotten, it's so refreshing to be taken such great care of!< /Review>< rating>

I've always hated going into the dentist. From the moment I walked in everyone was super nice and I was greeted with smiles. I checked in and waited in the nice big waiting room. There were a couple other people waiting in the waiting room but I was seen in less than 10 minutes. That really helps me because I get anxiety waiting in waiting rooms.

Once I was taken back I met with Dr. Robin and he clearly explained everything that's going on and what he will be doing to help me. Even though this was my first time meeting Dr. Robin I felt at ease quickly. He was very knowledgeable about my oral condition and how to treat it(I've been to 2 other dentists for same issue).

DR. Robin and his team worked quickly and with no pain to me what so ever! He would check on me every couple minutes to make sure I'm ok. It's now been 2 days since and I'm completely pain free!! Recovery time was non existent and my procedure was not a simple one to say the least. THANK YOU SO MUCH!! Could not be happier with my visit and I no longer hate going to the dentist!<//text>

My family has been going to Pico La Cienega Dental (aka Smile Design Dental) for about 15 years. I, myself have worked in the dental field as an office manager for a prominent Beverly Hills dentist also for years. Working in the dental field sometimes you become a little more anxious when it’s your turn in the dentist’s chair, because you know all the procedures and how they are done. I’d also like to mention, it’s very hard to find a gentle dentist that is truthful and honest?
Dr. Robin recently took over the practice, and Mirabelle the Office Manager ( who I have know for years) assured me Dr. Robin was honest and gentle, and to set up an appointment. With her recommendation I did, and now my family and I are committed patients of Dr. Robin. He is very gentle to the touch, very sincere and honest not to mention very innovative with new dental techniques and procedures at a very reasonable cost. I have extremely sensitive gums and teeth, so deep cleaning in the past was always a little uncomfortable for me. Since I have been seeing Dr. Robin it has been a wonderful experience,  because he has a special formula numbing mouthwash rinse that is use beforehand. Hands down, my family and I are very happy with Dr. Robin’s dental care. The office assistants and associates are very welcoming and always make us laugh. We love Maribelle the office manager and the very funny and skilled dental assistant Shahov.
A five ***** recommendation!!<//review>

I've received many compliments on my teeth since I started here in January of 2019. This dentist fixed many minor imperfections of mine and now my teeth dazzle (or so I am told).

Dr. Robin is an absolutely phenomenal dentist. He is smart, friendly and knowledgeable and the staff is wonderful. I came in for an early morning appointment and was taken excellent care of from the moment I stepped in. Dr. Robin makes sure you are comfortable throughout the visit. A great bonus is that they have a standing X-Ray machine that scans your teeth from the outside so they don't have to stick film in your mouth like other dentists do. I highly recommend Dr. Robin and his office.</Review>

Dr. Gharibian has been my dentist for many years. He has done a lot of dental work on my teeth, including two root canals, a bridge, and other work. All of his work has held up beautifully over the years. His work never gives me any problem. I don't even have to think about it.
Also, he is as pain-free as a dentist can be. Even with two root canals, etc. I had only very minor discomfort, a little bit. No actual pain, at all. His technique is excellent.
On top of all this, he is a very nice man, easy to talk to. And also, his prices are very reasonable. I consider him the Supreme among dentists.</Text>

I saw Dr. Robin Songhorian for a implant last week and I must say that I loved his chairside manners and explanation of procedures. Prices were very reasonable and the office is new and clean. Procedure took 1 hr and no pain. Im glad I found my new dentist and got my tooth back!<//review>

My first visit to Dr. Robin's office was last month, and I could not be more happy with the results I have now. I had a broken tooth for a while now, and I had been putting off seeing the dentist for months until I couldn't take it anymore. I stopped by on my way driving by, and luckily they were open late enough to see me. He did a root canal right then and there and I have not been in pain since.

I was so satisfied with the results, that I had brought in my mom recently for a consultation. She had not been to the dentist in about 15 years, had ALOT of bad teeth and was very nervous to go in. Dr. Robin was very caring and understanding, and was able to place implants and dentures in only a few visits. Now she is ecstatic with her new teeth and is able to chew into the foods she has missed over the years. He was able to work with her finances, and it also helped that he accepted Carecredit.

If you are looking for a kind, reputable dentist that provides high quality dentalwork, this is the place to go. I plan on definitely recommending him to my family and coworkers!</Text>

Im so glad I found my new Dentist Dr. Robin Songhorian!!. I am very scared of the Dentist so I never went. Another Dentist told me I had 10 cavities and I really wanted another opinion. Dr. Robin explained everything to me from beginning to end, and let me know exactly what  I needed and why I needed it. . He also said that I had a lot fewer cavities than 10 and that some of them are really small. His prices were great and reasonable. I could tell from his work in my mouth that I had found my new dentist. Im getting my Implant placed next week and even tough Im scared I feel I am in great hands.<//text>

I bought a small bottle of Nailtuiques 2. When I got home, I removed it from the box and found it was almost empty! It looked like it had been used and returned. I was shocked. I immediately called the store and the girl assured me I could bring it back to exchange it. When I got there the next day, the manager treated me like a criminal. She said she would not have done the exchange if the girl had not already told me I could. She said she never had this problem. I let her know I have used Nailtuiques for years and never had this problem.
I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK THERE.
I have never been treated like this anywhere else in the world.< /Text>

< review>
the video that went viral is of my friend (who is half black) being accused of stealing by the owner and followed all the way into sephora where he physically assaulted her. then, security finally somewhat got involved and BARELY tried to protect her. my other friend's mother had done a better job then security. he followed them to the parking lot and police showed up, he finally left. THAT'S NOT ALL- the wife of the owner LIED to the police saying they recovered the stolen items. mind you, they never even searched her. she was just harassed.<//review>

Man who works there assaulted a young girl and lied about her stealing and racially profiled her. she did not steal but he continued to chase her out of the store, grab her and violate her. Security had to hold this man back for the girl to be freed. This store is disgusting and racist and apparently tolerates their employees assaulting young girls. Do not shop at or support this business.<//review>

<Review>Always running behind. Make sure you have your day cleared bc if your appointment is at 9 you won’t be seen until about 10 and won’t be done until about 12! They are also always losing paperwork. Can’t wait to get better insurance to get the hell up out of here! Stay FAR FAR AWAY!!< /Review>< pics>

Please don’t go here if your ever owed money you will never get it! My daughter is owed 400 since last March and they always make excuses on the phone as to why they haven’t refunded it. Or the big one is they say we will call you back. It’s been since last March how long do they take to call back !!! I called again today and same excuse is account payable will call you back. Well if they don’t call back in 2 hours I’m done. Corporate it is and better business bureau it is !<//Review>

First I got there and i had already filled out the forms online, showed them and they said they never got it, so that already pushed my time back. Told me they don’t recommend removing my retainer, that was fine and gave me my next option. I was already sitting in a chair then they had me go back to the waiting room after already waiting an hour. I decided not to fix the retainer because it was $600 to glue it down and they told me have a good day. I still had a teeth cleaning appt that they disregarded. Never took my temperature....customer service was terrible, overall sloppy experience.< /review>< pics>

I came in on an emergency visit with a toothache, making an appointment only hours before.  Dr. Marini thoroughly explained the problem, her solution, and what needed to take place before she could remove my wisdom tooth.  My mouth is very small and it was extremely difficult for her instruments to reach my tooth, but she was very gentle and patient, giving me more numbing anesthesia exactly where it needed to go whenever I felt any pain.  Her staff explained very clearly how to stop the bleeding and what I should and shouldn't do throughout the recovery.  In the end, I kept them over an hour past closing time, but had no further bleeding, swelling, or pain and was back to normal life the next day.  My wife and kids had a very different experience having wisdom teeth pulled at another dentist, and I don't think we will try another dentist again.< /Text>

I got four teeth pulled today and the dental assistant was amazing he was a Libra like myself. He walked me through the process and made me comfortable. The surgeon was super funny and sweet. Dasiy helped me understand my benefits and no pressure was applied. Now, I get to have my beautiful smile as directed by my orthodontist.< /review>

I’ve waited months to get my teeth cleaned. The day i finally get to get the service done, the receptionist gave me attitude & made me wait over 15mins before they even called me back. i walked out. i hated how i was greeted & no one wants to wait even longer on something they’ve been waited month on!</Review>

<review>After receiving a referral from Arlanza Family Health Center, I got my wisdom teeth extracted at West Coast Dental of Corona. They have such great staff and dentists! They are very friendly and helpful. The surgery was much more bearable because of the great people who took care of me. I truly recommend going to this clinic, especially if you have an urgent dental situation.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

< Review>
The wait time in  this office is horrible, extremely long.
Appointment was for 2:00 we arrived 15 minutes early it was 2:45 still WAITING!!!!! At this point we canceled and walked out. One of the ladies that works there asking patients info was rude!!
First and Last time.<//Review>

Everyone was very nice and did their Job to the maximum. I wish the dentist was a little more verbal in what she was doing while she was doing it to help walk me through the procedure I needed. She would have definitely made it easier for me to get it done.<//text>

<Review>About 3-4 years ago, I had 3 wisdom teeth removed and it was an absolute nightmare. I wasn’t able to get general anesthesia because my ride home wasn’t present so they gave me laughing gas even after mentioning I had a panic attack last time I was awake during a procedure. Well I had a panic attack with the laughing gas and was crying and shaking uncontrollably. The female oral surgeon (don’t remember her name) sternly told me to stop crying as if I were a 5 year old throwing a tantrum. I wanted to punch her in the face. I kept telling her it hurt but she kept going and told me to stop moving or we would have to reschedule. She finished and I ran out of there crying. So traumatic.</Review>< pics>

Also they charged  her $450 without telling her she had to pay for a procedure they suggested. I feel that was due to poor communication. Dentist offices are a scary place, but this office is probably overbooked with patients due to COVID which makes the experience even scarier because the communication seems so rushed. I would suggest slow down talk to their patients and stop treating every patient like they have medical.< /Text>< response>

<Response>None</Response><Text>Friendly staff, but very dissatisfied with taking them 2.5 hours to do a simple and I mean, a very simple cleaning, it took less than 20 minutes, the rest of the time was just waiting, since they don’t have any Dental Hygienist, the one and only Dentist is the one doing the dental cleaning, she recommended more treatment and when I voiced my concerns her attitude changed. The place was clean and easy to find. This is a new experience for me having to go to a HMO for the first time, is too bad my insurance situation has changed and no longer can keep my own Dentist that I have been going to for more than 10 years...<//Text>< gmap_id>

Extremely professional, helpful, and caring. I was told every step of what was being done as it was happening which is very helpful with my anxiety. The office manager was incredible and helpful as well. She went over all of the options for the work I needed done and let me know what my insurance covered so I had all the information.</Text>

While the dental treatment was good. I had to wait over an hour after my appointment was supposed to be with my brother having to wait another hour ontop of me to get called back. Also had an appointment scheduled BEFORE the place even opened. When I came in as soon as they opened they said to come back later because they had "dental emergencies" yeah no</review>

< review>
West Coast Dental always tries to shove braces down my throat (figuratively that is). I'm not sure what kind of strong sales incentives they have in place but after being asked 3 different times during your appointment by three different people you begin to get suspicious. Visiting the dentist should not be reminiscent of visiting a Car Dealership! I would understand if my teeth looked as bad as the ones you see on British TV but that is not the case, aside from an obscure gap, my teeth are perfectly straight. After speaking to other friends and family about this issue, they too reported similar experiences at other west coast dentals (therefore this may be an all-around West Dental problem). I understand that this alone may not justify a 2 star rating... And so, the other half of my review is concerned with wait times. I intentionally made it for first thing in the morning at 10 am and still was not seen until after 11. Thus, the combination of both things made it so that I walked away from my appointment with a bad taste in my mouth (pun intended)<//review>

Had an amazing experience. Clean office, lovely staff and amazing doctor. I drove 50 minutes to come to this dental office when I have a dental office 5 minutes away from my house and I do not regret it. I will be back again and bring my family. Highly recommended. Thank you West Coast Dental!!</review>

Went in on Tuesday, Feb. 11th as a first-time patient. There was not a warm and friendly welcome; even though I prefer that than a fake “over the top, glad to take your money” first-time intro. I had to wait 52 minutes to be seen, even with an appointment.

The dental assistant who did my x-rays apologized profusely and explained they were very busy. She was very sincere and friendly.  However, I had to remind her not to keep touching the wall each time she would go back and forth between adjusting and operating the machine to touching my mouth.

They were not able to do a thorough examination or cleaning because they didn’t have the time and it was already past closing time. I understood this.

Daisy (billing/finance personnel) came and spoke to me directly while I’m in the dentist’s chair; and said she’d have the estimate of the other recommended services to me by tomorrow (via email) as she need to followup with insurance company etc. I understood this. She confirmed my email address AND telephone number, using NATO’s phonetic alphabet.

The receptionist (Francisco, I believe) was cordial and booked me for Monday of the following week to get the cleaning done.
I did not receive anything the next day from Daisy or WCDoC as promised. I decided to be patient.

I called on Monday, Feb. 17th to cancel and rebook my appointment. I made the receptionist (Victoria, I believe) aware that I have not received or heard anything from Daisy or WCDoC as promised. She said if I’m sure my email address was correct. Told her yes and confirmed it AGAIN. She said she would let Daisy know and Daisy will be in contact.

I called again on the morning of Monday, Feb. 24th to see if there was any availability for me to get the cleaning done on that same day. There were none. I understood that. AGAIN I stated that I haven’t heard from Daisy or received any information from WCDoC about cost or billing. I asked to speak to Daisy and was told that she is not in as yet; but as soon as she gets in Daisy will call me. He (Francisco) again confirmed my email address and phone number.

Today, I called again to reschedule the appointment and was told by Victoria that Daisy is not in yet. She should be there from 11am-7pm, so I look forward to hearing what valid reasons/excuses there are as you why I have not received ANY communiques in ANY format for almost 1 month (exactly THREE weeks) after the promised date. Where’s the checks and balances to ensure effectiveness and efficiency?

As I give them a second chance to claim my business, please stay tuned...<//text>

Had an amazing experience. Clean office, lovely staff and amazing doctor. I drove 50 minutes to come to this dental office when I have a dental office 5 minutes away from my house and I do not regret it. I will be back again and bring my family. Highly recommended.

Friendly staff but communication is horrible. We always have to wait 2 or more hours to be seen with an appointment! My kids are 4 and 6 so this is difficult for them and for me that I have to spend my day just waiting. Our appointment today was 10 am and its 12:30 and we are still waiting.<//Text>

<Text>As soon As I walked in I was greeted with a big smile and checked in right away, the staff was very freindly, attentive and listened to all my concerns. DR. MARINI did a great job on my teeth and also helped me understand what I need to do to maintain them and prevent future problems. The dental assistant JOANNA although from a different office still made me feel comfortable and let me know that she was there to help and she did a great job. DAISY explained the insurance aspect and what was happening going forward. She was very thoughtful and gave me options for payments, She was very polite and understanding, She runs a great office crew. Maritza at the front desk was very polite and answered all my questions about scheduling and availability, she sent me on my way with a smile. I know where Il be going from from now on.

<text>If I could give a Zero or less, that’s what I would have given them. They state that they do custom dentures. They don’t. Immediately they billed my insurance for the full amount “custom dentures my ass” when they told me that I would be coming back for a fitting, they had the permanent dentures sitting there. They looked horrific. My jaw closed so much that I looked like I didn’t even have teeth. Nor did we discuss color or any of the many issues that I had. I should have ran when I asked for a brochure of these “custom dentures “ and they had nothing to show me, I should have ran out the door. The assistant contradicted herself every time I tried to explain the clearly noticeable problems, she would switch her story faster than your head would spin. This office is horrible. They have no business advertising this procedure when they clearly don’t know a damn thing about it! She had me in tears and showed no compassion. I ended up putting the dentures on the dental tray and ran out crying. Never received a call from them to work on fixing the problems. They are packed with triple bookings. It’s a cattle call instead of a dental office. I have called my insurance and gave them a statement as to my experience.and will be refunded my money.</text>< response>

<Text>Unfortunately every time I come here I wait an hour minimum after my appointment. The ortho reschedules all the time and is only there on Thursdays. It wouldn’t be so bad if they didn’t overbook. The staff is friendly at the front desk. It’s not their fault. But as a customer it’s really frustrating. I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone.< /Text>< pictures>

It’s always an hour wait, regardless of the day or time. They always claim they’re running late “today.” They regularly will call and cancel your appointment, therefore delaying the ortho treatment, which apparently it’s a common complaint here.

BTW, the lobby is not well ventilated and hot, especially in flu season.<//Review>

I have been stuck with them since the grand opening!!! I went through about 4 or 5 dentist, and the same number of ortho doctors.. alll the doctors are great, the problems are treatment. I know my braces were taken off too soon, every new orthodontist has different work days, so they NEVER call me to update my appointment.. I guess they assume we don’t work.  I paid off my bill in full.. big mistake.  The COMPANY is not efficient, the workers just go where assigned<//Text>

The staff are very nice and the office is clean and tidy. They clearly leverage volume, though. The waiting room has been very full and my appointments for dentistry and orthodontics are almost always pushed back. I don't feel like my time is respected. I also have to navigate upsell options every time. Just examine and clean my teeth, please. I don't want options that my insurance doesn't cover.< /Review>

This business hired a dentist that ruined 7 of my teeth and I will never get them back. I have been arguing with them for 3 years trying to get my teeth fixed and all they do is give me the runaround from person to person to person and then when they don't know what else to do they just start ignoring your phone calls. my suggestion would be if you love your teeth whatever you do don't go to this dentist.< /Text>

Always great to me and my daughters! I would though recommend in changing the contact number to reflect the actual office number. Did have a hard time getting a hold of the office until I realized I was being directed to a customer service line. Otherwise, you guys are always fabulous!!</text>

< review>
My daughter was scheduled for extraction of her 3rd molar(s) when she was called on the day of her procedure cancelling her appointment as the dentist was sick and was rescheduled for 11:30 am the following day.  She came in just before her appointed time the following day with little to eat as instructed due to anticipated application of an anesthetic.  She was NOT brought in to be seen until 4pm!!! They were completely unapologetic with numerous other patients walking out during this time and neither the manager of the place nor the dentist came out to address this ridiculous delay.  Overbooking of appointments and of the provider is completely unacceptable.  What is the point of making an appointment if you are not going be seen at that time?  Completely ridiculous!  Oh, guess what West Coast Dental, I'm completely embedded in the medical and dental community in Corona being a Medical Provider myself and I'm going to use all the contacts and influence I have to not send any patients/business there.</review>

I was referred here by my regular dentist because I needed a wisdom tooth pulled. The staff here are very friendly and they try to get you in as soon as possible. I did have an appointment at 1130 but arrived earlier to fill out paper work. They didn't see me until 12, so the wait wasn't too long. Very impressed how the procedure took less than 10 minutes. The dentist were very friendly and answered any questions I had. I would definitely recommend this dental office. Had a great experience.< /Text>

Worst management and staff I have seen in a long time. I went into the dentist in extreme pain with what felt like a bone or piece of tooth coming through my gum. They took x-rays and looked in my mouth and said there is nothing there. I went back the next day saw another dentist and he said it was my bone and he scratched at it with his tool. I went home in pain for a few days and got sick and tired of it, so I took it upon myself to dig the "unknown" out and it was a piece of bone or tooth left in there from a tooth that I had pulled a long time ago. Also, the staff was very rude (especially) the male that runs things around there.<//Review>

On two different occasions i have rescheduled an appointment only to have them call me back to confirm (that the appointment i just rescheduled for another time) if i was still able to make it to my original appointment. I waited an hour today only to be told that i need to go back tomorrow because i missed my original appointment at 3 which i rescheduled for 5. No bueno.</review>< pics>

And it has broken twice in the month she has had it. I told them my last dentist used a 3d printer in office to create my crown and filling, and he tried to tell me that didn't happen. Like it was magic. My "cleaning consisted of polishing my teeth. I could have done that myself. Billing is all sorts of messed up with them billing me instead of my wife and vice versa.

<Review>Worst experience ever!!!  First off, if you need anything more than a routine cleaning expect to reschedule for one of their off site "specialists".  My wife had returned expecting to have work done when she was told that they weren't qualified to perform the work.  They recommended that we go to Kaiser to have the dental work completed.  The "specialist" then proceeded to tell my wife that after the surgery she would probably drool for the rest of her life.  As if this wasn't bad enough, one of the nurses bent over to pick up some supplies and one of the doctors slapped her on the butt.  Everyone started laughing.  Right after my wife was told she had a very serious condition.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcb87359b1ddc3:0x745456f5b0aae0a0<//Gmap_id><Date>1462394727354< /Date><resp>None< /resp><name>Richard Collins<//name></record></dataset><record>

Seeking cash only not willing to even try approval with ins. As well does not do basic cleaning when you go for your check  with even plaque build up, they just want you to pay $800 cash for a cleaning & refuses to do the one ins. covers.  New dentist now & place has gone down . Update, dumb dentist put filling in wrong new dentist said & the other filling fail out in the other. Be careful!<//text>

I finally gave in to my HORRIBLE FEAR of the dentist due to a cracked tooth and PAIN! So I went to West Coast Dental and EVERYTHING they promise is true and more!! They were so friendly and helpful filling out paperwork. Then they were so patient with my fear. Dr. Peterson explained everthing he was doing and waited for me to be ready. Meagan, Dental Hygienist, was gental and patient. After letting my teeth get painful because of fear, I have found the dentist office and Dentist that will make my smile bright again wihout any fear. I can't wait to finish my dental work and look good again!!!

I get there to my appointment 1050 minutes early and they couldn't see him they should have more dinners in there one for the emergencies and the other one to take care of patient I think it wasn't fair to see next time I'll choose another dentist I'm going to look for another test I can take care of me as soon as I can thank you for your cooperation< /review>

We try our best to ensure that these types of occurrences do not happen regularly, but as is the nature of the business, sometimes we run a little bit behind.

Edit: wow looks like I’m not the only one with the same complaint. Owners cutting corners in an extreme way. You know it’s bad when the owner is the cashier! Probably won’t see them there for very long.< /Review><Rate>1</Rate>< resp>

Cute family owned and local cafe. Perfect for breakfast or lunch. Fast and Friendly service. We really enjoyed their coffee and chai, as well as their baked scones. But my personal favorite is their breakfast sandwich with eggs and sausage. Plenty of food for the money. You will also find their menu has an asian flair to it, plenty of asian style salads and main dishes. But if thats not your style they also serve classic american fare.<//Review>

<Review>Where do I begin! Living in Auburn, CA for over 27 years and visited the original owner and location many times. Service, quality, consistently and value were stellar. Several years ago, La Bou changed location and owners; it has been downhill ever since! They were known for their croissants. So many to choose from, but my favorites were the chocolate and the ham & cheese. The croissants were flaky, buttery, large, soft with crisp edges and oh so fresh. I can literally taste it from my memories, however, this is no longer the case. Now, they are missing about half the butter it takes to make fresh croissant dough, the meat is two thin pieces that only fill 25 percent of a corner, and the Swiss is about half a slice. The dough is bread-like, not flaky and it is so dry. The crust was the only sign that butter had ever touched that croissant. Their prices have increased, portions and quality decreased and it resembles nothing like the original locations you find elsewhere. They clearly care more about padding their pockets as much as possible while sacrificing taste and quality at the customer's expense. I honestly have no idea how they are still in business. My review comes after giving them over half a dozen chances over the course of 3 years. It simply doesn't matter who is working, or managing or baking. I have yet to find a good local bakery who does it even close to the original La Bou owners. Save your money and head down the hill to another La Bou or another bakery. It will be worth the trip.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809b1ab3ad8a557f:0x2da7a95d7938e7ba</gmap_id></record>

First they didn't even have the regular croissant which is what they are known for and should have it at all times, they gave me wheat instead! Turkey meat was less than 1 piece, bread for the soup was stale, and customer service was awful, not a thank you or have a nice day!  Probably better cause I probably would say something like, your sandwich is pathetic!!!!</review><rate>1<//rate>< date>

Have always loved Labou, but today sucked.  Creamy dill dressing was sour tasting, almost like they put vinegar in it. They said the recipe hasnt changed, and its all the same batch. They did offer another salad, but I go for the dill dressing. The ambiance is very cafeteria like the way they have the tables set up. I'm moving soon,  so this was most likely my last Labou lunch. Bummer.<//Text>

My salami sandwich had 4 slices of salami. My husband opened his tuna sandwich and it was 1 scoop of tuna scattered about. As this was a togo order, i wasnt able to voice my concerns in person, so i called. The lady who clearly made my sandwich as it was just her and her husband said they usually put 6-8 slices of salami and she doesn't know what happened and this was unfortunate. She didn't ask if she could make this better or sorry or anything. I should have walked out when I saw the asain at the register and realized this wasn't a typical.la bou. They are cheap as F@#$ and I will NEVER GO BACK!< /Review>< Rate>

<text>Ordered 2 burritos a very small portion of (asada) was inside the burrito and I literally mean like a couple pieces of meat and it was in just in the center so I was just mainly eating rice beans and cheese with aTon  of sour cream and the meat was vert salty we kept adding lemon but the salt would cut right  through  and the asada on my daughters taco had a wierd flavor to it. the rice could also use more seasoning it was on the bland side.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Alex was friendly and easy going. He didn’t push me to make a decision or push me to buy the most expensive phone, but assisted me in making the correct purchase for my needs. He explained additional options and protection plans and phone cases to better protect my investment. He was sure to transfer all my data and photos as I requested. When I returned to pick up my phone and additional items, he asked his new customers to wait a short time to complete my purchase. Thank you Alex! Awesome job!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I Purchase the iPhone X. The phone stopped working. Apple said it was a power issue. I decided to get my phone a more affordable route and figured no biggie since I was returning it within the first 14 days. The guy who helped me seemed but hurt and upset that I wasn’t willing to purchase a different phone. Business is business and I returned it within 14 days! Well he had the last laugh charging me almost $100 to return a phone that didn’t work in the first place! Oh well, at least I’m going to be saving money using a different method of upgrading. The nightmare doesn’t end, there are still charges on my bill for the phone that I returned. Now I have a headache on my hands.

This place is not honest so buyer beware. The other lady also charged me for liquid glass which I never asked for (on the phone that didn’t work so that’s even more money down the drain $54.99 to be exact). She acted as if it was a courtesy. I asked for a phone and a case originally, didn’t think she was charging me for something I didn’t ask for. Not to mention they charged me for several things that were not explained to me. These people are too worried about commission instead of giving honest service.</Text><Resp>{'time': 1524787445849, 'text': "We appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback Brittany Shires and we are sorry to hear you didn't have a great experience.

Unfortunately my experience started great and ended terrible. I was upsold a tablet for $10 a month and told I had 14 days to return if I didn’t want it. Apparently the plan I went with didn’t qualify for the $10 a month plan so it was actually $20 so I did return it. When I returned it there is a restocking fee so I actually lost all my money and had to pay an additional $5 to return it... really unhappy with my experience to switch over from ATT.</review>

I went in 3 weeks ago and was helped by Rusty who thank goodness is no longer working there. He instead of upgrading my line for my tablet adds a new line of course for commission and his manager there Chris sees what happens and makes him reverse it.. when he rang me up, Rusty charged me a new user see up fee for $20 and he charged me for a screen protector that didn't even install so I've already been ripped off for  $74! A few days went by and I tried to call them up to tell them they overcharged me but of course their phone was down.  A few more days later I drove back up there and spoke to Chris and explained my frustration and that i shouldn't have been charged  $74. Chris immediately gave me $20 back in cash but the $54 couldn't be refunded for the screen protector so he said a check would be mailed out. 2 weeks go by no check. I call them and wow their phone actually works.  Chris the manager had a bit of an attitude on the phone and told me loudly that the checks been sent out. A week later nothing.. I think he said that to get me to shut up..i would never recommend this location to even my worst enemies.  Go to Costco instead..<//Text>

The sales people here are lying, deceptive crooks who are ready to rob you of your money in order to make a nice commission for themselves. I came in about a month ago to switch from AT&T, since Verizon had just announced their unlimited plan that I was interested in.

First off, this place isn't even an official Verizon store. They are managed through A Wireless, who is a Verizon re-seller. They are very sneaky at not telling you this.

Rusty helped me throughout the visit, and at first he was great. We told me that I could switch over to Verizon for free and would get a new iPhone 7 if I traded in my old phone. It sounded too good to be true - and it ultimately was. Once I agreed to switch to Verizon and we were filing out paperwork, Rusty told me that the actual cost was going to be closer to $400 to activate the phone. I was really taken a back since he said the cost to activate would be free, but at that point it was too late to cancel. When we were finishing the transaction, Rusty tells me to choose what phone case I wanted. I told him that I didn't need one since I already had a case. He proceeds to tell me that the phone case is free and that it's included in the activation fee. We finished the transaction and I headed home with my new phone.

I got home and looked in my Verizon bag to take out my new phone case. Once I reach in, I realize that Rusty put in a car charger and a battery pack in the bag. "Wow, that was nice of him", I thought. I then decide to look at the receipt and that's when I found out the deception that I had just experienced. It turns out, Rusty charged me $40 for the phone case, $30 for the battery pack, and $30 for the car charger. These accessories, mind you, were the one's that Rusty told me were free. Rusty had also charged me other miscellaneous fee's that he had never told me about.

At this point, I decide to go to the actual Verizon store in Sacramento. The sales crew at the REAL Verizon store were in disbelief that I had been charged $400 for activating a new phone. They looked over the miscellaneous charges and told me that they had no idea what those charged were because the real Verizon doesn't charge those. They said that Verizon only charges the sale's tax for activating a phone, and that the price I should have paid should have been closer to $50. They told me to go back to Diamond wireless and demand a refund.

Knowing this, I went back to Diamond Wireless and wouldn't you know it, Rusty was there. The minute he saw me walking in, his face went white because he knew I had figured out all of the false charges. Rusty was not apologetic whatsoever and went on to tell me that those charges were correct and that they could not refund me. His coworker was especially bad and was laughing and smirking during this whole interaction. The coworker then proceeds to tell me that Diamond Wireless in going to take over Verizon soon, so I "better get used to it". Haha - immature and delusional!

I called Verizon customer service and told them what had happened, and they apologized for the actions and deceptions of Diamond Wireless. They said that Verizon does not endorse the charges that Diamond Wireless charged me for, and that they would refund me for the full amount of the charges. The customer service agent explained that they charged me so many false charges just so that they could get a higher commission. They kindly said that they were going to report Diamond Wireless for their fraudulent activity and thanked me for reporting it.

All in all, do not go to this place if you don't want to get lied to charged unnecessary charges. Do yourself a favor and go to the real Verizon store right down the street.</text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>4<//rating><review>We went there for the dessert 🎂, we had heard the pink champagne, strawberries, German chocolate were pretty good, added their Moonstruck chocolates. We got few slices of the cakes. They are quite generous in size. I do agree with the hype, they are quite fancy and good. It was just a little too much dessert for one person and it was heavy dessert. We had it pack and have it over a couple of days. I didn't get a chance to try the chocolate 😅.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response>< gmapID>

Had lunch with a friend and have been wanting to eat here for many years now, so glad we finally did!! They are the only place around that offers a Monte Cristo and it was absolutely AMAZING!!

I'm a big, BIG fan of Monte Cristo sandwiches and this one very well may have been the best I've ever had, it was absolutely delicious! It had the taste of high quality ingredients while also feeling the tummy like the best of naughty treats.

I've eaten at Madonna Inn many times and, as usual, the staff are great! Friendly and courteous, very on it every step of the way. The experience of the atmosphere and decor are almost worth the trip alone, you just have to see it to get it.

Copper Cafe also has a huge following for their burgers and my friend said they did not disappoint. It was a very healthy size and she said it was definitely a very high quality and very tasty burger. The fries were top notch too!</text>

No signs posted for Cafe or Steakhouse anywhere on the Madonna Inn property.  Just follow the aroma from the food.  Entrances are handicap accessible.  Public bathrooms are behind a circular bar with little passage room and then 2 flights of stairs down.  All first floor restrooms were marked for employees.  Food very expensive.  A coffee the size of a tea cup, and a piece of fruit pie was $14.00.  Good service.< /review>

This place is an overpriced gimmick. Came here with the old lady cause she wanted to taste the world famous champagne cake she heard so much. Turns out the recipe she found online tasted way better. Our server looked like he liked the place less than I did. He came by to take our order and then that was about it. The food runner have us better service than the server. Cool place I guess if you like the gaudy feel of a Vegas style themed restaurant/hotel. Otherwise steer clear.</text>

Our first time visiting... and we loved it! Today is my Hubby's Birthday and we drove about 5 hours here from Sacramento just for lunch. It was quiet due to all of this covid,  but we had a great lunch and enjoyed it all. Best part was his favorite Pink Champagne Cake! And it was complimentary in behalf of The Madonna Inn. ☆♡☆ And let me tell ya, it is the best one we've had ever!
"Thank You so much."<//review>

Great place as always. I learned last night here that apparently this place was also my first ever restaurant experience, a week after I was born according to my mom so I have a lifetime of good memories here. Fantastic service, food, ambience, and pricing. Overall one of my favorite restaurants. Styled after a Swiss lodge<//Review>

<text>The grounds were lovely for spring time. We were accommodated when we called just 30 min ahead on a Saturday! And got seated at a lovely window seat. We shared the Monte Cristo, good thing, because it was Big and delicious. Everything, including the bathroom was clean and ready, even though it was clearly a busy day. Very impressive. Kudos to the staff and chefs.</text>< Pictures>

Madonna Inn's Copper Cafe is a great place to stop in when passing through the area.  Service is great and food is good but on my last visit the coffee had sat in the heater too long and had a burnt flavor.  The Bakery is amazing especially the famous Madonna Inn cakes.</Review>

I have been making this a destination stop every time I am traveling up the Central Coast. My family and I stop and get cake to go. The cafe is design is incredible wood carvings around the cafe bar to pink sugar on the tables. They have the best cake and root beer floats! Desserts are a must if you are going there. They give you a kettle of root beer, to add extra soda to your floats. Everyone is extremely nice and it's an similar experience to Disneyland. Just go, I guarantee you will love it. I take all my friends there when in the area and each of them has loved it too!<//text>

They have outside Tent Dining due to Covid. We were still seated next to a large party which made us uncomfortable so we asked to move tables and they allowed us to. The food was just ok. The coke slaw was bad but luckily they took it off the bill.  The salad was not fresh but I didn't want to complain since we already complained about the Cole slaw. The hot sandwiches aren't as I thought they would be..I was invisioning a panini style hot sandwich but instead my turkey sandwich was just turkey on two slices of bread.. not a sandwich at all. The turkey was fresh and delicious and the large scoop of Mashed potatoes that came with it was good as well. Wasn't amazing but it was OK. Husband got the chilli sandwich and liked it. Overall I think the steak dinners and breakfast menu would be better to choose from because this Cafe gave me cafeteria food vibes. Once inside dining resumes I will definitely be putting reservations in for the Dining Room.I give 5 stars because this place is gorgeous and definitely worth the drive.

<Text>I'll admit it's not quite fair to rate this place given the fact that we arrived right before closing. Most of the desserts were gone and our waitress was not too attentive.
What we did have was top notch. My advice it to get there early.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

The whole building is beautiful and the service was great. The food was basic. To be fair the desserts looked great but not a big sweet eater so I passed.</Review>

We were there on a Friday night. Even with lots of parties, there were plenty of parking spaces. We wandered through the Madonna Inn tourist attractions and then sat down for dessert at the Copper Cafe. They were out of the deserts we wanted but the substitutions were delicious. We''ll go back.<//Review>

<user_name>Ron Haven<//user_name><Text>Madonna Inn is an incredible landmark off HWY. 101,  celebrating 60 years of bringing enjoyment and amazing accommodations to travelers world wide. The Copper Café and Bakery is part of the Madonna Inn nostalgia, offering incredible bakery goods, pies and cakes for special occasions and more. We just stopped by today and grabbed a slice of cherry pie that was to die for. While we waited, the staff were bringing out cakes that looked fit for royalty. Can't go wrong at the CC&B.

The food is good but the decor is why you have to eat here at least once in your lifetime if you are traveling along the central coast of California. It is as if you entered a time machine and were shot back to 1960's California. The Copper Cafe’s design and appearance is a combination of the set inside the bottle in "I Dream of Jeannie" with the interior of a train in the "Wild Wild West."</Text>

There is so much to love. Coffee, cookies, cake, and their food is so yummy. The staff is so helpful. I was surprised to get a latte with my choice of milk. This is one of my top favorite places on the Central Coast.< /review>

With covid, currently ordering inside (or by phone), and self-seating in outdoor tent - which had some decorations. Guessing that prices have increased to make up for added expenses. I got the Ruben Sandwich, which was about $20... It was definitely not as good as I hoped for, but not bad (no thousand island, not particularly large, and pastrami wasn't well peppered). Chicken Ceasar salad was good. Still glad they decorated for the holidays. Have had better meals there in the past and figure it's tough right now...<//text>

The salads bread and butter are a perfect starter or their soups. I really love the way the have used their parking/driveway for out for dining.

<Review>This pretty much historical landmark has been a staple on the 101 for many decades. The Madonna in is one of those places that everyone must stay at least wants. The restaurant has fantastic food and wonderful wait staff. Deafening tape time to walk around and see all day have to offer. Going to the gift shop and buy yourself some mango pepper jelly. You'll thank me later. Also, stop in at the bar sit on a pink swivel chair and order yourself a drink lol</Review><response>None<//response>< user_id>

The fresh outdoors of this restaurant has been a great experience and it's making history. Its never served outside before
It was great breakfast and the service was awesome. I had great coffee and a ham and cheese omelet. I will always love the Madonna Inn.< /text>

This place is a rare jewel. Let me tell you, you won't be disappointed. With all the scrumptious cakes you can find, all in one spot!! Make sure to pre order your cake if you plan on taking a full one home a day ahead of time. You can purchase slices there. But their cakes go fast!!! As they should. The service there is always on point. Very polite and welcoming.< /Text>

The portions are huge and filling. It was a bit pricey for breakfast, but otherwise awesome. Will visit again!< /Review><userid>113551177117473810656< /userid><Response>None</Response>< rating>

Recently dropped in to buy a cake for a friend’s birthday after being exposed to the Madonna cakes last year at a party. Impressive to say the least.

We were looking for a 6” diameter cake but they were packed and not selling whole cakes this weekend. No worries though because they sold everything else by the slice.

These slices of cake were HUGE! We got 4 which was honestly a whole small cake equivalent. Mykalya and Roxanne helped us out. Friendly, helpful and fast. We were in and out in under 5 minutes with Chocolate cakes in hand.

The cake tasted great and I’d love to see what all of their cookies taste like next time we are in town!< /review>

When we visited they had their COVID tent but wouldn't let us use the heaters, though we have seen people before and since use them. Our food was super expensive (as expected) but the staff was less than and most of the orders were missing something. It wasn't a great experience<//Review>

Top quality food and service, our waiter seemed to magically appear just as we would need something. Have been going to Madonna Inn's Cafe since our wedding anniversary 30 years ago. It's still as beautiful now as it was then!<//Text>

<Review>Madonna Inn has been my favorite place since I was a kid. I go every year to get my birthday cake fix, not to mention spa days with my mom, sister and niece and my favorite memory of my wedding day... of course the steakhouse is my all time favorite place to sit as far as decor, but copper cafe is still great. They have a great Monte Cristo sandwich that I just can't find anywhere else around here.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

This is the restaurant at the Madonna Inn. Good tent setup and coffee was always refilled during our breakfast. But it was pretty expensive.< /Review>

I love stopping at the Madonna Inn when traveling through SLO so I can visit the Copper Cafe! Talk about atmosphere! It has been a favorite spot for me since my first visit at age 8 with my uncle who took me to see their restrooms downstairs! ( A waterwheel 'flushes' the urinal that is designed like a panning slough in the Men's Room! Ladies room has adult and child size toilets with solid wood carved doors for each stall! Lots of hand-painted Italian tiles everywhere!)

The cafe has individual hand-painted murals in each alcove booth where the seats are all tufted red leather and the tabletops are full sheets of copper with hammered symbols along the edge that match the theme of the mural (e.g. crossed pick and shovel for the gold mining mural). Same for the curved copper-topped counter! With red leather stools and hand-tooled copper footplates at each barstool that is intricately designed to follow the theme! The wait staff all dress in period outfits to make you feel you are in a stately Austrian Mountain Lodge.

Their food is delicious and reasonably priced. The sugar on the tables is pink crystals! The water glasses are heavy colored glass (red, purple, pink, blue, green and clear) with a lovely 3-D image of roses. The opulence is rampant everywhere, and is beginning to show it's age, but as they upgrade, they always go for efficiency, classic design, and high-quality. And it doesn't stop there! They have a bakery inside the Copper Cafe with amazing CAKES!

They've toned down the pink and gold that would've made Liberace feel right at home in the main dining room for a more modern feeling of an inside garden party look.</Review>

<review>I’m always so impressed with the efficiency they display at our group banquets. I’ve been attending different functions for more than 40years and they never disappoint. The servers are well trained and it shows. Calm, relaxed and caring. Just had a function in late February and I was so impressed once again for their service.
Can’t wait to get back outside and go eat. I will make the Madonna one of my first destinations.< /review>< Pics>

First time eating here. My wife had the Monte Cristo which came with 3 jams/jams (strawberry, boisenberry & apple I believe) and I had the Reuben with fries. Both were very delicious, flavorful and not as greasy as other versions we've had elsewhere. My only real gripe was the amount and size of the flies near our original table by the windows where we were seated. Even though we asked to move they were still annoying us and the staff didn't seem to really acknowledge it.< /Text>

If you go for fast service on weekend don't go!
Waiting for more than an hour to pick up our order when they told us 20 minutes.
Had to cancel the order.
The inside is dark and gloomy that is why we decided to pick up our order and sit outside in the parking lot turn to sitting place, not very pleasantly, and after one hour wait when they told us another 20 min we just canceled.
Drove to downtown San Luis obispo and had an amazing time.< /text>

<Text>Loved it. I've always wanted to visit The Madonna Inn. My husband and I decided to stop on in and I'm so glad we did.
The bakery is right at the front door. Full of cookie and cake goodness.
The wood carving all over is great! The bar area is round and a good size. The restroom, you have to go down some stairs. It was kind of creepy. I wonder where people go if they're in a wheel chair.
All the tables in the cafe have pink napkins and the famous colored goblets. They were so cool. They have them in almost every color of the rainbow.
I ordered the chicken curry soup. It's more like chicken with gravy soup, but it was still good. Not spicy at all. I wanted to get some dessert, so I bought some cookies instead. I got the lemon and the Angel cookies. And the heart cookies sprinkled in pink and in red sprinkle. They were all Sooo good.
After we went and explored the big dining area, which leads to another bar with a huge fireplace and reading chairs. So cool. We went upstairs to the gift shop, bought some things and then headed out.
My husband said well stay next time. So excited about that.
If you are passing through San Luis Opisbo, this is a must stop, even just for a cookie. Look around, take pictures and all that good stuff. Or stay the night in one of their themed rooms. I doubt you'll regret it!!<//Text>< rating>

<rating>4</rating><text>First time eating here. My wife had the Monte Cristo which came with 3 jams/jams (strawberry, boisenberry & apple I believe) and I had the Reuben with fries. Both were very delicious, flavorful and not as greasy as other versions we've had elsewhere. My only real gripe was the amount and size of the flies near our original table by the windows where we were seated. Even though we asked to move they were still annoying us and the staff didn't seem to really acknowledge it.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Waiting for more than an hour to pick up our order when they told us 20 minutes.
Had to cancel the order.
The inside is dark and gloomy that is why we decided to pick up our order and sit outside in the parking lot turn to sitting place, not very pleasantly, and after one hour wait when they told us another 20 min we just canceled.
Drove to downtown San Luis obispo and had an amazing time.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<text>The food and service were fantastic, but man, is the decor ever dated! I've driven by the Madonna Inn for many years and on a whim, decided to try it. First impression: Like I'd been taken back in time to the '70's. Next impression: VERY nice, polite and helpful staff. Then I was returned to the modern era when their reservation system needed my cell number for a text when my table was ready. I did not see that coming.

Beyond the archaic decor though, everything was fantastic. Our hostess was a sweetheart, our server was spot-on when needed and the food came quickly and was VERY tasty!

Once past the culture shock, this is a very good place to eat! 😋</text>< Pics>

<text>We stayed at the Madonna Inn for a bachelorette party. We ate at the Copper Cafe for breakfast. The cafe is pretty crowded so we made reservations ahead of time. I was impressed by the speedy service and the little Madonna Inn touches. Even the sugar was pink! The food was a bit pricey but was adequate. But who's really going for the food?</text>< Pics>

They don't take care about cross contamination. The manager touched a piece of cake with hand contaminated with cash.
I  asked for other piece cake and they do it.</text>

Don't know how they manage to make such perfect food every single time I visit. The chili is amazing and always the perfect temperature to eat. Best sweet potato fries I've ever tasted and such an eclectic environment.<//review>

We made a quick stop based on a recommendation and wow, it was great! The prices were honestly lower than I expected and the cake and cookies were delicious. The decor was fun and eclectic. Highly recommend.< /Text>

They don't take care about cross contamination. The manager touched a piece of cake with hand contaminated with cash.

<text>Waltz into vintage 1958 great American road tripping motor inn and dining bliss. Exceptional service, beautiful quirky atmosphere, excellent meals (tri tip and chicken salad are yummy!) and cake to die for. Find out all about the Maddona family, unique glassware (and purchase one to take home if you like) and the dream come to life that is Maddona Inn. After eating, take a stroll through the complex to small gift shops and a colorful secret garden before you hop back on the highway.  Or spend the night.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFSWq1PP6QCl_tl8HG31jSV0lfTkPfH49G1qKh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Nice environment and old style, historic eatery. However, the food is not that great, service is slow and the prices are sky high. We'll go again while charging our Tesla but won't expect much.</review>

<Review>We ate breakfast at the Copper Cafe, simply because we'd traveled to the local town (5 minutes away) for dinner the night before.
Breakfast quality was good. Not great. Just good. The decor, the ambience and the fashion of the waitresses is what you go here for. All in all, my wife and two young kids thoroughly enjoyed the entire experience. Would've been five stars if the quality of food was better and in line with the cost of breakfast.</Review>< time>

How does one single person get a sandwich and a piece of cake and spent $30? Well that you can do at the Madonna Inn copper Cafe very easily. I had a Monte Cristo sandwich I've had them at Disneyland I've had them at other restaurants and they were amazing this was like eating a limp spaghetti noodle for lack of other words it was very soggy and very messy. I got fruit instead of the French fries and the fruit was the best part of the whole lunch. I also got it piece of the toffee crunch cake back in the older days like a few months ago they used to smother it with toffee shards and on the side there was toffee shards this one here was a little dry there was hardly any cake there was mostly the whipped cream in the middle and hardly any toffee. And for some reason they put almonds on the side crushed almonds on the side not toffee. I don't believe I will go back there for food or even cake it truly wasn't that good</Text>

My parents got their wedding cake here. Let’s say it was so good my dad and stepmom didn’t have any because it was all gone. Also the cookies are amazing! Highly recommend the Almond cookie and Angel cookie. Lemon coconut is more coconut than lemon and is pretty great too, and honestly at 85 cents a cookie it’s inexpensive and totally worth it to buy each flavor to try them all and buy the ones you like best. Staff is always friendly. Kinda crowded as it’s right by the entrance, I always feel in the way when ordering but doesn’t stop me from going back,<//review>

The Madonna is a MUST see location. If you can't afford to stay there or dine in their main restaurant, I recommended giving yourself a nice self guided tour of the place and eat at their coffee shop!

The staff is wonderful and welcoming. Exploring the venue is encouraged! Look at the bright pink main restaurant, bars, dance floor, fireplace, gift shop and don't forget the basement restrooms (a must, trust me)!!!

The coffee shop is like diner food. The food is average and it's pricey for what it is for sure... but it's worth it to sit down and enjoy the scenery. There is a book about the place they sell for $50 but you can bring the restaurant's copy to your table and check it out while you dine. It's super cool. The food is a 3, but the grounds are a 5+, which is why only 4 stars since this review is supposed to just be for the restaurant.

A MUST see!!!</text>

<rate>4</rate><review>Someone said come here for the cake and the cake is what I came here for! Since were in the area and just finished dinner, we decided to come here for dessert. We got the pink champagne cake which was recommend to us and it was really good. The slice is HUGE! Totally shareable among 3 people which we had. The pink champagne cake is a white cake with Bulgarian whip cream filling. The cake was light, fluffy and moist and the whip cream was really good. There was a bunch of while chocolate shavings as well that make the cake super filling. The nice thing was that it wasn't too sweet.

Overall, good cake. Dine in for a cool decor and ambiance. I totally wanted to take one of the goblets home (but you can get them at the gift shop... of course).</review>< pics>

<text>Best hash browns in San Luis Obispo if you are a breakfast person. Been coming for years. Food is always fresh and well prepared. Staff friendly. For a higher end place they really should upgrade their coffee. Lots of local roasters that could supply them with some fresh ground french toast or something. FYI also a great bar- drinks are always made very well. Little more expensive than some places for drinks but you get what you pay for.< /text>< pics>

They have fantastic cakes and pies. They also make a great ice cream sundae. It can get pretty busy on weekend mornings. They make delicious breakfast. I love the eggs bacon and hash browns. I've also had some good sandwiches with fries for lunch. I tried one of their salads once and was not a fan. The service is usually friendly. It's a bit hit or miss on whether it's fast or slow.< /review>

Waltz into vintage 1958 great American road tripping motor inn and dining bliss. Exceptional service, beautiful quirky atmosphere, excellent meals (tri tip and chicken salad are yummy!) and cake to die for. Find out all about the Maddona family, unique glassware (and purchase one to take home if you like) and the dream come to life that is Maddona Inn. After eating, take a stroll through the complex to small gift shops and a colorful secret garden before you hop back on the highway.  Or spend the night.</text>

Copper cafe is so picturesque! As you walk up the delightful aromas from their bakery wave at you.  The decor is reminiscent of a danish/Disneyland storybook land..The food is good and the prices are great...their service is very friendly..usually after we eat we visit the gift shop and i buy the goblets in all arrays of color! I have a collection at home.<//Review>

What a wonderful experience!  It was so lovely to take a older gentleman that I provide care for on his birthday to the Copper Cafe, where he could have his favorite dessert ((banana cream pie)) for breakfast and everyone in the restraunt sang Happy birthday to him.  It truly made his day beautiful and special.<//Text>

Madonna Inn. Great food. Great service. Fast service. Best cake in the USA. Great drinks. Best Ice Tea. Great breakfast, lunch, and dinner. You cannot go wrong here. This place is what all restaurants wish they could be. The food and ambiance makes this THE place to go in San Luis Obispo County. Note they have 2 restaurants... 1 is the Copper Cafe that is more of an everyday mealtime with incredible food. They also have a more fancy restaurant best for formal dining and date night. Both are AWESOME! Same menu if you ask for it. They also have live bands many nights (blues, jazz, and other softer but sometimes boody shaking music for both young and old).</text>

Meh. Arrived at 4pm. Ordered two Madonna burgers, special raviolis, and a steak dinner. The burgers and steak were ordered as medium rare, but arrived well done. The regular fries were way overcooked, but the sweet potato fries were good. Ravioli was not impressive.

Food took about 25 min, which is surprising for such an early dinner. The cafe was dingy.</Review>

Often times, when you return to a place of your youth, the trip only leads to disappointment. Rarely does the  modern incarnation live up to the image in our heads, softened with time.

Returning to the Copper Cafe after nearly fifteen years, I did not have that same reaction. It was great! From the decor to the service to the food, my expectations were met at every turn. If anything, the experience was better.

The corned beef hash is some of the best. And you have got to love the raspberry jam offered. Not just the plane old grape jelly in single-serve containers, but a dish of raspberry jam. Apricot too! The selection of coffee drinks and hot cocoa rival most coffee shops. Make sure to use the pink sugar!

All in all, this place doesn't just rely on gimmick, but on great food and service too. Very much worth the visit.< /Review>

<Review>Who would drive 3+ hours for cake?  Traveled here from the Bay area just to have their cake, it is that good. Their service is friendly and prompt. Took cake and cookies home.  Of course we had lunch there, it is a long drive.
Their sandwich's are very good and tasty.  Go there!</Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
Stopped at Madonna 2 weeks ago with my family for cake, just want my kid to get to experience Madonna cake. I am always enjoyed going to Madonna cafe but this will be my last time there. Lady who helped us so rude and seemed like we were bothered her for just a few questions about cake. The way, she looked at us from head to toe, we didn’t dress up because just came back from beach, just short and t-shirt. I don’t know we need to wear suit and gala dresses just to buy a Madonna cake.
I almost walking out but just didn’t want to upset my kid because we promised her a birthday cake from Madonna. Worst experienced ever!<//Review>

<Text>Meh. Arrived at 4pm. Ordered two Madonna burgers, special raviolis, and a steak dinner. The burgers and steak were ordered as medium rare, but arrived well done. The regular fries were way overcooked, but the sweet potato fries were good. Ravioli was not impressive.

Food took about 25 min, which is surprising for such an early dinner. The cafe was dingy.</Text></record>

This place is hard to accurately describe... The opulence of Graceland coupled with the decor of a Brothel is probably as good a description as any. In a word, tacky. Actually in two words, VERY tacky but I digress. After your eyes adjust to the dim lighting, they are unapologetically assaulted by the color pink.

As bad as all that was, the food and service made it worth every minute.

There were 15 of us that came on Mothers Day. The place was a zoo but they treated us super! They had our table set up in no time and our waiter was right there taking drink and appetizer orders with a jovial spirit and a big smile. When we got our food orders everyone dug in and enjoyed their choices. I don't remember what everyone had but as usual I of course had the Reuben. It was just right. Tender meat, not too saucy, just enough sauerkraut and bread that wasn't too soggy or hard. I couldn't finish it and I think everyone took something back to the hotel with them.

All-in-all this was a good place to eat, don't be in a hurry, wear some sunglasses and for goodness sake, try the Reuben ;)< /text>

Although everything we've ordered at the Copper Cafe has consistently been delicious, two of the main reasons we've been coming here for three decades are their coffee (which comes from Appfel ... a must try) and the unique ambience created by the copper top tables, luminous stained glass windows and custom woodwork. Worth a stop!< /text>

Stopped at Madonna 2 weeks ago with my family for cake, just want my kid to get to experience Madonna cake. I am always enjoyed going to Madonna cafe but this will be my last time there. Lady who helped us so rude and seemed like we were bothered her for just a few questions about cake. The way, she looked at us from head to toe, we didn’t dress up because just came back from beach, just short and t-shirt. I don’t know we need to wear suit and gala dresses just to buy a Madonna cake.
I almost walking out but just didn’t want to upset my kid because we promised her a birthday cake from Madonna. Worst experienced ever!</review>

<Review>I find that this place is expensive I had a Monte Cristo it was $18 and I got fruit instead of fries it was very soggy but the fruit was good then we got a piece of cake I feel that the cake is good but it's not like it was before I got the toffee crunch cake and there was very little toffee on it before the whole side was full of toffee and the inside seem to be more cream then cake< /Review>< pics>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>My husband and I stopped here for a quick bite in between lunch and dinner. We both ordered salads, I ordered a half veggie sandwich. It took over an hour to get our food. And once we did finally get our orders, the bottom slice of my bread was so soggy it fell apart when I picked it up. The server was very nice when I asked her for a new piece of bread. Then to top it off, there was a hard stem from an avocado in the sandwich that I could have cracked a tooth on if I had bitten it. Luckily I didn't, and I just felt it in my mouth.  The service has been consistently slow every time we have come for dinner in the past year as well. I think we are done with madonna. The novelty isn't worth the poor service from the kitchen.<//Review>< pictures>

I'd been craving a Monte Cristo sandwich for weeks. My last visit I got my fix. The Madonna Inn and Copper Cafe are a local treasure.  If you're travelling in or thru the area,  it's worth stopping in.  I'm a local and still I like going into the Cafe for a great brunch or lunch.  Try the black forest cake for a desert.</text>

Our wait person was great. The Christmas decorations were beautiful as always. The food was acceptable. The copper cafe however was dissapointingly messy! We saw  3 visible overflowing trash cans. Food, napkins, lettuce and silverware on the floor. Exposed shelves in complete disseray and dirty dishes left on tables. I'm sure if Mr. Madonna was still alive he would not approve!</text>

Tonite my family and I went to the Cafe to grab a quick dessert and coffee. Yes we were a pretty large group... but we were celebrating GRANDPA'S BIRTHDAY.  Well at our arrival the manager, He was very nice and welcoming... but our server was horrible.  She was pushy, rushing and seemingly bothered serving us... i wasnt sure if it was being uncomfortable under  pressure.  I spoke with her briefly after our dessert and let her know that she woukd not be receiving a tip larger than $5 because the desserts weren't worth bragging on and her (Customer Service) was  far below ratings... then following our conversation, she admitted that she had too many tables, and this was her reason for being very unprofessional, unfriendly, inattentive and rude.  At our leaving, she and other servers gathered in a group and was eyeing us as if we were the problem... Mine own experience  at this Cafe and from all adults in our party of twenty people agreed and will chalk it up to say... Madonna Inn's Coffee Cafe has lost 20 future guest...   ~Chef Nina</Review>

Dirty and filthy cafe! Their cakes are disgusting, I really don't know what the fuss is about. You can buy way better cake at Safeway for half the price! A slice of cake costs $9. I ordered champagne cake and black forest cherry chocolate cake. Both of them were disgusting! The table I sat on was fithly, they never cleaned after the customer before me left. The employees are weird, they litterally followed me from one side of the cafe to the other and made sure that I should make a purchase. The Cafe smells like rotten milk! To top all of this, me and my friend got food poisoning after eating their disgusting cakes! Also, their coffee is terrible as well. Please eat at your own risk and if you really wanna waste your money!</text>

<review>I've been buying cakes and visiting this business for quite some time (years even) and I must say today was one of the WORST experience I've ever had!   I stopped by the bakery at a  little before 2 pm and the boy at the bakery was busy trying to get one of his colleagues attention rather than focussing on the customers.  He did not acknowledge the guests and when it was time to service them, he was slow, unprofessional, and unproductive. Every time I visit this place, my experience keeps getting worse and worse.  Customer service is terrible and my overall experience was not worth the aggrevation.  I've dinned here as well and sadly to say the customer service is not good, food is sub par albeit it being pricey.  If it wasn't for their cakes, I would NOT visit this establishment at all!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><user>111277738649203701547< /user><resp>{'time': 1546469611510, 'text': 'Hello, and thank you for your comments, L.

A cafe unlike any other. The Monte Cristo is a must and the unique honeycomb cake is difficult to find anywhere else. From pink champagne cakes to rock candy stir sticks, the Copper Cafe must be experienced for oneself.</Review>

<Text>The Madonna and and The Copper Cafe are Icons of San Luis Obispo. They are simply must see and do once, at a minimum. The Copper Cafe is quite touristy, loud and cutesy. From the uniforms of the waitresses, to the never ending wall decor, and the pink, and more pink of the whole place. The menu is simple and straightforward traditional. I have had breakfast here many times, and it is always good. On the last trip it was lunch and the club sandwich was you standard no frills, but has everything club sandwich.
The bakery that is part of the Copper Cafe has the Black Forest Cake, that is a very long standing favorite cake. To view the cake is a joy, and the chocolate on top always gets attention. Walk over and check it out, or notice them on the way in, depending on the door from which you entered.
As is the case for all who visit, tour of the bathrooms is a part of every first time visit. It has been the custom for over fifty years to my knowledge. (my first tour was in 1971)
Next be sure to visit the shops up stairs because they are there and enjoy to overview into the big dining room of the steak house.
If possible a Christmas visit is a joy to see all the decor and decorations.
This is just one of the things you do in San Luis Obispo< /Text>< name>

<date>1410987318639<//date><Rating>4<//Rating><review>A friend and I stopped here on our way to Hearst Castle. We were told my multiple people that it's a 'must-see' and I can definitely see why.

The cafe (and I'm sure the actual rooms in the inn) had very ostentatious, medieval style decor. Everything from the pink glasses, napkins, and menus to the carpeting and curtains.

My friend and I split two sandwiches.

Beef BBQ: the beef was thinly sliced and very tender, albeit salty. I personally like salty food, so it was fine with me, but my friend pointed it out. Luckily, some extra BBQ sauce fixed it right up.

Hot sliced roast turkey: now THIS was the standout sandwich. More like an open faced turkey sandwich, it was topped with mashed potatoes and came with a side of gravy and cranberry sauce. It was Thanksgiving on a plate and it was perfect. Order it!

Yes the cafe is a tad on the pricier side for sandwiches, but you're definitely paying for the experience. Great service and friendly staff included! We were sad that we were too full to eat dessert, but there's always next time.</review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

<text>The copper Cafe at the Madonna Inn is one of those places in San Luis Obispo that you really should see. The Madonna Inn itself is quite lovely and the grounds are well kept with lots of flowers. The copper Cafe has a  historic old fashioned carved circular wooden bar which is terrific for taking selfies and a good place for  having a party.

We went to lunch with a bunch of friends and had a festive time.  The food is what they call Casual American fare.  My wife had the Monte Cristo, I had the Ruben. Our table-mates had the shrimp Louie that had lots of shrimp, and the turkey club which looked tasty with a big pile of french fries.

We were there for a birthday and they gave the birthday gal a giant piece of chocolate cake, which we passed around among five or six people and everybody got a nice big bite or two.

The truth be known you really do not go here for the food,  it's a fun place for a San Luis Obispo experience.<//text>< GmapID>

<text>If you're coming here for the food, the best thing is the cake. The lattes and hot cocoas both come from a machine and taste very watered down. The vanilla latte tasted like water with milk in it. The waitress said all danishs were special order. (Not sure what that means) so we were unable to order any. If you want to eat in the cafe it seems the only good food is the cake, nothing else is worth the cost (very expensive for the quality). I would only reccomend visiting to see the building itself not for the food.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Good service, enchanting table settings.
However, our beef sandwich had fatty tissue and ligaments.<//Text>
