I highly recommend Monica Ganjoo. I had a complicated case  and with her assistance, I was able to achieve a favorable result.  She was detailed and always kept me posted on my case by email or phone. She is very accessible and treated me with respect.
One thing I loved about Monica was that she gave off positive energy and peace on mind, also let you talk to her with no hesitation. With her help all the obstacles I had gone through had gone by kind of smoothly. I will always recommend her to anyone needing on immigration layer. I strongly say with no doubt that she is fantastic lawyer who will try to solve  your problem. Thank you once again from the bottom of my heart!<//Text>

Everyone is lost, they do not know what they have to do. They say they will sent you an email and NEVER send it. The lawyer is amazing, but her staff is unprofessional. They do not care about the clients. I think they should be better prepared and aware of their duties as paralegals/assistants. They definitely need  a supervisor.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<text>I was referred by another lawyer to this law office. After initial consultation with Monica and impressed by her professional analysis on my case, I decided to hire them to help me with my immigration case. It went very well! The initial application package was fully prepared by them after I provided my documents.  In the following months, they always call and email me in the first time whenever there is any updates or requests from CIS.  Meanwhile, I have asked tons of questions by emails. Monica always responses very promptly and gives detailed and professional information. This was really helpful during that long waiting time period.  Finally. I got notice for interview. Danny helped me preparing the interview process. He is very experienced about that. In sum, all of the attorneys are professional and kind. I highly recommend them if you want to get your immigration case in a good hand. I have met many other lawyers who only cares about money instead of your best interest. It is very important to have a lawyer who is always on your side and watch your case for you.< /text><GmapID>0x808fcc98a104e079:0xace3bfa77aee2b45< /GmapID>< userid>

I had the pleasure of having Monica as my immigration lawyer for my employment-based green card (EB2). She was always available to answer my questions (most of the times surprisingly fast!). Professional and, at the same time, friendly, caring, and reassuring. She came with me to the USCIS interview, which gave me tremendous peace of mind. I highly recommend Monica as an immigration attorney.<//Review>

Monica helped me during various stages of my immigration process.   Throughout the years, I found her to be quick to respond, very helpful and surprisingly (for a lawyer) empathetic towards my situation.  Most attorneys I've dealt with were always money focused, but with Monica she seemed to actually care about my family's outcome!!!    She's restored my faith in the profession.....</text>

It may be difficult to get an appointment with her for the very first consultation, but that’s because she’s amazing and she really takes care of her clients and she only takes new consultations once she knows her clients have been taken care of. She was worth waiting three weeks to get a consultation with. But once you hire her, you are in the best of hands. She knows what she is doing and she is amazing at it. She responds to your emails within two hours, even on weekends and nights. She is kind and really knows the law. I have also referred two family members and a friend to her after my case was completed and they have also been extremely successful and happy with her services.</review>< pictures>

I had a amazing experience with Monica and her group, I just won my asylum case with the help of Monica and her team. She guided me through everything and on the court day she did a great job, I Believe without her help I couldn’t win my case.

This law office is amazing. I’m forever grateful for all their hard work, not only were they able to help my family with my moms case; but, they did it in the most respectful and quickest way possible. Hugo and Monica are amazing they were with us every step of the way. If you’re looking for someone to help you and keep you updated on your case, I would definitely recommend this law team. Might I add, My family had previously gone to two other law offices for help with my moms case before this and just wasted our time and money. I’m so glad I found Hugo and Monica!< /Review>

Being a lawyer myself, I was super careful hiring a lawyer, I retained her after a great deal of research and found her trustworthy! She amazed me! She was responding my correspondence and calls immediately, she was always present and I never felt being left alone, and finally she won our case, as she promised.
I have referred  some friends too, all are happy. I highly recommend her.</Text>< user>

In my lifetime I have hired numerous lawyers!!! Didn’t get any results with any of them, not the way I wanted anyway!!! Until I met Monica Ganjoo!!! I remember how much she cared about my life and understood the importance and the effects of my case on my life !!! It was going to change my life for ever!!! She took over my case and everything just changed for better!!! I remember how she fought for me and how she never ever gave up on my case or me, until she won the case for me in spectacular way!!! She was so professional ,skilled and very experienced in her job !!! Every time I needed something or there was a paper or some important matter that needed to be taking care of, she was already on top of it and before I say or do any thing, she was going above and beyond to take care of it!!! I haven’t seen anybody like her!!! But I have to admit, the number one thing that really impressed me about her was that, she is not just a great lawyer but a great human being!!! A wonderful lady with wonderful heart for people!!! And that’s why in my opinion, she is the best person you can possibly work with and hire!!! Ever since I got to know her as my lawyer, I feel like I have a friend that just got my back no matter what!!! Thank you Monica for everything and Always being awesome!😊< /Review>

<Review>Atty Jason Baumbach and Atty Monica Ganjoo, two
of the best immigration lawyers in the bay area. They are reliable, truthful, understanding  caring and knowledgeable professionals that deeply concern about ones situation. I am thankful to them for helping us with our immigration issues and now
i can say that our family are grateful for them. If you have any immigration issues, they are truly the one you need. They will not let go until you got the result you needed. Also i would like to thank Hugo Servin for all the help he did for us. More power to all of you!< /Review>< GmapID>

<username>Maryam Alizadeh</username><resp>None< /resp><Review>I went to see Monica eight months ago because I had asked the community for a Farsi speaking lawyer and all 4 people I asked referred me to her. 3 had actually been her clients and 1 had a family member who was her client. Monica was AMAZING to work with. She was very friendly and super smart in her job. She came with me to both of my court hearings and responded to my emails within 10 hours each and every time. I got my green
Card. I am so happy. I have already referred two people to her and they are happy as well. Her consultation is only $50 and she credits this to your account once you hire her. She is a superwoman and I am so happy that she was my lawyer.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>Hello,
To every one out there looking for a highly qualified immgration Attorney I would like to share with great excitament  and gratitude that the services many in my family And I have been getting for the last 20 yrs from the office of GanJoo Law Corporation have been very professional and very fairly charged for their services rendered.
Monica , Hugo , and everyone in the office treated me with respect and dignity.
Whats more important is that they were able to help my family and I achieve all of the immigration goals we hire them to assist us with, all which had successful , happy outcomes.
You can always count on them to guide you through out the whole process , as they will provide you with the peace of mind that you may be searching for , for difficult that your case may be.

In conclusion , I would like to reccomend the office of Monica ‘s GanJoo Law Corporation for all of your immigration needs for you , your family , and friends.
Thank you Monica and team I will forever be greatful to you all for making my dream come true by legalizing my permanent residency immigration status and in doing so making me feel safer, and motivated to be a better human being and inspired to pay it forward.

This used to be a nice helpful office. Now all the staff are just a bunch of lazy people who never want to help you with anything. You have to call multiple times for them to answer the phone, and they always tell you they don’t have any appointments available. Useless..<//Text>

I highly recommend Monica to everyone, She is  a knowledgeable, professional, communicative, and overall such a helpful attorney. Monica has a calm, kind, and a nice personality and  always responded to my emails very quickly, making my difficult moments a lot less stressful. I really could not thank her enough.< /text>

<Text>After serveral immigration lawyer's assured us there wasnt much they could do to help my husband fix my immigration status, Monica Ganjoo's law office made it happen at a much lower cost. Although it was a long process, Ganjoo's law office guided us through it all step by step. They made us feel comfortable through the whole process, and were very professional. There are no words that can truly express how happy my husband, and i are!!! Thank you to all the people at Monica Ganjoo's law office.. please continue to provide your services to others in need.. you are truly appreciated.< /Text><Date>1563840601523</Date><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Monica is honestly one of the kindest, most generous people I know. When we first moved to the SFO, we were scammed by a horrible lawyer who charged us over $4,000 for doing virtually nothing. We went to Monica instead and found out so many new things that our old lawyer didn't teach us. She was so kind and helpful and patient with us. When I was younger I always wanted to be a lawyer because my grandma was but i always saw it as kind of a backup. Seeing Monica work and learning from her really put that idea into my mind again and now I try my best in school and at home to get the good grades I need. She's such an inspiration to me personally and I'm so happy we had someone like her to help us move to a new country. I hope that I can learn more from her in the future. We moved to a new state last year and Monica couldn't help us with our filing anymore since we weren't in California. We looked for an immigration lawyer here. The first one we found was incredibly rude and not willing to cooperate so we went on to a new one who we couldn't trust. I encouraged my mother to make a call to Monica who gladly agreed to take a look at our papers. Once again, she helped us with one of the last steps to our US citizenship. I'm just so greatful to have an inspiration and helper like Monica. Several immigration lawyers will scam you and try to hurt but I know for a fact that Monica would never. Thank you so much Monica.</Review>

Called to scheduled a consultation and was never told there was a fee of $100 for a 15 minute meeting to discussed our situation. The reception was condescending and didn’t care to help. Firm should tell all future clients that there is a fee at the initial of scheduling a consultation.<//text>

<text>Thank you, Monica for all the effort that you had put into our case. I highly recommend Ganjoo law office for anyone who seek a professional attorney. Monica is very honest, very trustworthy and very helpful. She helped me and my daughter through our green card process back in 2013. She influnced my 8 year old daughter with her strong personality, her classy look and professionality that she is my daughter's role model. My daughter's dream is to be an immigration attorney, like Monica, and she wants to get trained in Monica's office.
We moved to Utah but still Monica is my atterney. I contacted her again to help my in filing for my citizenship and as usual, she was there to help me out.
Monica is the attorney you need to contact for any immigration issue. She will help you with all her power.
Thank you Monica, we love you.</text>< Pictures>

Going to this law office doesn't change anything. Its really wasting money and
time. Its your choice to go to this law office
and waste your time and money. They are not responsible as they should. I dont care about other reviews. My personal experience with her was not positive. I dont know if she is really immigration attorney or not,whatever she didnt care our case. Her employees were so mean and disrespectful so she was. Whenever we called her office they barely responded our phone or if they responded us they refused talk to us. They just said Monica is busy or im busy then turned off the phone rudely. They were so irresponsible worst than her. All she cares is money but not her clients. She was supposed to follow up our visa extention case but, she was so careless about it. She is very arrogant. I frankly say that.  Again,its your choice to spend your money there.< /review>

<Response>None</Response><Review>(Translated by Google) They gave me an appointment on the phone (somewhat awkward)
And little understandable with a cost of $ 100 that was maximum 10-15 minutes
The lawyer only spoke English AND the assistant translated us, we felt that the lawyer did not clearly understand the case
After hanging up the call, they left a voicemail to tell us that the case could be done, that we communicate if we had questions, return the call several times leaving voicemail, later an assistant with a bad attitude communicated, (María He said to call himself) that if I had more questions, another appointment had to be paid, I did not understand why I had to pay again, If the appointment had already been paid.

(Original)
Me dieron una cita por teléfono (algo incómodo)
Y poco entendible con un costo de $100  que fue máximo 10-15 minutos
El abogado solo hablaba inglés Y la asistente nos traducío, sentimos  que el abogado no entendió claramente el caso
Después de colgar la llamada, dejaron Un correo de voz para decirnos que el caso si se podía hacer, que nos comunicáramos si teníamos preguntas, regrese la llamada varias veces dejando correo de voz, más tarde se comunico una asistente con mala actitud, (María dijo llamarse) que si tenía más preguntas se tenía que pagar otra cita, No entendí porque tenía que pagar otra vez, Si ya se había pagado la cita.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>The guys who run this place are very nice & knowledgable. They listen to your concerns, diagnose, and inform you of what they think you should do. They break it down so you understand. Their prices seem reasonable compared to other places I've been. They're fast and keep you updated on when your vehicle will be ready and they'll work with you on payment. I don't know much about cars, but I always feel at ease when they work on mine. 6 stars for zero - runaround. No suggesting services you don't need for a price bump, like some other shops. They're honest and thorough.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Being new to the LA area, I was in need of a trustworthy mechanic who would provide good quality service to my car. I shopped around my area for different auto repair shops and most of them had no idea what was wrong with my car and I didn't have very much confidence in them, until I came across Hyperion Auto repair. They were quickly able to diagnose my car and explain my check engine light issue. They were professional and seem honest and reasonable with pricing. There was an issue with one of my coils being damaged during the repair, however the manager took care of it and did not charge me, which really made me feel like I could trust them. Very honest and friendly people. I am one satisfied and happy customer, great experience and service! This is the only place I will take my car from now on. You guys have gained a for life customer, I highly recommend these guys! Thank you again!< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I have been coming to Hyperion for 5 years now and never been let down.  Hyperion takes the time to talk you through what your car needs and shows you the work that has been done.  Having worked as a mechanic in the past I am comfortable with the service he and his crew provide.  If you own a Porsche, Audi, or BMW this is the place to take it.< /Text>

This review is long overdue. I've never written one before but it's so hard for people to find Mechanics they can trust. I have been customer with Hyperion for over a decade and not only are they my favorite Mechanics, they are some of my favorite people on the planet. Gabby, Alex, Eddie and crew are, highly skilled, kind and most importantly, trustworthy.  They are like family and have always delivered top quality repair.<//text>

<Review>I sorta live in two places (San Francisco and San Rafael).  If my cars breaks down in San Rafael, I go to Firestone on Irwin (they are the best), but if I'm in the City, I go to Emerald.  I found out about them through the person who sold me their car.  They are the best!  Trustworthy, honest, and they will take good care of your car (and you).< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<text>Smith is always willing to look at our car and give his honest opinion. He always assesses and let's us know what's going on. He's honest, fair, nice and friendly. We always go to him. Never met such an honest mechanic like him. If he doesn't have to do anything to your car - he won't make up something to charge you more. Great and reliable. I try to always call before I go to make sure they have enough time for my car.<//text>< Pictures>

Also, their quote for an oil change for my Infiniti was $20 less than the competition, and they also did a visual inspection of the car, unprompted, while it was in the shop.  That inspection yielded a lot of very helpful comments along the lines of "hey, just thought you might want to know about X," and zero pressure to purchase or replace anything.</review>

Shouting from the rooftops I have finally found a car repair shop that I trust. Staff is very enthusiastic and knows what they are talking about. Came in with several different issues (in need of oil change, nail in tire, and a shaky motor) and they were incredibly helpful in each situation.< /review>

<review>These guys are super friendly/honest and will always give you the best deals.

I was recommended to come here by my barber when I told him my car was making a weird noise. I went there afterwards and they told me my power steering fluid was low. They filled it up and let me go FOR FREE.

Ive been coming here ever since for their honesty and unbeatable prices. Last time I went to change my tires, they only replaced 2 and said to come back in a few months to replace the other 2 because they were only 75% worn out.< /review><response>None</response></record>

I bought a used 96 Honda Prelude that turned out to be in bad shape. Alex and Gabby helped me understand what I could fix. They gave me a clear understanding of why and reasonable rates. After a few visits my car is running like brand new and will be for many more years I'm sure.

Their work makes me confident to drive my car anywhere and for any distance. Peace of mind is priceless.< /review>

<rating>4</rating><Text>What can I say that hasn't been said.  This is a very good place.  It seems impossible to find an honest place and good prices but I swear this is the real deal.  Stacey (yes...it's a dude) he is great.  He'll talk you ear off but it's because he wants you to understand what is wrong with your car, why you need or don't need something done and why it costs what it costs!  I bring our cars there and hope he stays comfortably busy and in business for a long long time.</Text>< Pictures>

<review>This shop has worked on my vehicles for 15 years. They are the BEST MECHANICS OF ALL TIME!!! I can not recommend enough. I strayed a few times and had the typical nightmare experience we all dread with car repairs. I learned my lesson. I will never stray again! Hyperion Auto is honest, fast, and they never try to upsell or push you into unnecessary repairs. Just straightforward quality work. Girls don’t have to be afraid here. Every customer is treated equally fair. Love, love, love them!<//review><Rate>5< /Rate><resp>None</resp>< user>

These guys are not just in the auto repair business, they are in the people business. I cannot express this better. It's like having a family doctor who knows you and your family and cares about you and your health. You and your friends are always welcome and will always get superb service.
Thank you Alex and Gabi and Edward and Nick and all.< /Review>

Honest. Honest. And oh yeah, honest. These guys won't try to cheat you. They won't try to pump up your bill and charge you for unnecessary repairs. They quickly diagnose the issue and let you know what is wrong. This is the second car that I've taken to them for repairs, and they haven't let me down yet. My go-to guys for all auto repairs.< /Text>

One reason for taking my vehicle there . Thanks to NINO for being efficient / detail oriented / calm/ and of course very happy to accommodate for more info. These days hard to find such people and consider him as  an asset to the company where he brings in good positive energy  white BMW X5 water pump replaced 10ZIN</Review>

<text>We were on vacation.  It was our last day and the night before we were having radiator cooling issues.  I called Hyperion based on their reviews.  I called and explained my situation and they said bring it in.  I was in their shop 20 minutes later, that was 8:00am.   They had the problem diagnosed, ordered the part and had my car repaired and out the door by 11:00am...incredible.  We made the 6 hour trip back home without a problem.  These guys saved the day.  Finding a mechanic when you are traveling can be more than concerning.  All the customers that came and went while I was waiting for my car knew the owner by name and chatted as if they had known him awhile.  That made me feel even better.  I don't normally write reviews, good or bad, but I felt compelled due to my experience to write one this time.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

So 2 weeks without a car from one place to another we were getting no where. They recommended this place so we took a chance. They kept our car and told us the alternator we had bought was bad. They kept the car then early the next morning our car was ready to go. This place saved my mom Car the Noth of us being girls we felt everywhere we went they were trying to over charge.

I don't know what these guys did to my spouse's 2000 Toyota Corolla (well, actually, I do: new clutch and front brake calipers) but now it actually drives like a normal car for the first time in years. And at a very reasonable price. And done in one day. I used to be ashamed and afraid to drive this old clunker, but now I'm just ashamed. I'd recommend this place to anyone I like (people I hate, I tell them to take it to the dealers and spend all their money and then laugh when their car breaks down again).< /Review>

It was just great.
Sandro is probably the best hairstylist in San Diego.
Just go and you will be convinced of that.
I’ll be there for my next haircut.
Guaranteed.< /Review>

My son loves this place he literally won't go anywhere else. I don't know if the PlayStation 4 has something to do with it 🤔but none the less the barbers always treat me and my son friendly and are very welcoming. They also are so informed on the newest hairstyle and trends which make choosing my son's haircut way easier. I give this place 5 stars and recommend this to anyone that needs a great haircut.

P.S. They even shaped my eyebrows for only 5 dollars. They used the straight razor to do so something I had never experienced. It was painless and looked just as good as waxing if not better. This place is great I understand why it's so busy.< /review>

Hands down best barbershop experience I've ever had. Been coming here since it opened last year. Have not not been disappointed yet great place skin fades razor line ups and shaves. Recommend this shop to anybody looking for a sharp clean high quality haircut. Also love the fact that this shop is located in a mall with plenty of parking and food places near by. Overall great vibe every time. Barbers are always friendly and professional.< /Text>

<Review>Found this place and decided to give them a shot. Walked-in without an appointment and got seated right away. I showed my barber, Juan, what I wanted and he took the time to ask me exactly how I wanted it all around. He had a good steady hand and his attention to detail was great. Overall one of the best cuts I've had. I will be back here for sure. Thanks Juan.< /Review><response>{'time': 1527636147840, 'text': 'Thank you for supporting the best barbershop in Chula Vista'}</response></record></dataset><record>

<text>Barber Cris was the 2nd chair on the left gave me the best experience I've ever had in a barbershop the cut was clean and the service was out of this world. Relaxing hot towels such a great job I will definitely be sure to come back. He even let me know that I could book my appointments online with him or any of the barbers super convenient will def do that on the next haircut< /text>< Pics>

<Text>Friendly staff, good vibes and attention to detail make this my new barber spot. After living in San Diego for a little over a year, I had trouble finding the perfect barber for me and I went to A LOT of different barbershops. And was either faced with stuck up/rude employees, or just laziness. And also I appreciated the fact that my barber doesn't leave me in the chair to go smoke a blunt in the middle of my cut ( i.e. Ace of Fades 🙄 and various other places) my first cut was with Leo and every cut after will be too and she is fantastic and very welcoming, how you want your cut is how they provide it. Made it feel very homey and comfortable. So after a year and a half I finally found my barber!.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

One of the most well rounded barbershops i've been to compared to all the other shops in San Diego. The barbers are always friendly, respectful, and welcoming, I recommend going to Cris, one of the most consistent barbers there always paying real close attention to details and making sure his work is as crisp and clean as it can be.< /Review>

Extremely overpriced. They do the same job as any other barber. Nothing special. Charged my 7 year old son 35$ for a 2 on top, 1 on bottom, and a line up.< /review>

Sorry but this place was way over priced,  my son's hair was not cut good at all! Some pieces of hair not cut at all. Waited forever,  and paid way to much.  Won't be going back .</review>

If you're searching for a clean friendly barbershop and an amazing haircut look no more fam... Andres was my barber and he completely improved my hairstyle. he took his time and gave a super clean fade as well as texturized my hair and gave me the look I desired. I will definitely be coming back to this barbershop. A+++</review>

Been Getting my haircut at Supreme since it opened up. Never had a bad experience here, every time you walk in you can feel those good vibes coming from the barbers.  Dre always delivers the fresh clean cut for any special occasion, Music on point, entertainment for clients just in case there is a wait, awesome light up sign inside the shop, and looks like a pretty cool mural is being done at the moment too , can't wait to see it when it's fully done. Highly recommend this shop to anyone near the Chula Vista area or anyone in particular, I come all the way from Poway to get my cut here and all I gotta say is "it's worth the long drive"
-ps.  Best thing if you in a rush and don't got cash, they take card. ;)<//review>

Great barbershop, I've been to many barbershops in San Diego from Carlsbad to Chula Vista and this is one of the best.
Sandro is very focused on details and he has many years of experience.<//Text>

I live here in the downtown chula vista area and work at the chula vista mall so I may be a bit biased on the location but you can get a haircut while your girlfriend or wife goes shopping and you get that real barber service as opposed to other malls you get that salon environment which many o business guys are not comfortable in.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1527636043807, 'text': 'Thank you supporting the best barbershop in Chula Vista.'}</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>Got my haircut here yesterday and the barber messed up my part really bad. Extremely bad. Most barbers spend 25 minutes cutting my hair, this guy took an hour to do uneven lines and uneven fades. This is NOT worth $35. It's not even worth $10. I didnt get the barber's name but the dude had dreads. Will NEVER go back there!< /Review>< pictures>

Sandro the barber has won several barber competitions around and outside of cali. His professionalism and cutting skills motivate me to commute every weekend from Escondido all the way to Chula Vista for a fresh cut. If you're looking for a clean fresh and sharp haircut this is the spot to go to by far. (The couch is comfortable so it's worth the wait lol.)<//Text>

I am station in San Diego and I never though I was going  to find an excelent barber like my barber back in New York City, I went to supreme babershop in Chula vista and got a Cut with Sandro, I have to be honest, Sandro is at another level in the barbershop business, he is very profesional and gives his customers a personalized service.  This guy is the best that I ever seen in this business, Thank you so much.....< /Text>

<Text>Ridiculously over priced; price point not equal to experience level of the unlicensed barbers within the shop.

Ex: 9 yr old boy fade = $20 plus $5 for a part. C’mon man — be fair. One barber charged $20 for an adult male haircut and mustache trim and charged my son $25. SMH.</Text><name>Rock Cty</name>< Pics>

Whenever anyone asks about a good barber shop, I always mention Supreme! The barbers at the shop focus so much on what's most important; cleanliness, quality and customer service. My nephews have gotten haircuts from all of the barbers and they're all great. I personally go to Sandro, he takes his time and focuses a lot on giving you those nice symmetrical dimensions that I dieeee for , you can tell he's a perfectionistl lol #eyebrowsonfleeeeek  Overall its just a cool atmosphere. 5 stars for sure<//review>

< Review>
I wish they have a 0-10 scale rating and 0 being the worst rating for this buisnes.    This place is a SCAM, they replaced my LCD SCREEN with a bad results after two days of replacement. The replacement cost me over $200.00 but I didn't expected an AWFUL JOB. The manager/owner, Gary doesn't respect the 30 day policy, he finds excuses not to fix his or employees mistakes.<//Review>

<text>They are absolutely the best! The technician looked at my phone and he knew what exactly I wanted. I dropped my iPhone a week ago and went to the Apple store, and got no help and another store told me to wait an entire day. But they fixed my phone in less than an hour. My phone screen was blank and he restored it. Their prices are very reasonable and they have good knowledge of phone repair.  I highly recommend them!< /text><user>117582156644197340742</user>< gmapID>

When I went there the technician was there and he took around 15 minutes to absolutely spot what more do you. Prices were genuine and the services were amazing. Very pleasantly surprised and impressed with their fast service. Highly recommended. Number saved for future needs!< /Review><userid>101910513221924077983< /userid></record></dataset><record>
<Review>I got complete satisfaction from The FIX. I dropped my phone, and the screen of my device was utterly shattered. I was afraid I would have to go weeks without my phone If I would send it to the Apple store for repair. But then I found The FIX, I dropped my phone in the morning and got it back within a few hours. My phone was working very fine, and it looks like a brand new device now. I loved this place.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dcb74a9261bb93:0x376c2a72accce45d</gmap_id><user>103920992338502089550< /user>< Date>

<Review>Careful with 30 day Waranties. Stuck with paper weight.

Customer Service: I took my ipad air to get it fixed, the battery would drain almost immediately after hitting 20%. This is a known issue on almost all devices specially after 2 yrs with it. Took it in, got it fixed, even doh the mall was closed(this was during the covid epidemic) the guy working there answered the phone said they wernt open but he could take my device threw the back service entrance and he would come outside. I tought wow ok this is awesome specially when everything is closed. Got it back in the afternoon all was great.

Problem: This were it took a turn, not 2 weeks in I plugged my ipad in to charge (original wall charger and cord not 3rd party) and when I woke up the battery was swollen up to the point were the screen lifted up away from the ipad. Even worse one side was still glued on one of the corners and the part had a hair line crack. The pressure of the screen lifting and the one corner still glued cracked my screen.

Reported: I called as soon as my device malfunctioned. No answer called the next day no answer, tought ok so their actually closed now. Until I got a call back and said they wernt open but the manager would be in on a Wednesday so i reported the problem and waited till Wednesday. Wednesday came and unfortunately couldn't take it in that day(work)so I called the Thursday and and said the same thing except this time he would be there on a Friday. Waited and called that day to get service threw the back door and no answer. Got a call back said he would be in the next week on a Wednesday I believe and went on well after 2 more weeks which is when warranty expires. Then finally no one was answering (covid was raging and everyone was on lockdown) the phone.

Follow Up: I heard the mall was reopening, went in and yes the front doors were open but everyone was still closed, OK IS IT OPEN OR NOT? I went home, I dont know when and which stores finally opened but now there's curfew. I knew my Warranty was NO MORE. So I tought that confidently I could take it in when I had time.

Mall Opened: I took it in today and yes there were open and went threw the whole scenario. Tried to show him the call log ofcourse things like logs could be faked or spoofed, but I had them and not faked. All he said is that they had been open for a month and that I should have brought it in on day one. I get there trying to prevent fraud but he said he would take a look at it. I was upset because were both the victims of the epidemic and circumstances and I know that if they were opened and I was still covered under warranty then they would have fixed it and that's it. Probably would have put the charge of the broken screen on me ofcourse their not gonna do it for free.I knew it was gonna be a problem going in, some kind of "BUT"

1on 1 Communication: I left my iPad there not discussing anything further about warranty or cost just that he would take a look at it. I came back 20 to 30 min ltr after waundering the mall. I asked if he had looked at it and he said it was still on the hot plate, it takes time to warm up the screen and check it. I said what if I come back ltr and he said that would be fine but before I go home I had to make sure that it was covered still under Warantie. There is no point to opened it up and come back after all that wait just to say well "yes it's the battery, no it's not covered, yes u have to pay AGAIN" or my favorite since its happened to me before in other places. They say "it wasnt the battery it was something else were it affected the battery." So ofcourse they have to charge me again.

Gets Dicey: after all that he would not give me answer on warranty or cost (probably legal reasons or liability reasons) the conversation went in circles I guess he got tired of me asking the same question and he kept saying that he would have to wait till he examined the device,(professional up to a point) finally he just went over grabbing my device and said that I would have to talk to the Manager, short from asking me to leave.Im out $100</Review><Gmap_id>0x80dcb74a9261bb93:0x376c2a72accce45d</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I was disappointed because I called on Friday and I got a quote of 69.99 to fix my screen and today when I got there the guy who helped me said it was going to be 85.00 then he said the best I can do is 80.00. I ended up paying 86.00. A few dollars more and I could have had another business come to my job and do it on the spot Instead of me going there but since I work near I was thinking it’s better I’m close and it’s a good price.
The quality is good, the new screen seems too pink not super clear like it was originally.
My phone was a iPhone 7 Plus< /Review>

<Review>THIEFS !! My dad took a galaxy s7 in great condition nothing broken, only water damage. Gary told me i could come back once he would attempt to fit it. He did not fix nothing and stole parts of his phone.
Phone is grey and when i got it back side was switched to a golden part and he tried to steal sim card insert, stole screws and to top it off the phone camera was missing
Very unprofessional , ignored me when i was asking him. DO NOT trust him nor the company as a whole with your phone.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This is the worst possible service that I have ever witnessed, I had taken my phone in and the guy said he would look at it right away after  two and a half weeks he had told me that the part would be here from china to fix the phone. Then when I go to see what's going on with it he still did not have it even at his place said it was sent out to someone else, then finally the next day I go to pick it up the phone is in worst condition then when I gave it to him wrong parts put back on it and not in any working order what so ever...to top it all off the guy is a total liar and very unprofessional if there was a way to give him no stars I would the worst possible phone place I have ever seen!!!</Text></record>

Please be aware that The Fix located at the Tyler Galleria does not honor their warranties.  They also do shoddy repairs. My daughter and I took in an iPad with a cracked screen.  They replaced the screen.  Within a week the home button could not be pushed.  We returned it. The owner, who refused to tell us his full name,  told us that the screen was improperly installed because they ran out of glue.  The owner openly admitted this.  They again supposedly fixed it.  Three days after bringing it home the screen started cracking around the home button. Small hairline cracks began to spread.  I took it back. It was still under warranty.  The owner refused to fix it.  He was loud, rude and belligerent.  He insisted we had to pay to have it repaired again.  Because we were stuck with a broken iPad we finally agreed to pay for the screen a second time, but ONLY if we could watch him do the repair (which he does at the front desk).  He gave us his word we could watch it done, but he had to order the glass.  We came in the next day as agreed upon, only to find that he had done the repair without allowing us to watch as promised.  We told him he had lied to us, already done one faulty repair and it should have been under the warranty in the first place.  He became angry, rude, intimidating and made negative comments about our race.</review>

<pics>None<//pics><review>Came in today to fix the charging port for my iPhone 7 Plus and fix the broken camera lens. Only thing I’m happy about is the charging port being fixed and functioning as it should, What really disappointed me was the camera lens part. After the new lens was installed, the black matte finish around the lens was damaged with scratches from his tools. Also the new lens wasn’t much new anymore, turned out even the lens was scratched while it was being installed, which pretty much means it’s a cheap lens (which explains the quote of $20.00 to install a new lens). Told the guy who installed it that it looked pretty bad, but he just tried to evade that problem rather than trying to fix that issue. I didn’t bother so I just left, the total was $92.44 including taxes for both the charging port and camera lens, not worth for a pretty messed up job on the camera lens, but I guess it is what it is, definitely go to an Apple store to get your iPhone fixed instead period!!< /review>< userid>

This place is a rip off. I came in with a brand new S9 and purchased a screen protector. When I got home I noticed that the touch screen was not picking up about half of my actions so I called Verizon and they told me to remove the screen protector. The phone works perfectly again. I called The Fix as soon as they opened and spoke to Gary. I explained what happened and his response what "Ok??.." I told him that I wanted a refund and he said that they do not give refunds and that I could bring the phone back in and they would put on another screen protector. Obviously I do not want another screen protector that causes my brand new phone to malfunction. I declined and he still refused a refund. I told him that I would be posting a negative review online and Gary was perfectly fine with it. Horrible customer service!</review>

I was disappointed I had called ahead of time to get a quote on  a screen replacement for my Galaxy Note 5 they told me it would cost  $150 plus tax and when I showed up I confirmed the price again for $150 waited 45 minutes for them to tell me that the screen they had their did not work I had to leave my phone there and pick it up the next day the guy who confirmed the price twice did not ring me but  he was right there looking at me argue about the price   and did not say one word could not admit that he made a mistake the one person ringing me up B.S. me that I was getting like some kind of a special screen better than the original it was horrible customer service. I would not recommend this place to anybody they B.S. customers to rip them off!<//Review>

Garry was extremely friendly and helpful when we came in to fix our iPhone 8plus. He has reasonable prices that are competitive with other places at the mall. I would definitely recommend the fix for all your needs</text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I went in to see if they could replace the camera glass on the back of my phone. They did not have the color I needed to match my phone so they told me they would get more in a day or two. I went back in two days later and talked to the same guy and he said that they still didnt have it and wouldn't unless I ordered it. Why in the world didn't he tell me that two days ago? Why didnt he offer to ordered two days ago? Why didnt he ask if I would like to order it two days ago?! Still didnt offer while I was there so i walked out and will take my business else where.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcb74a9261bb93:0x376c2a72accce45d< /gmap_id></record>

The owner of this shop, Gary, is corrupt!! Don't go here. They act nice at first, but then sent my phone off site to get a screen repair. When I asked them they said they do all repairs there. As I waited for the owner to make phone calls to get my phone back from wherever they were holding it, I was looking at the business license on the wall and the owner came up and ripped it down and said I had to leave now. They were reported to mall security and I lost my money I paid. In return they compensated me with a new screen I could take somewhere else to have installed on my phone. Found out as of today 4.01.19, it is a defective screen they gave me. Called corporate office and was told there are no refunds. Very bad business. Beware.</Text>

First of all, racial issues can never be a thing, as we're strictly sensitive about these issues, and our customer base includes all races, colors and genders.

In response, we've faced an aggressive attitude from you. Occasionally, there can be out-of-stock parts for specific brands and models. We order it anyways when requested.

I called this place this morning for an estimate on fixing my back camera and the guy was basically rushing me off the phone the whole time. I just called again to simply ask if i needed to make an appointment and how long it would take to be fixed. The guy practically yelled at me saying "it's first come first serve and i dunno, just come in!" I changed my mind.. NOT GONNA GIVE THAT PLACE MY BUSINESS!!! 👎🏻👎🏻<//review>

Bad customer service I got two phones fixed here and both have an unbelievable amount of issues now. Screens freeze, start turning different colors, and when you go back to ask questions about why it happens they are snappy, rude and just flat out disgusting to be running a business like that. I’m surprised the Tyler mall allows your store to stay open with how I have seen you treat costumers.< /Text>

We paid them seventy dollars and my son's phone never was properly fixed.  The person who repaired the screen, cracked it, as he was trying to put it on.  My son took it back there times, bottom line, never got repaired.

They will not give refunds 😡< /review>

<Review>DO NOT GO HERE. Besides the terrible customer service, they replaced my home screen button without my consent/knowledge. Therefore preventing my touch ID from working ever again.

Background: I shattered my iphone 6 screen about a month ago so I came here to get it fixed. The price and time was decent in comparison to the other kiosks/stores at Galleria. After 30 minutes I received my phone back and noticed that the touch ID was not working. Also there were two dots on the top of my screen that were not there before. This dissatisfied me but I was getting okay with not having touch ID. Although it was when my phone could no longer display anything that I decided to go back. This is now about over 20 days since I got my phone fixed. Although I had also recracked my screen. Thus, the guy working had blamed the whole issue on me. Until I went to cellularis at Tyler mall, the lady who fixed the LCD on my phone showed me that the guy replaced my home button as it no longer had the Apple logo on the inside of my phone.<//Review>< username>

Today I had them fix my 3rd phone. It had been broken and out of use for 4 months. Friendly and reliable service! They even asked about my other devices that they fixed previously. "If there is an issue with the service, come back in and we will fix it"! Can't say enough good things about them! Not only would I consider going back there, I have gone back time and again!</review>

BEWARE!!!!! Absolutely no customer service. Went in for a battery exchange and came out with my ear speaker crackling.  Talked to both associates at the store to see what they can do for my inconvenience. They were extremely RUDE, no help at all. This place will damage your phone and won't even have the decency to apologize. I WARN YOU THE PEOPLE HERE ARE RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL. HIGHLY UNSKILLED, PRIMITIVE WORK. 2 Thumbs Down.<//Review>

The Fix is overall a great place to go to for fixing an issue with your phone. Great customer service and very spot on about what is wrong with your phone. Takes about 15-20 minuets and very reasonable pricing.</review>

SPRINT USERS Never get it done here!  They are $10 bucks cheaper than going to sprint if you have insurance.I went to get my iPhone screen fixed and within a month my phone screen just went black. I took it to Sprint because I had insurance and they couldn't do anything because of the third party screen and they said they were at fault because they don't use the right tools. Now I have to pay $200 to get an new iPhone and it all could've been avoided if I just went to Sprint. Don't waste your time here AWFUL</Text>

So after 2 weeks I seen my screen was not on right. So I took it in and she called me a liar and it was my fault why am I just now bringing it in. I did have an incident with water that had nothing to do with my screen and now Gary the owner will not fix my phone and will not give me my money back I spent $200 to fix a cracked screen and now I have pixelated lines on my phone so this place you should avoid at all costs he has rude employees and he's rude himselfmb<//Review><UserId.>102104057246630025160<//UserId.>< time>

<text>WORST SERVICE EVER!!!!! I took my iPhone for a screen replacementI paid around $100, I never got a receive! The following day my iPhone wasn’t turning on. The acreen was totally black but the calls were going thru... I took it back with the same black male, He was VERY RUDE! And he says he couldn’t do anything about my phone bc I did not have a receive when he doesn’t gives receives... anyways I took my phone in the 2nd Floor next to Macy’s... the guys were super nice and I paid a fraction of what the other place was charging me... PLUS THEY OFFER A 90 DAY GUARANTEED!!! They Actually give receives! Plus you get also register on their system in case your receive get lost.<//text>< Time>

Very horrible service and very unprofessional, took my IPad mini 2 to get the screen replaced. After waiting and hour and a half they had to l send it to an out source and after 3 weeks and me calling them to see what going they finally told me that they still couldn't fix it. Plus they damaged some interior parts and the power screen wouldn't even turn on. Some how it went from a cracked screen to a non operable IPad. They tried saying that when they opened it the parts got loose and that's what cause the damage. They wouldn't even take responsibility for them damaging my IPad. They just handed me back a usless IPad. I recommend nobody ever use them.< /review>

<review>NO!!!!!

Please, PLEASE DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE.

It is a scam beyond all reason.

Overpriced, rude, and when you bring in the item that they "repaired" they won't have anything to do with it.
They are absolute SCAM ARTISTS< /review>< user_name>

At the moment all the swings, etc, are tied up so they can't be used because of the pandemic. There is a contingent of people who camp near here who hang out at the picnic tables. Bathrooms are broken into nightly and used for privacy needed for sex and drugs (so do NOT use the facilities here). The City can't keep up with the maintenance required.< /Review>< Pictures>

Place is very nostalgic and as creepy as it looks, the bridge is one of the most memorable areas for me mainly since we'd walk from the trails and pretty much encounter animals and trash there though I wouldn't suggest going down there really.<//Review>

The park itself has a good layout with two separate playgrounds, one for the older kids and one for the toddlers with sand floor. There are some benches and a fire grill, parking is not an issue. The reason why I'm giving this park 2 stars is because there are plenty of sketchy characters and a creepy bridge full of garbage and filth that you have to cross to get to the park.<//review>

This is the place to go if you want fresh fruit, fresh juices or a smoothie. They have other items like food: quesadillas, tortas, etc.but I've never had it. At least not yet. I always get fresh fruit. Today I got fruit extra pineapple 🍍. The ladies inside are so nice and friendly. As long as I find a place to park they got my business.<//text>

I absolutely love this place, I have been coming here for 4-5 years and the food has never failed. Ana and Conchita are lovely, the service is always great, it is always clean, the atmosphere is happy. Everyone is so kind. Good place to eat, I recommend the pollo empanizado torta, the fresas con crema, and the pollo empanizado sandwich. I love it !!<//Text>

Let me tell you, before I brought my car in it was filthy! I am a coach and constantly have a lot of sports gear in my car. I was hesitant to bring it to this wash, but I was in the area so I thought why not. And boy was I happy to get my car back. They truly live up to their name of Dirt Busters. This place deserves 5 stars! I will definitely be returning. Thank you so much :D<//text>

The front attendant was nice and explained the level of carwashes. I said I want a detailed interior and Exterior car wash before family arrived as I will be driving them around for the holiday and have a dog. I wanted the dust and dog hair gone. Absolutely none of the interior seem to be clean passed a wipe down with a dry cloth I am thoroughly disappointed< /Text>

<text>Best Car Wash! Super impressed with not only the way the car looked, but the staff was beyond professional. Today they went out of their way to quickly return a diamond earring they found when vacuuming my car. I was very impressed with the outstanding customer service, sincere actions and attentional detail.  Quality customer service is a dying art these days...If you want to be treated like a VIP Dirt Busters Car Wash will not disappoint!<//text><username>Stephanie Olsen<//username></record>

My car always comes out looking fantastic after taking it to Dirt Busters. I live down back roads and always have my two dogs in the car with me. So I regularly need a detailed wash and they never disappoint! 100% recommend taking your car to dirt busters to get that professional detailed clean. Also was obsessed with the purses and apparel inside the gift shop. I have got some of the best cards here as well. My husband  gets his hair cut while waiting for his truck when he takes it in. It’s a one stop shop that’s for!  Check them out!! 👏🏻👏🏻< /Review>

No thanks. Been here several times and 3 times the vacuuming was not complete. Even returning once for them to re-vacuum. It's not okay to pay for a service and the work is incomplete. I do mot have the best mobility to clean my large SUV, so I depend on companies that provide car washes. I am done and not returning any time soon, taking my vehicle elsewhere for cleaning.<//Text>

<text>Staff was friendly and professional. I selected my wash and felt comfortable my car was in good hands. The store was clean and comfortable to wait in. Car came back spotless. I will definitely be getting regular washes when I am in the area.

Spent 100$ on the Deluxe package and dropped off the car for 2 hours only to still find stains on the seat. Also dirt on outside of car still. We notified one of the cleaners only to tell us that it would an extra charge and that they only wipe stains and dont clean them. Ridiculous. Do not spend money at the this place!< /text>

<Review>This is my go to place to get my car not only washed but detailed. The staff that works here are always courteous and helpful. I was selling my Ford Explorer and had it detailed beforehand, I swear they made it look like it was brand new right off the lot. I’ve tried other places and I never leave as happy as I do from Dirt Busters, you can tell the people working there take pride in what they do, the experience is top notch<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Honestly, they never really do a great job. I could definitely do a better job myself at home but that's the problem is taking the time and having all of the equipment to clean it. The worst is that I was getting my car ready to sell which is why I took it in for the cleaning but when I went out there to wipe down the seats because they were going to charge me $75 to do a steam cleaning on the seats so I decided to do it myself, it took me just a couple minutes with some hot soapy water and it looks great. But as I was wiping down the interior which is what I thought they were supposed to do it was not done very well. And the windows are still streaky so I'm going to have to redo those too.<//text>

<text>I went to get my truck cleaned and the inside vacuumed and it came out amazing!  My white truck hadn't been that white since we bought it, and the inside looked good as new!  The workers were also very friendly and I got my money's worth.< /text><rating>5<//rating>< user_name>

For people reading these reviews, please remember: most people don't post reviews unless there's a negative experience. Often, complaints aren't even applicable to the service they're receiving, like not receiving vacuuming on an exterior-only wash, but not mentioning this in their review 😱

P.S. tip the vacuumers; they don't get much love, and it sucks for them.< /text>< Pics>

I had my car done here. Right as I drove away both of my side mirrors fell off. When I took it back up there. They said it could not have been them. I literally just left when this happened. No I'm sorry nothing at all. I now have to replace both them for something they did and blamed on me? It looks like they pushed the mirrors in too hard and the piece that held the mirrors in place fell of. The person just  pushed it back in.They also did a terrible job with the inside of my car. looked like it was half done. Looked like they only washed one side of my car. Will never go back there.  This was in Roseville.< /text>

Closed Indefinitely Due To Government Shutdown.

Otherwise, this is a very good place for a carwash. They did a great job cleaning my car last month. Looking forward to when they re-open!< /Review>

<Review>I highly dont recommend this place for INTERIOR OR EXTERIOR. The big guy ed drives away paying customers that forked out a few hundred dollars to clean the interior.  I went for the more expensive package (Complete package, valued at 300$) but only needed the interior done. There was tons of bug squat all over the front end of my car after the body wash. They only wiped down my car, my seats weren't shampooed like promised and paid for. There was a huge misunderstanding on my part, which was handled extremely poorly by ed. He is rude and kinda slung out and will laugh in your face in a condescending way, when you are giving him your upmost respect.  Hes like 30 and acts like his daddy owns the place. All of this happened my 1st time here.  I will never come back. Mark my words. There was ashes and dust all of the back of my car. I had to clean everything myself! My center counsel was untouched as well.</Review>< time>

A little pricey and it takes about an hour. Seems tailored to a more affluent crowd. Average job in the car wash.<//text>

Wasn't as great as I hoped. It was surprisingly fast but then I could see why. The customer service was great but the work not so great. I got the silver package but from i could see it was obviously rushed even though it wasn't very busy. I think I'll stick to scrub boys which is my go to car wash but I passed by here and decided to give it a try. Not impressed though.</text>

All the workers are great people. But the owner is a scammer. Took my car two days ago and it looked great but the day after i noticed my windows were all smeared from the window cleaner. I asked a worker that works there and he said the owner makes them delute their products with water. Will never go back there again!!!!< /review>

<text>Very Poor Eye for Water Spots, Carpet Vacuuming and Attention to Detail!! The Staff is Lethargic and VERY Rude when you address any concern over poor interior vacuuming, wheel cleaning or wipe down. They act like you're a criminal when you request they do the job you paid them to do and at PREMIUM PRICING! Just because it's located in "Granite Bay" doesn't mean you're getting a top notch, first class car wash! You may as well go to Quick-Quack two doors down and do it yourself (CORRECTLY) so, your car is sparkling with attention to detail as opposed to a mediocre, Half-Hearted "Premium Car Wash" from these lazy, unappreciative and disrespectful people!!< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809b1fd745da168b:0x9cd036cb8c24c7df<//gmap_id></record>

<text>The one star reviews speak for themselves. I got a bronze wash, which includes exterior and interior cleaning. Unfortunately, my windshield is still full of dirt and grime, and so are the mirrors. Inside, the seats still have little pieces of dirt. They did not lift the floor covers to vacuum underneath. I will not be returning. Save your time and money and go to Bob’s car wash. I never had any issues with them.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><rate>1< /rate>< gmapID>

They did not wash out the bed of the truck - there is literally now mud in the back of the truck after I paid $200.00 for them to detail it. They put so much armor all on the floor of the truck and then put a paper mat down, I almost fell trying to get into the truck it was so slippery.  The truck does not even look like it was washed, they said they could have cleaned it better if I let them clay it.  I'm extremely disappointed and feel like I was taken advantage of.<//review>< pics>

<Text>Did a decent job, but man, they took a long time! No complaints about pricing or quality, though. If you need a car wash at a fair price, and have some extra time on your hands (took them 45-50 minutes to finish my car), this place is well worth a visit.< /Text>< Rating>

The ticket writer was very patient with me, the car wash is very good looking with a nice lobby. There is a barbershop located inside. I had my hair cut here. 5 stars on the hair cut also, and i am very picky with my hair.  The service was great, fast and efficient. Definitely got my moneys worth. They also offer auto glass repair and replacements which i thought was great also because they work with your insurance.< /text>

<review>Don't go! People are lazy and don't do their job. The thresholds were dirty so I asked them to clean them. They said I didn't pay for the "inside shine". It wasn't even about shining, there was mud there so I wanted it cleaned. What did I pay for if there is mud left? Trunk wasn't even vacuumed, windshield had streaks on it and the cup holders were dirty/untouched.</review>< Resp>

This place is TERRIBLE employees are EXTREMELY LAZY from the detailers to management, they make excuses as so why your  vehicle isn't clean just so you would have to pay additional fees. I've been getting my 4 vehicles washed and detailed for yrs this is Truly the worst experience that I have ever had if you want your vehicle tended to Right the 1st time Please Don't go there the Madison location is Much Better!!!!!< /text>

<Review>HORRIBLE...I will NEVER GO BACK.....I actually made a point to create an account so I could review how BAD this place was.

No wonder the TIP jar is prior to getting to the car??

Totally reinforced my lack in faith for a good quick car wash.  Crumbs and leaves still on the inside - what wipe down on the inside?  I think a damp rag easily could have removed the minimal splashes of coffee around the console?  My car is NOT that dirty....they did not even move the floor mats?

As for the outside....my car is white - it hides dirt pretty good but SHOWS when there are streaks where the dirt was NOT wiped off.

Not to mention as they drove away they left the back hatch wide open????  I had to show them so they could shut before they drove off???  So bummed....

I should have either bought a $20 lottery ticket or threw my twenty out of the window.
Either way -  got nothing for my $20.< /Review><name>4closer HaleeDaily< /name></record>

I went into this car wash which is close to my work. I was greeted right away and the gentlemen who helped me (James) gave me a lot of good information since I was unsure of what I wanted. When I went to pay the cashier was able to let me know about all the ways that I can save money at this location. Before I knew it my car was clean and it looked amazing. I am so glad I found this car wash, I will be going back for sure.</Review>

This place does a fine job cleaning the car and is a fair price if you buy a package deal. They have a nice place to wait with kids toys and offer free popcorn. I have been disappointed that they are not consistent with vacuuming the trunk so make sure you say something when you drop off and leave the trunk open.<//text>

They wanted to charge me a $5 fee because my car was extra dirty, yeah that's why I'm at a car wash, that's literally what you do here! I went next door to Quick Quack, $7.99 thru the machine. Complimentary dash wipe which I used to remove the small amount of residue left on my hood afterwards and a free self serve vacuum. I'll be going there from now on!< /Review>

Paid$140 for upholstery shampoo and they didn't get everything out. Some areas were just plain missed. No these weren't unremovable stains because I have removed them. Also didn't thoroughly clean bottoms of door interiors, arm rests, and accurately the foot areas in the front seat. Steering wheel not cleaned. I was in a hurry or I'd have said something but I didn't have time.</text>

<Date>1497549661829< /Date><rate>1< /rate><text>I've been coming to this car wash for years and everything about it has gone downhill. The service, the quality, the urgency to finish cleaning a car, and the organization. The cleaning 'packages' don't nearly include what you think and even then your car doesn't turn out like it should for the cost. Today I asked them to use a pumice stone to get some minor fuzz off the back seat floors and he wanted to charge me $30 (which last time he wanted to charge me $40 for the same thing). Bauers car wash on San Juan doesn't charge any extra for the same service. There is a lack of organization and/or job responsibility for the workers drying and wiping down after the wash. I watched the same windows get sprayed and wiped by 3 different people.  This is a really great and convenient location for a car wash but I will not be coming back here. Better off detailing my car myself.</text>< pics>

Worst car wash experience of my life. My car didn’t look clean at all. Don’t waste your money here. Workers are lazy and don’t care.</review>

<Text>They need to take notes from Classic car washes in the bay area. They miss way too many spots while wiping down the car. Someone needs to train them to conture their hands to the shape of the car while wiping it. I ended up doing it myself while they watched. I did it in half the time it took two of them to try and do it.<//Text>< Pics>

This place is expensive and they do a horrible job. My wife took my car here to have it cleaned and they did not vacuum the trunk, did not wipe the door tresh hold, did not wipe the windshield all the way. You talk to them and they want you to pay more for a service you already paid. There is no customer service here, save your money and have your kids do it. They will do a better job than these incompetents and lazy people.</review>

She was so messed up.  I took my truck to dirt busters.  and right off the bat their cashiers were so nice and they insured me that my baby would be back to perfect in four hours.  I did not believe it but they did it all the scratches were gone.  Also they fixed my wax that had been stripped off from the harsh crappy chemicals at quik quak.  they explained to me that their chemicals were friendly on the paint and would not do any damage to my baby like other car washes.  these guys at Dirt Busters know their stuff.  they are like car gods!!!!!!!  they even fixed the chips in my windshield for free!!!!!  and i cant remember the price but it was cheap, they restored my headlights.  they look better than ever before.  I am now a die hard dirt busters customer.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809b1fd745da168b:0x9cd036cb8c24c7df</GmapID></record>

I am  very disappointed with the service I received . I came to the GB location a week ago and received a Platinum cleaning ( this is the top of the line option $40) on my new car. I tipped out the service cleaners before I saw the inside of my car. They did not wipe anything down inside and they did not vacuum the seats. Once I got home I called the center and they offered me a complimentary cleaning. I come back to have the job done over a week later. this time my car has spots the windows are streaking, they did not clean the mirrors and still did not vacuum seats or wipe down the interior. I am not going to call them again, at this point I am sure they just don't do a good job. I will take my car elsewhere from now on.<//Text>

I was not impressed with the carwash that I received.  The doors were left dusty.  Paid the $21.99+tip and did not feel that I got my monies worth.  After I left, I did not want to go back because I had an appointment elsewhere.  Just make sure to check the job before leaving the lot.< /Text>

Horrible service, missed the doors and didn't vacuum the back. Then gave attitude when I questioned them...never going back. Way over priced for serviced.<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) They have rude people cleaning if the client sees a bad detail and asks for help, he answers badly, ask for the cleaning service of my vehicle and especially the interior, do not expect to see so much dirt in my car, it seems they are not trained for this job, I do not pass vacuumed where else requested the seats are dirty did not want to clean dirty work and improper collection

Tienen gente mala educada limpiando si el cliente ve algún detalle malo y pide ayuda le responde mal , solicite el servicio de limpieza de mi vehículo y sobretodo interior no espere ver tanta suciedad en mi carro parece no están capacitados para este trabajo no paso aspirado donde más lo solicite los asientos están sucias no los quiso limpiar trabajo sucio y cobro inadecuado<//Text>< GmapID>

(Translated by Google) I went here yesterday and the man standing at the door was really kind. I went to LA Home Shopping World for the first time, and I was surprised to find that there are a lot of Korean things in the back that are really cheap and pretty. I purchased one diagnosis provided by Kyung Hee Hwang, but I was even more surprised by giving a box of cultivated wild ginseng root as a gift. It was nice because the prices were so good and there were a lot of sales. 😁

어제 이곳을 다녀왔는데 문앞에 서계신 남자분 정말 친절하시더라구요.  엘에이  홈쇼핑월드를 처음으로 갔는데 뒤쪽에 한국물건들이 정말 싸고 예쁜게 많이 있어서 깜짝 놀랐어요.  경희황제공진단을 1개 구입했는데 산삼배양근 1박스를 선물로 주셔서 더 깜놀했네요. 가격들이 너무 착하고 세일많이해서 좋았네요. 😁<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) On Saturday, when the parade of the 3-1 parade was held, I believed that the broadcasting station and the president of Home Shopping World would advertise in the advertising interview, and in the head office in Los Angeles, there were three pieces of Kiyokoko, seven coded frying pan and Wok, several fractions of men's perfume and household necessities I bought it because it was bought by the consumer's belief about the station and the boss, but I am now very unpleasant to write a review here. I made a quiet call with the boss, but no! I was uncomfortable because the boss told me that the golf emperor Tiger Wood spent $ 10 on a frying pan that does not stick to food without oil, as he does not have any health oil in the egg fry. I tried the egg fry without oil, but I was totally stuck and tired, I poured olive oil, I tied it all up! And I immediately feel scared. It's not a scam to pay tens of thousands of dollars! It's a fraud targeting $ 10 bills for false broadcasts and false advertisements! 
Do you really see your fried eggs and advertise them directly with this frying pan? What about the station announcers? If you have done so, you should not do false advertising to the Koreans. If you meet properly, you can go into a lawsuit.
I bought 3 bottles, believing that it is good, but I can not believe this is also up to the accessory that comes up ... I hope that you know that the whole of home shopping world things can distrust because of the frying pan!
For reference, the first time I visited the store with lots of advertising and expectation, it was shopping at "Home Shopping World"! It's completely disappointing!

지난 3-1절 퍼레이드가 있던 토요일에 방송국과 홈쇼핑월드 사장님이 광고인터뷰에서 재밌게 광고하는것을 믿고 LA본점에서 경옥고 3통, 7중 코딩한 후라이팬과 Wok, 남자향수 및 집안 필요품등 몇백불어치를 매입했는데 그건 방송국과 사장님에 대한 소비자의 믿음으로 산 것이였는데 지금 상당히 불쾌해서 여기 리뷰를 씁니다. 사장님과 조용한 통화시도를 했지만 안돼더라구요! 제가 불쾌한 것은 사장님이 골프황제 타이거우드가 계란후라이에 건강상 기름 안넣고 쿡하듯이 음식이 기름없이도 들러붙지 않는 후라이팬이 단돈 $10 이라고 했는데... 왠걸요! 기름없이 계란후라이를 시도했는데 완전 들러붙어 시커멓게 타서 부랴부랴 올리브 기름을 들어 붓고 다 띠어 냈어요! 그리곤 즉시 사기당한 기분이 엄습했죠. 몇 만불을 당해야만 사기가 아닙니다! 단돈 $10불 짜리도 거짓방송과 거짓광고면 범 소비자를 대상으로 한 사기입니다!!!
과연 사장님은 이 후라이퍈으로 직접 달걀후라이 해 보시고 광고하시는지요?? 방송국 아나운서님들은요? 해 보셨다면 그렇게 교민들께 거짓광고 해선 안됩니다. 임자 제대로 만나면 소송 들어갈 수도 있슬겁니다.
좋다는 경옥고도 믿고 3통을 샀는데 딸려온 액기스까지 이것도 사기 아닌지... 후라이팬 때문에 홈쇼핑월드 물건들 전체가 불신을 줄 수 있다는 걸 사장님은 아셨으면 합니다!
참고로, 광고는 많이 들어서 기대를 갖고 방문한 생전 처음 “홈쇼핑월드”에서의 Shopping 이였어요! 완전 실망입니다!<//Review>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) The red ginseng store was closed and I stopped by home shopping LA. If the price of red ginseng is 119 dollars for 30 bags, it's a very expensive price.

<review>Dropped by this establishment today to look at a replacement koi. This place sells real Japanese koi. You can yell from the shape of the body and the bright color pattern. And of course, the prices are much higher than the ones you find in regular store. For a 6" koi, the price is $85.00 and the price will go up based on the size and the species of koi. Oh, they also sell aquatic plants, fish foods, koi ponds equipments, and etc. I suggest you call ahead and make an appointment because some of their kois need to be "quarantined" before they will sell them to you. I was told I need to go back next week to pick up the fish I chose.<//review><Rating>5</Rating><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJSPyAgOvYAlAZfVxoCQCCMn7Vsu93Jdr5IQmR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAcZw-NpbkkwHREn6fTe-SO2nqE_HmCartOB_N=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7or9DGoP1eA8GaZhlC0cjQ78ahTbYa393iQzj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMokI52dF9MiwEcZdWRNeLXJfqhiKa6szDWebyX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2ySF1jhv-a9Kw-gvDauBfRsCjA6OlWf5BpAc3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><UserId.>113288768609209677779<//UserId.><time>1614232217248<//time>< Gmap_id>

If you want beautiful and healthy koi then East Bay Koi is the place to go!  Kevin is extremely helpful, knowledgeable, and patient as it took hours to decide which koi to purchase because each fish stands out in their own unique way. The koi at East Bay koi are not run-of-the-mill pet shop koi, but if you’re wanting authentic Japanese koi that are undeniably some of the best then East Bay Koi is the place to go!  See Kevin.</Text>

<Text>I visited East Bay Koi to look at Tosai Koi. The place is fantastic, clean, & organized. Kevin attended to us & patiently fished out our selections to appreciate up close. Take your time, he said, so we felt no pressure & he waited on us even if we changed our selections 2x!
I bought 4 kois & some fishflakes. Very enriching experience we had!
I’m definitely going back for more! Thanks!< /Text>< Pictures>

Such a kind beautiful family owned business. I came in met the son he taught me and my daughter about Koi and how they keep them and we met their sweet dogs. He let us hang out and it was such an experience for my daughter. I brought my family back the next week finally we settled on three goldfish they were so kind and educated me on how to make sure I had the proper tank size and water, I have always had bad luck with animals but bc how the family at East Bay Koi took the time to educate me our three fish are thriving. I love this place love this family love this business and will continue to support for years to come and I hope you do too!<//Text>

<Review>Best Koi shop in the bay, prices ranges are based on Koi fish size. They have an assortment of colors, some colors have different meanings. They also have services like weekly/monthly pond maintenance packages and fish doctor services and treatments. If you dont have a pond? no problem, they can work that out too. If your Koi has a colorless patch, a weird bubble growth or even floating Koi, let them take care of it. Don't let your Koi float like me, they are too big to flush. Get the right help people dont learn the hard way. Love this place.</Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<text>Each time I visit EB Koi, I find that I can stay there forever. The space feels very tranquil. The owner is super knowledgeable about pools, tanks, fishes and aquatic plants. NOT only that, even though the price seems daunting at first, they're actually cheaper and better quality elsewhere. For example, I wish I had bought their rubber pond liner before building out my pond with products from Home Depot. Their stuff is more durable, customizable and pretty much the same cost with the bonus of expertise advice. Also, aquatic plants here are great quality since the owner is so passionate about them and takes great care of them. I highly recommend EB Koi. Also, they're dog-friendly (if your dog is sweet like mine!!! ;).</text><Response>{'time': 1593183210106, 'text': 'Thank you Catherine! We appreciate your kind words and for your support.

<Time>1540253423476<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I went in looking for goldfish. They currently had just a handful as they are primarily dedicated to Koi (Andy gave me a couple of referrals). I was very impressed with their selection and quality of large Koi. To the best of my recollection their Koi are exclusively Japanese. The fish are kept in large permanent pools the filtration and care is quite obvious and reflected in the quality of health and size of the fish. This type of care comes at a cost that may be prohibitive for the beginner, or casual fish keeper. Having said that they are super friendly and helpful. Definitely, worth a visit especially if you want to be inspired or educated about the elevated forms of this hobby.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>{'time': 1543858799925, 'text': "Thank you again for visiting us, Carmelo!

This is a family business.  Everyone there is knowledgeable and helpful.  There are no salespeople just going through the motions; the staff clearly cares about providing service to the customers.

In contrast to some aquarium shops that feel a little seedy, ill-kempt, and musty, this shop is spotless and fresh.

And, the fish are beautiful.  The supplies are high quality.  I wouldn't shop anywhere else for pond needs.<//Review>

<text>East Bay Koi has a wide selection of Koi fish that will not disappoint! If you're starting out and want to something to grow old with, take a look at their selection of young Koi. However, if you're looking to add to the collection, they also have fairly large, grown Koi for your pond as well! Stop by and satisfy your curiosity! Staff is very knowledgable!< /text></record>

My favorite place in the San Francisco Bay Area to buy Japanese Koi Fish! Huge variety of colors and sizes, 100% imported from Niigata, Japan. One thing I really like is that each pond is labeled with the Japanese Farm they're originating from, so you know exactly where your Koi is coming from! This is a family business and everyone was very welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable! Great place to bring friends or family to!<//review>

<review>I have visited East Bay Koi on several occasions and have always received wonderful service, I d not have the owners name assisted me, but he is professional and very knowledgable in regards to Koi. I have purchased maybe 4 Koi from him over the past 3 years and all were and still are healthy and beautiful. Would recommend East Bay Koi to anyone looking to purchase or get more information about raising Koi.< /review></record>

< Review>
My bf and I had a great first-time experience at EBK today. We were greeted by Lily, the shop dog. Lily was well-behaved and very friendly. The owner, Kevin, was helpful, knowledgeable, and patient. After an hour of scanning for the "perfect" fish, we picked-up a Doitsu Platinum Ogon and Chagoi (recommended by Kevin). Both fish are very friendly, which is an important trait to us. In about a month from this review, EBK's bringing in new fish from their quarantine tanks, so we'll be returning soon. Hopefully, we can find a Yamabuki Ogon and/or Asagi, to our liking, at our next visit.

We highly recommend EBK!</Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>I’m considering building a small koi pond in my back yard, and East Bay Koi is the only name that poped up when I search for a koi shop near where I live. I stopped by the shop with just the intention of learning about the costs and different things that I need to consider before building one and not buying anything right away. The owner, however, was still extremely helpful knowing that I was not gonna buy anything that day. He was very knowledgable about koi and pond constructions and offered me a lot of great advice. The shop is very clean and organized. Their inventory consists of many different kois imported directly from breeders in Japan. My overall experience with the shop is very positive, and I will definitely be back when I’m ready to build my own pond. A bonus point for those of you who loves dogs out there, they have a super cute Schnauzer at the shop who serves as a guard dog!</text>< username>

Miguel was awesome!  He solved the problem, made sure I was kept informed of any progress, and helped me navigate my extended warranty. This dealership has never disappointed me. Everyone has always been honest and helpful. Thanks again Miguel!< /text>

<Text>I am extremely disappointed in the service department at this dealership. I had an appointment and upon my arrival, I had to wait 15 minutes for someone to speak to me. Once they did, the person that "helped" me was completely unhelpful. He insisted on having my oil changed when that was NOT the reason I took my car in. Once I explained the reason for my visit, the tech proceeds to tell me that I would have to leave my car for a day or more to have it looked at. LOOKED at! Not to repair a problem once it was found but only to be looked at. When I asked why, he explained that they had a lot of cars to work on. I then ask what the point is of scheduling an appointment and he started to try to spin some story and I just left. So in essence, all they did was waste my time. I drove from Laguna Niguel, took time off work and was fed nothing but nonsense. I should mention that my other vehicle is a BMW and the difference in service is unbelievable. Hey, service manager, why don't you to one of their dealerships and learn a thing or two about how to treat your clients.</Text>< Pictures>

Unbelievable service and complete satisfaction! Do not shop ANYWHERE else for your next Ford. Inventory is strong even when other dealers are struggling, and the attention you will receive is second to none. Thank you Santa Margarita Ford for making my childhood dream come true with the purchase of my Mach 1!< /Text>

<review>We have been going to Santa Margarita Ford for years!  That is because we have always received exceptional service from all of their employees.  However, I must give a special shout out to customer rep, Miguel, who has gone above and beyond for me on many occasions.  He always keeps me updated on the status of my car, recalls and my extended warranty.  Best yet, he always does it with a smile!  Thank you Miguel as well as the rest of the team at SMF!< /review>< Pictures>

<name>Jennifer McClay<//name><Time>1613251273573< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I absolutely love Santa Margarita Ford and would recommend to anyone.
A little over a year ago I came to this dealership to look for a car that would provide a bit more space, since my kids are involved in sports we really needed more leg room, and truck space.
Before I came here, I always had very painful experiences with dealerships. I’d get haggled, feel pressured, pushed to make a deal and made to feel as though that was the only deal I’d be able to get, etc. BUT when I came to SM Ford, the experience was quite the opposite.
I’ve always been told to never ever go alone to a dealership because I’ll get a bad deal...and they may be true for some places but not here. I walked onto that lot with my 2 kids in tow, and we were not pushed, or pressured at all from the moment we arrived. I was listened to, treated with respect and patience. The people I worked with related to me, treated me with fairness and worked hard to ensure that I drove off with a great experience and with the perfect car.
I can honestly say, I don’t think I ever want to go anywhere else. I’ll be directing all my friends and family there, and be going back if I ever want to get another vehicle! Oh—their service department is great as well!</Text>< pics>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I had a very positive experience. They follow up, as good sales people do, but they don't keep pressing you so I didn't feel pressure. They led with good terms, rather than a "quote high, watch them buy" mentality, and I felt good about the terms I agreed to. They gave me space to look at and consider different options, rather than direct me in any way. Everyone was courteous and responsive. Getting in and out with my new car was stress-free and didn't take a ton of time. I would definitely recommend this dealership to friends and family.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1615229978452, 'text': 'Hi Jason, it gives us great pride knowing that you felt comfortable with our staff and that your visit here was an enjoyable one!

I had my first service on my Ford Escape 2020.  My service rep is Duane Litz. He got my car in right away and it was done under the estimated time. When I picked my car up it was washed and cleaned and looks brand new. Also I was having some issues on how to work some of the features on the car. So one of the reps name George sat in the car with me explained everything. The next day I had an issue with the hood on my car with some marks that were not their fault but mine. I took my car in and talk to George and he brought Duane out to my car and within minutes they had it buffed out and I was on my way. The service there is outstanding and I’m very happy with it. I would certainly buy another car and recommend Rancho Santa Margarita Ford. Kelly 🚗💨<//Text>

The employees were super friendly and helpful. The only issue I had was that I had to wait an hour and a half just to get my car battery tested and to put a new battery in, and no one updated me on the progress of my car until I went up and asked them. I understand car dealerships can be really busy in their service department, it just would’ve been nice to know the time frame a head of time. They did give me a complimentary car wash, so that was great.< /Review>

<text>Who here has bought a vehicle and spent hours waiting... negotiating... buying accessories... having your kids whine they are hungry. Been there... and I can tell you working with Robbie Moore the experience was far from the one described. If you want to deal with a straight shooter... no nonsense... he got my paperwork to me... I did it almost all online. When I got to the dealer he already had the truck washed, waiting out front... I even bought the truck and relied on his description and FaceTime video. His description was perfect and the truck was BETTER than he had described. If you want a new experience with a car dealership... give Robbie a call at Santa Margarita Ford. I was done in 30 min and had the keys to my new car!< /text>< userid>

I have purchased 2 cars myself and one family member as well in the year 2020.  The staff, especially RC in finance has been easy to work with.  They have been fair in their pricing negotiations. The showroom and lot are always clean and the service area has been easy to work with as well.< /review>

I ended up talking with Dan Hernandez about the best deals on the used lot. Then before I made it across the sales floor, there was a seemless handoff to Brandon. I felt like the most important guy in the store and Brandon basically sold me a car without "selling me" on a car. I NEVER buy a car on the first visit to a dealership, but somehow I did this time, with zero buyers remorse. That sale would have normally not happened on that night. Big ups to Dan and ESPECIALLY Brandon.<//text>

Santa Margarita Ford dealership is truly amazing. The entire staff is professional and friendly. I purchased my Raptor from SM Ford and Eric Habermehl the Sales Manager, Sales Associate Skye Saab and Ramon RC Cabral the Finance Manager truly made it the best vehicle purchase experience that I've ever had.

It was the most relaxing vehicle purchase that I've ever made and I've purchased numerous vehicles in my lifetime. The entire dealership staff is professional and friendly and very acomidating to the customer needs. So if your researching dealerships to purchase a vehicle and to service your vehicle you will absolutely be amazed in choosing SM Ford in Rancho Santa Margarita, California.

Always efficient service.  I bought my car here.  I make an early appointment and they finish in an hour and a half while I wait.  Been doing this for 5 years.
2021-bought a used car from Shift and Sirius XM wouldn't connect.  Took it in and they diagnosed with no charge.  Now to get Shift to take care of the $1,000 repair which they seem to be on top of.< /text>

<Text>We bought a second vehicle from this dealership because they have always taken such great care of our family. The service department is excellent. The sales dept is friendly and helpful but never pushy. We absolutely LOVE working with Robbie. He is retired military, really knows the vehicles and is willing to do whatever it takes to make sure the customers get the vehicle they need regardless of whether they go thru him or another dealership. We plan to purchase a third vehicle from him soon. He treats us like family everytime he sees us at the dealership dropping off our vehicle for schedule service.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1609962456150, 'text': 'Hi Christina, it gives us great pride to know that you always receive the service that you deserve.

Just purchased an expedition from sm ford and am very delighted. Michael, the new guy from chicago helped my wife and I out and we appreciate him very much, as well as the rest of the team. I literally locked all three keys in the car within 2 hours of buying the car trying to set up a new code for the keyless entry and calls right before closing on Sunday and R.C. was able to run the VIN and get the stock code. I literally just waxed my beautiful new car, I was three beers deep and the car was parked half in and out of my garage... So I appreciate the help and the new car, and the trade in, and the service department for help on my other ford's.<//text>

{'time': 1611595837023, 'text': 'Hello Mr. Sherby, First off, I apologize to you if you feel that I did not properly explain to you the power steering issues that your vehicle had when I met with you and your wife in person last week. I did in fact process the reimbursement request and you should have the check by now as I did authorize it when your wife sent me the receipts. In regards to the Flex’s power steering issues the vehicle was brought into us for a power steering leak. We inspected the vehicle and found that the rack and pinion were leaking profusely and there was a lot of fluid everywhere. We replaced the rack and pinion and purged the system followed up by a road test. When we were contacted about the troubles you experienced on the road trip, we promptly addressed them when the car was in our possession. I also authorized the reimbursement on the inspection the independent did in Mammoth. Due to the fact that parts for your vehicle are extremely limited due to age, I authorized replacing the pump and reservoir after locating both. The reservoir had become restricted and the system was unable to properly burp. There were many fragments and particles and that is why I decided to replace the pump as a pre-emptive measure. I understand that it has been a frustrating experience and again, I apologize. If you would like to discuss this further, I am available to assist you further. Regards, Gina Allen - Director of Fixed Operations - gina@smauto.com - 949-888-4353'}</Resp>

I will NEVER take my Ford to this dealership for service again.  We took the car in because power steering fluid was leaking.  We thought maybe the reservoir had a leak.  The dealership said we need a new kit for the rack and pinion.  They took 3 days and charged $2400.  They released an UNSAFE car to my wife just before our trip to Mammoth (which they knew we were waiting on the car for).  They had delayed our trip.  On our way to Mammoth we discovered that they had not fixed the power steering leak and in fact had made it worse.  We lost control of the power steering in mountain driving conditions and had to keep refilling it.  Meanwhile the power steering was coating the inside of the engine compartment.  I didn't appreciate the fact that when I said to our service manager Duane that they released an unsafe car to us, his response is that we made it didn't we.  To their credit they took the car for another 3 days, figured out that they needed to replace the reservoir because there were fragments in the line and reservoir.  They did clean the engine compartment as requested (although not very well since it still smells like power steering fluid).  I took the car to the Camino Capistrano Ford dealership and they replaced the cabin filter which helped with the Power Steering odor .  They said they would reimburse us for the mechanic we paid up in Mammoth but I'll be surprised if the actually do.  We bought our car from this dealership but I strongly suggest you don't use their service department.  It is the worst!</review>

We texted and he offered a price for a Ford Edge that my wife and I were happy with. A few days later my wife showed up to purchase the car and was given the deal that was already promised. Robbie Moore was great at making sure the process didn't waste anytime and later texted to apologize for any delays.

5 Star Experience with Cory Sweeney at Santa Margarita Ford. He made the process a breeze, which is not always the case when buying a car. His communication was spot on, making sure to keep us updated with texts and calls. He explained the entire process. Zero surprises. The inventory was great, the show room and waiting rooms are giant and very clean. Very friendly team, from finance to manager Jason. 5 Star experience. Would highly recommend.</Text>

< Review>
The tough part was deciding which make and model of pickup I wanted to buy.  Once I landed on a Ford Raptor, choosing the dealership was easy!  I have heard so many great things about Santa Margarita Ford over the last 20+ years that I knew this was the only place to go.

Sales manager Jason Saling, Finance Manager Dave Franco and Sales Rep Skye Saab treated me like a king, were very efficient, friendly, knowledgeable and professional every step of the way.  The team that the Graham family has assembled here is so impressive.  In the high-turnover auto dealer industry, people come to work at Santa Margarita Ford and stay!  Most I met have been with the store 10 to 30 years!  Impressive!  That means the same person will be there to help you throughout your ownership experience!</Review>

{'time': 1599849665313, 'text': 'Dear Kevin Torio,\nI’m very sorry to hear about your experience with our Service Department. It certainly isn’t our intention to inconvenience our customers, but it sounds like we did just that. From your review it’s unclear if you were able to repair the seat panel issue. Given the opportunity, perhaps we can help out with that in the future if it hasn’t been addressed already. Life has certainly been challenging lately, and I’m afraid that your experience was an unfortunate by-product of the general confusion given the pandemic, Ford Motor Company’s own struggles (especially with parts), and our own internal communication breakdowns. Sal is relatively new to the position, but I’m confident he meant you no ill-will. He’s a nice young man that works very hard.\n\nI would like to address your ending comment about discrimination. We take these sort of allegations VERY SERIOUSLY. I would invite you to contact me personally to discuss your concerns further. My email is james@smford.us and my direct phone line is 949.709.6033. I apologize again about your experience and welcome any further thoughts you have about your interaction with our staff.\n\nStay safe and all the best,\nJames Graham\nGeneral Manager\nSanta Margarita Ford'}</resp>

<review>Update (as of 09/17):
Gina was able to reach out to me today, and I finally felt that my concerns were finally addressed. When she first called me and identified herself from RSM Ford, I have to admit that I was initially annoyed and defensive during our conversation.

However, during that call she allowed me to gain her trust and I was able to express my experiences (the 3 visits so far). I felt that she understood my concerns and she's an excellent active listener.

I mentioned that I have nothing personal against the Service Advisor who (tried to) assisted me, however the customer experience I went through can be greatly improved.

At first, I decided to go have my SUV serviced at RSM Ford due to the convenience factor; it's nice to know that if I wanted to make an appointment, it can literally be done same day (which is kind of unheard of when it comes to other dealerships)!

After talking with Gina to finally air things out, I now do not think discrimination took place; it was just a misunderstanding with the Service Advisor who unknowingly didn't know how to de-escalate situations.

Gina has restored my faith in this dealership, and I may give them another chance during my next service visit. If this momentum continues, I may seriously consider SM Ford for my next vehicle purchase (hopefully the new Bronco within the next 2 years).

Because of Gina, I'm updating their rating from 1 to 4 stars.
-----------------------------------------------------

Review is for the Service Department...

A few months ago, I recently leased a 2020 Explorer ST from another Ford dealership. I currently live in Lake Forest, and the dealership I leased it from is in Orange (closed to where I used to live).

Since Santa Margarita Ford is my nearest dealership, I decided to take my SUV over here since it seems they're not busy (just calling in for an appointment, I can drop it off whenever).

I visited this dealership 3 times:
1st - Had a hyperblinking issue on the left turn signal that bothered me ($60k for a brand new car having this issue, and wanted to get it corrected). Please note this issue was not resolved by SM Ford, and that I had to have my originating dealer resolve it for me (even though SM Ford knew of the problem, but didn't want to help me since they're stating that it may not be covered under warranty).

2nd - Reverse camera intermittently is non-functional (displays blue screen). Please note that this issue is not currently resolved, but SM Ford technically ignored the problem and told me to wait for recall notice. I got my originating dealership involved, and they are ordering me a new reverse camera.

3rd - Broken seat panel caused by my second visit to SM Ford. During that visit, I noticed upon picking up my car that the power driver seat panel was slightly hanging. I briefly dismissed the issue because I thought the mechanic had to go under the seat (for reasons unknown) and forgot to clip the cover back on. Flash forward a week later when I cleaned my card, and discovered that a plastic clip was actually broken. Mentioned it to my Service Advisor and he misled me regarding the timeline (initially said the part will come in later that week, but upon my follow-up call today he's now stating the end of this month).

My overall experience at Santa Margarita Ford has been very negative, including the broken seat panel issue. I'm writing this review because I just got off the phone with SM Ford's Service Advisor (please note that I had to call because he hasn't been following up with me), and he now states that the part in question is on backorder and they should expect an update by the end of the month. Very non-confident on his part. By that point, I expressed my frustration to him, and even called him out on excuses he's been stringing me along to.

I just gave up at this point, and called my advisor at the Orange dealership regarding the broken seat issue that SM Ford caused, and he told me to bring it in and will take care of it for me...<//review>< userid>

I don't normally write reviews but Michael was amazing to work with and deserves a shout out. We went back and forth for a couple of weeks (I'm very indecisive) and he took his time to answer any and all questions. Once we decided on a vehicle we were in and out within an hour. Was very impressed with their level of service and HIGHLY recommend you buying your next Ford from Michael! :)< /Review>

<text>As a return loyal patron, I have always valued the quality and reliability of the service performed on my 2013 Ford F150 crew cab 4x4 by the service team at Rancho Santa Margarita Ford. Gina Allen, Director of Fixed Operations and Miguel Aparicio, Assistant Service Manager made sure that I was satisfied with my experience and went the extra mile as they always do. I had one recall, a major 100k mile tune up and complete fuel system induction cleaning, oil change, full vehicle inspection and tire rotation and the service provided by the team went well and repairs are guaranteed for 24 months. I highly recommend RSM Ford for both sales and service and will always be a loyal customer of this fine establishment. The individuals who are employed here are kind, courteous,  knowledgeable and professional.
Thank you!<//text>< pictures>

We had an excellent experience at Santa Margarita Ford. Cory Sweeney helped us find the right car, a 2019 Ranger. He was very transparent through the whole process and made me confident that we made the right choice. RC helped us with our financing and did a great job explaining everything for us. Thanks to the sales team for making our first car buying experience a positive one!<//text>

<text>Went to nearly a dozen different dealerships. I don’t leave negative reviews typically, but a lot of those other dealerships would get them if I did. Santa Margarita Ford was amazing to work with, straight forward, didn’t try to hide any fees or sell me anything I didn’t need. I told them what I wanted and they made the deal work. I would refer anyone looking for a car to them.</text>< Pictures>

Had a great experience at this location.  We had our eye on a van and it was well priced.  A few days later I headed over to test drive it.  Lisa helped me out and was really nice.  I was up front about not being interested in buying that day and the dealership wasn’t pushy (a major plus in my book).  Came back to check the car out a second time with my husband and was helped by Eric.  Paid cash and was impressed by our experience.  Fast service.  Not pushy.  Would definitely do business with them again.  Thank you again Eric, Lisa and the guy in finance (so sorry, I can’t recall your name!!!).  You all were fantastic!<//text>

Any time I go for service here, I get the worst attitude and customer service. The employees ignore you and make you wait while they are having personal conversations. The woman who I think is the service manager is obnoxious and rude, always acting as though you are a burden. I've taken my car here for years and I will not be coming back. When you bring your car in for service, you expect to be treated nicely. This place does the opposite.</review>

<Text>I had a good experience at Santa Margarita Ford. I stumbled upon the exact truck I was looking for online, it was at this dealer. I called and was put in-touch with a very friendly salesman who owned the same truck himself, named Drazen. I worked out a time to come down and check out the truck. When I showed up, they had parked the exact truck at the main entrance of the building and it had already been detailed inside and out. I got a very good vibe from Drazen, and the dealership as a whole. The deal on the truck was fair, we were in and out very quickly. My wife and I are very happy with our truck, and our entire experience with Santa Margarita Ford. Thanks again Drazen!</Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNOBEXgjl40pMgi-ppJhoPtzK4otTaKYzOPQRRn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkrj1HjfficuKjeK1ceYQNam94BKnX-SraxPc4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXYW4brsOG3DU3v3ottU3zi9DGe-ztsStMYeqa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< response>

It was an absolute pleasure buying a truck from Santa Margarita Ford. The process was simple and we got a great deal. James, Dan and Dave were fantastic to work with. We’ve serviced our vehicle there in the past and that’s always a breeze. We are completely happy with our purchase and highly recommend this dealership!</text>

From our 1st contact with him for this last purchase,  we contacted him, got a price back within a 1/2 hour and went down to pick up the truck within 3 hours. No haggling no games just an honest price and a easy process.
I have and will continue to recommend Dan for any one who wants to buy a vehicle from the fleet department, thanks again Dan for making it happen.</text>

<user_id>100467998676189748301< /user_id><Review>Home of the surprise fees. I TWICE asked for a full list of fees. One of the conversations was even with the salesman and manager. I was never sent a list, but told by the manager of “all” the fees and assured that was everything. A couple days later, I again asked the salesman if there were ANY other fees I need to be aware of. Nope. I was traveling to California from another state to buy the car and while our way to the airport, I was sent a written list of all costs. Sure enough, a new fee. I asked what this fee was, and was told he would chase that down. A few minutes later, I was texted yet another mystery fee. I expressed my concern with the blatant disregard for any of our previous conversations and told them I’m heading to the airport to buy your vehicle - but I’m not paying any of these new fees. Then came my favorite line, “Sorry, nothing we can do.” After making it very clear I’m not paying any new fees they conjure up, they removed one fee but not the other. I don’t know if this is intentional or incompetence, but I’m certain the fees would’ve just keep appearing. So I walked away.<//Review>< pics>

<review>To start with, I’ve never found the process of buying a car to be all that enjoyable.  I have physical pain issues that effect my daily life.  Sitting for long periods and standing can cause back and leg spasms.  Needless to say, the number one most important feature on any car I drive will come down to how comfortable the seat is.  I relayed the importance of this to Cory Sweeney, (salesperson) who sold me my new Ford Edge ST when I arrived that day.  He asked me a few other important questions right away to better service my needs.  I appreciated the way he went about narrowing down the process for me by simplifying it.  What’s my price range?  How big of car do you need?  Do you want leather or fabric interior etc?...After a minute or so, he had me ready to test drive the Ford Edge ST and the Ford Edge SEL.  But before he went inside the dealership to grab the keys, Cory asked how I was doing and if I’d like a water or something to drink.  He directed me to a shaded area near the entrance w/a table and bench where I could sit for a moment while he retrieved the car keys for me to test drive the Edge ST first.  I think Cory must have known this would be the car for me so he wanted me to test out the seat and compare it against the Edge SEL seat.  After driving both cars, the ST won me over!  Cory made the rest of the transaction as smooth as possible.  He hustled all day and made it happen on my end by finding me a couple great discounts that I could use to bring my final price down.  It’s clear that Cory’s there to get the deal done for you!  When people ask me where I bought my Edge ST (and they will 😉), I’ll be telling them to go see Cory at Santa Margarita Ford!!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<Text>Choose SM Ford on a recommendation when we bought our Escape Hybrid. Worked with John Hadden and loved the fact that he made us aware of other deals going on with the Edge, Explorer, etc even though we had come in specifically for the Escape. No pressure on which car make or model to choose from. John has also made sure to stay in regular contact with us to make sure our car experience continues to be a good one. Have had basic maintenance service done and it has always been a worry free and easy process. Would highly recommend you check out SM Ford. Great community business partner as well.

Update 4/28/21

So I write my original review 2 years ago and just finished another emergency car issue with SM Ford and Miguel. My hybrid car started having starting issues and I knew because of the complexity of an old hybrid car I didn't trust anybody else to correctly diagnosed the issue. Miguel and his team once again came through for me and was able to resolve and fix my issues at a fraction of the cost I thought I would need to pay which is a complete hybrid battery replacement. Locations at different times and the fact that Miguel always gives me options versus a one-fix solution which is a great way to earn my trust versus thinking of being taken on the money grab. Thanks Miguel and Santa Margarita Ford for another great service and fixing my car and not forcing me to buy a new one!</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

I can’t say enough AMAZING things about Robbie Moore and the incredible staff at Santa Margarita Ford. We had a very special circumstance and Robbie made the entire process stress free and speedy. He actually WANTS you to get the absolute best deal on your next vehicle, an experience that is such an anomaly these days at most car dealerships. I would recommend him and Santa Margarita Ford to anyone; I honestly mean that. Thank you again SMFord!< /Review>

Best car leasing experience we've ever had! My husband and I were bummed to find out our previous car salesman (who we really liked) from another dealership left with no forwarding info so I immediately jumped on Yelp to see if I could find some good reviews and I'm so glad I did.

Special shoutout to ALL the people who wrote about their positive experience with Robbie Moore! The great reviews are no joke, he is as good as it gets. No sales pitch, down to earth, easy going, friendly, he was genuinely interested in getting us the deal we wanted and he totally took care of us like we were family. I would call him the "anti-salesman" because he is nothing like your typical car salesman.

Our lease was not expiring for another month so we didn't intend to buy a car the day we went in to meet him but he made us a deal we couldn't refuse and ended up leaving with the car we wanted and a lower payment.

If you want to have a great car buying/leasing experience ask for Robbie, he's the man!

I also want to add that Brian Carpenter in financing was awesome to work with as well. Really personable and made the paperwork process a breeze.< /text>

<review>SKYE and RC were great to us when buying a Ford Explorer. We went to another dealer and got a completly different terrible experiance. We drove 1.5 hiurs to come test drive with Skye and he was very nice. We loved how he was outright honest from the beginning about everything. He was able to tell us everything we wanted to know. When we met the Service Manager we knew we were going to have a great experiance from this dealership, we cant remember his name but we would have loved to shout him out. We came in to get the exact payment we were looking to get for the exact car we wanted. The Finance Manager also gave us the same kind of friendliness and professionalism that it was easy to talk to him! All together, I would reccomend this Ford over any others to anyone.<//review>< Pics>

I purchased a 2017 Ford Mustang from a different Ford dealer. Within 7 months, I noticed a noise coming from the transmission and differential when shifting in and out of park. I called the dealer in an attempt to get it fixed under warranty and they advised me of a wait time of over two months. Instead of waiting two months, I went with Santa Margarita Ford due to its proximity to my home. I called in at 7am, right when they opened on a weekday. They scheduled me to come within an hour. I brought in my car and spoke to Miguel in the services department. He told me the issue would be looked into the same day. I left my car with the dealership and five hours later received a phone call from Miguel stating the problem was identified and could be fixed overnight. I agreed to the overnight service and picked up my car the very next day. Everything was covered under warranty and the process was completely smooth and painless. After my great experience here, I realized I should have went to Santa Margarita Ford before buying elsewhere. Highly recommended.</text>

I know that the repair process on your vehicle has been lengthy due to the complexity of the body work that had to be done. After I spoke with you yesterday, I mentioned that I will be more than happy to reimburse you for the window tint to repair the scratches on the rear window tint. If it is easier to have us handle the tint, we will provide you with a loaner vehicle while your vehicle is in our shop. After some further research I found why we were unable to locate the service file this past Saturday. We mistakenly made an error with the vehicle identification number and have remedied that in your vehicle history. I sent you a copy of this yesterday.

Tony went above and beyond to make the buying experience as pleasurable as possible.  We brought our 3 kids with us, he was so great and patient with them.  There is even an area for kids to play and hang out while you wait.  There was a missing key fob to our vehicle and Tony personally drove it to our house when they found it.  We were very pleased and satisfied with our experience & would definitely use them again.<//Text>

I've done business with them many times over the years, but not recently.  I was very pleased to discover many of, the same staff continues to work at this agency, and that is very unusual in today's marketplace.  I worked closely with Scott ( salesperson ) and Ellen ( Sales Manager ) to explore my options and the pricing.

SM Ford had the car I wanted in stock.  I had performed ample research and several other companies gave me written quotes.  The ultimate price I paid, and the trade in I received, is competitive with the best offers presented.  I am the pleased owner of a new car, and I have the assurance when I experience the normal issues present with today's advanced technology, the staff here will take care of my needs pleasantly, effectively, and in a timely manner.

I have recommended this company to friends and family many times.  On follow-up, my referrals report a professional attitude presented by all of the staff, and satisfaction when they ultimately reach a deal on a vehicle they are seeking.  I would encourage anyone to reach out to this company to discuss the new vehicle opportunities they offer.  Of course, if its a used car you are seeking, they have some very nice options available.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Text>Very easy car purchase. Walked in they had a used C-Max plug-in hybrid in the showroom for a good price. I am co-borrower on three daughters vehicles and I recently refinanced, so I thought my credit would be an issue. However I drove away with where the well price vehicle, no down ford financing with a good interest rate. Sales representative Dakota was very helpful and made the purchase very easy.</Text>< pictures>

Had an issue with my rear back up camera called in for a quick appointment so they can diagnose it, took my car in and have them check it out. unfortunately due to my work schedule I needed the car by certain time so I called them, they told me that they'll set up an appointment at my convenience so I did. Brought the car back after few days which it will not interfere to my work schedule. Diagnosed was done and they confirmed, KYLE was the service rep. to notify me that they will order the parts and change it. Recieved call again from a rep saying that parts arrived and ready to be install so I went and drop the car, offer me a ride back home. Couple of hours later they called me again saying that my car is done and ready to pick it up. Again they offer me a ride from home to dealer which is a nice courtesy, saw my car parked, fixed the issue and they cleaned it as well. Very satisfied with the service representative!!<//Review>< name>

I really enjoyed my experience with Santa Margarita Ford. I went in on Christmas Eve and was treated very well. Blake took great care in showing me several F-150's till we found just the right one. John was great as well getting through the paperwork quickly and explaining everything. I had to return to get the bed liner installed a few days later and Dwayne in the service department was terrific. Thank you guys! Have a Happy new year.< /review>

As always my experience with the service dept was excellent. Tony is efficient, informative, kind & considerate. It is very comforting to have a representative to handle as well as anticipate your service questions and concerns. His does a fantastic job & I am a very happy customer.
I would also need to mention Cesar, the gentleman Tony arranged to drive me home. Cesar is another feather in the RSM Ford cap. He is professional & courteous. He is fun & maintains a good conversation. It was a joy speaking with him.</review>

Santa Margarita Ford makes everything so easy when it comes to the service center. I recently went to Santa Margarita Ford for a routine oil change and my 30,000 mile service. Miguel Aparicio is simply the best and made sure everything went perfectly with my service. He kept me updated on when my car would be ready and even left my car with the sales floor so I could pick up my car after the service center was closed. If you need any service done on your Ford you should reach out to this dealership and ask for Miguel. As always Santa Margarita Ford goes above and beyond in the customer service area and I am so thankful I have this dealership to go to for service of my car.< /text>

Santa Margarita Ford has been terrific with the sale and service of my new Ford Fusion Hybrid! Professionalism, courtesy and efficiency are all there, and make each of my visits to the dealership an excuse to come back for more.  My new vehicle is wonderful beyond my expectations, and I will continue to entrust it to the service department at Santa Margarita Ford to maintain it that way.</Text>

These guys rock.  I called them at 2:45pm on Sunday.  They had the exact car I was looking for.  Not only did Robbie matched the deal I was looking for over the phone, they provided the best car buying experience I have had when I got there.  I let them know I was on a tight schedule and I was going to be there by 3:15pm, and needed to leave by 4:30pm.  Robbie and John the finance manager had me out of there by 4:30 with the exact car I wanted and the price I wanted.

Kudos to Robbie and John and the whole team for making it happen so fast.< /Text>

We purchased a 2011 Ford Explorer last week from Santa Margarita Ford. From beginning to end, our customer service was top notch. We were not a slam-dunk sale, as we had some non-negotiable parameters, and preferences for our new car. Our salesperson, Scott, and the sales manager, Ellen, worked closely with us for about a month prior to our purchase to ensure that we got the car that was exactly right for our family of 5. The financing paperwork went smoothly and efficiently. Post-sale, there were a few repairs that needed to be made. Ellen made that transaction very easy, giving us another Explorer to drive for the day, and even detailing our car before we got it back. We had an overall terrific experience and highly recommend Santa Margarita Ford.<//Text>

My experience at Santa Margarita Ford was fantastic. We used Costco pricing and got the deal that we really were hoping for. Sales staff was really helpful and the finance guy was easy to work with too. driving the truck off the lot was a dream. We got everything that we liked and wanted and there was basically no pressure at all. They also were really good at identifying all of the features and functionality on the truck and I would shop there again and recommended buying a car or truck from Margarita Ford to all my friends and neighbors. I hope the service is as good as the sales. I guess I find out as soon as I take my truck in for its first service. Thanks for all your help<//Review>

The car that i went to Check was nice, and the price too, however i left right of way because the Salesman breath smells like beer,  and his eyes were kind of red, he was more interested on leaving than talking to me, I'm sure he had a long night. that  tells me a lot about professionalism of the business. How sad i really want it to make a deal, i even had an open check from my bank with me.</Review>

Excellent service, the entire service team was exceptional, courtesy, professionalism, knowledge; sense of humor.

< review>
I purchased a certified pre owned 2015 Ford F-150 from Santa margarita Ford only to be dealt with A really bad POS and the extended warranty they sold me was the PORTFOLIO one where I have to take it into Santa margarita only, not any dealer like I was told. The truck is currently at Santa margarita ford with a list of items that are bad and of a safety concern where the safety of my family is put at risk. How was it that this truck was certified preowned? Somebody at this dealer pencil whipped the check off list. First the rear axle housing was leaking, then the tires were bad to where I had to get new ones then the A pimm module went bad, then the rear sliding glass came off because ford did not prime the surface it was glued on, then on two separate occasions two different ignition modules went bad. Then the stereo whet bad to where it was removed and disposed of with my CDs in it. Now it currently has the passenger side turbo going out, the back up sensors are inoperable, the front left axle hub is grinding, when you turn off the truck with the push button it proceeds to start itself up, the 4wd transfer case is grinding, the passenger vanity mirror stays on to where it gets extremely hot and began to melt the plastic cover, the side view mirrors both are stuck and snap when adjusted. I called James Graham and voiced my concerns only to be disrespected! He first offered to take me out of the truck and put me in a new one (more money, loss on my end and all gain on his) when I was blunt and told him I felt as if I got a lemon his response was “let’s just stop there! If it’s a lemon law you’re looking for then speak to an attorney!”. Santa Margarita Ford prides itself and being a customer service giant when in reality all they do is be condescending and disrespectful and lie to you! no different than a typical fly by night used car dealership. Instead of admitting that it may be possible that the truck may have been overlooked, they would rather disrespect you and put you down, Henry Ford himself would be ashamed that this dealer is using his name. Anybody looking to purchase from Santa Margarita ford should stay away!!!! Be warned!!! Be cautious of the warranty offered and don’t trust the certified pre owned BS!

Update 8/29/19 10:55am I was contacted by Gina Allen (Parts and Service Director) of SMF and was told because this review was posted they were not going To no longer work on my truck even though the warranty they sold me was to be repaired at Santa Margarita Ford they are now  refusing to complete the work on my truck because of the negative review and are asking that the rental be returned and I said no I will not return until my truck is repaired and Gina continued to state that she was going to report the rental stolen. I cannot believe that they are willing to throw a tantrum and put me back into an unsafe vehicle without honoring warranty issues because of a bad review and bad actions on their part. This will be a legal matter if they force me back into that unsafe vehicle without being repaired. I will continue to update with fraudulent actions on behalf of Santa Margarita Ford until this matter is resolved correctly.

Update 08/29/19 1:55pm  upon arriving at Santa Margarita Ford I had to wait 20 minutes to speak to Gina about the prior conversation  in which I was told if I did not bring the vehicle back it would be reported stolen and to pick my truck up. She continued to tell me because I wrote the review in a negative light they were no longer going to do any work on the truck and not honor the warranty....because of the review. At this point Gina and James both sat down to talk to me to advise me that because of that review and the fact that I had an opinion negative towards Santa Margarita Ford they were no longer intrested in my business. They both continued to say that I was rude and disrespectful, I asked them why was I disrespectful and James said because I wrote the review. Then towed my truck out of SMF and on to chino ford. Bad business ethics. Beware bad review= your warranty not honored.<//review>

Nothing like football to help make buying a car a little more relaxing. We purchased a lightly used Escape on Sunday from Robbie while hanging out and watching a game. Great experience, great deal and John H made  signing the paperwork quick and painless.</review>

<Text>I saved $1600 over other for ford dealers here in my town and a total of 3000+ off the sticker price., For me it was worth the 2 1/2 hour drive out to Santa margarita ford. Ryan and his team of professionals provided five-star service.
I would recommend this dealership to any of our relatives, friends or anybody to ask about my new Ford.

Thanks Ryan And The Team at Santa Margarita Ford !<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I have been bringing my work truck into Santa Margarita Ford for some time now. I am confident saying I always get great, friendly and most importantly HONEST service! When it was time to upgrade to a new truck, there is nowhere else I would feel comfortable going. I got a fair price for my trade in, a great deal on my new truck and I feel like I was buying a car from a good friend instead of a “car salesman”.   I will never go to another dealership for anything if I can help it and I would gladly tow my vehicles 200miles to get good, honest service. Thank You Santa Margarita Ford for all your help, awesome service, and a car buying experience like I’ve never had before! You guys are #1 in my book!< /review>

I'm originally from another part of Southern California and found my used vehicle on the internet and took a hesitant chance on Santa Margarita Ford. I found myself coming away very satisfied and confident that I got a really an outstanding used vehicle. I think that if you were considering a purchase with Santa Margarita Ford you can feel confident that you will be treated well by the sales staff eager to give you a great experience. I worked with Scott and he was one of the best salesmen ever in my multiple experiences buying a car all over the country. If you are willing to take the chance, you'll come away with a really great deal at Santa Margarita Ford.<//text>

Bought my Focus here last May.  Tom G. made the purchase experience much better than past experiences I have had at other dealerships. He found ways to save me money during the process, spent time going over the features and functions of the car. Have recommended this dealership to others, and will continue to do so.  Took my Focus in this morning for its 2nd service. Staff was very friendly, service was quick. They even washed the car for me when finished with the work. This dealership gets a top rating from me for sure.</text>

Ford sent me a free oil change and $25 off service coupon so this was a good time to revisit the RSM service department.  I made an 8:15 appointment and brought the truck in. The only issue I had was my 1 hour to 1 hour 15 minute promised time stretched into 1 hour and 45 minutes. Other then that the service was free with the coupons and they made reasonable suggestions of other stuff that needed to be done.< /Text>

I recently brought my Ford Explorer in for a warranty issue, Miguel was my service advisor. Miguel's customer service is top notch, he provided me with daily updates on my car, he is very professional, personable and quite funny. I have never used the service department at SM Ford as I have my own mechanic but after the customer service Miguel provided me I will be switching over to SM Ford for service.
Thank you Miguel!

Great job Santa Margarita Ford!

Car buying can be a fun but highly stressful process.The right dealership can make the most of the fun and minimize the stress.  That's exactly what happened at this Ford dealership.

The car was mainly for my wife, and her evaluation process is way different than mine.  Our sales rep, Blake, was awesome. He took both my wife's and my style into account when answering questions and explaining features. We never felt any pressure - we just good product knowledge and a friendly attitude.

Ultimately, we went back 2 to 3 times narrowing down and finalizing our decision.  Each time Blake was as patient as he was on our original visit. Blake then had to source out a few other dealerships to get a Focus with the exact options we wanted and he did so quickly and professionally.

We got a great deal and were able to buy locally (Rancho Santa Margarita), which made it all the better.

John in the Finance and Insurance department also really came through, too.  He significantly beat our pre-approved bank rate (from our credit union). I was also interested in an extended warranty and he presented all the options and also did some extra paperwork when I decided to make some last minute changes.

I'd definitely recommend looking at Ford when you're considering a new car and Santa Margarita Ford is a great place to shop and buy!< /Review>

<text>I came here with my family to look for a truck on the lot. The guy that helped us had no idea what was going on. A few months later I contacted SMF to inquire about getting a new truck. I didn’t end up getting one from this dealership, but was impressed with the level of service that I was given. I’d like to mention Ryan as the person who helped me promptly after I contacted them. Keep up the good work guys.</text></record></dataset><record>

Lj was very good & knowledgeable.  Helped me make my first car purchase.  Made me feel comfortable and not like most salesmen where they pressure you into making a deal right then and there.  He continues to help me out by getting car washes for me.  Very friendly staff, couldn't be happier with my new C-Max hybrid.</Review>

Tom Glockner and Dan Hernandez are AMAZING!! Tom was so knowledgeable and such a nice guy to work to. And now, thanks to these two, we are driving around in the Explorer we wanted! We will definitely be back in the future!

Oh, and on another note.. They have an In and Out basically on their lot. We went for lunch while they were working on our paper work. Came back, signed some stuff, and we were on our way with a new vehicle and full tummies! What other dealership do you know that has an In and Out??< /review>

I have been having a problem with my Trunk Lid staying open when on a slanted drive way. I explained that my wife has the same car but newer and she does not have that problem. I was told there is nothing Ford can due to fix this problem. Pretty bad when you spend $37,000. Dollars for a car and they can't fix a trunk lid from falling on your head!!!<//Text>

㋡ I have always had nothing but the best from the team at Santa Margarita Ford, their Service department is very professional quick and performs honest and quality service assessments and repairs.

Over the years I have worked with Duane, Jeremy and many others in the Service department and every time they have all gone above and beyond to make sure I am shuttled home and back on the road before the day is done.

I once had a problem that I thought was a transition issue but the service team found the problem was a faulty coil pack and spark plug ultimately saving me thousands in transition diagnostics and repair cost.

Thank you to the staff at Santa Margarita Ford.

< Review>
After having a less than positive experience with a Chevrolet dealer in Carson, we drove to Santa Margarita Ford to see if they could help me.
My daughter had purchased a car there and was overwhelmed by how
wonderful they were with her, so I decided to see if they would repeat the experience with me.  Unfortunately, they didn't have a car on the lot that met my requirements, but it didn't end there!  I had to get a car that day so Robbie Moore found the perfect car for me at another dealership, called them and arranged for me to meet with the manager and helped me get an amazing deal.  I live 2 hours away but would not hesitate to return to Santa Margarita Ford next time I need a car.  Mike and Robbie are warm, caring and wonderfully professional.  I was blessed by my experience and you will be too.</Review>

Robbie Moore and John Hadden were very helpful and honest with what they could do to get me in a used Jeep Wrangler.  No hard sell. No salesman pitch, just straight forward purchase of a vehicle.  I highly recommend Rob and John.

Thanks,

The service department always accommodates me quickly upon my phone call to set an appointment or in an emergency. The staff is always polite and answers all my questions and addresses all my concerns without pause, even down to the shuttle drivers are very polite, I can't say enough about them and that's why I gave them five stars< /review>

On Saturday, Oct 26, I brought in my Ford Escape for an oil change.  When I left the dealership I went about 100 feet and my car just stopped.  I called Peter in service and he sent out one of the mechanics.  He checked under the hood and had me restart the car.  It started, so he asked me to turn around and bring the car back.  It quit again before I could get back.  I called and they sent back the mechanic, this time in a car and he pushed me off to the side and he called his supervisor who came out.  They got me back to the dealership and took me home.  They managed to diagnose what was wrong with the car and repaired it and picked me up and brought me back to get my car before they closed for the day. Each time I called Peter, he took care of the situation immediately and I really appreciate it.  Every one of the people I dealt with that day were great.  I bought my car from Santa Margarita Ford and have had all maintenance performed there.  I wouldn't go anywhere else.  Thanks again.</Review>

<Text>Took my new car in for a slight issue with the windshield and took my grandson with me for the ride.  My grandson is in winter baseball and wanted to practice catching fly balls and grounders.  The people at Sana Margarita Ford told us how to get to a nearby part on a walking trail.  As my car was getting serviced, my grandson and I had a great time playing ball.  We went back to the dealer and Charlie gave us and ice cream while we were waiting.  Everybody at the dealership were very nice and made our wait comfortable.
Talk about a family friendly car dealership, this is it.< /Text></record>

I didn't purchase my Ford from this dealership but started taking it here for service due to their hours and location.  I sure made a mistake buying elsewhere.  This place is what keeps me happy, my car beautiful and running like a dream.  I know where I will buy my next Ford.  The guys in Service are the ones that should be getting the commissions - they are the ones that keep you really happy and make the repeat customers!  CHEERS to Dwane.    The Shuttle guys are also awesome!</review>

Not to say it was totally smooth, but after expressing dissatisfaction, the Sales team was responsive and acted quickly to resolve my problem.  I felt I got a fair and reasonable price and the vehicle I wanted without having to compromise.  I look forward to doing future business with Santa Margarita Ford.

<review>Bought a car a year ago and still dealing with them on fixing an issue to correct with the DMV since they did not transfer my personal plates.  After numerous call and emails still getting penalty letters from DMV after a year.  No one takes any ownership of the problem.  Super frustrating as I thought this was a family hometown dealership and I live in the area.     I thought it would great to support the local area businesses however I am now second guessing my decision.  Happy to spend my $$$ somewhere else in the future.<//review>< Resp>

Santa Margarita Ford always delivers in the service department. No appointment works oil change service. I have been very happy with the service and customer service at the dealership.

Thank you,

Yes, intermittent concerns are the most difficult to diagnose and sometimes even when we take components apart it’s impossible to tell if they are the cause of the concern.  I apologize if we left you with the impression that we weren’t interested in finding the problem.  I am happy to have another look at your 2003 Sable to see if we can locate the source of the problem.  Please contact me if I can help.'}</resp>

<review>Did not fix my problem of having the center console sticking i n Park.
I have ordered the parts my self and when they come in, I will find a service group that will take the time to open up the center console to actually troubleshoot the problem...  It could be solenoid or the cable which will allow the shift lever to be removed from park... I had the brake switch replaced for GQ...</review></record>

Jim Wheeler was my salesman and he was absolutely amazing. He worked with me to get financing and to get the car in a timely manner--as well as made sure it had one quick repair before I picked it up. He took the time to show me all of the features in the car and was more than willing to answer any and all questions. Couldn't have asked for better service!

I had a great experience buying a used car at this dealer that I was driving over 45 minutes to do my maintenance there. On November 11 however, they took almost 2 hours to have it ready. Finally Miguel told me that the car was ready but it was going to take 15 more minutes just to wash the car.
When I got my car I noticed the car hasn't been washed. I thought it was not a big deal so I left. When I got home I noticed there was a Crack on my winshield and the maintenance light was still turning on.
I contacted Miguel to tell him about this issue. I went back and he said all the mechanics were getting ready to go home. He tried to turn off the maintenance light but he didn't know how so he sent me to the Toyota dealer. About the Crack on the windshield he said that it was already there and it has been filled before. I knew there was no Crack before so he said they were going to fix it if it hasn't been filled.
I took the car to the Toyota dealer and a glass shop and both told me that the Crack was recent and it has not been filled. I contacted Miguel at the Ford Dealer. He started to make the arrangements to have the windshield replaced but it has been more than 3 weeks now and he only tells me that he is still working on it. I have not seen any paperwork or any indication that they are going to fix it. Once they fix it I will rewrite this review.<//Review>

I bring my Ford in to Duane & Miguel in the Service Dept... they are a great team! I feel confident leaving my car in their hands. I know whatever the problem is, they will take care of it and keep me informed of what's going on with my car. They take the worry out of having my car serviced.<//Text>

<review>I had a 1:15 appointment for an oil change and rear brake replacement. 3 hours later my car was returned with a broken door handle. When I protested and demanded that it be fixed, the service adviser told me that the mechanic said the door handle was broken when he got the car. I said there was nothing wrong with the car door when I first arrived. The service adviser asked me to return the following morning to have the door panel removed and to discuss the problem further.
The next morning I brought the car in. The inside door handle contains a plastic piece inside that broke. According to my research, it is a common problem. My issue was that TWO mechanics had the car and neither of them indicated there was any problem on the service order. Very odd. I agreed to pay for the replacement part--nearly $70 with tax-- and the labor charge was waived.
I was satisfied UNTIL I took my car to an independent mechanic to get an estimate on some maintenance work. The car was parked for over 30 minutes. When the mechanic popped the hood, we discovered the oil level in the car was a full quart and a half LOW. There are NO leaks. I also noticed all the corrosion on both battery posts. The Ford service order specifically stated that the battery posts had been cleaned.
I don't know what is going on with Ford service departments, but what if I had driven to Las Vegas or Palm Springs in this heat after the Ford oil change? If an insufficient amount of oil in the crankcase led to the engine burning out, I'm quite certain I would be told that the engine was burned out BEFORE I brought the car in to be serviced. And why would the mechanic say he cleaned the battery posts when he clearly didn't? A small detail, but it begs the question, what else didn't he do when he was servicing the car and repairing the brakes?
This is the 3rd Ford dealership I have come to for servicing my car, and I am afraid it is the last. I don't object to paying a fair price for honest work, but this is also the 3rd time this particular dealer service department has been deceptive with me. Sorry, third time is a charm.< /review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmapID>

<name>Patrick Stoddard</name><review>I've bought multiple cars from this location and have been completely satisfied with how helpful and friendly everyone is! They are always willing to talk to you and always put the customer first. I myself have owned a Previously Owned Ford Focus Hatchback which ran perfectly and saved my life in a car accident, in which I had to get my new car - a Previously Owned Ford Escape Hybrid which was amazingly priced and looked brand new! I had an issue with its battery and took it in immediately and the Service department was wonderful. They got me right in even though they were closing in 40 minutes and they got the battery replaced before I could even get back from getting In-N-Out (To Go) next door! Great experiences every time!</review>< time>

Waited for shuttle, when 45 min passed I got uber, that's when they pulled out the second shuttle when there were 5 ppl waiting for rides waiting for almost as long as me! When I called to make my appointment the lady in service gave me lip!  They've never washed my car when I bring it in for service! I miss ford of orange they truly knew how to take care of their customers! Will be going to Irvine ford after today!<//Review>

We run two shuttles and one of them got a nail in the tire and was down for a bit. We did utilize Lyft when it was possible and I apologize that our staff gave you attitude about the inconvenience. As I mentioned I am more than happy to reimburse you for the oil and filter change that was done on your vehicle. I will get that processed and sent out immediately.

Old Truck Smog Service.  Santa Margarita Ford has worked on my 1998 F150XLT Triton 4X4 since I purchased it in 2003 and even though it is not one of the new vehicles they still keep it in great shape.  I have always believed in TPM and don't mind servicing this classic twenty year old truck.  Some trucks deserve to be kept in good running shape when it has performed so well in the almost 200,000 miles traveled.
GOOD JOB Service Department!< /Text>

One of the best experiences buying a car at Santa Margarita Ford!  After online research and visiting a local dealership in Monrovia I found the car I wanted, but not the customer service. I was referred to Santa Margarita Ford.  I had a 5-10 minute conversation over the phone with Robin and it was a done deal!  Very professional and quick to get the deal done.  I drove from Pasadena to Santa Margarita and it was the best choice I have ever made.  When I arrived at the dealership, the car was parked out front and ready to drive off.  Between Charlie Pastick and John Hadden they had me off the lot quickly.  Even with a busy Sunday they were both able quick to answer any question we had and did it in a professional manner.

The dealership was very low pressure and more like a friend or family to help you make a wise choice on buying a car.  I will be back Santa Margarita Ford, especially if I can work with Robin, Charlie and John!< /Text>

We had a long time relationship with another dealership but our sales rep retired so we gave Santa Margarita Ford a chance to earn our business. We dealt with Tony Merten in the fleet department and he took care of us from our very first contact. We were provided with pricing and finance options with no hassle or pressure and we easily made a deal we were satisfied with. We had one minor issue after delivery and it was settled quickly and to our satisfaction by General Manager James Graham. Santa Margarita Ford and Tony Merten have earned our future business.< /Review>

<review>Great car purchasing experience. I live in Indio and decided to take the 2 hour drive to Orange County to purchase a vehicle at Santa Margarita Ford. I called Charlie Pastick to inquire about a vehicle on their website and we were able to work out a deal over the phone. After looking a cars at dealerships in my area  I was unable to get the deal I was looking for. Charlie was able to give me a FANTASTIC deal on the car I  had been searching for. He was very pleasant , courteous  and knowledgeable. When I arrived at Santa Margarita Ford he had all the paperwork and car ready for me. I was in and out in no time !! I would highly recommend SM Ford and Charlie if you are looking to purchase a vehicle.  Next time I am in the market for a vehicle I will be purchasing it from them. Thank you Charlie for the best car buying experience I have ever had !!!< /review>< Pics>

I just purchased a Ford F-250 truck from Santa Margarita Ford. The sales staff at the dealership were great. They made the process so easy. I first found the truck online. I emailed a request to find out if it was still available. Susan Grinnan, from online sales, responded within minutes with all the information on the truck.. I set up an appointment and Scott Delabar was waiting for me when I got there and he just made things very simple. The truck was out in the front and he explained everything about it. I recommend Santa Margarita Ford to anyone. The quality of their Customer Service is way above the expected average.< /review>

Robert scheduled us and took care of the intermittent warranty problem that had been going on for quite some time. Transmission hard shifting. Robert got us in and out as promised and had a good attitude.</Review>

I just purchased a Focus ST and the experience was great, from the scheduling of the test drive, to the final signing of the paperwork, and receipt of the keys.

Sales consultant, Charlie Pastick, was extremely helpful and friendly throughout the whole process of vehicle purchase.  Charlie and the sales team worked very hard to find and deliver a vehicle in my color and configuration preference.

Finance manager, John Hadden, completed the process by clearly and concisely explaining all the facets of the paperwork portion and making adjustments to sweeten the deal.

I found everyone, at Santa Margarita Ford, to be friendly and very accommodating to my needs as a customer looking for a new vehicle.  I would highly recommend this dealership, to anyone looking for a new Ford vehicle.< /text>

Almost every time I've had to bring my car into the service center, I've immediately had problems with it out of the lot. I originally went in to have my car checked out after a long journey, as I did not want to find myself Found On Roadside Dead on the 5 or 405, and they performed an update and serviced my car. Next day, I found myself dead on the 405 and had to be towed, which I had to foot the bill despite the service being the cause of the transmission failing, as they did not perform the update correctly. They did replace for no cost, but it was more than a bit frustrating that the reason I came in was my worry of that happen, only to happen because the update was not done right by the servicing.

This trend would continue almost each visit I would make here. I would go to the shop, and then next day immediately have troubles with the car. Go to servicing to have it checked out and repaired, next day get notice it needs servicing, again, despite me going in to make sure everything was ok. Have to take my car in, turns out clutch needed to be replaced. After they completed it they pulled the car up, and while sitting in the servicing section with one of the servicing reps, and it made a loud, very very hard to ignore screech and clunk. You could see it in the rep's eyes that he was upset as well when it happen, knowing that I've had issues every time I came there.

Miguel has continued to provide good service as a rep reaching out, updating me, calling me to check up and make sure things are ok, but the actual mechanics and techs continue to provide poor service, letting not only me, but him and the team down over and over.< /text>

After failing a smog check, my girlfriend, Jaclyn, and I went to Santa Margarita Ford, to secure parts for her 2003 Ford Escape.  We met with Hector of the Parts Department and showed him the smog check report.  He immediately knew what parts we needed and was, effectively, very helpful in contributing to a passing smog check.  Once again, we thank you so much for you help, Hector!< /review>

<review>My mother and her friend recently purchased a 2015 Ford Transit Connect, and the service here was truly excellent. Drazen -- our salesman -- was informative, engaging, and most importantly, not pushy. And John Hadden -- the finance guy -- was similarly pleasant. His help was instrumental in navigating us through the financial aspects of the purchase.

Based on the great service of these two gentlemen, I'd definitely recommend this dealership to a friend.</review>< Rating>

Just bought a Felix and had a great experience! They were willing to work with me to get a deal that worked. The Felix is in great condition and a certified pre-owned which gives me peace of mind. David Olender was patient with all my questions and followed up with my in a timely manner. He even followed up with me a couple times since my purchase to make sure we are happy! I think that is awesome customer service. Everyone there was kind and friendly and there was no pressure to take a deal that wouldn't work for me. I will definitely recommend my friends and family to purchase from Santa Margarita Ford.<//Text>

Peter Dore was awesome!  We ordered our truck and he kept us up to date on its progress and made sure we got exactly what we wanted. Costco pricing made us feel great about getting a fair deal, then Peter found us some additional savings!

I recently took my 2013 Ford Fusion to be serviced at the RSM Ford.  Peter was friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  The service was completed within a few hours of dropping it off.  Thanks so much for the quick, reliable, and friendly service RSM Ford.  I will continue to bring my Fusion to this location for all needed services.<//Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9</Gmap_id><Rate>3<//Rate><review>I connected with the Santa Margarita Ford Internet Dept and asked them about the Ford Fusion Hybrid. I told Susan of the Internet Dept that I need to drive an hour to reach their dealership, and they should be honest about assessing trade-in value on my current vehicle.  Strangely when I got there, Susan never came out to greet me - I guessed too lazy to get off her chair to greet a customer who drove the distance to reach the dealership. As a contrast, at other Ford and Chevrolet dealerships, their internet manager/directors would personally come out to greet a customer just arriving -- I've been personally greeted by all the internet managers/directors at all the other Ford and Chevrolet dealerships.  I guessed customer satisfaction is not a motto at Santa Margarita Ford.   Instead, I was paired up with an older gentleman as my salesperson.  He was low-keyed and pretty easy to strike up a conversation.  This was a good salesperson.  We test drove a Fusion Hybrid that I picked out and everything went fine.  What went downhill is when they took my vehicle to their used car department for appraisal.  Since most customers carefully input the accessories and other stuff into the online Kelly Blue Book calculator and it would give you a printout of your trade-in value (within a tight range).  Armed with this Kelly Blue Book trade-in printout, I sat patiently for the trade-in assessment.  I was handed over to the sales manager for the trade-in negotiation and I knew this was going downhill fast.  The sales manager appraised my trade-in at almost over $4000 below the Kelly Blue Book trade-in value printout.  This is a total rip-off! And, the sales manager said that I would get similar low ball trade-in offer from other dealerships.  He said that I shouldn't trust the Kelly Blue Book trade-in value, and trust their used car department - Wow, I'm a professional and I don't need them to tell me this lie.  I WILL trust Kelly Blue Book and not trust their used car department.  With that, I left the dealership for a long drive home - wasted my time and fed a bunch of lies by the sales manager.  To prove Santa Margarita Ford wrong, I went to SouthBay Ford dealership (near LAX) and went through the selection of a new Ford Fusion Energi Plug-In and patiently waited for SouthBay Ford to assess the trade-in value of my vehicle.  Surprisingly, SouthBay Ford's assessment of my trade-in value matched the Kelly Blue Book trade-in printout that I was holding in my hand. This tells me that SouthBay Ford is truthful and transparent in its dealing with customers.  On the other hand, Santa Margarita Ford shouldn't be trusted by their customers.  Beware - you could lose thousands of dollars on your trade-in if you intend to purchase your next vehicle at Santa Margarita Ford.  If you don't believe, print out the Kelly Blue Book trade-in value from your home computer.  Take your trade-in vehicle to Santa Margarita Ford, and watch Santa Margarita miss your Kelly Blue Book trade-value by thousands of dollars.  If you still decide to go through with it, you just financed the ultimate Hawaii vacation for the Santa Margarita's sales manager, salesperson, and finance manager.  If it were me, I would rather take that Hawaii vacation myself instead of financing Hawaii vacations for others.< /review>< userid>

< review>
After visiting two other Ford dealerships to purchase an F-150 Platinum and not receiving anything that resembled an honest deal, I contacted SM Ford online. I was pleasantly surprised at the straightforward communication and offer they presented.

I came down to the dealership and was introduced to my salesman, Peter. No hidden tactics or trying to switch the deal. Very knowledgeable about the product.

The only negative experience I had was with the finance guy. Tried to sell me all the add-ons would push more than he should have.

Overall, I would go back and buy another car from here and specifically Peter.<//review>

<Review>My husband and I had been to many dealerships looking for a car for me.  My son brought me to Ford and we test drove a Fusion with Charlie, he was great but the car was a little too much for me.  My husband brought me back to Ford a week or so later to take a look at the Focus and Blake Ruggles helped us out.  Blake was amazing as he put up with a million questions, lots of initial indecision on my part and a few visits to the dealership. He never made me feel pressured or rushed. After we decided the Focus was what we wanted, Blake was able to get the exact car I wanted.  Then of course came the dreaded Finance Dept., but I will say that John Hadden made the experience very easy and smooth.  John was very patient as he answered all my questions and we felt very satisfied with all of the financing details.  After the purchase of the Ford Focus Titanium, there were a few glitches that were unforeseeable, but Blake and John handled them and I felt they always had my best interest at heart.  We hadn't bought a new car in many years and this was truly a great experience!  I am a Rancho Santa Margarita resident and will definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and co-workers.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80dcebae88c29fd3:0x94c20ab75bfc6b9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is my 2nd time buying a vehicle from RSM Ford! You can always expect excellent service from the staff. Scott,  our original sales rep referred us to Mr. Roby Moore. Scott was very kind and reached out to me and my husband while we were walking around the lot. Unfortunately he could not attend to us tonight because he was off. We were not disappointed by Roby's service though. As picky as my husband and I are... lol... he still kept a professional and kind attitude. Turns out we had a lot in common! You will not disappointed by Robys service. Go to RSM Ford!< /review>

At 8 when I got there they realized the car rental place does not open until 9 so I had to sit at the dealership for an hour until the rental company opened. Then once I got to the rental place they told me that the car company did not make a reservation so I had to wait until a ford came in. I waited another hour and finally just called a friend to pick me up. This is the most disorganized place I have ever dealt with in my life!!  Horrible!!!!!!!!!<//text>< Pictures>

Drazen Canjuga was the sales person.
John Hadden handled my finance.
From the start to the end it was a great experience.  My wife and I walked onto the dealership thinking we would just be looking around to see what's new. Since my wife was 8 months pregnant we were thinking to upgrade my truck for safety reasons. We ended up trading in my truck and buying an F150. They gave us what we wanted for my old truck and gave us a great deal for the new truck. We were happy how we were treated from the sales to the finance. Definitely was the best experience with buying a new truck.< /review>< Pictures>

Jason Saling and Kevin Galaviz were awesome. I received wonderful customer service and Kevin was really patient with me while I test drove each car I was interested in. I went with the practical choice of the Ford Fiesta which to my surprise had a sporty feel and smooth ride. I am loving my new car and the fantastic gas millage I am getting in my new Ford Fiesta!<//Review>

Update 8-31-17
I've had several services since my purchase and I have been very impressed with the service department. I've brought up a few things that concerned me and they have addressed and solved the issues to my satisfaction. What's more important is the small town feel you get when you bring your car in. They truly took care of me and my car. Thank you Miguel and Stephanie for your great customer service!

Great experience! And this is the first independent review after a history of buying three mercedes and a mini cooper. Drazen was our sales rep and he gets five stars all the way for knowledge of Ford products. I had so many changes and request but he was very patient. SM Ford has a lot of pride in their dealership and it showed during my car buying experience. John our finance manager was awesome and he wasn't some stiff pencil pusher in a cheap suit. He was upfront and honest. I got a great deal on my new Ford Mustang and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Now I have to deal with my lease end return of my Mercedes which won't be pleasant because I know they are going to beat me up on charges, however, I am glad not to give my business to Mercedes this time around. SM Ford totally earned my business. They do a stellar job representing RSM.</text>

<review>Nothing stellar. Just a routine oil change and recall repair. The only complaint is that EVERY time I take my car in for service, at least one of the valve caps on the tires is missing or lost. I noticed it today (Monday - service was last Thursday). What made it bad was that I had just replaced the missing caps a day before. Attention to little things makes a huge difference.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>We leased our new Ford Edge just a couple of weeks ago, and what a great experience!  Scott Delabar was such a pleasure to work with, we could not be happier!  John Hadden in financing also was terrific to work with, and we were through our process in a flash and we picked up our new car the next day after the perfect car with the options we wanted was sent to RSM from Ontario.

I brought in my car for a standard oil change and a recall issue.  I called ahead only an hour or so before going in.  It took a little bit to get someone's attention at first (though my car was only one of two cars in line to be serviced) to get help, but once I found someone it was very easy and pleasant.

I also mentioned about my Sync not functioning correctly and the alarm going off for no reason while driving and they said they would check it out.  They shuttled me to my house and later they also picked me up.  All the work was finished in one day.  They Re-programmed the navigation which turned out to be the problem for alarm system and everything else was good.  Only thing they forgot to do was the complimentary car wash, but a customer care lady who followed up with me with a phone call a few days later, said just to stop in and they would give me a car wash.  (with my busy schedule I probably won't have time to but it was kind of her to offer)  She was very kind on the phone and I appreciated the call.

Very good service and I would recommend this dealership to anyone. ;D<//review>

Took car in for 70M service.  Service was quick since I made an appt.  What I disliked was the recommended service to change the cabin air filter.  For an item that costs $25 in the parts department, I was quoted a price of $99.  That would mean for a 1/2 hour service it would cost $74 in labor charge.  I really don't appreciate being over charged.  Think I will look elsewhere for this service.</Text>

<time>1427142085607< /time><rating>1</rating><text>Used Car Sales customer service? I don't think I never received such ill treatment as I did by Santa Margarita Ford. Behind this was the Sales Manager. They would not listen to their non competitive pricing for a Silver 2011 Chevy Suburban LTZ with 47k miles (stock no 43410) priced at $39,950! I made reasonable offer and counter offer and they would not budge more than 500 dollars.

I was quite upset with the way I was handled by the Sales Manager. I felt insulted by his attitude. Not impressed at all by this individual and he should not deal with the public.

I purchased a newer exact vehicle 2013 Suburban LTZ (silver) for 33k. The car is 2 years newer 6 k cheaper and similar mileage and exact same options.

I dont recommend you buy a used car at this dealership. Shop around. In 18 hours, I saved $6,000 and got a 2 year newer vehicle.<//text>< pictures>

<text>I just moved to the area so it was my first time visiting RSM Ford.  I came in for a routine oil change on my Edge.  I parked and walked into the service area where there were several men behind the desks.  I waited for a few minutes before someone said "we will be right with you".  I waited a few more minutes and another gentleman asked me if I was waiting for someone in particular.  I let him know that I was not waiting for anyone in particular but was there for a routine oil change and he told me that they would be right with me.  I was a littled bothered when a girl walked in at this point and was helped right away. I waited a few more minutes before being helped.  The gentleman who helped me was very friendly and helpful.  I would have rated my experience 5 stars if I did not have to wait so long to be helped.< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Customer service is always great and is somewhere between 4-5 stars.  The 3 star review is a result of an issue with my car not being fixed.  Despite my car lunging, surging and having a loss of power, I was told that it operated within Ford's specs.  This is the same issue I've had twice before and had the TCM replaced once.  I feel I'm going down the same road and am frustrated this transmission issue does not have a permanent fix.  The loss of power upon accelerating from a complete stop, especially when on an incline feels dangerous.  Ford extended the warranty, but I still have to deal with this issue again until this part fails again.  This is more of an issue with Ford, rather than the dealer.</text>

< Review>
This is like our 4th car that we bought from Santa Margarita Ford.  We pass other ford dealerships to come to this one. On Friday night we purchased my leased ford and also bought my husband a car. Our salesman was amazing he worked with us and was so friendly,  thanks David Olender.
Also the finance manager John Hadden was terrific,  he worked with us twice that night and explained everything clearly.
I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a wonderful deal on a ford.
We will be back in 3 years when it's time for my daughter to drive.
Thanks again Santa  Margarita Ford.</Review>

I went to RSM Ford to have a battery replaced. My only gripe is, they told me it would take 90 minutes to do the job. Strange it would take that long to remove and install a battery, a job that would take me 15 minutes. It was even more strange since I made an appointment for them to do it first thing in the morning, but I thought 90 minutes isn’t too long, so I decided to stay and wait. Unfortunately instead of 90 minutes it took over three hours.
Kind of screwed up my only day off to run errands.</Text>

SMFord is by far 5☆
Well....purchased 2007 Expedition, 2012 Edge, a 2007 Edge for my daughter and my most recent, the 2016 Edge Titanium Sunday. BIG "Thank You" to Jim Wheeler for making our purchases a treat. I let him know in detail on Saturday what I was looking for beforehand, receiving prompt responses along with what's available. I arrive Sunday, the Edge is awaiting in front. After test drive, I was in and out in apprx. 1hr. *DONE DEAL* ;-) The Service Dept is great also. To walk in and be greeted by first name... a welcoming feeling here. Thank you SMFord!!!</Review>

<Text>I've been a customer of this dealership for 6 years now and have purchased 2 vehicles. My dad, grandfather, and uncle all currently work or retired from Ford. Loved them until the most recent interaction. Came in to get my oil changed and to get my rear camera looked at because it was only working 50% of the time. We're going on a road trip for a week and I wanted to make sure the car was in good shape. Walked away paying almost $200 just for them to tell me that my camera needs to be replaced ($900) and the oil change. Two days later, I get a notification from my car that I have low oil pressure. I just got the oil changed so this shouldn't be happening. Spoke to a rep on the phone and he said it's a 5 minute fix. Came early in the morning to get the 5 minute fix done and sure enough they wanted to check it out to see what's going on. They had it for over 9 hours just to tell me that the oil pressure sensor needs to be changed and is going to cost me another $300. I called another mechanic that I've been to previously and without telling them how much I would get charged at the dealership, they were going to charge me $187. I called Ford and was thankful that they negotiated with me to match the quote. However, I can't help but believe that the previous service caused the reported damage the second go around. I didn't have time to argue about it and needed to just get it done to make sure my family is safe during our road trip. We left 2 days later and as I'm driving through Arizona I get an "Oil Change Required" light. I've had it. After several conversations and multiple trips to the dealership, this happens while I'm on the road. Granted the rep said that they did change my oil but forgot to reset the oil change meter. When I'm trusting you with my car and paying for peace of mind that the job got done correctly, it needs to be double checked especially if I've been to your business multiple times in one week. Sorry to say that I won't be getting my car service there any longer and will be purchasing my next car from a different dealership.</Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

I was happy about my experience purchasing a new car at Ford RSM and I'm very happy with the car I chose. I was looking for a specific model, the Ford Fusion, but I wasn't sure about engine size etc. I didn't want the hybrid so I test drove two cars and realized the 2.0L was what I needed. My experience with Ford RSM was solid. No big attempts to up sell me. They priced it well on the 1st pass and the finance guy offered his usual upgrades but not in a pushy way. I usually like getting an extended warranty anyway and I got a good price on that. My sales rep, Dakotah, was knowledgable and kept the process moving along at a reasonable pace.< /Text>

<Review>If I could give them six stars, I would. We have purchased two cars from them in less than three months! Ryan and Scott are the best, and have gone out of their way to make these the best car buying experiences ever. We purchased a certified pre-owned Ford Focus and a certified pre-owned Ford Fiesta and they are like brand new! Plus, they went above and beyond at delivery to make it a very special day for my son. Shopping for and buying a new car can be a stressful experience, but everyone at Santa Margarita Ford instantly removed the stress. Plus, the prices are extremely competitive--we had done a lot of research and we could not have done better. If you're looking for a car, this is the place to go!< /Review>< response>

Accompanied by my fiancé and his parents, I made my very first solo car purchase a few days ago and am so glad it happened at Santa Margarita Ford, and more specifically with David O. and John H., who made the whole experience so easy! I really never anticipated being so comfortable during a car buying process.

David was straight forward and matter of fact, but not aggressively so.   What's more is that he took the time to speak with me today when I called with some "ahhh this is my first huge purchase and I'm annoying!" questions.  He was very patient which I truly appreciated and this is just one reason of many why I feel confident with my purchase.

John in finance was also patient, and extremely helpful in breaking the numbers down for me and making everything crystal clear.

I know quite a few people looking to buy new cars, and I'm glad I can recommend this dealership based on such a great experience.< /Review>

<Text>My salespersonTom Glockner was awesome! Started with a phone call, told him what I was looking for, within 24 hours He called me back and said that he found the truck that I was looking for. He sent me pictures, we talked about everything over the phone. Once the paperwork was drawn up and ready to sign he called me and said come pick up truck. I pulled in the parking lot Rancho Santa Margarita Ford and couldn't believe it when I saw my truck (F150 301A) It was Beautiful. I spent about 45 minutes they're mostly talking to Tom telling him thank you. I sign the papers and went home. It was the best car buying experience I have ever experienced.
Thank you Tom.

Took video on my cell to document problem, since many times the dealer has trouble with "reproducing the problem" when you take your car in to be fixed.
RSM Ford diagnosed and fixed the problem. So far, so good......
Miguel helped take care of it and found a solution to satisfy my concern.

I had noticed that my brakes were acting a bit strange over the past week and decided to take it in to be looked at. Santa Margarita Ford (SMF) was able to get me in right away on a busy Saturday morning. Upon examing the car, the technician discovered that the brake booster was actually a defective part. He replaced it at no charge and I was able to pick up my car the same day. It was fantastic. All of my interactions with SMF have been pleasant, positive, and stress-free. I think that is quite a feat to achieve for a car dealership. Kudos to the crew at SMF!!< /review>

< review>
I am very concerned about the latest refusal to perform a service that I requested. I bought a Dodge Ram 2010 1500 from Santa Margarita Ford about 8 months ago, and every time I bring it in for service, they refuse to work on anything unique to the Dodge, even though Santa Margarita Ford sold me an extended service warranty. The lastest one was a ticking sound that, upon doing some research, appears to be a known problem with exhaust manifold bolts breaking. SMF service manager gave me some evasive answer to my service request and told me I need to go to a Dodge service place. I found a Chrysler Tech Service Bulletin that sounds like the exact problem. I think SMF is trying to avoid standing behind the warranty they gave me. So I plan to read the fine print and possibly refer the matter to my attorney (my wife).< /review>
<Response>{'time': 1468863647065, 'text': 'Mr. Rubens,\nFirst off, thank you for purchasing a vehicle from our Dealership. I have heard many good things about the Dodge trucks and their reliability. In regards to servicing your vehicle, the warranty you purchased (Portfolio) is a complete warranty. It comes with the coverage you need. Our technicians at Santa Margarita are primarily Ford technicians. They can perform basic repairs on other makes, fluid exchanges, brakes, alignments, etc. When it comes to noise concerns or more advanced diagnosis, we refer guests to a Certified Dealer. A Dodge Dealer will have access to all the latest and greatest information and repair procedures that are proprietary to Dodge. Once you take you vehicle to a Dodge Dealer, they will inspect it, call the Portfolio authorization and claim number, and then the repairs will be approved based on specific component coverage. We do business with the local Dodge Dealership in SJC, Courtesy Chrysler Dodge and Jeep. Bring a copy of your contract and they will make copies. If it is easier for you, drop the car to us and we can deliver it to the Dodge dealer on your behalf with your permission.\nIf you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us.\n\nThank you,\nGina Allen\nDirector of Fixed Operations'}<//Response><userid>102282785460623941070< /userid>< Rating>

<text>RSM Ford is the best dealer experience I have had in recent years. Since I bought my Ranger from them a few years ago, I had to move to Fullerton and Irvine being a bit too far (I thought) to go to RSM for servicing and repairs, so I tried McCoy Mills and Tuttle Click. McCoy Mills was a huge travesty and Tuttle Click proved to be another big mistake. Finally, I knew there was only one Ford dealer for me and that is RSM (despite the long drive). Also, you could not ask for a nicer more helpful and fair professional Service Advisor than Duane nor  a more pleasant closing out than from his beautiful Service Assistant, Bella. I highly recommend that if you have a Ford vehicle of any kind and no matter how far from you they are, that you make the trek to RSM Ford and utilize their services because they truly do understand the term, "Customer Service". Plus, if you are looking for a new car deal, it's their 20th Anniversary so they are really trying to give you a good price and you should take advantage of their celebration.<//text>< Pics>

Today I purchased a used 2014 Kia Optima from Robbie Moore one of their sales people.  Really nice guy, no pressure in anyway and no b.s.  Charlie Pastick who finalized all the closing docs was really great and also a nice guy.  It was a good experience just dealing with what I would call normal people.  No high pressure and run around like some dealers, not to mention any names.

After driving home I noticed the license plate holder with the dealer name on bottom and top of the frame says "We Get It"!  They do.  After many of hours research on the internet looking for a decent used vehicle, I can honestly say Santa Margarita Ford has some of the best used car prices out there.  So bottom-line...I am a happy camper.  I would never hesitate to recommend anyone to this dealership.  Good job guys!</review>

Disappointed with the sales team.  I was more educated on the available features of the Explorer Sport than they were.  Rushed out upon completing the purchase and not shown how to operate any of the functions of the car.  SYNC system is somewhat convoluted and apparently they are supposed to also make a return appointment to go over that feature in detail.  I'm very technical and have figured most of them out myself via the web and relative intuitiveness.  The gentleman in finance was the savior that salvaged the deal, the sales guys can thank him when they get their commission check.  Highly suggest better training and knowledge with the sales team.  When your business is selling a particular product and limited models with similar features, you better know it frontward and backward instead of sitting on the benches in front of the dealership BS'ing and drinking coffee.  I work for a company who's motto is Customer Happiness and I left RSM Ford feeling a bit empty on that front.< /text>

My Wife Donna hates car shopping. I literally have to have the car picked out and the deal done before she'll even set foot in the dealership.  Last week we needed to replace her tired Mazda SUV. The team at Santa Margarita Ford made it easy on me.
Sue Grinnan in internet sales found the right car, Peter Dore showed my wife all the features and advantages to her new (lightly used) Escape.
I brought my own financing so Dave Franco and John Hadden put the package together for me.
Great Team.</text>

Loyal F-150 buyer (3 in the last 12 years, from another dealer) bought my 4th from Santa Margarita Ford.  Almost says it all right there!
BUT, I want to give a shout out to the individuals who made it a GREAT experience:
#1 Sue Grinnan, their internet guru who responded quicker than immediately to a Costco car-finder inquiry.  Helpful, found out my car needs, responded with a few choices, and handed me off to a salesman;
#2 Charlie Pastick, professional, patient, personable.  Low key, clearly explained the options without the expected pressure sales pitch.  Found the right vehicle with the exact options requested.  Even drove out to the dealership that had the right car and brought it back, same day!  Above and beyond...
#3 John Hadden, dreaded "closer"...but not really!  Quick, efficient, giving a few financing options which can only be described as "better" and "best".  Offered a few enhancements to the deal, one of which I chose.  Again, low key, transparent with the numbers; allowed me to make my own choice.
I'll see you in 4 years guys!!< /Review>

Robbie is the MAN!  I have bought many cars over my lifetime and sold cars for a spell.  Robbie and the Sales Managers at RSM Ford are hands down the best!  I called in on a LOOOOONG Shot about an upgrade of my Fusion Energi to a Titanium Energi.  Not only did he put together an awesome deal we were in for the Test Drive, and out driving out new car heading to dinner in under 2 hours...  I am totally not kidding.  Under 2 hours...  I have never before bought a car in under 6 hours if I was lucky.  Look no further.  This is where you want to go to get the BEST DEAL with the BEST PEOPLE...  Tell Robbie I sent you.

<text>My disapointing Oil Change
I had an apointment at 7:15 AM, I came early and expected to get out early
since I had to wait for my car.  90 minutes later I finatly got my car back.
That is way to long for me.  When Peter Kobal was my Service Manager
It took no more than one hour or less and that included a car wash.
I dnot think I will be back to Ford for an Oil change.
There are maney for oil chnge in OC.  Trive Thru Oil Change promis a

Your arrival time with the transit was at 7:07 am and it was completed at 8:17 am for the “Works Package”. After speaking with Roger he did confirm that the vehicle was brought up not washed because you needed to get out fast. After you requested the wash we did go back and wash the exterior. It did take longer than normal due to the confusion. We apologize for this inconvenience and have noted in your file that the next “Work’s Package” is on us.

I'm waiting too! Just because I'm not sitting there doesn't mean I don't need my car back in a timely manner. What's the point of making an appt? Why don't they just say "if you sit here

Miguel didn’t communicate with you about our process on Saturday services and I apologize for that. If a guest chooses to wait in our lounge for the duration of the service those vehicles go in order along with any appointments and walk-in’s. We understand that all guests are “waiting” whether at home, work or in our lobby. We could have done a better job of explaining this at the time of write-up so you would be able to make an more informed decision. I noticed in your review that you stated that you came in for The Works package, and when reviewing your history, I see we did not perform The Works package, we performed an oil and filter change with no tire rotation. Were you also requesting a tire rotation during that visit? Please let us know so we can rectify the situation immediately.

The experience dealing with salesman Mike Blumenthal and Finance manager John  Hadden has been the best and most efficient of any of the vehicles I have ever purchased or leased. The transaction took minutes from start to finish with no haggle . I have dealt with many less scrupulous car sales people recently  and I can certainly vouch for the professionalism, efficiency, honesty  and courtesy extended by Mr. Blumenthal and Mr. Hadden . I had reached out to many  dealerships and only Mike Blumenthal responded and stood by his response throughout the experience. The total time spent  deciding on the vehicle and writing up the lease contract with John was less than 30 minutes which is unheard of but a fact .I have run a successful business for 26 years and highly recommend you call Mike Blumenthal  if you are interested in a Ford product and insist on having John Hadden do the paperwork. I also appreciated receiving a  personalized signed letter of appreciation from Santa Margarita Ford President Jim Graham. By the way the Ford plug-in hybrids are amazing hi-tech  vehicles and the fed and state rebates are excellent not to mention access to car pool lane as a single driver.< /text>

After having my tires consistently filled to the wrong pressure and my oil life never reset (little annoyances), I'd finally had it when I made an appointment to have my alignment done and a power steering line replaced and they didn't tell me until I came to pick it up that they couldn't align my vehicle and didn't have the line and couldn't get it.  I also gave the service rep a long explanation of a steering issue I've had where the vehicle will apply one of the brakes arbitrarily in a turn.  It's not my imagination as passengers feel it and ask what happened and the brake pedal depresses noticably when it happens.  It's a very dangerous condition that I assume has to do with a faulty traction control system.  They said they couldn't duplicate the problem.  Note to service tech from the rep was "check for dragging brake".  Sent me on my way with the dangerous condtion still in full effect.  Going elsewhere for repairs from now on.  I've never had an experience where they didn't do something wrong.< /Review>

<review>when i drop off my explorer yesterday i told one of the guy from service regarding the noise i herard form the A/C and he told me that i will make sure that he check it out.I went back there to pick it up and i believe it wasn't
check because it wasn't  documented.he should put an extra note so the technician will know what to else he need to do beside the regular service.I do believe that if it's documented it means it was not done.period...<//review>< Pictures>

This place socks bough my truck there and they sold me extended warranty that only let's me go back to their crudy stealer ship for warranty repairs.  Their techs could not fix the issue so what can you do.  Drive to a dealership 50 miles away and get the truck repaired.

The worst part of a all this is that the extended warranty through ford cost the same.<//text>
