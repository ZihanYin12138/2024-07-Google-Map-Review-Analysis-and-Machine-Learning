<Review>Beautiful church. Wondeful and welcoming congregation and staff. I really enjoy Sunday service and just the peaceful environment to worship each week.

Plenty of parking as well. Very organized during Covid.</Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNcee_bacXfcGGq8hcJue_9fwz3dK1guB45vn-K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2bc0852b97ce5:0x6d04833177281620< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This place is awful! Tried to call the place to get baptismal rights. Worst service ever! I would have gotten a better response from a satanic cult than from this place. They called me names and mocked my race. I wouldn't call them a catholic church, a true catholic wouldn't have that kind of tongue. Stay away from this place if I were you.</Review>

<review>I take offense to the previous  e-mail stating that positive reviews of this house of worship are less than factual.  Everyone is welcomed  who has God in their hearts.  If you have feelings of ill will; those are of your own belief and accord.  I enjoy coming here and appreciate the atmosphere of cordiality and christian worship.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

GOD BLESS!! ✝️✝️✝️✝️MUST MENTION THAT THIS ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH EXEMPLIFIES GOD’S WILL. EVERYONE INCLUDING FATHER O’RYAN, FATHER BENIOFF, AND MICHELLE FROM THE RECTORY/OFFICE HAVE BEEN THE MOST HELPFUL IN ORDERING MASSES FOR MY DECEASED FATHER. I CANNOT WANT TO GO BACK TO MASS THERE!!

I have been a parishioner of Good Shepherd for over 15 years. Both Fr. O'Ryan and Fr. Benioff are fantastic. The parish in general is very friendly and active in many ministries. Our music ministry is 2nd to none with beautiful organ music and amazing singers. Please come and join us, all are welcome. Deo Gratias<//Review>

There is a lot of history here in terms of fame, but there is a LOT more history here when it comes to family and friends.
What a wonderful church.

<Review>THE best choir and cantor we’ve ever heard, BUT also the yappiest Mass we’d ever been to!  Visiting CA from out of state, we’d selected Good Shepherd for our Sunday worship. We arrived early and there was a buzz in the church as many of the parishioners were visiting with each other. That’s fine and all as it builds community, but they didn’t even try to keep it somewhat quiet for those coming early and wanting some quiet to prepare their hearts for the Word and Communion. The buzz increased as more people arrived, and it was more like we were at the theatre than in a worship space. It finally quieted down, but the congregation never seemed to settle into Mass. There was lots going on between pews, and I don’t mean just the understandable fussy children, but likewise inattentive adults. There was even a gentleman that was visiting, loudly, with someone in the pew behind him...post Communion! Couldn’t believe it!  Someone WAS trying to shush the congregation from the back during Mass, but to no avail. I pray this community continues to get 5 star reviews, but for this more traditional family, we’ll seek quieter Masses when back in town. I humbly submit this critical review in a constructive manner.</Review><user_name>Doc B<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

<review>Asked for help... emergency ....and they argued with me that I would not answer my phone on the middle...of it..this went on for days snd weeks..even now I called asking why they have not called me and they gave the excuse that I do not answer my phone again even though I am waiting all day .I would like to discuss this with a humanitarian person witin the church if their is any. I am upset and in shock and will not support any organization who is this abusive in the future when I get help to do my humanitarian work the way God gives me the wisdom to do in a loving way and not hateful as the energy this church is putting out. .</review>< user>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>I had my doubts about attending mass in Beverly Hills, I didn't want to deal with stuck up people and all the stereotypes the rich have, but I gave it a chance. From the moment I first set foot in the church I truely felt like I was coming home. We have no other family in the area and The Church of the Good Shepherd is where I feel like I am welcome, accepted and wanted. My family has nothing in common with other people in the parish, other than being Catholic, but I don't feel any of that at the church or the socials we have attended. We have tried many, many other Catholic perishes in the area, and across the country, and this is the best (other than the Church I grew up in). Father Ed's homilies are always relevant and on point. Other Priests who hold mass from time to time are also relevant and bring the readings to today and relating to everyday life. Unfortunately Father Ed and Michelle are not able to stay on top of everything at every moment right now due to a very small staff and other responsibilities in the diocese. If you attend Mass you can be sure to feel the presence of Christ and come away with some ideas and understanding of how Christ is present and working and how you can make your life more relevant to following Christ. Any negative reviews can be reconsidered by trying to be more Christ like and filling in where the church is lacking to make the community more whole. You will not be disappointed in mass or the presence of Christ at the church. Everything outside of mass at a Catholic Church is a group project and takes participation from the community, if you see a need than fill it to make it better rather than criticizing and trying to turn others away.

From what ive seen....the church attendees are very nice & the church staff includirng the priest really are lax.  It seems like they understand that they are the last line of defense when it comes to human decency.

When all else fails, the Catholic Church should be always known & understood as a place where no matter who you are l or 2hat your going through, love will be the only thing you feel when walking through those church doors.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>A beautiful place of worship. Both the parish council and congregation are very friendly.  Also a church steeped in Hollywood lore and history.

This is an update. Please don't mind any criticism. This church has meant the world to me since I first attended services in 1973. I plan on returning to the city when I retire and hope to become a member of the congregation.

All my love to God, this church and this city.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc0852b97ce5:0x6d04833177281620</Gmap_id></record>

I had the pleasure of conducting the baptism of my newborn at the Good Shepherd Church and found the experience intimate, meaningful and very professional. The administrative staff did a wonderful job handling protocols & logistics. Father Ed Benioff if a wonderful leader, with deep appreciation of his congregation and of the service his profession entails. I would highly recommend the Church of Good Shepherd for members of the Catholic faith and newcomers.</review>

< Review>
I called in during the week to set up a wedding date. A woman named Michelle had answered the phone and set up an appointment to meet with A Father Ed. We went in on a Saturday, my fiancee and I to meet Father Ed to set up our wedding and date and to learn more about the church experience. Needless to say 2 weeks went by and we were waiting for Father Ed to get back to us on a few SIMPLE questions. I had called in because no one was responding to us. I had gotten Michelle back on the phone inquiring about the date we set with Father Ed as well as the unanswered questions from our first meeting. Michelle took my information and instructed me that she would be speaking with Father Ed after he got in AFTER 12 and she would then circle back with me on feedback. So, TWO days later I called back again for a 3rd time, still unaware of where my fiance and I stood with our Wedding date  and our meeting with Father Ed.  Michelle now picked up the phone and said " Why are you calling!, I told you I would get back with you when I hear something.." Now 4 weeks have transpired and still no response from anyone at this point. My poor sweet fiance called in and asked if she could speak Michelle. Michelle now at this screened her call and told the gentleman through the phone she has not heard anything and why are we calling back?
I urge anyone who is looking to find a church to call home, this is not the place. If you are looking for a Priest or front parish with INTEGRITY. This is not the place to call home. STAY AWAY FROM THIS CHURCH. They are the reason our Catholic church has a bad name, people like this who are careless. I am disappointed in this place Father Ed, Michelle and those in that parish that they do not take their roles more serious. I want people everywhere to know what the experience is like in this place, a Catholic born and raised that people. This is a careless Lot. You should be ashamed to call yourself a CHRISTIAN. By the way look at the other manufactured reviews included here they have no substance. Is this church employing people to post a review in their behalf??? WOW!!
from a concerned Born and raised Catholic who has spent his entire life apart of the St. Cyrils parish</Review>

<review>This place is awful! Tried to call the place to inquire about getting a schedule for my baby's baptismal rights. Worst service ever! I would have gotten a better response from a satanic cult than from this place. They called me names and mocked my race. I wouldn't call them a catholic church, a true catholic wouldn't have that kind of tongue. Stay away from this place if I were you.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc0852b97ce5:0x6d04833177281620</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5< /Rating><name>Evan Green< /name><Review>The portions are utterly massive here, very very good value. I try something new almost every time I go and am not disappointed. Their fried rice is so damn delicious that you're missing out by not paying the extra price for it when ordering an entree. Some of my favorites have been the chicken curry, the sesame beef, and the chicken lo mein. The pork dishes are also very good. I never leave unsatisfied. If you can visit during the lunch time, the lunch specials are an absurdly good value.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Gmap_id>0x80db7e7777c08655:0xca82476cbb4d38fb< /Gmap_id><userid>112409613683164863641< /userid></record>

Not sure why all the bad reviews.  This place is really quite good. Food is always fresh and hot. Tried 3 different things 3 different times and all have been great. I would recommend giving it a shot<//Review>

Great food and great service.  I order online and they have it ready for me with a smile.  We have stopped going anywhere else for our chinese takeout.

We always have an abundance of leftovers.  The portions look small but then you realize on the first bite how big it really is.</review>

<Text>Alright, we are all in Quarantine right now, but if you really want quality food and service, take a look at this small place. I have eaten in house twice and they have been wonderful!

So, on to delivery. Contactless, but I chased him down to make sure he got his tip. Anyhow, I laid it out on a plate as it was a lot, but, here are the Pot Stickers and Beef and Broccoli. As I requested, as not a menu option, they added heat to my dish. I said "Chef's Choice" and it was PERFECT!  The meal comes with steamed rice, but we all know what rice looks like. Fried rice is an option. Support these guys folks! Go local! They put out some great food and it is quality food and great portions. I give them five as they rock!< /Text>< user_name>

Terrible and rude customer service. They gave me the wrong order and when I called about it they said they would deliver me another one with the correct order. I waited over two hours for them to deliver me the correct order and they never showed up. When I called again about the order they told me that they never said they would bring another one and that they gave me the correct order. I ordered chicken and I got shrimp. After waiting for the two hours I simply asked for a refund and they refused to. Do not order from them they are absolutely ungrateful and do not care about their costumers and will just take your money.< /review>

<Review>I have ordered the same items a few times every month and I noticed smaller portions . They only gave me a small container of rice with 4 entrees ordered. Shrimp with lobster sauce only now has enough shrimp for one. The value is not as good as it used to be.< /Review>< rating>

On God the worst Milk Tea Boba IN MY LIFE. The Thai Boba was completely terrible. Please make yall Thai Boba sweet and learn a thing or 2 from Mr.Chi or Blue Elephant. Red flags when i saw the Boba just sitting there next to the soda machine out in the open. Haven't tried the Chinese food which looks good but it's a complete No on the boba. Thanks anyways.<//Text>

I ordered the salt & peppered wings. It had great flavor & was crispy. I also ordered The Mongolian beef lunch special for $7. It came with an egg drop soup, noodles, fried rice & an egg roll. The Mongolian sauce on the beef was very tasty, a little sweet like how I like it. The beef was sliced thin & so tender. My daughter ordered the teriyaki chicken bowl. Which was ok. But she loved it.<//text>

<Review>Just ordered on line and it was delivered to my home. The food is the BEST I have had since I was a kid growing up in Chicago. I have not had fresh pan fried Egg Foo Young since living there until today. Portions are generous and prices are good. This food is even better than Peonies and Panda Express!

I had high hopes for this place because of the high reviews but my experience was just average. The flavors of the food were good but the dishes were lacking. The lemon chicken was very thin sliced. So thin it was like a chicken chip with lemon dipping sauce. The Mongolian beef had very little beef and a thousand veggies. The soups were the best part of the meal. Skip the fortune cookies they tasted like cheap imitation versions. Overall it felt like they were cutting corners on the meal trying to save money. I'm not ready to give up on the restaurant just yet but I will look at others before I give them another shot . hopefully there other dishes are more impressive<//Text>

I tried SoChina for the very first time tonight and sadly I was very unhappy. The price was good but, the food was bad. The order of Crab Rangoon was small but, my husband said it was alright. The white rice container I ordered with my General Tso was not filled all the way. The General Tso had pineapple in it? I’ve never seen this before. I have typically been it with broccoli. The Lo mein and fried I ordered tasted off. I can’t place it and I did not like the smell. Unfortunately, I will not order from here again. I wish I could get a refund.< /Review>

Not returning. I do not think the chicken is 100% and it taste like my food was cooked with recycled oil. Did not meet my standard of “good Chinese food” I’ll have to try a different restaurant next time. Thumbs down!</Review>

Place is clean and the staff is friendly, eager to please. We ordered the house chow fun and orange chicken. The noodles were cooked perfectly and the orange chicken sauce isn’t too sweet. Under $20. Waaaay better than Panda Express. We’ll be back</Review>

I order out from here quite frequently, and it is some of the best comfort food around my area. If you are looking for authentic Chinese food, this is not for you. Although most of the dishes sound of traditional Chinese foods, don’t let that fool you, this is amazing comfort food.</Review>

Ordered food for take out when this place first opened. Food was delicious and portions were very generous. Employees were a bit frazzled when I came in, but I believe that is because they just opened and it was super busy. Would definitely give this place another shot.</review>

You get decent amount food for your money and the prices are reasonable. I had the teriyaki chicken lunch special. The rice and chow mein were good but the teriyaki chicken was lackluster.< /review>

We felt like having Chinese food so I did a search what was nearby. We chose So China because of the Yelp reviews. Soooooo glad we did. Although the egg drop soup was very bland the orange chicken was amazing! Crispy just how I like it. The hubs got kung pao chicken and he said it was fantastic. He specifically said the veggies were done and had a crisp to them but they were not raw. We will definately go back. Large portions and daily lunch specials, and very reasonable.</review>

<Rating>4</Rating><Text>The appetizers served before the main course is quite bland by itself, however the sweet and sour sauce is tasty and unique. My entire meal was served to me directly and the drink I ordered, (coke), is well mixed and their smoothies, e.G. mango, strawberry, and taro, look delicious as well. The atmosphere is simple, relaxing and I have a strong feeling that when this place gets crowded, it will get hectic. I ordered the Orange chicken with the upgraded side of Chow Mein. The Chow Mein was well prepared and to go along with that the Orange Chicken was outstanding. The perfect amount of crisp tag-teaming with the perfect amount of sauce made it and outstanding dinner. The servings are larger than expected and would feed a happy couple easily. Everything is fresh made so it is hot when served and stays hot throughout the meal. I am not a fan of the plastic forks and paper cups but, I do agree with their idea on the no lid policy. The restaurant is absolutely Family Friendly. The staff is kind and serves your food to you with speed and efficiency. (Although it could change based on popularity). All in all it's cheaper than Panda Express, it tastes better than Panda Express. It has the variety of P.F. Chang's. It is an all around great place to eat. (Total was $13.10). I highly recommend to anyone who wants an upgrade to Panda Express at a cheaper price. This place is fantastic and I hope this review was resourceful.</Text>< Pics>

Best Chinese around! Lunch portions are a great deal and dinner portions are huge! We have tried orange chicken, general chicken, beef and broccoli, kung pao chicken and shrimp, chow mein and all have been amazing! The egg rolls are also delicious. And you really can't beat their prices!<//text>

How can I make this more obvious:  AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!  I needed gas and am unfamiliar with this area of LA.  I wanted to use my Ralph's Rewards tie in discount and their pump wouldn't take my log in, so I went to the cashier who spoke about 10 words of English (maybe).  He processed my credit card and I went back to the pump.  It didn't take my $.20 discount per gallon, so I went back to the cashier.  Since his command of English was non existent, he called in a guy who was painting curbs outside.  The guy outside proceeded to insult me by saying I was at fault for my Ralph's discount not working.  I asked for a refund on my AMEX and he wouldn't give it to me and proceeded back to his paint and brush.  I never pumped any gas and I even called the owner of the franchise and left a message requesting a call back (I never received one, 10 days later and counting).  Luckily I used AMEX and they never allowed these crooks to charge me for gas.<//text>

< Review>
Absolutely, one of the most economical, reasonable portions, and extremely down to Earth servers over the counter. It's arguably one of the few places where I find great customer service, great food, and an affordable price. Whenever, I dine in to eat, I regularly order a veggie sandwich, one cookie, and iced unsweented black tea for an afforable price. Subway has a collective control over the sandwich market within the fast food industry. However, it's crucial to support smaller family owned businesses and not to be dissmisve among appearances. Nonetheless, the only con of this site is they only accept cash, but there's an ATM machine inside. Final note, the owners are humble, unpretentious, and kind people. I love it!</Review>

Johnathon Y. helped me out on two cases, helped three of my friends and three of my family members all were settled with a win. Don't let the short guy in a suit fool you he knows what he is doing. It's been years but he helped me get through a rough period of my life and it's never to late to show your gratitude. My advice to anyone, just make sure to make all your appointment's for your treatment. Thanks old friend. Sincerely, Mr. Miranda<//Text>

<rating>1<//rating><Review>Beware of using this law firm. I was involved in an accident 1 year ago they immediately sent me to therapy and to get X-rays. Everything seemed amazing at first good communication and they were tentative. After about 8 months I told the chiropractor that I was no longer feeling pain and was good to go. When I tried contacting my attorney from that point on I could never get ahold of anyone. I would call and each time I would be told that the attorney that was handling my case was no longer working at that law firm; they would tell me the name of the new attorney and then ask if I would like to leave a voicemail, I would leave a voicemail asking them to contact me back and they never would. I called 6 weeks back to back never had anyone reach out to me. Now today exactly one year after my accident they sent me a letter telling me they are dropping me from representation with no rhyme or reason as to why; tried calling they passed me to the attorneys name who was on the letter, funny thing is that when I connected you could tell it connected to her Bluetooth over the car and I could hear my own voice but she acted as if she could not hear me. The letter stated I have 2 years from the time of the accident to submit a lawsuit, they took one year and dropped me with no explanation. They state that they treat their clients like family but I found that not to be true if you are looking for an attorney I would advise to go elsewhere.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

This is an excellent law firm. I got into a really bad car accident a few months ago and I had no idea what to do. As soon as I called Yagoubzadeh Law Firm, everything changed. They explained my rights and the overall process. That put me at ease. From there, I got the medical attention I needed, I got my car fixed, and to top it off I got a big settlement when all was said and done. Best part about it was that my attorney Daniel was super nice and pleasant to work with. Will definitely be referring this place to friends and family!< /Review>

They were professional and efficient in settling my bodily injury claim and better yet helped me get appropriate medical care to get better after my accident. I think most surprising of all was how often they contacted me, including after the case settlement to check in on me. That compassionate touch really stayed with me.

Worst lawyer ever, took my case just because he heard a big company Name. Never once gave me a call to keep me updated on my case that shows how much he cares about his clients, on top of that receptionist in the front were very rude and would keep lying one would say he left for the day and the other would say that Johnathan was on a conference call. Now I am left hanging dry to pay all the medical bill expenses, I also read that all his reviews on google and yelp are either fake profiles or people were paid to write the reviews. Sad to say there are lawyers like this in the law business, I will definitely be contacting the board to put out a concern about their law practices. In other words go find yourself an actual lawyer who gives 1 care about the client. But when it was time for me to sign the legal documents he was calling and texting me every minute, and be aware they use fake google numbers to contact you so once they dont wanna handle your case they just get a new number. Sonia Robles the case manager also did a poor job with keeping in contact with me, over all this law firm is one of the worst in California...<//Review>

<Text>The lawyers and staff here really care about their clients. They’ve always gone the extra mile when I’ve dealt with them and I like the fact it’s run by 3 brothers who are all lawyers, makes it more personal and less corporate which is hard to come by these days.< /Text>< UserId.>

I have never been in a major accident so with the help of having an attorney to help guide and have me in their best interest is such a relief. The other party insurance has taken fault of my back, neck, and shoulder pain that is being treated through law firm’s contacts. I’ve tried going through my own insurance but having an attorney helps put the urgency and appropriate care in order. If any other parties try talking to you, don’t answer any questions, just give them Yaglaw’s contact info, Yaglaw will put them in check. Thanks to the Yaglaw team: Jonathan, Melissa and especially Isabella.</Text>< Resp>

< Review>
I was rear ended in early August of 2012 by a drunk driver. It was multiple car accident and the drunk driver hit two vehicles, including mine, in plain daylight and then tried to drive his car onto the sidewalk and when the car didn't move, he tried to run on foot before finally being caught by the police.

I contacted another law firm first thing on Monday morning since the accident took place over the weekend. When I reported the accident to my insurance I asked them about seeing a doctor, they simply told me to pay out of pocket and then I would be reimbursed. That to me didn't sound right since both me and my son were injured in the accident.

When I called the other law firm, based on the Yelp reviews, I was greeted by a female employee who asked me to email her the pictures from the accident and someone would contact me shortly. I emailed her the pictures on Monday around 9am. I didn't hear back from anyone that day. After work, I ended up going to Urgent Care because my back and my shoulder were killing me. I was in pain. I also took my son to get a quick check up just to make sure. Since I have a PPO, I ended up paying $40 off the back for the visits and an additional $39 in medication. $79.00 just in one visit!!!!

On Tuesday morning my shoulder, back and neck were killing me again. So, I sent a follow up email to the same staff at the other law firm with an additional video from the accident that my son had taken with his phone. I didn't get a response to either one of the emails. I went ahead and called the office in the afternoon to see if they had received any of my emails. The same staff answered the phone and advised me she had forward that information to a case manager.

At that point, I wasn't sure what to make out of it. So, I contacted Jonathan Yagoubzadeh and emailed his office the same pictures and video I had sent to other law office. Jonathan called me within 30 minutes and took the time to talk to me directly, asked the necessary questions, explained the process, and was kind enough to find a medical provider close to my office. He even offered to meet me at a convenient time and place so I wouldn't have to drive to his office to see him.

I decided to think about it since I had already contacted the other law firm. On the same day, I got a phone call from the other law firm's case manager who was very nice, but wanted to set up an appointment and for me to drive to Huntington Beach at a time that wasn't convenient. I sent up an appointment, but wasn't fully convinced since it seemed like I was the one pursuing them, doing the follow up, and I wondered if that's the way I would be treated during the whole process.

I decided to contact Jonathan again and let him handle my case, his staff met with me at a convenient time and place and the process began to roll. He also got me in to see the doctor right away and I didn't have to pay anything out of pocket. No more $20 co-payments for visits and medication. The attorney calls to check in with me and so does his case manager/legal assistant. They take the time to answer my calls, emails, and all my questions... even when I ask them twice. At times they are busy, but they are kind and professional enough to set up appointments to talk to me and answer my questions. Their follow up is amazing.

This case finally settled. The settlement process is lengthy, so be patient and know that Jonathan and his staff are taking care of you. I can't disclose the financial settlement, but lets just say it was enough for a down payment on a three bedroom house in a decent area of Long Beach, CA. Thank you for your amazing customer service and attention to details Jonathan! You and your staff made this whole process very easy and thank you for always being so patient with me (even when I asked the same question 3 times).<//Review>

My life turned upside down when an 18 wheeler rear ended me on the freeway, crushing my car and me. I went to the hospital and was in really bad shape for a while and finally went on Yelp to find a lawyer after the emergency room doctor told me I would probably need surgery and the 18 wheeler's insurance company was giving me the runaround. This law firm handled everything for me and the insurance company stopped playing games once they came on board. They won my case and got me a better result than I could have ever hoped for. My life finally got back to normal thanks to their help!< /Text>< Pictures>

<review>Now this is my favorite place for tacos. Yes, its what we call a roach truck. Because it is a lunch truck. But let me tell you something, these tacos are really (the bomb) good. At least for me they are. I've gone to plenty of taco (lunch trucks) places, but this one is the one I will keep going to. And yes, they are following the rules on keeping customers < 6 feet apart >.

Love this place. It's my go to Taco place when visiting Lynwood. It's really called Tacos El Gage. When you order, you. An always ask for cebollas (grilled onions 🌰) they'll add it to your order. On Tuesday's they have 2 for 1 Taco Tuesday special.<//Text>

Great food for a good price. Al pastor burrito is where it's at. Their red sauce is top notch.  I'd say just behind kingg tacos red sauce but the meat quality is better here.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) A lady who charges in the week is very rude, you ask her for the tacos in one way and she gives them to you differently and a horrible genius nothing to do with the many on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, thank you

<Review>We were looking for a verified and reliable database of a very niche sub-industry in the agriculture sector. With DataCaptive, the process of listing down the requirements, placing the order and downloading the database was smooth. They were very keen to take all my requirements. Also, I think they are very strict with adhering to data privacy and security, something not all data providers are well versed in.<//Review><Rating>5</Rating>< Resp>

At first I was not sure with Datacaptive if they can provide me with the list I require because it was very niche. So I bought a trial list of 500 contacts for $500. The list which I received from them was very good I would say 95% in email and phone numbers which I was looking for. Now I have purchased for the second time for more contacts and same result. I am totally satisfied with the service they provided. I am looking for more business in future.

Thank you for your service.

Actually, I wanted something which had flexible plans. To my surprise, DataCaptive does offer a flexible data plan where we can buy database for a month or so and upgrade the plans accordingly. I got one email campaign for 2 months, just to check the quality before making a long-term commitment. Since I am liking the quality, I think I will upgrade my plan once the two months are over. I really like this about DataCaptive.</Text>< Pictures>

The database of DataCaptive is huge, and we felt it will be a great help for our brand if we could use this database to connect with more contacts.  The sales and support team were very cooperative in considering our specifications. We are glad we could build a completely customizable list. We are hoping for great results!</text>

I had never bought any email database for sales. The first time I got in touch with DataCaptive was when they sent me an email about their Christmas offer, where they were giving 30% off on the order amount along with a free email campaign. I got both, and I must say that the quality of the database was amazing. I am yet to analyze the response we are getting, but we definitely hit a jackpot. Highly recommended!</Text>

Highly disappointing when we request a quote from online service providers like zoominfo and uplead. They show us big numbers on the screen while give us unbelievably small numbers in the quote. With DataCaptive, we were assured what they displayed. The phrase that said reach more sell more on their page is not a lie. One of my personal reliable data services is DataCaptive.< /review>

I sent them my requirements through a form, and they got back to me with my exact requirements in just 3 hours! This is impeccable. Also, the sales staff is very up-to-date with the business world and knows a lot about digital marketing. Great stuff.</Review>

<Text>The best thing about data captive is that they offer a range of services under one umbrella, which is usually not the case with the other providers. With data captive, they offer a complete package for the campaigns to hit the right spot. The customer service is good, the executive are professional and know about the business. Data captive will always be my first choice any sort of data management services.< /Text>< name>

My colleague recommended data captive’s for its email campaigns. This is the best decision that I have made. Their service is great, and the customer service team is highly knowledgeable. They helped me so much is framing out my requirements, and were constantly in touch until I downloaded to list. Really appreciate the effort Data Captive!<//review>

The company has made its presence in the google in such a way there are many (about 4-5) different companies with different brands and the goal of all companies is one "TO CHEAT PEOPLE & EARN MONEY".I lost $2000 for a list purchase which is not related to my requirement. Do not proceed with reading all the positive reviews as i feel that is another way which company must have implemented when ever there is a negative review to cover the ratings you will see 2-3 positive reviews posted internally. FAKE PEOPLE, FAKE COMPANY, FAKE ADDRESS.< /review>

We are very happy with Datacaptive. Its mailing database is a great source to generate targeted traffic to our website consistently, every month. The staff at DC is very helpful.

Data Captive was easy to use from the very beginning. Within two weeks of getting the email campaigns from them, our sales and marketing team synced together and the leads started coming in. the return rate was also great. Earlier it took us almost 4-5 months to get to the 50% profit rate, with DC we got it in two months.< /text>

We approached DataCaptive to buy a business contact database to market our cloud-based solution and network and device management services.

My first business with data captive was in June 2019, when I took their data cleansing and enrichment service. They did such a fabulous job then my sales almost multiplied 3 times!
I bought a physiotherapy nurses list recently, and I must say they have outdone themselves. They completely customized my list, and it is so responsive, we are getting good response despite the global pandemic. Thank you Data Captive!</Review>

My biggest pet peeve with data providers is getting irrelevant information. We spend so much of monetary resources on getting the right contacts but it is very rare that data providers offer quality output. Data Captive however has been a pretty good experience so far, the quality is good and the service is also quite okay. However, I will suggest them to work on their delivery time.<//review>

The best thing about data captive is that they offer A-Z data solutions. From lead generation to marketing automation to manage the campaigns, they have everything on their plate. And going by experience, it is always good to go for one who has in depth knowledge of every step of the business. I will definitely choose data captive for this.< /text>

The 5 star reviews are paid for! Look more carefully. They do not provide the products or services promised. I asked for a list of criminal attorneys, they provided a list of attorneys, a minute amount, if any, working for a firm that provides criminal law. They also promise to send an email for you and don’t. Huge scam. Don’t waste your money.</Review>

Everything with DC was smooth and painless. We are into medicine distributions and logistics business, so we need to be constantly up and on about our customers, which is why we contacted Datacaptive for database and lead generation. The pre-sales experience was great. I received a very detailed database and highly responsive leads. I am quite pleased with the post-sales process as well. Overall, it was a positive experience, and I will certainly consider your services again for a future campaign.</text>

<review>The first time I ordered for a cardiology nurses mailing database from Data captive, they messed it up. They sent me completely different one! It was not a good first experience, but they sent me fresh set as soon as I raised a complaint. The quality was fabulous the second time and the quality were also quite impressive.

I got to know about data capptive and its lead generation service through a former colleague of mine. He had really good things to say about the customer support team and the quality of service offered by data captive. So, I bought a set of email campaign and lead generation service from them. It's been eight months now. Despite Covid19 effects, we are generating good revenue, thanks to data captive!<//review>

My firm is into human resource recruitment for medical institutions. Hence, we required related email list focusing on targets all over USA. Data captive did a great job in sourcing list of related job titles which would have otherwise taken a long time on our own. The response we are getting from the targets is pretty great till now. We look forward to using others services from data captive as well.</Review>

To be very honest, the quality of email data that I got in my first order was not expected. First I thought of letting it go, but then I though I must speak up as a customer. I let them know about my experience, and they were very kind to resend my a new set of campaigns. actually I did not know that they customize each email set according to the requirements sent to them. Since I did not specify my requirement, what I got was probably of low quality. But the second set was impeccable, and equally good is their customer service. Unlike other sites where customers are not valuable after the payment is being made, the folks at datacaptive were in touch with me continuously and made sure I got what I paid for. I like this kind of positive vibe in a business. I wish them good luck!< /review>

It has been a pleasure working with Data captive. I have found the company very responsive and quick to do whatever it takes to meet high customer satisfaction levels. When we discovered that some of the contacts of our list buy were undeliverable, Span was quick to replace them even though they had already met their deliverability guarantee.</text>

DC has been a consistent pillar of support for the growth of our business across Sweden. Their business experts helped us in reaching to a better height and understand the importance of data accuracy for successful marketing. We increased our organic traffic to our website nearly ten times during the course of our campaign.</review>

Data captive has been the go-to data provider for all the database needs of my organization in the past two years now. Despite the COVID pandemic, Data captive’s email campaigns got us good results. They really do a great deal of research before setting up a database and designing a campaign. Definitely look forward to keep doing business with them.<//review>

The price they quote for their email list is fair, and the result is good. I have succeeded in targeting over 50k new customers using their list. Great response! Thank you, data captive!<//Review>

<review>The first email list I bought from data captive was on technology- SAP users list in America. When it performed beyond our expectation my team bought another one, but due to some miscommunication, they delivered us a completely different list. However, they readily accepted their mistake and delivered us the correct list in just 2 days. I am so impressed by the diligence of their customer service! Really impressive!</review><Time>1600351805550</Time>< gmapID>

<Text>My hospitality business was impacted greatly during to the covid 19 pandemic, and I know I had to get an email list or targeted campaign set to bounce back. I bumped into Data Captive through an article, it was really informative and great! Anyway, I got a CEO email list of USA from them two months ago. It's too soon to talk about the response, but yeah, the service was good overall. Their sales people are also professional.

<text>The whole process at datacaptive is so simple, that is what I like the most, I just to fill the form mentioned in their website. They probably got all my information from that form, they got back in touch with me within 2 days. I had my requirement framed in my mind, but I think they customize the email because the customer service guy repeatedly asking me if I need any assistance with my email list and campaigns. Also, they are really attentive. Even though the whole process was very smooth and easy for me, they kept calling me until the email lists were delivered and I integrated into my tool.<//text>< gmapID>

Mine is a medium size business. So I had never thought of buying a mailing list, thinking it will affect my budget. But since my marketing efforts were going haywire, I bought their industry wise email list. After I got it, I realize that the returns that you is actually great for the price you pay. Businesses must think of long-term solutions always.</Review>

The first email campaign set that I received from data captive was of very low quality. I was really disappointed in the service, and got in touch with their team. However, they were really very responsive and accepted their mistake. They sent a fully customized list, just as I wanted absolutely free of cost. It was the first time I had done business with a company that was so professional and particular about their quality and delivery. Obviously, the second list turned out to be of high quality. So, no regrets!</Text>

Obviously, it is natural to be skeptical while buying anything from the internet. I had invested in expensive marketing campaigns, email lists, business databases etc. in the past and the result I got most of the time was terrible. I stumbled upon a blog published by data captive when I was doing my research for a new service provider. The blog was such an interesting that I decided to try their sample data. The response I got was beyond belief. I am definitely going to try out their marketing services in the future.< /text>

I am very particular about the things that are usually recommended. Because I feel unless we try things on our own it is difficult to trust anyone. But here I would really want to share my experience with Data captive. Their services are surprisingly good, they respond on time, and their data is cost efficient (Isn't this what we want). You can try them out yourself.< /text>

<text>I have been using Data Captive for 3 years now. Earlier we faced a lot of loss of leads mid-way, owning to lot of fake and mismanaged database. However, data captive’s lead generation and email campaigns have helped us structure our master database. Now our CRM is well up-to-date and sales is also great.< /text>< rating>

I have been dealing with data providers from quiet a long time and one among them is DataCaptive. I started purchasing from them when they had initially started there business and even till this date I have been buying their datasets. By this you can tell that the team is competent and efficient.< /review>

<text>We bought the retail Industry email list, with specific target locations. The database was legitimate and precise, the bounce rate was minimum than expected. However, the delivery of the list was delayed for a few days, I hope they work on this and improve it. Apart from the delay, I don’t think we faced any other difficulty.< /text><resp>None</resp><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

<review>Datacaptive was suggested to me by a colleague. I just bought a healthcare email list from them. It has so much of information here- diff countries, diff organizations, diff sectors. I should have bought this sooner.

Our post covd-19 plan to get back in the business was to target a very specific sector of audience. By investing in the healthcare and B2B company data from DataCaptive, we could almost immediately register that our marketing budget was not going haywire. Thanks DataCaptive!< /Text>

<text>When it comes to purchasing data, we need to be sure about every aspect. The decision-making process consumes a lot of time. We should ensure that the time and energy we invest should compensate with data that is up to the mark. Our team researched DC a little before we bought the data from them. And they won our trust.

I own a medium sized business, and until a year back I had absolutely no idea that we can buy customized for marketing campaigns. we followed the traditional method of data collection, which was tedious, costly, time consuming and also inaccurate. I bumped into datacaptive when I was reading a blog about ways to improve marketing. I was sceptical, so at first I made a small purchase. The database was of such high quality! My marketing campaigns using that database got such good response. Now I buy my yearly stock of email list from datacaptive. Its been two years and I plan to continue buying from them.<//Review>

Dont do any kind of business with this company, they use some random names and create database and they will sell the database. I have purchased a database related to software users, which includes only fake Mail id's. I tried to contact them but they are not even responding. And also i went to the office location, but the registered office address they gave is fake. there is nothing in that location. THEY CREATED FAKE DATABASE, FAKE COMPANY ADDRESS, FAKE COMPANY PHOTOS.
KINDLY DONT DO ANY KIND OF BUSINESS WITH THEM.</review>

We had purchased the Technology users email list from datacaptive. It was  impressive that the team delivered the list on time as promised without any delays and with authentic contacts which in turn increased our conversion rates than expected. They are doing an excellent job during this difficult time hatts off.

Keep up the good work!!< /text>

Dc has exciting offers for its customers for all the occasions, be it Christmas, Halloween or anything. But we get great deals at one time of the year that are incomparable, is none other than Black Friday. This time we are looking forward to avail various lists. So we are very excited for the sale.<//review>

I have recently done business with Data Captive and it was a pleasant experience I asked them for a Healthcare email list and they connected me to their business development executive who helped me by asking for my requirements and once I specified them, they got back to me with the link for payment. I received the list I required the list within a few days.< /Review>

< Review>
Requested for a custom-made database for our industry and was sorely disappointed.  It was inaccurate and included irrelevant contacts to make up the numbers. When we reached out to solve the problem it took weeks to get back to us. This made us lose out on business, we lost money on the database, plus there was no customer support - where they promised 24 hour responses for data queries.
When we finally heard back from DataCaptive they apologized - offered us other services, which we did not want, then carried on delaying responses to other emails sent.
Do not use this company if you are hoping to move quickly and professionally.< /Review>

The deliverability rate was slow for the database we had requested. Initially we were dissatisfied as it delayed our process but once we received the database, the information was accurate but the response rates were not as accurate as we were promised. It is then that we contacted Dc support team and they had suggested there email automation campaign. We were first uncertain about this option but looking at the situation we went forward with it. Unexpectedly the response rate increased not totally to the top but it was worth the investment. It definitely helped us to tap into a lot of companies to collaborate with and extend our services</review>

I had placed a request for Chief Operating Officer Contact database of 2500 numbers from data captive. The emails I received didn’t belong to the criteria. However when I contacted the support team, they got back after three days and apologized. I received the proper contacts thereafter. The data was exactly 80% accurate</Review>

We need to be very careful while availing data online. I was skeptical to buy data online but when I came across this platform I thought it isn’t that bad that I thought it would be. Instead their data turned out to be very helpful to us. I thought it is risky to put in your money into online business. But this time it was worth the risk.< /review>

Datacapative did not meet the deadlines to provide the email listing and when provided, some of the data was inaccurate. It would be helpful if there was more research done before sending in the information to us. Or they should have a verifying system that cleans out inaccurate data saving us the time to do the research ourselves.</Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< Gmap_id>

Opted for Dc Healthcare database and was satisfied with their services related to accurate data to engage with leads however there was a discrepancy in merging the marketing and sales funnel which caused a chain link to be broken and it took us a lot of time to solve the problem. The customer care was slow and did not aid in solving the matter right away. But I must say that in spite such a delay our issue was submitted and we received daily reports on the process and finally the issue was solved and even after that the Dc team kept a follow up on how things were going on and if any further help us needed from them. Though the process was tiring the result was worth the wait.< /Text><UserId.>102372777285791173300</UserId.>< name>

I have made two purchases from datacaptive. The data provided by them is fairly good. However, I would suggest them to improve their product pages and simplify it. It becomes little difficult to browse through all the lists and then get what I want.</Review>

I had sky high expectations from the datasets that we purchase. I thought 100% of datasets that we receive was authentic. But when I spoke to other marketers, I realized that it was just a myth. That was exactly the case with DC as well. They promised 96% data accuracy but almost 15% of their data was inaccurate.

But when I switched over to another provider, I realized Dc was far better, at least their assistance and conduct with their customers is good!</Text>

Poor and unprofessional business practices. DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY- they provide irrelevant data and claim that their contacts are viable. Purchased for recruitment and was provided only phone numbers to the candidates companies they currently work for rather than their requested contact information.  They will not refund the money as stated in an email when I initially questioned poor Better Business Bureau Reviews for this exact same thing.  Please search this company and read their official reviews.</Text>

DataCaptive delivered only half the number of contacts that were paid for and then refused to refund us for the difference. The list received had lots of redundancies, required extensive cleaning, and data was badly out-of-date for many contacts. Unprofessional and dishonest - they took the money and ran.</review>

I was surfing through the net to avail ABM services that is in demand in the business. But before jumping into any conclusion I wanted to make sure this is the right decision that I’m making. It is then when I came across the blog “Implementation of ABM in E-commerce” in Datacaptives website. It helped me in getting a clear picture about the ABM concept and then I bought their service. I was skeptical about the expenditure but they charged exectly what I was promised (NO ADDITIONALY CHARGES… YAY). It was nice working with the DC team.<//Review>

However, being a startup, we weren’t able to afford their database. I spoke about the same with their executive and they were kind enough to come up with a customized deal for my requirement. But I wasn’t completely happy with the datasets that I received. I contacted their agent Rob and he helped me out in correcting the confusion. He educated me on using the dataset in a better way.< /review>

But I want share my experience so that this misinterpretation does not affect your decision. When I was facing an issue with accessing the data, I approached Datacaptive through live chat directly because I thought that was the fastest way to get a response and I made it through. I was told that their BDM will get back to me regarding my problems. And they actually responded within a day and with their cooperation, my issue was solved. So all that I can tell is don’t believe in false acquisitions and go try them out yourself.

Also, a tip for you.. Instead of sending them text heavy mails, contact them through live chat. Trust me it works.< /text>< gmapID>

<review>All the reviews here are fake. So are the Linkedin profiles of people that 'work' at Datacaptive. The BDR that approached me, Edwin Kagoo, doesn't exist. The office building in Santa Clara they claim to be in is permanently closed. The amount of work put in to make this look like a real company made me raise my eyebrows. Do yourself a favour and ignore them.<//review><Name>Tim Fresen<//Name><response>None< /response></record>

<review>I am managing a small start-up but to give a kick start to it, we needed contact details of our prospects. I searched for the same on web and came across websites of several B2B data providers and Datacaptive too was one among them. I asked for Demo from all the websites but was very much impressed with the one provided by Datacaptive.

However, being a startup, we weren’t able to afford their database. I spoke about the same with their executive and they were kind enough to come up with a customized deal for my requirement. But I wasn’t completely happy with the datasets that I received. I contacted their agent Rob and he helped me out in correcting the confusion. He educated me on using the dataset in a better way<//review>< pictures>

Datacaptive’s Data cleansing services had helped us improve a lot. We were looking to undertake data driven marketing and thus had our data verified. A majority of our data was found to be obsolete/ unusable. We then reached out to for the data cleansing services. We received the updated data within a week< /text>

<Text>We bought a list from Datacaptive few weeks back and I am satisfied with the quality they provide. I received good click rate and response in my email campaign.

There agent Rob contacted me with a list of contacts for sale, there was a lot of promises that the data was of good quality, was verified and processed. He sent me a very long email with all the details about how accurate they are with data.

He sent me a sample list which was very good

I paid $1000 upfront, thats when the problems started....

I checked the first 350 emails on the list, only 170 of them passed verification, of the 170 only 35 emails were accepted.

I tried calling the list, and half of the contacts had left their position or were located in a completely different role.

I have been asking them for 4 weeks for a refund as the data provided was basically junk.

They have refused to refund me and have now blocked all emails form my domain so i can no longer reach them.

If you want good quality data thats usable then i would stay well away form these crooks< /text>

DataCaptive’s service is excellent & is one of its kind. It may not be 100% perfect of course but it's indeed extremely good. Getting directly connected to our prospects is really important for our business. With DataCaptive, it is so much simpler to get connected directly with people than having to call the main company line and try to get transferred. I found a number of prospects & leads which was not possible with any previous tool I had used. Way to go DataCaptive! Keep Up The Good Work!<//Review>< Pictures>

The list was totally unusable. Not to mention it was probably the worst customer service experience I've ever encountered. They offered to update the list and then provided a second list which had almost a 95% bounce rate. After speaking with a manager we were told we would be given a refund, then we received an email from the "grievance team" letting us know that a refund would not be processed. They gave us no reason and there wasn't even a name on the email to contact. I've tried calling twice today and each time I've been disconnected. NEVER USE DATA CAPTIVE.</Review>

<text>Scam! Paid $300 for a List of healthcare professionals in 3 States. Took them 4 Days to email it to me and it was just a bunch of names that they put a dot in between first and last name then put @ and list a random medical websites. I thought maybe that's the medical industry. Sent 130 and within 45 seconds I received over 100 as undeliverable.  Plus, of my 500 guaranteed in 3 states, only had 130 from my states that I ordered. Called Alvin and he said he would let me know about it the next day. Apparently everything takes multiple days for them except the invoice they send you. It comes immediately and you will hear from them 4 times in 2 hours until you log in and pay.</text>< pics>

<text>Do not purchase lists from the company. They "sell" you bogus lists, do not follow up their your word, and when you express your disappointment and expectations, they ignore you. Our company purchased a list of medical professionals who were sold to us as being in the job market. Once we obtained that this, we found out that nearly 100% of the contact information was incorrect and our bounce back rate was higher than 85%. They were unable to tell me how up to date the list was and when the last time they scrubbed it. They promised to present a new list. A week and a half went by, I reached out several times asking for an update on the list with no response, was told someone would call me back and they didn't. This company is a HUGE waste of time to work with and their customer service is awful!!!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< user>

SCAM!!! BUYER BEWARE!!!

They reached out to our company claiming they had an email list from a convention that related to our industry.  We purchased the list for $250 and after receiving it, it was clear they had just collected random emails. We gave them the benefit of the doubt tho and uploaded the list to our email sending service (mailchimp).  It was immediately flag for being spammed emails.  Do NOT trust Data Captive!</review>

Please stay away from this scam. They are the most unreliable and unprofessional. They took 2700 dollars from us and supplied us with the list 3 weeks late and it was incorrect. They then attempted to correct it but sent us the same exact list 2 weeks later. They are a scam please do not deal with them. Alvin Wiseman and Andrew Strauss were the contacts with this company.<//text>

<Text>Test file = 100% competitors. Asked for them to provide list without competitors. 1 file of 2000 contacts = 25% competitors. They did not respond to my requests via email and phone to fix the file. Reported it to PayPal. They then responded with 2nd file that then had 28% competitors. They forced PayPal to take my money and PayPal never contacted me about why I was disputing the issue. Don't do business with this company unless you use a credit card or debit card. PayPal is worthless in protecting you. Data Captive is the worst company to work with. Non-responsive and did not honor their commitment to the product to be delivered.< /Text>< resp>

<Text>We went in to retail and tried to gain the B2B market share for our Travel and Kitchenware clients. We used Datacaptive for our marketing campaigns and had a conversion rate upwards of 11%. What we did was upload the list for ads in to our DMP and our Social Media as custom audience segment and that was it and we now order regular custom segments from Datacaptive. One thing is for sure those who use emails in mailchimp etc. have no idea of digital marketing and how it needs to be executed.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

(Translated by Google) Scam alert. Scam. We bought a supposedly qualified database and they sent something that had almost nothing to do with it. Paypal agrees with them since you sign a Docusign that is misleading and does not bother to look further. Absolute deception

Rude, uneducated employees, no customer rewards program. Special orders come pretty fast (like next day) but there always seems to be a problem when picking up. Disrespected many times in this store. Save yourself the headache and go to Auto Zone down the street.</Text>

I love this place! They have exceptional customer service! My headlight was out, so I went here to purchase a new one. Edgar was nice/kind enough to replace it for me. He is a lifesaver! Also, I bought windshield wipers from here before and they replaced those for me, as well.< /text>

<text>I'm not sure what happened to this particular oreileys, however the customer service here has declined since I moved to the area. The last couple visits, the salespeople have been very short and not very friendly. In contrast to the one on Navajo Rd. Every one there is always helpful and friendly. I hope this one turns around soon.< /text>< GmapID>

<rating>1</rating><Review>Robert was on counter. Rude & does not want to help you , if I don't have receipt. My car did not start this morning & mechanic said starter was bad.
So I went to this  location in the morning & bought a starter & guy told me my damage starter has life time warranty because it has oreilly part number & I purchase from oreilly before. If I bring back bad starter I will get full refund back for the new one I purchased this morning.
Yes I did not have receipt for the old one that was purchase months back. But he can check from part number to verify if it was oreilly part but Robert decline to do so.

Just makes a day worse , having to deal with a guy like him .< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<response>None< /response><text>It's a literal migraine to deal with this people... There's always a way around your "warranty" anything they can do to not honor the warranty... They will sure do... They will rip you off and act like its your fault, every part I have bought there and later need to replace under warranty has been denied, for the stupidest reasons e.g "you were supposed to buy a separate part that goes with what you bought for it to have warranty, or, you need your receipt because I can't find you in the system... Oh my bad I made you struggle 3 days but I found you"!!! Nothing like autozone!!!</text>< Pictures>

Employees make you wait, and when they finally get to you they are not helpfull at all. They will rudely point you to an alias and you're on your own.</review>

< Review>
Worst network ever.  It might be a continuation of the WB, but nothing it put out compares to the WB's programming.  This network was a huge mistake, right from the start.  Someone said, "too much/many dramas on the CW," in the reviews.  There is little to no comedy or other types of programming.  Outside of prime time, it's trash talk, boring/cookie-cutter court shows, no name/don't care talk shows, and infomercials instead of movies (or quality programming).  The majority of Americans hate what's on TV these days.  I'm surprised the CW has been around this long.  Haven't watched a single night or day of programming, ever and won't.< /Review>

<user_id>112293452378807747872<//user_id>< review>
We went here for the first time one night when my Mom was craving for shrimp tacos.  The lady in the front was very nice.  She patiently explained what comes with an order of Shrimp Taco Plate.  Although she said 15 minutes wait, it took only 10 minutes before my order was ready.  one order of Shrimp Taco Plate comes with 3 soft tacos, 3 pieces of battered shrimp for each taco, a generous amount of veggies, 4 battered jalapenos and 4-5 potato slices.  The potato burst with a spicy concoction inside!  The platter came with salsa on a separate container.  The only thing I feel I was missing was the avocado.   But still this food is delicious!  It is sooo fresh!  Reviewing this makes me hungry now and crave for more.  Will definitely order again.  The lady said they don't deliver but she informed me that I can order through doordash.  Next time we will of course try Fish and Chips!❤️❤️❤️. Thank you Dish and Chips for a scrumptious meal!😋😋😋<//review>

<text>My family and i love the food we love the place have been customers for years now my mom has known the owners for years and i hate to give them a bad review but the manager is very rude and has no sense of customer service, also now with all the regulations due to covid the restaurant is very unorganized it's ridiculous that there is not a separate line for pick up, indoor dining, ordering or their online delivery services. 20 minutes to pick up and order that has already been placed defeats the purpose of pre ordering. I thjnk there needs to be work on their management and organization.<//text>< pictures>

We've driven by this place countless times since moving to Salinas several years ago and finally stopped in to check it out.  The fish is clean and a nice batter,  the fries are golden crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy inside.  I can't wait for in restaurant dining to resume so we can try it straight from the kitchen rather than from home.<//Text>

I came in this morning with a really good friend of mine N he has never been to fish N chips so anyway we went in N asked if we could sit outside N the two young ladies that worked there were very polite N helpful N respectful N said yes we can sit outside N while we were waiting for our food in the rain lol a young lady employee came outside N started up a heater for us to warm up N that is why I am here that she was more then willing to exceed her duty at work N be very kind infront of me N my best friend N made our experience great! The menudo N pozole was great as well as there chavelas N great customer service!! Thankyou soo much to the 2 young ladies N cooks for our pleasurable experience introducing my best friend to fish N chips!

Now I have to say this place definitely has all bases covered their fish and chips just as I remember from the original one in town on Alisal then your Mexican food right on the money but they also serve other items like burgers , just know that you will  be pleased with whatever you order and if you like menudo this is your spot on the weekend. For anyone that doesn't know where this place is and your from Salinas it's the old Skippers building.</review>

I had been craving some fish and chips for a while and gave into my wants. I was not dissapointed.  Their fish was so deliciously tender and juicy. While their fries/chips provided a wonderful contrast. They were perfectly golden and crunchy with the right amount of spices. These are the type of fries/chips that can stand on their own, flavor wise, without any ketchup. I was overtly pleased with this Fish and Chips location. Will definitely visit again.< /review><user_id>118150773065751358050<//user_id>< rating>

<review>Oddly enough this is a great place for menudo. Menudo is available on weekends only and you get a good serving with tortillas or bread. The service is great but the coffee could use a bit more love. I've only had the menudo here so I can't comment on the rest.< /review>< pics>

<Rate>2< /Rate><review>The food is great as usual, but the person who took my order was very rude, when I asked her if the accepted debit cards, her response was not " yes sir", she said " well if you money in your account, we do".   Once there, I walked in through the back door, there was an elderly couple walking in front of me.   The lady at the counter said to them" if you are eating in, you must get in line, over there".  The elderly lady said " oh the line is very long, and he cannot stand for long periods of time".  The answer killed me, she was told " but you can, let him sit here, and you go get line, when are next, he can join you".   Come on, what does this say to your elderly clientele?  Rules are rules, but no rule is written on stone, I take that back, 10 rules are, but no more.   You should want to feel your customers welcomed, NOT REJECTED.    I can assure you they will not be back, and after being your customer from day one, I will not be back either.< /review>< pics>

Food is really good but the service is terrible. Been there a few times but had to walk out the let time since they sat us and offered no service for 15 minutes. Waitresses walked by and ignored us.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x808dff120feb0dcb:0x2a25964f960f4f</GmapID><Review>The food was good. When I first sat down the server gave us a napkin 2 spoons and 2 forks. I noticed one of the spoons were dirty. I kindly ask for another spoon. She left and came back with the same spoon she walked away with. After wiping the spoon with a napkin. This is not acceptable. We ordered our food it came out very quickly. She told us the grill is about to be closed. So we kinda felt rushed. A family of 6 came in 10 minutes before closing and order all kinds of food. Apparently the grill wasn't being shut down. She just wanted us to be rushed out. Very disappointed.< /Review>< Response>

The decor has been refreshed and everything but the service I received was lackluster and not up to par. I know this is a little hole in the wall type place but your customers should never feel ignored or dissatisfied with the way they are treated. I don't think I'll be back any time soon.</review>

Nothing extraordinary, but the portions are amazing. The bread to Cod ratio is perfect, and the fries were great. Too much cabbage in the tacos, and not enough fish. The tempura brown potato's need flavor. Salsa is bland, but the texture and size of the vegetables are great. Either way, we'll be back for a second visit.<//review>

From the traditional fish-n-chips to the delicious birria, you have to try it all. (But not all at once, ha!)< /Text>

It had been a while since I visited this location. The place looks the same but when I sat down I was disappointed with how dirty the table and chairs felt. I decided to stay because I wanted menudo and I was starving. The menudo was okay a little flavorless and a little rubbery like it was over cooked. But chile flakes, onion, salt and lemon can make anything halfway decent. I would have gave this place a 2 but my lady had the fish and chips and it was actually pretty good. The fries and batter were crisp and the fish was flakey and had good flavor.<//Text>

<Review>After a busy morning of shopping at the mall, my husband and I decided to stop by Fish and Chip's in Salinas for lunch. The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and the food was amazing! I had the new Cajun shrimp which was out of this world good!!! My husband had the Baja fish tacos...and after sampling my order asked the waitress if he could get some of the Cajun sauce on my shrimp. She asked the cook who proceeded to make a fresh batch of sauce for my husband! The chef, our waitress and all the staff went above and beyond what most restaurants are willing to do for their patrons! We will definitely be back and we will tell all our friends about this precious gem of a restaurant!!!</Review>< Pictures>

<text>Came in for an early dinner with my family before the rush and had to cancel my order. Everyone got there food and of course I didn't make them wait and I still haven't gotten my Birria. I wasn't the only one that canceled there meal today. Not my servers fault, he was cool and had to take his break. The food is really good but service from other not so good.<//text>< Response>

<Text>Fairly nice restaurant where the "locals" eat.  Lots of fried food options...not so many non-fried options... But it is call fish and chips...so that's fried fish and french fries...so I guess it's only fitting.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
3/17/17 - This place has thr best of both worlds. Traditional English Fish & Chips as well as the best Mexican Menudo in Salinas. You will always see a line out the door on Sundays for Menudo as well as other dishes like, pozole, birria and tosadas de camaron.  A little locals only secret is that they serve a hand formed hamburger/cheese burger that is really good too. Not your average frozen party burger at all! Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed!< /Review>
