<Response>None<//Response><rate>5<//rate><Review>I worked with Martin on my recent lemon law case. I was very hesitant going into the process and he was so patient, responsive and informative as he built my case. What I particularly appreciated was how methodical he was in gathering all the background information. He gave me confidence that I had a good case and in the end we got a judgement for the amount we requested.  I was simply amazed that in 10 months I went from feeling taken advantage of by the car dealership to feeling empowered and justified. I was so fortunate that I chose him to represent me.</Review></record>

<Review>Absolutely the most honest, responsive and thorough attorney I have spoke with dealing with a Range Rover lemon. I will not hesitate to use Mike again in the future. He stands out from the other listings because he's a real attorney, not a referral service or advertising page. You will not be disappointed if you call him.</Review></record>

I had never hired an attorney before so I had no idea what to expect. Martin Anderson and Kalman Hutchens were very helpful and informative about the process. They got me through a complicated Lemon Law case with FCA and I would absolutly use Anderson Law Firm again or recommend them to friends and family.</text>

Martin joined my Lemon Law case a few months after it was picked up by another law firm. My lawyer strongly recommended Martin's assistance and I'm very glad we moved forward with his help. He took immediate action and was not going to settle for a penny less than what I was asking. Things got a little messy with the opposing side towards the end, but my lawyer and Martin did not hesitate to stand up for my rights. Although this was a long and stressful journey, I am very satisfied with the outcome. If I need any further legal advice or help (fingers crossed that I don't though!) I will definitely reach out. Thank you so much for all that you've done for me. Strongly recommend giving Martin a call/email for legal help. As he has said, you will have a "bulldog"fighting for you. True to his word!< /review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Martin Anderson’s Law Firm was brought into my lemon law case by David Goldsmith of Goldsmith West, whom I had originally contacted to handle my case. While the process did take a bit longer than what most others have experienced (this was mainly due on the manufacturers part dragging their feet and not a reflection of Mr. Anderson or Mr. Goldsmith’s efforts), both Martin and David were very communicative, courteous, and professional throughout the entire process. Each step was outlined with the correct expectations, and if I ever had a question or asked for a status update, I never felt I was “being a bother”. In the end, Martin was able to negotiate for exactly what I was looking for, and I am very thankful in the decision I made to use their law firms. Thank you Martin and David for your hard work in resolving my case! I hope to never get another “lemon”, but if I do, I know who to contact!</text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1596139582109, 'text': "You're welcome, Ben!

The Anderson Law Firm was brought into my Lemon Law case by the Goldsmith West Law Firm, which I had initially contacted for my case. Apparently they've worked together successfully in the past. Very happy to have Martin Anderson on my case, which ended successfully. I would highly recommend Martin and his law firm for anyone who's ready to take their problems with their vehicle to the next level. Courteous, responsive, motivated, a real professional. Would use again!!<//Review>

To say Martin and Jeff are great is an understatement! I came to them with a lemon law case and they were very honest and didn’t sugar coat a thing! These guys were prompt, organized, and answered all my questions. Most lawyers are hard to contact or take days to return calls but between the two of them, I always received a call or email in a reasonable amount of time. As a result, my case settled shortly (so I would say) and I am MORE than happy. They got everything I asked for and I’m grateful! Hopefully I’ll never need them again, but in the event I do, I know who to call!< /text>

Martin Anderson was extremely helpful to my wife and i as we navigated the legal issues of having been sold a new car that was under recall but not disclosed to us.  He provided great advice and we go the transaction reversed and 100% of our money back from the dealership in less than a week.< /text>

<review>After calling nearly a dozen lemon lawyers who either did not return my call or told me that my case was too ambiguous, Martin assured me that I definitely had a lemon law case and that it just took a little more effort than normal cases, apparently which the other lemon lawyers were not willing to do. Martin was very thorough and careful throughout my case, quickly informing me if there were any new information or issue that arise. He answered ALL of my questions I had whenever I called him, no matter how mundane or simple the questions may be. His associate Kalman was also a tremendous help, helping me ASAP if Martin was busy at the time. It took nearly a year to resolve my case but Martin and Kalman got it done. I hope I do not have to go through this situation ever again but if I do I will definitely be calling Martin and Kalman once more.</review><Pics>None</Pics><name>Mark Nguyen< /name>< Time>

While they were reviewing all my documents, the manufacturer finally agreed to a buyback.

<text>Last week I called Martin, a lemon law attorney, with some questions involving a lemon law case that I have. He was recommended to me by close friends who hired Martin in their own case which he settled very successfully recently. Martin was exceptionally helpful to me in explaining how certain items would be calculated, what questions I needed to ask the representative in order to make an informed decision, and what issues I might be able to use to better the outcome in my own case. He was extremely generous with his time and I truly appreciated his

I have never had to use an attorney before for anything, but when I needed one for a lemon issue with my truck, I contacted Martin.  He graciously gave me thirty minutes of his time for a consult.  After again trying to resolve my issue with Dodge, I hired him on my behalf.  At all times, Martin and Jeff were extremely professional, friendly and supportive of the issue I was dealing with.  They were also extremely responsive to all e mails and phone calls and kept me informed at all stages of the case.   After all of their hard work, we had a successful outcome with my case.  Martin and Jeff exceeded my expectations and wouldn't think twice about hiring them again on my behalf.<//Review>

I cannot thank Jeff and Martin enough for everything they did for us. After being told there was nothing we could do about our case, they took over and made sure we got what we deserved. Always professional,  ready to answer all of my questions. They are truly the best.  I'm a very busy mom of 2,  going to school ,and having a full-time job, Jeff and Martin made it easy for me to do everything around my time. I cannot stress enough, if you ever need help in a lemon law case these are the guys you want by your side. They are knowledgeable, professional and truly care about their clients.</review>

Wish there were more stars to give. Even though I was able to settle with BMW without having to use Anderson Law firm, Jeff still assisted me  for no charge along the way.  When he read my buyback letter from BMW, he informed me that I was entitled to my registration reimbursements. He even sited the California Lemon Law which I used in my rebuttal letter. The next buyback letter that I received from BMW increased $450 due to Jeff's knowledge and generosity. I wish there was more I could do and or say for this firm because they are truly good, honest people. You will have no regrets if you decide to use them. Thanks again Jeff! Amy</Text>

Martin and Jeff are experts when it comes to lemon law. They took me through a step by step process to document my case and gave me wise counsel each step of the way. When we finally filed a lawsuit, the automaker settled the case within 30 days of the filing of the lawsuit thanks to Martin and Jeff. I was able to recuperate every penny I spent on my car including down payment, monthly payments, rental car expense, etc etc without having to pay for any deductions. They are kind, sharp, and very knowledgeable in all aspects of lemon law. I would highly recommend them if anyone is looking for a lemon law attorney. My wife and I were totally satisfied and thankful for Martin and Jeff.</text>

<text>I was very pleased with this firm and the lemon law case they handled for me for starters!
I had a 2011 Ram 1500 that was one of the worst nightmares I've ever owned. After getting the run around from multiple different dealers I decided to look into lemon law attorneys. After a few firms I called that I never got through to, Jeff Kane at Anderson's firm was the first one to pick up. After a brief phone call I felt immediately assured as Jeff explained his experience in being a lemon law attorney and previous background being a certified mechanic and knowledge of dealerships. Then I went online and checked previous reviews which came back all positive. After emailing over all the paper work I had on my truck Jeff got back to me promptly and I decided to move forward and let them take on our lemon law case.
To make a long story short, both Martin and Jeff are an extremely good team. They are professional, courteous, and very knowledgeable. It was amazing how they called out every single move Chrysler would make beforehand, and sure as day that's what happened.
My advice if you're looking to hire an attorney, pick this firm. Follow every direction they give, be up front and honest about your vehicle, and if they tell you that they think you should make a certain choice, do it, because at the end of all of it, they were able to get me a lemon law dealer buy back and I got all my money back from my truck!< /text>< gmapID>

<Review>Mr. Anderson was a huge help to me and my case. We determined my issue wasn’t something I need him to represent me for but he was stilling willing to spend an additional 20 minutes on the phone helping me with my case. This was after we determined he wasn’t going to represent me. He also emailed me some pertinent case law information to help me since I was negotiating directly with the manufacturer. That was way more than what I would have expected from someone not representing me. 5 stars!! I highly recommend calling him if you need a lawyer.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1558747422236, 'text': "I'm so glad that I was able to help you with your lemon law issue.

<Review>I was introduced to Mr. Martin Anderson through California Lemon Law in Glendale, CA. My car was literally trying to kill me while driving and after multiple attempts to fix it with the dealership the same issue kept happening. Mr. Anderson took on my case and handled it without becoming a nuisance to me. I basically forgot about it until I received the call/email that my case was completed and what my next steps were.

Thank you Martin and his associates for being such a great legal team, professional, personable, knowledgeable, charismatic, and most of all patient. I had a lot of questions and basically needed to have my hand held during this process but they were so amazing about it and took on my questions and concerns like champs. THANKS!!</Review><name>anahid shirvanian</name>< userid>

Martin Anderson was very successful in getting my lemon law case settled. I sent them all my information and they did all the work. It really was that simple! I got a full refund for my 2015 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk (minus mileage). I highly Martin -- he is professional, friendly and got the job done!<//text>

If I could give them 10+ stars I definitely would. Anderson Law went above and beyond what we expected to happen with our case. It was handled faster than planned and went very smooth. Great communication from them and very helpful along the way. They did what other law firms said wasn’t possible. I would definitely recommend them. Thank you again with all your help!<//text>

Such a genuine, honest  and hard working  lawyer.
I have never met someone like him nor do I think I ever will. He explains everything in a way you can understand. It’s always easy to get a hold of him when you have a concern or question.< /review>

This is the Lemon Law Lawyer that you want.
I contacted Martin Anderson about my lemon car situation and I can honestly say that Martin followed through on everything that he said he would do.
No promises, just the factual steps of my lemon case.
He will walk you through all the confusing legal talk, which I did not understand.
I chose Anderson Law Firm because of all the positive reviews Martin has as a Lemon Law attorney.
I was not disappointed, Martin handled my Lemon Law problem with complete professionalism.
The Anderson Law firm won my case against the manufacturer, but even if he had not won, I knew where we stood with my case every step of the way.
Lastly, when you call the Anderson Law Firm;
Martin is the one who answers, or returns your call
as soon as possible.
When you email Martin, he is the one who responds
to your inquires.
You can be confident that it will be Martin Anderson that handles your lemon law case the entire way to its conclusion.</text>

<text>When I realized my 2 ½ year old Volvo XC90 was defective and a true lemon after the dealership mechanics repeatedly couldn’t fix it, I knew I needed to find a lawyer who was highly experienced in this particular field of California law and was able to get results.  I did my share of research on CA lemon law and knew little of what to expect, but I quickly realized I wouldn’t be able to get the outcome I wanted without finding a lemon law lawyer.  My searches over and over brought me to the same law firm - one highly rated, successful lemon law attorney.

Martin W. Anderson Law Firm exceeded my expectations as he and his team always returned phone calls and emails very promptly – even answering my questions after hours and on weekends!  His law firm is very professional, honest and reliable offering singular expertise and ideal service to help navigate you through a complicated legal process.

Martin guided me through the process of Volvo repurchasing my XC90, while being upfront and direct about the prospects for a successful outcome so my expectations were realistic and fair.   From our initial discussion all the way to satisfactory resolution, he was thorough, responsive, and very diligent in dealing with my questions and concerns.    I highly recommend Martin W. Anderson Law Firm for ALL your lemon law questions!<//text>< userid>

So unfortunately I ended up needing to find a lawyer for a lemon law case with Hyundai. Ended up calling and speaking to Martin here at The Anderson Law Firm and five minutes into the phone call I had already had more help with this than any other lawyers in the weeks and time we've spent sending documents and emails across. Still currently in the process of getting the car aspect taken care of but Martin and partner Jeff have been such a positive aspect to this very annoying situation with a big automotive manufacturer. These two are extremely smart, keen to current law here in California, and will answer their phone, or respond to an email or text in no time. I surprisingly ended up finding them on Google which is far-fetched to say the least but in the end I'm so glad that I did. These guys are the two you want on your side if you have any time of concern such as this. They have our best interest at heart and want nothing more but to have us and them succeed. The more this process goes forward the less worried I am having them in my corner. It's good to know there are still good people in this world looking to help the little guys out against the big corporates of this country. I highly suggest these two win or lose in this situation and if you're reading this and need legal help, look no further! Thank you Martin and Jeff!< /Text>

I knew very Little about California's Lemon Law or what to do when the dealership refused to correct a faulty warranty repair it made to my 18 month old new vehicle.  I looked online for Lemon Law attorneys and interviewed several over the phone. I found Martin Anderson's name, and after researching his web-site, reviews and speaking with him I chose Martin's Law firm.  It turned out to be a great choice.  Within only five and a half months (most of these cases can take up to a year) Martin had my case settled and I received full buy-back of my vehicle.  Martin kept me informed of the status of my case as it moved along, and answered any and all questions I had.  No one wants to be in the situation of hiring an attorney to take on a big auto manufacturer - but if you do find yourself in this situation, you want Martin Anderson as your attorney.  Very Satisfied !< /text>

<text>They are most experienced lemon law team. My phone call was answered by an attorney. I didn’t have to wait for a call back. Martin has over 20 years experience winning lemon law cases. I spent time calling other firms that barely called me back or lack of knowledge on the law with my vehicle. Definitely give Martin a call if your experiencing the headache of dealing with the manufacturer like I have. He will help you through it. Thanks again!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Martin Anderson and Jeff Kane are two of the best attorneys out there, period.  In fact, over the course of our own case we learned that Martin Anderson has had two of his cases make their way to the California Supreme Court, and that he himself has argued before the California Supreme Court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeal.

That's the kind of leverage you want if you're going up against car companies, and that's why this is not your average lemon law firm.

After we found ourselves in the unfortunate scenario of having purchased a "lemon" vehicle, we called the Anderson Law Firm and it was the best decision we could have made.  Martin and Jeff ran with our case and ultimately got us a truly amazing settlement.  Best of all, the entire process required little effort on our part, and they were always willing to take our calls and to help us understand the entire process from beginning to end.  In my opinion, if you have a lemon, you can't do better than to call the Anderson Law Firm.< /Review><Time>1527103791736</Time></record>

Mr. Anderson has provided myself with free advice with an ongoing issue I have had with my 2016 Fiat 500X. He has advised me throughout the process since January 2019 up until now, almost September 2019, without requiring fees or obligations. My husband and I are in the end stages of a car replacement, and he has still offered to represent us if the representative from Sericyle tries to proceed outside the law. I would 100% reccomend this law firm, and especially Mr. Anderson if you ever have any concern regarding Lemon Law proceedings.</Review>

< Review>
I highly recommend Martin when it comes with lemoning a car. I recently lemoned a 2015 BMW I8. I was having serious issues with the car and BMW was lagging with a decision to do a lemon or a repurchase. I finally decided to contact Anderson Law to get the ball rolling. Martin walked me through the process with what to do and the tactics these car manufacturers try to give you the run around. BMW eventually decided to settle with me and do a full buyout. Martin did not charge me anything for the consultation or the advice he had been providing throughout the process. My recommendation for everyone is if you are thinking of lemoning a car, contact Martin. He will literally stick with you from when you start the lemoning process to when you reach a settlement.< /Review>

I was seeking and researching for an attorney that was going to be able to help me and came across Martin Anderson and decided to call his office and schedule a consultation. To my surprise Mr. Anderson answered the phone and offered to do an over the phone consultation with me. I was very surprised I didn't have to deal with an answering machine or a secretary, Mr. Anderson was available to help me from the beginning. He is very professional and is available to HELP you and LISTENS  to you. I highly recommend him.</review>

<Review>What an amazing consultation with Martin Anderson ~ I had specific, detailed,  questions regarding the qualifications that a car qualifies for/meet the lemon law. Martin answered all my questions in a precise, patient manner, and consulted with me for almost an hour. I was in need of finding a lemon law attorney, and based on his over 2 decades of experience in the field of lemon law, I retained his services to represent me. He is amazing ~

I highly recommend, Martin< /Review>< Pictures>

I was looking for information for an upcoming hearing and was referred to this firm. Even though my type of hearing wasn’t something this firm does, Martin shared some insightful information for me to look into. Since this is all new to me, I really didn’t even know where to start. But, Martin went out of his way to email me a few links that may help me. He seemed genuine, listened intently, and gave me some resources. Even welcomed me to call back to ask any other questions. Energies or people like Martin just deserves visibility and recognition.<//text>

<text>I'm dealing with a California lemon law case in Northern California, and after not getting anywhere with the dealership, I decided I should reach out to someone with more expertise in this area of lemon law. So I called California lemon law attorney, Martin Anderson, at The Anderson Law Firm for help. Martin answered the phone right away and was extremely patient as I shared my case. He was also very transparent in outlining my options--based on my rights under the California Lemon Law--none of which pushed me to hire him and pursue a legal case, until that becomes necessary. Not only was he willing to provide my wife and I with the peace of mind that we have another option if things go South on us with the manufacture and local dealer, but he also provided me with some really great tips on how to make our situation more tolerable while we deal with the problem our brand new vehicle has presented. He was very patient, friendly and gave me sound feedback about how this could work if decided to go with getting a refund or a replacement, and overall made me feel very comfortable talking with him--which isn't always the case when speaking with a legal professional. He demonstrated a high level of expertise in the are of lemon laws, here in California, and everything he said lined up with our experience so far with the automobile manufacture. If you are in a situation like mine, where you have a lemon of a vehicle, and you need answers fast, give Martin a call and see how he can help you out with your lemon law case. If things don't go how we need them to over the next few weeks, we'll definitely be reaching out to him with a lemon law case to represent us as our lawyer.</text><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

Very pleased with the legal advice received from lemon law attorney: Martin Anderson. He was helpful in guiding me through my lemon law case and the process and, as a result I was offered a repurchase of my Kia due to his knowledge and expertise. I’m very pleased with the offer and highly recommend Mr. Anderson’s services.</Text>

I contacted Martin regarding a potential case. He was very responsive, very knowledgeable in his field, and very easy to deal with. I had alot of questions, and he took his time to explain very complicated issues in layman terms for me. I would not hesitate to recommend them to anyone needing representation in this area.<//text>

Matrin Anderson and Jeff Kane are outstanding Lemon Law attorneys.  I was referred to them and will recommend them to anyone with a problem   dealing with an automobile defect.  Ford would not buy back my lemon, stating that it did not fall under California Lemon Law.  Well, Marting and Jeff convinced them!  They are both professional, enthusiastic, innovative and obviously winners.  I could not have asked for a better result.  Thanks Martin and Jeff for a job well done!< /text>

I am SO happy I found The Anderson Law Firm online after dealing with a nightmare of a car and unresponsive corporate offices of Kia. I was initially nervous to call a lemon law attorney, Would they take my case? Did I even have a lemon law case? Jeff was so helpful and friendly, my nerves were at ease immediately. The team basically held my hand and walked me through each step in the process of lemon law cases. They genuinely cared about how I was being treated by the vehicle manufacturer. I will continue to tell my friends and family to contact you for any lemon law cases! Thank you Jeff and Martin!< /Text>

Called to talk about the issue with my motorcycle being in the shop for over a month. While my issue is out of the original warranty time (outside lemon law) he still gave me some references and talked with me so that I'd understand the law and what I can do with my current situation. 10/10 would recommend to others.< /review>

Martin Anderson is a very skilled lemon law attorney who has obtained one of the biggest, if not the biggest, lemon law verdict in California, and is also responsible for several published decisions which are very favorable to consumers.  I recommend him highly to anyone who needs the assistance of a lemon law attorney.  Bob Brennan</Text>

Best Lemon Law Attorney in the Lemon Law Biz.  I contacted Martin about a lemon law case for my wifes Ford Explorer. He and Jeff were nothing but professional and they walked us through what to tell ford and how to manage the case going forward. Hopefilly will never need his services again but if that day ever comes, I am glad to have Martin and the entire Lemon Law firm at our disposal< /text>

Martin Anderson is no nonsense. If you have a case he will tell you. If you do not have a case he will also tell you. Mr. Anderson may often be blunt in his assesment. But that assesment is generally spot on. He is a lawyer you can trust to tell you the truth and NOT string you along to try and get money from you. Thanks for your honesty.< /text>

Erik was the customer service rep that assisted me at this AT and T store and he was GREAT! he knew her products well, knew what inventory was in stock, gave satisfactory answers to the questions I had, gave good recommendations to fit my budget and needs, and did it all promptly with a smile and no attitude. We need more customer service reps just like her.  Thank you so much for helping me with my phone today Erik!< /Review>

Best AT&T customer service in the West! If you are looking for someone to help you navigate the best deals and options for your AT&T service plan - you MUST GO to the Orange Mall AT&T location. Christian (the manager) was so patient and easy to get the help I needed for the past month with my iPhone trade in and service plan. I thought my AT&T experience couldn’t get any better than Christian’s excellent management service, then I was greeted by Eric and he served extra blessings to top off Christian’s service, providing the best accessory options for my IPhone 12 Pro Max. Together, they made up for all grief I got from AT&T over the years, there are still good people working for AT&T and Christian and Eric are living proof! Shop at their local store and take a friend with you! My sister and I got the best AT&T customer service anyone could ask for! Because of Christian I actually chose to renew my contract! Ask for Christian or Eric when you go there and tell them I sent you!<//review>

We dealt with Erik at the village way orange location. He was extremely helpful and attentive to all of our needs from a wireless provider. He helped show us all of our options to find the best phones for us at the best prices possible. I would highly recommend if anyone is looking to switch their cellular provider you go in and specifically see Erik.< /Text>

Erik was amazing. I came in after seeing a deal online and walked out with a new IPhone 11. He was very helpful and knew what he was talking about and made my decision super easy and I got a great deal. He was really nice and made our time there fun and informative. I would definitely recommend coming and seeing him for help</review>

One of the employees Erik was extremely helpful. I had spent all day on the phone with customer care at the corporate office and could not get an answer. So I stopped by this location and Erik was about to fix everything within minutes and give me a great deal that keeps me on as a customer. Very friendly and very knowledgeable about his craft. I highly recommend going to this store if you want to go to a physical location.<//text>

He did not try and push me to buy anything that I didn’t want or need. But did inform me of deals that are available to me. Overall it was a great experience. Super helpful!< /Text>< Date>

I had the best customer service experience last night at this AT&T. My fiance and I went to several cell phone stores to find the best fit for us and Frank was amazingly helpful. We were in the store at the same time as a number of other customers and only Frank was working. Normally in this situation, people would grow frustrated but Frank did an excellent job of helping everyone. We are very pleased with this location (and our new phones!).< /review>

Thank you for being so friendly.  I will definitely use this store from now on even thought it is not the closest to my house.<//review>

Service was excellent and very professional. I completed my transaction online. Received my email that my order was ready. Once I entered the store I was in there less than 15 minutes. Received my phone and was able to transfer my data from old phone to new phone with no problem. Store personnel was following all Covid guidelines and again was very nice and professional!< /Text>

Eric, one of the best associates that I have had the pleasure of experiencing.  I was really upset that I damaged my phone again and Eric took the time to one calm me down then he proceeded to give me options that I was not really aware of.  It was a pleasant surprise to meet an associate that was  so helpful and willing to help.  Thank you!</Review>

This is the only AT&T store I frequent in the city. It was also very clean, everyone has masks and there is sanitizer available.</Text></record>

This the the most CLEAN, FRIENDLY store I ever been to. These people need a raise for sure I normally got I Buckner but they have been closed due to pandemic. I’m glad I came here this is my 3rd time at this location they never disappoint. I felt safe.</Text>

<Text>I was new in the USA, I wanted a Sim card, so I could be able to reach my people in Nigeria and also browse the net and chat with friends.

I was  in the US for less than 90 days so I did not want to buy  Locked phone that is get a phone with a plan, I just wanted to be able to get a sim card that I could insert in my phone.Even though it was quite expensive. I got a sim here and the attendant was both nice and helpful.< /Text>< pics>

I initially was going to rate this spot 5 stars because of good customer service and how patient they were with us, but they ripped us off and ended up giving us a completely different plan than what we asked for.</Text>

Went there to switch service from T-Mobile to ATT. We were seen by a team member within 5 minutes. The multi-tas(king), Erik was very helpful and knowledgeable. Ended up switching 4 lines from T-Mobile, for a better price and  with all new phones. Also a better price than what I was told at the ATT location. So far, we are very pleased with the switch. Will recommend.</Text>

They have a promotions get 4 iPhones 11 for FREE with $35 per line and They gave me a $200 Bill Credit for FirstNET.

Absolutely no wait time involved!  I had 3 people trying to assist me in activating an unlocked phone I had purchased and brought into the store.  After several tries they were unable to get it to work.  Overall this was my BEST experience at an ATT store, eventhough they couldn't activate my phone.< /Review>

I was driving by and seen this place, I stopped to look inside and to my surprise it's literally a hidden gem here in my area. I love to try new foods and new places. This was a clean place to start, very open concept. You have to order your food in the front ashes then they bring it to you. There prices are fair, there food is amazing. When you first get your order, you enjoy the presentation, the taste is amazing. Its great flavors, its unexplainable, its exquisite.🍴😃😄
There fries order with mixed chicken and meat. Its amazing. There lentil soup is very good. I also ordered there combo plate. Will recommend to anyone.< /Text>

<text>Our first time trying this place and it was super delicious! The plates are a great amount and everything on the plate was tasty! What I didn't expect but enjoyed was pickled beets and cabbage which added a nice acidity to the whole dish. And don't forget to ask for the garlic sauce cause it just made everything better! My family will definitely be back again! The service was so friendly and the environment was enjoyable nice and quiet. Just what I wanted to unwind on a Friday night with my family after a long work week.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvvO_Lvae7a8wv7TdxjmctsztWQEw-_Oyz2Ipj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80d95a06768a3f1f:0x22a6cb9b79ccfa20</gmap_id></record>

I was going to give 4 starts because I really like this place and the EDGE Mediterranean has alot going for it, but... When I heard that they're bringing in a special bread oven for the flat bread it put them over the top! 5 stars! High scores for the hummus that is fresh and creamy. Carefully prepared chicken shawerma is so juicy and delicious the 2 for 5.50 sandwich deal almost feels like stealing. They follow the philosophy that: if you're going to do something do it the best.  That is evident the second you walk in the door with the mouth watering smell from the kitchen and the elegant decor throughout. There is definitely more than meets the eye when you're driving by so give it a try!<//text>

The 3 person feast has fed me for 4 days and I have enough for another day (plus extra rice). The ground meat kabobs were so well seasoned as was all the extras. Biggest drawback was the pits bread, seemed like store bought but I fried them for crisps and added seasonings. The middle east egg roll (beef) was so yummy. Great value for very good food.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80d95a06768a3f1f:0x22a6cb9b79ccfa20< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The only part of the order that was good was the baklava. We ordered the vegetarian plate with a salad. I could have made the same or better at home. Small amounts of dressing and hummus with the meal. This is definitely my least favorite Mediterranean food restaurant I've been to in San Diego.<//text>

<text>This is my go-to middle eastern restaurant. If you want amazing hummus delicious yellow rice and chicken that is perfection then come here. Everyone who works here is always so helpful and kind. All of the portions are huge so look forward to leftovers that tastes just as great. And don't forget to order the lentil soup it is by far my favorite. I will drive all the way to Spring Valley just for this food.< /text><username>Ed Adel Oro (Ed)<//username><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Excellent food. I loved the ground beef but I wasn't in love with the ground chicken.  Just my personal taste.  With service, price and quality of ingredients I really love this place.  I will give an update upon my next to couple of visits.  By the way the staff was super helpful in helping pick my order.
11/08/2016 followup to last review.  The lamb over rice was splendid and service was still amazing.</text>

I'm visiting Mediterranean restaurants in the area. What I can share anout this place is:
1 Place is clean.
2 Cafeteria feel to it.
3 Nice people
4 Food Portion size too small for what you  pay.
5 I had a greek salad with kobab chicken.
6 chicken really didn't have that Mediterranean sason (seasoning)  to it.
They gave me 4small chunks of chicken and the salad was on a think dinner plate.  As if I order half a salad.  Portion size was equivalent to small saled in other restuarants.
6 Would i come back? Yes I would just to try other thing on the menu.<//review>

<rating>5</rating><text>This is a simple Mediterranean (Chaldean) style restaurant. This is family owned and operated, so the mother or son may take your order and serve your food while dad makes the food in the back. They do have a few employees, so that's not always the case.

The food is homemade style. The lentil soup is wonderful. Chicken tikka is very tasty. And the filet mignon is off the charts. The salmon plate is also done just right. I do wish the pita bread was fresh baked. They do heat it up a bit, but if they had a tandoori or brick oven for that, this place would be amazing.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<review>Had shawarma in pita bread- amazing! So flavorful, and soft. Wasn’t greasy and had just the right amount of fresh salad mix and tzatziki. Also had some baklava- oh gosh so sweet(the honey kind so you don’t feel guilty) . First time going and mannn I loved it. Not to mention it’s so clean and inviting inside. The cashier was very patient with my wandering daughter.  Loved the experience! Must try!<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>After having gone yesterday for my birthday lunch, the fam and I will definitely be repeat annihilators!!! Being a fan of Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food, I felt the need to give this newly-discovered resto a chance among those that I've given my promiscuous food palette a chance on such as Sahara, Valley Foods, Al Azayem, and North Park Produce.

While the restaurant's location isn't the most appealing (not to their own fault), I thought the owner's made up for it with their interior decor. If it had to be described, I'd say that it was neat, clean, and not too lavish or exotic in theme (which I'd say is a positive).

Their food menu was wall set near the register arranged in side-by-side framery of fairly high-quality, professional appearing culinary photos. The impression I got was that it was an order your food first then sit down type setting...and that we did!

My fam of five opted to go with the meal for three plate that fed our salivating mouths presented on a large silver platter filled with yellow rice (which layered the flat contour of the platter), two beef kebabs, two chicken kebabs, cuts of beef and chicken shawarma, and lastly an extra crispy, golden-brown chicken patty that identically resembled what the Japanese would call chicken katsu.

Now, let me tell you this- I am in no way exaggerating that I have a huge appetite and that portion-size is just as important to me as taste is to practically everyone on this planet aside from a contestant on I guess Naked and Afraid? (shrug). And boy did this place meet the challenge of my stomach's elasticity!!! I'd say it beat it, actually, because we had enough to take home and me to stuff myself with as a midnight snack!

And when we speak of the flavor/taste of the food? Ughhhhhmayzing (amazing)! Each meat item I fed my mouth with was bursting with flavor, no lie! I swear I could taste every fine spice that each food variety in the plate included. I could tell that behind the kitchen door was a cook who poured their love and joy of cooking into the meal that we had that afternoon. And their hummus and baba ganouge that was also served to us was phenomenal as we scooped each kind into neatly cut, fresh and warm from the oven pita bread.

As mentioned earlier, we're definitely coming back as this easily rivals the best I've ever had so far when it comes to Middle-Eastern cuisine (Sahara is my current top choice although I have many restaurants left to try).

Soooo....if you're in the mood for delicious, mouthwatering foodfare, you definitely have to hit this place up if you so happen to get lost in the Casa de Oro neighborhood of the Spring Valley area!

Make sure to give that thumbs up as if you were stranded in the Mojave Desert if you'd like more reviews! :)< /Text><gmapID>0x80d95a06768a3f1f:0x22a6cb9b79ccfa20<//gmapID><rate>5< /rate>< time>

<review>Had my first experience on 10/21/17. Went in and placed my order to go. Dining room is, nice sized, clean, well lit, and has food in refrigerated display. It was making my mouth water as I waited for my order. I ordered the filet mignon plate. With tax it is $14. Cashier was courteous. Took less than 10 min. Thanked me for coming in. My initial thought was its pricey. Food serving was perfect. They didn't skimp on the filet mignon either. Rice was delicious. The Mediterranean salad was small but blasting flavor and realized I didn't need more of it. Hummus was fresh & creamy. My dinner was worth the value. I will definitely be going back soon. Thanks for the good experience.<//review>< Pics>

I was skeptical about the place at first due to it being located in Casa de Caca. Boy was I surprised when I got there. The previous reviews were dead on. Clean and nicely decorated. The kid behind the counter was a pleasant and courteous lad. Food was great. I will definitely go back.👍👍<//text>

This place is awful, No Gyro. The meat they put in my sandwich tasted old and bad. I instantly bit into the pita ate a few pieces of meat and almost threw up. Meat even smelled off.<//Review>

I had a great experience renting space at Public Storage Arrow Hwy branch.  Christina couldn’t have been nicer and extremely helpful.  I can’t thank her enough.  It made my move a lot easier and less stressful.</review>

<Review>I spent many hours researching the best place to store my belongings and this public storage location was the one that had the most consistently high results. I kept my belongings here for half a year and had a perfect experience. Christina who works here in the office was so wonderful and helpful every time I needed to access my storage unit. The units were impeccably clean and well maintained—cleaner than most people’s apartments! Access hours are generous and the entire process of storing my belongings through closing out the unit was a piece of cake. And the area is super safe. I am so glad I chose this location. Thank you Christina for keeping my belongings safe and secure!!< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c335e88adf0093:0x57be19bbfc53dcd9</Gmap_id>< userid>

<Review>BEWARE!!!!! ROBBERY-!!!!!!! DO NOT COME HERE###### NOT SAFE&&&&&&&THEFT!!!!!!!!!

My unit was just broken into within the past week ( unit was only rented for a total of 23 days).  As a previous comment mentioned, lock was fully intact and still usable as the thief's locked the unit when they left.

More than half the unit was stolen and the rest was ransacked, I am absolutely devastated.

Police arrived and completed a report and due to value will have detectives investigate.

However, the staff comments or the lack of interest in the whole situation was disturbing.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Christina and Sharon make an amazing team. They are highly efficient, and  are always pleasant, respectful and kind. The facility is immaculately clean and in excellent repair. It is also safe and very secure. I actually felt sad when I closed my account. I felt as if I was saying goodbye to good friends. I highly recommend this particular Public Storage site.< /text>

<text>I actually called the Ontario location first, but they did not have any large units available. However, the Rep was kind enough to check the Rancho location for me. He held the space for me, and I ran right over!  Sharon was AMAZING!  She was very helpful, and the units are clean!   I highly recommend you check them out if you need to store some things.<//text>< name>

<text>Christina provided amazing service! She took the time to show me all my options and help suggest what will work for the about I had to store! Very competitive pricing with the storage in the area but I do feel extra secure within all the procedures they have in place! I’m very satisfied! 😁< /text>< Pictures>

<Review>What a personable professional team...Christina&Sharron!!  They take our needs to heart.  They make us feel safe&special whenever we pop in.  They even called with a followup from a comment I made a year ago to let us know when a larger storage unit was available (5 feet) next door to the unit we wanted to move from.< /Review>< Pics>

I spent about a week searching for the perfect storage unit and kept coming back to this Public Storage. I finally reserved a unit and went down there. The price for the size I needed was by far better than all the other storage facilities in the area. Sharon greeted me at the front desk and gave me a tour. The place is immaculate. Not one piece of trash or even a leaf could be found on the ground. She explained everything up front to the point where I had no questions once she was done. She was awesome!  I went around 9:30 and was moving my items in about 20 minutes later.  She made the process quick and easy. If you need a storage unit stop searching. This is the place!  And if you’re lucky you’ll get Sharon to help you out as well.<//Review>

See update below for move out review:

Sharon was the reason we rented here - great experience, clean facility, and Sharon was super helpful.  She ended up staying a little late since we were pressed for time and that was really considerate and helpful because we were on a time crunch with moving.  Knowledgeable about the property, all the amenities, how it works, and reasonable rates for what we got (climate controlled, etc.).

UPDATE - Christina helped us move out by CALLING about a bedframe item that we left in the unit by accident....what a LIFESAVER!  This facility is really managed and operated by am awesome team - thank y'all!

Thanks guys!<//text>

<Review>Christina and the staff at this location are an example of excellent customer service.  Everyone is always friendly and helpful.  I set up my account & reservation online & was immediately contacted by Christina to set up an appointment.  She is very professional, kind, and informative. The entire rental process was quick and easy.  The location is always clean & well lit if you enter at night too.  Christina & staff take pride in their work & it shows in the great customer service they consistently provide.  I highly recommend this Public Storage facility!</Review>< pics>

I moved from Northern California and left my belongings in a public store storage unit there, but had I known that the Arrow route facility was so big, clean and staffed with great employees like Sharon and Christina who always provide excellent customer service, I would have stored items in this facility.</review>< Pics>

Christina was extremely helpful and a joy to deal with. The total experience was quick & easy from beginning to end. She offered many suggestions to storage solutions which enabled me to make sound decisions for my short term needs. The facility was extremely clean to include the unit I signed up to rent.
I'd recommend this facility to anyone needing short or long term storage. 👍</text>

Chastina was very professional through the entire process.  She led me through the facility to my unit highlighting the entry and exit points, how to find my way around once inside, how to operate gates, elevators, etc. Great person representing Public Storage.< /Text>

Needed boxes. To ship Christmas gifts out of state. For the holiday ,with the assistant provided by the employee of the month of December. In my opinion Christina your employer at 10701 Arrow Route, Rancho Cucamonga, CA  deserves to be that recognized employee. For she went above her mean in supporting her customer Rosie Knighten. She took  a medium size box. Altered by cutting all four sizes. Giving me the opportunity to pay for lesser height. Once I go to Post Office for shipping a gift to the Midwest. I paid $ 45.00 today  For Shipping instead of $100.00 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Thank you so much Christina for benign thoughtful  enough to make a difference in my time of need. All of these special star ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Are for you. HAPPY HOLIDAYS TO YOU AND YOUR LOVE ONES. YOU SURLY ASSISTANTS ME IN A VERY HUMBLE WAY. MERRY CHRISTMAS & HAPPY NEW YEAR IN 2020  CHRISTINA❤️</Text>< Rating>

<Text>Cristina was working on Mother's Day, thank goodness. Checked on us and our door was a mess. Lickety split, she came by with the tools to fix it for us. She has helped us many a time in the past.

This public storage facility is extremely clean and well taken care of. I highly recommend their facilities if you are looking for a safe place to store some extra stuff.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c335e88adf0093:0x57be19bbfc53dcd9< /Gmap_id>< Name>

We highly recommend this very clean and well organized storage facility. The prices are very fair and more economical compared to PODS & other centers we shopped. This center is operated &  managed by Christina, who provided very personalized & excellent customer service to us. She took us on a tour showing us several options in addition to answering all our questions and making suggestions to help satisfy our storage needs.  Once we decided on a unit to rent she thoroughly explained each and every facet of the rental process to us.  The other staff members were also very personable and helpful to us just like their manager, Christina.</review>

Renting at this location has been amazing. Christina and Ashley are very knowledgeable about storage and packing.   Both of these girls have great customer service skills and are very friendly. These are the type of people that make you want to come back and work with for your storage needs. On a scale from one to ten, I give them 100. Thanks for all your help.  God bless this company.</Review>

<text>The staff agent Cynthia was incredible! The best part was the on-line easy of reserving the unit and then the call from Cynthia within  30 minutes to set up the appointment. Cynthia helped us with setting up our new storage unit doing both the walk through and paperwork all within a hours time. She was great! Cynthia answered all our questions and made us feel like our things in storage will be safe. Was able to moving in things the same day.

Thank you again Cynthia!!!<//text>< response>

<Review>Excellent facility :) I reserved my storage online and received a call from Ashley about 15 minutes after asking what would be a good time for us to come in... I reserved it @ 11am and was moved in by 2pm.  By far the best rates in town!  A storage facility literally the next block over was asking double for the same size unit with no climate control.  Both Ashley and the property manager Christina were very sweet and helpful.  My unit was well lit and extremely convenient to the elevator... I highly recommend this facility!  The 24 hour surveillance cameras give me great piece of mind as well... Keep up the great work :)</Review>< Response>

Just finished renting a unit from Laurie and Christina, the queens of storage in Rancho.  After looking around a bit and getting more and more confused, I found PS and realized this was the cleanest, best run and maintained storage facility around. A good value as well. The staff was very helpful and answered every question quickly and completely, not programmed responses. I feel like my property is safe, secure and in good hands. I highly recommend this place.<//review>

Cynthia greeted us warmly upon entering and with Laurie answered all of my wife's concerns about long term storage.  Cynthia showed us a couple of units she said my fit our needs. We selected one and did the paperwork, which took all of 10 minutes.  Overall experience positive thanks to the efforts of Cynthia and Laurie</review>< Pictures>

The woman I spoke with on the phone was super helpful she confirmed where and when I am able to check into my storage unit. I hung up the phone and the location where my unit would be called right away to confirm my appointment. Christina and Alisa were super friendly and professional! I haven't moved into my unit yet but I'm very pleased with my service so far!!<//Review>

<Text>My sisters, our Dad and I came in to get a storage unit to help my sister move. This was our first time getting a storage unit. The young lady working inside at the desk that helped us was Lily and she was super nice, super helpful and she had such a great cheery attitude she deserves an A+
This public storage is nice clean and the units are air conditioned so that was awesome!! ☺️</Text>< pics>

Public Storage in Rancho is the best storage facility around.  I got my first storage unit at this location last year and I had a very positive experience.  Christina was cheery and very helpful, the facility is always clean and well cared for, and the units are easily accessible.

I am very happy to recommend Public Storage to my friends and family because they have been great!  Go check out the facility and meet the people and you will know what I mean.

Christina and Laurie were fabulous! They were extremely helpful and professional!  Talk about excellent customer service... They go out of their way to help.  The lady in line couldn't fit their TV in her car and Laurie/Christina actually moved the TV for the lady in her own personal vehicle!<//review>

Loved my experience here! Christina was so helpful in finding a unit that was perfect for my things! She even helped me find the right kind of boxes, so I didn't over spend or pay for anything I didn't need. I'm going to enjoy renting here and I highly recommend getting a space with Christina!< /text>

By far the cleanest storage facility I have visited.  I went to three and chose this one because of the hours and security.  Sharon and Christina were awesome. In the area of Customer service, they exceeded my expectations.< /Review>

I would just like to share that this location has amazing helpful employees.  Sharon and Christina helped me out yesterday 1/9/18 when I went in looking for a unit.  They answered all my questions and were both very patient with me. :-)  Thank you for having great staff @ this location who knows what they are talking about.<//Text>

From day 1 when I was looking around for a storage facility, I knew this was the place when I walked through the door.  Professional, friendly, polite and very helpful.  Christina, Laurie and Leslie (trainee) are "OUTSTANDING."  Christina went beyond her scope to make sure I was prepared with materials needed to make my move easy... which it was both times.  Both Laurie and Christina are very honest and upfront, plus the facility is very clean, and the cost of the units are very good, which is very important . I had a complex move and with their recommendations, everything was perfect!!!  I recommend "Very Highly" this Rancho Cucamonga storage facility to anyone who never rented a storage unit and like myself, has had other storage units... this one is the Best and that is due to the personal Public Storage has running this facility... Christina and Laurie.< /Review>< pics>

<Text>I reserved a unit online quick and easy. When I arrived to the facility it was 30 min before closing time and apparently everyone decided to show up at that time. lol Laurie  assisted me, she was awesome! She gave me the best customer service while also attending others graciously. The grounds and unit was clean and good price.

<review>Today was my first experience with renting a storage unit. All the staff at this facility was extremely professional and answered any questions I had extremely well. Ashlyn Wells was the associate to show me my storage unit and run me through all the paperwork and processing and set me up with exactly what I wanted. She did a wonderful job as a trainee and I'm sure she will continue to do a great job with all other customers. This is a great facility run by highly qualified and friendly employees.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Edit: I had a lot of issues with the facility, not the people. For several weeks they were only open during business hours which left me unable to get to my things. Then the elevators were inoperable for several weeks. One night I showed up and the gate was stuck wide open. When I moved out the elevator was acting oddly and and slow, but I luckily never got stuck on it.
Employees are still nice though.<//Review><pics>None</pics><gmap_id>0x80c335e88adf0093:0x57be19bbfc53dcd9< /gmap_id>< userid>

Love this location. Christina & Laurie went above the call of duty. Friendly and amazing customer services. They gave us a tour helped us find a storage unit that fit our needs. When I lost our key code access I called in a panic and they had already assisted my husband and mother. Storage units are very clean and accessible. I will recommend them to anyone in need.</review>

Christina and Sharon were absolutely wonderful.  They helped us navigate through a cross-country move and were able to assist us through the entire process.  I've been in the customer service business my entire life, and these folks are the best in the business.  I would not hesitate referring anyone to Public Storage in Rancho Cucamonga.< /Text>

I give much love to the team at Rancho Cucamonga Public Storage. I told them what I needed, they gave me the best options available. I changed my mind a few times, but they STILL had a good attitude and helped me 'work it out'.  Thanks Team RC Public Storage - Laurie, Erica and Christina! You're THE BEST!< /Text>

I made a reservation with Heidi at the Public Storage in Rancho off of Hermosa and unfortunately we couldn't find what I was in need of. So, she went way beyond what I expected to accommodate me and found exactly what I wanted at the Public Storage in Rancho Cucamonga off of Arrow Rte. She told me to ask for Sharon. My appt was set for 11:30 am (10/02). I drove over to the location & met with Sharon. I have to say she was so kind as well as patient & very understanding. Sharon made me feel welcomed & never once rushed me through the process. I'm happy that i chose this location as well as this company. THANK YOU SHARON & HEIDI< /text>

<text>On Dec 4, 2015 I contacted Public Storage & I spoke with LAUREN regarding moving into a bigger storage & on Dec 5, 2015 I was able to get everything taken care of with ease.. I want to give SPECIAL THANKS TO LAUREN in Rancho Cucamonga on Arrow Hwy. I had to move into a bigger storage & she was so very helpful & I'm so happy I went to this location a little over a year ago.. I honestly think LAUREN should get a raise. :)   She went out of her way & she allowed me to move into my new storage with ease & I have to admit it was a GREAT GREAT Day..  I THANK YOU LAUREN FOR ALL YOUR HELP.... KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK. YOU ARE SO AWESOME :) :) :) :)< /text>< pics>

<Time>1433869117167<//Time><review>I currently use a unit at Public storage for my job - to store seasonal supplies as needed. I have been renting my unit from them since June 2013 and the prices are low and reasonable for a nice, clean unit. Every time I visit the office Christina and Martika are extremely helpful and accommodating. If you live in the Rancho area I would highly recommend using this location as their customer service is excellent!< /review></record>

Cristina and April were so helpful.... It was a long day of moving and I really needed someone to come through for me and they did. They took time to show me what all of the different sized storages looked like and helped me find one in a good location for backing up a truck. Perfect Public Storage just perfect!!!< /Text>

<Review>It's a storage facility. Not really sure what there is to say. It's clean and climate controlled which is nice. But I hate paying $144/mo for a 10x10 unit. That's the reason it's 3 stars, but it's s completive price. Such a rip.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Christina and her staff have always been kind and ! I've been at Public Storage at this location for over 3 years and the only reason I'm leaving is because I have a new home and don't need a storage area. I don't want people think I'm leaving to go to a competitor's place. So if you ever need storage,  go to Public Storage on Arrow Highway in Rancho Cucamonga because you won't be disappointed!< /Text>

A very comfortable atmosphere to store items, the staff (Laurie & Christina) are extra helpful in the processing and even giving a helping hand. I will recommend public-storage to family, friends and associates, thank you for a very peaceful experience!!</text>

Sharon is great! I came to see a 10x10 unit, the place is very nice and Sharon is very professional, i'm going to talk it over with my brother but i'm certain we will end up getting it, I came away from there very impressed with how courteous and professional she is as well as how clean the property is. Thanks again Public Storage!</Text>

We were told by staff employee Sharon that both carts were taken, and it was first come, first serve, so we would have to wait.

<Review>Sitting outside the door waiting for them to return my driver's license. If they had told me I might be stuck with a 30 minute wait to get it back, I wouldn't have left it. Storage unit is empty... Just need to return a key and get my license.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c335e88adf0093:0x57be19bbfc53dcd9< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Took my 21’ Ram Rebel in to get a liner and the service was excellent. Told the guys that I wouldn’t be able to pick the truck up until after they closed and the owner said he would not mind waiting around until 5:30pm for me. Since I stated I would be a little later, they just locked my keys in the truck and parked it in front of the owners house, in his driveway right next to his own truck! Most places would lock it up in the yard and tell you pick it up on their time (and yes they made sure I had a spare first) I will definitely be returning to ultra truck for any of my accessories. Great company!!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I’ve been doing business with this company since 2004. They are professional, courteous and very helpful in finding the right part. They have better prices than ordering it online and if they don’t have it they usually get it the next day (better than waiting for delivery or paying a monthly membership fee).</Review>

When they forget to do a part of an install, they treated is as if we were a new walk in. Our truck was there for 2 1/2 days. We came and pointed out the harness was missing...they promised to get to it first thing the next morning, NOT.  Told us they had other trucks lined up and wanted us to come back next week?  We get there and it was installed. They need better communication between shopsmen and front counter staff.< /review>

Just bought tire chains. The manager researched the best product for my 4Runner. Joe, the manager, really knows his stuff! Great service. . . I'm 100% sure we'll be back.</Review>

Hey went there to buy a lock for the cover on the back of my pickup truck. They didn't have it so they told me they would order for me. That's been a year-and-a-half ago and I'm still waiting for the phone call. LOL that's one special lock.<//text>

< Review>
The worst shop I have ever been to. Had a bed liner sprayed in found over spray all over the truck. Was told it was road grim (NOT)    spray liner lifting up after 3 weeks and they GLUE it back down. The rubber stops for the tail gate was not put back in correct and then they said it was never there but when I pulled the rubber stop out from inside the cab they had another excuse. The pin was bad after they removed it and I was told to go buy one.  They are not friendly don"t care about the customer and have a MAJOR ATTITUDE. I would not recommend them to anyone or take even a roller skate in to them for any repair. BAD PLACE STAY AWAY</Review>

Dined in and it was a hit and a miss. The pho dac biet was decent but that bbq beef was just way too sweet. The pho was about $13 and it tasted fresher than the one from Pho Vy. The bbq beef was about $12 and it was a lunch special that included a questionable-looking salad and soup (it had one tasty wonton). The rice noodles (with the bbq beef) was very dry so I dipped it into the free soup. Would come back for their pho but probably not going to be adventurous.</text>

Family owned and interesting food. I love v8 because it gives you a little of everything. I also like the spring rolls. V8 is enough for two unless you are a big eater.< /Review>

< Review>
This is our absolute favorite place to get pho. We have been to many places in Southern California (San Diego, Oceanside, LA, and Riverside), and even some locations in Las Vegas and Phoenix area, and nothing beats the flavor of the pho broth at Saigon in Bakersfield!! The bahn mi sandwiches are delicious too, as is the chicken curry (add mixed vegetables, it's worth the extra price, is delicious, and makes it enough food for two people!). The owners and staff are beyond friendly and amazing people, and the interior decor of the restaurant is adorable! I love this place and highly recommend it!! We come here several times a month during regular operations, and never regret it.

I read a few of the bad reviews here on Google, and I am very skeptical about their validity; one bad review is clearly for the wrong restaurant, as Saigon is definitely not a buffet. I will say I almost never leave reviews, but this restaurant is one of my favorite restaurants in Bakersfield and I suggest you give it a try!</Review>

Not the best buffet but good for the value and variety. We came here for dinner with a pretty large group. The staff was friendly and accommodating.

A few of my favorite items from here was the prime rib, their pizza was pretty good. Carving station also had turkey that was moist and delicious too. But the prime rib was the best. Their gelato was really good too, the coconut one was my favorite. And my other favorite dessert was the cream puffs.</Text>

< Review>
This afternoon I've ordered a Special beef noodle soup,  $ 6.99 and a beef with broccoli dinner,  10.99 according to web site info. When I went to pick up my order I was asked to pay over  $ 46.00 and was informed to my surprise that one of the item I've ordered
two servings which I had no knowledge about. After corrections I left with paying almost $ 32.
Above all this the liquid for the soup/ never in its life saw any beef, I was supplied with a pound of rice and another pound of alfalfa of which upon tasting it gave me gag reflex almost throwing it up, beeing of eastern European decent it is behind my understanding how can people consider this horse food as compatible for human consumption.  Anyway, the tiny cup consisting of little beef and vegetable was kind of tasty but the paper thin pink looking beef did not remind me of anything tasting like beef. The noodles were of artificial looking, like made from plastic and devoid of any taste other than plain tastless water, so In my frustration I throw the big mound of rice into the microwave with a bunch of grated cheese on top of it so I can supply my body with some calory rich food after a hard day's work.
Of course I don't have to tell you that also that pound of horse food went right into the trash can since there are no horses around here.
One thing is for sure that it is highly unlikely that I ever again visit this place in the future.< /Review>

Service was nice, food was good, also close to the freeway, but overpriced for Bakersfield. I'm from the bay area and there are many Vietnamese restaurants that are better charging less then they do here.

Family got phố đặc biệt and phố tại chín. I got bún đặc biệt.< /text>

Thai tea and Vietnamese coffee were delicious. Dumplings, soup, and spicy beef were flavorful. Everything was done just right. At the end they provided complimentary tapioca, which was unlike any tapioca I’ve ever had. Staff were friendly and welcoming.<//review>

<review>This adds a bit of time away from Highway 5, but the reviews are decent and they have air conditioning. An open space, haphazardly decorated with bits of love and attention here and there. Large menu with some more exotic and fun choices, for example, the ice cream in a coconut shell and banana leaf steamed sticky rice and mango slices. The pho broth may have too much msg. Bahn mi sandwich had a nice French baguette bread. Spring rolls were lacking in flavor and ingredients. A small, friendly mother waitress with exuberant energy was happy to serve everybody.</review><Rating>3< /Rating><username>M.A. EatsArt<//username><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfhKdPLehG1B1HQqR_zEm7Oetm7hsjHoJREj7B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< userid>

<Text>3 start for food -aerage taste; and 2 start for service. Broth a bit too sweet. If you love pho, it has limited options (maybe 3 or 4 types) they do have more entree dishes than average Vietnamese place but we didn't try any. Beef texture is hard.

Service-wise, we ordered multiple noodle soups to go and asked for a few small bowls so we can serve kids. and they charged us 25 cents a bowl. Am not completely happy, but after 10hr drive, I just want a pleasure meal. We have asked for to-go foods all the time and no one charged extra for this. Again, it's fine they do, but i do expect that as a service from the owner. I always tipped restaurant owners who are helpful and I can't say that in this case. Again, I hope it's incidental. Happy holidays then ...<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

Bad quality. Very unprofessional staff. Restaurant looked too old and dark, No other customer  was in the restaurant and I asked staff if I can change my table and sit on kind of lighter area, she said no!  Super dirty cups with broken parts.. broken spoon..portion of the regular size was very small, over priced.. weird color and the taste especially the taste of beef was so strange, low quality noodles. The root and basil that come on the side looked too old. My first and last time trying this place. Have no idea why  some people gave it good reviews.</Text>

<Text>The food was really good.  I'm giving it 3 stars because 2 bowls of pho, 2 drinks and spring rolls costed 48 dollars way overpriced for Bakersfield . 4 dollars for a regular soda!!! I usually go to New Saigon on Union.  I would have paid half the price for similar food and quality.< /Text><Response>None<//Response><Name>M M< /Name>< userid>

The beef noodle soup was delicious and there was plenty to meet my desire.  The banana sticky rice with mangos left much to be desired.  The chef was definitely on vacation when this over priced recipe was created.  The banana rice was salty or possibly a combination of salt and msg.  The white sauce was a white tasteless glob.  The ripe mangos were perfectly ripe and sweet.  I tried two dishes and one was good therefore  the stars end up the same,  in the middle</review>

I love this place! It's the original Vietnamese restaurant here in Bakersfield. They have been consistently delicious since the day they opened. But my go to dish in the winter is their chicken pho and summer is the bbq beef bahn mi. Make sure you also try the shrimp and pork spring rolls with peanut sauce! So good!</Text>

<Gmap_id>0x80ea6a0250ca75eb:0xad786950c9ed86cb< /Gmap_id><Text>This is the best Pho in Bakersfield, and it isn't even close. The spring rolls are so soft, that they remind you of Dim Sum shrimp dumplings. The broth in the Pho Tai is beautifully seasoned. You get cilantro AND Basil and instead of lime, they give you some sort of orange/lemon/lime hybrid. The whole thing is fantastic.</Text><user>115115652921685205939<//user>< resp>

Big disappointment.  Expecting more from a 4.5* location.
-The Bánh xèo (Vietnamese savory crepe) was good 5 stars
-The bò kho (Vietnamese beef stew) was terrible,  so not made correctly 1 star
-The Bánh Mì Dặc Biệt (Literal translation is Bread Special, this is Vietnamese sub with various meats) The pork used was oh so wrong, should be head cheese. There was no butter and it had tomatoes.  I mean I like tomatoes but it doesn't belong. 1 star<//Review>

Portions are small. Price is on the high side. Food tasted mediocre. Tradional, but mediocre!  Service was okay. They had an older lady serving and attending the whole place. 🤔 (NOT cool!) Did not look very clean... I will definitely not be returning!< /review>

It's been my favorite for over 15 years. I get the same veggie tofu bok choy pho, veggie eggrolls, and veggie chowmein. Perfect every time. I've had a few beef and chicken plates as well. They were rather delicious.< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>First time visit 5-23.  I look for chicken pho...it's kind of my Vietnamese passion and the pho (N2 on the menu) was probably some of the best I have had.  Also ordered pork and shrimp egg rolls which were also good but the pho is the reason for the 5 stars.

Service was fast and friendly by multiple employees.

I will go back.  Probably a lot.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Cheap ingredients (noodles were poor in quality as soon as u picked up the noodles they were breaking). Dirty silverware, sticky tables, dirty cups with lip stick stains YUCK!!! Most importantly poor customer service. Don't eat here because I would never do it again... Try Pho 88 or Maui pho if you want good quality pho.</Text>

<review>My one and only spot I got to for Pho in Bakersfield. Surprisingly we have plenty of other places to go to here but I would rather come to Saigon. I feel like it's more authentic, like how we would make it at home. But what makes me like this place more than the others is that they have alot of other Vietnamese dishes other than spring rolls, there's more to Vietnamese food other than Pho. Try the vermicelli with charbroiled bbq pork, shrimp and fried eggrolls..its fresh but still warm and it's not super heavy either..BOMB<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

(Translated by Google) Although it is a Vietnamese restaurant
The taste is not very authentic
Really a delicious Asian restaurant
There are also big sisters who can speak Chinese.
Feel very kind, very relaxed

(Original)
雖然是越南餐廳
口味不是很道地
確實是一家很好吃的亞洲餐廳
裡面還有會講中文的大姐
覺得很親切 很放鬆< /Text>

It's one of the few places to hike in Moreno valley but it's definitely the best IMO. Nice challenging hike if starting from the regional parking by hidden springs.  Most gyms are closed so come here for a good workout.</review>

This place is easy to get to and doesn't have crowds.  The hikes range from easy to HARD.  No shade so be sure to hydrate and avoid overheating.  Snakes are around so keep your eyes open.  Also, make sure you get your car out - the gate does close early.< /Review>

<Text>Amazing trail to follow up this Mountain! Great with friends or anyone you wanna be with! The trail sprouts in different directions but all lead to the top! If you live in Moval and haven't been up there yet, you're seriously missing out.< /Text></record>

<date>1524577495628<//date><rating>5</rating><Text>I just did  this hike on 4-21-18  Saturday and the Park is open at 7:AM so its best to start the Hike as soon as you can. On a slow and steady pace you can complete this hike between 2-3 hours. Also I recommend have good hiking shoes or some footwear that has good traction. Overall Great hike!</Text>< pics>

Clean cuts and professionalism at it's finest! Owner and his son give cuts there. And the barber that cut my hair Hop has his son there doing cuts as well. The owner is respectful, gives back to the community w/ charities and free summer bbq events. Can't say enough about the owner and the place. You wouldn't know it bc of the area, but like I stated earlier. The barbershop still has swag and keeps it professional great place to bring your kids. When there's children present he doesn't allow cursing, sagging etc in there. I've been going for years and those are big reasons why.<//Text>

I didn’t get the barbers name but he was first chair in the left.. After he was done getting his cut the barber got him a gum ball from the gum ball machine that my son kept pointing to & saying he wanted to go see it.. this place is professional, friendly & made us feel welcome. Thank you! You guys just got a loyal client! Definitely will be back!<//Review>< Pics>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Man I havn't let anybody cut my hair since I moved to Sacramento 14 years ago. If i can't get an appointment with Tori or Hop, I'm not getting cut . And I definitely won't go to another shop. It's more than just a hair cut at fly cuts it's the positive  atmosphere and the nostalgic feeling you get like stepping back to a better time. If any thing they are more than just barbers they are the nucleus of the community holding it all together, welcoming every race and people from all different walks of life. This isn't a review you can pay for this is straight from the heart. If you want a fade or a line up for your braids.... go to FLY CUTS</Review>< pics>

<Review>I give this place 5 out of 5. The owner of this establishment is my barber and I have been going to him for years, 8 to be exact. I watched his business go from a two man shop to having 6 barbers besides himself. I have never experienced any bad customer service, the staff are very professional, and the customers are pretty chill as well. This was not the only barber I have tried in Sacramento, but best believe I will not be going anywhere else.<//Review>< Time>

<Text>Fly cuts and styles is the only barbershop I go to when in town visiting my parents. I've been getting cuts from these since I was in high school and have followed them from location to location. My go to barber is Hop,  who has been cutting hair for my family for ages. However, all the barbers are highly skilled and experienced. No matter if it's slick and professional to something special and over the top these guys can handle it.  The only thing I recommend is that you call in advance to shorten your potential wait time. Sometimes it can get packed!</Text><Gmap_id>0x809ac571c4a2a16f:0xfa0a8b61027485a0<//Gmap_id><rating>5< /rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures><name>Mohammad Rashid<//name>< resp>

I had to click on one star coz I had no other option. I went in at 11 am this morning with my sons that needed haircuts. We were ignored. We waited for a few moments to see if anyone was going to help us but no one bothered to so we left. Came across this place on the internet and liked what we saw so we drove all the way here or of our way. Idk if we were ignored coz we r Asians but we will never return here again.< /Review>

I’ve been coming to Magnuson since 2007.. I have had tint installed on two Camry’s , Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Chrysler 300..., And today I’m installing an upgraded sound system on my 2019 Toyota Tacoma... never had a problem. My family and I don’t go anywhere else.<//review>

<text>This place is not worth your time or money. I got my windows done a little over a month ago and now there is little air pockets popping up. I have the warranty so i called to see what i can do and this grown man answers. I tell him about the air pockets and before i can finish my sentence he cuts me off and decides he wants to get loud telling me i need my receipt. Uh ok sir i have my receipt but after your tantrum i will be taking my business to an actual professional. They couldn't get it right the first time so why should i bother the second time especially when dealing with such rude shady people.<//text>< response>

This place has great deals, and the staff are nice, the tint came out perfectly they did tell me not to roll down my windows for 2 days which is fine for me, I also know that you should not take it to a car wash until after 24hrs, all in all great service I recommend this place to all. Happy Holidays Everyone 🎉<//Text>

<review>These dudes right here know their stuff about cars for sure. They have the best deals for tint, audio, glass, and custom work hands down. I was there while they were customizing a sound system on a Chevy lowrider & I was very impressed with their work and style. specially on how they worked to please that customer. Just great vibes when you meet the owner and it's staff. Lancelot is the man if you want to get a great deal and guaranteed work on your vehicle. I highly recommend this place.</review>< pics>

<review>Just had my car's rear windows tinted dark by Magnuson Window Tinting. They did an excellent window tinting job. Now I am going to get more work done to the car, vinyl wrap of the roof.  They are always busy with all kinds of different cars and clientele, a very good sign. They also take great pride in their work. Very happy I found this auto glass shop!<//review>< Pics>

Great Experience Overall!  You might not know this from their website but they will fix or replace your door window motor.  Our passenger window fell down into the door.  We called our mechanic and asked for an estimate and he quoted us a much higher price.  I called Magnuson and they gave us a much better price and the service was quick and efficient.  The passenger window now works great.</Review>

This company doesn't stand by their word and they don't care about the customer. I spoke with the  Manager who said a few months ago if I'm not able to find my receipt that shows a had lifetime warranty to come back and he will give me a discount to redo the work for all of my front windows are peeling. After a couple months and failed to be able to find my receipt I called to schedule and to check on the price with the discount the receptionist who handled the call refuse to even acknowlege the possibility of giving me a discount and said that either they give the current coupon value and that's all that they could give which I found to be acceptable for this is because I am bringing back a vehicle that did not hold up on quality of work to get there not willing to stand by it the woman was very rude not sure she's related to the business owner but if she is not related to the business owner she really represented them horribly as an employee do not go here horrible service<//Review>

Got my windows, headlights and taillights  tinted, looked very nice, and came with warranties! I also got a subwoofer installed and better speakers , was pleased with the set up very clean, and has fuses. My speakers did blow out within the first week but they gave me no trouble replacing those with better speakers all under warranty. I loved the lifetime warranty for there suntek tints and the fact that the Audio system has a warranty is great, it is a year. Also front tinting on lights have 5 year warranty. Got the back taillights redone under warranty because rain damage. Honored my warranties with no problem. I had my suspicions but they really came through we’re i needed them too. Will update review after seeing how the new speakers are. But so far pleased with the customer service.</text>

I haven' got much done on my car for a few years but recently had to take my window tints off and took my car to Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass. These guys are awesome.  My friend was waiting for me because other places I called told me it would take 2-3 hours to take off so I assumed it would been the same here but nope! My tints were off real quick.<//review>

Don't go, really bad tinting and poor service. I had to go twice to fix what should have been done right the first time. Still not satisfied but I don't want to waste any more time there.< /text>

I had auto glass tinting 3 weeks ago. I made an appointment about a week earlier and chose the type of tint we would use. I took my car to their shop and left to have some business done. 2 hours later Mr Juarez called me to say the car is ready. Window tinting was care-free and I am happy with the end result.< /Text>

I've had a lot of experience with broken windows, I've gone to many different auto glass repair shops. After a car collision the car needed the windshield replaced. After calling insurance, they recommended me to Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass and I scheduled an appointment. They did an excellent job cleaning and did the auto glass installation all in an hour while I grabbed lunch down the street.<//review>

So I did because I didn't go to work till the afternoon he said he would call me to give me a status update and he didn't. That regardless my car would b ready before 10am. When it was time for me to go to work I stopped by and they were barely getting started on my car and that was 2:30pm .....I was so mad I even lost time of work and when my car was finally ready he had the nerve to say he don't have to give me a discount but he was anyways...well now theirs bubbles on my windows when I rolled down my windows their was glue inside my door panels that rubbed on my windows it was hard to take off.. and on top of it all they left a mess in my car Lil pieces of tint all over.

Visited this office today and they did the usual, check my height and weight. She said your weight is perfect, and I asked what was it since it’s been fluctuating, she said 210lbs, its perfect. She told me to wake up every morning look at myself in the mirror and say you’re beautiful. This was my first time visiting this primary care office but everyone there was knowledgeable and so sweet. Its always good to know you’re in good hands.< /Review>

I checked out quite a few doctors that do the immigration medical exam and to be perfectly honest I was surprised at the cost that so many were charging. At this office they were charging what seems to be a very reasonable rate. The doctor and his staff are serving the community by offering an affordable way to get your immigration medical check and vaccinations done. If I have any family members or friends that are in need of such a service this is exactly where I will direct them.<//text>

My immigration interview was delayed because of COVID which meant that my I-693 expired and I had to get another one. I was really dreading it because my first one (up in NorCal) had been such a horrible experience. But Family Medical Center was a radically different experience. I have never experienced such a pleasant physical. Staff were super friendly, great attention to detail and incredible at their job. I also called around other Civil Surgeons in the area and not only were these guys the most pleasant, they also offer the best value for money! A top notch experience!< /text>

I had a very pleasant experience getting my medical exam at Dr Asher Ram clinic. Everyone at the front desk, the nurse, and the doctor made me feel welcome. The process was fast and painless and I was able to get the documents I needed in a matter of days. Overall, Dr. Asher Ran has an excellent staff and clinic.< /text>

Very nice Dr. The only problem is that you have to wait so long even you have an appointment. So you have to be patient. They have a very good and kind with their patients. Maybe if they hire more administrative personnel they could improve their waiting times<//Text>

Sara the nurse was also great and helpful. I find the immigration process to be quite stressful and she totally picked up on it and helped me calm down and feel comfortable. I really appreciated how warm and welcoming both nurse Sara and Dr. Ram were. They made the process very smooth, efficient, and fast. I felt like the clinic was very safe covid wise, it seems like they strictly follow the cdc’s guidelines and provide lots of information on how to stay safe during the pandemic.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

This place was recommended to me by a friend who did his immigration physical here. So after shopping around this place is really the cheapest i found. $269 but i got a 10$ coupon so it was $259. But its only this price if you have all you vaccines witch i did. So the way i did it was, i went to kaiser witch is my insurance and got some blood work done to see what vaccines i already have in my system. turns out i only need the MMR and hepatitis b so got them done at kaiser and then i came here and only paid $259. they are so nice and polite and no matter how busy they are they stay professional and never looked mad or in a bad mood. i really really recommend this place.<//text>

I've been visiting this clinic since I was 11 years old. I'm 36 now, and I can tell you that the doctor and the staff are the best. Prices are just right, reasonable.< /Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I've had a goood fair share of doctors in my life. Too many to keep count at this point. I have to say that this doctor is PHENOMENAL and the best I ever had. He genuinely cares about the well-being of his patients. As long you keep blood works, x rays, or other test done he will continue to keep working with you. Ive never met a doctor who this professional and caring. You can tell hes soo experienced. Im sad that the area is not as nice but his service and care makes everything worth it. Dr. Asher Ram has helped me found serious issues that many of past doctors thought it was "just fine". He took care of it right away and never neglected it.  FYI: im not an immigrant and his service is the best out of all the doctors in Van Nuys<//Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<rate>5</rate><review>I went to get my medical yesterday and I was very nervous about getting my bloods taken as I am a little weak when it comes to needles and I can faint easily.. Dr. Asher Ram was very clear with all information given to me, The nurse was AMAZING ! She even had the Courtesy to use a baby needle to do my bloods instead of an adult needle because my veins were small.... Not one pinch of pain and it was over before I knew it.. and I did not faint.  Super supportive nurse and she made me feel very confident and secure... I got a little weak after getting the tetanus but she stayed by my side until I was 100% ready.
The best service and price in town.
I have referred all friends and family.<//review>< Pics>

<text>When I first went to this place, I was glad to have a new physician who takes initiative. However, it went all  downhill. I was experiencing aches and pains in my body, and the doctor simply pushed it aside and made it seem as if I was addicted to medication. I've tried to take substituted medications he prescribed and the result was that they were not meant to treat the pain but are simply for swelling. I know what pain I was feeling but, the diagnosis he gave was wrong . He essentially wants me to not have any medical attention and thinks it will get fine on its own. It's only gotten worse I had to go to the hospital to seek treatment the people questioned why for. I told them my doctor doesn't think it's serious. The staff is unwelcoming and always in a rush. Doctors are suppose to help their patients not ingore them. And for the nurses/staff in his office they are so very rude. The attitude that they carry is terrible , very unprofessional they act as if their the doctor . Long story short I kept telling him it was something was wrong and he told  i don't try hard enough to be healthy I weigh 110 pounds and turns out I was suffering from stomach cancer . If I could I would give no stars stay away from this place .</text><name>Blanca Lopez</name><userid>112918550460119555351< /userid><Gmap_id>0x80c29705909c6839:0xbe3faeaa8240ea56<//Gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><Rating>1<//Rating>< Pictures>

I was recommended to go here by the immigration lawyer and I didn’t hesitant for a second because compared to the other google reviews, this place took the cake. We’re currently applying for green card paper work for my wife and part of the process requires a full medical exam and vaccines. They were prompt on the appointment and having the complete documents needed. On top of affordable services , Dr. Asher is an amazing doctor because he made me and my wife laugh non stop. Sarah did the blood work for my wife and she was sweet and put a smile on our faces as well. I would give this place 10 stars if I could!!</Text>

<time>1570578237508< /time><Rate>1< /Rate><review>Despite all reviews here take my advise and stay away from this place !!! It's potentially a very well hidden way to scam already vulnerable people by fronting as a ”budget-clinic”

This just happen:

I called in because I have paper copies of medical exams I've done there and wanted to verify what certain terminology meant.
I got on the phone with a very young person who looked at their computer record / system and during that conversation its pretty evident that he doesnt know anything about medicin nor HIPAA rules and customer data security.

Basically - He starts talking about my personal records without verifying who I AM.
(At the time I dont mind because I need ro verify the information urgently.)

BUT when I ask WHY the information on their computer don't match with what I have on my copies (signed by Dr Ram)  I start to become suspicious and ask for paper copies.

What happens next is that his senior takes over the phone ( I believe her name is Virginia)
She starts by saying that she is very busy and understaffed and that she doesnt have time to answer my questions .
She also says that they already gave me paper copies. ( completely missing the point about mismatching information since i'm sitting with the copies in my hand)
And that if I call back on Thursday maybe she can give me the copies for $25. But I would have to come in due to policies.
This after her coworker had already given me private information over the phone.!!!

This whole thing seems like a way for them to keep information away from customers, should they actually want to look at their records a bit closer.

Why is this? Are they maybe hiding something , maybe the vaccines were never given but signed off anyway in order to profit as much as possible ?

So long story short:

Understaffed, unprofessional , unaccomodating and potentially SCAMMING vulnerable people.

Tip to Dr Ram and Virginia:

If you're running a for profit business, One can expect the following: Customer service or understanding for peoples situations . Professionalism , Medical knowledge , and at least a try to accomodate needs given different circumstances. Not putting blame on being understaffed , having new staff , or being busy.
Thats life of running a business if you dont know what youre doing . Your customers are paying your bills. So treat them with respect .

Maybe try hire more knowledgeble staff and update to a digital system instead of pocketing the money of people who are already in a pressed situation and you see you Will make more money anyway .

Unless you're running a legit charity.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80c29705909c6839:0xbe3faeaa8240ea56<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>I have been going to this doctor for several years, he is a very caring, kind, and good doctor.  I trust him as a doctor.  He takes his time with you and is very thorough.  However, every single time I have to go there.. Every single time, there is a woman in the office, her name is Virginia who is absolutely the rudest person ever.  There has never been a time when she has not been rude to me. NEVER.  In fact it almost seems like the nastier she is the more proud of herself she gets. She pretends she is all unicorns and rainbows when talking with the other people on staff, but soon as she gets back to the patients WHAM. Nurse ratchet, Can't imagine why a doctor would keep such a  person on staff.In fact I would give Dr. Ram five stars, but she is the reason I can only give three stars.  She repeatedly makes getting paperwork, test results, authorizations, etc. an extremely difficult experience.</Text></record></dataset><record>

First of all, I want to say that my experience with Dr. Asher Ram was excellent. I thought he was very nice, efficient and I felt comfortable. I was even able to book an appointment the same day, as I work very long hours, this was convenient for me and my schedule. I'm a savvy shopper and I do all my research before I even consider a business, glad I found Dr. Ram and his team and did I mention they have the lowest prices in town? I drove from Culver City and would highly recommend them.<//Text>

<text>Went there for immigration purposes. I have a serious needle phobia. The lady who did my bloods was the best I have ever had and I literally have had hundreds. Then Dr. Ram came to see me. He was extremely professional, thorough and fun. I am in remission from stage 4 brain cancer and his words were both understanding and encouraging. I left his office feeling really good. The offices are clean. The staff friendly and efficient. They post all over their waiting room not to park in the next door US Bank parking. I wish I had heeded their warnings, because they will tow you. The entire experience was fabulous and I would not hesitate to recommend this place to anyone.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Incredible staff. I have debilitating needle-phobia, and knew I had to have three shots and a blood test all at once. I saw the reviews about how good the nurses are here with blood work, but couldn't see how anyone would be able to get this job done without me passing out. The nurse here had both procedures done within two minutes. I have never had such a good nurse. And doctor Ram was great, very sweet. 100% recommend, especially for those who fear needles. :)<//Text></record>

<review>I took my wife to Dr. Asher for immigration purposes. We were kinda of worried, had never been through this kind of situation before, but he really made us feel very comfortable and confident about the process, explaining all the details of it. It all worked out in such an easy way, that my wife became his patient after that. Every time she needs a doctor for some reason, she goes to see him, and he is always very attentive. I have been there with her a couple of times and could see myself how professional he is, always willing to help. Besides, he's got a pretty affordable price. Dr. Asher rocks!</review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c29705909c6839:0xbe3faeaa8240ea56</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Thank you to Doctor Ram and staff for the friendly and professional treatment my son and I received when we went for our medicals for immigration purposes. My son has an abject phobia about needles and I was terrified that he would not allow the doctor to draw blood or give him his vaccinations. It took immense patience (he was there a couple of hours) but the job was done and we are overjoyed. I'm very grateful for the ease with which the examination is conducted. No fuss, no stress and you're out of there. Thanks again.</Review>

< Review>
I went there for my Immigration exam. The room was full as many people are trying to get their immigration medicals completed. I have to wait a little bit . Its affordable when compared to the other doctors.Staff was good.Dr Ram was very polite and gentle. Overall, the experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend them.</Review>

<gmapID>0x80c29705909c6839:0xbe3faeaa8240ea56< /gmapID><text>I am new to LA. I am having trouble finding a good friendly doctor with staff to match. I read the prior reviews and saw that no one had complained about the staff in some time. So i decided to call and see if they were accepting new pt and try and get an appt. the person who answered the phone was a male,  The Dr. he sounded very kind and genuinely helpful. he placed me on a brief hold after hereing what I was trying to do, and then it goes south. A older female answers the phone, in a very rushed and hurry up kinda way, and i explain and ask her the same thing. and proceeds to interrupt me and say no sorry we cant give you an appt were to busy and didnt offer another day for me. (im sorry but you are all closed the rest of the year or something?? you dont have anything next week?) then as i tell her my symptoms tells me oh thats not good young lady look you need to go to hospital. Thanks lady, i have worked in the med feild and a certified med assistant, my symptoms dont need hospital care. I tried to give the benefit to the offi e despite reviews. but i told her as she was talking over me, "the reviews of your office were right, staff is not very friendly and rude."

Doctor, if they represent your office, im very sorry, they are not compassionate, steady or understanding. instead they are in a hurry, impatient, and speak over new patients. very rude and unprofessional.< /text>< user_id>

He's the best doctor of them all. Him and his staff treat all ethnicities the same. And they make sure you leave their building satisfied. Everyone that works in the office deserves five stars.</Review>

< review>
I took Immigration Medical Exam with Dr. Asher 9 years ago. Everything was smooth, fast and the price is cheaper compare to other places. Visit them again this week for my parent's Green Card Procedure, still the best place for Medical Exam compare to other place. Only take 2 days to get the result. Staffs are friendly even though they are very busy.Thanks!< /review>

<text>It was my first visit at Family Medical Center and the experience was very good.  Dr. Asher personally attended my medical needs for my immigration requirements.  He is very friendly and shows genuine concern to the clients. The reason why I gave only 4 stars, its because when I went there, there was only 1 staff in the counter attending the phone calls and the walk-in clients which caused the delay.  But despite of  how busy she was, she really tried her best to accommodate the needs of the clients and be friendly and smiling as possible.< /text><time>1376379643469</time>< Gmap_id>

Dr. Ram offers a quick, affordable and painless immigration medical exam. The staff was very friendly, especially the kind Dr. Ram. He makes you feel comfortable and doesn't waste your time.
I took my wife and all her worries diminished by the friendliness of all the staff. Thanks Doc!< /text>

Dr. Ram and the staff were great. They were helpful and kind. My experience with them was a comfortable one even though I'm a very shy kind of guy. I recommend this clinic to everyone especially my fellow filipinos who are shy at speaking english just like me. :) Very cheap service but with the superb quality:)</Review>

My experience at family and immigration medical center with Dr A Ram was awesome! I was made to feel at home, relaxed and given the impression that all will be well, when I got to see Dr Ram I felt I was seeing a real friend more than I was seeing a doctor, good job, keep it up, thank you.< /Review>

<text>Hello, my name is Suzy and I came to this clinic for a immigration medical exam. My experience was amzing. Dr Asher Ram is the sweates doctor ive had in a while. His sense of humor is lovable and his knowledge and experience outstanding. Beside my immigration medical exam i got a full panel blood test and i got to talk to him about a few worries i had about my health and he responded all my questions and concerns with an amazing attitude and sense of care. When i came back for my results he sat down and explained each test with patience and care. The whole staff of this little clinic is so sweet and caring. They are a family caring for families for sure. Thank you. I will refer anyone here who is looking for a family doctor.<//text>< pictures>

Monica gave kind, courteous,  friendly,  great
customer service.4/20/21 However when I came to move in and I felt I got the old bait and switch. My reservation price was cheaper than when I came  to move my things in the  storage. I asked if they could honor my reservation price, and I was told no and there was nothing they could do about it. They stated I should have paid for it beforehand when I came to choose the storage unit, so I wondered why would I pay for a storage unit beforehand, until I was ready to move in which makes sense since I  was going to be moving in on Friday of the same week. Long story short, I would never do business with them again. I chose a bigger Unit, less money, and better storage.< /Text>

Safe and social distanced signing of the contract at the location.  Friendly, helpful and professional assistance by "Cynthia" (Storage Agent on-site).   Storage space was clean and has lighting when making nightly runs to unit.  I was a little disappointed that the courtesy "truck and driver" was unavailable due to the pandemic but it was not a deal-breaker esp. b/c the staff was as accommodating as they can be.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Janelle was super efficient and answered all our questions! We needed same day set up, and she was great in getting us a nice rate for a good sized space. We compared with Public Storage, StoragePro, and Extra Space - and Storage Quest won out in price for the size and cleanliness.< /review>

Great service! I checked out a few places before deciding on this.

Janelle was super helpful and informative. Best prices in east bay. Super clean and well managed by staff. Drive up service and easy access to units. Pro-tip: Web prices are the best deal.

Update: We just moved out of storage. I would DEFINITELY use StorQuest again in the future. The staff was always helpful and personable. All the units were incredibly easy to access - you can drive your car or a moving truck right to most of them. We have moved 20 footers very easily throughout the property moving things in and on our way moving out. I always felt safe at their location as well.

Leaving the unit and closing out our account was incredibly easy.<//Review>

The location is excellent, yet it's set back off of a very busy street, making it feel private and safe. There is plenty of clean, well lit parking. Janelle has always provided great customer service (without being overbearing or controlling) and attention to making sure my storage experience is better than my expectations and the competition. I like the marketing ads, website, and articles which highlight adventures and offer inspiration for change. StorQuest  Self Storage on Davis Street stands out from the rest. Cost is a little higher than others, but reasonable. No public restroom available.

<review>Yvonne is amazing. I’m a current customer and needed special assistance with my unit. Currently out of state, I needed to change my entry code and some other things dealing with my unit. Yvonne is visiting from another location and was unfamiliar with the system for changing the entry code. She was incredibly thorough, calling her boss to ensure of the process and double checking, writing notes on my account and ensuring I was happy with the entire process. Yvonne is awesome and I hope to work with her again in the future.</review>< Pics>

Didn't get much help from the guy on the phone last week so I came down to the office today. I spoke to the very nice helpfully pleasant assist manager jannelle who showed me exactly what I was looking for but I unfortunately won't be moving until the end of the month. Still this location is perfect. Thanks jannelle</review>

<Text>Came in today to rent a storage unit and was greeted by Yvonne. She was so pleasant, super professional and friendly. The storage unit is clean, large and reasonable.

One of the most  kindhearted person who surpass every level of knowledge of customer service and plenty more ....  Stor Quest at 1100 SanLeandro  I will forever recommend.   Janelle Zuno is the person I highly recommend to ask for any assistance in any help you need.   Hardworking but yet goes beyond more. Her abilities of making a smooth transition in moving our household goods to a unit was beyond expected.  I can’t thank her enough. STORQUEST you have an excellent and exceptional employee ....

<user_name>R R DAVILLA</user_name>< review>
Cynthia is the BEST at this facility & like me, been there for years !!  This would be 5 STARS for her competency, assertiveness & care of this facility alone but she doesn't make the company rules.
This company gets you comfortably in your NEW unit & 3 months after your arrival, sends out an increase of rate, (USUALLY, $30 MORE EACH MONTH)  letter regardless of ANY upgrades OR LACK THEREOF at this location.
**Then once a year, comes another rent increase !!  THIS IS INDEFINITELY !!!!
One would think OR HOPE that constant, consistent renters would be given a option at a 2 YEAR lease !!  ANYTHING HELPS !!!
So this particular renter has had to juggle the units in order to keep the rent NEAR A CONSISTENT PRICE !!   Careful about juggling though, you need to REMEMBER the $20 Admin. fee & then the 3 month rate increase needs to be taken into account before switching !!  Some units go up in PRICE WHEN occupancy is high.
This makes them AWFUL LANDLORDS WHO PRICE GOUGE !!
Cynthia keeps the indoor units VERY CLEAN & KEPT up NICELY.
I've never owned an outside unit !< /review>

First things first, I’d like to emphatically thank Janelle for her extraordinary customer service and attention to care. The process to acquire a storage was EXTREMELY more seamless than past experiences primarily because of how Janelle took care of me. The facility is clean, safe, and realiable. DONT GO ANYWHERE ELSE.</Review>

<Review>Overpriced storage facility. Not to mention the cheaper units are in an "outhouse" type area and they put rat traps and poison inside your unit. She also mentioned that they can't guarantee rats won't eat my things. Though nothing happened, professionalism and cleanliness is not the best.< /Review>< Pics>

Janelle is very helpful, she is helping my cousin get a storage even though he changed his mind about storing here in San Leandro. Hopefully Hayward has room. She assures us that the Hayward location is just as clean and the ladies there are just as nice.

Everything looked nice at first. On the third day I have a storage full of mice in my belongings. They ate through all my stuff. No matter what I buy to try and keep them out they are still their. I'm so fustrated I don't like to go to the storage. It's definitely not worth the $209 that I pay a month.<//review>

Rent has increased 3 times in one year, amounting over $100, without notice. The gate hours changed to close at 6 PM and not 9 pm, without notification or decrease in rent. I had a car full of items to put in my storage only to find the gates locked before 9 PM, after driving 2 hours. The worst of all rats got into my unit twice. I have no food in my unit, yet they burrowed in my furniture and chewed holes in boxes which caused my boxes to fall and hand blown glass to break. I can't wait to get out of here!!</Review>< Pics>

We at Pinx Catering have been using Storquest for five years.  Why have we stored with them so long?  Here are just a few reasons we use their services and recommended you do as well.  Anytime there is an issue it is resolved quickly.  Always friendly costumer service.  Unlike other storage facilities we have used, the are never gone or missing for long periods of time.  It is an impeccably clean facility.< /Text>

Needed to rent a storage room ASAP and it was almost closing time,  manager, I think her name was Cindy/Cynthia (one of those) was able to help find one affordable & quick with less than 30 mins. On top of that, my storage was right when I get thru the gates! First storage facility I've been to that was very well groomed & professional. HIGHLY recommend this place if you need a storage room quick!</Text>

<review>This store has been awesome! I came in and was welcomed with an outstanding amount of care. Cynthia helped me pick out a great unit as well as finding a great plan for what i needed. She was very patient with all the questions i asked. I recommend storquest in san leandro over public storages! Thanks to Cynthia who made my experience easy and fast!

<text>A little outdated and my unit was infested with mice that made a hole in every box just to see what was inside (and yes, I made sure there was no food in every box in the unit). Also found mice poop/pee on top of everything, even saw a few, one time when I opened the door. Only reason I am there is that it is close to my home.</text><pictures>None< /pictures><Rating>2</Rating><Resp>{'time': 1495038313028, 'text': 'I would like to apologize firsthand for your recent experience at our San Leandro location.
