What a great experience with Frank’s appliance. Carol took the appointment and Kevin their technician came out and repaired our electric stove and the price was much cheaper than I thought it would be! Thank you guys.< /Review>

I bought a used dryer and washer from Frank's appliance.From day one I had heating issues with the dryer.A tech came out and said it was a vent problem with my house,not the dryer so I get that cleaned a week goes by and then it won't heat at all.I called and spike to Mike.He said bring the dryer in and I will take care of you and I will fix it, No Charge. So I took it in they said they fixed it bit it will be $72 parts and labor.Before this I went to Coast and bought brand new the fuse and igniter.They said the igniter was broken but I had just put a new one in.When Mike called he yelled at me and was not professional at all.When I questioned him about charging me the $72 when he said He would take care of me..He got mad and said he will just take the new part out.I couldn't believe how he spoke to me after it has ben a problem since day one! I will never buy anything from them again and suggest you don't either as they do not Take Care of their customers.<//Review>

<username>Katie Meehan<//username><text>Great experience here! They gave me advice over the phone about my old fridge saying it was most likely a compressor which is $1000 fix. Said I could have them come out for the service fee if I still wanted them too. I talked to a few more people I know who agreed that Frank's was probably right. I decided to get a new fridge and went to a few places to look. Frank's had the best prices with their full warranty scratch and dent inventory. Lots of selections. They were knowledgeable and not pushy. Got a great price. The delivery guys were SO careful bringing it and were really nice. Thanks Frank's!</text><Date>1566353978027< /Date>< pictures>

Had a great experience shopping for a dishwasher there. Roy the Sales Rep was very courteous, kind, and helpful...great guy and a Vietnam Veteran to boot as we talked Army shop while going through the sales process. Bought my dishwasher and delivery was already on the way to my house as soon as I left Frank's. Just waited at home a few short minutes until delivery arrived. The installation guy (I forgot to get his name) did an excellent job in taking out my old early 90's dishwasher and installing the new Whirlpool stainless steel modern day dishwasher. The installer was kind enough to let me know I had a minor leak in my hot water valve under my sink (I just replaced today in seconds) which he didn't have to do. Installer had no problems or issues installing and was done within an hour, hour and a half. Many thanks to the installer, professional and courteous! Could not get over how quiet the dishwasher sounds when running, Roy the salesman said it was super quiet, he was right! I will DEFINITELY return there for my next replacement appliance.  Kudos to all of you!<//Text>

Just got my dryer and fridge. Could of at least wiped the dust off.  When you buy a new or used car they wash the dust off right. I'm just saying, doing that simple task would show appreciation for the buyers time and business.
And they could of took the lowes sticker off the back of the fridge.<//Text>

<Review>Had a good experience first time they came to our home and fixed refrigerator. Today when they came out to fix dryer, their prices had doubled.  They charged over a $160 to replace a $20 fuse.  Good services, prices are too high now, I am sorry to say.< /Review>< Pictures>

Answer, "No." Oven comes and they want $100 more for trim. Adding to that, there is a charge to place the trim, plus the wife was told to go buy the glue. No sales person said or ask if trim was needed. I asked specifically if items needed we're not in the bill. Again, "No!" So much for Frank's Appliances.</text>< pics>

Great experience with Frank's. The ignitor in our Maytag dryer went out. I called Frank's and they had a service tech dispatched the very next morning. They had the part in stock and were able to repair it in a single visit. The tech (Mike) was courteous and polite. I would highly recommend them for appliance service.</text>

Hopefully, you won't have a repair needing a part and if you do, hopefully you won't have to speak with one of the owners, Mike, because he doesn't handle questions well.  Questions, that customers should be able to ask, such as can I pay for up graded freight to get it here sooner?  That is a "no" because he has already ordered it.  Or, how much is the repair, and if you are not specific, you will only get a ball park price.  At this point he has hung up on you and giving him the benefit of the doubt that you were disconnected, he is honest enough to say, "yeah, I hung up on you"  The rudeness of this man, in the day in age where consumers can get things cheaper online or at a big box store is really amazing.  I would suggest he not be allowed to speak on the phone or retire or sell his portion of the business. I was a long time customer, but I would just as soon spend twice as much and buy a new appliance then deal with this business, although in fairness I spoke with Greg at Frank's Appliance, who went out of his way to be accommodating and polite.  Stay away from Mike, he is a jerk and doesn't deserve to have patrons.</review>

<review>The park has trash all over the area. There's litter at every corner you go and the vegetation that was once there died. The park isn't bad but it would be better if the area was clean and had good vegetation again.< /review><rating>2< /rating>< date>

It's in pretty sad shape. Didn't spot one single green blade of grass. Grounds were completely dry. Bathrooms were atrocious. The only positive were the children's play areas. Relatively clean, and the equipment good. Hardly anyone was using the park on a incredibly nice, sunny day. We could see why.</review>

All of the children's play apparatus that you need, and plenty of grass green green grass an area for the adults to walk around and watch their children great place to probably have a birthday party or a barbecue at the park. Very well manicured and taking care of I would recommend this part to anybody.</text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><GmapID>0x808df89f410c242d:0xc9745b34f1d0a262</GmapID></record>

<rate>5<//rate><text>Very nice park overall. The entry is off Bastanchury blvd. with plenty of parking to the right, where the North ball field is, or to the left.   The basketball courts, children’s play area, the South ball field and soccer field are on this side. In the middle are the restrooms.
The grass on the soccer as well as the ball field is very well maintained and full. Great for family time, running the dog, evening walk. There is a path that can be walked around the entire park.
It is a nice clean and relaxing place to take a minute and enjoy some outdoor greasy air and sunshine.<//text>< pics>

<review>The park is okay it needs more things other than a small playground and two baseball courts. It's nice that they have outdoor seating with tables but the park needs a facelift to add more features. But on the positive note the park is clean and it's a great little spot to get away if for 30 minutes.</review>< rate>

I have gone here for years. It's a nice place and all but this one swing is rendered completely useless because of the bank it's under. No one uses the left swing. No one CAN use the left swing. All I want is to swing next to my good friends. But my legs always hit this bank. Please for the love of everything that is holy, fix this.< /review>

Park feels secluded even when people are there. Nice place for some peace and quiet on some days. The circumference is track to run or walk. I also like to steer off into the out of service railroad tracks, there are paths with trees everywhere</Review>

Good playground, but the city isn't keeping it closed per current COVID-19 city, county, and state orders. Adding the sign gives the impression it is open.< /Text>

<Review>I was in high school when these fields where built. Now that I coach here I am really impressed how nice and kept up they are. Parking sucks no lie but there’s house tracks across the street you can park in for a few hours. It’s a clean and safe park.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Nice park. The community are very friendly the kids are awesome. My son has so much fun playing here and meets new kids all the time he loves it. Even with the softball or soccer practice it's pretty quite. Only issue is the playground needs some improvement. It's kinda old and small for the ages of 5-12 yrs old which is what the sign posts. I believe they should go straight rubber not wood chips and rubber surface.<//Review>

<username>Patricia Prim< /username><text>I have taken 4-5 y.o. granddaughter here. I'm pretty sure there is a sign for usage for much older. Don't know what that is about, as she does great on all the equipment. Everything you need: #1 RESTROOM nearby; #2 lots of choices for play, #3 benches, #4 tables for picnic. I've only gone when there is not a game being played on baseball field just behind playground, so can't say how that is.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

It needs an upgrade to the play area but in general it's a very nice park. Bathrooms are locked, which I get why but we had to leave because my daughter had to go potty. Hmm maybe 4 stars is too much.<//review>

Great family park. Been coming for years. Coached soccer here as well. Yesterday we saw two FPD officers on dirt bikes clearing the park of homeless. I’ve noticed that the park was starting to go downhill with trash and loitering. Somewhat of a safety factor as well considering our car was broken into last week.
Great job Fullerton PD management of clearing and maintaining a safe environment.</Review>

Lights for the most part off on Sundays . Heads up , unless there is a baseball and or softball game . Full court basketball [1] double rims just saying but not bad during the week people show up around 6 - 630 to play . Park has kids playground  , bathroom with changung tables . Limited on grass as far as a park goes . Parking lot in the middle with park opyion surrounding . Somewhat small but not bad , no bbqs or is that type of park . Crowd is random but good people , no down on thier luck individuals living on the premise . So safe but is located next to a main street beginning or ending of Basatnchury Road but not affecting safety while in the park . There is a water drinking fountain . No snack vending machines or food for purchase . Horse trails and currently no longer in rail way / rail road located just behind park just west as far as location or direction is concerned . Well hope this helps physical activity is always a plus . God Bless<//Text>

Don't waste your time. They'll randomly change their hours whenever they feel like it. Sign says they open the drive-thru at 5:30 a.m. The lady behind the window said that no they open at 6 a.m.< /review>

<rating>4</rating><Text>This is a very efficient McDonald's. These days everything is in the drive thru so even if there's a long line, it always moves fast and without slowdown. However  I find it silly, that with new McDonald's menus if I want a quarterpounder, I have to order quarterpounder with cheese, but hold the cheese! Silly but not this location's fault< /Text>< Pictures>

I had the spicy chicken and a regular McChicken sandwich with a small french fry all came out hot. But a little too much mayonnaise and the drive-thru was exceptionally slow.< /text>

No one answering the drive through so I walk up to the door and it is locked.  I can see them in there but they ignore the customer.  I thought it was law in California for doors to remain unlock during business hours.  Not sure what is going on in there when  the doors are locked during business hours but I will be calling the the authorities to check.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< gmap_id>

When COVID began, 2 different times I went I have had to wait at a parking spot, after being told by the worker at the window where everyone receives there food to park in one of their pick up locations, our food will be out "soon".  I don't know what the worker define as "soon", they could have poor communication which is not acceptable. The first time I was required to go inside and ask for my food, the second time I was required to call the manager about this. This is poor service,  and should be a little more organized for fast food. Having customers sit there, while everyone behind them receives a bag. To add in both times were, about a 10-15 minutes wait, which is ridiculous and the food was cold.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809468ed4d8a752d:0xe97b47da3fde36c3< /GmapID></record>

Staff was nice. Not rude whatsoever. Food was what you expect from McDonalds. I like coming to this McDonald's even though it's way outta my route oh and it's one in at least 10 that still uses actual happy meal boxes instead of bags, I like that. Keeps the happy meal more authentic.Authentic smile from kids when they open the box.Thank you.</text>

This location barely passes for a McDonald’s franchise. The employees are unfriendly and get the orders wrong most of the time. The fries are undercooked every time I’ve ordered from here and the sodas aren’t balanced meaning they taste like soda water because they’re mixed poorly. When my order never came out to curbside after waiting 10 minutes I had to go in to get it and the order given to me was wrong. When I complained to the manager about it she just rolled her eyes.<//Text>

For fast food, this place was quick, professional, and clean. Play area is new and pretty good sized. Boys enjoyed the projector came that let them play on the floor<//text>

<Review>This McDonald's sucks worse than any I have ever been to. First of all, the manager was yelling so loudly and annoyingly I could barely hear the register girl. Then we got our order and we had an extra coffee, missing sandwich, and a missing hashbrown. I used to work here, and as we are taught, if customers are missing food, you put it on a tray for them. YOU DO NOT TOUCH THE FOOD. The manager just gave us the food with no tray and she touched the hashbrown. That was repulsive for me. Do not eat here.<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPs9PEzu9VySjMYUNN0APJc_zU8R2TarVFzvbKv=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Response>

<review>We usually grab Taco Bell next door because when we go to McDonals, our orders are rarely correct, maybe 1-2 out of 10 orders do they get it right.

Unfortunately this restaurant is nearby, unfortunately they consistently get our order wrong.< /review>< Response>

Never had a problem at this location before, I even skip the McDonald's right next to my house to go to this location. Justin needs to be dragged through the drive thru window by his braces. So rude. And 2 managers are witnessing him go back and forth with me and not doing anything about it. As soon as I'm done writing this, I'm gonna be KAREN and call corporate.</Text>

The manager who mangers this McDonald’s treats her employees horrible. She yells at them, mocks them and makes the feel bullied at least that how I felt before I quit after she suspended me for asking for past pay stubs . She has no self control and she doesn’t know how to deal w certain situations. I don’t understand why she’s still there, I’m surprised the health department still hasn’t found her reused oil she keeps in the back . I wanted to talk to the owner about her unprofessional work ethic but neither her or the owners secretary would give me the opportunity to speak about how humiliated I felt . She wrote on my suspension paper that I went into her office Demanding my stubs which as not true and when I told her I’d report the event to someone she said she didn’t care , she told me to report her to Donald trump . It’s really sad that someone that Runs a restaurant like this one can treat her employees like animals.</Text><Rate>1</Rate><UserId.>102084054227455719344</UserId.></record>

Horrible service... Fries were cold and hard. They got upset when I asked for fresh fries. Sandwiches and nuggets were cold and tasted funny. Called back since nothing but the drinks tasted good. Manager argued with me about my food being fresh. Sadly, it's not the first time the food was not fresh at this location.</text>

Cold, chewy fries. Cold chicken. Come on Quality Control, pay attention. Throw it out. Don't waste our time. I'd rather wait a few extra minutes than take my food back and wait even longer.</review>

This McDonalds is clean and remodeled.  They have a fun table that lights up for kids and a play area with a small slide and equipment.  The cashier was argumentative and wouldn't let me order a 6 piece happy meal that was on the menu.  He wanted to correct me and tell me it was a 4 piece and he had to charge me for the 2 extra nuggets.  Also, order was wrong when it came out.< /text>

I came almost at 10:00pm and there wasn't many customers at the time, but service still wasn't good. Sure, it's a fast food place, but the least they could do is greet the customer at the drive thru. We had to say hello 4 times and they finally answered but they still didn't listen to our order and almost didn't input some items. Then we waited about 8 minutes for our order at the window. And even though it was a long wait, they still managed to mess up the order and didn't give us an item. Will be avoiding this place for a while.<//Review>

McDonald's is a typical tasteless yes sometimes tasty food with a lot of options to choose from. They are always in a convenient location and sometimes it get good service and sometimes I get bad service. Understand that they do have plenty of orders all of the time so they are always busy and they usually will mess up an order so make sure you always check your bag before you go on about your business. They have ice T's, burgers, fries, ice cream, and breakfast food options.< /Review>

Well I’ve lived in this area for 20 years and this is the first time I’ve ever heard of this business doing that so after 20 years of business you will no longer be receiving my business or my family‘s business< /Review>< Pictures>

It is pretty clean, the people are rude and act like you're a jerk when you ask for your drink that they forgot. Food is hit and miss. All condiments(salt pepper ketchup) and napkins are kept behind their counter.< /Review>

This place has no set hours,  they say they open at 5am go 5:10 no one answers. Had that occur there numerous times at different times  no one evens gets on the speaker to tell  you anything. i since gone to the star bucks across the street  you pay more but they have customer service. which this McDonalds is lacking.<//review>

< Review>
The least of my problems tonight was getting the wrong sized drink, which shouldn't have happened to begin with considering I had to repeat myself 3 different times on what size I wanted. To then get home and find both my sandwich and fries ice cold? Disappointing.<//Review>

The staff is very friendly and professional, the booths in the main area are old and worn but the other seating is in good condition and  has an old diner/ music theme to it. The playroom has been around for awhile. Overall the service is great though.</Review>

I rarely do go to this McDonald's. But decided to go since it was the only one on my way home and the kids were asking for McD's. I placed my order through drive thru..and after paying I waited 25 minutes to recieve my order!!! 25 minutes waiting on the 2nd window, while other cars recieved their orders and others were parked on the side as well. They came twice to me to ask if my order was so and so. I told them it wasn't and told them my order again. They just responded "Oh". My order consisted of 6 mcchickens and 1 order of 20 piece mcnuggets. I have placed larger orders and received it in less amount of time. I was disappointed with the wait time..< /Text>

<Review>The food is decent, it's Mcdonalds so what do you expect but the fries here are not the Golden Standard. The workers are the friendliest of all the McDonald's in town but they will defend themselves. The only people who have experienced bad customer service are the people who are bad customers. They will replace anything you want without any hassle. They are not 24 hours!! Stop complaining about it, people have lives outside of work and they should be living them.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

When I first arrived the lane to the drive-thru was long so I parked and I got off to order there was only one person ahead of me already waiting for their food I continue to wait 10 minutes past and I'm still waiting for my food the manager asked the person working on my food order why they hadn't started on my order and their response was that they didn't know a girl who took my order was very rude and I wasn't finished with my sentence when she would reply with the are you done? I finally received my order nearly at 20 minutes waiting<//review>

WORST McDonald's ever. Workers are all weird just stand there staring at you instead of taking your order. They all looked like they had just got high . Managers are worst then the workers. I would but 0 stars but I don't that option. Defiantly would NOT  recommend!!! Not a family friendly environment .</review>

If you want a bad McDonald's experience this is the one to go to...poor management...wrong order and horrible food preparation...and they just don't care about the customer here...and the manager won't call you back...<//text>

This is the third time I have gone to this McDonald's and I don't need it McDonald's very often. But every single time I have gone to this McDonald's or has either been a problem with my food the service was crappy or they couldn't give me what I wanted cuz they were out of it or they already closed their grills or it wasn't time for them to serve it I will no longer be going to this McDonald's</review>

The staff is friendly, and the food is amazing. I'm Filipino and this is as authentic as you can get. The sisig has the right amount of vinegaryness and little bits of crunch so you know its fresh, the pork in the Pinakbet is thick and juicy. The pork sinigan is especially sour. Everything like Mom used to make. I also got some Turon for .50 cents each and it was sweet, salty, and crunchy - the trifecta. Highly recommend you stop by if you're in the area. Shoot I drove 35 min to get here.

The only criticism I have is that the pinakbet didnt have that much ampalay.</Text>

begins. Enjoy this place, usually has a good variety, friendly staff, large open seating area. Gave it a three because when the food is gone, the food is gone, then they close up shop. Often times before the listed closing times. I recommend you call ahead and call early when there is plenty of food still. Would be nice to see them start a sit and order type experience when their pre-made food is gone.< /review>

The food here is good but the service is a little disappointing.  We went in 2 hours before the place closed and they said they wouldn't make any more Pancit bc it was almost closing time.... really?!? I'll be back bc the options in sac are limited but a little bummed about the Pancit. And my lechon was the worst I've had here it was dry and really really hard I didn't eat half of the tiny portion they gave me ( they were running out of food). To me I would have been embarrassed to serve what they gave out.< /text>

I love the menudo and the pancit here. Their fried bananas and lumpia are also very good. If you come Sundays around noon be prepared to wait a while because they usually have long lines then.</Text>

Decent menu choices. Just need to find out the schedule for your favorite dish. Pork Adobo and Pinakbet was good. Pancit was good also with plenty of food for about 7$. They have tasty sweets also. They have a good amount of tables and chairs with plenty of space.< /review>

The lumpia didn't taste like any I've ever had ( not good). The pansit was just your run off the mill Chinese take out noodles. Not a fan.<//review>< pictures>

The Food was Delicious. Especially the Pancit ,Chicken Adobo, Menudo, and of Course the Lumpia. Very expensive place so if your on a Budget this will fit into it. The people are very Polite and extremely Nice. They made me feel at home.< /text>

I'm glad there's a decent Filipino food restaurant nearby. This place is clean and the people running the place are nice and friendly. The food is priced reasonably and the serving is generous. My personal favorite is the pork sinigang (you can request for extra "sabaw") I have also tried their beef caldereta, pork menudo, and pork kare-kare (surprisingly good as I am used to beef kare-kare). Their lechon kawali is often freshly fried which makes it deliciously crispy. They also sell popular Filipino kakanin. If you're a fan of Filipino food, try this place out... you won't get disappointed.< /Text>

<text>Pretty solid place, with good prices and a lot of seating! I ordered a super burrito and used the $2 off by checking in on yelp, and my friend got the shrimp tacos. Overall, a nice place to go to if I'm nearby but for me not really worth it to go out of my way to eat.
I enjoyed the salsa bar, but even the hottest salsas weren't as spicy as I thought they would be.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<date>1524615824582</date><rating>5</rating><Review>This place is awesome for the hand made tortillas and quesadillas. Have been stopping by here for years now... ever since they were at the original location around the corner on Mission before the 6th Street bridge construction. If you are in the downtown Los Angeles area, you have to stop by for a bite. You won't regret it. Don't mind the location and pop up tent look, it's always felt safe if that worries some. They usually open until 3 pm, but I didn't ask if that went for the weekends also. Price for the quesadillas have gone up to $4 as of April 2018 and $3 for the aguas frescas. Forgot the other item prices as I always go for a quesadilla and horchata.< /Review>< Pics>

Absolutely delicious quesadillas, I had asada, cheese and crema, delicious.  After my soda I paid $7.  Can't complain at all, tortilla hand made, food was hot and fresh.  Waited about ten minutes, but it's fresh, so you definitely can't complain.</review>

Quesadillas are so good the flor y calabasa and cesina are the best! The salsas are good but need a bit more flavor and heat. We will definitely be back! All had a sope de asada and it is huge and delicious definitely worth the price which wasn't bad at all!< /text>

Great vet office and staff here are very nice. The vet doctors explain everything well and are great. We have been bringing our cat here since she was a kitten. Parking is pretty easy also.< /Review>

I scheduled a check up and a dental cleaning for my rescue kitty, Senor Perry, and I was impressed by Plaza del Amo Animal Hospital. The reception staff was extremely helpful and caring from the moment I entered the clinic. I explained that my cat was semi-feral and needed to be in a quiet place away from barking dogs. He was immediately placed in a quiet room waiting for the doctor.
Dr. Ogino is an incredibly nice, caring human being, very professional and extremely good with cats. She saw how terrified my boy was and even sprayed Feliway in the room to calm him down.
She did a great job with cleaning my kitty's teeth and even took before and after pictures to show me what she did. I did not expect that. She also took ample time afterwards to explain the blood tests in great detail, advising me how to care best for my senior boy in the future. In my 15+ years of animal rescue, I can honestly say Dr. Ogino is one of the most honest and caring doctors I have ever met, delivering a great quality of care for my boy.

I will definitely come to Plaza Del Amo again and bring my kittens here as well. Thanks Lisa, for running this great hospital and showing so much care for Senor Perry and the other furry patients.<//Text>

We have had multiple pets that we have taken to Plaza Del Amo and have always had positive experiences. We just went through the difficult time of putting our beloved senior pup down and they were wonderful throughout. Now we've added a new pup to the family and they are very thorough, knowledgeable and helpful in getting us back in puppy mode.< /review>

I have a rescue pet a dog who had 5 different homes.  He's very insecure but here they take very good care of him.  Because of the pandemic it's hard to find a place to trim his nails.  They do a great job you call from your parking spot outside they come get your pet and you wait in your car .  Perfect easy and convenient.<//Text>

Although I didn’t get to meet the Dr in person, talking to her on the phone I could tell she was being honest with me about what was wrong with my dog. The Dr’s treatment plan has worked great and my dog is feeling much better. So glad I brought my dog here!! The staff was very nice.</Text>

I love dr. Holder and Ivanna, they are sweet and professional. I brought my cat in as an emergency since my usual vet was not around during the pandemic. Dr Holder was great and my cat was taken care of,  she even provided me with a referral to a cat cardiologist. I liked her so much that I brought my other 2 cats to her and we could not be happier. Erica and Diana are great, they don’t let you forget your follow ups. Overall I’m very happy with this place. Great doctor and staff. 10 stars ⭐️</Text>

I have been going to this animal hospital for years.  Although the vets have changed over the years, I have never had one I didn’t like.  They have always been very thorough and knowledgeable.  All the staff has always been kind and gentle with all of my animals and you can tell they are genuine animal lovers.  Years ago, they really worked with me when I was running animal rescue years ago, it’s just a friendly and safe place for pets.</text>

<text>Dr. Holder saw our dog on an emergency basis and quickly discerned what was wrong with our pet.  The vets here are careful not to over prescribe or try to over test yet they give us confidence they know what our pet needs. We have been bringing our pet here for about four or five years.< /text>< pictures>

Every experience has been a good one.  The office staff is very knowledgeable, friendly and efficient.
The veterinarians are the best.  We are especially happy with the treatment we have received from Dr. Child. Can't say enough good things about her.< /review>

<Text>I have been going to this hospital for about 15 years and have always been impressed with the compassionate professional care I receive for my dogs. The current Doctors are all great. I have had exceptional experiences with Dr. Liu and Dr. Ogino. They are both extremely compassionate and knowledgeable and very generous with their time. I have gone through some difficult times over the years including The injury of one pet and the loss of another due to age and kidney disease.  They have both gone the extra mile to ease the suffering of my pets and give me the peace of mind when I needed it the most. Also, the support staff is professional, friendly and very caring with me and my dogs.  This excellent care has continued through the Covid restrictions. I will be forever grateful that Dr. Ogino allowed me to be present during euthanasia when I had to say goodbye to my beloved Darby during the pandemic. She was wonderful and I couldn’t have asked for a more supportive experience during such a sad time.  I would highly recommend this hospital to everyone who loves their fur babies and wants top-notch care. Thank you to the entire hospital!<//Text>< name>

The staff and Dr Child are fabulous as I am sure the other doctors are also - the facility is modern and most tests are performed and processed during your visit, which I certainly like - they are all kind and caring people who obviously love animals - so glad I found them 2 years ago when at the time I had a very sick dog< /review>

We waited in the car until someone came to escort Ricki, our Shih-tzu into Plaza Del Amo Animal Hospital. She had a clip board with a few questions on it. We waited again until he was examined and then Dr Holder called me. It was quick, efficient and an all around good experience even for Ricki who is not at all happy going to the vet.< /Review>

<Review>I have been going to Plaza Del Amo Animal Hospital for years as it was close to my work.  I have never been disappointed in their quality of care  even though they are a tad bit more expensive then other veterinarians, they are very much worth the extra expense.  Yesterday I took our baby there and they were able to get us in right away. Even with COVID-19 going on, they were very attentive to our needs. Dr Oguino and the staff performed an exam and tests immediately, emailed the results to myself for review and followed it up with phone calls right away.  In less than 2 hours, we were on the way to a specialty center where the results had been emailed to, awaiting for our arrival. They did and have always treated my babies with the utmost care and tenderness.< /Review>< GmapID>

And an emergency happened (can't discuss the details) but suffice it to say, the Plaza Del Amo Animal Hospital folks took care of it. They were both professional and caring. Thank you for being good to our Marbles!<//Text><Date>1536131805984<//Date></record></dataset><record>
<pics>None<//pics><Text>I was looking around the South Bay for a place to board my two pups. I visited and toured a half dozen places and nearly gave up.  On a recommendation by my friend I came to plaza. From the moment I stepped in I was blown away. I was greeted by friendly and professional staff, the place was cleaner and smelled better than the others. The actual accommodations were spacious, clean and comfortable.  The most important thing that stood out to me was, although full, the kennels were quiet.  Happy, RELAXED, and healthy pups wagged their tails in endorsement as I toured the facility. The sign up process was quick and easy. When I found out that the rates were lower than the others and included more pampering I booked it immediately. I  feel confident and comfortable about leaving my family here.</Text><time>1531377614176<//time><user_name>Mark Barsoum</user_name><Gmap_id>0x80dd4ae04492d747:0x6f338f8f8e1dd019< /Gmap_id>< Rating>

They are great with all my pets. I’m a pet sitter and I recommend them to all my clients! They are compassionate and caring. They don’t try to get you to run all kinds of tests to spend lots of money like a lot of other vets do. I highly recommend them. The front of the house is great as well as all the docs! Thank you!😻😻😻< /review>

Plaza Del Amo Animal Hospital & Pet Keeper is by far the best place to take your furry family member for all health and boarding needs. My pup Axel is one nervous little baby and the staff treated him with so much love and care, it truly makes a difference.

Thank you all for your amazing service, it keep us coming back!

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Rhinestone Cowboy (my dog) and I both enjoyed our visit to Plaza Del Amo Animal Hospital and we look forward to our next appointment.  Dr. Sinnott is very knowledgeable, courteous, and professional, which is also true for everyone else we met there.  Rhinestone is normally very healthy, however he recently developed some issues that other vets were not able to treat effectively.  Dr. Sinnott and the staff at Plaza Del Amo Pet Hospital were able to successfully treat Rhinestone during our visit and he is already showing substantial improvement.  I understand the course of treatment recommended and I think it is very smart so we are following it precisely.  If your pet needs a vet go to Plaza Del Amo Animal Hospital!  I wish I would have know about this vet sooner.</Review>< Pics>

Taking my young 2 1/2 yr pup Hollywood to Plaza Del Amo Pet Hospital was a very easy, friendly and efficient. The Veterinary team was great and I felt they truly cared for Holly's overall canine health and happiness.  I was able to schedule quickly and got all of my pups needs taken care of. I would recommend Plaza Del Amo Pet Hospital to anyone who loves their pet and wants them treated with love and kindness. Thank you,  Hollywood's mom< /Text>

We rescued a puppy and had no idea where to begin. We brought him to Plaza Del Amo and they were so helpful. The vet we met with was in no rush and explained thoroughly what we had in store for us.
Being new puppies owners on a budget they really work with you on the best financial decisions and work with the companies for fleas, vaccinations for rebates and coupons.
We have also had to leave out of town and we have left Milo at the facility which has turned out awesome. Very affordable and they truly love the animals that stay there and take very good care of them.<//text>

Dr. Ogino is the best veterinarian. Very caring, comprehensive, honest, and sincerely concerned about each of her patients -- both furry and human! There are many veterinarians closer to me but I drive further to Plaza Del Amo because of Dr. Ogino.  Thank you!< /review>

When I arrived the place was clean inside and the staff were very polite and gave me a proper greeting . I was not waiting long to get seen and the team of staff working with the Dr were wonderful and very helpful to any questions I had. The best part of it was Doctor Pope she gave me a detailed description of everything that was going on with my dog she explained it all and if I didnt know something she would make sure I understood  what it meant . She answered all my questions .I was in and out with my dog in a hour and a half and I am very pleased to say " Marshmello " is 99% better already and that is what happens when you find a good Vet . I highly recommend this place to everyone. Thanks to the Staff & Dr at Plaza Del Amo Hospital.<//Text>< resp>

I have been going to Plaza Del Amo Animal Hospital for 10+ years. Have taken all my pets there, and although changes have occurred throughout the years, and I'm down to one dog, I still go to Plaza Del Amo. It's easy to get any appointment, the doctors are great, as well as the reception staff. They also have boarding and grooming facilities on-site. Have used both & can't recommend them enough. Junior, their head groomer is the best! I absolutely do not know how he gets my Chorkie to stay still long enough to bathe him & give him his "summer" cut all year long. Very happy this pet haven is so near to my home.</text>

We have boarded our dog, Muna, there with Pet Keepers several times, and he has LOVED staying with them every time. I can tell because every time we go back, he greets the caregivers with enthusiasm, wagging his tail, leaning against their legs, and sitting on their feet, his way of expressing affection (not to mention lots of kisses, if they will let him). This enthusiasm extends to the medical care staff as well: recently we had to deal with a persistent bout of abdominal upset probably triggered by stress and a water and diet change from our move from the desert to the South Bay. The staff were very caring with Muna, caring and gentle, reassuring and careful to explain everything to me. The vet, Dr. Moeller, took extra time to sit down with me and discuss all the options for possible diagnoses from best to worst case scenarios, and different testing and treatment strategies. They gave me the information I needed to make informed decisions, and allowed me to make the best decisions I could afford given all the factors in our lives. I am happy to say that thanks to their care, Muna has returned to his normal bouncy good health, and in spite of his advanced age, we're looking forward to several more years with our happy, healthy dog!</Text>

<review>If you care for your dog's well being, do not board them here. After a three night stay, we picked up our dog to find her covered in urine and diarrhea and her nose rubbed raw from the kennel gate. She was also wearing her harness, which had been tightened so much that she could barely walk. Not to mention that it took more than 20 minutes for them to simply go get her from her kennel when we picked her up. A combination of negligence and incompetence makes this a nightmarish location to board your pup.<//review>< Pictures>

<time>1364713620900</time><rate>2< /rate><text>It was my first time using The Pet Keeper service. I'm with a rescue and we needed a dog to board for 2 nights. I got a call from the veterinarian the next morning. It seems he developes an upper respiratory infection. I asked how much a check up would be and she said she already did it and so it would be another $51. I explained that no one called me and a URI is definitely no emergency. Thankfully, she said she'd waive the fee since no one told me. I also found out later that they called my emergency contact BEFORE trying to contact me. Odd. So I asked if I can come pick him up early so he wouldn't have to stay a second night. They said, "Sure, you can get him anytime between 8-4pm today and you won't have to pay for his whole stay." I thought, great! I'm going to use this place again! But then I arrived at 11:28am. And the woman at the front desk said if it's after 11am, I get charged for a second day. Even though I explained no one told me this, she said she couldn't help. So I said, well I might as well keep him here tonight as planned. Nope. She said if I did, they'd now charge me an extra $45 to put him in isolation and for a Sunday pickup. When I initially called, it was $30 per night for two nights. So I was thinking $60 plus the antibiotics for $17. Nope. I get charged for three days for a drop off on Friday at 4pm and a pickup Sunday at 8am. At $45 a night plus $2 for each pill administration. Basically going from only $60 a night to $150. And he just went to the vet literally before he went to Pet Keeper who gave him the all clear. There is some shady business practices here. Anything they can do to make a dime. If in had been there at 10:50am it would've been $45 for the meds and one night stay, instead, because they said he could be picked up anytime that day and I came at 11:28am I was charged $76. Horrible service. They were rude the whole time. I was shocked. I'm a rescuer and have been looking for good groomers, vets amd boarding in the area for our many pets and clients. I thought they were it, but now, I'm telling everyone to go elsewhere.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>On a chilly, wintry post-rain morning in LA it’s tempting to just stay curled up in bed under the sheets. Especially on a Monday. So you can imagine my relief after nudging myself out of bed to kick start the week with a jolt of caffeine at The Assembly. Nico’s oat milk cappuccino was consumed in under the two miles it took to get home. Smooth, balanced, perfect. Swing by, show your support.<//Review>< pictures>

Modern coffee at its best. A great coffee shop focused on serving you a great cup. My boyfriend and I just love this place. This is a place where everyone is social and nice. We also liked the staff members for they always make sure that you are welcomed and have great integrity in their way of making your cup of coffee. We had a great time here!< /text>

The cold brew is on point! The ambiance is supper cute! It's a great spot to get work done. Although, it can become a bit noisy.

The staff are supper friendly and helpful. I also love the stamp cards that they have.

Parking sucks, VALET only.</review>

<Review>I've traveled all through Europe and Casa Cordoba is definitely in the ranks with the best of them.

Pretty courtyard tapas/Spanish restaurant.
If it's a nice night---sit outside. They had live guitar and singing tonight.
Sounded lovely.

The seating inside is adequate---perhaps better for people with kids?

We were a party of 5 and we ordered many dishes to share.

The Gazpacho (or their version of it) was worth coming back here again and again.
Bring an antacid for those with delicate tummies.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Nice cozy place, good coffee, the also have a terrace where you can enjoy the weather.
The price for cappuccino is 4,50, $4 for the croissant (wasn’t the freshest one though), latte or matcha is about $5, I believe.

Comparing to Starbucks, the prices are the same level, but the cup is smaller, but the quality is way better, as well as the atmosphere.

I would come again, good location for me.< /review>< Name>

What started as a quick stop to grab a matcha or tumeric chai before Yoga has slowly but surely become one of my favorite spots to meet with friends or get some reading or work done. Between the owner Brian's great team of hip and friendly staff, some of the best drinks in town, and having a cool back patio area The Assembly has found a way to become a one of a kind coffee shop in a town with so many.<//text>

I really enjoyed studying at this cafe! There's not a ton of seating but we still managed to snag a table around 2 PM on a Saturday! There's ample street metered parking. I love how minimal and bright the space is. The outdoor area has a potted plant wall and is really a nice airy space to chat with friends or read a book. I got an americano with a splash of almond milk & it was a good cup of coffee. They stop selling their house drip coffee around noon just FYI. The baristas are really welcoming and warm. I really enjoyed studying here with my friend and will be back!<//text>

The place takes the cake for the most expensive iced latte I've ever had. But it also takes the cake for the most delicious! I had the vanilla cinnamon iced latte. It was superb! The barista was friendly as well and the ambience is quite peaceful.👍🙂</review>

Pricey yet nothing to highlight apart from the location. Poor customer service and cold interior, I noticed everyone took away but me.< /Text>

A fantastic cup of (Counter Culture) coffee: perfect pour-over, a delicious cappuccino, a great pulled shot. Good luck finding a parking spot once the crowd picks up!</Review>

It’s a coffee shop with some baked goods and sandwiches selection. It also has some bottled juice for sale. There’s tables and counter space in the back with an outdoor area too. It’s a great hangout space but I wouldn’t study here cause the music is kinda loud.</review>

<Text>In the past year the place has really gone downhill. The shop is still really nice to visit, the location is convenient, but the folks that work there are really clueless. These days they can't answer the most basic questions about what they serve, the coffee isn't so great and the espresso drinks on the skids. If there's someplace you rather go, I suggest you do.

A year ago here's what I said....
Here's what you need to know:
The lattes, whether hot or iced, are amazing. The coffee is amazing. Everything they put in a cup is amazing. The Assembly has to be one of LA's best coffee shops.

<Text>(Translated by Google) It is a coffee shop with a lot of nice people with neat interiors on a quiet road. Parking is convenient if you go to the parking lot across the street. The restroom is inside and there is no difficulty when ordering.

한적한 길에 깔끔한 인테리어의 멋진 사람들이 많은 커피숍이다. 주차는 건너편 주차장에 하면 편하다. 화장실은 내부에 있고, 주문할 때 어려움은 없다.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2beaf1758aae9:0x5f401b49c4407bbd<//Gmap_id>< Date>

Location location location. They have a nice little Harbor and they're very close to Balboa Island. It's not the KOA and can be a little pricey. Is an absolute zoo on the weekends.<//Review>

<Review>Beautiful. The Jaws on the water was poorly executed. Parking was half a mile away, more if you sat far away. You couldn't hear the movie in the back and the inner tube fill up locations had lines so long people were still filling tubes over halfway through the movie. Wrong time of year too as the water was too cold.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dce0760690e111:0x520953c652df2d85< /GmapID></record>

Always very clean, staff is super friendly and the docks are in great condition and very sturdy. My only beef is the bridge that separates one side of the dunes from the other. If I have two jobs, one on each side of the dunes, I either have to lug all my tools across the bridge or drive the truck out and around to the other side.<//Review>

<review>Salt Oasis is the place I come almost daily to unwind and reset from the hectic day.  Staff are super friendly - Marli always greets with a smile and attentive to clients.  Amber is knowledgeable in "all things Salt". She takes on new visitors and gives them tours and answers all questions.  I love when she brings in new customers into the cave and teaches them good breathing exercises... I follow along breathing with them each time when I'm in there!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I recently started going to salt therapy and my good friend Amber introduced me to this amazing location and to the place itself.  As someone that really works out alot especially boxing and hitting the bags, this place is a good place to recover! I was  happy to be introduced by Amber and I use salt therapy to help my breathing, recovery for aching muscles, and stress relief. I recommend this place to any one and to anyone that was wants to destress and find a way to improve their breathing</Text>

<Review>Salt Oasis is a must for everyone!!!  Whether you have allergies or just need to relax!!! The staff is awesome!!! Marli & Amber have gone up and beyond with being informative on how much the products can help our health as well as our families❤ My mother has started having neuropathy pain in her feet from her diabetes. We started with the salt foot soaks & it helped  tremendously!!! Then on a visit to get more, Amber told me about the foot detox stone. It's so awesome with the pain & stiffness my mother has in her feet!!!! Don't hesitate to love on your self & feel better♡ Go visit Salt Oasis & have them guide you & your family to a better quality of life❣ 💗 Tracy</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>Salt oasis is truly an oasis🌞 if you know anything about the benefits of salt lamps then you will fall in love with the salt cave here. The facility is so clean, very friendly and helpful staff. I went once and was hooked, regular customer now❤️ Looking for a beautiful salt lamp? They have many to choose from! Worth checking it, I’m sure you will find it just as wonderful as I have.<//Review>< Pictures>

What an amazing experience I had at the Salt Oasis. My Son and I made appointments for the Breathing Chair and than the Salt Therapy Session.  It was unlike any experience I have ever had at a Wellness Center.  After the Breathing chair I felt a sense of Euphoria and complete calmness. The Salt Therapy was so relaxing and Therapeutic.  Both my Son and I left feeling transformed. We will definitely be regular clients as we have discovered a new way to enhance our health.  Thank you Salt Oasis</text>

First time session booked in the Salt Cave at Salt Oasis today and WOW, what an experience! Absolutely beautiful setting and very appealing to all the senses...most definitely felt like an escape. Looking forward to another session. Will definitely book a full body massage plus body wrap as well. So happy with my Himalayan salt lamp too- it's shaped as a pyramid!< /Text>

<Text>Been going for years!  This is quite a unique experience.  If you haven't been in here, you'll immediately be transported into a serene and relaxing space. You'll forget about the outside world once you step into the salt cave or any of the salt rooms.  This is a wonderful meditative and healing space and their sound healing classes adds to a different level of energy healing.  A perfect place to alleviate my allergies and chest congestion.   I love Bruno and his amazing staff and how they advocate for true health and wellness.</Text>< pics>

An incredible and beautiful experience thanks to the amazing and tentative staff. They treat you with such attention it makes you feel instantly relaxed and ready to unwind. So much attention to detail in the decor of the place. The caves are designed with walls made of literal rare and high quality salt. Really unique and releasing experience.</text>

Salt Oasis is amazing. I have been going for salt sessions for about a year and a half. I have always had respiratory problems and can breathe much better since I have been going. Also it is very relaxing and restful. The staff is friendly and professional. I would highly recommend Salt Oasis.< /text>

One of the best hidden gems around! Tucked away in Rancho Cucamonga Salt Oasis has quickly become my go to when it comes to taking someone to a special relaxing place for a birthday gift, recovery from a hard time in life or just celebrating a friendship. I was a skeptic a year ago on the whole salt lamp, salt therapy thing. Today I can honestly say I’m a believer. I have many lamps in my home and can say I’ve noticed a difference. My sessions at Salt Oasis have been beneficial, relaxing and always leave me looking forward to my next visit.</Text>

My family always has a wonderful experience at the Salt Oasis.  Bruno and his team take spectacular care of us.  The experience is like nothing we have had before.  We had a yoga class in one of the salt caves and felt great afterward.  The salt added to the class.

My daughter also visited when she had a cold and felt dramatically better after she left after spending a session in the salt cave.

Going in the caves regularly is the best way to get the benefits of the salt.  Visit Bruno and his caves, I am sure you will love them like we do.<//review>

First  let me start by saying I have been going to Salt Oasis for a little over a 3 years. The staff here makes you feel like one of a big happy family, while still being professional.

When I started I had asthma, I know how have no signs I'm asthma. I have not used an inhaler for more than 9 months, I don't even know where it is. I m  far healthier now since I'm not using a chemical inhaler. The salt Oasis is excellent for many types of ailments, far too many to mention in this text.

The salt Oasis offers many other types of services such as massage, yoga, breathing chairs and sound bath. Please do yourself a huge favor and check this place out. You will be happy that you did.</review>

I am in love with this place. This past weekend, for the first time, I had my first session at Salt Oasis. It was amazing!!! The staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable, Carolina gave us a tour also explained everything related to the benefits from Himalayan salt therapy, she also gave us information regards the historical background and origin of salt therapy. I ended up buying a session package for my friend and I, strongly considering the idea of getting a membership. I totally recommend this wellness center not only to obtain the health benefits but also to get away from the stressful daily routine.</Text>

My first time doing salt therapy. I didn't know much about it other than it helps with respiratory issues that my 3 year old has. It's been one day since then and his breathing at night has improved by ATLEAST 50%. I feel that if I keep going, it will help him 100%. Staff was knowledgeable and answered the many questions I had. I really loved how passionate they were explaining the benefits and classes. They didn't just memorize something on Google, it was apart of their life. Beautiful place. Definitely going back.</Text>

I was truly a skeptic of this salt therapy stuff. After each of my 2 sessions, I felt energized, similar to how I feel after a massage. The staff is very knowledgeable about the benefits of salt therapy. Definitely recommend this place!< /Text>

This place does not fall short of the name oasis! It is beyond relaxing and rejuvenating. Definitely recommend the salt cave for optimal relaxation, although these are not always private sessions. My kids LOVE going too!</Text>

Such an amazing place and a great experience! I will definitely be back. I was questioning if the salt would actually do anything for me and it did! I’m amazed! I usually have horrible seasonal allergies which causes a stuffy/runny nose and post nasal drip. It is now the day after I visited the Salt Oasis and I don’t have the annoying post nasal drip that I had before and my sinuses have seemingly cleared up ☺️ I don’t think this is a coincidence! Beautiful space, inviting and with good energy. Lastly, all the staff members we were in contact with were helpful, knowledgeable and very friendly!</text>

I had never heard of salt therapy, if that is even the correct term, but it was a pretty cool experience. My husband and I went for our anniversary, I enjoyed it more than he did but it's still worth a try. It's less expensive than a massage with probably maaaaaany more health benefits.</review>

I’ve been going here for two months and I have to say it has helped me so much! My allergies are almost nonexistent where as before they were so terrible I was talking two different medications for them. Not only that the salt therapy rooms are absolutely beautiful.</Review>

< Review>
Best drinks in Pasadena. Covid friendly. Pick up your canned cocktail (taken from tap and bottled in front of you) and run it home. Seriously talented cocktail designer. Has to be the best I've had since moving to California six years ago. (I hear they're also working on outdoor space for August)

My rec: Strawberry Buck. Has a bite but so tasty.< /Review>

<Review>Incredible food. Wow, the apple pie, brie burger is mindblowing. The fried chicken sandwich was really good too. Ambience, music and service quality incredible too. They constantly keep feeling your water and they are very knowledgeable and detailed when describing the food. Great experience and I would come back. It is somewhat pricey though.< /Review>< gmap_id>

Super chill atmosphere. Lots of space to sit or even lounge in couches. I can't speak on behalf of the food, but the drinks are absolutely incredible! They definitely have their own version of cocktails that I've never had before.

I was originally going to give four stars but on the last drink the bartender actually came over to our table and lit it on fire and did an entire show, it was so awesome! It was called the forbidden. He said he doesn't always do it tableside, so don't expect it, but when he has time he does.

We would recommend this. We will be back for happy hour.< /text>

<user_name>Velvet Overkil< /user_name><date>1548295549331< /date><rate>5</rate><Review>Darkly wood panelled place, dine in the pseudo "old" style. Overstuffed stools, a couch or two and a secondary bar level stooped area make for abundant seating. Service was uneven, as it took the staff over 10 minutes to notice that we were there (not many of them were out) but once we were noticed, a number of servers and associated workers appeared, as if they were all occupied elsewhere and just got let out; it was odd. The service, once the servers were "out", was prompt and professional. Drinks are not cheap but I had the feeling they are trying to represent themselves as an "established" place but the feel was more if an "upscaley" place; we're popular and you're fortunate to be eating our fine food. The food was quite good. The drinks were quite tasty (they know what they're doing) but I wouldn't go there for drinks (too little for what is charged) unless I pulled in 100k yearly, imho.  4.5 STARS<//Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB0USBDrh8qsuGTYdcEoh969SImhVdOfyQgOnT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPf_RJGaTHux0clGRc4RvQmcEIN_Z9WcIokRbk3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMzINCk8g1lpOP2veQydXqdaJ7OVSAYnVdNerw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5</gmapID></record>

<review>White Horse is a really great place to visit for delicious New Orleans Cajun. The food and drinks are very well priced for the outstanding quality you get, and the servers and bartenders are extremely knowledgeable as well. Feel safe when visiting, everything is being done with the COVID best practice requirements. Great happy hour offerings as well, especially for those that like 'Old Fashioneds'. I really liked and appreciated the old school music and old fashioned dim bar surroundings, it really was refreshing. The dark wood and red upholstery The exterior design is very tasteful and catches your attention when passing by. The set up works great for those looking for a group setting or even just for couples. I found the brunch menu to be especially enticing, I'm going to need to come back a couple of times to try out all the things that looked promising. The parking structure is right next door for maximum convenience. This place is truly a hidden gem amongst all the other great places in Pasadena. I'm also looking forward to checking out their sister location, Craft Hill, which I've heard great things about. Brandon was an amazing team member and recommended the fried chicken sandwich, which was fantastic. He knew all the items on the menu almost from memory and went above and beyond to walk me through everything. I'm glad I went with his recommendations. He also told me some cool things to do in the area and South Pasadena, so I have those on my list as well. They don't skip on the portions either, you'll definitely satisfy your appetite and probably have some leftovers as well. I can't think of much they can do to improve things, everything was so great! I plan on visiting again sooner rather than later.<//review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Yan is incredible! The White Horse is making the most of COVID by offering their amazing cocktails on draft and individually canned to go. Everyone should be going to supplement their home drinking experience! 10/10 try the Strawberry Buck!</text>

The White Horse Lounge is a very nice upscale place. They have a fairly decent happy hour, and the staff is always more than accommodating. Fancy cocktails with flowers in them, and some good appetizers in the bar area. They have a restaurant portion as well, but I've honestly never made it that far.</Text>

The food is really amazing and they never have the same menu for a very long time so if you haven't been there in a while you probably missed a few dishes they make some of the amazing southern style dishes like for example fried green tomato you can never find that anywhere else I never see that in any menu in any restaurant at all The atmosphere is very relaxing and amazing a very romantic place. A perfect place for a date< /text>

Went for a date night and the service was amazing, the food was delicious, drinks were tasty and good quality, and the whole ambiance was just cozy and romantic but also casual still. Nice choice of music from all different genres that was perfect volume. Definitely good for groups as well and once the dining area closes you can just move to the bar area that still has cozy seating. Loved it and will be back. Parking is even cheap and easy. Highly recommend.</text>

<review>If I weren't a vegetarian, is give it 5 stars - not a huge menu for us vegetarians, but you gotta know that going in. A really cool vibe, intimate rooms to dine without the bar noise, and a Cajun menu that definitely reminds me of my time in New Orleans. The drinks were really good, too. I had a couple of Strawberry Bucks that were delicious. I wish I'd had more room for dessert.</review>< resp>

Would go earlier for brunch and be early for mimosa's!<//Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOfXJQDViaH4PCq_oFQNeUU1COLYlgpAi628MJ-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNct49qZPKdNfIkYWLgcHeQYd8-uG7-rKlb-4lH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5< /GmapID></record>

The WHL does not disappoint! This was my second time, the first being a late night "bar menu" which is just as spectacular as the main dinning menu. The drinks are creative and tasty and full of flavor. A must if you've never been. Oh and eventually I'll get to the brunch, it's supposed to be even better!</review>

<Review>I don't even know where to start! We came for a group outing and the restaurant is beautiful to start! Tucked away in Old Town Pasadena...the ambiance feels like Louisiana. We had a beautiful room with apropos music and the wait staff were patient, funny and helpful. The food was amazing. Everything we ordered was so good. It was good made from love. Big Josh (Executive Chef) came in and his southern demeanor and wit won us over. We will be coming back to celebrate our anniversary and my birthday soon! You'll be hearing from us Big Josh!

Went for a date night and the service was amazing, the food was delicious, drinks were tasty and good quality, and the whole ambiance was just cozy and romantic but also casual still. Nice choice of music from all different genres that was perfect volume. Definitely good for groups as well and once the dining area closes you can just move to the bar area that still has cozy seating. Loved it and will be back. Parking is even cheap and easy. Highly recommend.< /review>

If I weren't a vegetarian, is give it 5 stars - not a huge menu for us vegetarians, but you gotta know that going in. A really cool vibe, intimate rooms to dine without the bar noise, and a Cajun menu that definitely reminds me of my time in New Orleans. The drinks were really good, too. I had a couple of Strawberry Bucks that were delicious. I wish I'd had more room for dessert.< /text>

<Text>Good food. Bottomless mimosas for brunch. Would have been five stars, but service wasn't so great. We were a large party, maybe that has something to do with it. I ordered the omelette, delicious. The bloody Mary was pretty good too, but small for the price.<//Text>< Pictures>

Pretty pricey on the drinks. Only had fries (amazing), but saw the food on other tables and it all looked very delicious. Music was very diverse, and that's appreciated. Bartenders were friendly, but super slow, I waited at least 20 minutes for drinks on a Thursday night. Seems cool for a date, I was in a group setting. Didnt seem crowded but everywhere I stood I felt "in the way". Not my vibe but I also didn't hate it.< /review>

Only here to pre-game for the Rose bowl. Fantastic spot. Great bartenders. Great service. Small up for front bar.

<Review>Cozy place with an old timey bar feel. We sat in the bar and had good service and some tasty drinks. My hubby and I were out on a date and the music (though good) was very loud and it was hard to hear each other even though we were sitting next to one another - we left after one drink. Probably a fun place if you like super loud music.</Review>< Pictures>

<resp>None< /resp><review>Pretty pricey on the drinks. Only had fries (amazing), but saw the food on other tables and it all looked very delicious. Music was very diverse, and that's appreciated. Bartenders were friendly, but super slow, I waited at least 20 minutes for drinks on a Thursday night. Seems cool for a date, I was in a group setting. Didnt seem crowded but everywhere I stood I felt "in the way". Not my vibe but I also didn't hate it.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great drinks. Great vibe. I didn’t do a 5th star because we didn’t have any food.

Only here to pre-game for the Rose bowl. Fantastic spot. Great bartenders. Great service. Small up for front bar.

Will come back next time in Pasadena to try the menu.</Text><time>1568728806208</time>< resp>

Cozy place with an old timey bar feel. We sat in the bar and had good service and some tasty drinks. My hubby and I were out on a date and the music (though good) was very loud and it was hard to hear each other even though we were sitting next to one another - we left after one drink. Probably a fun place if you like super loud music.</Text>

Good drinks, friendly staff, not totally rip-off prices - which for this location, is pretty d@mned impressive!

One suggestion, they have a "Bartender's choice" drink - ask what it is, but it's probably one of your best bets. Enjoy!< /review>

What a wonderful surprise!! The White Horse Lounge is a great place for family, out of town guest spot, romantic two or just friends! The food is an explosion of flavors and mouth watering treats! I kind you not.The Southern fried chicken is seasoned to delight, the Hoe cake was the best the salmon avec haricot verts satisfies the palate with lightness, and the drinks well let's just say they don't hold back! This place was absolutely perfect and a great customer service.< /text>

I like to cook. I do. I really really do. So I already know when I go out to eat that I can prepare the meal I’m going to eat just as well as the restaurant for a fraction of the price. Therefore service, ambiance, and cleanliness are of the upmost importance to me.

Before I start with the bad I should really say that the food was outstanding. Very flavorful and well presented. The ambiance was relaxed making the White Horse seem like a popular place among the young and old alike. Cleanliness in the bar and restrooms was above average.

My only complaint was the attentiveness and speed of the staff.  Our drink orders took forever. Our food (two dishes) was delivered about fifteen minutes apart and it seems they really didn’t want to bring us the check.

Overall it was a good experience. However, with dozens and dozens of restaurants to choose from, owners/managers must strive for perfection in all aspects of their restaurant and not just the food. When it comes down to it, almost anyone can make a tuna sandwich and mix a drink.</review>

A packed dining room and bar put this place quite in the limelight as you enter on a weekend evening. Unfortunately, there were far too many misses to honestly click on an extra star for the rating.

The bar seriously needs to pay attention to customers. Waiting for my party and waiting at the bar, and trying to get a drink was an impossible 5 minutes. They were treating me like I just came out of an AA meeting.

The menu seems to hit most of the notes for a hungry patron. At first glance, you can see it is well designed. Something for everyone wraps the context of each category. Fine Wagyu meats, a great burger, your standard salmon dish, and an attractive Southern Fried Chicken.

Dig deeper and you can find the pretentiousness of certain items. The use of Wagyu in smoked brisket, for example, is quite a redundancy. Why pay for a Wagyu priced cut that is supposed to be slow-smoked/cooked?

The Jumbalaya Rissoto is in fact not "risotto," and made with orzo pasta. Granted it is stated in the description as orzo, the title is completely misleading. If a person was gluten intolerant this would be a horrific experience. This dish is totally not worthy of the $26 price tag for a pasta dish.

The service felt like the servers were really working hard. I overheard a waiter mumbling about covering 8 large tables. I commend the service timing for everyone at the table.

The drinks here are very good. The bar certainly displays some craft behind their creations. I would return for their happy hour, and possibly a revisit for a sample of other items.

I do miss Cheval Blanc that once took this location to new heights in french cuisine.</Text>

Too many things wrong with this place! The music did NOT match the restaurant!!! Our brussel sprouts were like beef jerky! The mac and cheese was salty, The fried green tomatoes were about the only descent item on the menu. I was asked only once if I wanted a refill (I was drinking Stella) when I said yes they were having problems with the keg. 2 other people we were with ordered mixed drinks and were asked only once. I would have ordered 3 or 4 beers if the server had been more on it. The only thing that made it a tad better was that we were there at happy hour! We will NOT be returning!!</text>

<review>I've only come here for the bar and drinks, never had the food. The drinks are all great, well thought out, and delicious. They switch up the cocktail menu every couple of months, so there's always something new to try as well. For Pasadena, the drinks are fairly priced and the bartenders are super knowledgeable.

It can get pretty packed and hard to flag down someone to order a drink sometimes. It''s a great place to have some drinks before going to a club or just have a chill night talking with some friends.<//review>< pics>

There are better places in Pasadena. Stopped by two nights in a row. First for dinner and the next for drinks. Both experiences left me fairly ready to move on to the next place. Beer options available on tap are decent. Food options are limited although they do provide variety (chicken, beef, seafood, pasta, salad, etc.).<//Review>

This is an old-world style bar and restaurant with a very warmly decorated interior. Giant overstuffed leather couches line one whole side with warm overtones throughout. The bartenders are very well informed on different mixology styles and techniques and are very attentive even when the place is bustling. The food is really great as well, you've got your usual garlic fries and appetizers but their entrees are also excellent. I recommend the burger :)<//review>

Amazing drinks. Have never been disappointed here. Tell the bartender what you like and watch them make you the best drink you ever had! Also I couldn't remember but there are TV's that you can watch from the bar area.<//Review>

Great drinks, and tap beer list (wish it was a little bit more off of the beaten path).

<Review>Great food with a wide variety of options. Not cheap, but not over-priced either and you can't beat the ambiance, location, or level of service. Nestled in the middle of downtown Pasadena, the location is prime as a jumping off point for a nice meal and a couple of drinks before a night out on the town.<//Review></record>

A very nice place. Terrific cocktails. Good service. Quiet setting. The brussel sprouts are really nice and the Boudin balls have great flavor. Salmon on Isreali couscous has a great glaze. The gumbo was ok. Nothing great.
The bread pudding was really average. Go for the beignets instead.
Overall very nice. Just a tic below great< /text>

<rate>5<//rate><review>they must go through a rigorous process with the Bartenders, they can mix a hell of a drink. The Signature drinks are very tasty and well worth it.

The burger was cooked great, very little seasoning allowing you to take in the taste of the beef. You can select Garlic Fries with this which I must say for being a dish you see at a lot places, this really does stand out on it's own. Not overpowering with Parmesan which you find a lot of times.

The Shrimp and Grits was fantastic. Chunks of Chorizo and Hominy really brought out this dish . I really recommend this.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Just know that I love Roy's, and if you get the chance, you should eat there. They have made multiple changes to the menu (added lots of Sushi), and the new dishes are outstanding. Service is spot on and Keith (Managing Partner) makes sure that Roy's is run to the highest standard.</text>

Brett was the best, most helpful bartender I've ever had. He listened and was able to recommend the most amazing Rye and Bourbons as well as making our anniversary so special. The food is decadent, and from the heart of Louisiana. I will most definitely be coming back and bringing my friends.< /Text>

<review>I came here last night for my birthday. First I gotta say the food deserves 5 stars. The food was fresh and delicious. I'm knocking off 3 stars because of our interaction with the Manager Cameron. My wife reserved a room for my birthday party and out of nowhere the waitress let us know we had 10 minutes to clear the room (decorations, etc.) because another party was going to sit there. They  didn't even have another table to transition us to. The waitress was pretty much like, "I guess you can sit at one of the other tables." Odd thing is, once we moved to the outside area we never saw anyone move into where we sitting. So why have us move out? My wife complained to the Manager Cameron about this and he preceded to argue back with my wife for about 30 minutes. He explained to my wife that the party that was going to move into our section decided to stay at the bar area afterall. We will  never be back to this restaurant again, which is a shame because like I said, the food was delicious. The way Cameron handled this situation was poor. Somebody needs to train this guy on how to provide good customer service. There is no excuse for him to try to win an argument with a paying customer (we spent over $900). With his actions he pretty much said, "we got these guys $900. Get 'em out so we can collect on this new group."</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<review>Some of the worst food I've ever tasted.  It was shocking.  The drinks actually were good, as was the service. The Buffalo Brass, the wings, and the hoecake were all bland.  The apple pie burger was... fine... I mean... Why?  For what purpose?  But it was edible.  The beignets and the bread pudding was not.  At least everything was expensive!  Never again...</review></record>

<text>Good food and drinks. Cool atmosphere and nice wait staff. A bit pricey but not too bad for Pasadena area and what they offer. My only issue is the music. Wayyyy too loud and doesn't fit the venue. Please play some Louisiana jazz or 40s crooner type music and for pete's sake, lower the volume so I can hear what my friends are saying!!</text>< pictures>

Happy hour has some good deals. The burger was very good and the bacon was the thickest sliced pieces I've ever seen, it was awesome. The decor seems very nice, but when I visited, the place had a very casual vibe, but then again, most of the patrons were on their way to a Metallica concert, so I'm not sure if that crowd is typical, but it was a good experience. There's a parking garage right next door with first 90 minutes free.</review>

The music did not match the sitting of the restaurant ... the food to salty, not enough salt, food not hot enough, brussel sprouts not cooked at all ... had to be taken back and removed from the bill</review>

Ambiance, drinks and customer service are all top notch. This is my fav watering hole in old Pas. Haven't eaten here yet, but the menu looks yummy. If you're looking for a cool speakeasy vibe with awesome tasty artisan cocktails, this is the spot.< /text>

We visit every year and have never been disappointed with the food and service at Parkway Grill. ALL their entrees are served well and tasty. We as a party of four had salmon or steaks and super. Do not miss it.</Review>

<Text>So craft drinks are nice and all... I appreciate the effort and time it takes. BUT... The problem with places like this is that when it gets busy these drinks take entirely way too long. An simple request for a beer turns into a 20mins wait while fruit is massaged, sage is burned, ice is sweated... Props to the idea but practicality wins in places that last more than a year</Text><Rating>3</Rating>< username>

One of my most favorite old fashioneds ever. Their brown bar is pretty extensive, and they have good happy hour prices. Parking can be easy if the adjacent structure is not full.< /Text>

What a wonderful surprise!! The White Horse Lounge is a great place for family, out of town guest spot, romantic two or just friends! The food is an explosion of flavors and mouth watering treats! I kind you not.. the southern fried chicken is seasoned to delight, the Hoe cake made me moooan, the salmon avec haricot verts satisfies the palate with lightness.. and the drinks..well let's just say they don't hold back! The ambiance is Nu Oleans almost classic brothel style with elegant private cubbies tucked aside; it's warm and welcoming and smooth music playing in the background will catch you for a recognizable song.. the service is exceptional, making sure you're delighted to be there. The chef is to be applauded..my understanding is he's been there about a year and a half and he's for sure making a statement at the White Horse Lounge! Oh and did I mention the Blackberry peach cobbler!! The place is high on my list you won't be disappointed!!< /text>

Worst place ever. No seating and you always need to  stand as it’s tiny place.  No one cares about you. I ordered fried chicken and beignets and it was so worst . Very bad preparation , taste and quality .. not sure how it got good reviews . I wouldn’t recommend< /Text>

Very cool bartenders and servers, and stiff drinks. Good happy hour prices, and they allowed us to host a large party there during a busy night.</Text>

Bah hipsters love over priced drinks and food. I don't get it. Ambience is nice and compliments the old town feel but seriously go to the dirty diver around the corner for an authentic Pasadena experience.< /review>

Drinks were good but service was terrible.  I saw servers walking around and no one approached us for over 10 minutes. We then walked up to the bar and were ignored for another 10 minutes</review>

Walking into Roys, I wasn't expecting much in the way of satisfaction to the palate. I visit Hawaii often and my overall impression has always been, that what the island lacks in sophistication as it relates to dining, is excused because of the location.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< userid>

<Review>Service was outstanding! Appetizers were all good, but the truffle fries were worth cheating on your diet. The hush puppies were really very plain falafel. Skip those until the chef figured out whether to make true southern hush puppies or actual falafel. The margarita and The Smartass were perfectly sweet. We'd definitely go back.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fun times at this bar. Specilalizing is WHISKEY. The bartender came directly to our table and asked about what we were looking for. Didnt have food.but the drinks and recommendations were great.  Vube was totally.fun. thankfully not a younger just learning how to drink atmosphere. Nice spot for the 30+ crowd. Cant wait to go again. Full bar< /text>

On an early Saturday morning we filled the place with our wedding party. Nice warm setting. Attentive servers. Food appropriate for 'tavern style'..ok and good portions. Drinks a bit pricy. (Ex. $10 for glass of house white wine) but if the mood is good maybe that's ok.<//Text>

<Review>Update:
We stopped by and has Arroyo hamburger which was fantastic. Big Josh, the chef stopped by and revealed that the every ingrediants used here is from a local and certified grower. We had Judy taken care of us.

Josh was proud of his cooking style learned from her Japanese granma.

A classy place with great selection and service. We just dropped in and got hooked.

We sat in and Cesar took our order. He suggested Strawberry Buck and Peach Schnapps to start with which were both sweet drinks and fit the occasion. Bertta, the manager stopped by and chatted with us over the specials for the night.

The Bread and Butter we got was warmly toasted with some  greens and slice of pork. We ordered Porklion and Arroyo Burger. Both were good and tasty. The portions were adequate.

We ended with Pear cobbler with scoop of ice cream. Well made and filling.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2c37131b91407:0x665921b8ebcce1a5</gmapID><Pics>None</Pics><user>115416100185945382737</user><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

<review>ordered the pesto sandwhich with truffle fries  it was righy on the money the pesto was fresh the chicken tender  the chibatta softer than other chibbattas I've had the 5 cheese Mac  was deliscious. I came to white horse because i saw their Mac and cheese  went on a date she orderd the steak and potatoes plate they are amazing cooks. Her potatoes were so rich in buttery flavor and a creamy thickness that people strive for when they claim they have the best in town.I want to disagree with who ever  didn't  like the food i want to try mor items from the menu the Georgia  smash was mixed well.< /review><Rating>4</Rating><Name>green guardian< /Name><pictures>None< /pictures>< Gmap_id>

<UserId.>111041826300691548984< /UserId.><Text>We came to White Horse Lounge in Pasadena to celebrate a friend's birthday.
Love the beautiful bar area. It’s got that classic American bar vibe.
Since we have a large party, we were seated in the private room in the back.
Very simple one page menu. They have quite a few small bites that are great with drinks.

Market Hummus | $10
House Lavash, EVOO, Fresh Garnish
We ordered a few appetizers to share.
Market Hummus was just ok. It lacked flavor.

Seared Brussel Sprouts | $10
Smoked Tomatoes, Basil, Parmesan
Seared Brussel Sprouts was great. We enjoyed the addition of tomatoes and basil.

Garlic Truffle Fries | $9
Truffle Oil, Parmesan, Gremolata
We love the Garlic Truffle Fries. Thick and crunchy fries seasoned with truffle oil and cheese.

Bone-In New York 22 oz | $45
For steak orders, guests can pick 2 sides and a sauce for the meat.
A friend ordered the huge Bone-In New York, and she almost finished it!
She likes the steak, but didn’t like the cajun butter sauce.

Ribeye 16 oz | $35
Dr. P and I both ordered the Ribeye.
The steak was cooked perfectly. Very delicious.
For sides, I got the twice baked potato and corn succotash.
I enjoyed both. And the horseradish sauce was great with the steak.

The Black Sea | $25
Squid Ink Tagliolini, Dinapoli Tomato, Calamari, Prawn, Finés Herbes
A few people ordered The Black Sea – the squid ink seafood pasta.
Everyone said it was way too salty, and nobody liked it.

I like that we had the private room, and could be as loud as we want.
Service could be better. Our waitress didn’t check on us often.
We had to go out to find her a few times.
It was a really fun night with friends.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<text>Great ambiance and good appetizers. Pretty disappointing on entrees.

Crispy Shrimp - delicious, small portion
Ahi Poke Tower - good; crunchy, sauce tastes like teriyaki instead of ponzu, small portion
Garlic Truffle Fries - good, decent portion

Besto Pesto - okay; too much sauce, falls apart easily
The Regal - bad; steak is tender, salty sauce, not worth the price
The Black Sea - okay, handmade pasta is too thin, sauce could be better, not worth the price

Beignet - delicious, warm donuts that go well with chocolate-hazelnut sauce
Chocolate mousse cake - okay, very heavy chocolate taste< /text>< pictures>

<Text>I was there few nights ago to try their new menu items. I tried two different types of kale salad, stuffed mushrooms, mashed potato, turmeric rice, buffalo brass, filet mignon, creme brulee and fried twinkie with ice cream. I'm pretty satisfied. The service was great, the food was good, my favorite was filet mignon and buffalo brass, which is fried cauliflower in buffalo sauce. When I saw it on the table, it looks just like chicken wings but it's cauliflower. Mashed potato wasn't my favorite, it didn't have much flavor but that means it's healthy. Everything was pretty healthy yet tasty.< /Text>< pictures>

< review>
Holy Moly!!! One of the best bars in the universe! Between bartender Brett's "Angry Squirter" drink - a spritzy, lemony orange, refreshing yet sensual concoction,....to bartender Brian's "Burnt Orange" drink - a Rye, charred orange, bitters, & in house made grenadine, the White House Lounge had something for everyone. The beautiful curly birch bar that was imported from 1908 old town Chicago is a must see! Other drinks to try are the Punch 41 & the Smartass. Not to mention the guiness reduction & cabernet reduction are amazing...good enough for pancake syrup!  :p. LOVE THESE GUYS. Can't wait to come back!

<rating>4< /rating><text>(Translated by Google) I ordered a Salmon dish, and since I'm allergic to cucus and quinoa, I told them, and they brought me the Salmon dish but honestly, it was not delicious, it was simple without flavor without salt without seasoning, my husband ordered the same dish of Salmon and He told me that the dish was excellent and juicy. Some restaurants should think about these situations so that everyone can enjoy their delicacies. Thanks to Ehite Horse restaurant.
