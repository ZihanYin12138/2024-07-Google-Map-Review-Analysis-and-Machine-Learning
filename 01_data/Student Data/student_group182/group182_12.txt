Highly recommend! While on a road trip halfway across the country, I had a clanging noise coming from my tire that was driving me crazy. Turned out there was a rock that had somehow lodged itself inside of my brake rotor. They were able to help remove it and get me back on the road. Thanks for the great service!<//Review>

They called at closing time and said that the brakes were fine and the fluids looked good. It must be an electrical problem. I got home and removed the back wheel to see that the brakes were never touched (no marks on the rust). I opened the Master cylinder and was shocked to see black sludge about 1/4 inch thick. Took to another place and was told that my brakes were leaking and there was air getting into the lines and the pads and drums are shot. They didn't even check and sent me on my way with faulty brakes so that they could close early on a Saturday. Thanks for nothing Sam.< /text>< UserId.>

Had a tire kept going flat even w/stop leak. Stopped after work, they were super nice, covid safe wearing masks at all times and outdoor wait area. Didn't take long and very light on my wallet. I'll be getting an oil change here in the future 😊<//Text>

Sam and Eric are Automotive Rock-stars.  Billy is an amazing wrench-guy, and I trust them with the safety of my family as "my mechanics." This is the place you can send your family and friends with confidence.  Been going there for years, and they continue to earn my trust.< /Review>

The light work was not done at all, as we soon discovered. In fact, the old sealant around the bulbs was still intact. A request for a refund was met with a demand that we call the corporate office, and we will. I see very mixed reviews for this business. Seems to be hit or miss. As for us, once was enough.<//Review></record>

Was recieved by the most positive person ever! Super great and fast service. I went in because my tire popped on the freeway and needed a new one asap. The gentleman at the countee recognized that I was very upset and reminded me how things could have been much worse. Great customer service! I think I found my new tire shop 😊</Review>

Got 4 tire on my tiny car for 209 out the door. Not bad. They're brand name too, dural. They were polite and informative and service was delivered in a timely manner with no issues. They also answerer the phone and had excellent communication. Highly recommended. They have high end stuff too and I'm assuming they have the best deal in town.</review>

Initially it seemed like we had a good experience. They seemed to be friendly to my wife and would  take her home to help her out when needing a ride; however, she was supposed to get a free oil change and they told her that her car, which is simply a minivan, could not take the regular oil, and she got charged $38... so basically instead of getting a free oil change she paid about full price, which I believe was simply automotive men taking advantage of a woman. Then I asked for a quote for my brakes which was higher than my normal place that I do business and the gentleman at good guys said I should check the parts that they are using from my mechanic because they could be $10 brake pads. Wow. Really? How about you are just more expensive without you having to put down my mechanic or accuse him of using bad parts. Needless to say, we we will not be going back to this place of business. Oh yeah, we also checked the owners manual, the van takes the basic oil that you can get at Walmart for $3 a quart. So much for Automotive Experts. Like I said, they were simply taking advantage of a woman. Very sad!</Text>

Our AC compressor died in Sequoia National Park, and our warranty service referred us to Good Guys. We had a very good experience. The work was done within one day, on a Saturday, and was even finished early. The cost was also a bit less than we paid back home in the Midwest for a simiar repair.

The A/C is running well and we were back on our vacation with minimal disruption. George was very good communicating with us throughout the process.</Review>

Super Customer Service - Have used them since I moved to Visalia.  Very friendly and have used their services to shuttle me when car is being serviced.  Due to the weather here, tire pressure changes frequently and Good Guys have always taken the time to fill without any appointment on the spot.  Specifically, George has been super kind.  Highly recommend.< /text>

These people literally suck. I had a simple oil change and this guys says I have 1500 dollars of work to do compared to another mechanic of 1000. So over priced for one. Very rude customer service and do not know how to talk to people what so ever. And I feel that they did something to my headlights because my headlights were working perfectly fine before I went in and after I picked my car up only my day lights would turn on. Not even asking to check or fix the problem. Sam is one of the guys names and he was very rude.</review>

They persuaded us into purchasing four new tires, which was fine, but after saying yes they proceeded to tell us they only had three of the tires and would notify us when the fourth tire comes in.  They also told us that there were "other things" that our vehicle needed work on, which was not true.  When they called us to go in for the fourth tire it was a week later AND George was extremely rude.  I do not recommend this place at all!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I work the week,  so I called to ask if they could get to my car today, and was told to “bring it in”...  After it sat there all day I was told they would get to it on Monday, 5 minutes before they closed on Saturday.  It took them 3 days to replace two radiator hoses and was way over priced.  When I showed up to get my car, they surprised me by fixing something that they did not ask my permission about, nor did they call me to tell me about it.  For all I know they could have had an old part lying around and just said they fixed it, and showed me the part...  Customer service was a little rude as well.< /text>< Pictures>

Was in the area and brought in our daughter's vehicle for tires and brakes.  They were honest, fair, efficient and comprehensive in analyzing and completing the work that was required to keep her and the grandkids safe on the road.  Thanks to Sam for his customer service.<//Review>

Long story short: I brought in my vehicle to get the air conditioning fixed. They charged me an arm and a leg for Freon, labor, and they said they would check for leaks. AC worked for one day. Brought it back in the following week and they said "Oh, here's the leak where the filter is." "So we'll charge you again for more Freon." No thank you! $300 spent and I'm still riding in 105 degree heat with no AC. NEVER AGAIN!< /Review>

Used to go to them for repairs but they weren't willing to help us anymore.  After spending over a thousand dollars here on personal and company vehicles, they were unable to service our vehicles.< /Text>

If someone is looking for a school to go to this is your best option. All the teachers are awesome and are always willing to help you, even if you don't like the subject they teach. At the end, part of me was happy to leave, but the other wanted to stay. It is a great place.</Text>< pics>

All they have to do is put the right pallets on the right trailer and create a bill of lading, and somehow that’s too difficult. Worrying about how a driver does his job but can’t manage to do their own. Clowns.<//Review>

<Date>1623163416249</Date><text>This was actually the best hair cut I’ve ever received. I am finally getting close to the shape I want. I was in and out in 30 minutes! I’m usually in the salon for a minimum of 4 hours. Sometimes up to 7 or 8. We cut down the time so much by not walking my hair, but I came in clean and my hair looked great, so it wasn’t necessary. I was grateful I could leave a tip on my credit card and they seemed encouraged!

The receptionist and my stylist were so friendly.

It was cute inside. Only downsides are it’s a little hard to park and there is construction at the front door right now.< /text>< resp>

Days later from my visit I still feel like I’m on the clouds. I had such a great experience at Lulus with stylist Charlene. I’m not use to my natural hair I had some pretty damaged hair and opt for a big chop and I can’t stop looking at myself. I’m so happy to be falling in love with my natural self. I can’t wait to come back. The salon was impeccably clean, organized, super cute and my favorite place was the hair dryers. I was so pleased with the salon I went to read more about its history and to see the photos of the owner building the salon from scratch made it all the more special to have spent my money with I Love Lulu I have already told my mother, sister and have plans to bring my daughter if they are open to styling children’s hair. Thank you. So very pleased with my visit.<//text>

Great salon! My stylist (Charlene) started on my hair as soon as I arrived; I didn't have to wait! This salon promotes healthy hair and my stylist thoroughly explained to me what my hair needs and how to achieve results. I will definitely go back! Oh, and it's very COVID-safe. Everyone was wearing a mask.<//text>

I absolutely enjoyed my experience at I love Lulu Hair Spa Saturday, April 15, 2021. I recently moved to Studio City March 2021, and I couldn't wait to get back to a good regimen for my hair. I found this gem online. After watching a Youtube video of Lulu and her sister, reading the reviews, and viewing the website -  I got excited. I like how Lulu is from North Carolina and just really intune to hair and making people feel good about their hair. Her sister was icing on the cake when stated she wants you to come in feeling one way and leaving feeling totally different in a good way. I definitely felt my hair/scalp was fully nurtured. I have a lot going on with my hair - breakage, thinning and just a need of some really good products to get me back on track. I am excited to see what my hair will feel and look like in about 4 months. The whole vibe of the decor, cleanliness, professionalism, and the comfort was pluses for me. The only One thing I didn't like - you see a different stylist each time you book an appointment unless you pay $25 add'l to the service amounts for a request. I don't understand why. I did ask and the answer I received, it's a better workflow and we all use the same products. I still can't wrap my brain around it and I like the idea of seeing the same person. I do understand each stylist uses the same product and nothing would be different other than a cut, color, or certain style. But none of that deter me from wanting to come back. The good definitely outweighs that one dislike. I have my next appointment in two weeks, so we shall see. Wish me success!</Text>

Nice place recommended by another customer that this is THE PLACE for all your natural hair experience must go hair salon.

I' uploaded the pictures and you'll be the best judge -  I went with the intention of just washing it - though in the back of my mind into chopping down my hair - DISCLAIMER  I've never ever seen my natural hair since I was 11-12 years old. From that time on it's been relaxed! Touch-up! Etc.

So with that being said, I went as a Walk-in and I was taken care of within the period on an hour and a half. Not bad given the fact I had no appointment.

It seems that my hair grows upward - got a crown 👑  rocking lol! The best and the worth cost of doing the natural hairstyle is that I felt my hair FINALLY soft. Phew!!!</Text>

Cool spot! My niece treated me to a steam treatment and I dug it! Nice place, helpful staff....clean and fast service. The website is janky so if you like it...get your Shelly Jelly while you are there in person as any order over 4 items freaks their system out. Beware of requesting specific stylists as it will cost you! Overall,  I had a blast. They offer fancy water and tea along with t-shirts for sale and many natural-hair-focused products and accessories.  I will go back!< /text>

I did not have to wait long for my service (simple cut). Friendly, helpful and informative staff. They did exactly what I wanted and did not cut off more than necessary. Reasonably priced. (I've been grossly overcharged before at a salon.) I was never sat under a dryer. Though those services were OFFERED, they were not imposed. Very comfortable seating. Hanger for my purse at my chair. Clean. Quiet and peaceful at the time I visited. It is so difficult for me to find someone to handle my curls naturally and not require me to get my hair pressed or blow dried to get a proper cut. I was more than pleased. Very pleasant experience!< /text>< pics>

<Review>Very refreshing. The hair stylist/carer immediately knew that my hair didn't lock in moisture. She suggested some great products for hair care. So far, so good.

UPDATE: The products in my hair did not go well.  The mix of the gel and the curl custard (forgot what it's called) leave residue on my hair.  IT took a couple washes to remove.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

The place is beautiful but the staff and their communication is sub par. This was my first time here and I was told I would get a hair consultation. Didn’t happen. The girl started doing  my hair and wetting it. After I told them I had not been in a hair salon in years and I needed to be guided about what would be best for my hair. The girl didn’t know what would be best. She just started up selling steam treatments and when asked why would that be good for my hair specifically, she couldn’t really tell me.  Was never told that this was a WET bar. The product they used left white flakes in my hair. When I was done with the hair dryer I sat in the chair for five minutes. I had to go to the receptionist to fetch my hair dresser. I left with a wet Afro. No style in my hair at ALL. I really wanted to make this my home salon, but it just is not a dope salon. The girl who worked on my hair didn’t give me any tips for my hair or how my hair can be improved. I had to constantly ask about the health of my hair. Never going back  and I advise you to save money and take your business elsewhere. Sadly, I don’t see this salon around for very long.< /review>

This was a fantastic and awesome experience. This was my 1st time at the salon.
I was blown away by the kitchen when I walked in.  It is used to create concoctions for hair.  It is very modern.  The atmosphere was warm and inviting.  Charlene, my stylist took very good care of me taking time to explain the the theraputic hair cocktails and recommended the most appropriate one for me.  My favorite part was sitting under the steamer.  I was out in under two hours with defined locks and pillowy soft hair.< /Text>

Very modern, trendy, clean facility. 1 star due to their product leaving white flakes all over my two stand twist out, even after I asked if their product, once it dried, would leave white flakes residue and was told it wouldn't. Not cool at all! For $100+ price tag, I expect better.< /review>

I enjoy the fact that Bebe's kids aren't running around like most black salons, the tea, the extremely comfortable shampoo chairs and the hair steam treatment. I don't enjoy the prices. I do appreciate quality but I don't like feeling like I'm being nickel and dimed for everything. It blows my mind that a blow dry is not a part of the process. By the time you finish the steam treatment and ask for a blow dry (not even straight hair blow out...just to dry it) expect to spend at least $80 not including the tip. That's a bit much. Truthfully you're better off just going to Sally's and buying a steamer for your home use. I'd recommend the products at LuLus but not the services. I too was informed after the consultation that I never got about the wet bar situation. Not cool. I tried to get a phone consultation. Even offered to prepay and include it in the service because I couldn't physically make it in. The receptionist said that wasn't possible. I asked if I could come in and just show a stylist my hair. That too wasn't possible. Just say "We charge for you to leave here with a dry head" Lulu a wet bar is the the bar in the middle of the pool that you swim up to on vacation. There's one stylist there petite pretty and quick(I don't remember her name) but I left with damage from her quickness and ripping through my hair. I was excited to find Lulu but this is an average service salon at best. Products are amazing. Service is 😑<//text>

If I could give negative stars I would. I was sooo excited and ready to fall in love with this place.  I thought I found my new salon home. Organic Black Hair Salon,  so LA, so amazing,  like finding a needle in a haystack!

All the ambiance and organic products don't mean anything if you can't/don't thoroughly communicate your services to a new client.

For one,  it should be called a "wet bar" since ALL the employees are too oblivious to communicate to NEW clients that if you want your hair dried, that they have to factor in time for that in your appointment.

And if they're about to close, they will have you walk out with a fully wet head [even though you communicate repeatedly YOU would NEVER do that] bc they can't be bothered to dry your hair bc they want to go home. REALLLY?!

You don't think it's IMPORTANT to communicate that to a brand new client who asked for a consultation BEFORE you wet their massive thick head of hair [they told you they always wear their hair straight]?!?!

And then there's 30 minutes left until "closing time"& you'd rather argue with the client over a technicality, instead of righting the wrong.  And then the manager comes in and commences to argue with me about how I can leave with a wet head and come back another day at their convenience.  So now instead of wasting 30 minutes of my time,  you've now wasted OVER an hour about how you "can't".

In the hour they spent arguing with me,  thru could've been drying my hair!

Sadly,  this is one of the reasons why so many black owned businesses do not thrive.  As a business owner, don't argue with a customer.  Take full accountability for YOUR STAFF being UNCLEAR,  by not communicating to a new customer how their salon works.  It's YOUR responsibility to 'dummy proof' any new client to properly manage expectations.  YOU give the client ALL of the information they need so they can make  FULLY INFORMED decision prior to receiving services.  Don't refer to your staff's LACK of communication as "client/staff 'miscommunication'". And right the wrong at the client's convenience, not yours.

I shell out tons of money for my hair, I shouldn't have to argue to pay someone to finish doing my damn hair.

I was ready to arrange a whole day with me and my gfs to go and have the place to ourselves. Instead,  I'm writing a review after driving home,  pissed and staying up 2 hours untangling, drying,  and straightening my own hair. #Wasteoftime< /text>

I Hate Lulu's
I went in to get a root coloring (greys); A trim and deep conditioning. First off, on a positive note, it's a lovely atmosphere. Clean facility and soothing music. BUT IT ENDS THERE
I was met by a cosmetology STUDENT who informed me that she was still working on her HOURS (!!???) I regret stopping services not because she wasn't African American BUT because she told me that she was a "work in progress"...SMH--Who wants a work in progress working on their head? I mean these are a la carte  salon prices. $65 for root coloring; $60 for cut; $35 for deep conditioning (which consists of olive oil added to conditioner and being place under a "steam machine"; $15 dollars for a blow dry (if you don't want your hair cut wet) $175 in total.
After the student colored my hair and conditioned my hair. The other services were performed by another young lady--who did the blow dry and cut (cut was not "precision" as advertised). It infuriates me that the second young lady in my head failed to inform me that the grays (that she watched the student cover) were still very visible.
I left looking like I just wasted my money; Got home to have braids put in and was told that I had a head full of grays. I called and immediately returned to the shop to ask that the money I spent for the color be returned. THIS IS WHERE I MET THE OWNER LULU.
When got there, a member of the staff went through my hair to confirm that my grays were not covered. The owner (Lulu) approached me, refused to give me back my money. I mean this woman had a smug (I'm the owner) attitude, literally making up excuses for her student worker ("I give people chances") and telling me her (coloring) product was made with natural ingredients--therefore "it doesn't always take on the first try".  After making it clear that my money would not be refunded, Lulu told me to come back and that she would do my hair HERSELF..."Please give me a chance to make it right" she says. Went back two days later, she colored my hair--this time placing me under a dryer with the color on (something the student skipped the first time). I left feeling less robbed than the first time but now that I washed my hair (first time since it got done) no color.

If you want to waste your money on procedures that you can do at home? Go to Lulu's. Otherwise, take heed.< /text>

Jijime is one of our favorite restaurants in San Francisco. The ramen is exquisite, boneless chicken (honey butter) to die for, wide selection of good beers, amazing service, mellow atmosphere (they often play bossa nova in the restaurant, it's awesome), all perfect. I can’t imagine a better way to spend a rainy weeknight then cozying up with a warm Tonkotsu ramen from Jijime. The most solid of choices for a casual night out for dinner.< /Review>

<Text>Staff was attentive and checked on us often. They have a nice variety from fried items (super flavorful) and noodle soup (perfect for the kids). I wasn’t a huge fan of the quesadilla though but that’s just me.

Wow great food! I don't miss the Japanese place that was here before at all. My friend and I ordered a bunch of stuff. Only no as good thing was there salmon ceviche, too much lemon/tartness... Fried chicken, ssam, corn cheese, fried squid, very delicious. Great service too.</Review>

<Time>1587342042589</Time><text>I really wanted to try this place since I saw their great deals for sake. Inside is really cute and clean. It is a bit small, but not crowded. We were seated immediately.

We ordered the short ribs, okonomiyaki fries, two beef bibimbap, and the chicken jjim. Of all the dishes, the chicken jjim was our favorite. The chicken and noodles were super tasty. The sauce went well with the bibimbap. I loved the fries and would highly recommend those for an appetizer. The short ribs were a great deal too. I think one downside was that there were no sides/banchan, but that's okay!

I loved this place and definitely plan to visit again soon. They have a great happy hour discount on sake. Their menu is pretty extensive and have a great selection of small plates. They're also doing take out for quarantine!</text>< Name>

<text>First of all, I was unhappy that I couldn’t make reservations, and the paper sign-in sheet at the establishment is inefficient. There is no room to stand, as the facility is small, so we had to wait outside, but then we didn’t receive notification that a table was available, so we had to ask again for one. After ordering, it took a while for the food to arrive, likely due to the small number of staff. The food itself was underwhelming, as it did not have much flavour without the sauce. The place is attractive and has a nice atmosphere, but overall, my expectations were not met.</text>< Pics>

It's been awhile since I gave a 5 star review but this little hidden gem sure deserved it. I saw this fairly new place a week ago while running errands and stopped by for lunch with a friend today.
Since the menu classified the starters as tapas, we were going to order a few and then share a ramen or a sizzling bibimbab. The tapas were large in portions and we couldn't even finish the 4 we order. We thought we were done till they brought out the dessert menu.

Seafood Jeon $6.50
Korean savory pancake with mixed seafood
5* This was one of the best dishes, 2 small pancakes perfectly cooked. Crispy and tender at the same time.

Boneless Fried Chicken (spicy or soy garlic) $7.50
Bite size Korean style crispy boneless chicken with your choice of flavor
5* Another hit, chicken was cooked to perfection and the sauce was perfectly seasoned.

Popcorn Salmon $6
Bite size fried salmon with spicy
4* The salmon was just slightly overcooked for my liking but still divine.

Corn Cheese $6
Corn with creamy sauce and cheese on sizzling pan
3* This was average, nothing spectacular. Next time we will order the slicked beef salad instead.

I forgot to take a picture of the dessert, the Mango Panna Cotta was definetly a nice touch to end a delicious meal. I gave this restaurant 5 stars because the waitstaff was excellent. Great service with a smile!< /Text>

Impressive Korean and Asian foods. The price is not so high and the foods offered are very much worthy. Good for heavy meals as well as snack items. Drinks were also impressive, looks very delicious for its smell and colors. I am gonna make more visits here.< /Review>

Spicy pork 👌 Fast service, and clean!  The spicy pork bowl was excellent.  I will try ramen next. I'm sure it's also great. Great Korean menu, spicy of course.  I highly recommend Jijime!<//text>

<Review>My husband and I came in here after just walking around the area looking for someplace to eat. first we visited Bluefin to only find out that they open at 5 p.m. so that was a bummer, then we went to Gordo's and discovered that they only had meat for their burritos so that was a no-go. (We are pescatarian-vegan.)
Then we happen to walk across the street from Gordo's just a few feet from the stop light, and stumbled onto Jijime.

What really grabbed us was the happy hour! visit their Instagram for pics of their food!!!! Tell me to my face that food dont look good, and ill tell you, you a muhfuh lie😂!!!!!!
the happy hour menu, I mean just for the sake and the beer alone I was in static shock. Then we looked at their tapas menu; It was everything we could ask for!
I mean everything we were able to have, delicious sake wine beer cocktails and small-plates that my husband and I were able to share at a very very very reasonable rate.

My husband and I are native San Franciscans! this is what we live for, in our city, to find those hidden gems and this is a city hidden Gem. If you want some happy hour eats from 3 to 6 p.m. please come here and see Hannah shout out to you Hannah because you were very sweet and you served us very well and we were very pleased, you, the cooks, and the food are the reason we are coming back!
PSA: to the vegans of San Francisco. Look no more they have a vegan and vegetarian option for their bebambib 😱. Your Welcome 😏.
Now I am going to show you below a before pic and there is no after pic because, in the words of my husband,

"WE TOOK THAT DOWN!!!"

And shout out to the cooks! They threw down! I feel so good after eating their food. The freshness! The ambiance. It was cozy and modern and quaint! Definitely will become a regular!!!!
See Ya'll Soon!!!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBzyjlbwITIn3LQwG3CZjKFd_k0L9-LBnW901s=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

Maybe I shouldn't get a ramen at a Korean fusion place? The broth and ramen are good, although nothing spectacular. But the pork is dry and plain. This is the only dish I got, therefore three stars. Fast service.<//text>

Jijime's Korean - Asian fusion - Ramen flavors and textures are not for me. The Black Garlic Ramen $12.99 was sandy/gritty from the black garlic. It felt like I was eating bits of charcoal in most of my bites. It was bitter and off-putting for me. I thought I would like it because I enjoy garlic and black garlic and lots of reviews mentioned liking the dish.

I didn't like the flavor of the crispy fried seaweed roll. The spicy boneless chicken was soggy. The popcorn potstickers were okay.<//review>

Sizzling Bibimbap ingredients were very underwhelming. Big slices of lettuce and bell peppers. Tryout plates/bowls options instead. Had the ramen with housemade garlic oil. Broth was good. The ramen is comparable to ramen used in instant ramen. Underwhelming.<//Text>

Very good and reliably made Korean food: we had the fried rice and the Kimchi stew. The Kimchi stew was a bit salty, but not bad overall. The fried rice was very good. Great vibe, good music, quite popular (the restaurant was well booked for our evening of eating).</review>

<rate>3< /rate><review>The concept is excellent. I’ve always wished I could get small plates of Korean food. And even the flavors here are great. The problem is it tastes like too many dishes are pre-made rather than freshly made. So, fried things aren’t crispy enough, the pancake was a bit soggy and not hot enough. And I could see the guy behind the bar microwaving things. I’d love to see them modify their food prep so I could enjoy this place and give it a better rating.</review>< Pictures>

Kind of dark inside, with trendy decor. Good selection of beer. Waiter was super sweet and pretty attentive despite being the only server. Kimchi is very tasty but quite spicy, can't beat the price at $1.<//Text>< Pictures>

Stopped in after seeing a recommendation from a friend and plenty of good reviews on here. I wanted to try the katsu-don but when I asked the waitress about it she said they could not make it that evening...so I decided to order the bulgogi bowl and some okonomiyaki fries.

I didn't expect the okonomiyaki fries ($6) to be good but actually they were excellent. The fries had a McDonald's like texture but gourmet with kewpie mayo and katsu sauce finished with bonito flakes on top. Excellent.

Then the bulgogi bowl ($12.95) appeared. This bowl was a sad bulgogi bowl with disappointing small slices of meat that tasted like every Korean AYCE BBQ place I've ever been to. There was tons of green salad (with no dressing) and rice that filled the whole bowl probably at least 80% of the bowl with some clear noodles.

I would much rather pay more and have good bulgogi than pay less and have a disappointing experience. The bulgogi marinade was also super sweet, acid reflux inducing...overall just not good. I would not order it again.

The ambiance is nice here and its a good place to go with friends and maybe order some tapas, but if you really love Korean food you might find yourself disappointed at Jijime.<//review>

<text>I have never seen a "soft opening" that was so smooth and excellent as Jijime's - they got everything right from the get-go:

- A varied menu, authentically Korean but fitting every possible palate
- Low prices, $5 for "Small Bites" (which are really fun), $10-14 for (big) entrées
- The place looks both elegant and homey, lighting, decor first-class, the music is set right, providing background, not interfering with conversations
- Service is exceptional, both genuinely friendly and responding to every need

In just a week, Jijime became a habit.

The only "however" is that this is not the kind of Korean restaurant where you get a dozen small dishes to start with. For that, go to Han Il Kwan, two blocks away from Jijime, at 19th and Balboa.</text><Response>None< /Response></record>

Quaint little campgrounds.  Close to town for supplies. Pretty quiet during the week  but weekends can get busy. Vault toilets  dumpsters and there is water at half of the sites. Trees along the river act as a windbreak. Not all sites have shade. There are picnic tables and fire ring or BBQ stands at each site. The river drowns out most noises.  Dogs okay on a  leash. No on-site  host but someone comes by everyday to check the bathrooms and trash.< /review>

Cool campground. There are restrooms and drinking water, fire rings and seating places provided, no shower. We have seen, that the gast station close by hast showers to use, we haven't tried them. There is a small river flowing through the campground, awesome for a refreshing shower, but cold ;)
14$ per campground. Awesome view surrounds the campground.</text>

Very little shade. Tons of broken glass throughout the campground. Has 2 nice creeks and a couple of trails but no info posted about them. There is water and pit toilets available.</Text>

Easy to get to, beautiful views, good fishing. Hot in the summer, and the venting from the bathroom smelled very bad. Inside the bathrooms didn't smell, just outside. But otherwise I definitely recommend this place. If you have a large motorhome or trailer, highly recommend choosing sites west of the first bathroom, they are larger and easier to park in.<//review>

Beautiful little campground. Nice and clean. There is a little Creek running through it as you may have surmised by the name.. However it is not for large RV'S. Fortunately there weren't many campers and we could maneuver around the loop. There was one spot large enough for us, but since it's a one way in and one way out campground, it could have been tricky had it been more crowded. The view is absolutely gorgeous. I highly recommend this campground.< /review>

<Review>Beautiful little campground  nice and clean. Loved the little Creek running through. However it is not for large RV'S. Fortunately there weren't many campers and we could maneuver around the loop. There was one spot large enough for us (34 foot rv and 20 foot trailer)  but since it's a one way in and out campground it could have been tricky had it been more crowded. View is gorgeous</Review><Gmap_id>0x80bfbe0a6944af03:0xec4be88a0149785d<//Gmap_id><time>1457105339464<//time>< Pictures>

We stayed at the campground with our camper (24 foot) for 1 night. A very relaxed place to be. At the north side a very very beautiful view incl. the Sierra Nevada. A nice creek was just flowing trough the campsite. Also nice places for tents. Quiet a lot of shade caused by the big trees and some sunny places as well. There was a neat toilet also.
We enjoyed the place vey much.
We were there Oktober 2nd 2015.

Her professionalism and thorough examination, gives me great confidence every time I go to her. One of her greatest attribute is that she really listens and documents what you’ve said about your eyes any challenges or difficulties that you’ve had in the past year. She also takes a great deal of care and understanding your about professional and personal wants/wishes for contacts or stylish, professional eyeglasses...let me rephrase that fashionable eyeglasses.

Over the past three years I’ve had two different insurance companies, and she has taken both of those insurance for my examination as well as my lenses.< /review>< resp>

It’s hard to find an optometrist who takes time with patients these days, but Dr. Hopkins is fantastic. She helped me find a new contact lens that stays put (I have an astigmatism). The staff is also great. Very cordial and helpful. Offices were super clean before the pandemic and of course are super clean and sanitized between every patient now.< /Text>

Posted closing hours misleading!!!  I called at 5:30pm letting them know I'm on my way to pick up my contacts and will be there 5:45pm.  Receptionist told me they're done with their last patient and are closing, even though, their posted hours state they close at 6pm on Tuesday.  What's the point of your posted hours if you're going to close after your last patient anyway!?  I'm glad I called and didn't drive there for nothing!!!  I'm am really upset they were not willing to stay open for me to pick up my contacts!  Shows how much they care and value their returning patients!!!< /text>

Lauren is very knowledgeable and explained my insurance and I knew exactly what my copay was. Jim is he Optician and he helped me pick out the greatest pair of glasses for every day use and my sunglasses too. Thank you Jim. Before seeing the doctor I had a preliminary test done and Elina was great and very patient with me. Thank you Dr Hopkins you and your staff are great! I will recommend my friends and family.< /text>

Dr Hopkins has been my Optometrist for almost 20 years.  She is pleasant and professional.  Glaucoma runs in my family and she checks for that along with other eye issues to keep my vision sharp.

I am in good hands with her and wouldnt go to anyone else with my sight.  Im an accountant so if I cant see I cant work - I trust her with one of my most valuable assets!  Thanks Dr Hopkins!</text>

I am a new patient and met with Dr. Elson. Great experience and his recommendation was spot on. The office staff are very kind, thoughtful and helpful.
I have already recommended this office and will be bringing my kids here.< /review>

Great Dr. with excellent office staff!  Our whole family now goes to Dr Hopkins, and we've all referred others. It is hard not to when everything is so positive: smart & kind Dr who is up on all the best technology, with a staff who makes everything flow smoothly. I know it can be hard to get both together, which is why we appreciate it so much.< /Review>

This is a great place to go for all your Optometry needs. The staff are helpful and really go above and beyond. They even readjust my frames for free whenever I need a hand. Very professional and they have state of the art equipment. I highly recommend. Even though I moved a bit further away I still go to them rather than finding someone new.<//text>

I've been with Lisa for decades, but this review concerns my recent experience with her optician when I went in to get a new pair of glasses with the same RX as the ones I recently lost. I gave him the max # of stars available on the e-mail form (and above) and the one word "Outstanding." He was thorough, friendly but very professional, and very helpful with my selection of frames for the glasses.< /Review>

<Date>1584540943462< /Date><review>I went to Dr Hopkins for the first time and she is amazing and Jim fixed my old glasses perfect. I was upset when I picked up my glasses and notice before I even put them on were damaged. I remember the receptionist put the glasses that I picked out to the side. I thought those were samples and they would order a new pair. Lady try to adjust my glasses and didn't do a good job and are slipping on my nose and tight on one side and when I left wasn't given a case for my glasses and had to go back to bemind them. Can hardly wait for jim to fix my glasses.  This is Unexcepable service for glasses and being billed close to 860 for glasses.<//review>< user>

I have been seeing (no pun intended :-) ) Dr. Hopkins for many years now.  She is caring, thorough, and professional.  She keeps up with the latest products, eyeglass frame trends, and equipment.  In addition she is also involved in our community groups and always willing to lend a hand for our neighborhood events.  Dr. Lisa Hopkins is not only an excellent optometrist but an asset to our community as well.  I highly recommend her for all your eye care needs!<//review>

State of the art equipment, scheduling and reminders. Friendly and efficient staff. Not much waiting around when you come to your appointment.

Dr. Hopkins is very professional, thorough and yet personable, explaining tests, your results, and your options patiently to the level of detail you need and ask for. My wife and I have been patients for years, and enjoy going there for our exams. Only need off-the shelf readers, so no pressure from the staff to buy any glasses.

Highly recommend Dr. Hopkins' office and to pay the extra out-of-pocket (insurance doesn't cover it yet) for the no-dilation exam - when you are done, you walk out and are ready for the day. Nice remodeling of the offices, can't wait to see it finished.   :O)<//Review>

Dr. Lisa Hopkins is the best Optometrist I've ever had.  She is very professional, she is technically superior to other Optometrists I've been to, she goes the extra mile for her patients, and she has all the best name brand frames available.  Her staff is helpful and friendly as well.  Her office is also well appointed.  Going to Dr. Lisa Hopkins' Office is a top end experience.< /Text>

Lisa Hopkins has the most beautiful frames around.  I get comments all the time about how great my glasses are and I send them down to Lisa's shop in Naples.  Also the people who help you find the perfect glasses are both friendly and very professional.  They know all about checking your insurance, they know much more than I do and always volunteer to help.< /review>

Very professional and thorough eye examination.  Prescription for glasses hit the mark exactly; the glasses she prescribed work well for me in distance, in mid-range (computer), and reading.  I have been going to Dr. Hopkins for many years now, and results are always the best.</Text>

She uses all the latest equipment and clearly is current in her medical reading, as she is always aware of what is new in eye disease.  I worry about macular degeneration, and she always remembers and tests me for it. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Hopkins, she's great.  Also, she is always on time, so you need to be too.<//Review>< pics>

My wife and I have been patients of Dr. Hopkins since she first opened her practice on 2nd Street. We have always been completely satisfied with every aspect of her business. All of the staff handle their duties very professionally. Her selection of frames is great - something for everyone. We do not hesitate to recommend her to our friends.

<text>Dr. Hopkins is an absolutely superb Doctor.  She took care of my difficult eye issues for several years before I moved to the East Coast.  I only wish she was here!  She is caring, thorough and really goes the extra mile in her care for her patients.  I can't recommend her more.  You simply will not find anyone better - this is the truth.<//text></record></dataset><record>

<review>WOW. Can’t believe the negative comments i’m seeing. This place gets busy, so if you go in and no one “smiles” at you try to understand that they are busy taking care of their customers! I love this place, my best friends and I go here a lot. I even got my husband hooked on this place. Very clean and friendly, and the burger and fries are my favorite!!!</review><gmapID>0x8091066af0f7ec99:0x36b248cfa07143d</gmapID><username>nika jenizeh</username><user>106286347975859619017<//user>< Date>

I love their ice cream floats. It makes me like everything in the world is going to be alright when I am sitting in a booth and there is an ice cream float, a straw and a spoon in front of me. Can't beat the feeling for such a cheap price.< /Review>

<Review>The burgers and fries here are amazing! They have great service but the only bad thing about it is that it's next to Turlock High which means a lot of kids hangout here, but during the weekends it's a nice time to go out with family and try there ice cream! I recommend Rocky road!<//Review>< GmapID>

We went here because it advertises gluten free food and preparation. It was celiac safe but the staff still needed some direction on cross contamination safety. The food was good but our orders got mixed up a little and had to be changed. The ice cream was delicious but again the staff had to pull out the tubs to see which ones were truly gluten free. They didn't have an ingredient list to look at made yet. The kids working there were nice and friendly and overall it was okay but  they need more training to protect customers health.</Review>

As far as the ice cream goes, we intentially do not have a ingredient list because the manufacturers change thier processes/recepies without any notification to us.  Because some peoples alergies are so severe, we would rather look each time.  We are sorry you didnt have a better experience at Lulu's.

The food is really good (try their garlic fries 👌👌). Also their costumer service is really lovely. You might even see the the owner working as the cashier, which I think is nice. The wait time isn't bad depending on what time of day it is. It's really nice at later hours during the summer because not many people are there.</review>

<Review>Lulu's is not just an ice cream parlor.  They also serve a variety of diner foods like burgers and sandwiches. Time after time, I am met with good food, good milkshakes, and great customer service.  I come here at least once a month and always enjoy the food.  You can even order online or by phone, which is great for when I have limited time for lunch.

The decor is nice and there are tons of ice cream flavors to choose from. They also have a wide variety of fries.  I usually go for their garlic fries, but I also frequent the curly fries or the nacho cheese and jalapeño fries.

If you haven't given this place a try, I highly recommend making it one of your lunch time stops.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Food was good, but I couldn't get passed the candy cigarettes for sale. Motivating kids to smoke by playing smoking is basically helping kids down a path to cancer. Irresponsible! The young man working there stated, "but it doesn't say cigarettes anywhere on the package ".  Sad. Lame excuse to say candy cigarettes are OK because the word cigarettes have been removed from packaging of what we all know what it is. Owner, do the honorable thing, and put the kids before your profits.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>Passing through Turlock and this place was at the top of the list in the Find Me GF app.  This was a fun place to visit! Not only did they have delicious ice cream treats with a lot of choices, but they also had burgers, fries, sandwiches, and salads plus candy and educational toys.  The dining area was comfortable with some nice retro seating options (booths and tables).  The staff members were cheerful, helpful, and engaged with each customer in a friendly, fun manner whether a regular or a first-timer.  The facility was clean throughout including the bathroom.  I highly recommend visiting Lulu's Ice Cream Parlor.  If I lived in Turlock I would be a regular here.</review><resp>None<//resp>< rate>

I came in for a fade and was left with a small patch on one side and when a trim is all I want i still had to pay the full $25. I waited for about 30 minutes and the barber who was done left to the liquor store and ignored me completely I honestly didn’t even feel like paying them for how bad the experience was. If u value your money and time I don’t recommend coming here they are unprofessional and low quality with high pricing, the barber next to stater brothers near APU is ur best bet if ur in the Azusa area.<//review><resp>{'time': 1619105980118, 'text': "So you came for a fade ? But your complaining about paying full price for a trim ? Doesn't make sense 😕  We don't charge by the amount of hair we cut. Sorry to loose you I am sure you'll be fine by the Barbershop offer by stater bros .  Thanks for  giving us a try."}</resp><date>1619061014679< /date>< rate>

Been going there forever.  All the barbers there are easy to talk to extremely friendly and professional.  They give you exactly what you ask for.  Walk in looking like a mess walk out feeling like a million bucks.  This shop definitely had it down right.<//Text>

<Review>A nice old school barber shop with very well trained barbers.
I get my haircut from Al himself, a nice and talkative guy, who talks just the right amount.
Al is a Raiders and a Dodgers fan.
I am always satisfied by me haircut at Big Al's Barber shop<//Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
This is the worst barbershop I have ever been. The man who did my hair cut didn’t have a single ounce of idea about how to proceed. So he kept asking a lot of questions there regard and even asked how many inches I would want. Come on, man!  Hair cutting is sort of art rather than science.  Moreover, he even became angry and impolite and started arguing with me...<//Review>

My barbers are not psychic.  We just don't cut how we want . You seem to get irritated by my barbers questions on how you want your hair. To bad we couldn't satisfy your taste. We appreciate you giving us a try .  Hopefully you find that psychic barber."}< /resp>< GmapID>

Came for a haircut solo. me and another guy have been waiting for 30+ min and straight up got skipped just because a lady walked in with her son saying she had somewhere to go and if they can cut his sons hair. Terrible first come first serve.<//review>

My son gets his hair cut here and they always do a great job. He went yesterday and got his hair done by a young guy with glasses and he did an amazing job. My son can be fidgety but you can't tell by looking at his fresh cut! Definitely coming back soon!<//Review>

<resp>{'time': 1616812392108, 'text': "Hi Amy. I'm really sorry you had a bad experience at the place you went to....but it most definitely is not The Watering Hole. We are a small 1200 sq foot neighborhood bar that serves primarily alcohol and some light snacks. We dont even have a kitchen. Hopefully you find the place you meant to tag....in the mean time will you please remove this review."}< /resp>< Gmap_id>

The Watering Hole transports me back to Wisconsin, sitting in a quiet, grungy space in the basement of a building. Now, all they need is a little bit of snow pelting the windows. They serve great beer on tap and have friendly bartenders, without all the fake fanciness of so many other bars around San Diego. Please, Watering Hole, don't change a thing!<//text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Great little Dive Bar in the strip mall with friendly bartenders and a local crowd from the surrounding communities. They have California Lottery hotspot which is fun to play and a pool table. Some of the bartenders cook and bring out food during Sunday football which is pretty awesome.</text><Name>Barry Meyer</Name><date>1510693557977<//date>< user_id>

A classy little vat in clairmont. It's just what your expect in this cozy little neighbourhood. Friendly locals, cheep bud, and sports on the telly.

I took a traveling Brazilian PhD student here as his first introduction to the United states and he had a great time ( although a bit culture shocked by the tv's)

This place has pool, electrodarts and Kino if your into games, plus beer and cigarettes for the rest to us hedonistic patrons.

I left my jacket on my chair when I left And the bar tender was kind enough to run out and give it back. 8/8 great rate.</text>

Small and dark, I wish it was nice, since it's walking distance from my house, but it's just not. Almost feels like a biker bar. If that's what your looking for have fun.<//Review>

Small, cramped but with decent prices and a better selection than some other dive bars in the area. They’ve got a jukebox and a pool table. Craft beers for $5.50. I prefer peter d’s but that’s just for the atmosphere/space the drink selection here is for sure better.< /review>

Some servings (like the pizza) are really small while others (like the burgers) are ginormous! The food is excellent, just be sure you ask your server about serving sizes!< /review>

Will, really didn't a prove the bartender moving my drink over one just because the people next to me had a extra person show up. And he did not even say anything,  i was in the chair first. I think that's bad service,  my first time here. So wrong. I went to the bathroom i came back and my drink was moved.<//Review>

Home Depot is here, and this strip mall seems to have the ability to flip tenants with ease, vacancies are quickly filled. One bizarre note, the sign that says 'The Plant' the one near the ARCO Station, is blackened and partly melted as if it caught fire at one point, when I first noticed it I thought it was an odd design for a sign, it wasn't until I saw the other sign that isn't melted that I realized that the melted sign wasn't intentional!

<review>This shopping center has some stores and restaurants I like. There is a Starbucks which is at times hard to find parking right in front when it's really busy.  The good thing is there is a large parking lot so I've never had to drive around looking for parking for most of the center. There is a Ross store and a Sally's Beauty Supply store by eachother and a few other small stores.  Overall it's decent for what it is.<//review>< pics>

Lot and lots of shops here. Even more food choices. Everything is very convenient to the colleges nearby and right off the freeway. Kind of a busier location at night for some reason. Maybe because kids aren’t in school so they’re out at the movies in the back? Lol oh there’s a gas station up in here too.< /text>

This is a very large shopping center with a lot of different places to go. Whoever transformed the old GM plant to this was great. Malls seems to be going away while shopping centers are growing.< /text>

<text>They have a lot of shops in close distance and the parking space is pretty great. They have In n out and on the opposite is McDonalds. They also have hometown Buffet which is great on its own. They also have Home Depot, Ross, Party City, babies r us. The place is very nice place also has a theatre very close to In n out. The best part is they have police station right there so it’s safe. I like this place.</text></record></dataset><record>

I'm so glad this place is becoming hip again. So many new shops and a fun 5$ and bellow. I love coming in for a movie early and then spending a few minutes just looking and buying cheap little goodies at the 5$ bellow. The food options are a lot better with Blaze pizza too.<//Text>

Getting better. The property management agency is obviously making an effort for this place. Actually has some name brand stores and is on the verge of actually becoming trendy with a Blaze Pizza, GAP, and Ono's, and Forever21. Home Depot and Ross still drag it down but it has potential!<//review>

Great selection of retail stores and dining establishments. The theater, with several screens,  usually has something everyone would like to see. The Plant security is always patrolling, on foot or in a vehicle, and they are ready to help if you need them. The best part is that there's plenty of free parking. There is more then 7 different entrances to this shopping center. You do not need to get caught up in the In & Out Burger drive thru traffic.</Review>

<review>I had to go drop off my cable box and their new location is at the plant Shopping Center. The store was easy to find, there's plenty of free parking, and there are plenty of other opportunities to shop and eat at that location. Easy in, easy out, at a convenient location.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Not 5 stars as an ultimate destination but 5 stars among shopping centers. It has a good variety of places to eat, a Starbucks, a movie theater, clothing stores, a Home Depot, and more. It also has plenty of free parking.< /Text>

<Review>This place is good. Stores where I can come to for almost anything. It's pretty silent when I'm always there but that's all I can say. Nothing much about this place but it's ok.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I've always enjoyed going to the Plant since it opened. It has obviously gotten a lot more popular and crowded, yet you can still pop in and out if you know where you ate going and what you want.
The layout of the Plant is easy to navagate and you can get a lotta shopping done here in one visit. From Hardware to Finished. And there are a variety of placed that you can get good grub.
And lets not forget about the Movie Theatre. This was my favorite place to go for movie night when i lived in the valley.<//Text><Date>1537554828442< /Date>< pics>

You must make line for premier and rush in like animals to get best seats. If you arrive 3 hours early!   This is so old school.  Come one get the reversed seating!!!!< /review>< Rate>

But I can walk from my house for a casual dinner with options like Blaze pizza, In & Out and Chipotle and a movie at the 16 theater multiplex. I ain't mad at the Plant.</text>< time>

Mostly I visit this shopping center to stop at Home Depot, where I find most of my DIY project materials. My visit this time was different I went to visit GNC stores to buy some supplements. At GNC I purchase Omega Fish Oil which was on sale (buy 1 and get the 2nd for half price). After finishing my shopping at GNC, I made another stop at In & Out burger to get my favorite double meat protein style Burger. It was great visit.<//Text>

<rate>4</rate><Text>Not my favorite shopping center to go to. People are always rude even when driving into a parking spot they fight you for the spot more than other places in LA. When you are at the stores there is a mess everywhere and most places are dirty and with the shelf's out of place and messy. There is only a couple of entrance from the street and with an In-N-Out right out front there is a ton of traffic trying to get in to the parking area.
You will still find good deals and nice places to eat and shop just keep in mind the environment you might run into< /Text>< Pictures>

Miss the babies r us but have other stores like gap and old navy although employees at old navy are rude the store is very clean amd you can find what you need Gap is the same clean and you can find what you need but employees are not that friendly if you ask for a certain size they just brush you off buy say whatever we have there is all we have< /review>

This place used to be the old GM plant on Van Nuys Blvd.  I went to Forever 21 outlet and prices were very low but it is a small store.  You can bring the entire family here for an outing.   Plenty of parking but area is so-so.<//text>
