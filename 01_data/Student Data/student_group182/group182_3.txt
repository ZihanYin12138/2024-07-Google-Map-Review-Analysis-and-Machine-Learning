<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>if i could give this place a half or no star i would, i just got back from there and they had the worst customer service out of every location i have ever been to, the lady who was making the food clearly didn't want to be there, was just tossing everything together, no presentation like at other stores, i went in with a coupon to get a free sub with a purchase of a combo meal, and she charged me for chips and a drink separately from the sub. by the time i got home the sub just fell apart.. they need more training at the location.. i will not be returning<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Date>

<name>AdaJesus Chibuikem</name><Review>I liked that I was able to get my sandwich as a salad instead. It was clean and neat. Baring the occasional sounds of the door opening as customers came and went, It was quiet when I visited so I was grateful to be able to study there for a bit while I ate. Stayed a little longer after eating. The members of staff were nice. Professional and courteous.  Will be back<//Review></record>

This location has THE WORST customer service. The employee's don't acknowledge you when you walk in. They all seem to have an attitude(including management). They are very slow at making orders and do not pay attention to the detail of how you would like your sandwich. Also, will play favoritism in servicing according to their personal association to the customers. Employee stopped  between making my second sandwich to serve another "regular" customer. RUDE AF!!!<//Text>

<review>I don't know... They a lot different from when they first came out. I used to go there back then all the time but today, I don't really care for them, they have so much that that make, but I only had they sandwiches with bread not all the new stuff but the last time I was there I thought I try another kind of sandwich cuz I always got steak & cheese, so I got some kind of sandwich, it was called chicken, beacon, advocodo with ranch dressing.. Got home and it was missing the Beacon ranch & the dam advocodo! That was the last time I went there, they rude there too so I'm good... I'll continue to make my own slamming sandwiches... I make a good one too lol..</review>< pictures>

Every time I come to this subway the stuff are really unwelcome, I feel pressure at the moment of making an order and some times I have to repeat myself three times. I'm not sure if the employees have learn that having a good smile will make the difference. I've been in many subways and Ive had very opposite experience. Regardless of the location (Pittsburgh) I think the employees should have a more friendly attitude...<//Text>

Friendly staff, I like the variety of sandwiches, salads and Soups that you can order,  and of course you can indulge a bit on the variety of cookies and chips. Subway is a healthy choice for people who want to eat a little healthier.< /Text>

<text>Horrible service. Employees were slow and inefficient. Bathroom was locked when i asked for the key they said it had been locked inside and only a manager could retrieve it. All the girls making the food had long fake nails which practically poked through their gloves. Unsanitary and disgusting.

I have been a money mart customer for many years now and am always satisfied with my service. The ladies there always remember my name and are all friendly professional and wonderful. I don’t live in the neighborhood anymore but always go out of my way to stop at the Valencia location whenever I need anything.< /Review>

<review>Its a late review but here it is. First, I’d like to give a BIG shout-out to the store manager of this location. She’s very professional, polite and very friendly! I used to go to a different location but now that I encounter her at this location, I’ll definitely start coming here to send money to my family back home. When I came there were some lines but they work fast that customers were being help right away with less wait.< /review></record></dataset><record>

A very friendly and professional employees will greet you and help you with either cashing your checks(any kind), buy money orders, or send money via Western Union. Location is clean and bright due to the natural lights from the windows. All employees are very efficient and all of them are trying to help all customer as fast as possible. I’m definitely coming back here again.<//Review>

The Store Manager Jane was very helpful, very professional and helped out my situation with patience and made me feel that she cared and because of my great experience I would recommend others to go to this store. One of the customer service reps Sheila was also helpful and showed me great customer service.<//text>

Worst location ever!!! They dont even deserve one star at all!! This is my second time here first experience was bad just like the second time, same lady and did the same thing. First time, i was next in line she was in the middle of helping me until her friend i think from next door comes in and she starts talking to her for awhile and forgets that customers are FIRST!! Second time, she did the same exact thing but this time i was waiting in line and i was up next but WHAT A COINCIDENCE her same exact friend comes walking in straight ahead of me and helps her first!! She didnt even have to wait in line, this is ridiculous and obsurd, it took an hour of helping her to help me next. Dont even bother coming here. Only one worker with 10 people waiting.<//text>

<Text>I went and I'm a Saturday at 4 p.m. and waiting in line for nearly three hours. When I got to the window the woman told me it was too late to cash checks. It was evident that she was tired and wanted to go home. I've also cash checks there over the past 5 years over a dozen times. The women couldn't grant me the courtesy and would rather lie than help me and help me out . The only reason I went to this location is because the other location was open but locked nobody was in the window<//Text>< pics>

This is my very first review ever of a place and i believe that i need to do it. This is the WORST place in the area, service is just terrible, your wait will be at least 1 hour ( my wait time was 2 hrs).
And prepare to see the weirdest people in town. I would prefer a really hard kick on the balls than come back there.<//Review>

I have been coming here for many years. The staff knows me by name and waves to me when I walk in. If you are patient and friendly they will return the consideration. As in any situation, belligerence gets you nowhere.< /Text>

(Translated by Google) They charge a lot of interest in payments of 300 dollars a fortnight, they pay the capital less than 20 dollars, they get about 100 times what they lend.

(Original)

<Text>The nice lady gives good haircuts but doesn’t open up on time at 10:30am. It’s a business ya know. People are waiting to get a haircut here and her making the customers wait is not good for business. I would recommend she open up on time or if not she’ll lose customers that way.<//Text><rate>2<//rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>102794976832337557251<//UserId.>< response>

< Review>
This barbershop offers a value-packed professional service! To top that they make it more personal by keeping track of your cut, so you can dispense with the discussion about how you want the haircut and get down to important topics like sports, fishing, and other island life topics. I will be getting regular cuts from this barbershop and I am actually looking forward to it!</Review>

The lady is super nice and I’ve never had a problem with my haircut. If for the price compared to what others charge around here and “so called simple haircuts” because god forbid a man needs more than that ?! Then I gladly will sit in this chair repeatedly.</Text>

<Text>Worst service I ever had. $10 haircut is decent but not when you cant do a simple high and tight. I took a friend of mine too and he asked for a 5mm and she cuts it at a 3mm. Come on now. She knows how to only cut these common trends haircuts that are horrible.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Cecilia is great. She's relaxed, caring, asks questions, gives a good clean cut that's very affordable in a neighborhood packed with more pretentious options. One of those places where you can't help but start chatting with the other people in the room.< /Text>

Small cozy place with one chair but you cant beat the price. 10 dollars a cut. The lady barber is very friendly and she gets the job done efficiently and quickly. Definately recomend u get your next hair cut here</Text>

Celia is awesome.  Everytime I go in there, no matter how long I have waited in between haircuts I get up from the chair happy.  This authentic neighborhood shop used to be run by Celia's dad.  She is doing the family business proud. I don't go anywhere else.  Why would I?</Text>

I agree with other reviewers on the level of customer service here.  It used to be great, but the last time I went to exchange some items I purchased online, I was given attitude for apparently no reason by this girl who reminded me of Justin Bieber.  This is not how you service your customers in a high end retail store.  It’s is quite a busy store.  I prefer them all over the Fashion Valley location.< /Review>

<rating>1</rating><review>Agree with the previous post that said this is the worst Lululemon location in San Diego. I bought some pants at the Del Mar location and was blown away by the wonderful sales staff. I didn’t realize Lululemon participated in the Health Care Workers discount and went this location to have it applied to my purchase 3 days prior. The rude checkout girl said, “we aren’t supposed to do price adjustments, but I’m feeling generous because you didn’t know.” This is the first health care discount I’ve used and the LAST time I will be coming to this location. Also, I just called this store to let the manager know about this incident instead of leaving a negative review but was told she is on her lunch break. When I asked when’s good time to call back, I was told “Welllll, she’s taking a 30 min lunch break, so in 30 minutes.” Extremely poor customer service from the top to the bottom.< /review>< Pictures>

<text>Worst lululemon location in the San Diego county. The girl with the short blonde pixie cut really needs a lesson on decent customer service.
We were exchanging a pair of pants that were bought two weeks ago and developed a hole. The associate who initially helped us on the floor told us it was no problem and they’d be happy to exchange them! We go to the counter where the associate with the pixie cut tried to give us the hardest time, saying they can’t exchange them. She had attitude and shouldn’t work in a customer service oriented environment if she’s not willing to make things right for customers.

This kind of service doesn’t happen at the La Jolla stores; I highly suggest going there instead.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Find this store upstairs inside Fashion Valley Mall. I always check out the clearance section located inside the store back area where you can get up to 25% off sometimes.
Expect to pay a little more here vs other stores and that may turn you off to the idea of buying what they have, but I've been wearing their jogger pants for more than a year and I can tell you that I still don't see any discoloration or stretch,  They look just like they did when I got them brand new after a year of wearing them for all kinds of intense workouts and washing them often.
Friendly Customer service and if they Don't have the size you want in store? They'll order it for you online in a matter of minutes and it will get sent straight to your front door in a few days. Super VIP. Simple but pricey.< /Text><Rate>5< /Rate><resp>None< /resp>< Pics>

<review>Went into the store today with my husband. His shorts were faded from the sun as he wore them a lot this summer because we lived in Hawaii and just moved here.  Well, after speaking with the fitting room for some time, who we were directed to when we first walked in, we come to find out they discontinued the color-probably because of the same problem. Ironic! (she also wanted to check when we bought it and said if it was more than a year she would not exchange). So, he proceeded to pick out a different color only to be told at the check out (after also having to stand back in the long line) that he had to pay an additional $20 because it was not the same price as original purchase price. Mind you, they no longer carried the color he already had a really wanted, so paying extra was even more of an inconvenience. We decided after all the trouble it was not worth it and we would go to another location where we know we will be treated with 5-star customer service. (We didn't go to that location to start with because we were shopping in a different area). Any professional business should stand by their quality and never let a customer turn away disappointed as we were. Probably won't waste our time going to this location again.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Great location, usually has a pretty good stock of men's and women's activewear. Clearance racks are a boon when trying to keep purchases reasonable as this chain can get pretty expensive. Helpful staff, even when they are busy. Also offers a discount for military. Overall great experience.</Text>< Response>

I usually do all my shopping online, but I was at fashion Vally so why not. I was in the pants section and a sales associate by the name of Holly or Molly came up to the area. Of course helped everyone around me, but failed to ask if I needed assistance in any way. I was struggling to find a size but of course she gives me a dirty look and asks the next person who had just come up to the pants section if they needed assistance. I myself am very independent, but there was a gentleman who had been standing in the area longer then I and not once did she ask him if he needed assistance either.

I love lulu and their products. Wear them on a daily but as for their customer service, it was horrible. Sales associates as holly/molly give lulu a bad look... this isn’t the first time I go to a storefront and receive bad customer service.</text>

I ordered an item online for pick-up as a surprise to my boyfriend. I called to ensure the item was ready (which it was) and had the pleasure of speaking to Enzo. Because this item was a surprise I was concerned that my boyfriend would just pick it up and leave. Enzo assured me that he would make sure to help him find the right size and give him recommendations if what I ordered wasn’t ideal. Thank you Enzo for the peace of mind!!:)</Review>

<review>Tuna was Chunk tuna and the best I've had in a while. Great atmosphere and sides include fresh baked cookies and giant pickles! The iceberg lettuce is shredded thin. They offer sprouts! 8" subs!< /review>< pictures>

My family and i ate here all the time, mostly delivery. But over the last year the quality of service has gone down hill and today 11/26/16 it has hit rock bottom. Over the last year there has been zero consistency other than having something wrong. From the bread being super soft to rock solid and missing something on the order. The quality of the meat has dipped a little bit in the times we are in, that is understandable. The produce has even taken a hit. I have had brown lettuce, soggy onions, too much or too little sauce. They even stopped offering the sauce cups  to prevent that. And not to  mention the extremely long wait times for delivery, 39 minuets when quoted 15-20 and lets not forget the excuses. I should have written a book with all of the excuses they have given me  over the last year. It would've been a New York Times best seller.  All in all i will NEVER order from this location again. And for the record I have left tips as much as $20 for three sandwiches. And over the last year I have been in almost constant contact with the store managers about the quality issues. Yet nothing has been fixed. I will not be buying from here or sending business there way.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dcd600032ee8a1:0x173f2d4677722904</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Went here for an interview and glad I didn't end up working here. The manager Bruce and his coworker were extremely unprofessional. He literally was high during my interview and proceeded to doodle all over my paperwork. Sad that this company has people like this representing them. Dont bother with this business.</Review>

<Text>Sorry I didn't like their sandwiches there's no real variety and you have no choice for the most part of what you have on your sandwich alright guy I was supposed to be</Text></record></dataset><record>

This place is amazing. I came in here stressing out about my car, midiatly the owner helped me redirect my anxiety and the receptionist Cam was absolutly amazing. Very understanding people that under stand the value of everyone's hard earned dollars. They diagnosed my problem, they are working with me on the price and just over all being super azing supportive and optimistic. Good work costs money no matter what, but these people here didn't make me feel like a lamb to the cosmic slaughter and for that I am grateful. I WI BE RETURNING here for future work. They are 1 of 2 shops that allow me to feel like I am in good hands. Dimitri is the man!<//Text>

<Date>1588101826434< /Date><review>Lucio and Dimitri were the ultimate professionals in lowering my Genesis G80. Brought in springs I purchased from Korea and they were not seating correctly. Rather than taking a risk Lucio made me aware which gave me an opportunity to speak w the seller, forums, and a few other sources w experience w my particular vehicle. In the end we resolved the issue quickly and they kept their word with a generous labor cost. Highly recommend these guys. Very personable and friendly as well. We need to support quality business owners in this time and Autobahn Performance definitely earned my respect.< /review>< user_id>

Not only that I walked in when they were about to close, they manage to squeeze me into their schedule. Prices were manageable but their work will save me more money in the long run.  Highly recommended. Owner and workers, just a bunch of friendly guys that just love what they do. Will come back whenever I need another alignment.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Sometimes you gotta believe the hype.

These guys, as promised by hundreds of other reviewers, were GREAT.   I have a Subaru BRZ with an aftermarket sport suspension that needed adjusting, and funny noise in the front end.  Lucio got my car up on the rack, and had the problem nailed down in 10 mins. They were able to squeeze the job in quickly, and had me out the door with new wheel bearings, an alignment, and a full coilover and dampener adjustment.  Great service, great work, and my car performs better than it ever has.

In an ocean FULL of auto shops, pick THIS shiny fish.<//Review>< pictures>

I'm still smiling haha I was working with Dimitri and Lucio who were all around informative and knowledgeable.

I had just bought the truck a month ago and Lucio noticed that the bushings and endlinks on my factory Sway Bar were worn and cracked. They replaced them with even better quality parts, and installed the leveling kit within a matter of a few hours! Their service was awesome, not to mention their open communication and transparency.

Needless to say, I love the way my truck looks! I will definitely continue doing business with them in the future.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Brought my vehicle to get serviced by Autobahn and i was disappointed. My motor mounts where broke and needed repair. I then got the vehicle back still making the same noise it did with broken mounts with new mounts. I told the mechanic and he said it was fine and i had to get additional work done to stop the noise. Great thing i got a second opinion because if not i would've spent money i didnt need to. The owner only gave me money back for the part when in fact infelt i should have got back a little more because the mechanic gave the car back when it was clearly not repaired. I hope my experience was just mine and it doesnt happen to others. I hope they can learn from this and become a better company.</Review>

<review>Great Customer Service! I stopped by (no appointments or anything) for a small odd job (DIY home suspension work & needed a SAFE spring compressor) and they care of me right away. Even allowed me to watch them work as these were my parts and I needed them done a specific way. The owner and the Tech were on the floor chatting up with me. This is a great business and will definitely be coming back.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I've been taking my cars to Autobahn for years now.   Their prices are reasonable.  Maybe on the higher end but still reasonable.  The owner is very cool. Makes you feel welcomed and like you're family. All these years and still have no complaints. Over five years now since I first showed up with my parents. Now i have a family of my own and I'll continue to use their services.  I've had my brakes done, alighnments, speakers put in. purchased tires and rims. I know my immediate family has had way more than that.  They gurantee their work.   Just talk to the owner and he will give you a good deal.</review>

<Review>I replaced a cracked AC compressor off my 2007 nissan altima and needed refrigerant added. Called around and was quoted $160 - $200 for the service not to mention they were booked and I needed to make an appointment. I decided to stop at this autoshop next to the Uhaul on Florin road and was able to get the service done cheaper than I was previously quoted at the big name autoshops. What made the experience great was the fact I was able to get my car worked on that very day thanks to the quick work by Jose, Dmitri and team. Thanks again guys.<//Review></record>

Owner was cocky, and was just throwing price out there. After disliking the price, he lowered $10, calling it a discount. What a joke. I went somewhere else for a lot less.</Review>

<Text>Half the dash is dusty, center console not vacuumed, not wiped clean, passenger seat still with crumbs on it. I understand the minimum wage guys no caring much , but the manager shrugging his shoulder and condescendingly explaining that, “a $20 wash only includes a little bit of wipe down” is just upsetting. Who decides which half of the dash is cleaned for $20? Not even trying to correct the mistake is outrageous. Last month they were begging customers, now no one even cares.< /Text>< pics>

They wanted to charge me full price on top of what I’ve paid on Groupon. The (guy)cashier inside has no customer service. Does not know how to communicate well. Last time I come here.

The exterior washes can be upgraded to full services by adding the value of each wash from the purchase rate in this case it's the rate from groupon. We didn't try and cheat you out of a wash or try and charge you more than necessary."}<//resp></record>

This was my first time here. The cashier was friendly. I paid 24.99 for the number 2 wash. I didn't have to wait long and they did a really good job cleaning over all. The rear bumper was a little dirty but the car over all was shiny and clean. I will be returning.< /review>

<review>I’m impressed by the quality and customer service. Had some serious scratches on my black car and a body shop suggested VAS detailing & buffing service, before spending money on a costly paint job. They did a fantastic job buffing out numerous scratches and impeccably detailed and waxed the car.

This is one of my first Google reviews, ever. I can truly say that the staff and managers made it a great experience!

I’ll be returning to Valencia Auto Spa!< /review>< Pictures>

( No way)

They do a great job here! I had one experience where my side mirror was broken in the wash tunnel. They ordered the part and repaired it within a week no questions asked. Love this car wash and I won’t go anywhere else!<//Review>

If I can give a negative review I would, if you look at my previous reviews I almost never make a bad review since I know how a bad review can hurt a company, however, be ware of this place I took my  Range Rover with new rims that were placed two days ago and they scratched the rim so bad.  I try talking to the employee and the manager and they kept saying that it was not done there. I know for a fact it was done there because like I said they were new. The manager didn’t really care, so maybe if the owner sees this review please respond. The manager is not very capable of dealing with complaints.</review>

Used to go every week. I’m not sure what’s changed, ownership? New employees? But the lack of customer service is something I can’t take anymore. Down right rude! I don’t need to spend 30 dollars a week for attitude. Also, they never do what I ask. I take my dogs out a lot and need a really good vacuum, I pay for the premium wash and always request a great vacuum...I will pay extra. I always have to redo it now when I get home. Not doing it anymore. Started going to the car wash on mcbean by the shell station. So much better. They are nice and very kind. I’ve had with those snotty girls at the register. They should smile more.</Text>

There are very few places that I trust to wash my Tesla, but this is the main one. The washing and drying is all done by hand and you can watch the entire process. I get the two month high end deal and I love it. I get new car fragrance and everyone still thinks my beautiful car is brand new.<//review>

Paid $65 and my car came out looking like it got a $5 wash. Before I even sent it in I told them I needed a couple small stains taken out of the driver seat and armrest along with a sticker removed on the back window since I had just purchased the car and I didn’t mind paying more. The guy washing my car brought it out and the car was still dirty. Stains still in the seats and armrest and sticker on the window. I asked him about it and he said he was told to just wash it??? So he went back and rubbed the seat and armrest with a towel which still didn’t remove the stains and then scraped the sticker off. Gunk was left from the sticker he didn’t even bother removing. I waited about an hour and a half for possibly the worst wash I’ve ever had. I used to come here often and I previously even did business with this car wash but quality is not a concern. I definitely will not be returning.</Text>

<review>I REPEAT do not go here. I went in at 10:30 AM on a Wednesday went straight home and looked at my car. I realized there was not only a chip in my windshield but also a chip on my friends windshield who was the car in front of me. Called the manager to notify her, took her 30 minutes to call me back and  she did nothing. She said it's the heat from outside, (it was 88 degrees) that I should look it up on google, and I should have called earlier. Both me and my friend had chips and scratches so this is VERY unlikely. So went in paying 11$ for a car wash came out having to pay $75 for my windshield to be repaired. NOT PLEASED. Will not return ever, highly dissapointed and frustrated. I would understand if it was just my car but it was also my friends so I know it was something there. DO NOT COME HERE UNLESS YOU WANT YOUR WINDSHIELD CHIPPED.< /review><rating>1</rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures><user_name>Tori C< /user_name></record>

Stay away, bait and switch for car detailing, they will quote you a price over the phone, and when you get there they will try to charge you way more. If you try to negotiate, they will eliminate things from your package and still quote you higher than what they said on the phone for a full detail. I went with a mobile detailer, came to my house super convenient and charged less<//review>

<review>I have been here about 7 times, i usually go after getting my oil changed at oil stop because you get a free car wash (just the outside of your car) The past four times I have been getting the inside of car cleaned as well, it’s an additional 10 bucks, why not! Today was the last time I pay them to clean the inside. I never write reviews but I’m so freakin over it. Every single time they don’t clean the dash board, also there is always still dirt all over the doors.  I get it it 10 bucks but seriously?!? It looks like no has even tried. Also I always ask for a scent in my car and they never put it. I try and ask the employees but they just say they did it.  I hate writing stupid reviews but I’m so over it! Hopefully this saves someone’s money!<//review>< pics>

They always leave my red kia optima shiny as can be. Thank you guys! There's a couple of scratches on my tint but not to make a big enough deal out of it. Overall Thank you for the great service and such sweet ladies working at the cashier. One of them even found my lost phone for me and returned it. THANK YOU!!! I'll see you guys next time! Thank you for taking care of my car!!!!

Car detailers simply did not pay attention to details. My detailer left spots on my car and didn't give me my air freshener I paid for.</review>

{'time': 1501196035623, 'text': "Hello Nancy,\nOur apologies for a late start a few of our employees got caught in the traffic during that terrible accident on the 14th freeway, but it still doesn't excuse the vacuums not being attached or turned on. We're working on different methods in order to be more efficient and run a smoother opening when an incident like this happens. I would like to invite you to return for a complimentary full service carwash."}< /resp>
< Review>
I am a regular weekly customer.  I came in during the week when they were supposed to be opening at 8 am.  I had to call on the phone to get someone's attention and they asked how I was paying and what kind of wash.  5 minutes after opening time  I finally got in.  Then I went to use the self-serve vacuums and they were all disconnected. When I asked one of the workers to help me they all disbanded.  A very nice gentleman customer, in a suit mind you, came and tried to help me plug the vacuum in without success. Finally, a worker came and fixed the two vacuums that weren't working. Many times, I have come in the morning and they're not turned on, also.  I've been going to this place for a long time and never had such a hassle.<//Review>

< Review>
You guys rock! So much better than your other location in Whittier off of 1st. So glad to see you guys open up another location. You guys have cornered the market for Taco Tuesday. You guys offer quality food at an unbelievable price. Don't change a thing!
$10 all you can eat tacos on Tuesday and Thursday is unheard of. Try it for yourselves and see what all the hype is about!< /Review>

The ambience was great. A DJ spinning some tunes not too loud to where you're screaming but loud enough to enjoy. The DJ played Reggaeton, Pop, 90's and 80's. You'll enjoy everything about it.</Text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x80c2d36c601c60f5:0xc453c81050e1bd36<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

My fiancee and i had dinner at Tacos & Miches : uptown Whittier last Friday.  the location is spacious but cozy.  lots of seating of various types: barstools, standard tables and picnic style bench seating at tables.
the food was super awesome -scientific term-
we had the Queso Fundido, Mexican Fries, and Carne Asada Tacos along with Chicharon Tacos, along with delicious Chips and 3 types of Salsa....all was so good that we will definitely be coming back to eat more deliciousness.....and you should go there too....
the service was super awesome as well -see above for scientific terminology-
Dominic, Tiffany and Monique cook and serve up delicious food.  we will be back for sure....maybe we will see you there.< /text>

Uptown Whittier caters everyone time and time again. The Dining Scene In Uptown is more than  Pictures of Churches, Parks and Private Colleges. Nestled in one of California’s early predominant caucasian suburban neighborhoods. To name a few, Richard Nixon (Water Gate). A theme from the 1960s counter-culture revolution. Now a preserved memory through the passage of time and serving as a right of passage for any one like those that came before to ride  the wave or have surfed along with it. It’s a place that is built for public enjoyment to lure you back to let your senses wind the hands of time like a high school or college bound student wearing their head high looking straight into the future wondering how time flies when sipping tequila or a margarita sprinkled with lemon to eat and drink like a native of Whittier’s Uptown.<//text>

This place HAS potential...but the service lacks. 1st time there for St Patrick's day and the staff didn't know about the promotions posted on their own IG account. Took way to long to get drinks let alone napkins and limes. Need to hire more help. Dj playing music inside was great, you can hear music even from outside. Azteca tacos are a must try, most delicious tacos I've had in a while. Definitely going to give them another shot and I'll be going back.< /Text>

<text>Hard to find at first since it’s on a busy street. However good environment, love music, rock, alternative music and my favorite Iron Maiden. Had the cook make me something special, gave me a mulita de chorizo, Jalisco taco which is deep fried potato taco with a very tasty and kicking salsa and a Cali taco de carnitas with fries. I love the small portions to be able to try everything on the menu.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN2vMKkLsUEfN918c7qrPwpB9UK58YVItXZjRsI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPwD_U0UOpNmLMfbTnlePrdvbE4HgJfU_fKWfoc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYT_dleq-lGqahIMSIH5ovs6gbTfMtpu9NomqJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRAPP2I5xg9XdhkSFnNiZDWTnGMNlAnxojudp_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcdq9x3tlYHC9GVC1EFTUaIgITtjxwOsbffWbV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< Resp>

I never post reviews on google, but this is the first time in a long long time that I genuinely didn’t like the food. I ordered what they call Mexican fries which is meat, with cheese guacamole and pico de Gallo. And it was a cluster of food mixed terribly, I also bought my girlfriend chicken flautas, and they were soggy and tasteless, 10 dollars for 4 flautas with no beans and rice too. When I paid for the food and was leaving on tip on my debit card, the employee looked over my shoulder as well to see how much i’d tip..... Seriously ? LOL WHAT. Idk, I’ve been wanting to try this place, but my first experience here was the worse I’ve had in a long long time</Text>

Heard this place had good tacos & Miches  Today I visited, I guess it was my bad luck experience.  One hour & forty five min. wait time after order taken.  A few orders in front of me & a few people in line outside.  After a little over one hr.  waiting the guy announced no more carne asada and asked everyone to choose another type meat!   No apology at all!<//text>

<Review>It was good.  The miches where descent.  The tacos were good. The chicharon tacos had good flavor but they were soggy. The tortilla fell apart.  Had to eat it with a fork.  Service was a bit slow. Only one server for three while place.</Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2d36c601c60f5:0xc453c81050e1bd36<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Fish & shrimp tacos had good flavor. Salsas were tasty. Asada & tortillas were dry& disappointing. Will give it another try for a burrito but there are better taco shops in uptown.< /text>

It’s a really good spot for tacos. I give it a four because there wasn’t really anything special about their tacos; they were just good tacos.</Text>

This place is absolutely delicious and actually not your typical Korean fare. An absolute gem of a find, and the woman running it seems to be doing everything which is equally amazing.<//Review>

< Review>
They are still serving up delicious food after all these years! I have been back countless times now and have ordered food through delivery during the strict COVID days in 2020. Their Gamjatang (pork bones with potatoes stew) is one of my favorite item to order on their menu. I love the taste of the sesame leaves and the rich pork bone broth flavored with sweetness from the napa cabbage. I also tried their dwaejiguk which is a pork jowl soup made with different cuts of pork ranging from pork belly to offals. Clean offal taste and the soup is thick and hearty. Adding in the salty shrimp and salt seasoning on the table make this soup so satisfying on a cold night.

The menu has changed from 2017 and they have added many more items now catering to the broader audiences. The Galbijjim is a generous serving of spicy braised beef short ribs that can fill 3 hungry stomaches. It's saucy with a good blend of sweet, savory, and spice. The beef flavor was nice and tender from slow cook and braise in the delicious sauce. Get it with the melted cheese on top! Their Rosé Tteokbokki noodles is one of my newest favorite on their menu. It's a special twist to the normal tteokbokki where they added bacon, sausage, cream, cheese..? to the dish to give it that nice creamy and smoky taste as another layer on top. Really delicious and I kept going back to this dish while I'm enjoying my meal.

Other favorite items from this place, their galbitang (super satisfying), spicy cabbage galbitang (a sweeter and soy bean version of galbitang), soondae (they have perfected this and you eat with the salt and shrimpies on the table), korean fried chicken (KFC), bossam (pork belly wraps), and jokbal (pig trotters). The Korean cuisine here is one of the more authentic taste to the ones I've had in Korea! Service is kind and they care about the quality of the food they serve. Support your local businesses!

<text>The kimchi is surprisingly robust. I eat it all every time.

We call ahead and pick it up for dinner (let them know you'll just heat it up at home).

There's outdoor seating in a pandemic, but we usually call ahead and pickup for heating up gajamtang at home. Quick and easy, and super tasty.<//text>< pictures>

<Text>Pork bone soup (or literally potato soup "gamjatang" is the Korean translation) is the best. Easily feeds 3-4 people. The kimchi is surprisingly robust. I eat it all every time. We call ahead and pick it up for dinner (let them know you'll just heat it up at home). Highly recommended.<//Text>< date>

I miss this place! Its March 17, 2021 and Im looking forward to going out to dine here again. Its been a huge favorite for myself in the bay area.

This is one of those authentic Korean food I was introduced to when I was younger and glad it found me. I do wish I was with a group to eat more of the soup toppings.

Their service and welcoming is A1. Plus they always have Korean soap operas playin or tv games going on. Love it<//review>

We visited this place when it was pouring and the bubbling stews we ordered(soondae soup and neckbone hangover stew) hit the spot for a cold rainy day. I suspect most Korean-Americans like myself will find the food very authentic and comforting. Those who are new to this rustic type of Korean cuisine might need a bit more courage as there is a lot of offal in the soups and stews served here. For a safe choice, go for the galbi tang - a clear broth beef rib soup.</text>

Legit Korean food- make sure to get their specialty blood sausage. I prefer the one with more meat/blood over the kind with glass noodle filling, which has an odd spongey texture for my taste</Review>

<review>Still just as good as take out and super quick (15 mins from time of phone order). One of the best galbi tang I've had and the only place I've seen so far that has the assorted pork soup (daeji gukbop) with pork belly, jowl meat, and shoulder butt. Both are super delicious and comforting. Also some of the best kimchi I've ever had. This place is one of my favorites in the bay area.</review><Time>1585879332819<//Time><UserId.>107226888077668130467<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We ordered the "Spicy Braised Beef Short Ribs" (see photo attached). That was enough for the two of us, the leftovers also fed us for lunch the next day. Needless to say, great value. If you're a party of 3,  I wouldn't hesitate to get that for the table. I loved gnazing on those bones. Warning: it can get messy eating this. The sauce was also the right amount of spicy for us.

Service is fast, that's all I care about. The space wasn't heated, so we had to keep our jackets on, but otherwise no issues at all.

Pverall, this place is really great if you are looking for some spicy korean food.< /Text>< Rate>

<text>Moo Bong Ri has been in my radar ever since Von's Chicken departure. At first it was kinda hard to get in touch with them, but when I did, then language barrier set me back. Finally message came in telling me a low-key quiet soft opening is imminent. You see, in my profession there are areas that I look for in any place that deals with food. However, I'm not gonna exposed things of those elements today. How I perceive things, is that I don't want to know and don't need to know what I'm being told. I like things that are tangible in your face. So, when I'm told soup is good, I don't buy it till I try it myself. This blood sausage soup is pretty darn tasty IMHO. Bowl came with three banchan and a choice of white or brown wild rice. I chose the latter. It's piping hot and filled with one inch stubbly blood sausage pieces. Soup seems chock full of hearty nutrients with no visible oil sheen floating. You won't be disappointed here.<//text>< pics>

Was super excited to try this place! But I think it's a different type of soondaeguk from what we're used to. Great portion, looks amazing, but the taste is not quite our style.< /review>

really great broth on the short rib soup, and the beef ribs are tender, tasty, etc.  also comes with a dipping sauce.  blood sausage is really excellent too.  parking is tight; there's a parking lot but it's quite small.  service could be more attentive</text>

The pork soup was the best. Don't get the blood sausage. It was super overcooked. The galbi soup was okay too. Jokbal (pork trotters) were passable, but a bit overcooked for my tastes.<//Review>

It was so delicious because I ate it in America after a long time :-)
Ah! The taste of Kkakdugi is also excellent!

During COVID-19, I called String Bead in hopes of finishing a birthday necklace on time. The owner kindly did all of my shopping (apparently I am out of control even over the phone when it comes to beads) and took payment over the phone, offered to set up a phone appointment to send me photos, asked customers to all sanitize upon entry (we were on the phone for a bit so I got to hear the activities), all customers happily complied, and then she met me curbside with my stuff. She had on a mask (properly) as did all customers leaving the shop. And she threw in some extra beads for me because she couldn't decide which ones I'd love best. String Bead for the win! ❤️ Sidenote: this business was great before COVID-19 as well, always a great experience and amazing selection.</Text>

Great store with a lot of classes offered where in the back they have access to a lot of expensive tools for various crafts. They also fix jewelry quickly and reasonably priced. If you only have a few minutes when you stop by you will definitely be late as the browsing is addicting.< /text>

My favorite store for my crafty projects, had two private classes and the instructor did a great job teaching. Love the energy and great customer service.  :) Will be back again for more private classes and purchasing more tools!< /text>

< Review>
I have taken several classes with this organization at Pasadena Bead Show over several years. I keep thinking things will get better but every time I am disappointed and feel that I have wasted my time and money. Last year I took INTERMEDIATE Soldering - which you would think would mean students had soldering experience and we would work on more advanced techniques. Unfortunately that was not so. I’ve also taken a class where soldering was large part of the class but obviously it had not been cleared with the hotel/Fire Marshal because we had to hide our torches for nearly 1 1/2 hours out of a 3 hour class. I’ve signed up for a class and driven over 2 hours only to have String Bead inform me that the class was cancelled. Though they allowed me to take another class it was not what I was interested in. Amazingly, (I guess I’m a slow learner!) I signed up for another class this year and again was disappointed. This class was on Fused Glass. The instructor was totally unprepared and had no supplies ready for class. She had to have someone make several trips to another room to get needed items for the class. Even though one of the students was sitting next to her and repeatedly told her he was hard of hearing, she spoke so quietly that she was asked numerous times to speak up. She read the instructions to us but never gave us examples of what we were actually trying to learn. It was like pulling teeth to get information out of her - I really feel as though she did not know much about the art technique she was supposed to be teaching.
These are just a few examples of the problems that arose in this class and other classes I’ve taken from this company. In writing this and reviewing what I’ve dealt with, I’m EMBARRASSED that I continued to take classes and give this company my business. But don’t worry - I’ve learned my lesson and will NOT be wasting my time or money on them again.< /Review>

Waste of time. Waste of money. I took a class glass fusing class at a Bead Show in Pasadena last night from this company. Class was supposed to start at 6pm. When the teacher finally arrived at 6:10 the teacher had a box of items but nothing was set up or ready for the class ( and I mean nothing!) She gave us a hand out and spent the next ten minutes getting organized. She then began reading from the hand out.... verbatim. She called the COefficient of glass (usually abbreviated COE) CEO.  While she was  reading off the handout she would mill through her box looking for the item or items she was talking about.  She gave no example of successful pieces vs. unsuccessful pieces. The area around where she was demonstrating was so cluttered with her boxes and bags of supplies even the guy sitting directly to the side of her had to stand up to see anything. Not to mention she spoke so quietly we were constantly asking her to repeat herself.
When we finally began working on putting our pieces  together, we got one bottle of aqua net and one brush to apply it to our work between 6 people. ( was it too much to aske for six tiny paint brushes??!) The glass pieces were in a little blue wallet type thing which somebody finally dumped on the table so we could all access it. She had to go to another teacher to get paper towels for us to use and sent another person down the hall to get safety glasses and gloves repeatedly. I paid $79 for this class? This is the second year I have taken a class from these folks and I said last year I wouldn’t do it again because the class was so poorly managed. My friend and I shook on that promise after this class. Waste of time waste of money.< /Text>

The wait staff is always amazing. They are quick and keep your coffee cup full. My only complaint is the hash browns are not cooked enough. This Dennys has been here for forever and is always clean.<//Text>

This place has been my favorite place to go for years, but over those years their staff has really gone downhill and they can't seem to find a manager that can remain professional.</Review>< pictures>

It's kind of hard for me to review this place because my first experience, which was in the late afternoon and arlier in the week and it was amazin.  I ordered a new dish on the menu called Mama D's pot roast.  That was as bold move on my part because I rarely will even order a meat dish from a restaurant, unless I happen to be at Alexanders Steak House or something equivalent to that. Ok, so, to my surprise it was perfect.  The carrots & celery were cooked perfect, just the right crunch still in them.  I'm not into soggy vegetables.  The meat was tender and lean.  Very good quality and cooked perfectly.   I was sold.  I kept talking about it for days, to whoever would listen.  Now FF to last night.  I sold my friend on the idea of going to Denny's to get this amazing Mama D's dish and I had such a bad experience.  They gave me something that slightly resembled what I had ordered earlier in the weak but it tasted horrible. It was salty and soggy and they gave me the wrong flavored milkshake and well, it just spiraled downward from there.  Granted it was midnight and they were probably ready to go home or something?  Anyways, I guess I will chop it up to inconsistent.  It's a gamble, but what isn't?< /review>

I only went in for a much needed cup of coffee. The staff was nice and quick to fill my cup, but the coffee definitely wasn't what I expected.  Dennys I feel is notorious for the oil looking, and very strong tasting coffee. I knew it as he poured it that it wasn't going to be strong, at the hour i went in and the drive I had ahead of me i was expecting that jolt but instead I received coffee that wasn't strong enough to keep me awake as I needed.  I can't comment about the food as I did not have any but if the coffee isn't going to be strong I will not be going back sorry guys.  I hope they bring back the good stuff< /Review>

Good food for decent prices. Best milkshakes and zucchini fries! Nice because it has lots of options. Would recommend a breakfast burrito (sub potatoes for fries), burgers, and taquitos. Something that everyone can enjoy< /text>

Amazing!!!! The set up they have outdoor is absolutely beautiful. It has a tent wedding type of a feeling. Very romantic. The food was amazing!! Due to COVID, they bring all the salad bar to your table, cold and warm. They also bring any meat request that you guys have. We went here for a date night and we had an awesome experience. The staff was very friendly, the food was delicious. My personal favorite was the filet mignon. The Chimichurri is soooo delicious, definitely ask for a side of that. The cheese bread is amazing as well. As sides, the Beef stroganoff was really delicious, the arugula salad, potato salad and the Ceaser salad. I definitely recommend this place if you like Brazilian style steakhouse and all you can eat. Perfect for a date night most definitely.< /text>

Had a super bird grilled turkey, tomatoes and bacon sandwich which was great, other two orders were half plate of nachos and boneless chicken wings which were also good.  Highly recommend this location, they work hard to create a great customer experience.</review>< Time>

<Text>We have been to this location several times. This is our lunch spot when my son has the day off of school. We mostly go for lunch and have ordered burgers, skillets, eggs, pancakes, to salads. The location is off the main street and is clean. It does tend to get crowded during peak times. I have seen many of the same servers. The servers are friendly and most of the time attentive and check on you frequently. The food is good for Denny's. At times the service was slow from time you order to receiving your food. And other times it was quick. Overall it is a good location to eat at. The prices seem higher but since we have not eaten at another Denny's not sure if is this location only or all Denny locations. Worth the visit. If you are a milkshake they bring out the glass and then the silver mixing cup. So it is almost like getting two milkshakes</Text>< name>

<review>The service is always great here. They also are honest about menu portions and made suggestions when I asked. I really enjoyed the steak and I'm glad I listened to the waiter about doing the mashed potatoes (garlic) rather than order more wedges.<//review><username>Shawn Chaudhry</username><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

With nothing else open at 10:30p, this Denny's saved the day, well night!  I had just flown into the area and was starving. This spot was super clean, really great service, nice staff, and the prime rib melt was really really good!<//text>

No where does it say sausage, it came to the table and had sausage on it. I told him I eat it all the time and it has never had sausage. He told me he’s worked at Denny’s for 30 years, and then he had to look at the menu to read it and it doesn’t say anything about sausage. He had to make my plate again.< /text>< pictures>

Don't bother with this Denny's.  They don't honor the free birthday grand slam.  Server was completely rude to me, had no name tag on probably so people can't report him, and claimed he was the manager.  Going to complain to corporate about this location first thing tomorrow< /text>

<rating>3< /rating><text>I just visited this restaurant the other day.  It's alright now.  So much better than before those Indians from India were managing it. I complained about an A1 steak sauce with a straw inside and all they did was took it out and gave the same bottle back to me.  I feel so disgusted and they don't want to give me another steak and new bottle. Those Indians are  disgusting.  They think I tolerate them.  They want me to pay what they served with a contaminated sauce in the meat.< /text>< pictures>

This Denny's is on the El Camino Real and is same as any other Denny's. The staff is good and the place is mostly full. If you are planning for Friday and Saturday late night dinner or snack, keep in mind this place is packed with people. The other positive I see that this place is located near many other food joint and is not secluded. Parking space is not at all limited and this place is wheelchair accessible. Good for kids and adults. Remember you do have many options around this place if you are actually looking for something more elaborate. I like spending time here as it's close to my place. To add they have started a new menu where you can have a complete meal in $4,$6 etc. Do check that out!!</review>

Parking isn't great and the door is in a bad spot.  Employees were very nice and food was cooked correctly.  My main reason for 1 star is the Denny's menu.  I honestly had to just force myself to pick something.  Nothing on the menu looked that great.  Denny's just isn't that great, nothing negative about this one in particular.  If you like Denny's menu you'll be fine here unless ambiance is important to you.< /text>< user_name>

<Text>2 fried eggs, 2 bacon strips, 2 pancakes, all tasty for $4; 24 hours a day. What's not to like; especially when everything else is closed. Never get eggs prepared any way except fried to avoid nasty pasteurized egg mixes. Hash browns and sausages are tasty too. Rest of the menu is hit or miss. This Denny's is clean and comfortable. Service is good. 4 stars for 24 hour convenience, 3.5 stars for Slams.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Review>The worst service ever. For the second time in a row we have experienced really bad service here. My kids love the desserts out here so we typically come after 10:30 pm for milkshakes and ice cream. We were seated for 25 mins and no one even bothered to come get our orders. The servers were just chatting amongst themselves. We had to call them 3 times before one of the servers came to take our order. Never come here if you can help it.</Review>< Name>

I now give them 4 stars for upping their game with customer service. Keep up the excellent work guys!

Previous review:
Only reason they got any stars at all was cause the server which took my order was very nice otherwise wouldn'th get any. My order was pretty messed up. Old pancakes that were almost burned, gave me like half an egg and forgot the bacon.

Bad idea to order it for take-out. Only way to get what you want is to order while dining in</text>

This was a good Denny's. We walked in and the hostess was clearly overworked but still so very friendly. She needed a raise. A big one.
We were seated at a comfortable booth. After chatting with the hostess we took a second to look at the menu. As soon as we opened them our waitress came over asking for us to order. A little taken aback (luckily we already knew what we wanted) we ordered and she hobbled away without a word. She was a very interesting elder woman. After delivering our food and the check (without asking if we wanted anything else) maybe ten minutes max later, she hobbled away and never came back. We enjoyed the food, it was tasty. I personally enjoy the dinner food at Denny's versus IHOP.
All in all, not a terrible decision and it was a tasty one at that.

I would recommend this place.</Text>

Best Denny's in Santa Clara

I've frequented many Denny's restaurants throughout the US, and this one is my new favorite.   The Service is Excellent, the Food is Excellent and the price is usually the same wherever you go (but still good).

I often get the Pot Roast and I can say that it has been a long time since I've considered ordering it again in the same sitting (to go).

Denny's always has great down-home favorites such as Pot Roast,  Country-Fried Steak, Spaghetti and Meatballs,  or Fish and Chips.  This restaurant does them all a service.

If you want a good idea of how amazing Denny's can be, eat at this location.<//text>

I go here often. Breakfast all day! Its fatty and not very health friendly but i burn the calories by some physical activities the next day.

They have a good customer service and good parking spots. For some reason i have seen cops cars always around the store but its a safe neighborhood. I lived close to this place for almost a year.< /text>

The place is okay as long as you go with what ever they want to place in front of you.
Not acceptable service.... Remember, you order what you want. And should only be charged for what you asked for. Not what ever the service wants.<//Text>

It's Denny's. It's a Denny's.  The staff sometimes forgets about you, but it's a Denny's.  The food is decent, unless it's microwaveable, but again it's a Denny's.  The prices are reasonable, butcha know, it's a Denny's. There is always plenty of parking, because how often do people get together and say, "You know where we should go?  Denny's."</Text>

I guess I am the only customer who got a cold skillet and warm ice water. And no refill. My server evaporated after leaving my food. I'm used to hot food and cold ice water. Maybe I'm just being a diva about it, but, it should have been better. This was the first time in my life where I authentically felt a tip was undeserved. I work my ass of for my wages, they should too.</review>

I ordered an omelet online for pickup. I paid extra for avocado and the avocado had a lot of black spots on it. It was so gross that I through most of it in the trash. I also ordered sour dough toast and they gave me wheat. When you are hungry and looking forward to eating a healthy meal but get disappointed when you get back to your hotel room is a truly disappointing. Check your order before leaving this restaurant!!!!<//Review>

One of the best Denny's I've been to! First time ever that the inside and outside did not smell of sewer/like bathroom.
The food was good, dining ware was clean and the staff was friendly.

Definitely a Denny's worth going back to from now on.< /text>

Too bad. It's a nice place with good staff and food. But they allow one of their customers to smoke directly out side the front door
I complained both to Denny's corporate and the local manager. Apparently Denny's doesn't care about second hand smoke< /review>

<Text>Horriable service very slow not friendly at all. Went in to have lunch by myself I stood at the front as staff walk by me not even makeing eye contact or acknowledging me while standing there waiting to be seated. I finaly just sat down at the rail. Stuff took about 10 min to get my drink order and about another 5 min to get me my beverage (I ordered a water) ordered a basic 3 egg with sausage and hash brown breakfast took 20 mon to get my food. It was sitting in the window sitting there for at least 10 min. The place was not busy at all. Whem I got my food it was cold my eggs were soggy hash browns were soggy not crispy I ended up just leaving horriable dennys diffenly will not be coming back to this Denny's< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808fca4f347a8849:0x625b3143a9baf7b4< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Boke, the food was terrible. Everything we had was soggy, even the cheese was strange tasting.  My colleague had chicken and it tasted terrible. Not sure why but it wasnt nice and he only eat one bite. I wouldn't recommend this place considering how any great places are close by<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<review>1/2 star only because in the food industry alls it takes us a few rotten apples to spoil  the bunch BA HUMBUG  DENNYS it's not even funny at the point where bad apples take the phone off the hook so it's sending business in other directions. After 11  will the owner please roll up your sleeves and build that quality affordable family restaurant  as we all know it should be Merry Christmas and HAPPY NEW YEAR EVERYONE< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Honestly for once I can tell you that Denny's coffee really is not bad thanks to this location even at 3 in the morning or actually was surprisingly really good!

I've been coming here since high school. No matter where I am in the United States, it's comforting to know it's there, it's just like going home. For those of you who complain about it, knock it off. It's Denny's for crying out loud. It's not supposed to be a Michelin Star level restaurant! It's about the Grand Slam, pancakes, Hot Fudge Sundaes, and the great coffee... not to mention friends and a comfortable place to relax and reminisce.  It fits those requirements perfectly!< /Review>

I almost gave up on Dennis until I ate at the one in Santa Clara I was so impressed on the clean restaurant and restroom, i eaten at a lot of Denny's    and this one is the best and the friendly staff. I was seated in 2 minutes eating in 15 minutes not like the one on Berryessa it takes 10 to 20 minutes to be seated and  you get your food about 45 to 1 hr after getting there even when the restaurant is only half full.< /review>

<text>The food here is on par with a Denny's. There is nothing special about this location. Outside this location often smells of ammonia. Other than that, no complaints. The restaurant usually has a friendly front desk staff and is generally clean.</text>< Pictures>

Best place to grab a late night munch, affordable price range but heavily accented Spanish staff makes communication bit difficult sometimes.< /Text>

So I ordered by phone, it was a bit frustrating cause the guy couldn't understand what I wanted (English was definitely not his first language), and he messed up my order a little bit but still tasted amazing so it's not a big deal! Love this place and will keep coming <3<//review>

Leticia is a horrible"manager". Didn't honor my discount card. Said she'd be firing the manager that did honor it. Was rude. She has no management experience at all! Left a voicemail for the CEO,but never heard back from.him either</Review>

It was sooo nasty, I don't eat raw yolk. when they brought my plate, they didn't bring my husbands and they took a while to bring it.  Also they took forever to bring a refill of water. We talked to manager and she did not say anything else than an "ok". I was expecting an ok service but this time service was horrible.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>Went to Dennys today and was treated by the worse service I've had at a restaurant. Ask for the manager and she was just as rude. Ask for her name and she said it was against policy to give her name and she didn't even have a name tag. The servers name was Naveli H.
It's just to bad when you give your hard working money for breakfast and you get treated this way.
I know one thing, Dennys has lost a customer for life and I'll be sure to share this on social media so that my friend and family won't have to be treated this way. Buyer beware they have no idea of the term " customer service".< /Review>< pictures>

Very bad service. Unapologetic about it too! Food took 35 minutes to arrive that too after I asked them to check on it. And the food was cold! I had asked for pancakes, sausages and eggs - nothing out of the ordinary.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Thank you very much for your work and effort.
It is very nice to order your breakfast and that your pancakes are so fluffy, that it looks like a piece of cake.
Thank you very much to the kitchen workers.
