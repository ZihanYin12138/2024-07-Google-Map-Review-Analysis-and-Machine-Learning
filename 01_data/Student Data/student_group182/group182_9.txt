I was in today for a facial, but the esthetician did not even introduce herself. She did a great job but did not even provide any feedback or recommendations for a follow up treatment!<//Review>

I have been watching this business explode exponentially because of the exceptional service provided not only by the staff but especially by nurse Shawnda. I am a trans female that needed more enhancement for my femininity.  Shawnda detailed the pros and cons of the dermal filler‘s I was about to get. She administered these fillers gracefully and almost pain-free. So far, and it’s only been a few days, I’ve been ecstatic with the results! This business can perform a variety of cosmetic procedures to make a more beautiful you.  Highly recommended!!!<//text>

This review is for me AND my mom but she doesn't have an email lol 😁 she only speaks Spanish and was so comfortable with the ladies there that serviced her in Spanish!

Immediately after the facial I had supple hydrated skin and cleared pores. Sylvia knew I was worried about my first time getting a peel. She made sure I was aware of what was happening the whole time. Everyone I met there was kind and knowledgeable. Treat yourself girl! I approve. Thanks girls!</Text>< Pictures>

Shawnda and the staff at Beauty Lounge are FABULOUS!!! Very personable and knowledgeable.

I recently had the Tear trough filler done. I could see results instantaneously.  Tear trough helped plump up an area that became damaged from a previous injection(different provider). Helped minimize the dark under eye circles.  I had tons of complaints about looking more rested, vibrant.

Yes, I did end up with a couple small bruises, easily covered with cover up.  Overall am absolutely happy with the fillers!! I look forward to having many more services with Beauty Lounge!!<//review>

WOW! I seriously cannot put words to how much I love this med spa! Beauty Lounge babes took care of me so well and made me look and feel beautiful. I had a terrible double chin so I got the Diamond Polar Facial tightening done. In just a few session my double chin was bye bye. I will def be going back soon for more treatments.< /Review>

The team there was welcoming from the minute I walked through the door. Shawnda was so knowledgeable about the procedure and made sure that I was comfortable the whole time.

<Text>I went into the beauty lounge for an IPL photofacial to treat some existing scarring on my face. The service was amazing and Nurse Shawnda was awesome at educating me through the process so I’d know what to expect. My skin 1 week post treatment is visibly more even in tone and texture and most of my scarring has faded if not gone completely away. Will definitely be back!< /Text>< pictures>

This place is outstanding! Shawnda, the owner really knows what she is doing and pays attention to detail. She really listen to my concerns and my expectations and would explain the procedure and what I should expect. I love the fact that not only is she knowledgeable about permanent makeup but that she is a registered nurse herself preforming the procedures. I cannot wait to go back to her for my future permanent makeup needs.</text>

First off, the decor inside is super cute and welcoming! Staff was very kind and understanding that it was my first ever Hydrafacial. Beauty Lounge provided a private and comforting room for the facial. The ambiance was really relaxing. She walked me through the process before even starting, so I knew exactly what to expect. She also explained what she was doing while she was doing it. And girl! did it feel amazing!? Heck yah!! My skin felt like it had been touched by an angel for days after! Pores so clean and minimized! 100% recommend Beauty Lounge Permanent Makeup & Med Spa!!!< /Review>

This place is truly a gem in Southern California. I had three services done- a henna brow, lash lift, and lip flip. All three came out flawless. The lash lift with Sylvia has been a game changer for me, taking out lots of makeup time during the day and they have grown at a faster rate than I’ve ever noticed before, much better investment than classic eyelash extensions.   My brows are another area I’m skeptical to let people touch, and I was not disappointed - the henna brow lasted 2 weeks, that’s two weeks of not having to touch my brows without committing to anything permanent, trust me you need to try! The lip flip by Shawnda was also a perfect alternative to me not being ready for filler yet, but to enhance my natural upper lip pout giving it more fullness and volume. I learned so much from this place apart from any other med spa, and I love that there are services for every step on the way.From the moment you walk in you feel like you are a million bucks just by the elegance of the place before the staff even works their magic. I enjoyed this experience, the professional staff, relaxing environment and most importantly was so pleased with my results! Amazing prices for luxury service, I wouldn’t trust any other med spa with my face after going to Beauty Lounge!! 💫</Text>

I explained to Viki exactly how I wanted my eyebrows to look...and she made them come out even better than I could ever have imagined! I really want her to do the microblading permanent eyebrows for me, but I need to get over my fear of it.

Absolutely obsessed with this place. One stop beauty shop. They offer so many different treatments. I’ve now had a PRP/microneedling facial, a hydra facial and tear trough filler. I’ve never had this glowy of skin in my life! You can tell that everyone that works there takes a lot of pride in what they do. The girls go above and beyond for their clients. They’re also super fun to chat with! I’d absolutely recommend this place to all my friends! I’m excited to continue getting treatments. It’s nice to have finally found a place I can trust for all my beauty needs. ❤️</Review>

I recently moved here from L.A. and I needed a new go-to gal for all of my beauty needs. I found Shawnda and the Beauty Lounge through a recommendation from a friend. Her Botox prices are so competitive, and it is the best deal I have found in San Diego. Not only that, she was so good at doing it, it didn't hurt and I found that it lasted longer than it usually does. I will be going back to her and would absolutely recommended her to anyone reading this debating if they should go or not!<//text>

<review>Hey friends!
I just wanted to share with you my journey today with Dr. Shawna!
@beautyloungesanmarcos
She is kind, friendly, understanding, and her stories are so relatable and funny. I instantly felt comfortable!
The procedure that she helped me with today was Laser Hair Removal on the arms pits.
She explained everything and made sure I knew what she was doing and the meaning and differences of each brand/products. Everything was smooth and painless! Thank you so much!!
She’s also really pretty. 😍
A big shout out to @chauntelelovelyne for this opportunity to meet Dr.Shawna!<//review></record></dataset><record>

I went in with high expectations (for brow microblading) and was NOT disappointed. The results surpassed my expectations, actually. She worked with me, listened to my details and requests, and showed me a demo before doing the procedure. Shawnda is a true artist! So happy with this place and the employees.<//text>

<date>1574196285204<//date><Rate>5< /Rate><review>My very first visit was for a Botox update on forehead, eyes and bunny lines. I absolutely loved Shawnda. She explained the procedure and discussed all of the expectations for during and post procedure. It did not hurt at all and I had no bruising which is usually never the case for me.

I later decided to have my tear troughs filled. I have had the procedure done twice before - first time with a VERY famous Beverly Hills doctor that is known for his lip work on a VERY famous cosmetics company owner who is known specifically for her lips. The last time I had this done I had to return for several follow up visits because if you don't know your eye area is very thin and deciding to have this procedure I hope you will do your homework and not expect a one visit miracle. Due to the fact that you are working in such a delicate area, it may take several visits to get the balance you need between eyes and cheek. Luckily, I only required the one visit. I was impressed once again that I had almost no bruising and loved my results with just the first visit.

Next up, I signed up for the Hydra facials. Love love love love love. Do yourself a favor and just get it done as a treat to yourself. You can never have enough hydration living in San Diego! My Esthetician for the facials was an absolute pleasure to visit with and also was so in depth about the procedure and expectations. I will be doing this again and again.

Most recently, I am having the Diamond Polar treatment on my neck for sagging jowls and what looks like a gobble gobble, loose skin. I hate it. I signed up for ten sessions and currently half way through my treatment. I absolutely love the way the treatment feels on my skin each week. It is so relaxing and to be honest...I would pay just to go spend that time with Marissa. If you have not met her yet  - you are truly missing out. She is beyond precious and THE MOST CARING EVER. Love love love her! I really can't post just yet about my final results but I will once I am done. I have already noticed some firming up but I also feel like I am a realist in knowing I still might need some Kybella also.

I would like to just give a great big shout out to Linda who has patiently put up with me having to reschedule and schedule last minute appointments. She is always such a sweetheart on the phone and via emails. I so appreciate that I can just email, text or call and boom they are always responsive to get me in as soon as possible when I have a need.

I want to urge all of you out there to please understand just how lucky you are to have such a talented, caring team here in San Marcos/North County. I have had soooo many cosmetic surgeries and procedures in the past - all over the country. I could do just about anywhere and willing to pay any price (and have) but I love the way these girls make me feel. I know them, I know there struggles and how absolutely hard they work. I have followed them on social media since my very first visit. They are real people and even in San Marcos, they make me feel like I am back in my small town Texas!

Through out my year as a client, I have witnessed all to often others taking extreme advantage of these sweet girls. From flat out theft, to scamming services and not paying and then the overall customers no showing appointments. My mom was a hairdresser growing up so I know the importance of schedules and not being a jerk to others. Everyone of these girls have families...I beg you...please keep your appointments with them! They are busy and they make a choice to take time to help make us all feel better about our looks. The least we can do is be KIND and THOUGHTFUL when booking their time.

Lastly, Shawnda is very talented and I absolutely trust her completely at this point. She is very professional and works so hard to make sure her clients are completely satisfied. Again, I have treated all over the US with full fledged cosmetic surgeons. Be thankful you have these girls locally!<//review>< Pictures>

As reflected in the attached photos of our conversation. We offered to reprocess your lashes and reapply a different color henna brow which you refused. Both services were expertly performed with great results as evident in the photos. Our products and employee time were used to provide your treatment and their was no evidence of negligence our fault for your lash lift and brow henna. You simply did not like the final result and choose to take the opinions of a subway employee who makes sandwiches all day in lieu of  your professional brow artsiest. Viki has over 10 years experience in the beauty industry, threading, and with permanent makeup. She is an expert at her craft.\n\nIt is not our business practice to issue refunds for wonderful expertly performed service like you received. We offered a solution you refused and continued to harass and threaten us into the late hours of the night. Hence taking the course of action to ban you from our page.\n\nAdditionally, as you could see at our location we are full service medical spa and not a one woman show. It is a bit presumptuous to assume that our Registered Nurse Shawnda would be performing your brow henna. She is the Lead Practitioner/Registered Nurse and lead Cosmetic Tattooist as well as the business owner and soley performs medical procedures and permanent makeup.\n\nWe stand by our work and still invite you in to reprocess your lashes and try a different brow henna color. Despite the already completed wonderful work and threats and harassment.\n\nTeam Beauty Lounge\n\nPHOTOS AVAILABLE IN OUR PHOTOS SECTION OF OUR INTERACTIONS, CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CLIENT AS WELL AS COMPLIMENTS RECEIVED ON IG ABOUT HER BROWS!'}<//Resp>< user>

Vicky was the one that did mine. DO NOT GO WITH HER! if you don't want your eyebrow to be ruined! I had people at store said they looked bad. I don't believe she knows what she is doing. My eyebrows were way off. I contacted them but I was blocked! People don't waste your money here. I'm pretty sure there's alot other better locations with a good quality of work....</Review></record></dataset><record>

My dermaplaning facial everything and more! It was my first visit and the staff was very welcoming and friendly. They got me checked in and set up within 5 minutes. During my facial my esthetician explained the whole process and educated me on every part of it. My skin came out glowing and so soft! I can’t wait for my next service!</Text>

Had a hydrafacial done by Katie and Fillers done by Shaunda. The facial left my skin smooth and glowing, very relaxing atmosphere. I got fillers done on my chin and nose and I absolutely love the results! Wasn’t too painful and Shaunda made me feel very comfortable. I definitely recommend this place.< /review>

The staff were very friendly women, it's like they've known you forever they're so easy to get comfy with! We were so shocked to see how well my teeth had taken to the whitening!!!! I was lucky enough to have such amazing results!! Results were so good my husband couldn't believe it and had to schedule himself a session too lol. I'm in love with the results and I cant wait to come again to get them even more whiter! So pleased with my experience here, I highly recommend Beauty Lounge!!!

< Review>
Nurse Shawnda is great! I stopped by to get fillers, one syringe of Voluma. We used half on my upper lip and the other half on my chin. She gave me natural and subtle results which is exactly what I wanted! It’s only been one day and I’m still swollen but so far I couldn’t be happier. The office itself however could use some improvement. There seems to be little communication among staff which led to a lot of misunderstandings and everyone not being on the same page. They’re also in the process of switching operating systems so it made things worse. But things like this will improve with time. Definitely stop in and give them a chance to impress you!

8/23/19 Update:
In response to the reply from business:

I apologize if I came off passive aggressive. That was not my intention at all. I was just trying to leave an honest review- that I found Dr. Shawnda's work to be great, but there were other aspects about the business that made the visit unpleasant. I was not trying to go into too much detail, but now I need to address some of the misunderstandings you brought up in your reply to my review.

1. I never once 'assumed' I would be getting a complimentary service. I only knew the spa was providing comped services because a few of my friends were receiving them. So instead of 'assuming', I decided to "engage" with their account. I directly messaged/ asked the official beautyloungesanmarcos instagram page if they were willing to work out a similar deal with me. (screenshots of conversation attached)
2. If they did not want to comp me anything, that is perfectly fine. I would've understood. They could've said no, but they NEVER once did. So I continue to book an appointment.
3. Whenever I would call in, I would ask for Marissa who I was told was in charge of influencer bookings; even in my voicemails I would say I was calling for Marissa. When I had to reply to Nurse Shawnda via email, I even included a PDF of my Instagram messages just to make sure we were all on the same page before I showed up for my appointment.
3. When I show up, Marissa claims that were was no previous conversation between me and the instagram page and she doesn't know who was on their instagram page talking to me and authorizing the service. I found it odd that the business was not aware of who was talking to me via their instagram- which is what I meant in my initial review that there seemed  to be little communication among staff and no one was on the same page despite me doing my due diligence.
4. I found it all to be very unprofessional that they waited for me to actually show up before they decided to turn me down for the comped service, when they could've turned me down on instagram, on the phone, or even in the emails.
5. However, they did provide a courtesy of offering me a discount on a service (as long as I posted on google review, yelp, social media, etc). I appreciated the offer which is why i still decided to go through with it. Since it was still a service I paid for I felt obigated to write an honest review.
6. Looking back at the messages I can kind of see where the confusion came from. But at the end of the day, if the customer is confused about something, is it completely their fault? I mean they're confused for a  reason- just look at those instagram messages for yourself. Do you agree this was 'clearly a result of the customer's assumption'? Personally I think it is more so the result of the business not being clearer in their responses to the customer.

It is a shame that instead  of using this as a learning  opportunity for the business to have better communication among staff members and to better streamline their influencer booking processes, they took the review personally & tried to fault the customer. Despite this leaving a bad taste in my mouth,I truly hope this business the best.< /Review>

<resp>{'time': 1566575392007, 'text': 'Hi Melanie thanks for the review and we are so glad you liked the results of your procedure. Yes we are upgrading our booking software and you unintentionally recieved all the consent forms due to a technical programming error in the software we have since remedied. As for the “little communication among staff” that was clearly a result of your assumption you were going to be comp’d as an influencer and you self scheduling an appointment that was not authorized or coordinated with the Spa Director in charge of the influencer program. These agreements are pre-negotiated with certain criterion in place and contracts written, and approved by the owner.\nAs a courtesy to you even though you ASSUMED we would give you complimentary services we offered you a generous discount on product, despite you not fitting the prerequisites of our influencer program, and the fact you had never engaged with our accounts let alone follow us on any of our platforms. It’s a shame that you felt a need to be so passive aggressive in your above statements.'}< /resp>< user_name>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Wow!! My experience with Shawnda was absolutely amazing. I received a HydraFacial & Laser hair removal. First off I’m such a chicken to pain.  Shawnda could tell i was very nervous about the laser removal. She was extremely patient. She walked me through each step , asked about my concerns and put me at ease.
Her customer service is truly one of a kind!!!
If you're looking for a beauty lounge who is all about their clients this is your place.
I couldn't imagine why I've ever settled for less nor will i ever after my visit!
Believe me, Don't hesitate this is your place!
Thanks so much shawnda! Can’t wait for my next treatment.<//review>< pics>

Best place in north county! Shawnda did my microblading 2 years ago and still looks good. Nurse Shawnda also did my lip filler with juvaderm. Didn't even bruise. Had the dermaplaning facial with sylvia and my skin felt like butter. So relaxing. The spa is super cute! You have to take a selfie on the pink couch! The team greets you with a glass of champagne! Great experience I'll be back.< /review>

<Review>There is now a "requirement" for all visitors to wear masks. And now there is someone telling vendors who they may sell to and who they may not sell to. Since when can farmers be dictated to. This is not caution. It is a kind of tyranny we are to be protected FROM.</Review>< Pictures>

<review>Personally, I feel this is one of the best farmer's market in the area. No food trucks. No arts and crafts. Just plenty of farmer's selling their amazing produce. There are enough farmers that you can find the same produce at multiple farmer's without fighting a huge crowd.<//review>< Pics>

It's convenient for me, and while there are FAR less vendors than the huge Sunday Market that's downtown, I can always get the in-season produce that I'm looking for, and at amazingly low prices!!

So many good wholesome foods to choose from. From nuts, honey, apples, and a huge assortment of vegetables and fruits. Walk through at your pleasure good pricing for your money! Bring your recycled bag with handles, so you can fill it/them up to the top.< /Review>

It's amazing what deals you can find here. The grocery stores will be selling 2 ears of corn for a dollar and here you can get 3 or 4 ears for a dollar for example.<//Review>

Sales rep. Brandon never tells the truth! They have you pd in advance for charging, several times I have dropped off my cell/bk-up charger. Only to find that nothing was charged @ all & refuse to return my $$. Another time I brought a blue tooth speaker"JBL clip" charged me $80. Found out that wk they r only $49.99 @ Wal-Mart!! Again refused to return my $$  or work something out for the over charge$!! No I would highly recommend that everyone stay away from that Metro PCS!
Oh if you're a good client & have been with metropcs for a couple of yrs, your can get an up-grade! Haaah right? Nope it's the same price you see on the phones currently being sold to all new customers! What?< /Review>

Dr. Brenis is a bright, engaging, professional who can speak and relate the medical terms of a situation that actually makes sense. You get the feeling that he truly cares about your ailment and wants to do all in his power to provide a plan for a complete and healthy recovery. I would also like to add that his office staff is kind, helpful, cheerful and positive.</Text>

< Review>
The staff in Watsonville are exceptional...cheerful, very helpful and a joy to see, and to talk to on the phone. Dr. Brenis is a wonderful Dr. He has a great personality, loads of experience he draws on, examples of people with like issues doing well as well as a down-to-earth approach that is honest and friendly as well as competent and creative. I have not had any surgical procedures done by Dr Brenis so I can't comment on that.</Review>

The receptionist was very friendly. I was running late, they said no worries, we'll see you when you get here. I was greeted and told that yes, traffic is horrible at this time. The doctor was great! She saw me, asked what I wanted to do, gave me some options, and then boom, appointment over. Toe fixed and follow up appointment made. Super easy super friendly! Thanks !</Text>

Had to have an ingrown toenail removed.  I recommend the doctor use the numbing spray before administering shots to ease the pain.  Other than that, my experience was a good one.</review>

Nice place to stop by for a quiet dinner.  Family owned.  Friendly service.  Wanted the paella, but I was told it would take a long time to cook.  Paella needs to be called in ahead of time to avoid waiting in the restaurant.  Keep that in mind if that's what you want.  I had the seafood rice dish instead, very tasty.</Review>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>The ideal place to eat is one where the person or persons spending to eat there, can and will get the very illusive money’s worth from the place. Delicias Peruanas seem to comprehend how important is this concept. A family operation in the full sense of the word, they served us two delicious ceviche mixtos ($12 each?) and a very good looking fried fish with rice and fresh salsa ($14?), which one of my lovely female companions ate in its entirety. Also the special of the day for $8.50 which included a drink 🥃 (strawberry water cold), a home made soup, and a chicken stew (Peruvian style). Prices are average for the area, and the food very well made. The lovely female owner/operator was a delight, efficient and courteous. The father and son team (father main cook) completed this well oiled team. Yes, we paid around $58 with gratuity, but we left satisfied, and at the end of the day, isn’t that what is all about? 4 Stars.<//Text>< Pics>

Kind of hole-in-the-wall place for Peruvian fare in Lake Forest, not some fancy diner for trendy people. It's the kind of place where people go to savor food that they grew up with, prepared in as close a possible to grandma's cooking. The paella is prepared differently compared to the Spanish or Mexican version, garnished with a different set of herbs. The chicken grilled with the flatiron is something to behold, so tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. If you are adventurous, they offer grilled cow heart for your taking. Parking is free. Accepts all major credit cards except American Express.<//review>

Good Peruvian place run by friendly Japanese Peruvians.  Food feels authentic and is tasty.  They close a bit early and if you go within half hour of closing they turn off the parilla so part of their menu is unavailable.< /Review>

<text>I’ve been going here for MANY years and as a Peruvian, I have to say it is the most delicious and authentic Peruvian food around. The lomo saltado is to die for!!! Plus the take out is amazing, they serve you just as much as if you were eating at the restaurant. Highly recommend. You will not be disappointed!</text><UserId.>112840625107776990369< /UserId.></record>

I love this place.  The service is always excellent, and the food is always so tasty.  I'm a huge fan of their churrasco NY steak with chimichurri, but really its hard to go wrong here.  I highly recommend this place over any of the chain peruvian restaurants,</Review>

I really loved this place. I've tried the Jalea, Lomo Saltado, and Tallarin de Pollo. They were all really good and the food was really fresh.
It is a smaller place so not very accommodating to bigger parties, but it is a great place to go eat dinner or lunch any day of the week. This is real quality Peruvian food!</Review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Delicias Peruanas is a family-operated Peruvian restaurant in Lake Forest. The family is Japanese-Peruvian, with father in the kitchen, mother behind the counter, and son as the sever. Japanese and Peruvian may sound like an unusual combination, but Japanese-Peruvians represent 0.3% of the population in Peru. During the Sino-Japanese War in the late 1800's, the economy of Japan suffered and it produced a surplus of local farmers. Peru welcomed the immigration of hard working Japanese farmers. These Japanese immigrants combined their native recipes with Peru's favorable fishing environment and the rice imported by the Spanish, giving rise to unique Japanese-inspired-Peruvian dishes prepared with novel cooking styles (Nikkei cuisine).

Although the chef and son at Delicias Peruanas have Japanese blood and possess an Asian appearance, they speak fluent Spanish. The chef cooks authentic Peruvian dishes (with Asian flair) and the server Roberto is competent in describing the differences in each dish.

During lunch, a $8 special is available, which is affordable given that it consists of a selection among 4 Peruvian-inspired entrees with generous portion, a soup/salad, a citrus concentrate beverage, and bread with aji sauce. For a light eater, this can be equivalent to two meals.

The soup was similar to a garden vegetable soup but also resembled a clear version of an Italian minestrone. Zucchini, celery, cabbage, lima beans, and cilantro were found. The bread was standard but the spicy aji sauce was remarkable. The citrus beverage was a refreshing juice with passion fruit flavors, appropriate for the summertime.

The main course that I ordered was the estofado de pollo. Two pieces of tender chicken (thigh and leg) were garnished with pepper, herbs, and mild spices. The chicken was placed in a thin tomato sauce and served over a bed of rice, two pieces of potato, and sliced red onions. I recommend this dish to those who prefer wet food since estofado de pollo is a chicken stew over rice. For those who prefer dry food, I recommend the pescado frito (pan fried tilapia) dish available on the lunch special menu. The dishes are not fully representative of traditional Peruvian cuisine, it's fits the Peruvian-American fusion tastes.

While I waited for my lunch, I observed the kitchen and discovered that the chef cooking with an open fire and a flambe technique. I don't think every dish is prepared this way, but it was quite a sight to see the chef hold a small pan engulfed with 3' high flames!

Delicias Peruanas is no longer a hidden hole in the wall. Word has gotten out about this gem in Lake Forest, so don't be surprised to encounter a lunch crowd. I am eager to return soon and try the other $8 lunch specials.</Review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) Small, clean and simple the place where Delicias Peruanas works, its food is quite acceptable in flavor and its good presentation, the abundance of its dishes requires you to have enough appetite or the option to take what you can not eat in the local you can help, they do not have permission to sell beers, so you will have to accompany the food with juice of parchita, chicha morada, lemonade or Peruvian soda incacola.

(Original)
Pequeño, limpio y sencillo el local donde funciona Delicias Peruanas, su comida es bastante aceptable en sabor y su presentacion buena, lo  abundante de sus  platos te exige tener bastante apetito o la opción de para llevar lo que no puedes comer en el local te puede ayudar, no tienen permiso para vender cervezas, por lo que tendrás que acompañar la comida con jugo de parchita , chicha morada,limonada o la soda peruana  incacola.<//review>

<review>Good Afternoon,
This was one of the nicest experiences I've had in a long long time. I was greeted promptly but not over bearing. I had done my research and knew what I was looking for. The salesman listened to us, showed us our options and we are actually out the door in 45 minutes we our new mattress. I would recommend Mattress Firm to everyone. Thank you. We've been waiting for this for a long time.<//review><Time>1619302277972</Time><gmap_id>0x809107426cdeec6b:0xb972cf8bb86977bc</gmap_id>< user_name>

Patrick at the Turlock store was very knowledgeable about all the different ones. Even then it was still confusing. I knew what type I was looking for. He was helpful steering me to the right one.   I asked for his best offer and if there was a discount for my husband’s military service.  It was nice to work with him and did not feel like I was pressured.</Text>< Pics>

<text>The dudes who work there were genuinely friendly and helpful and had good senses of humor, which was helpful because shopping and talking to people can be stressful for me. The mattress I bought is comfortable and has been great for me so far. I ordered the mattress to be delivered to my house and it arrived on the day they said it would (which I appreciate greatly, 'cause it's not always the case with some places). An entirely positive experience!<//text><date>1607236132175<//date>< rate>

Mes was very kind and helpful.  After going to multiple store trying to find the right mattress, Mes was able to guide me to a comparable mattress for a fraction of the price!  Not only did I get an amazing mattress for a significantly reduced price, but he also threw in a box spring and their gold service delivery for free!  I am still amazed at his kindness and eagerness to help us find the perfect mattress to fit both my husband’s and I’s needs.  I strongly recommend making this your first stop when mattress shopping!< /text>

I’m thankful he took the time to walk us through and point out each mattress and what it was good for. We ended up buying a mattress and got a great deal with an adjustable frame to it, to be delivered the next day! We recommend this place to anyone.< /Review>< Resp>

I was desperately in need of a new mattress and had a wonderful experience working with Mesfin from the Monte Vista store. He was very informative and explained all the pros and cons of each mattress I tried. At no point did I feel pressured into purchasing as I went back several days to make sure I was certain on my purchase. They have a great variety of products and you are guaranteed to find something! I will continue to shop at this store anytime it’s time to replace my mattress.<//review>

<Review>I was pleased with the interaction of the Mattress Firm sale associate. I was there for a specific reason and was not harassed to buy anything other than what I was looking for a set of king size sheets. He was friendly, helpful and courteous.

Customer service is almost more important than the product itself. The moment my wife and I walked into Mattress Firm in Turlock, CA (Target Shopping Center), Mes was absolutely incredible. Mes, took his time educating us and demonstrating products he knew–based on our feedback–we would love. He was careful to explain the “why” and allowed us to experience each mattress until we found the right one.

I’m a firm believer one’s encounter with a sales person should never feel like you’re talking to a “sales person” but rather someone who is attentive, who leads with empathy, and is compassionate. Mes was able to pair us with a product that will enrich our life for years to come. His attention to my detail was uncanny. When I thought I had everything I needed, Mes showed me how I could further enhance my sleep with an adjustable base.

My wife and I left to discuss our investment and returned a few days later fully confident of or purchase, but unequivocally resolute in Mes. He had our best interest at heart. By the time it was all said and done, I wanted to take Mes out for dinner to express our gratitude.

I cannot speak more highly of Mes and the quality of service he delivered. Thank you so much!<//text>

Mes was extremely helpful and not pushy in anyway.
He made finding a new mattress an enjoyable experience rather than
it feeling like a chore. I would absolutely recommend anyone looking for a
new mattress go visit Mes!</Review>

The employees are extremely friendly and knowledgeable. They aren’t pushy either. It was nice to not feel pressured into buying the most expensive bed or even a bed we didn’t want.</Review>

The manager (Patrick)  was very knowledgable about all the differences between the matress'. Very nice and helpful.  During this Covid time he and his staff took very good care of us with all the protocols in place. We will definitely purchase our next matress from them!< /Text>

My wife and I were mattress shopping and were not having the best experience... prices too high, salespeople who were less than convincing, etc. We stopped at Mattress Firm and the salesman/manager ( Mes) was terrific. He was very knowledgeable and patient. He took the time to ask us the right questions and got us the perfect mattress for our preferences and budget! Thanks Mes! And thanks Mattress Firm!<//review>

I was texting with Jeanette using the online chat and she was amazing helped me pick out what I needed by the information I gave her of what I asked for. Found a location near me that I could go and see the mattress before ordering went to the store checked it out and purchased it

It gets delivered tomorrow.

Thank you for the great service.<//review>

Had the best experience with the sales gentleman helping us, Mesfin Abate. He was very informative and knowledgeable; after listening to our wants/needs he guided us in the best direction for our perfect fit, couldn’t be happier and more comfortable with my decision of coming here, would definitely buy from again.< /text>

Walked in to Turlock’s Mattress firm only to see Mesfin Abate (Stores manager) in there alone while there were more customers than him. However he was very kind and able to assist me in the look of a King sized mattress. Even was able to find me one on clearance/sale, making it easier for me financially. All while also getting it delivered straight to my house out in Newman, hands down a great experience and Mesfin will do whatever he can to help you.<//Review>

Just had surgery and needed an adjustable base to lift my head and feet ASAP. Mesfin Abate thoroughly explained the pros and cons with each base which allowed me to make a more educated purchase. Shopping with Mesfin was a pleasant experience and I will definitely see him again when I’m ready for a new mattress.</Review>

Manger is very knowledgeable & helpful.  He didn't try to rush you, he said to take as much time as you need, since buying a bed is a big decision.  Also, he had a great personality.< /review>

<Text>The staff was knowledgable and curious. Talked with Justin and took full advantage of the labor day sale. I ended up saving $1200. 0% financing for 72 months. Best way to buy a bed.<//Text>< Pics>

Mesfin was amazing!! Me and my fiancé went here to buy our first mattress together and we had many questions.  Luckily the manager himself took care of us personally.  He wasn’t pushy at all on trying to get a high end sale.  He got us the perfect mattress that fit what we could afford.  Will definitely recommend and will be coming back in the future.< /Text>

Mesfin, who is the manager at this store was so great at answering all my questions about warranties, type of bed, and so on. He is well informed on all the products that they carry and he simply knows his stuff. I was so pleased at the quality of service that I received from him and I am beyond happy with my Bed Purchase. Not only do I highly recommend going to this Mattress Firm in the Target plaza but speed the man "Mesfin" . Again thank you and will definitely be doing more business here in the future.</Review>< Response>

<Date>1558935026899</Date><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>I purchased my mattress from Mattress Firm a little over a year ago (original review below) and I wanted to upgrade my pillows. I initial bought some cheap pillows off of Amazon when I purchased my bed and now a year later and the pillows are lumpy and causing me some discomfort in my neck. I decided it was time to invest in some good quality pillows, so I reached out to Mesfin who was still with the company (thank God!) and he advised me that I should come into the store during their Memorial Day Sale to test out some options.

Mesfin educated me on the importance of a good pillow. He had me test out several pillows, on the exact make and model of the bed that I initial purchased from Mattress Firm, so that I could see how the pillow felt on top of my actual bed! Who would have thought that, that was a thing?!! Makes sense though when you think about it.

I purchased 2 great pillows. I'm so glad that I did not purchase the pillows online and that I took the time to come into the store. I am even more thankful that Mesfin helped me with something so trival as picking out pillows.

Once again, I've had a great experience with Mattress Firm & Mesfin. I will be going back for all my future mattress and of course pillow needs!

Review as of 2/22/18

As a woman I am always leery of being taken advantage of when it comes to things such as getting any work done on my vehicle, or in this case buying a brand-new mattress.  I went to Mattress Firm to do some preliminary research before I made a purchase. I was greeted by the store manager, Mesfin, who was welcoming and personable. He took me around the show room and educated me on each mattress. He was extremely knowledgeable about their selection of mattresses and was very patient with me. I tested each one out and by process of elimination, he helped me find the perfect mattress for me. He took his time and answered all my questions, he really exceeded all my expectations. When I was finally ready to make my purchase 2 weeks later, he even helped me get financing!  Overall, I had a pleasant experience, Mesfin took the nervousness and anxiety out of making such a huge purchase.</Text>< pics>

Mesfin was so amazing! He was occupied when we walked in the door but approached us to let us know he would be with us shortly because he was tied up. He was very informative. It was a first time purchase for us as a married couple and he supplied so much intel on mattresses that we had no clue of. We bought our bed and will definitely be back to buy the kids new mattresses as well. Thank you so much Mattress Firm in Turlock!!!!</Review>

<review>I walk into Twelve Bridges and you could not see the smiles because of the masks but you know they were there. The staff was very friendly and i sat down and SHORTLY after someone cane and took me back. The wait time was very short between checkin and actually going back. The staff showed me around the office. The most important thing that happened was that gave me my confidence back and I’m able to smile 😃 with a big grind again thank you twelve bridges.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1621273575475, 'text': 'Keep Smiling!'}< /Resp><GmapID>0x809b22eb64e7dba1:0xa0bc4f743cde27e1<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Start to finish had a great experience. I have been going to Twelve Bridges dental for a few years now and hadn’t been since Covid started. My visit today was very good and of the highest level of service. My hygienist made the experience very seem less.</Review>

The best dental place I’ve ever been. Both dr Zanzi’s are fantastic and very amazing at what they do. They’ve got my 4 year old wanting to be a dentist now. Thank you so much Twelve Bridges dental!<//Review>

I had been going to Twelve Bridges Dental for around 2 years. Everyone is always friendly and professional. The doctors explain everything they’re going to do up front and give you advice on how to better take care of your teeth in the future. The offices are always very clean. Every experience I’ve had has been nothing short of great and I always look forward to going back. I highly recommend Twelve Bridges Dental.
We love to go every time doing cleaning or treatments our teeth.<//Review>

My family and I LOVE this dental office!! Their dentists are all amazing and they also have a peds dentist for youth, which my kids enjoy seeing as well.  They say it all starts with the front office staff, and if that's the case,  you won't be disappointed!! They've been nothing short of fantastic every time I've called and extremely accommodating and understanding with my mother-in-law, who's dealing with dementia. I could go on and on...  I would definitely recommend this office to my friends and family, which I already have, as I know with confidence..they'd be treated well and that they'd be in good hands.</text>

<text>My visit went surprisingly well as I am not a dentist fan. The girls were friendly accommodating and compassionate toward my fears. The hygienist did an awesome job cleaning my teeth with little to no discomfort. I broke a tooth and needed it fixed ......well because that always seems to happen to me ( lucky me ) but the dentist was very friendly and gentle and did a great job at masking the pain of a shot (barely hurt) and my tooth is fixed so all good.</text><pics>None<//pics><response>{'time': 1609963894727, 'text': 'Glad everything went well for you .Thank you'}< /response><GmapID>0x809b22eb64e7dba1:0xa0bc4f743cde27e1< /GmapID></record>

I originally visited this past fall for an annual dental cleaning, which I was a little hesitant to do given the current health climate (COVID-19), but the office and staff implemented every safety measure you can think of which eased my worries.

After an extremely thorough yet gentle cleaning, I meet with Dr. Raj Zanzi. Dr. Raj was all-around great to chat with. He didn't rush through the appointment and answered all my questions about additional dental work.

I left the Twelve Bridges office so pleased, I decided to return for additional dental work - and Invisalign treatment! If you're looking for a new dentist in the Roseville area no need to look further.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

My family and I have been consistent patients for a number of years. We appreciate the professional, yet warm and hospitable dental care provided. During the Shelter-In-Place changes there were consistent updates keeping the clients informed concerning changes. My first appointment went very well and any questions I had were answered. Everything was in place to ensure the comfort and safety of clients and staff.  They did not miss a beat! Thank you!< /Review>

My own care was excellent, but I was even more thrilled about the service and care of my young son. It was his first time going to the dentist (and my first time taking my kid). We were both set at ease as they made him comfortable and treated him with gentleness and kindness. I didn’t realize at the time what a great experience it was and how kid- and family-friendly Twelve Bridges is, but we’ve since moved out of state and we haven’t found care as good as we had there!</review><Time>1583377875081<//Time><Name>Christina Menges<//Name>< Rating>

<Text>I had missed my appt because I was under impression it was scheduled for next day and they scheduled for same day , I got message saying thank you for scheduling your appt no date or time was specified. So I thought I still gonna have confirmation message. Instead I’m getting a call I missed my appt while I have my newborn just fell asleep. They told me they can see me in 30 min which I had to find babysitter drop him off and make to appt on time I told them I need an hr they cancelled and told me I can’t be seen in their office at all because there were previous appt missed. I had no clue about other missed appt. I was pregnant and started to have severe pain in my tooth my husband had made an appt for me and forgot to tell me which made me miss it. But they told me they won’t accept me in their clinic at all.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>After going from dentist to dentist and being treated poorly I have finally found my dentist office that I will stay at. They treated me awesome the moment I called for an appointment, they got me in soon, then they treated me amazing and showed me around the dentist office. They had amazing staff and an amazing Dr. The Dr numbed me and compared to what I am used too , I could barely feel a thing! I am so happy I came here and will definitely will be referring all my family and friends here !</Review><GmapID>0x809b22eb64e7dba1:0xa0bc4f743cde27e1<//GmapID></record>

I came here for the first time in October of last year and was treated extremely well! It was Halloween and everyone was dressed up for the holiday and they made the office nice and festive. All the staff are extremely professional and polite. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a great dentist who care about the patients!<//text>

Twelve Bridges Dental Group has provided a great dental experience for myself and my husband. First of all, we like the Dental Savings Plan in which we participate.  It suits the needs that we have.  The staff, from office staff to oral hygienists to the doctors,  are personable and friendly. They put us at ease on every visit and remember details about us In conversations.  It makes us feel like friends!  Dr. Zanzi makes us feel comfortable whenever we visit.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone!<//review>

Dr Mrs Zanzi and Dr Mr Zanzi do great work and are so kind and friendly, always going out of their way to accommodate any needs and checking to make sure we are well after procedures.
We have had 4 children go to their in-house orthodontist Dr Sanders. He is so great with children and teens; very gentle, kind, and understanding.
From the front office staff to the assistants and the doctors, everyone is so friendly with great communication. They make us feel like family!<//review>< Pictures>

Dr. Zanzi and his staff are incredible. They are always personable, interactive and professional, making your visit as calming and easy as possible. Even when I go in for a simple cleaning, Dr. Zanzi comes in to visit, inspects my teeth, the work he has performed, asks how I'm doing and if I feel any discomfort. He is the best Dentist I have ever had the misfortune to visit. Let's face it, everyone hates the Dentist. Amy, the Hygienist, is an incredible asset to Twelve Bridges Dental. She is, bar none, the best Hygienist that has ever touched my mouth. Keep it up. Your office is the best.</text>

If you have dental anxiety, then this is the dental facility for you - no stress!! Every time I have visited the staff has put me at ease and is always friendly and courteous. Doctor Zanzi is approachable, knowledgeable, and professional, and makes sure that I feel no pain during and after procedures.

I know some people are afraid of going to the dentist, and maybe that's because they did not have a good experience. If that is your case, call Twelve Bridges Dental today and make an appointment. You won't regret it!< /Review>

< review>
Let me start by saying I absolutely dread going to the dentist! I have always been anxious going to the dentist growing up. Genetics have not dealt me a good hand in the teeth department. I tend to have more cavities than the average person. The staff at twelve bridges make it so easy. They were able to fit me in last minute to get a filling done the next day so I wouldn’t dread getting it done for weeks. Dr. Raj was so gentle with the shots and drilling. Constantly checking in on me and making sure I was okay. He also walked me through what exactly he was doing before he did it. And answered all my questions while not making me feel dumb for asking them. I had a little gap on my front teeth that he gave me some options of what could be done and then was able to work on them that same day! Extremely happy with the quality and the care this team has with their patients and as a new mom it’s nice not to have to give a second thought about my dental heath. Thanks Twelve Bridges team!</review>

I feel like each time I visit I am seeing an old friend, always met with hugs and stories about our families.  The Doctors are very gentle with their work and make sure you are always comfortable.   I have referred family and friends and always heard rave reviews.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

I recently relocated and wanted to find a dentist that I could trust for me and my family. Found Twelve Bridges Dental Group online with awesome reviews. Had to check it out. Called them to set up an appt. Their customer service was exceptional, they were really friendly and got me in right away. Went in to see Drs. Raj and Insiya Zanzi to get my teeth done. They were both very knowledgeable, and caring. Their entire team is very helpful and was friendly during my three visits. They are professional, with many years of experience.  Will definitely recommend them to anyone that's looking for a great dentist they could trust and have a great dental experience.<//Review>

<Review>Everyone welcomed me with a warm smile. Their office is very well decorated and very clean. Amy did my cleaning and she did a very thorough and gentle job. She took the time to educate me about proper dental care and about what she was going to help my oral health. Dr. Zanzi came in to check my teeth and did a thorough oral cancer screening and checked for cavities. They eased any fears I had and I will definitely be recommending them to all my friends and family.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

These guys are awesome. I've had some childhood trauma from previous dental visits, and they completely took care of my teeth and also were aware of my nervousness and helped keep me calm by communicating what they were doing through any procedures. I will continue to come here for any dental care I or my family might need. Thanks!<//text>

We have 3 kids in orthodontics, which means we are regularly going to appointments.  We have been very happy with each experience.  All of the staff are professional and friendly.  The office is always impeccable. They take the time to get to know you and also do a great job.

Dr. Sanders has a great gift in taking time for each of his patients. He has a sweet way about him that shows his concern and care for his patients wellbeing as they go through treatment.  He's been a great help to my family as we have faced each challenge my kid's orthodontics case bring.

Recently, my spouse and I received cleanings on separate days. My spouse came home and commented how unusually gentle their cleaning was. I noticed the same thing about my hygienist and asked some questions about who their hygienist was. It turns out we had the same hygenist! We both felt that it was the gentlest cleaning we have had.  We would happily go back to her.<//text>< rating>

I came in on a google search for emergency care for a loose bridge of my 2 front teeth. Dr. Zanzi and his entire staff were kind, gentle and professional. He carefully laid out options for a plan of care. I had a resolution to my problem with a beautiful temporary the next day!! Very happy with the entire experience from the doctor, the hygienist and front office.</Review>

I have been going to Twelve Bridges Dental for many years now and they have always been fantastic. They are flexible with my schedule, always perform the highest quality work, and follow up to make sure everything is going well after a procedure. I would recommend them to anyone looking for a Dentist they can trust and count on.< /Text>

Twelve Bridges Dental is outstanding. It is the best dental office I have ever been to. The staff are all caring, professional, and friendly. My dental hygienist, Kelli, is efficient yet thorough, very knowledgeable, and makes the cleaning experience enjoyable. Dr. Zanzi provides excellent quality of care. The facility is very modern, with a cheerful atmosphere and the latest in dental technology. I highly recommend this office for your dental needs.</Review>

This was my first visit to Twelve Bridges Dental.   I was warmly greeted by the staff.   Shortly thereafter Amy, my hygienist introduced herself and gave me a brief tour. Once she had me comfortably situated,  she began the process of xrays and cleaning. She is the most gentle and thorough hygienist I've had working on my teeth!  She was terrific!  Following the cleaning the dentist came and discussed the xray findings etc.  He was very personable, explained things clearly and professionally.
I would highly recommend Twelve Bridges Dental!</Text>

I can’t thank Dr. Zanzi and his team enough for making me feel like myself again! I had a dental emergency and Dr. Zanzi made himself available on a Sunday and then made time for me first thing the following morning to do an emergency root canal and fix the front tooth I had knocked out. He was informative, thorough, kind and most importantly he did a FANTASTIC job.  I am so lucky to have found Twelve Bridges via all of the the great reviews, and I see why people speak so highly of this office. Absolutely the best dentist visit I’ve ever had- and I had a root canal and crown put in!< /Review>

The doctors and nurses are great, except the receptionist Jamie (or however her name is spelled). I went into the office one day for my appointment, there were two receptionists at the front. One was busy with another patient, and Jamie was doing nothing. Yet she rolled her eyes(guess cuz I'm not Caucasian?), intentionally ignored me, till the other receptionist was done and called me up. Another day I called to reschedule an appointment, and she told me  she didn't have any openings till after at least three months. Without even trying to help or offering to call me in case there's a cancellation from other patients, or get me in with another doctor. I told her I really needed to get in sooner due to my dental situation, but she obviously got impatient and responded in a rude tone that there was nothing she could do. She is rude in such an obvious way that you can instantly sense the uncomfortable vibe from her. I've always been polite and nice, well-educated, except I do have slight accent. But as a receptionist, why would Jamie gave such an attitude to patients for any reason?? Isn't it her job to at least try to be welcoming and accommodating to everyone? That's what you are paid for after all, right Jamie?! You are not a young girl who is freshly out of college, so come on. We all need to be professional and respectful at work. If you gonna act like a "queen B" as a receptionist, you might as well get another job. Tho I seriously doubt whether you would be able to, due to your lack of professionality.<//review>

pain free , fast , great office. What a nice place to go to do a uncomfortable procedure. I have the Invisiline program and I am very pleased with the process. I had the old braces 50 years ago and needed to do some serious realignment of the teeth and bite for health reasons. What a difference. So sorry I waited. So glad I did it. Kind assistants and Dentists are top notch. Don`t let your age hold you back .< /text>

Love this office and staff so much! The office is so beautiful and the Office staff super helpful and kind. I love how helpful and thorough the dental assistants are to their patients. Dr. Zanzi has done a wonderful job with the many procedures I’ve had done from fillings, crowns and even a bridge. Thank you Twelve Bridges Dental!!!< /review>

The dental hygenist I had was very gentle and careful with her instruments.  In the past I have had some minor cavities filled and I have been very happy with the results.  I like that this office has the very latest in digital xray imaging processing.  I use their insurance program to get the best routine preventative care I can get.< /Review>

<Date>1537550163416< /Date><rating>5<//rating><review>A few days ago, one of my fillings fell out from one of my sensitive teeth. I scheduled an appointment the very next day and I was booked as soon as they opened the next day. Dr. Zanzi was very understanding of the issue and my stress around dental drills, and got me in and out in less than an hour.

I've been a patient there for years, but to first-timers who are uneasy about going to the dentist have nothing to worry about if they go here.< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Dr. Zanzi and his team are fantastic. As one who rarely writes reviews, I had to give Twelve Bridges 5 stars for their incredible service, speed, and disclosure of all procedures! I chose the Invisalign system, and when others told me it would be 2 years, I'm 6 months in and nearly finished! Thank you guys, you have a customer for life.</Review>

Another great experience at Twelve Bridges this past Friday the 31st getting a few fillings.   Dr. Zanzi does a very good job on numbing the skin before injections to make the process painless, works quickly and always asks how I’m feeling while he is working because he seems to really care about my comfort.   I could make a very long wordy review about how Dr. Zanzi made my first root canal as painless as possible 2 years ago, how he recognized a pain in my lower jaw was not a tooth issue but a sinus infection and saved me a few hundred dollars and helped me avoid a needless dental treatment though I was requesting it a few weeks back and how all of my appointments start and end on time saving me the nervous anticipation we all feel in the waiting rooms but I won’t bore you with too many words.   I would like to say that:   The staff is very friendly and (and calm, which is a plus for people fearful of dental work, as I am) and I do highly recommend Twelve Bridges to all my family, friends and coworkers.   If you need dental work, go to Dr. Zanzi!< /text>

Have You ever had a chair massage your back while listening to your favorite musicians at the dentist? This is the most comfortable dentist I've ever been to. Great job< /text>

<time>1535141613495</time><rate>5< /rate><Text>Twelve  Bridges Dental  is highly recommended since they have the best staff working together and has the state-of-the-art dental clinic to deliver the best dental care ever.  They always make you feel  like family.
Whether it be Dr. Raj Zanzi or Dr. Insiya Zanzi, you are rest assured to be under the most engaging, superb, diligence care of both.  You could hardly feel any pain during procedures and treatments
They would even personally exert extra effort to make a follow-up phone call just to check on how you are doing .
So delighted to have found this
dental clinic.<//Text>< Pics>

I live in Suisun city but if I have any dental work, to me, is worth the 1.25 hour trip to visit Dr. Raj Zanzi. I I am NOT a fan of going to the dentist especially with any tooth pain/ache. He does an awesome job addressing if I have any pain (which I rarely have pain with him)  while taking care of what needs to be done. Dr. Zanzi is very patient and is NOT the type of dentist I've encountered who will rush just to get all of his patients done as soon as possible. He is  efficient, gentle,  and very good at his job.</review>

If you do not comfort your app they will just cancel it without letting you know! They have you sign a policy about canceling your appt. But never that you have to confirm!  Sent my son away after he drove 45 min to get there! Obviously if you didn't cancel your app you are going to be there! Never going back!</review>

I originally started seeing Dr. Zanzi when he was on Professional Dr. I then followed Dr. Zanzi when he decided to start his own practice at Twelve Bridges 10 years ago and now to his new office setting on Blue Oaks. We have had a positive experience with him and his staff so much that when my insurance changed I purchased a plan so I could keep seeing him verses changing.  I guess you can say we are happy with his service, love his kind and understanding hygienist, and his office staff is irreplaceable.< /review>

I travel from Oroville to Roseville to have the caring Dentist's at Twelve Bridges Dental take care of my dental needs!  The entire staff is terrific!!  From the moment you walk through the front door you feel like family!!  Truly!!  Always a friendly greeting, coffee bar, current magazines and a wonderfully clean office!  There is a fantastic children's room with toys and movies!!  I have always had the BEST of care and feel like my teeth have never looked better!!  Dr. Raj Zanzi is compassionate and caring, he calls in the evening to "check in" with you to make sure all is well!!  Yes!!  He actually calls you!!  Wow!!  These are just a few reasons that I drive the extra distance. . .I get the EXTRA care!!<//text>

A year ago I was fortunate enough to be referred to Dr Zanzi by friends and wrote a very positive review of my initial experiences, one year later I feel even more strongly about the excellent dental care and the environment in which it is carried out. Dr. Zanzi is extremely competent, professional, and compassionate. I had a 7 month course of treatment for major dental issues resulting in a full upper denture. Knowing how, at the end I was anxious to have the final one attached to the implants,  Dr Zanzi  volunteered to schedule the procedure by staying after closing one night so he and his Assistant could do it. I WAS DEEPLY APPRECIATIVE. I would also mention in connection with this course of treatment, he works with equally excellent colleagues and between he and Dr. Navreet Arora I have the most natural looking teeth I could have ever hoped for.
Overall, the office staff from front desk receptionists, to the Assistants, and the Office Manager are welcoming, pleasant, and thorough.<//Text>

<review>Dear Twelve Bridges Dental Group,

My family and I moved to Roseville in July 2015.  We had a great dentist while when we lived in the East Bay.  We researched quite a few dentists in Roseville.  We settled on Twelve Bridges for our family.  We fell in love with Twelve Bridges Dental Group right away.  The staff and doctors were so welcoming.  My wife was the first to try it out.  She loved it!  She came home with a smile and a cavity!  I went with my daughter in December 2015.  Wow.  Nice cozy chairs, movies, and great staff.  Drs. Raj and Insiya Zanzi are the best dental professionals I have ever experienced.  I had two cavities and they repaired them quickly. They look and feel great now! I also enjoyed the my dental cleaning.  It was the best cleaning I have had in awhile.  They were so kind to my 5-year-old daughter as well.  Thank you for making us feel at home in a new place.

Best wishes,

The La Rue Family

If you enjoy treasure-hunting, this is the place for you. It's the nicest thrift shop in the South Bay IMHO. I've found quality home furnishings, housewares, and clothing here and since they always seem to have great items at a nice price, the turnover is pretty high so you can come here often and not be disappointed with the selection. The employees here are nice, too. All this and it's in a good location! Convenient for donating and shopping.< /Text>

The manager here older gal is rude and doesn't appreciate myself dropping off 12 bags of toys. She acts like she'll have to go through them all to see what's safe etc. I asked her what's her job. She said maybe put it out in front of my house and let neighborhood kids go through it. So annoying. She refused a hula hoop because kids will be problem with it in store. That's fine but all these toys were in great condition. 2 other employees were very nice but not old filipino lady.< /Review>

<review>Never in my 40 years of coming to Goodwill have encountered such underhanded Business practices OUTRIGHT THIEVERY. I'm 45 and have been going to Goodwill since I was five with my mother. I have spent thousands of dollars at Goodwill industries throughout all the states I have lived in. ONLY at this store have I been outright ROBBED. I purchased two wicker cubes at 14.99 each I thought that they would fit in my car but they didn't. So I asked if I could come in two days to get them and it was ok'd they got my phone number and put it on the receipt and on the cubes. Point is I could not find assistance and more than 7 days passed then I was informed that I only had 7 days that it was on the receipt. They had my phone number yet DID NOT HAVE THE DECENCY to call and inform me. I TALKED TO THE MANAGER JOSIAH AND HE OUTRIGHT DECLINED ANY STORE CREDIT CAUSE "ITS POLICY" HE DID THEN SAY "I CAN HOLD THEM INDEFINITELY BUT I CANT GIVE STORE CREDIT" SO I THANKED HIM AND 3 DAYS LATER I CAME TO PICK THEM UP AND HE CHECKED AND HE THEN SAID THEY WERE TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER STORE PROBABLY BY ANOTHER MANAGER THAT DID NOT KNOW OF OUR AGREEMENT AND I LOST THEM AND NO REFUND AND NO STORE CREDIT. I THEN PURCHASED A SEWING MACHINE THAT WHEN I PLUGGED IT IN AT MY HOUSE THE BREAKERS POPPED AND THE SEWING MACHINE STARTED SMOKING. I TOOK IT BACK THE NEXT DAY AND GOT STORE CREDIT BUT THIS PARTICULAR MANAGER DID NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS about my safety or my homes BUT DID all he could not to even look at me. As if giving me store credit for a damaged Item was some sort of a crime. I then purchased with the store credit a Daylight Cosmetic Mirror that was priced at 19.99 and on the box an employee wrote DO NOT OPEN BRAND NEW so I thought I had a deal once I get home I open it and the mirror is unglued the casing is cracked the light is burnt out and the base almost gave me tetanus with all the rust. I call and the cashier that was there the day I purchased it ONE day ago and remembers and I hear her explaining it to the manager SONIA and that I don't have the receipt but she was present and the manager says no they can't give me store credit without the receipt even though knowing I paid for the item with the cashier that was present. So now I have lost or lets say I have been MUGGED by GOODWILL $50 plus dollars!!!  I WILL NEVER EVER EVER EVER AGAIN STEP FOOT INTO ANY GOODWILL STORE ANYWHERE EVER AGAIN!! THEY LOST 32 CUSTOMERS MYSELF, MY MOTHER, SISTER, 5 COUSINS, 2 NIECES IN WISCONSIN AND MY SISTER IN LAW, BROTHER, UNCLE AND FATHER AND STEPMOTHER IN SWFL, MY  4 AUNTS, 5 COUSINS, 7 FRIENDS IN COLLIER COUNTY FLORIDA...BAD BUSINESS PRACTICES SPREADS LIKE CONJUNCTIVITIS AND I HELPED. I KNOW ITS FOR A GOOD CAUSE BUT I AM 2 DOLLARS AWAY FROM BEING A CAUSE AND A SO CALLED NON PROFIT HAVING HARSHER POLICIES THAN WALMART IS NOT REALLY A LOVING AND CARING CHARITY AFTER ALL.<//review>< Gmap_id>

Overpriced for donated items!! Goodwill gets rich off of people who think they are giving to a charity.  The management at this location are rude and don't fit the area, not friendly and poor customer service!!!!< /Text>

<text>5 stars all the way! Ordered lunch for my staff of 20, and it was delivery on time and correctly. My staff appreciated the artisan sandwiches and raved about them all day. The prices are excellent and the quality far exceeded my expectations. I'm so happy I was able to support a local business and get a great sandwich at the same time. I will continue to use them for all my staff functions.<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNE1x-jdMoM66mhkO2X0u50jehtsXbnmjyRmLIT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOZF_wX30QRxrsw71RDPMzIBJ4k1hw5tyVKk3na=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><Resp>{'time': 1610470630818, 'text': "Thank you so much Hans for this satisfactory review !

The lunch combo is hard to beat! The coffee is very good, they even sell their own beans. The service can sometimes be slow but it is definitely worth the wait.</Review>

<Review>Love it! It's like my secret garden! The only thing that's annoying is the parking. The parking is in the rear and the entrance/exit is too narrow and easily blocked. The parking is also too limited.<//Review>< Pictures>

Had a very nice dinner.  The Java Bakery Café' were good - and it is nice to see escargot on the menu since it is kind of a specialty item.  The service was great and the outdoor seating was nice.</Review>

Thai chicken wrap is terrible. It's cold and mainly consists of bean sprouts, cucumbers and carrots. The very little chicken there was in the wrap was cold, white and tasted like it was boiled (not grilled as advertised in the menu). I am not picky with food but this was the worst. Especially considering 12$ price.<//Review>

First time here.  Saw the good reviews and said I have to try it.   Ordered a ham & brie on a toasted everything bagel along with an iced tea.

They put my sandwich on a croissant instead.   They said it was better on a croissant anyway and I accepted it.  Tried it and immediately regretted my decision.

The counter help was professionally polite, but by no means were they warm, friendly, or inviting.

I asked for a refill on my iced tea and they informed me that refills are one dollar.  This is the first time I encountered a charge to refill an iced tea.

Since I eat out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day I am always on the lookout for new places to try.   Needless to say, I will not be frequenting this establishment again.<//text>

This is an amazing coffee shop with plenty of space and a great lunch deal! I had a chance to speak to the owners on a few occasions and they are attentive to their customers and incredibly kind. Their pastries are made in house, as well. I like to go here after quick hikes in the Lake forest area, but I would also highly recommend this place for folks who need to get work done.< /Text>

After visiting several times, this place has become my favorite coffee shop. Their coffee drinks have all been phenomenal, they have fantastic Persian tea, and the pastries I've bought have all been delicious. I will most definitely continue to come back here, especially since the employees are always friendly and helpful, and the environment is so relaxing and calm.
Love love love it!< /text>

Absolutely the best coffees! But more importantly for me... They have great lunch offerings. They bake their bread fresh and make their sandwiches with their fresh bread. I really love having lunch here.

Try their wraps... I think they are very unique and pretty healthy too.</Text>

<Text>This place is so yummy. I've just discovered it a couple days ago and I've ordered a sandwich and panini for lunch from there so far and they were both delicious. I'm working my way through their menu and I haven't been disappointed. I also tried their chocolate chip scone and it's to die for. It literally melts in your mouth. I highly recommend this place.</Text>< user_id>

I'm not sure how you define this as a "bakery". There were no baked goods. Ther was no air conditioning on a hot day. And the cashier tried to short me $5. 2 Stars because the coffee doesn't suck.</text>

< Review>
If I could give this place a zero star I would. Came in at 8:30 when their listing says they close at 9pm was told rudely by the lady at the front desk “last call is 845” I politely showed the lady my phone that said it was 8:30 and she told me “well we aren’t taking any more guests would you like to place it to go.” Absolutely horrible customer service, their food had been great the one time I went before but I won’t be returning based on the customer service at the door. Also change your google listing if this is your actual policy! Trash< /Review>

Service has gone down. Went there as a party of 3 around 2:30pm on a Wednesday. Hardly anyone was there. The servers and manager was just standing in the front. They forgot our water, chopsticks, and napkin. I had to walk to the front to ask them for service. Our food came 15min separately so everyone ate at different times. Sad to say but after years as a patron, we won't be back here again.<//Text>

This was the first restaurant I've been to in over a year due to the pandemic, and I couldn't have been happier with my service. I got the Lion King Roll, and the Shrimp Tempura Roll, along with the a sake sampler. Everything was fresh, and on point. 10/10, would recommend.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOhKt16aEFDiEhdg0dM_eLuB9tYAAf6M5ufuZk2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJH3MHdBx_fiu98Qy93hK0lwCi7qV85EuHuR0b=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

Service was horrible. Got seated around 6. Did not get our food til 7:30. They really need to hire more staff. The food was good once we got it but it took so long. Good thing we had some good company with us to keep us occupied.< /Text>

Great Japanese Bento Box for lunch.  Sushi House is the best Japanese food in Alameda. Great food, great friendly service and great price.  Outdoor dining is nice too!< /Review>

horrible service. they’re horrifically understaffed. came at around 7:30 pm and waited over an hour for seating. there were tables available but we still had to wait 30 minutes to be seated. the food is mediocre and not worth the long wait. will not be coming back.</Text>

<review>One of my favorite places in Alameda! I always can count on Sushi House for great Japanese American food. The bentos are huuuge to the point where it’s difficult to finish them. The sushi is also very well done, and who can forget the rolls?!</review></record>

They always have great food. They even have food for Vegans!
During Covid, I suggest you order online because the wait time is 45 mins to 2 hours!< /Text>

It's worth the money that you paid for it which is not out of the roof it's spot on clean environment exceptionally wonderful and personable staff wonderful customer service. The chefs do an amazing job. Just let them know exactly how you like your sushi and they can do it. One of my top places to go in the Bay Area.<//Review>< Pictures>

Nice location with bay views. Sign yourself in on the tablet/wait list. Lots of parking. Long lines during busy times. Not sure why it was so busy or rated do highly on Google. This was the first time I ate a $100 meal at a restaurant and was given plastic spoons and forks for dining in. Sushi was not impressive. Ordered the sashimi dinner. Salad, white rice, soup and fish. Hamachi was not fresh, probably frozen and thawed few times. My son loved his kids plate tho. Great deal on that meal and tasted good.</text>

Pros: Excellent view, airy/open ambiance, Midwestern portions, Yay Area quality, very reasonable pricing, ample variety!
Cons: Service could be more attentive, food comes out at weird/inconsistent times, and parking is very limited.</review>

<Review>BEST sushi in town!!! But unfortunately, the WORST service in town as well. I'll continue to patron just because their sushi is so good, but will never expect any type of great service.

<review>First time here, definitely wont be my last. The service was fast and they checked in on us regularly, which I like. We were able to be seated right away despite the place being very crowded. Music plays in the background and there’s huge flatscreens that has the Lakers game on. The food was delicious and the portions were very consistent and big. The price isn’t too expensive, but definitely well worth the price.< /review></record>

<text>The miso soup tasted like real miso soup. The ambiance is casual. You get a nice bay view as well, which goes perfectFood service is fair speed. Tenzaru udon was served cold. The flavor was slightly bland and the texture was mildly over cooked. The lion king, and blossom roll were good. The bento boxes had a large selection. The food in from the bento boxes were filling enough. I'd rate them as a B or B+. Would I eat here again?

<Text>Best sushi in the Bay Area! One of the most renown and longest business that has overseen the days of Alameda, Sushi House is know for the best sushi around town. Growing up, I would always come to sushi house with family or friends and even birthday events.

My favorite to order here is the bento box known for its large size and various types of food that comes along with the box. You have two choices of teriyaki beef, chicken, or salmon along with California rolls. I also love to order separately the Lion King Rolls that tastes absolutely delicious with salmon around the sushi roll with rice, avocado, crab meat. I also recommend the raiders roll as well. I’ve been starting to learn how to eat raw, but hear from my family and friends that the raw sushi is superb. Highly recommend to everyone to come to sushi house!</Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaaW75Cyui2-RaShIkKfU-UA21Fr-ZW73khmfE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSWBxI4AlQzK7GTPjKCLjK-d_6kncLyZZR70sj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>After visiting Sushi House on NYE, we decided to dine here on Valentines Day. Unfortunately, both the food and the service were terrible. The server never checked on us and our drinks were never refilled. Shortly after our food was served, we discovered the rolls were not as we ordered. The server argued with me about the accuracy of the dish before agreeing to fix the error. The replacement roll had zero crab, and the saddest pieces of salmon I've ever seen. This was a massive disappointment because we chose to eat here specifically for their Orange Blossom roll, which was excellent on previous occasions.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9oT8btrqtePwTATtLBh6Al3-7Lp9O797D2Wii=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPplpXDMIFpjArrqpUrxDDWE61y93mrAY1_6_fA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

We ordered the cruise ship and it did not disappoint. If you're with a party of 6 or more it's definitely worth it. We even had leftovers.<//Review>

<Text>Sushi House is a local favorite of the people of Alameda. Whenever people think sushi in Alameda, Sushi House is the go to place. That is for good reason. The food here is very good and consistent, however, big surprise it is the sushi that really shines. Every time that I go I almost always end of getting at least 2 of the various special rolls. The portions here are also very sizable. However the prices here can be quite hefty as well as the wait time. I have never come here and not waited for a table and I have never paid less than $50 here.< /Text>< gmapID>

<text>The restaurant was fabulous, the food was large and delicious, and the sake was cold. It loses a star, sadly, because of the service. It could have been where we were sitting, the rush hour of dinner, the restaurant being short-staffed, or any number of reasons. We had a difficult time placing orders, getting utensils and napkins, and even getting glasses for the bottles of sake we ordered. However! While this docks them a star today, I will be returning due to the food and atmosphere, in hopes for better attention from a server, any server. (All in all, I recommend this restaurant if you like any sushi. They have traditional nigiri and sashimi, as well as the non-traditional rolls we Americans love.)< /text>< Rate>

I haven’t been here in years. It’s the best sushi in Alameda in my opinion. I had the bento box with teriyaki salmon and California rolls. The box also came with tempura, soup, salad, and other things.

It was so good!</review>

I’ve been coming to the sushi for many years but man I feel like it’s not like it used to. Found a piece sharp plastic in my rainbow roll. Had to ask for a refund . And a month before found a sharp long bone in my rainbow roll. I’m done. I do not recommend this place<//Review>

We love sitting at the bar when we're here. It's not loud and you can watch them work. The edamame was complimentary and the tekadon meal was excellent. It was my first time having the orange blossom roll, and it was a taste explosion.</Review>

The food is always good, ,except when they are very busy.  We waited 40 minutes to be seated, they took our order very fast and drinks fast, it's downhill from here.  Another 25 minutes one order came out. Then the people next to us who came in way after got there entire order. Another 25 minutes goes by and I've asked about my order, she is going to check on it.  After 5 more minutes she brings me a meal that isn't mine.  Again I asked, then she brings me my order,  very soggy cold tempura ,cold overdone chicken.  Why are they not able to run smoothly when crowded.  Usually it a 5,  but not this time.< /Review>

The wait time was pretty long, but that's a given at Sushi House. The food is great and the fish tastes fresh. The chefs really know what they're doing. Even thought the menu is quite extensive, everything I've ever had there is great. For folx who are sensitive to sound, definitely try takeout because for eat-in dinner it can get pretty loud and overwhelmingly cacophonous.<//text>

Quality has definitely went down over the years but for what it's worth, the large sushi rolls are still worth the price in my opinion simply due to its size<//Text>

It's good for where the location is but mediocre if you compare it with others around the bay.
Service and atmosphere is pretty decent
Their portions are generous for the price
Parking lot out front is pretty small so its advised to park around the plaza during peak hours, especially during dinner.

If you come here you have to get the lion king. It tastes amazing! You will not regret it. The food is very good quality and the rolls are huge. This place is extremely popular so try to make reservations otherwise you will be waiting for quite awhile.<//review>

On a good note I would like to start off and say the food is amazing. But if you're coming here for great service as well, you won't find it here.  Most servers (not all) have attitudes and never bother to smile. They only come to your table once when you are seated or take your orders, and then to give you your check once you're done. Other than that they never come by to check how you're doing or if your needs are met.</text>

We had a big party. The food was great. Not sure why the left dirty dishes at our table, even after we asked several times for them to come and remove them. Customers don't like to sit and eat with dirty dishes around them. When someone is finished with their plate.. remove it.  Anyway the food was amazing. Get the Lion. Get 2 lions. They are even good the next morning. If not for the the service it would have been 5 stars.<//review>

<Review>Sushi House is my go-to sushi place. Love the rolls there (my fav lion king!) and how it's so easy to find parking. Only downside is the wait time on the weekends. I recommend using the yelp check in app, but even then you will still need to wait. If you want nigri sushi it will be pricey.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>We ordered 2 bento boxes to go yesterday for lunch.  We have been longtime customers and fans of Sushi House for years and have always been happy with the food.  Unfortunately we were shocked at the poor quality of the food we received yesterday: Chicken Teriyaki/Tempura bento and the Salmon Teriyaki/Tonkatsu bento. The tempura was ok, but the meat in all cases was dry, overcooked, tough and frankly tasted day old.  For $15/bento, I expect better.  It was disappointing, especially since it was for my partners birthday.  We understand that it's a struggle for restaurants during the pandemic, but when customers try to  support local businesses, it's important to treat their customers in return with respect.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Went here for a late lunch while traveling in alameda and my waiter never refilled my water, never acknowledged me after taking more order and I only received half my order. As soon as I went to ask about it the very rude waiter cut me off and just said “it’s coming” and walked away. When I asked to speak to a manager I was told that the manager had just stepped out, no apology for my wait or water or anything. Do not recommend and will not ever come here again.< /Text>< pics>

<rating>2</rating><text>The only good thing about this place is the service. I remember why I haven't been there for over 8 years during my last visit.

1.  The rice to ingredient ratio in my sushi is 2 to 1. The sushi is enormous because they put so much rice in it. All you taste is rice not the other ingredients.

2.  I ordered tamago roll for my daughter and they decided to put lemon in it. Why???? That's the dumbest thing I've ever encountered.

3.  Conclusion is that it's not sushi chef making your sushi but people disguised as sushi chef and doesn't know what they are doing. You can make sushi but if you don't know why you should or shouldn't put in an ingredient, you're just a cook and not a chef.

I don't recommend this place if you're looking for a good Japanese meal. You won't be seeing me back.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Text>We ordered 2 bento boxes to go yesterday for lunch.  We have been longtime customers and fans of Sushi House for years and have always been happy with the food.  Unfortunately we were shocked at the poor quality of the food we received yesterday: Chicken Teriyaki/Tempura bento and the Salmon Teriyaki/Tonkatsu bento. The tempura was ok, but the meat in all cases was dry, overcooked, tough and frankly tasted day old.  For $15/bento, I expect better.  It was disappointing, especially since it was for my partners birthday.  We understand that it's a struggle for restaurants during the pandemic, but when customers try to  support local businesses, it's important to treat their customers in return with respect.<//Text><GmapID>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b< /GmapID>< time>

<Text>The only good thing about this place is the service. I remember why I haven't been there for over 8 years during my last visit.

1.  The rice to ingredient ratio in my sushi is 2 to 1. The sushi is enormous because they put so much rice in it. All you taste is rice not the other ingredients.

2.  I ordered tamago roll for my daughter and they decided to put lemon in it. Why???? That's the dumbest thing I've ever encountered.

3.  Conclusion is that it's not sushi chef making your sushi but people disguised as sushi chef and doesn't know what they are doing. You can make sushi but if you don't know why you should or shouldn't put in an ingredient, you're just a cook and not a chef.

< review>
I am a 9 year old reviewing on my grandma's phone. The portions are huge, the food is rocking. It isn't the cheapest, but worth it. Service is good. Seating may be scarce during dinner, but least busy if you're having a late lunch. Good location and staff. Big parking lot. Next to a mall. Wait may be long. Remodeling looks very modern. To-go fast. Car wash place across the parking lot. My favorite roll is the Crunchy roll, non-spicy.< /review>

Good food, tasty rolls. It's a large restaurant that you can use for small or medium size groups.  A couple TV's for sports. They are also some nice views to the water. Overall a nice larger scale sushi restaurant.</Text>

<Name>Scott Harrison</Name><Time>1569034321136</Time><review>This is a very popular sushi restaurant with the locals.  Almost always full with a boisterous atmosphere.  The freshness of the seafood is good.  The teriyaki could be saucier but most come for the rolls.  So many to choose from from raw to fried to baked.  I like to pick up but if they say 40 minutes make it more like an hour on the busy nights.  If you make it there before your food is ready keep a diligent eye for your to-go bags because they may forget to call for you.  All in all pretty darn good Japanese food!< /review>< pictures>

We are food hunters, we travel for food 80% of the time SO WE LOVE FOOD! And as food lovers we always expect great service at places we go. It didn't happen at this restaurant, neither the first time we went there, neither THE SECOND ONE! (BUMMER)  But, we wanted to give it a second try ... Nope, FAIL!  It was even worst than the first time 😱
We checked in, waited in line after 7 people ahead of us, we finally got our table ( 3rd table to the right of main entrance to be exact and hopefully they remember us.) So we placed our order and people who ordered first than us got their food first (as it should be, first comes first served, right?. ) Oh well, that rule didn't applied to us... We were waiting for the food to come to our table... 15 minutes, 30 minutes ... Not even the miso soup... People who were waiting after us got their orders, ate, drank, enjoyed their food and left while we were still waiting!!! So I got a little upset since the two tables next to us were almost done with their food and we haven't gotten even a salad at that point! We decided to call one the  waitresses and ask if by any chance our food was being cooked? Guess what? The other waitress didn't put our order! Really? How in this world waitresses are going to pass throughout our table, serve people next to us who just came in and not realize that we were there waiting for our food? HELLO!
We had to wait around 30 extraminutes for our food to come to our table.  They apologized and gave us a "free salad"... Really??? After making us wait for an hour?
I would give this place zero stars if google had the option!< /Text>

My wife loves the sushi here, unfortunately I cannot enjoy the food as well as she can as I cannot eat raw fish but the udon and cooked rolls are equally as good. My favorite dish there is the nabe udon. They also have good side dishes with meat that i can eat. If you can't eat raw fish but have loved ones who do, come here and you will not be disappointed.</Text>

OMG. So much more than a sushi house. Authentic handmade fresh selections. Hot baked or fried ,cooked or raw. Vegetarian fish meat selections. Sake served at the table. Soups amazing. Great customer service.  Eat at the bar or table for a crowd.  Get there early get there HUNGRY.<//text>

The prices are reasonable however the service can use some improvement..It took a good 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order, and we usually had to hunt someone down to either refill our drinks or bring us a sauce or seasoning..it became a full house (per usual) so I would suggest to management to maybe plan better in regards to scheduling to provide better service .< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Food is always good, but as always it is the wait and sometimes the servers are always in a hurry to get your order and not helpful for my guest from abroad. This is the 1st time it has happen, and i dont know if that particular server was having a bad day. Still this is a good place you can grab food near the Oakland airport.</Review>

Portions are big, but the quality is awful in terms of the fresh fish. While the fish itself was not really that old, the way it was cut was terrible. I have been here a few times and everytime I have the fish especially the sashimi is always cut horribly. It seems like the chefs only know how to cut certain types of fish property, as different fish can have different techniques of cutting due to the way the grain is set on the fish. Also I would not go near the bathrooms at all as when approaching them, there was a very weird sweet and odd odor the last time I went.< /Text>

This place is always gonna be packed on the weekends. So I'd definitely recommend coming here during the middle of the week to have a relaxing experience. Food here is great and the place is amazing. Would give it five, but like I said it gets really bad on the weekend and you're gonna be waiting forever to get a table.< /Text>

Updated from 5 stars to 2. I had great sushi here but the fish quality is below tolerable. They do provide very large amounts of fish compared to other restaurants but the fish has a lot of visual imperfections and fat which usually would be removed prior serving.<//review>

<text>The food was really good, we ordered the big boat i think it's called the yacht. The only complaint would be the outside seating heater was uncomfortable for the peole sitting close to the window. It got way too hot and the beers got warm. Besides that inconvenience,  the service was great and the food amazing. Next time we will sit inside.</text>< Pictures>

Great food. Communication between waiter was a rush. First time customer. Ordered simple teriyaki meat over rice and got full bowl meal with salmon, veggies, etc. Meal was super, but adding salad, soup and sushi we was full, a bit over stuffed. However we will go again, make sure we make a smaller order.< /text>

<Review>the food is good but the service absolutely terrible. We waited 1:35 minutes for a table and when we were seated at the table they told us to order fast because they were going to close
and when they brought us the food, a young lady came to pick up everything from our table.
Soy sauce, napkins and I still did not finish my meal and took my plate. We seriously think about not paying for the food. but we paid and we promised not to return to that place.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><user_name>Lourdes G.<//user_name></record>

Sushi house shrimp tempura is very good also most of there items from the sushi menu. Anything else stay away from like the teriyaki chicken which is over cooked and dried out. Service sub par especially the time just before their dinner hours.< /Review>

Solid place for sushi and Japanese fare. Very busy usually, often with a wait. Recently re-done interior made for a little more room. Staff is efficient. Close to the water (Alameda shore is just across the street).</text>

<date>1531166977815< /date><review>Despite no one greeting us and then shoving menus at us like i was bothering them when i asked if there was someone to seat us, the Sushi was good I guess. but they have 1 restroom for a beach side restaurant that must have had 100 people in it.  It was disturbing how they had someone sitting in front of the door and occasionally peeking in to tell you whether you could go in or not depending on if there was already a man or woman inside. The line stretched through the restaurant. I would not go again< /review><name>sshirl s</name><userid>116181863083994349456</userid><GmapID>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b<//GmapID>< Pictures>

Was told x amount of time.  I arrived approximately five minutes before.  Checked in and announced I had ordered to go.  I was informed that my order would be out soon.   30+ minutes later still no food. I checked with the you lady at the podium.  She says.  Oh! It will be right out and asked me to pay.  20 minutes later still waiting.  Finally an hour after I arrived I'm handed my bag.  No thank you.  No we're sorry it took so long.  Nothing.  Too bad.

<Text>The food was fresh, good (if you like Japanese cuisine), plentiful, well presented and timely served. I took half of mine home.
They must have trouble with beachcombers using the restroom facilities. It seems they close every hour 'for cleaning'! And only one was open at a time.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b<//gmap_id></record>

Great Japanese food. I like their bento boxes. I usually ask for Teriyaki salmon and sashimi. They have large TVs so one can watch sports. Wobbly tables can be annoying. Cheers.< /Review>

The wait was long. Tip is when you leave your residence line up on yelp. By the time you arrive it should be about your turn. Just remember to tell the person with the iPad to check you in. The decor was really nice and the food was great and the bento box was in great proportions.<//review>

Having read some comments on here, it's kinda funny! Been coming here for over 15 years of course there sometimes we have to wait a bit due to popularity of the place. Love the kids who are serving. They're great kids and so the freshness of my orders every time and all the time. It has a good view of the East Bay too.</Review>

The food is great, but the customer service on the waiters is the worst. The manager should have a talk to the staff and make them understand that customer service is what keeps customers coming back. Hope they turn this shio ship around before it sinks because i love their food.< /Text>

Awesome graduation dinner party here tonight for both of my daughters, and our family, totaling 14!

<Review>The Lion King roll here is truly the best. We go to other sushi restaurants and Sushi House always has the most delicious one. Their other rolls, bento boxes, and rice plates have always been satisfying as well. One of my favorite restruants. Service and atmosphere is usually great too.</Review>< Pics>

This place was excellent for years. The tea  and house salad were good. The power roll was dry and tastless.</Review>

Can get busy and slow, even during off-peak hours at other restaurants. Too many rolls combine salmon, tuna, avocado, and shrimp or eel.
Would like more rolls that are simple, just a few ingredients.< /text>

Good hours.
Very popular restaurant. Fortunately it is fairly large.

If there is a wait list, you can see if there sushi bar has seats available.

Excellent menu with huge selection of items.
Try one of the combo plates with sushi, soup, entre, side, etc.<//Text><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

Horrible customer service here. I was hoping to be seated at the bar to wait there, since it was going to be about a 30 min wait. The host really rudely told me not to seat there, when the whole bar was empty. The food was OK but it took forever to get served. After I have gotten my food the waiter told me to switch tables. After we got all of our food he noticed that there was just no room for us to manage with all the food in the ridiculously small tables that the have. He asked if we wanted another table to put all of our food there. Finally after we were ready to start eating again another waiter comes and takes the second table our first waiter had given us. I was super pissed BAD BAD service. Do not recommend.<//Text>

<username>Cody Cassani<//username><Review>Always has awesome sushi and lots of options for plates, a la carte rolls, desserts, and drinks (beer, wine, sake, sodas). The only thing keeping me from giving them a 5 star rating is that on multiple occasions the servers have forgotten to bring small items. Mostly miso soup or extra rice. Never charged for it though which is good. Also gotta love the views of the bay from here! Definitely a good date and family lunch/dinner spot.< /Review><response>None</response><user_id>102469778871740927786< /user_id>< Pictures>

I think people used to come from all over the bay for this place but I dont think it still lives up to that reputation so it gets some bad reviews.   The sushi is still very good, they have a wide selection,  and it overlooks the bay.  It is very family friendly,  for better or worse.  Be prepared to wait on most nights and it can be a little loud.</review>

I guess this is the place to be when you're in Alameda. Cam here on a weekend night and there was about a 20 minute wait for 2. We weren't picky about where we sat and go the bar. We could see the chefs making sushi which was cool and hoped that it was ours every time they passed something over the table. We got the Bay Scallop, Hella Hot and Island to share. They were all okay. Nothing in particular stood out to me. I like the baked rolls (Bay Scallop), but it was just alright for me.

Overall, okay sushi, decent prices.</Text>

The location is nice, but the service was terrible. At 8pm at night it seemed there was only 1 sushi chef and we got 1 roll at a time about 20 min or so apart...we got 4 rolls. My boyfriend and I ordered only veggie rolls as we are vegan and they weren't the greatest. It's also sad when they offer a vegetable udon, but vegetarians/ vegans cannot eat it cause they use the same broth for all soups...fish base. Most places I've gone offer a vegetable broth for the vegetable soups so more have the ability to enjoy. Don't think we will be going back anytime soon.< /Text>

Authentic and a huge menu. This is a great location for anyone wanting to enjoy great views of the Bay while eating some of the best sushi I have had in a very long time. The menu offers a great mix of American favorites along with traditional food. Anyone who complains about the price has to realize that quality and environment isn't cheap. Yet, I did not find the bill large for two people with out alcohol.</Text>

Eh, it was good but not 50-60 a person good. 🙃 Also the wait was pretty daunting. Maybe I am cheap. Maybe I am just not used to everything costing 3x what I usually pay in the Midwest. It was meh.<//text>

We have been going to the Sushi House for over 10 years now. We use to go almost twice a week, however for the past 2 years we have been avoiding it. Quality of the suchi has gone way down. Now they have become big lump of rice with little fish, and roles are way too big and falling apart. It looks like they are trying to increase the size of the pieces by adding rice and justifying their price... It is sad to see a good restaurant go down like this.<//Text>

<Date>1564007329296<//Date><rate>3<//rate><Review>Sushi house is slipping a bit. 1 of the reasons besides the food people continue to go to a restaurant is the service. Last time I went, the service was terrible. Took way to long to come over, brought out bits and peices of the order so, I started eating before my companion who basically got her food when I was almost finshed. It was just ok. Disappoiting because I remember when they first opened and how friendly they were. Now ehere are they getting these servers from. Go back to the drawing board and remember the principles you opened the restaurant with.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Great-tasting, quality food!!! This is our go-to Japanese restaurant. We have brought our relatives here who aren't from the Bay Area, and they've all loved it.

This is a very busy resturant. You can get on the waitlist early if you go through yelp. The sushi was good. I got the $110 boat for the table. This is the chefs choice of sushi but it is 10+ rolls so decent deal. Bummy part was that the rolls did fall apart with minimum pressure.</review>

<review>I have yet to figure out why so many people go here. The service is unfriendly and slow, and the sushi is not fresh. I have been there three times and have tried multiple things and they all are not pleasing. There are soo many better places to eat in town than here.

<text>Most consistently good sushi restaurant I've been to in the area. The fish is always fresh and the Lion King roll is the best one I've had! The menu also has a lot of pictures so you can see many of their specialties. There are also Bento and Bowl-style meals if sushi isn't really your thing.< /text>< time>

You can ALWAYS get Very good sushi at another place...its at the corner of Broadway and Santa Clara. (Front door on Santa Clara side). I don't think I can say the name of this Sushi Restaurant but it is ALWAYS ALWAYS GOOD!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

My guess is this restaurant would have a 4-5 star rating if you factored out the lousy service. I've patronized this restaurant for years and the service has never improved only the food keeps myself and family from returning. Their workers seem to be poorly trained or just really don't care. It's unfortunate because this restaurant is in a really nice location and does prepare good food.</review>

<Text>They need to have more workers at all times. It gets so packed and noone is served. BUT their food is delicious. I love Island Roll, and Lion King whenever they are done well. Their food is not consistent but still good to eat there one in awhile esp since sushi do tend to get expensive.< /Text>< gmap_id>

<Rate>3</Rate><Text>#Alotoffood. I enjoyed Sushi House! I was hungry and looking for a decent place with a good value. I came to the right place, because I won't go hungry eating here. I ordered a combo, but instantly wished that I went with sushi and rolls. It's a odd habit of mine. I always want some kind of meat and tempura with sushi as my side item. If only there was a way I could not get full on the the combo stuff and make roll for at least one roll. I guess I need to bring more people so we can share. I was so jealous when the table next to me ordered the Raider Roll! You know I represent, but I had way too much food in front of me to support the roll and my favorite team.

The parking situation can get a little crazy since it's on the corner of the shopping plaza, but I'm sure if you get there early for dinner this won't be problem. I was about to park near the front. The location near shoreline is the best part. This is a perfect for a date and affordable enough for the average college student.</Text>< pics>

Loved the food here from the sushi to the combo options in the bento box. Might not be the cheapest out there, but definitely worth the money, every bite.<//Review>

If you love rolls... yeah, come here. It's very popular and I used to like it too. But now I can just convince myself to go anymore. Gotta take Japanese food more seriously.<//Review>

<date>1612318879538</date><rate>2<//rate><Text>They have not mastered the covid-19 restaurant experience. The outdoor dining is literally painfully cold. I never complain about a place being too cold, but sushi House outdoor dining area is in an ice cavern. They have overhead heaters, but none of them were on. There's a cold wind blowing between a glass shield and the building.

Service is extremely slow. I understand that they are targeting the doordash and take out customers, but the service for both of them are also extremely slow.

Finally, what used to be a spicy tuna roll tonight was a tuna roll with a blob of sriracha sauce on top.part of what makes a spicy tuna roll tasty is that the tuna and Sriracha are mixed and refrigerated. A blob of sriracha makes for a uncomfortably spicy, poorly balanced tuna roll.

My two star review is a downgrade from what used to be a four star review for this restaurant. some restaurants have succeeded with the covid-19 procedures. But sushi House has not.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The service was kind and prompt but the quality of the fish wasn't great. I ordered the fatty tuna app and was disappointed. I also had a seaweed salad which was served on top of a bed of lettuce to make it look like you were getting a large portion. Lastly i got a spicy roll that was falling apart when served and was mostly vegetables. Overall I wasn't thrilled but it was cheap and right next to the car wash where I was waiting so I may go back.<//text>

I've tried this place a few times in a stretch of 8 years and the service is bad for non-asian patrons. The service is obvious.... no refills no are you OK, nothing just the food and Bill at the end. Asian get treated and get better service here.< /text>

Despite the crowds, this place is worth it. Huge portions, fresh fish, really tasty Korean and Japanese dishes. Drinks are reasonably priced, too. They usually have sports on< /Review>

If you love Japanese cuisine, don't eat here, it'll bring you nothing but heartbreak. But if you like cheap food with low-quality ingredients prepared with an empasis on presentation over flavor, knock yourself out.</text>

<review>They have not mastered the covid-19 restaurant experience. The outdoor dining is literally painfully cold. I never complain about a place being too cold, but sushi House outdoor dining area is in an ice cavern. They have overhead heaters, but none of them were on. There's a cold wind blowing between a glass shield and the building.

Service is extremely slow. I understand that they are targeting the doordash and take out customers, but the service for both of them are also extremely slow.

Finally, what used to be a spicy tuna roll tonight was a tuna roll with a blob of sriracha sauce on top.part of what makes a spicy tuna roll tasty is that the tuna and Sriracha are mixed and refrigerated. A blob of sriracha makes for a uncomfortably spicy, poorly balanced tuna roll.

My two star review is a downgrade from what used to be a four star review for this restaurant. some restaurants have succeeded with the covid-19 procedures. But sushi House has not.< /review>< pictures>

I assume people go here for the fact that it's eight next to the beach.  My son likes the beach and so we go here occasionally to eat.  The fish meal is probably one of the better choices.  Though I have been here probably like four times and not eaten anything because I've had a few very meh experiences.  The portions are big at least.  I got to katau once and it was not good.  Also had tempura once that was Soo.  The rolls look good but the best values are the meals.  Still we'll go back because my son likes sushi after the beach.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x808f86a45a3d7401:0x50ee9025dc45fa4b</GmapID></record>

They have really high quality food with fresh ingredients. Even the lunch bento feels a step above what I typically expect. Come early though since it is a popular spot and very often full.< /review>

<userid>107589524474345777412</userid><Text>I give Sushi House a solid 3 stars, the sushi rolls were good, but not spectacular. The bento boxes were huge, the over all quality and quantity was definitely a good value for the price. For two people we had sushi rolls, bento boxes and soft drinks all for $77.

The menu is quite large, five pages. One page is nothing but pictures of all the sushi roll with the name listed under neeth. Great idea for anyone new to sushi.

For dinning out midweek, I was very suprized how busy it was. We didn't feel rushed, but the wait staff seemed to be overwhelmed. At one point I think I counted six sushi chef's behind the counter, but three or four wait staff to deal with well over fourty tables in the main dining area. This is most definitely a high volume establishment.

I was disappointed with the fact that they did not have any seared items, Like seared Ahi tuna. Also be prepared to take home left overs.

If you are new eating sushi or have never tried it but have wanted to Sushi House would be a good place to start.<//Text>< user_name>

< Review>
Not the world's greatest sushi rolls, but they are HUGE. For under $40 for two, I can walk out of here absolutely stuffed (+1 for that because I usually walk out of sushi restaurants still hungry after dropping $100).

I think this place used to be a Coco's or something, and it still feels like it inside. The atmosphere is loud, a few tables look like fold-out card tables to squeeze more people in, and it almost has a cafeteria-like feel. I was expecting a food fight to break out at any time. But you do get a decent view of the water.

So go to get stuffed with mediocre sushi, but don't expect an upscale, top-notch sushi restaurant.< /Review>

The service and food can be a bit hit or miss here. I like coming here for their sushi lunch or nigiri mix.  The place is very close to the beach, so you get a really fantastic view from inside. There is also typically a pretty long wait for dinner on weekends (getting seated, and the subsequent service).<//Text>

Good setting in this shop, not for everyone. It's not a world rated sushi quality, but the I like the distance to the beach for a walk and the overall setting.</text>

However, there is bit of a wait depending on the time you go, also their service is very bad, the waiter was very angry and inattentive.

I would still come here but not at late lunch time to avoid the wait.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>Seems like nearly every time I come here the service is bad. But today the service was fine but the rolls were falling apart and the tempura was cold and tasted like it had been sitting for an hour. I had to send it back.
Also in observing the entire sushi bar and those making the Sushi etc. 10 out if 11 were not even Japanese. All I can say is that it showed in the way the sushi was rolled and prepared. This will be my last time here. It's just not authentic and I think management is doing a poor job. Too bad really cause it's in a great location.<//Text>< Pictures>

I have been here many times over the past few years and have finally caved and decided that getting take out was a better option.  You might be wondering why this place is always so crowded when the service is so poor- it's for their rolls!  Decent price and huge!  So as long as you come expecting just that you'll leave feeling full and happy.</review>< pics>

<Review>Good food but rice was packed loosley which only made eating sleightly harder than usual. Still the time there was good and the was bearable despite the amount of people waiting to get in.

Service was terrible, waitstaff ignored us and only responded when we asked about a table. The island sushi had gobs of roe on the top, and the spider was cold giving me the impression it was refrigerated and they didn't take sufficient time to cook it. Totally disappointing. I used to eat there several times a week when I worked at the court but my recommendation is tempered by the service and the quality of the food. Oh, they only had 2 people cleaning the restaurant so it wasn't very clean.< /text>

Not bad for sushi, but not the best. Sashimi tastes fresh and cut well, but the rolls are too large for each piece. The tolls aren't rolled tightly either so stuff just falls apart. They do, however, have a ton of special maki and temaki, as well as a few cooked sushi dishes, so it's a great place to introduce folks to sushi. We got the sushi yacht and 4 rolls for 6 people and it was way too much food. Still pretty good for a family place.</text>

< Review>
Super dependable. Open late. Solid sashimi. And great bento boxes and teriyaki dinners. Plus, servers can be really nice. Tonight I asked for no rice since I’m trying the Whole 30 diet and the guy serving us brought out a gigantic salad with avocado and sprouts and tomatoes as a substitute. That was very cool of him! :)</Review>

<review>Ok, if you want good quality sushi at a reasonable price, go to Sushi House. I had the deluxe chirashi here and it was awesome! They were very generous with their portions, including the uni, which is a total win in my book! :D</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
Ordered for a pick up and was told to come in 30 min. When showed up the food wasn't ready and had to wait another 35 min. when got home it turned out they charged me foe a sushi roll that was't in the box.When called to tell them the person on the phone said that I will have a credit for that amount when I come next time! I'm not planning to come next time!! They also forgot to put a sauce on one of the rolls and low sodium soy sauce as we asked. The food is hit and miss. One day it's fine and next done in a sloppy not appetizing way. My dinner was ruined last night and next time going to the place that treats the customer better.</review>

Hey, Alameda has it's tourist traps too!  Crummy food, both the sushi and stuff from the kitchen.  Always a wait, which totally confuses me, but yeah the view is great.  There are many far superior sushi places on the island.  Save your money.< /text>

I'm sorry to say that the service here is pretty bad.  Although the last time we went we had a server that knew how to cater to our many kids we had with us.  But usually they're really busy and don't really take enough time making sure we had water, napkins, etc, unless we asked for it.  And sometimes they place us at a table where a child seat really gets in the way of everything.  I give this place two stars (**) on my more than two kids friendly meter.  And when it's busy, which is most of the time, no place to put the stroller if you've got one.</text>

This place is very popular with Alamedans and San Franciscans. I'm not sure why. It's not bad, but not spectacular. I would go again because it has an extensive menu with a lot of different options.  I had the popular Lion King roll, which was mediocre. I also had the  Hella Hot roll, which was good and spicy. The restaurant has a nice view of the bay.</Text>

<text>The wait here isn't as long as it used to be. Maybe because they've changed owners so many times that the food isn't as consistent and good as before. I still like it because I'm a fan of really big, fancy, complicated, saucy sushi.</text><response>None< /response><name>Lucille Yee< /name>< GmapID>

The sushi quality is middle of the road, any environment is almost cafeteria like. It used to be very cheap, but now it's so popular that the prices are at or above those of much better restaurants. It is by the beach. Unfortunately, there isn't always enough parking in the lot to support the huge number of tables inside.</Text>

Ordered two rolls and was asked to pick my items up within 25 minutes. Got there af tre r 30 minutes and had to wait another 15 minutes for my rolls to be prepared. Ordered lion king roll and another rolls which was supposed to be similar to a 49er roll (salmon, lemon slices, crab meat, etc.). Long story short, paid about 30 dollars for two rolls, ateless than half the food. Worst rolls I have ever tasted in my entire life. Last time I went to sushi house.<//Review>

< Review>
This place is reasonably close to my office, so I go here for lunch/dinner quite often. We also had a few company outings here. This is not really authentic Japanese restaurant. One of my Korean coworkers told me the place is owned by a Korean. The food is still quite delicious though (approved by one of my visiting Japanese coworker).

My favorite is the Sake Don. It's basically slices of salmon sashimi, tamago on a bed of sushi rice. They also give slices of lemon. Very fresh, very delicious, generous serving. What more can you ask?

As for the rolls, the serve several fusion dishes like baked scallion rolls. It's definitely different, definitely can't be found in Japan, but definitely good. Bring friends so you can share different varieties of rolls, or just bring a date and enjoy a short walk in the beach afterwards (bring layers, it can get pretty cold).< /Review>

<Name>Deanna< /Name><review>I really loved this place. The service wasn't great, but man the prices are amazing! The prices, for the quality of food and sushi are completely worth the drive out. Not to mention the bento boxes are out of this world.

To be honest, I'd never seen one of my friends be FULL off of a bento box, but he didnt even finish the one he ordered at Sushi House. I definitely recommend this place, and coming on an empty stomach!<//review>< Resp>

<review>Bit of a disappointment here. Waited over an hour to eat mediocre sushi. The price was up there, but not the quality. Their sushi was ok but the temperature was off (almost room temperature). Oysters were nice and fresh but their $90.00 boat was mixed. We opted for the all sashimi option and most of the fish taste fresh but again the temperature of the sashimi was on the room temperature side.

Their rolls were a bit on the sloppy side and was ok.

Service here is spotty maybe because they're busy. It was also very room in the restaurant.

I miss Kamakura...< /review><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<username>Sam S</username>< Review>
I often go to Sushi House because it is close and affordable.  The wait for this restaurant is pretty long and it lasts late into the night.

I usually get the bimbibap salad which is a bed of salad greens tossed with chrysanthemum leaves and roughly chopped raw garlic and topped with sashimi (salmon, tuna, and tako).  They give a sweet and spicy Korean hot sauce so that people can customize the spiciness.  A bowl of rice is also provided to chow down this dish.  This is a delicious and refreshing dish although not always a hit because of the raw garlic and potential less than premium fish.

Everyone always raves about the Lion King Roll, which is pretty good, but not necessarily worth the almost $12 price tag.  The roll is a baked salmon roll with a sweet miso mayo sauce.  Tasty, but if you have tried it once, try something else on their extensive menu.

Also Sushi House is Korean owned and operated, not necessarily important, but if you are looking for authentic Japanese food this might not be that place.<//Review>

Sushi doesn't taste the same anymore. I remember the first time I came here I really loved it, but every time after that, was only decent. The service there is really bad, and kind of rude. The chefs were nice but the food now is kind of bland.<//Review>

I've been here over 300 times in the 15 years my family has been going to Sushi House. Expect to wait an hour and have the worst service ever. The food rewards the wait.</Text>

<review>Bad food - old stinky fish.
Bad service - nobody says hi to you, nobody welcomes you, you ask something and they forget about you.
Bad environment - crowded, noisy and stinky.
There are way better places to go for food in Alameda, avoid this one</review>< Pics>

<review>The food is ok and I mean just ok. But the service is so slow and they are not very attentive. I ordered one roll and it took 20 mins. Then after getting my food I was left so long without being checked on that I had time to write this review...I will not be coming back.<//review>< gmap_id>

<text>I wanted to see the hype because it seems like Sushi House is famous, even for those not that familiar to Alameda.

I ordered the 2 item bento box with salmon terriyaki and tempura (1 piece of shrimp and a few veggies). My friends ordered a lion king roll and orange blossom roll, and the other ordered the katsu donburi. The bento box and katsu donburi come with soup and salad.

The sushi came out first. The orange blossom roll wasn't bad, the salmon wrapped around tasted fresh. But overall nothing impressive. The infamous lion king roll was fine. But definitely not rolled very well. Just picking it up it fell apart.

The katsu donburi bowl came out next. I didn't try any of it but my friend seemed unenthusiastic. She was picking around it, and the katsu looked soggy.

After about 20 min my box finally came out. The tempura was cold and bit soggy. The salmon was warm. It seemed like the entire time I was waiting for my box, my food was just sitting there. Meh.

The service was poor. Our waitress seemed rude and every time we asked for anything we'd get an eye roll. We didn't get spoons when she dropped off our soups (we just drank it from the bowl because we were starving) and then when my friend asked for a spoon for her katsu bowl, she handed her a plastic spoon. Seriously? There was a waitress that was going around filling waters and also cashed us out, she seemed nice though!

Do I see the hype? NOPE! There's better sushi places to eat in Alameda.</text></record></dataset><record>

The wait time is excruciatingly long and one of the employees were very rude about face coverings. I have eaten here for years and had wonderful experiences but its unfortunate that I didn't have a good experience 😕</review>

(Translated by Google) You have to book a seat with your own computer. You can sit there. There are elderly people who don’t know the computer. Can’t make a reservation. Very unhappy. It takes a long time. Entering is slow. It is much faster than writing by yourself.

(Original)
要自己用電腦訂位.才能入坐.有老人家不識電腦.不能訂位.很不高興.時間長.入坐慢.比用薄自己寫快多.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The restaurant has a good environment! There is an invincible sea view, there are a lot of parking spaces at the door, and the sushi sashimi tastes good and variety! It often bursts into the sun shed, and you must have patience when you are late!
