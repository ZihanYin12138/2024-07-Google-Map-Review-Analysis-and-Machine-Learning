Excellent service by Chem Dry of Marin.  Great communication with the office and Sean, the technician, was on time and did an excellent job removing stains, particularly tough pet stains.  I have been using this company and will continue to do so.  I would highly recommend their service.< /Text>

<text>The best carpet cleaning around.  The fact that very minimal water is used is wonderful.  As a mold consultant, too much water on carpet can cause problems.  Peter and his crew are professional and very reasonable.  They also immersion clean area rugs in their shop which I recommend to all of my clients.  Thanks for the great service!<//text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x8085a2ceecad7e07:0xa010a362df04ebb7< /gmapID></record>

<Review>iT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE DOING BUSINESS WITH CHEM DRY OF MARIN and I love the way my white carpets look when Sean finishes cleaning them!  I am ;living with advancing Parkinson's, so I am not dragging a vacuum around any more, and with the addition of 5 caregivers who come and go 24/7 plus my inquisitive kitty, who always follows me around wherever I go, you can easily figure that the carpets don't stay clean for long,  I need to have the rooms most used cleaned at least every three months!   Then, Sean comes and works his magic  on them, and they  look bright and white as new when he is ready to leave! One of the things I like best about Chem Dry is the fact that the carpets are dry in about an hour, and they never have to be stretched from having too much moisture left in them like my prior carpets,which were not given the care from Chem Dry!  I am very glad to have Chem Dry as one of my " go to" companies that i use to keep my home looking nice!
So ,i say ,"Thank you, Chem Dry of Marin ... JOB WELL DONE!".

Cedric arrived on time and I recognized a cheerful face who had cleaned my carpets before.   After listening to my concerns, he reassured me that there would be no problem with one of my tables staining my carpet because the rug was still wet as had happened years ago....maybe with another carpet cleaner.  Now my carpet looks like new.  A very efficient job.<//Text>

Chem-Dry of Marin
I was very pleased  Chem-Dry came on time  (8:00 am) to do my carpet. I was thrill and felt that my own time was being valued, I didn't need to worry about how I was going to keep my personal schedule. Thank you!  My carpet looked really nice and felt soft when it dried.  They are professional and pleasant to work with.  I will recommend them and will also be using them again.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Had our carpets cleaned yesterday and I was very skeptical on how clean they would get because the "trail" of footprints was ingrained into the carpet. Cedric was our technician and he said he would do his best to get the stains out and I was shocked that he was able to get most of it out, I now no longer have two toned carpet. Besides being amazing at his job, he was very nice and courteous, I will definitely be requesting him in the future.</review><Date>1542304237538< /Date>< response>

Cedric was great! He arrived exactly at 8 a.m. and did an excellent and efficient job cleaning our cream colored carpets. He even took time to show me how to properly spot clean before our next professional carpet cleaning. We definitely plan to use Chem-Dry again and specifically ask for Cedric. Best service around.<//Text>

This is the second time I have used Chem-Dry, and I have been very happy with their service both times. They are prompt, cooperative, and helpful. I also like the cleaning supplies that they use. They do a good job, and dry much more quickly than other water-based types.</review>

Update: So what I thought was an excellent job was not. I requested the sanitization and and treatment that contained enzymes to ensure any possible pet scents were removed from the carpet. Apparently this was not actually done, and due to that I lost my deposit. A room that did not wreak of urine suddenly did after they used just the sanitizer and nothing else to break down the material that could cause future problems.

My landlord withheld my deposit for new carpet. When I contact this company to ask for a witness statement essentially, they notified me the man that showed up had discussed options with me and I had refused that service. Which I explained was not the case otherwise I wouldn’t have called and asked specifically for both processes to be done. I called 3 times over the course of a couple weeks before anyone actually talked to me. I asked if I could speak with whomever to find a solution to my having paid a couple hundred for carpet cleaning, just to have to pay for another company to do it again and new carpet in a room. I was told the owner said he would call. After a few days I called back then after a week and another week until I gave up.

Not only was this entirely unprofessional but their inability follow what was on the tag to do what I requested caused me to lose close to $800.

I will never use this company again. They made things worse and provided absolutely no customer service and didn’t do anything they said they would at any point. Never again.

I’m so bad with names. I think it was Mike? Anyway, super nice guy did an excellent job....and they gave me a call to let me know when he would be there during my window. The lady answering the phone was really nice, informative, and totally transparent with the pricing. They were even out here the next day (sorry for the traffic home!) ...If I ever need to I’ll definitely be using them again.</Text>

Great job, reasonable price, and they were able to schedule me the day after I called.  I will use them again!
I called them again when tenants moved out and we moved back in.  They dealt with pulls and stains in carpet that was new 14 months ago.  It looks good as new!</Review>

<review>Chem Dry of Marin is the best rug cleaning company out there. They can even do your area rugs. Their employees are professional & go the extra mile to get your carpet clean.

Chem Dry always does an excellent job of removing the stains from my two dogs.  Having the Carpet dry shortly after cleaning is huge benefit to me.  I have used Chem-dry for years and will continue to use for all carpet cleaning needs

As usual, Sean did a phenomenal job!  Being a hotel, we get a lot of wear and tear on our carpets, spilled coffee and soda.  So we use Chem-dry somewhat often.  Sean knocks it out of the park every time.  He's fast and efficient, plus he left me with a product for fighting stains in the future.  I really can't say enough about the good work this company does.  The price is good and the work is great.  I've used them for years and will continue to use them in the future.

Chem Dry of Marin is great. I was impressed on how clean they got the carpets. I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for Chem Dry. Carpets dried completely by the next morning and I just had to vacuum a little debris afterwards. Thank you again.</text>

Dirty water splattered over our walls (and left there until we requested to have them cleaned, which was an additional time suck to this process)  and our baseboards ruined and rippled by water damage.

Chem-Dry of Marin is the company to call for cleaning carpets. I buy and sell houses and Chem-Dry is the only company I use. They are professional and on-time. I know when I call Peter at Chem-Dry, the job will be done right. It really makes my life easier and allows me work on all the other moving parts. Thank You!</review>

I have been consistently pleased with the quality and care Chem-Dry has given my carpets and upholstery.  Sean was efficient, fast and thorough, and very professional.  I will continue to use Chem-Dry for my carpet, rug and upholstery needs in the future.

Fantastic job!!  Scheduled at noon on Tue and work performed the next morning!  We were going to rip out the carpet in the house we had just purchased as it had so many stains, but couldn't manage in time prior to move in, so had the carpet cleaned instead.  It looks almost new!  We may now end up keeping the carpet much longer than intended.

Additionally, the carpet had been pulled up along the edge in multiple places and Chem-Dry fixed it!  Couldn't be happier w/ the service.</review>

Peter was gracious enough to come by and check out the situation ahead of time, made recommendations and then Cedrick came out on our scheduled appt (wiith a call ahead of time) and did a fabulous job! Professional, courteous and explained all well and the carpets looks beautiful! Thank you all! I always refer to every one of my clients and love that it takes so little time to dry. Ideal for our fast-paced lives.<//Text>

<Review>They have the BEST Gluten-Free Pizza I’ve ever had!! The staff was so friendly and the outdoor seating is so nice with the patio heaters on 🔥 You can tell they put a lot of effort into there business and it’s shown through the food they put out. Thanks again for a great dinner experience!<//Review>< Pics>

They did not deliver our pizza and said it was available for pick-up. They refused to make a new one for delivery and informed after an hour. We are still waiting for our delivery but may need to order elsewhere now</Review>

<text>Wanted to support a local place to eat last night. My 8 year old son loves Jim’s Pizza more then anything. Ordered online and almost immediately received a call from a sweet lady saying they were swamped (due to all the madness going around). She said it might be 2.5 hours before we would get it delivered. No big deal to us since pizza and the people who work there are awesome!!!! Ended up getting our delicious order in about an hour and they even gave us a free extra speciality pizza!!! Jim’s Pizza will be the only place I go in McKinney for pizza from now on!! You guys rock!!!!< /text><username>Jennifer Swilling< /username><userid>110913333899731405173< /userid><Rate>5</Rate></record>

<Resp>None<//Resp><name>James Holden< /name><Review>The food was good and came for a great price. The staff is super friendly, not just with me, but with every customer I saw come in. It's a great, friendly environment. The location is in a convenient shopping center, and most people took their food to go (or had it delivered), so there was plenty of seating, indoors and out, that I wouldn't be worried about finding a table. The toppings choices were plentiful, more than certain pizza shops, and they were tasty. We only ordered pizza, but there was tons of other stuff available on the menu as well.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>This is my favorite pizza of all time, I've been coming here my whole life and LOVE it.  One slice (which is actually 2 in size). Is only $4.50 and it's only 50¢ a topping.  They also have draft beer which is unique for a pizza place.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

Rocco's has the best pizza in the area. The huge thin crust​ slices are always cooked perfectly and covered with fresh toppings. The burgers and chicken sandwiches are very good, and salads are made fresh when ordered.< /Review>

<user_name>Daniel Nebenzahl< /user_name><text>Great place for the American style pies many people  grew up with before the pizzas became personal (smaller, thinner and gourmet). Don't get me wrong, the pizzas are good but it won't impress those looking for 'atmosphere'... and really... that is what makes this place super special to me.  This is a pie to take home and share with your friends or family while watching a cool movie on Netflix! Don't miss this little gem tucked in near the Blithedale Whole Foods when you want to chow down on a real AMERICAN pizza.</text>< time>

Previously we ordered wings that arrived cold and undercooked.

Please be careful if ordering from here.  The Pizza is serviceable/good, fine for pickup. but the delivery is probably miss or miss.< /Review>< Pics>

Pizza was reasonably tasty. The pizza "by the slice" is really just cheese pizza that they'll throw whatever toppings you want on. Service was friendly and bathroom was clean.< /text>

< review>
Two small pizzas and an order of wings were almost $50! The wings were so tiny, cold, and some had no edible meat. The pizza had no flavor, like someone didn't give a care in the world.
I'm so sick of restaurants in the area charging so much for their bad food and poor service, simply because they're in a nice neighborhood! Please close your doors and rethink why you're in business.</review>

< Review>
Longer than expected wait for take out pizza that was ordered in advance. Ordered online and got there 20 min later to pick up and they said...oh, we just got your order and put it in the oven. Really? Price is ok relative to Marin County. The pizza is "ok" but nothing remotely close to memorable. Overall a disappointment. And the price for extras on the pizza? Ridiculous!< /Review>

<Text>Average tasting pizza , predictably Mill Valley priced = hilariously overpriced, dated décor, plenty of parking, and fairly friendly and helpful staff.  All totaled, equals a medium score.< /Text><user_id>110880461843623250194< /user_id>< rating>

I had the full order of pasta with sausage it's good but the portion is small and not filling for the price of $12+. They need to give more or charge less.< /Text>

< Review>
Great NY style slices. Order the "one" slice and you really get two large slices and a drink for $4.50. Can't be beat - it's the Mill Valley equivalent of SF's Arinells (sorry, not even close to Arinell's but it's all in context right?).

I had them deliver to a park for a kids party and they were exactly, I mean exactly on time... consider the delivery spot on and the pizza arrived nice and warm. This is a great kid's place but adults should like it too + it beats Stefano's rubbery cold slices.<//Review>

I have to admit, El Sazon de Las Gorditas was definitely phenomenal. Awesome menu items, friendly staff, lovely mood - what more could you ask for? Every thing that I have ordered was really great and I would come again to have it again! I really liked the service too, they are really polite and accommodating. Terrific! Will return and recommend this place always.<//Review>

Jose and His Restaurant on Wheels here in La Puente is as Good as It Gets!  Seriously!!  Although I've been out or the lunch truck scene for over a decade!  But if All Lunch Trucks were like Jose's, Restaurants would be going out or business Left and Right!  He's got an Amazing Operation here!  Food that will Knock Your Socks Off!!  And prices that are sooo low, you'd think you were back in the 70's!!  The food that comes out or the kitchen here is worthy of the Finest Mexican restaurant in Puerto Vallarta or Cancún!  In addition to being a Solid Food Truck, you've got Jose who is soo humble with work ethic that isn't seen anymore.
In fact the food her Must be good as it was the first time I've seen law enforcement (two of La Puente's Finest) enjoying a Code 7!
Gracias, Jose!</Text>

<Review>This is the place to go for tacos and mulitas in La puente. We have visited this truck based on recommendations by locals and we definitely recommend it. All the crew is on point when it comes to customer service and friendliness
They only take cash but the nearby liquor store has a ATM inside. I wish I took pictures but we ate everything 😷😋</Review><user>118151470217795143336< /user>< Rate>

Delicious food, order by phone to avoid long wait times. The best food on the menu are tostaditas of asada or torta of asada or al pastor both have very good flavor and not full of fat or nerve.<//Review>

Super fresh and gets packed fast. Everything I had was great even nacho chips tasted like homemade tortillas. Great prices bought nachos, 3 tacos, a burrito, multia all for 25. Great and well worth it. Green sauce is perfect bit of spicy, lips numb but not burning. This place is a must and I will be back.</review>

<review>Possible the BEST place I’ve ever had Asada tostadas from. The tostadas are like mini tostadas so order up. They are my absolute favorite. Tacos are good and everything else, but I always gravitate towards the mini tostada. A MUST try !!!! Their sautéed onions are also the best and the red salsa is FIRE !< /review>< date>

<Review>Wow, the food is delicious! I ordered a taco of pollo and it was juicy; not dried or hard. The taco of carne asada was cooked perfectly, not salty. The food truck isn't the prettiest one but who cares they can cook!<//Review>< GmapID>

Humble people who serve spectacular food. Tried one of every taco and all are equally tasty and flavorful. Don't forget the salsa or fried onions, they take the Taco to a whole other level!</Text>

This taco place is hands down the best in the area. Their carne asada fries are delicious and that hot sauce burns so good in my stomach that I can feel it for days. The extra grilled/seasoned onions that they give is phenomenal! They are super generous with their sides! I'll keep coming back to support this family owned establishment.</review>

Well, I asked for a chamango which was perfect but I also ordered a Razzle Dazzle without whip cream but they put the whip cream anyways. Since I don't confrontation, I took the drink home. The sad part was when my husband got mad at me for not ordering what he asked for. I thought I was finally was going to get him something he wanted for Father's Day but no, he through it down the drain. There goes my 6 dollars down the drain and I am mad at all involved: cashier for not following instruction, my husband for being ungrateful, and myself for not returning the product and getting what I asked for.<//text>

Excited to have finally tried this place! We got the chamango, mango twist smoothie, steak protein bowl, the bwaha and two corn bowls. Absolutely would recommend for anyone with a sweet tooth or interested in some yummy comfort food. Food was very fresh including the fruit and the lady working the front was very friendly and helpful even 15 min before closing. We will definitely return.< /Review>

A gem! A huge menu and my sandwich and smoothie were both great. The sandwiches come loaded with fresh veggies and toppings. If you're driving a ways to come here (or even if you're local), I highly recommend a nice little hike on the Valley View Truck Trail behind the Smart and Final (fantastic mountain views) and then pop down to Mango Twist for delicious food after.</Review>

I got the Pitaya Bowl which is like a dragon fruit sorbet I guess you can call it, with any toppings for only around $7 and it was absolutely amazing. I can’t wait to go back and get it again. They have great breakfast sandwiches and coffee/smoothies. It’s super clean and the staff is really friendly. This place is such a gem I hope it stays here forever!< /text>

<username>Natalie Fairley< /username><Text>Me and my friend decided to drive 30 minutes away to try this new place and the drive was worth it. The staff is very nice and friendly and the food was very good. The facility was clean and the wait was not long at all. I got the So Cali sandwich which came with a side of potato salad. The portions were very good and filling and the fruit was good as well. I will be coming back again!< /Text><Date>1593222449147< /Date>< Gmap_id>

I drove 30 mins for this and it was worth everything. The sandwiches are made with love! It reminds me of a good homemade deli sandwich ... I would definitely recommend the Super Cali. The fresh press juices were amazing and I got a small order of fruits and I was really expecting you know like a cup full ... no I got a whole tray of mangos, strawberries, and pineapple. Today was my first visit but definitely not my last. Also before I left (wish I could remember her name) but one of the employees was extremely generous and gave us a sample of their new strawberries and cream .... and it is to DIE FOR! Thank you so much for the great experience you’ll be seeing from me soon.</Text>

<userid>109706643006418076039< /userid><Rate>5</Rate><text>Very impressed by the larger than expected menu.
I stopped in for a smoothie and ended up getting lunch for the family....
The smoothie I ordered was thick creamy and tasted delicious. (It had protein powder in it but no chalky texture you usually are stuck with.)
Breakfast burrito was huge and I had a nice yummy bite of it. Perfect flavor and wasn’t greasy.
The BBQ sandwich was impressive. Size, freshness and flavor were all better than anticipated. I took a few little bites, and my daughter probably wouldn’t have even noticed, but I told her.
I will be coming back. 😊
Give it a try. I’m sure you won’t be disappointed.<//text><Date>1581619530771< /Date><Name>Denise Nuchols<//Name></record>

<review>Ordered a Philly cheesesteak and a cold sub. The Philly had very minimal meat and veggies. To the extent, that it felt like I was eating pain bread. The other sandwich was mediocre. The bread on both sandwiches were stale. Do not recommend.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

< review>
What a great spot. This was our first experience and the flavor was insane. I chose the western burger with sweet potato fries, while my lady got the nice guy burger and animal style tater tots.

The service was friendly and welcoming with prices reasonable and fair. We even bought some "chicken nuggets" for later. Give them a try!< /review>

I'm trying to eat less meat so I was searching for some vegetarian/vegan options in Costa Mesa. The spicy fried chicken sandwich is amazing, I can't recommend it enough. It's crispy, saucy perfection. The tater tots are beyond crunchy and the ranch is really good. You would never guess it's vegan! My order is always ready within 15 minutes, I place it online and by the time I hop in my car and drive there is ready.< /review>< Pics>

<rating>5</rating><text>The place totally lives up to the hype. I had been wanting to try since moving to the area six months ago and only recently pulled the trigger. I've gone with the Jr. Nice Burger multiple times and have literally inhaled it - the juicy patty, melty "cheese" and thousand island perfectly combine for a melt-in-your-mouth experience. Can't stop raving to my friends and recommending this as my new go-to meatless burger. Plus, you can order online for easy pickup and be served with a smile. Thanks, Nice Guys!</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCLgz9KT99h6utf6vxHARcIa9HpHEYTJdp7U1E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEG_lTf8gwlqzruHTc-nuDUL143cvG2HxN2o69=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORAma0DtOrZVtTm_6BwzLXrk0jo-d9CqyTwjAf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBvAFQbMYo54rPXBdw__NetdP9n30BwTAyamM1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaQZC81a_2Z0PmhSXlIWqeYp4ZxUMo8a7XsclA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6QxfLhJ_XlsKxWtkEZA3BzeXV-kjyf7ie0scP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUBcoftj4Yh-othhBuGH1zPufSVIu5WlfZUr2j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnSerbO1XtFBWWVi90EtnTYtFvL0jYxS9oIDvT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8kmIkKjW7LVBmwBgBUeM_9I8sr7kyam9W13-G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkOXys5a5UXPLvGXuNtDZ7CGz-hp5evMTRt7h0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dcdf429ed688c3:0xcdbd019d5fad4417<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Talk about a vegan burger. Best I have tried! I was expecting a bland burger. You know something that doesn't have so much taste, but was I wrong. They will definitely leave you wanting more.

The customer service was great. They're very friendly and helpful.

They offer outdoor seating which is awesome. Or they have take out/to go.

If you're in search for a vegan burger or vegan sandwich. Give them a try. They're worth the visit.</review><Response>None</Response>< rating>

It's a fast food joint. It's mainly proceased food.  So, why an I giving it 5 stars?  Because it's all vegan.  The food is pretty good and the people there are kind.  We had a whole bunch of different options and I would recommend their burgers with "bacon" and their tater tots.< /text>

Decent vegan option! Good sweet potato fries. Western burger was prepared fairly well. Shroom burger was even tastier with grilled mushrooms and onions. Tasty vegan sauces such as chipotle mayo. All around good experience.< /Review>

Easy to order online. Side portions are large, could be shared, but tasty.  Had the mushroom burger this time, and it was good. With many vegan food sauces tending to be nut based they can become heavy but this was not heavy at all.  Also not a greasy spoon. Will try again.<//Text>

<Date>1615872912836<//Date><Rating>3< /Rating><text>Food was okay. Had the Spicy Chicken Sandwich which was reported as very popular. I hear their vegan beef patties are better, so may try again. Also had their very average tater tots, which I loved, and their battered sweet potatoes fries which were very crispy. The malted appears to be only available in vanilla and might be made from the same stuff their soft serve is made of. Black Cherry soda tatted like it was low on syrup. Maybe just caught them on an off day. Unfortunately also ran into patrons who didn't want to cover their noses with their masks and just didn't bother with them once they were out of their store. You can really tell you're in OC here. I'm not vaccinated so I left ASAP, and probably won't return until I am.< /text>< Pictures>

The best vegetarian/vegan burgers I've ever had.  Their sides are also above average.  I'd come here just for the sides - tater tots gets a special mention..  Everything I've had was tasty.< /text>

<review>The food is great! Just went for the first time and got the jalapeño burger with fries and a lemonade and it was delicious! The fries are good the lemonade isn't too sweet. Definitely going back and excited to try different menu items. The price is also good alot of vegan places are pretty expensive but this place is priced fairly! Just be warned the parking sucks especially if its busy.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>This place was FANTASTIC!!

The food quality, the taste, the price all were amazing. The staff was also incredibly friendly, attentative and welcoming.

If you're a T Rex and enjoy animal meat, don't be fooled by the word vegan, the burgers and spicy chicken sandwiches here taste just as good and they leave you feeling full but also light (None of that heavy sleepy feeling after eating animal meat).

Highly highly recommend this place for both T-Rex (meat eaters) and Brontasaurus (vegan/vegetarian) types.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp><rate>5</rate>< Pics>

<text>Good vegan fast food in town with a good online ordering setup, good service and best of all, delicious. Tried the bbq bacon cheeseburger with all vegan ingredients and the regular fries (they also offer sweet potato fries). Will definitely be back. Comparable to the similarly configured beyond burger at Carl's Jr. but perhaps a little better. A little pricier as well, but many other options to order if desired. Worth the try if you want good vegan fast food.</text>< Pictures>

I came here and had the Mexicali burger and the chicken nuggets. It definitely hit that delicious, greasy burger craving I was having. I was impressed by all the “meats,” and while they didn’t taste exactly like a hamburger or bacon or chicken nuggets, the texture was really, really good.

The nuggets were incredibly crispy and I would describe them as what you THINK frozen chicken nuggets will be like if you’ve never had them and only saw the commercial pictures. The flavor wasn’t very chicken-y but with the barbecue sauce, you can’t tell and it doesn’t really matter.

The bacon was hard and very crispy, but not at all greasy the way actual bacon is and you could definitely tell it’s not actual meat. As a pork substitute though, I’m very impressed.

The burger itself- not very strong flavor but it was greasy and yet had a nice crisp char on one side of it. Excellent texture. I liked the burger a lot more than the nuggets.

Overall, everything was delicious. I would recommend to anyone wanting to try new plant based foods. Not a health meal for sure.</text>

This is a very interesting place to dine at. I love the sawdust on the floor and the friendly waitstaff. You can dine inside or outdoors. You can watch the chefs at work while you enjoy your meal.  The house salad, which is a caesar salad is wonderful, and I loved those house made croutons. I had the ravioli, which although the outer edge was a bit tough, had a delightful filling and the sauce was fabulous. The soup was very good too. The many other dishes looked amazing.</text>

<Text>I really like Nice Guys Vegan burgers. They truly are a wonderful group of people that work here and the delicious, cruelty free, vegan burgers, fries, tater tots, and chicken nuggets are the bomb!!💯🔥 The dipping sauces are made fresh everyday and you'll taste that when you try the tater tots or fries with them. Or get them covered with cheese and sauce. Ohhhhhhhhh😆 You get the idea! 👌😋 They use rice oil to cook the fries, tots, and nuggets and it imparts a really awesome cruchiness to the fried stuff but keeps it amazingly lite!! You WANT this!! I tell you, had these guys opened in my youthful days of devouring McD's or InNOut. Maybe I wouldn't of had a heart back in 2017. But with the Nice Guys here to stay I'm happy to have an incredible healthy, tasty alternative. The Nice Guys have been on quite a growth rate and are slowly but surely opening another restaurant/drive thru in Santa Ana. It has already opened the drive thru only. Check the website for information on the opening and operation hours of the new store in Santa Ana!! Enjoy!! 👌😉👍💯🔥🤩🤗< /Text>< gmap_id>

Stopped in mid-day Saturday afternoon - too late for brunch, too early for happy hour.  I went with the Steak & Frites. The steak was definitely good quality and flavorful. I ordered it med-rare, but it came a bit beyond medium. Nevertheless, it was still tasty.  Similarly the parmesan garlic fries were delicious, but bit undercooked -- there were a few that were crispy, those showed the true potential. Service was ok - not great, not horrible.  Overall, Basin could easily go up or down, so 4 stars.</text>

Delicious Vegan Burger. Great quality products, simple menu with only 2 options of Burger, single or double, plus fries or tater tots. Price is a little high, $11 for just the single burger + $4 regular fries plus the drink, so basically you will pay almost $20 dollars for a combo. Not cheap for sure but very good food. They have their own fountain sodas, so do not expect the regular brands at this location. Place is small and there's is usually a long line in weekends, so go during the day at week to get the best experience if you don't want to do a line. Basically no parking besides street parking in a already super crowded area, so good luck with that.< /review>

Being vegetarian and craving a chicken sandwich, i tried this tonight and it was Very good! Spicy chicken sandwich with ranch and honey mustard sauces on the side👍 I would definitely go again! Fries could have been crisper but maybe you have to ask for that here. Other wise very good substitutes! And they make their own Sodas!! Their Cream Soda was bombbbbola😋< /Text>

Decent burgers but inconsistent.  Very first time I ordered food from here it arrived completely ice cold. 2nd time,  it was good but still warm.  3rd time all food from the first order was ice cold,  which included 8 burgers, fries, and drinks.<//Text>

<review>I do not write reviews often, as they can be misleading and I genuinely don't care to leave them, but this is one of those times: y'all got to come get your nom on here. First time here, the Cali Burger is superb, and definitely worthy of having the "Cali" label. Fries are crispy and cooked to perfection, for you fry connoisseurs.

Customer service here is the best, too; shout out to Jordyn (assuming spelling, here) for helping a newbie out!<//review>< UserId.>

<text>This place is LEGIT!!! I'm a driver for a package and delivery company made a bulk delivery this afternoon...Don from Nice Guys was on fire and kicked some quick knowledge and insight on vegan food and the the benefits of this cuisine. He asked if I had lunch and offered to make me one of their sandwiches stating Vegan is the way to go and just wanted to make me one to show his appreciation for the delivery... I thanked him for using our services and was glad to do it... however, he insisted and wanted to make one for me and I thought it was a nice gesture. I'm glad he did...This "chicken" sandwich was was hot, crispy and very flavorful, the bun was perfectly toasted, the sauce was on point and pickles added the perfect crunch...you'd never know the difference between a traditional chicken sandwich and the Nice Guys version. I was truly impressed and happy with my sandwich. Congrats and continued success Don and I humbly  thank you again for my lunch today!!!< /text><Resp>None</Resp><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf429ed688c3:0xcdbd019d5fad4417< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

I was told by a non-vegan friend that the BBQ bacon burger was amazing. They were not wrong! My boyfriend, niece and I each ordered a different sandwich and all tried each other's. They were all amazing!! I think the hot chik was my favorite! I live in south county so I wish there was a location closer but I can't wait to go back.</Review>

Don’t go if you are gluten free or celiac. They really over charge you, and it’s messed up that they even charge you extra for a lettuce wrap. It’d be one thing if they could change there gloves after handling gluten. They do nothing to ensure it’s safe to eat for those with celiac disease. It’s probably good to those who arent gf, my husband liked it but said the soda was over way over carbonated and not what he expected. . I am bothered I was charged extra for food they that didn’t even handle correctly. They didn’t meet my needs for gf, however the girl running the place had friends come in, she hugged them. She went out of their way to meet their dietary needs. She should treat everyone that way.  The place looked a little rough around the edges, the outdoor dining tables were dirty. That being said the people were very busy and didn’t have time to clean.  My husband would go again, I wouldn’t unless they agreed to change gloves and treat my items with no cross contamination</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dcdf429ed688c3:0xcdbd019d5fad4417<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Went to Nice Guys 100% Vegan with my family a few days ago, and the food was amazing!

I’ve had a ton of Beyond Meat burgers over the last couple of years, but no of them were flame broiled. MAN! You need these burgers in your life!

And they are a family owned and operated restaurant and everyone is super friendly and accommodating!

They messed up our order and just kept giving us free stuff to make up for it.

We’ll be back for sure!< /Review>< name>

SO GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Literally the best vegan food I’ve ever had (and I’ve been vegan for 6 years). Sure, their hot chicken was absolutely phenomenal, but it was their staff that made my experience truly perfect. Also, they have birch beer (which I would highly recommend), a childhood favorite of mine from when I lived in North Carolina. All in all, Nice Guys is a true 10 in every sense and I recommend it to everyone I know.< /Text>

<review>Ok so my review is not based on their food (which I will be trying even though I'm not vegan but it looks awesome) but on a random incident that happened a week ago which really showed these guys superb "niceness" and caring customer service.

I apparently dropped my work phone in the giant parking lot of the Asian restaurant area on jamboree and Alton and one of the guys texted the last person on my phone and emailed me (via the notifications they saw) to let them know they left it at a coffee shop and I got it back within a few minutes.

Shout out to these guys who went out of their way to be good humans and are truly nice guys.<//review><Rating>5< /Rating><user_name>Erin Baker< /user_name></record>

The small order fed me and my girlfriend and we both eat A LOT (we workout to eat). They use USDA and prime meat only. You can really taste the quality in every single bite. The meat just melts in your mouth. The server, who also is your cook really put everything together.

Our server's name is Raymond. Raymond was extremely friendly and enthusiastic. Answered all of our newbie questions about the restaurant. He really made our first time here memorable. Thank you Raymond :) Great kid with a great personality.

We also really wanted to try the rice wine but could not drink on this trip so we will definitely be back!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

I asked about all the ingredients and surprised they got so close to all the animal ingredients with plants. It is a stellar flavor and satisfies the craving for a burger that a new vegetarian may experience, however, let's be honest, this is not healthy. It is fried in bran oil, many of the sauces have sugar added, the soy chicken has sugar added. It's still a cheat day food that you should expect to spend $15 a person. I'd probably have given a 5 star if their soy bacon didn't have a weird after taste.

My previous review had a mistake when I said: All of it is cooked in oils that aren't the best (i.e. canola). They told me that they use bran oil. I realized that I made an assumption on the type of oil.< /Text>

I had a five star review but changed it to a one star. I ordered just a sandwich no fries and they added fries for free.

Totally ruined my experience. I had to wait extra time for them, it had salt, I’m trying to lose weight. I had to listen to the stressful music for an extra 5-10 minutes when I was starved.

The way I am, if there’s food in front of me I’ll eat it. That’s just the way I am.

I realize they were trying to be nice but I’m going to try avoid this place.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>We decided to try Nice Guys based on the reviews and the 100% vegan menu. The 5 star reviews are absolutely accurate! We were greeted immediately upon entering, the staff were genuinely friendly, and the food was amazing.
We ordered the nuggets, nutzarella sticks, sweet potato and regular fries, as well as the Cali Burger. The fried foods were fried perfectly, very crispy and the burger was flawless with all the right flavor. Although we live an hour & a half away, we are already making plans to return!<//review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

This place is horrible they have a sign that says buy one a burger free and when u ask for it they try and tell u its the old restaurant when they have been here for months. I was looking forward to trying them but i will never come here for your false advertisement i am stuck in ur line as i write this and very disappointed..</review>

<Review>First of all, I'm not vegan, but this taste AMAZING!!! If you blindfolded me and had me take a bite out of these burgers and a non-vegan burger I honestly wouldn't be able to know!! This is definitely a place that everyone should try! We tried the Nice Burger (the basic burger they have) now I want to try everything else! The staff were very friendly! They were attentive and helpful!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPC7YrQc-7pJH9ZI5eUMpPQfeYNUplmIJUjUpBq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

I wanted to give them a higher rating but unfortunately, the employees (including the ones cooking our food) do not wear real face masks. they wear a plastic face shield like "mask" that does not even cover the nose. It is ridiculous and made me super uncomfortable considering they're handling food. Disappointing that with the low number of vegan chains, the number of clean ones is even lower :(<//review>

Giving Bestia 4 stars after coming back for my 2nd time (its been yeeeears since my first time). Our friends were moving out of the country and wanted Bestia one more time before moving

We were lucky to get a same day reservation online on a weeknight (we had so many dishes it's all a blur now but everything was good)
---PORK BELLY: lately I havent been into fatty meats as much but this was cooked SO WELL, some of the best pork belly I've had
---pastas: we ordered 3 different pastas, all were delicious with very unique flavors, and cooked perfectly
---alla'nduja pizza: also pretty solid

I still prefer their sister restaurant Bavel but Bestia is a solid option too!

Also luckily found parking easily on the adjacent street!< /text>

Running Goose is a Tapas Latin Fusion patio/garden Gastropub restaurant in Hollywood. We requested the large outdoor patio that's transports you far away from Cahuenga and into
a woodsy outdoor plant infused joint right in the heart of Hollywood. Since the offer an American New tapas menu, we had the dishes Corn Tostada- burnt Corn aioli, lime, basil, parsley; Tomato Tostada- charred heirloom tomato jam, queso fresco, herbs; charred Brussels sprouts; Lamb Chops- tamarind, lime, sesame, purple basil; Short Ribs- braised chipotle adobo, plaintain dumpling, pickled onions, garden herbs, queso seco; Salmon- pan roasted, eggplant mole, green beans, radish hominy-cilantro, chimichurri, lime and Horchata Creme Brûlée.  The lamb chops were delicious as was the salmon and Tostada. Everything was very tasty although the Brussels sprouts were too large, whole and not charred enough for my taste.

With the large patio that dominates the restaurant, Running Goose, unlike many restaurants in LaLaLand, should be able to stay in business during our new abnormal challenging time we find ourselves.< /text>

Edit-What was pictured is not what I received this visit. The grilled shrooms burger comes with chedder style cheese and shredded lettuce. I thought I could dodge their brand new charge for not taking the bun and wrapping it in a piece of lettuce.
I was so excited the first visit for finally not being seen as an upcharge opportunity for having an allergy.
They gave me a nice chunk of lettuce and I was pleasantly surprised. I expected the one leaf.
The food is still great, I devoured it. But tell us what we are ordering if it is a simple supply issue and please drop the charge for something that comes with it in the picture...

This place is amazing! Fresh and fast, perfect for vegans and non vegans alike. PLUS they have gluten free buns!!!<//review>

Amazing! Ordered delivery and it was VERY fast and fresh. The perfect vegan fast-food burger. I got the patty melt, no other that I’ve had before can compare.

I will definitely be a frequent repeat customer 👍</Text>

It's great seeing more plant based restaurant options in the area. This fits the "I want plant based comfort food" craving. Think fast food burger joint with plant based patties. This isn't healthy food by any stretch of the imagination, but is a spot where meat eaters and non meat eaters can come together.</Review>

<Review>My fave vegan burger joint in Orange county 😍 Why: the nice guys bacon burger, the birch beer, and the fact that you get to choose between tots, sweet potato fries, or french fries as the side. Highly recommend. They also make their own patties which imo are better than beyond burgers.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Nice Guys burgers are amazing! There is a lot of great variety. My favorite is the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, my friend's is the Nice Burger and my brother's is the Mainlander.
Out of all the options in the area I pick here and come at least once a week. The burgers are much more satisfying than those at Veggie Grill and in my opinion they're way better than Monty's. The staff is very friendly and personable. The patio is dog friendly which my dogs love.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

<Review>BOMB!!! i only know of two now vegan "junk/american food" and i was not disappointed in this find. from milk shakes to burgers and fries, they definitely give me my "fast food" fix without all the additives and guilty feeling. coming back with friends and MAKING them try because the consistency is close but personally even better than an original burger.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>The menu is simple, vegan burgers and vegan chicken, with sweet potato fries, regular friends and vegan chicken nuggets. Seating are red chairs and black tables, restrooms in the backroom, front of the place are the cashiers with digital devices and a digital menu. Friendly customer service with a hint of sense of humor; TLC can mean two things: Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes or Tender Loving Care. Delicious mouth watering food< /text><userid>107283496017946157957<//userid><Rate>5< /Rate></record>

I went in for the first time today and got the BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger, and let me just say that it was by far the best burger I've had since going meatless. I would even say it's better than the Carl's Jr. Beyond Western! And as Nic Cage would say, "that's high praise", because the Western has been my favorite burger since I was a kid. Nice Guys just does it better. Their bacon, which is absent in the Carl's Jr. Beyond Western, is amazing, both in texture and taste. Their onion rings are thick and crispy, not soggy like Carl's can be sometimes. Their Beyond meat felt truly charbroiled, which makes me wonder if Carl's just heats up their Beyond burgers instead of putting them through their charbroiler. Even their BBQ sauce is superior in my opinion. This is why I will definitely be going back to try their other burgers.<//Text>

Even from my days when I used to eat meat to my plant-based illuminated lifestyle I now have, THIS is by far the best burger I've EVER had **No hyperbole!!**. The taste is incredible as they prepare each ingredient with care and each ingredient is fresh. NO sad tomatoes, NO tired lettuce, NO droopy shrooms, bruh...please do yourself a favor and come here if not for the food, for the absolutely delightful, welcoming, and chill vibes provided by Saint Jason and the rest of the chill staff. The energy is just pure, genuine, and uplifting. Seriously, come here! you will not regret it. PS, the tots + white sauce are incredible and not even greasy or over-salted in the least. Just Tots the way they're meant to be enjoyed

Prices are kinda pricey but not really and they're not much more than other burger joints/vegan places, really< /Text>

<Review>When I first told my friends about this place, the first question they asked was, "but are they nice?" and I just laughed because it's so appropriately named! JJ is a total sweetheart and the rest of the employees actually seem to enjoy their job and interacting with the customers. That's not to even begin on the food, which is sooo tasty and hits the mark everytime - substituting a diner classic --> plant based to perfection. When i have a bad day this is the comfort food I want to eat, and dangit if they won't put a smile on yourself there nothing can. Do yourself a favor and try the cherry coke ice cream float! It's to die for 😍<//Review><Name>Raquel Kosacz<//Name></record></dataset><record>

Nice Guys serves up a super delicious veggie burger. We shared the BBQ bacon cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. The burger was hot and fresh, just enough sauce and bun to burger ratio. Loved the crispy onion rings. Sweet potato fries were served hot and extra crispy. I look forward to trying the other menu items.<//review>

Don't waste your time. They don't answer the phone more than half the time and no voicemail set up. I never leave reviews but I really felt this needed to put out there to save people's time and money. It was an emergency and I was standing outside the door and no one would acknowledge me. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU CARE ABOUT YOUR ANIMAL.</review>

They were so good to me when I had to bring my dog in to be put down. He was very old and struggling.  They also took care of his cremation.  I love this Animal Hospital. They really care for your pet.</Text>< Pics>

I've been Hunting down a good vet for my dogs and so far they didn't disappoint. They are a great friendly staff. Called a week ahead to make my pups appt as he had an ear infection, they took him in, on a timely manner, and explained to me all that was required to do. Price I was expecting to be billed around 500$ for his ear infection but it was only 201$ it included a shot for pain, an antibiotic shot, ear canal rinse for both ears, and 2  medications . Definitely coming back. Keep up the great service guys !< /Review>

Best vet in town.
All the staff is great!
I have been coming here for years.  I feel comfortable,  and everyone working here does their absolute best !
I adore Vivian,  I have been dealing with for years !
She is comforting,  caring, and the sweetest!
Ruben ?  Awesome!!!
Because of them and Dr. Branden Park ?
My little pomeranian is doing much better, and I still have her.

Friendly

Some of the girls don't communicate properly so ask questions like pricing and if RX is needed.

NexGard oral medication for fleas is about $20 per pill but requires the $45 office visit.

Visable from street, same block and side as pools as you enter Pico Rivera by 7/11. Staff very nice and offering weekend DISCOUNT due to covid 19 and curb side service. Prices are very reasonable for both dogs and cats.<//text>< rate>

<Review>It was a long time ago maybe 8 years but I had the worst experience at this place the vet was a young Asian kid. But he examined or should I say looked at my cat because he never touch held or felt my cat in the exam process. Think he was afraid of cat or was it just animal in general how can he be a vet if he’s afraid of animals never been back since and if a young Asian vet walks in pick up your pet and run. This place did not help or recommend anything to help my cat. Just had to post this it may have gotten better but I’ll never bring my family here and they are just around the corner.< /Review>< name>

<Review>I called in to ask if I can bring my pet in.  I was immediately put on hold and about 5 minutes and then told there was no availability at all, not even for emergencies.  It took her 10 seconds to tell me this and should have been done instead on wasting both of our time.</Review><user>115335125737219743053<//user>< username>

Great place. They have good prices, they are upfront with all costs, they do a great job of tracking your pets healthcare visits and they are pretty accommodating. I highly recommend taking your dog here. They also work with a few rescues as well.<//text>

This place is awesome. Have taken our Pug there twice and both were late night visits. The care the staff shows to your pets and their professionalism really puts a pet owner at ease. If you take your pet here they will be in good hands. Don't complain about prices, that's just how it goes for pet emergencies.<//Text>

I have taken all three of my dogs here. The staff is very friendly kind and understanding. They care about their clients. The doctors go above and beyond and don't give you stuff the dog doesn't need. They are conservative on their approach and truly car for their patients.  We are very happy here and my 4 legged children are as well.</Text>

I called in for a second opinion.  Told the lady in front desk the issue , very unsympathetic towards my situation.  I'm trying to find ways not to have to put my dog of 10 years down and all she can say is no our doctor is at lunch right now. Not even a call back when doctor returns from lunch. Just a thank you, have a nice day. Was very unprofessional.</Text>

Park Community is a great place to take your pet. I've used them since they first opened in Momtebello.
Always clean, super friendly staff, very helpful and caring towards my pets.
They are always will to go the extra mile to be accommodating.<//Text>

< Review>
I took my cat at the last minute she was very sick and had a lot of fleas instead of turning us away they took us at the last minute they took care of my Dayna like if she was there own.. I had to put my baby down they were very professional.
They were the best and I was very satisfied with them.  ♡♡<//Review>

<rating>2< /rating><review>Dr Park and staff are good. The facility is new and clean.The parking is very limited, and on a very busy street. They help many small to medium sized dogs. I have a big 106lb dog I took in on Saturday during the rabies shot clinic times, my big mistake. He wanted to make friends, I had to control him.They are extremely busy on weekends. Not so busy on weekdays which is ideal for my big dog. I live a few blocks away and they offer senior citizens discounts.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Hi everyone
We bring our pets here
When they need medical
Attention or vaccinations
The staff is friendly.
It's convenient and clean and their
Prices are not to steep
We all know how pricey animal Care
Can be
So thumbs up from me<//Text>< Rate>

<Review>I had the unfortunate experience of bringing my pet here to be put down. I called the day before to get a quote and I was given a price of $60 I called again the day of and I was given a price of $65 and I questioned and said why did the price change they said that the price was based on poundage my dog weighed 19 lb I passed it off as a misunderstanding and brought my Harley in the day of when I walked in and arrived again I was quoted a price of 65 they then dropped it on me that there was a $45 charge to put the IV in it kind of hit me hard because I'm not a wealthy man but it was for my Harley so I went ahead and told him okay one of the staff members that came into the room told me that I would get a paw print along with it and I asked him there's no extra charge in front of my mom and my son who were both in the room with me and the gentleman said no no extra charge so I said awesome thank you very much the doctor then came in and was very polite and very proper but couldn't speak a lick of English I did the best I could understanding what he was saying and what he was trying to communicate to me he was an Asian man I even pointed out the fact that my son is half Chinese being that his mother is from Taipei moving forward the doctor administered the medication and our dog was put to sleep we were in there for about 15 to 20 minutes saying our goodbyes after he went down and then I came outside to the front desk to pay for the services expecting a bill of about $100 being that I have been quoted $65 for the euthanasia and $45 for the ivy line so to my surprise I was floored when they handed me a paper with a bill of $190 to which I asked why is it so much this is not what I was quoted. The receptionist would not make any eye contact with me and simply said that's what we usually charge and I repeated this is not what you guys quoted me when I walked in nor when I was in the room how can you guys do this to a person going through a situation such as mine where I have lost a highly loved member of our family, her response was "who told you it was 65?", To which I responded "you did" and then I told her that the gentleman inside had told me I would get a paw print included at no charge for which the charge was now $50 on top of the cost of the euthanasia I was now cornered into buying this because my son and my mother who are both sobbing next to the body of our deceased pet we're expecting to see a paw print keep in mind I'm a man of meager means barely scraping by. At this point I had no choice but to Fork over the money to which the nurse went in the back and came back and quoted me now $170 I asked for the euthanasia pricing chart wondering if they had it in writing to which the nurse responded I can write it down if you like I told her don't you guys have it in writing and she said no we don't there was some funny business going on here and I can't believe that they would do this to somebody that's going through such a traumatic experience my ten-year-old was crying, my mother whose 84 was crying, and I myself am 6 ft 9 and was tearing up and crying like a baby as well, and then for them to Sock It To Me the way they did was just wrong on so many levels I plan on reporting them to whatever agency I can as soon as I do some research because what they did with their pricing was ridiculous not to mention that I have two witnesses that were there with me who heard them quote me the prices Park Community Animal Hospital SHAME ON YOU!!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOixEMdhfapEP6nbKLYhymRJD7Wz_o11vTv96JS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaRM992jSt0-GQlSOvhgAo1NidhHsYJCAZNw2w=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

I don't necessarily live in the area anymore but I still bring my pet here. I trust the staff and doctors at Park Community hospital! I guess when you trust a place, you don't mind the extra 5 mile drive to get there. The facility is always clean, the equipment is modern, they always find out what's wrong with my Maddy and take care of the issues. They make sure that I leave feeling that my concerns have been met. Maddy says "woof woof woof woof woof!" for 5 stars! LOL<//text>

I was referred to this hospital by a guy at Petco. A lil far from home but well worth it. Took my baby Samantha to get vaccines and it so happened it was their discount vaccine day. Clean place, modern, excellent staff. This is Sam's new vet. I recommend it 100%.<//review>

I pray for God to use the Veterinarian hands since the best Doctor is God, of course he left the science to be available to us.  This clinic is the best this is the 2nd time that had taken my dog to this place for the same problem in a year between.  He got cure the same week in both ocassion. I hardly recommend Park Community Animal they treat our mascot with compassion. I thank God to use the Vet to cure my dog.

< review>
Two days before Thanksgiving 2016 our 7 yr old female Doberman Lucy lost the use of her back legs. I was devastated. I had no idea what could have happen. She wasn't doing anything out of her normal routine. That evening She was climbing onto the couch when her back legs buckled under her and she dropped to the floor.  The next morning I called and got her an appointment. Moving her was like picking up a hundred pound water balloon. She was totally paralyzed from the waist down.
Once at the vets they were very caring and patient with her. After multiple x-rays and a blood test, We were told she had about 10℅ feeling in her toes and her chances of recovery at that time was 50/50 but with each passing day that would drop.  They spoke to us concerning her quality of life if she didnt show any improvement but I couldn't imagine terminating her life just because she couldnt walk.  I know they were right but at that moment it wasn't acceptable to me.
She was given (Prednisone) steroid +pain+muscle treatment thru an IV . This was a two part treatment, but the next day was Thanksgiving  so we took her home with meds and she got her second IV treatment the day after Thanksgiving.
I made a loop out of PVC and padded it so I could support her back end allowing her to walk on her front legs because she still had control of her bowels.  But it took me a few days to come up with this contraption so I was unaware her loss of bladder control was from a urinary tract infection
.  Having never seen a female dog with a UTI l though she was dying.  Even though I would immediately clean her up after she made a mess the Dr explained to me that a female's bladder is very close to the outside of her body. So no matter how fast I cleaned her up bacteria had already entered her.
At that vet visit I was beside myself . We had already spent the close to a thousand dollars and I did the know how we were going to pay for another visit.  Dr Joon was so thoughtful and understanding.    He really cared and the help he gave me brought me to tears.
Dr Joon and Ruben made lasting impression on me.   I'll never take my animals anywhere else.  The entire staff was amazing.  I cannot say enough good things about them.

As for Lucy, ...Well Dr Joon told me it was worth a shot to take her to a chiropractor or seek treatment that were outside the realm of his expertise. .  I took her to Friend of ours who practices Chinese medicine.   Between the steroids (which made a huge difference I her overall body strength) and the help of our friend,. Lucy is walking again .    God bless the staff at park community for their excellence and dedication to the work they do.  I believe they helped me emotionally as much as they did Lucy physically.

I highly recommend this vet to everyone.< /review>

They do whatever it takes to charge you more. They charged me twice for a single round of shots, when I tried to confront them about it, they said it wasn't true and sent me on my way. Horrible customer service!</review>

Dr Bloom is one of the best ER doctors I’ve had and I’ve seen plenty due to my ongoing health issues. The nurses and staff are always friendly. The wait time is always long but it’s an ER so that’s expected. Overall, I’m happy with the care I receive there.< /Text>

Adventist Health treats patients very inconsistently as evidenced by the reviews.  Some talented health care professionals struggle under exceptionally incompetent management.  The support and quality assurance department is nonsense, referring Google Maps reviewers to a non-responsive email. Simply not a safe place for most Lake Country  residents. Hospitals are best when run by professionals with an understanding and trust of science. Not the case here.  Note the snarky response below. So far gone that their only response to patient problems is sarcasm.</Review>

Adventist health has brought subpar Healthcare to lake county. I cannot stress enough how much they don't care about you as a person. They came in and completely ruined a well oiled machine of a doctors office.
And to gain even less service they try to make you happy by having an automated system give you an email asking you to email your concerns. Sorry robot you can stay with the automated bs.<//review>

HELP!  This “Place” needs Management! You make an appointment, drive there and they say,”No, you don’t have an appointment”! After the third time it’s just ridiculous. Last time they asked if I could prove I had an appointment and I produced the card with the appointment. Absolutely Ridiculous! Their experience coordinator, Gaberiela Carmona has an answering machine for you to leave a message! Hogwash! How many people are being lost to their mismanagement?

I only gave it one star because there was no way to do ZERO. This is the second time ( two different people) of having to go there. I won’t go into details but if anyone wants my story I’d be glad to give it. My doctor told me “they finally did something right”, I asked what ? She said “they sent you somewhere else “. Which didn’t happen to the other person.<//Review>

The denatl part is ridiculous!!! The dentist tells you one thing the lady Jessica that answers the phone says something different! I feel Jessica is very very rude! Doesn't even try to help with appts or anything scheduled way far out but if you walk into the office you'll get a sooner appt! The kids with a higher need should not be pushed out 2 months!<//Review>

I've had two out-patient procedures, MRI, x-rays plus my first trip as a patient to the ER at Adventist Health Hospital Clearlake where I felt that the Hospital did their very best in taking care of me.

I've lived in Clearlake since 1969 and have used the services at the Hospital where I have to say that their services, Dr's, nurses and departments and employees are most gracious and loving to see to your needs. I realize that not all visits go as  we feel they should but we need  to have patience and loving ways also as a patient (we're not the only one there) for treatments or tests.

Adventist Health Medical Center have very polite admission workers who do their very best in pointing patients to the right Dr. for their needs, setting up appointments for your next visit and admits you in a  timely manner, very little waiting time until your name is called to see a Dr. or your primary physician.

My brother was admitted to the hospital in Feb. 2014 due to high ammonia levels as a complication of Cirrhosis.  He stayed there for a week and was well taken care of...they would not release him too early as hospitals tend to do these days.  He has been doing fine since.  Since then my brother and SO have had visits to emergency room. All times problems were resolved and we were treated well.  Don't understand the bad reviews.  We were very satisfied with the care received.<//Text>

Horrible experience with Amanda McRae, Medical Assiatant. I was calling to request a review of my 77 year old mother's medication, and she immediately was rude and abrupt, refusing to listen. Her altitude was extremely harsh. Before the call was accelerated to a manager, she cut me off  by putting me on hold mid sentence. How and why she was hired to assist people who are sick is questionable! Please provide her with Basic customer service training, or fire her ...she is not a decent representation of your organization.< /review>

If you need emergency care/other wise/Sutter Lakeside is your best bet...our family have lived in LAKE COUNTY since 1958...I won't get into the particulars/it will be long and drawn out/and it won't be very good...changing the name didn't help the service or the reputation...anything major/go elsewhere...medical costs are astronomical/ and outrageous...do get good care for your money...<//review>

My medical records are inaccurate. While hospitalized, I was told by my nurses to press my call button when my pain medication was due. Apparently, they were extremely busy. Well... I did just THAT. Imagine my surprise when my new primary care doctor informed me that my records said I kept asking for a certain pain reliever! NOT TRUE. Now it's MY word against theirs? THIS should be illegal to falsify my records. Now, any doctor that I go to see, will pull up that incriminating entry. I WILL find a way to make them accountable if they do not add a ADDENDUM.</text>

I had a fever of 103 for two days straight was given something to reduce it which was nice and then I had an influenza swab done. So I wait for 4 hours come to find out some guy with an Ingrown hair was seen before me. I get it dont be a snob but come on, WHERE IN THE WORLD OR WHEN IN THE WORLD DOES AN INGROWN HAIR COMPARE TO A HIGH GRADE FEVER LASTING LONGER THAN 1 DAY. Come to find out in that 4 hour time frame that I indeed tested POSITIVE for a strain and had no clue what it was thanks to your poor decision skills.

Adventist Health in Clearlake is nothing like the old reputation And by the so-called redbud hospital.   The emergency room has he been completely rebuilt and the attention given is far greater in my opinion then Sutter in Lakeside Lakeport.

In addition there is a heliport and my husband was immediately transferred to Adventist Health in St. Helena which is a superb institution with residential rooms for family members, wonderful food beautiful environment, landscaoe.

Entire medical system needs reform so please do not blame some problems on this one hospital or overworked doctor as they are all in trouble.  Now Specialists cannot see an ER  referral  for up to two weeks after they leave the emergency room door.   Apparently they receive 30 referrals a day. And there are not enough days in the week for the specialist or surgeon  to immediately see all patients.   It is broken!    We really need to take charge of our  own  health, kearn about preventative medicine and health as far as nutrition exercise etc. I have personally seen many caring nurses and doctors doing their best in Today’s difficult field of medicine.</Review>

Their incompetent, unprofessional staff at the psychiatric wing will hold a healthy, nonviolent person for an indeterminate amount of time without a medical justification. Do not go to theses idiots. They lose charts, misspell names, and keep the place dirty.< /review>

<text>I've seen some really messed up stuff in here, they treat almost everyone like an addict, I've seen there security yell threatening at people with who were there with psychiatric issues and. I've seen them make fun of patients while standing around(literally like 8 of them hanging out in one spot while someone asks over and over for a blanket and act like it's a strain) this place is awful left here when to Lakeport and they are freaking awesome there.<//text>< rating>

<review>My mom fell down on 4th of July she broke her nose and Humurus (arm) bone . Shes 78 mind you . Well they released her 2 hours after she was brought to the ER She hit her head when she fell no cat scan , no chest xrays.  Now we sit in the lobby a week later so she can have those xrays . We've been here over an hour . There was no room for her in the xray  lobby so we are sitting in the hallway waiting for someone to come get her for these xrays.  Unbelievable.. I have to say I have had the worse luck with this hospital update:: my mom is doing much better no thanks to Adventist Health(Redbud)< /review>< resp>

This is the worst place ever! And I'm very sick with bad health and I get so sick to where I vomit continually and get dangerously low on blood and fluids and the sent me away still vomiting chronically and treated me like a drug seeking addict and I didn't even ask for any controlled substances, my mom had to drive me to lakeport and ended up.  Being flown to sutter Sacramento ICU cause I was bleeding eternally from violently vomiting!! I can't believe they sent me away so sick without doing anything test! Lakeport was the best and took good care of me while I was there waiting to be transported! Believe me go to lakeport</Review>

<text>I went to their emergency room. They were kind enough to me and got to me right away that day. For that I wanted to give 2 stars but looking back after everything they didn't do much else for me. They didn't do the testing that most other places likely would've done, and they grossly overcharged for it all. Please, go to Sutter in Lakeport if you can.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

If I could give half a star rating I would.  This is the truth (after working here 5 wasted years): chronic understaffing to pinch pennies while lavishing physicians with various perks and massively overcompensating physicians, staff gossiping about one another and management only being concerned with finances, an outdated, inefficient charting software for all staff that slows care down, an ER that shuffles people though like a conveyor belt (sanitize the bed; then fill it; repeat every 40 minutes), lack of education given to patients, a management that will not terminate incompetent staff and overlook blatantly dangerous mistakes that have resulted in injury and worse, rude receptionists (from the operator to the individual departments), arrogant physicians that ignore patient and staff concerns (one ER doc threw a book at a nurse and she threw something back at him: good for her), terrible cleaning of OR suites by housekeeping staff that is IGNORED, curtains that are NEVER washed or changed when a patient has MRSA or other particularly harmful infections, nosy staff that laugh at patients behind their back openly at the nursing station (and each other), nurses that sit on their derrieres while patients legitimately require something, and complacent managers (well actually they care about the statistics and budget-that's it).  I sympathize if you have had to experience this Clearlake catastrophe; the only thing you can do is warn others and never return.  FYI: I was a nurse there and no, management did not like me because I tried to improve the place and brought up problems we had in department meetings.  Once I dared ask the Medical Director, "Why aren't we referring patients with addiction problems to a program that can help them get off this stuff so they don't keep coming back into the ER with drug withdrawal problems?"  His reply was, "And how do you think the hospital will make money that way?"  I wish I was kidding.  High surgical infection rates, rude staff, inadequate treatment in general....this is just off the top of my head.< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><review>They went to fix my flat and didn’t tell me my tire was worn down to the wire. Didn’t even fix the flat. Was leaking really bad even right out of the shop. Had to go to big brand just to tell me my tires were bad. I called them back and they started yelling saying it wasn’t their problem. Do not go here. My friend told me they took his wheel spacers off and his wheels started rubbing. They kept the wheel spacers that he payed for and wouldn’t give them back.</review>< Pictures>

Took my truck in to have the front struts replaced and have an alignment done.  After I drove it home and looked at the truck, the camber on the front tires didn't look right.  Took it back and they made it right.  Nice staff and prompt service.< /Review>

If I could put zero stars I would this place is terrible. The worst customer service I have ever dealt with, they don’t do anything they say they will do, and don’t care about the customer needs and nothing is ever their fault. STRONGLY RECOMMEND NOT DOING BUSINESS WITH THE TULARE STORE.<//Text>

<text>Ive been going to Westcoast tires since they opened up in Tulare. I got 4 cars and trucks and have had work done on both brakes and tires. Chris has always gave me a good to excellent price. And as far as service goes, Rudy is the man. I have a very rare classic car that has discrepancies in specs, so he personally drove to my mechanics house to measure for fitment. I drive nice cars and am very picky. And have always left happy!</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<Text>Called to get some prices to get a stereo installed in my car, customer service is not good. Seems like they have better things to do than answer some questions than help a potential customer. Rude service, would not recommend  to anyone to use them.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80952b8bf69ade13:0x3f595671260ac3f5< /gmap_id>< rating>

We were in need of a tire and they didnt have it and we didnt really have money either so he suggested we go to walmart and buy a tire at walmart and bring it to them and they could put it on. Thank god we needed it.</text>

Now,that there is a store in Tulare was a win win situation for me, Rudy,Chris and the rest of the staff always go above and beyond when it comes to service and price no mater what your situation is, I would highly recommend West Coast Tire to anybody.< /text>< pictures>

Good drinks for a reasonable price, and Karaoke with decent singers. I like it a lot when Flora is here, but it's still good when she isn't.< /review>

<Text>This is place is fun, came here for my first time visiting San Francisco & it was great. The drinks are good & the music was lit. The crowd is super friendly & there are drag queens & dancers on the little stage. It is a bit small, so its tight, but that wasn't an issue. Definitely going to be coming back!<//Text>< Pictures>

Karaoke Wednesday's are fun. Everyone was polite and the crowd was friendly as hell. Thank you guys, you guys, that kindness goes a long way. Thanks to KJ Cole, Remy, and bartender Sabrina and the other awesome chick who found my money that I dropped 👍<//Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Pretty fun spot as far as gay bars go. The space is pretty modern, the crowd is young, and the music is fun. There's a center stage where they usually have dancers and a back room, which tends to be less crowded if you want to just hang out with friends. Cash only, so be sure to grab some from the ATM before going in. Covers can get relatively expensive for the area.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

One of the best clubbing experiences I have had. My friends and I went in expecting a good time with high expectations and we came out more than satisfied. The place was packed with amazing and friendly workers and customers. Definitely gonna go back with friends with high expectations! The place can get pretty hot and crowded but if you're planning to go clubbing...what do you expect? =]<//Review>

< Review>
My friends and I were really looking forward to going to The Cafe and we had heard great things about it. Unfortunately, the bouncer was a HUGE A**HOLE. My friend handed him his REAL NJ ID and the bouncer immiately said “well, well what kinda fake ID do we have here?” My friend proceeded to show him FOUR other forms of identification including his school ID, debit card and insurance card. The bouncer scanned his ID, black lighted it and bent it and obviously it passed every test because it was real and he was actually 21. After all that the bouncer threatened to take it. The major problem was that if he had taken my friends ID, my friend would not have been able to get on his flight back to NJ. After all of that, the bouncer finally gave it back but then another bouncer insisted on searching all of our bags even though we obviously were not going into the bar. It was absolutely ridiculous. I highly suggest hiring a new bouncer who doesn’t have it out for every young person coming into the bar. SF is a huge tourist place and obviously there are people coming from out of state. EDUCATE YOURSELF ON WHAT REAL OUT OF STATE IDS LOOK LIKE! I will never come back to this bar and I will advise against anyone with an out of state license coming here.< /Review>

Nice place with good drinks. This place was really great in the 90's when the castro was actually fun... and it still is I guess I when you are a young buck! But over all this is a nice establishment with great service!</Text>

Good music. Fun atmosphere. However, home to THE WORST BARTENDER in history. Rude, nasty and got our drinks wrong. After asking her politely not to make our vodka tonics with sprite she just pushed our second round of "vodka sprites" at us while yelling over my head for the next customer. I asked for a round of green tea shots which she said she did not know how to make. I told her how and she told me they sounded disgusting and refused to make them! I was with a group of people and each of them complained about how rude she was. I won't be going back if she's bartending<//Review>

I would say that this place does not compare to a typical night in West Hollywood but it certainly comes close. Over all a great night with lots of dancing.</Review>< Pictures>

A club is a club is a club. Not a big fan of clubs but wanted to check it out. The stars are mostly for the go go dancers. Good size for tightly packed SF.</text>

<review>I remember while i was drinking a triple expresso outside that back in 1973 they had filmed an episode of the Streets of San Francisco across in the parking lot. But my expierence having a mouth watering Turkey Burger accompanied by a full green salad was all i could dream of. Plus the locale was cool to very low incognito away from the hustle and bustle stay where you are.</review>< pictures>

This place is fun depending on who you come with. I've had a different experience each time so I can't really determine the actually rating. However, the last time I went they started charging for cover, which I think is absolutely ridiculous.< /Text>

“What’s not to like” gush groupies of this “entertaining” Castro dance club where “excellent DJs”, “friendly” bartenders and a “fabulous” space make for a “wonderful” place “to dance the night away”; an “eclectic”, “young” crowd – largely “but not necessarily gay” most nights – pays a “cheap” cover to “mingle” at themed events like Thursday’s Latino night and Sunday’s drag show.</Text>

I've been here about 3 times and each time it's pretty enjoyable.

A list on the place:
1) It's fun !!!!
2) Mostly guys : not really a queer/lesbian place, if that's your think try cockblock,el rio and the lexington (probably closed now)
3) Boy bar is the best night : really attractive men dancing in underwear
4) Drinks are normally priced
5) It doesn't pick up till about 11pm +
6) There is a cover of usually $5<//text>

(Translated by Google) If you are looking for a place to dance hip hip and Latin music, here you dance so much that they almost always end up throwing people out of the club because everyone wants to stay haha. I definitely recommend it, it's super fun

Si estás buscando un lugar donde bailar hip hip y música latina, aquí se baila tanto que casi siempre terminan botando a la gente del club pq todo el mundo se quiere quedar jaja. Definitavemente lo recomiendo, es super divertido</review>

(Translated by Google) The truth is that I am quite demanding and I get screwed to make me pay on the sites when I see that the locals are not charged. I think they should change their company policy and start charging only the cups and putting them as in my country, with foundation.

(Original)
La verdad es que soy bastante exigente y me jode que me hagan pagar en los sitios cuando veo que a los locales no les cobran. Creo que deberian cambiar su politica de empresa y empezar a cobrar solo las copas y ponerlas como en mi pais, con fundamento.</text>

The WIN Home team have us a great experience. The team arrived on-time. Their inspection was handled professionally and with a great deal of thoroughness. The team went over the house from top to bottom and gave us a thorough and accessible run down of their findings. The formal report was delivered same-day. All and all, a great experience and we'd use WIN again.<//Text>

From scheduling the inspection to delivery of the report, WIN Home Inspection was professional and thorough.  The inspectors went over the report with my client at the property and explained their findings.  I will definitely be referring Erica Miller and WIN Home Inspections along with her amazing team of inspectors again.<//Review>

WIN company is a team of pros i would not only recommend but will hire again on future project. The team was professional, responsive, and experienced. The inspection team identified issues, made recommendations, and delivered a report within a short time after the inspection.< /review>

The inspection was thorough and the inspector professional, knowledgeable, and communicated well with me on request. I spoke with the owner of the business by phone, and she was very polite and professional. The price, in my experience, is somewhat on the high side (I paid 40% less to inspect a SFR in Riverside in June of this year vs. a manufactured home in Beaumont).  The only other issue was too many requests for a company review -- I've received 4 requests to do so in less than 30 hours from when the inspection took place.</Review>

Dennis and Steve showed up right on time. They went right to work. After they  checked
everything they went over areas of concern. Very informative and knowledgeable. Would definitely recommend. Pricing was very reasonable also.  My only complaint is I didn’t hear the Donald Duck impression !!!</Review>

<Review>Amazing customer service. Erica scheduled the inspection and couldn’t have been friendlier (even when I needed to change the date of the inspection at the last second 😬). Our inspector Dennis was professional, thorough and when I had questions about the inspection report and tried calling him, he answered the phone, after hours, while he was watering his plants in his backyard, and answered any and all of the questions or concerns I had about the property in question. Couldn’t be happier with the service from WIN Home Inspection. Oh and side note: Dennis does pretty good Donald Duck impression (the kids loved it!!)< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1597437284717, 'text': 'Thank you Josh.

I've been using WIN Home Inspection for over 4 years now and have  always confidently referred them to my clients for their home inspections. Everyone I've worked with at WIN Home Inspection has been very professional, yet personable and we receive the reports in a timely manner.< /text>

Our situation was a little unique in that we were actually the back-up offer.  We were able to purchase a copy of the report from the original inspection.  Dennis was available to answer all of our questions and give us insight to the seriousness of each identified issue, since we were not at the inspection.  We were extremely impressed with his knowledge and helpfulness!< /text>

This company helps me sell homes in that the inspections are so thorough and complete, that the buyers are comfortable and happy with the represented condition of the mobile home that I am selling. As a 31 year veteran mobile home dealer, I highly recommend Win Home Inspections!</Text>

I have used WInn home inspection for many years . Recently had a problem  with an inspection brought up by a buyer and I took the situation to Erica  without any hesitation it was handled with professionalism and in a timely manner. Erica is great with my clients and went above and beyond to make this client feel like she cared and they were very happy with the outcome. I can always count on a good inspection and they stand behind their report. I highly recommend them . Thanks again Erica for your help .  Jennifer Underwood< /Text>

Realtor recommended I use Dennis with Yucaipa WIN Inspection for my home inspection. His price was comparable to others in the area and he spent all the time that was needed to make me feel the job had been completed correctly.
The home inspector that inspected my previous home was not nearly as detailed or helpful to answer my questions and concerns.
Dennis spent an extra 30-45 mins with me trying to figure out why 1 electrical outlet would not work, what was wrong with the closet lights and most of the time was spent trying to simply figure out how an exterior light functioned.
They spent nearly 2 hours looking over every nook and cranny. I would recommend them to anyone in the area</Review>

<review>Paloma was amazing and Nima was fabulous getting us approved. Great communication throughout the buying process. They made buying a car so enjoyable in comparison to the other dealerships we had tried to work with for the two weeks prior. We came from Arizona to buy from them and will be back the next time we are in the market for a vehicle. Fast and efficient and got us into the car we wanted.<//review>< Pictures>

Really great hassle free car buying experience.  Ali quoted me a price over the phone and when I showed up, the lower than MSRP price was real, unlike another dealer I shopped (see McKenna VW).  Thanks for making it so easy!</Text>

I cannot help but feel like I was overcharged for service by 💯. This breaks my heart. I wish dealer service pricing didn't feel like a bath. It just makes me think what ever they are charging like going into the hospital. It could be done for at least 1/2 the amount they are going to charge me. It's the American way now. The grift. It's depressing.<//Text>

Probably the best car buying experience I've had thus far. Santiago was an excellent salesman - personable, straightforward, and easy to work with. I did not at all feel pressured to buy a car, and was given the time needed to make my decision. I worked with Chris in the Financing department, and he was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions, many of which were quite specific. Overall, I am very happy with the service I received - VW of Santa Monica has certainly earned my business.< /Text>

Best Dealer I Have Ever Done Business With
Special thanks to Paloma (my sales rep) and to the General Manager who has been working at the location for more than 10 years for a reason.
Experience through some dealers when looking for a car might go wrong. Some lie a lot, some are very pushy, some cant keep their promise and etc. At the end, we all know most of the dealers are last group of people we wanna do business with.
Surprisingly my experience with SM VW was awesome. They were super nice, kind, not pushy, kept their promise, accepted CC payments, didnt make bothering phone calls, responded my texts on time. They even gave me a loaner during 4-5hr repair time without I asked for one. This is the type of dealer I would definitely come back for a newer car in the future. Again, thanks Paloma.</Text>

I really can't thank this place enough for all the help they have given me with my GTI. Every situation is different but its nice to have real people to work with who look out for you and your car.< /Text><rate>5</rate>< gmap_id>

Bridget Stennis made the whole experience of choosing and purchasing a new car a quick and painless process. She made certain everything, especially the financial terms were to our liking, and clearly explained.

I first encountered Volkswagen Santa Monica's exemplary attention to detail in 2011, so on our return to Los Angeles after six years away in New York,  they were automatically our first stop for the purchase of our car. You should definitely make them yours.< /Text>

<review>We bought my daughters 2009  VW EOS used from Santa Monica VW .After 1 year and only a few thousand miles the car began breaking down. Small issues at first then after thousands of dollars chasing overheating, stalls on the freeway and a faulty passenger side airbag , we gave up on this vehicle as the bills were more than the car was worth. Needless to say, Santa Monica VW kept taking the car in and charging the $180 for diagnostics, while the same issues continued to pop up again and again. Bottom line, VW of America and Santa Monica VW did absolutely nothing for us except continue to charge the credit card! I will never buy another VW and certainly never darken the door of  this dealership again. If you value honesty and integrity I strongly recommend you go somewhere else!<//review>< gmap_id>

< Review>
The manger of this branch is an Asian man, I don’t know his name, but he wears suits that are too big for him a few sizes and he needs to check his attitude at the door when he goes to work. I leased car from them but there was a error on the paper work and he came, without even acknowledging my presence, slammed on the keyboard to fix it, did a big annoyed heavy breathing from his nostrils and left the office without saying one word. If I had not signed the papers already I would have canceled the deal. Dogs are treated better at the pound than this.< /Review>

<Review>Paloma at SM VW just guided my girlfriend and I through getting a new jetta together. Working with Paloma was an absolute pleasure. She made the entire process as smooth and easy and stress free as getting a new car possibly can be. She is a total pro, very respectful, and in no way “salesy.” We love our new car and will definitely go back to VW SM for future cars as well. Highly highly recommend Paloma for anyone looking for a new car and a truly great salesperson.< /Review>< Time>

Brought Tiguan for service. Phone appointment 0915 was a breeze. Peyman helped me at service department. He was pleasant, personable & efficient. He provided me an Uber ride for home instead of waiting. He called me for 11am as vehicle ready.< /Review>

The service department was remarkably fast but the service charges to install a battery and to add some AdBlue to my vehicle's AdBlue tank is ridiculously over the top. I was charged 84 dollars to have my car's battery installed. I would've rather had them hand me the battery and I could've installed it myself. I was charged nearly 20 dollars to have someone poor some AdBlue into the AdBlue tank. That's like paying 20 dollars to have someone pump your gas. I think the service department is very efficient but to charge those kinds of prices to pour some fluid into a tank and install a car battery is ridiculous.< /Review>

My wife and I went through our first car purchase here with their saleswoman Bridget. The whole process was so easy and friendly and painless. Bridget was an absolute joy to work with and she was very kind and helped us through every step of the way. We are so glad it went so well and they've set the standard for us for buying cars in the future.</text>

<Review>I came to the dealership  11:30, Vanessa greeted us and helped us out. Loved it. But to a certain extent. She first lost the key to the other car in storage so we couldn’t get our car because there were like five cars infront of it ( very unprofessional of them), it took roughly about an hour or so to find it. And then paper were signed. Then we were told to the car would BE READY in one hour, which much inspected, detailed, and all that good stuff. We went to go get lunch and it took us about one hour and thirty mins. When we came back we were told to wait another hour. She lied. It had been about two hours and she kept telling us 40 mins to one hour. They wasted our time. They we very unprofessional, never been too a dealership that was this unprofessional.</Review><userid>102794351151118477895</userid><Date>1603606742897</Date><rating>1<//rating>< pictures>

I’m not a big review guy, but the experience i had with your service center really makes me want to write it.
My brother and I brought our Golfs to your center for the past 3 years, it has always been great, but the attention you guys brought to my GTI for all the issues it had recently was just amazing.
I had to bring the car for a big maintenance, weird noise in the front wheel and after that the battery died the next week.
From A to Z, the service advisors Luke Young and Eric Goodrich took care of me and really helped me get everything solved on the most convenient, efficient and economical way for me.
I really appreciate being treated like that.
Not every business has this type of ethics, honesty and recognition for their customers, but you guys do.

Good job Volkswagen , and thank you very much to the nice lady that welcomed me each time, Eric, Luke and the team that worked on my car !
You have my loyalty as a customer.

<Review>Hola Hola !!! VolksWagen Santa Monica made my day this past Sunday !

The story starts when a couple of weeks ago I stopped by to check if I was able to trade my Jetta Sport for a Eos Convertible. Brian Demoy was who helped me and he was very cool and understanding about what exactly I wanted. I gave him my information and walked out very hopeful. A few "long" days passed by and while being happy with my Jetta driving around I thought "they probably forgot about me" ... and I continued with my day only to know that two days after that I received a phone call from Brian Demoy about having the Eos at the dealer waiting for me. I immediately jumped of happiness and was schedule to go and have a Sunday Funday at the Volkswagen Santa Monica - The Best Place - to spend your day!. I was there a bit early and right away after parking my beautiful Jetta I walked to my more beautiful Eos Convertible. Brain Demoy was not there yet and when I walked in to the dealer I was so happy that I started to hug everyone good morning and happy Sunday :). While doing that I met Andrew Morais who started to help me while we were waiting for Brian Demoy. We tested drive my new AweSome car around the block and when we arrived Brian Demoy was the kindness coming to help me/us and I ended up having the best service from him and Andrew Morais, all together they make such a GREAT TEAM. Brian Demoy and Andrew Morais were kind, sincere, great sales agents and so helpful in making my experience great and fun. Also I must said that they were very patient with me and always making sure everything for me was clear and that I was understanding step by step the whole process of the sale/trade. Then I met Chandler Rabens  such a sweet finance Bonita !!! She was who gave more magic to my exciting experience in explaining me how lucky I am by being the new owner of a Volkswagen Eos Convertible <3. She handled all super professional as well and it was very direct and open with everything about my new car. Everyone at the Volkswagen Santa Monica were the greatest in giving me the BEST HAPPY SERVICE ever!!! ~ GRACIAS ~ :)

CATALINA a happy Volkswagen Owner !

What an awesome experience! From start to finish it couldn't have been better. Anything Lynn Williams could do to make our exerience an easy one, he did immediately. He provided quality and skillful service. Fast, friendly, no-nonsense. Hands down the best car buying experience we've ever had.
I was interested in buying  a pre-owned Tiguan and  he sent specs on all the available ones... the whole process was handled via text and email. When we chose the exact car we wanted Tammer in financing was  efficient and invaluable. Tammy Weaver, the manager, equally so.
Finally, Lynn even DELIVERED the car (and the paperwork) to us, with a bow on top, I might add!!!
We'll be back and we will be sending our friends.</Review>

I have just purchased my second vehicle from VW Santa Monica. The first experience in 2018 was great, and this one was also fantastic! The salesman, Santiago who helped me secure the vehicle was incredibly helpful and found exactly what I was after, which was hard given restrictions due to COVID. The protocols they have in place due to COVID also were very appreciated, keeping everyone as safe as possible!

If you’re after a VW hit up Santiago.</text>

BUYER BEWARE: I was blatantly lied to by the sales manager about the condition of the certified preowned VW I bought at this dealership in March. They told me that what appeared to be rust on all four wheels was just dirt, and then admitted after selling me the car that it was in fact rust. First off, why does a VW certified preowned car have rust in the first place? This is red flag number one at this dealership. I wanted to return the car the next day, once it was confirmed they lied to me about the condition of the vehicle. VW North America has since admitted to me that they should have done the right thing and let me replace it with something else, but instead VW Santa Monica put up all kinds of resistance and told me there is "nothing" I can do about it...

These people will lie as much as possible to sell a car, and not think twice about it, and it starts with upper management. The GM, Tammy Weaver, could not care less when she was made aware of the unethical sales practices of her sales manager, Paul. The culture at this dealership is to make the sale at any cost, and if you're considering buying a VW, please do yourself a favor and go to another VW dealership. This location does not understand the value of doing business the right way, or care about the reputational cost of their sales malpractice.

Carpe Diem at this dealership means: "we are going to lie to your face to sell a car, and there is nothing you can do about it".

FYI: I have been a loyal VW customer for over a decade and they still didn't think twice about screwing me over.

*I have already reported them to the Better Business Bureau, VW North America, and will continue getting this message out to anyone considering buying at this dealership.<//review>

<Text>I was first impressed with the speed and courtesy of scheduling an appointment.  I am a current VW owner and believe in the brand.  When I saw the reviews I was excited to come to the dealership.  I was looking for a CPO VW. Test drove a great golf. Then said I have a trade in that was in an accident.  I asked should I sell it and come back or would they look for a trade in.  The sales person's tone changed with me when I asked.  She did look for someone that I could talk to.  I was told to that I should plan to work something out with them.  So I sent them info.  2 days later I still haven't heard anything back.  I get it that they may not want it.  So tell me and encourage me to still come back when I am ready to buy.  The communication was poor once it must have looked a little complicated.
I am in sales, I have read Joe Girard's book on selling.  The opportunity was missed with me.  I've selling my current car and will not come here when I am ready to buy.  In sales you say thanks stay in touch and lets try and work together in the future.  For all the great feedback on these reviews I was really surprised.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Professional theives. Don't buy their extended warranty, they don't honor it. Purchased a car through them less then 11 months ago and the battery failed. Incompetent service writer fails to tell their customers when something is not covered under warranty from the get go. Secondly it does not take more than 90 minutes to replace a simple car battery which I could have done myself if I knew these idiots were going to rob me.</review>< Pics>

<date>1543898314316</date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>My visit to Santa Monica Volkswagen was very pleasant. I don"t normally go to dealerships because the minute you step on the lot, the salesmen are all over you. They are over aggressive. Basically they chase you off the lot.
My salesman "Mark Shapiro" wasn't that way. He introduced him self and offered to help me find anything or answer any questions. He opened cars for me and answered my questions without pressing the sale. He also helped by pointing out extra features on the car. Mark was always positive with his attitude towards me and the product. Because of Marks assistance and follow up, I made the purchase I was looking at.
Mark of EXCELLENT for Mr Shapiro.
Thanks Mark for all your help.<//text>< pictures>

Recently went on several test drives here and at a few other dealerships in the area, this was by far our best experience. We worked with Lynn Williams who was knowledgable and really listened to our needs. We went on a couple of test drives where we took the car on the highway which other dealerships did not let us do.

We ultimately went with another car model, but will definitely go here for our next car and work with Lynn. Lots were well organized, lots of cars available in various trims, Lynn knew the nuances between trims and models really well which was helpful.<//Text>

< Review>
Oh my god I don't know if I have enough space to tell you how awesome it is buying a VW here, but let me try.

I had emailed Jett about leasing an e-Golf several years ago, but after doing some more research on charging time and the limited range, I decided to wait. Well, it was time with the 2017 SE having 125 miles in range now, and coming standard with a faster onboard charger.

I emailed Jett back and told her I was ready now, but this time for two e-Golfs. She got back to me very quickly with numbers on two, and I was shocked. I had gotten some numbers from other dealers in Southern California and no one could come close to Santa Monica's numbers, or their inventory. Jett was able to get any color I wanted, with any options.

The other amazing thing about Jett, and Santa Monica VW is that I was never once pressured to come in. Jett was more than happy to deal over email, and she never called me unless she asked, or if I asked her to. And I never got any calls from her sales manager, unlike other dealers in the area.

When I had finally finished my research and I realized that the deal they were offering was too good to pass up, Jett was kind enough to come in early on a Saturday so that my mom and I could get out of their on time to get back to work. She even stuck around all day for me to come back and get the second car. She was beyond awesome.

And the finance manager who handled both mine and my mom's deal was the best I have ever seen. He NEVER pressured us into any of the extras. He did his due diligence and went over all of the options, and answered any and all questions we had. And when doing the second car he didn't even try and sell the options again, he respected us both and did not try and do a hard sell. I was, and am, beyond thrilled.

Thank you so much Jett, and the rest of the great staff at Santa Monica VW, my mom and I love our new e-Golf's, and we honestly can't wait to come back and make more incredible deals!< /Review>

This may be my best experience with a repair shop. Eric assisted me and not only taught me about my car but described in detail what was going on with my car and what was and wasn't essential.

Add in the fact that they continued to follow up and make sure the car was ok is something I had not experienced before and it is MUVH appreciated. I will definitely be coming back for anything my VDub needs 😃</review>

<Text>We brought our car in for the 30k tune up and Matt Bell was phenomenal from start to finish. Midway through the service they found an oil leak. He did a great job of keeping me informed on cost and time. I was never concerned. All together it was an exceptional experience and we thank Matt for taking care of us. He should be recognized for his great work and customer service - it’s rare in Los Angeles.<//Text>< pictures>

Many dealerships, if not all are known for being very aggressive when trying to search for a good car. For my experience, they were friendly and not aggressive from the start, to the end. Staff was knowledgeable and pleasant to work with, without feeling pressured throughout the process. I walked with a great car, and would likely go back again when the time is right.< /Text>

I will always return to VW Santa Monica for service. They have always gone above and beyond, clearly explaining everything with no hidden agenda or charges. Excellent customer service as well. My latest maintenance repair was rather unexpected, and they couldn't have been more accommodating. When I am ready to purchase again, I would not hesitate to come here as well.< /Text>

Willie Rockett is an EXCEPTIONAL service representative! He was so friendly, helpful and got me in and out of there during car check-in, which is always a daunting and time consuming task. He followed up at multiple points throughout the day to let me know where my car was at and was very flexible with my need to come and get it at the end of the day. I can only hope all of my service trips are with Willie as he makes it a breeze!< /Text>

From CT I shopped around for a car for my daughter who lives in LA. I was lucky to have spoken to Inez when I called VW of Santa Monica. I can not say enough good things about her customer service and her understanding of my need to get my daughter in the right car. She was patient with me and worked tirelessly to make the deal work. When my daughter arrived they made her feel comfortable and put her in a car she loves. Thank you for having the patience, for the professionalism and curiosity. I highly recommend them.

Odell Hadley has helped me twice already when it comes to servicing my car and he is honestly the nicest and most efficient person at Volkswagen... He makes the experience seamless and I really appreciated the quick turnaround as well as the updates he provided me with. Other times, I did not receive those updates but with Odell, I did. If you go to Volkswagen, I recommend Odell!<//review>

<text>I worked with Bridgette Richard in purchasing my new vehicle.

Nevertheless, when I closed my deal with Bridgette I was honestly very happy and when I got home, so was my wife.  I can't wait to express my appreciation with my first new client referral.

I've never met anyone who's had an enjoyable experience walking into a car dealership and leasing a car. But I just did. And it was because of Eric Miller and his phenomenal team at Santa Monica VW.< /review>

My service consultant, Odell Hadley, was wonderful and made sure I got to work on time after dropping off my car in the morning. I was able to pick my car up at lunchtime and know it will be a smooth visit when I take it in again to get the new part installed. Thanks Odell!< /Review>

My daughter is a college student in Los Angeles (I am in San Jose) and drives a Beetle.  She had a flat tire, on a Friday late in the afternoon of course, and the others were worn enough to warrant replacement.  I did not feel comfortable sending her to just any tire shop as I am unfamiliar with the area, so made an appointment to bring the car to Volkswagen of Santa Monica after speaking with Tim, who made room for us on Saturday morning in spite of a fully booked schedule.

Saturday morning, I received a call from Odell Hadley.  My daughter was dropping off the car and he wanted to be clear about what tires we wanted after speaking with her and sensing some uncertainty.  He conducted himself in a professional manner, providing me with all of the options, prices and warranty information.  More surprising was that Odell spoke to me as one father to another, giving me assurance that I need not be concerned that our 20 year old daughter, who knows nothing about cars, would be pressured into making uninformed decisions.  It was as if I had a relative there on staff making sure that everything was being done as it should be, and was a warm and generous gesture on his part.  I was even given the option of having the invoice emailed to me so that I could review and pay it online.

On top of the excellent service, the prices were very competitive.  My wife and I could not be more pleased.

Highly recommended.

I had an amazing experience at VW Santa Monica service center. Odell Hadley really took care of me!! When I brought in the used beetle  that I had just purchased  from another dealership for a full inspection and key programming he went through all the problems in detail and convinced me to go back to the original dealership and demand they fix most of the issues and even called them for me, which was successful!!! I highly recommend asking for him when you arrive to have your car serviced.< /review>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>I want to take this opportunity to thank Bridget Stennis for her commitment, dedication and especially her perseverance in letting me know that I was going to be taken care of. Two days prior to coming in, I had been in a near-fatal car accident and almost lost my life. I wasn't mentally or financially prepared to purchase a vehicle. But Bridget assured me I would get the best deal for what I could afford. And boy, did she. WOW! She made it happen. Assisting her was Trish McCall, and let me just say this, I'm a grown-ass man but when faced with your own mortality, it humbles you in ways you may never know until happens to you... So, grown-ass me, walking into the dealership feeling uninformed, unprepared, and apprehensive about going up against a salesperson was scary. Trish instantly made me feel at ease and was an angel, exceptional in talking me off the ledge. Being with her was like popping a XANAX. (prescribed naturally) I felt calm and fortified enough that I would make the right car buying decision.
I would like to acknowledge Volkswagen Santa Monica for your outstanding dedication to customer care....It is nice to know that Volkswagen Santa Monica, with its dedication to their customers, is there to stand by their unquestionable devotion to quality and professional service. I want to thank Bridget and Trish again for being so amazingly helpful in finding the right car for me.  It's perfect, and I'm  "ridin'" in style.<//Review>< Pics>

Overall, our experience with Volkswagen Santa Monica staff is always positive! Matt in The service department was really helpful by guiding us through the whole process for our car recently. We have no complaints about how our Volkswagen Golf has been performing over the past 6 months since we bought it and anytime we have any questions they always treat us like a family. We really appreciate that!
I would absolutely recommend buying your car at Volkswagen Santa Monica!!</text>

Odell Hadley was my service representative. He was energetic, personable and knowledgable. From the moment I walked in I felt I was in the best hands. Even though I was missing some paperwork Odell did not make me feel like I caused him any hassle. He was quick to figure out a workaround. I did not know if my repairs were going to be covered under warranty. After listening to my explanation, Odell assured me that he would do his best to get them covered AND HE DELIVERED!.

Odell was conscientious and followed up later that same day to provide me with a status update. Even though the dealer needed to keep my car overnight and didn't have a loaner for me  to drive, I didn't mind b/c I knew Odell was on the case.

When my car was ready Odell called twice before reaching me to provide me with an update - my car was ready. "Oh by the way - I am in Miami for a business trip, " I said.

"Don't worry, your car will be ready when you return."

And, it was.</review>

I went in cause my engine was running hot. I took it in and explained the whole problem. The tech milked over $3k of my warranty without fixing the problem. The problem got much worse. The advisor hasn’t been returning my calls. I took it to a better shop, I saw them check the head gaskets and they were corroded. You’d think the dealer could’ve figured that out. I’ve been in the car business many years. Shops don’t try that scamming nonsense with me cause I know about cars. This one got me.</review>

Took the car in for service 4400 miles and 18 months later than its regular service, but the team at VW Santa Monica handled it all quick and easy, no fuss, no muss.  Odell Hadley handled things like a pro, and we had a fun chat about the Warriors' line-up to boot.  Everything was handled within the day, easy and quick.</Text>

I walked right in for a service with no appointment and Carlos Fuentes did a great job ensuring my needs were met for my 10k service. 10 / 10 would definitely get my vehicle serviced here again. cheers< /text>

It was said they had to "research the issue" My instincts were correct in that I will never come back to this dealer or even buy a VW again. My advice to everyone is to get a Tesla. Going electric won't solve VW's company problems, it has to do with their values, which is why the whole diesel lawsuit happened.<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>Last Monday I had my car serviced and the experience was excellent.  Peyman Karen does a super job.  In fact when he was not working the previous Friday I simply did not feel comfortable leaving my car with anyone else.  I might also say that no one seemed interested in helping me and as far as I could see there was no one else waiting.  Hope this helps.< /Text>< Response>

I had such a great experience at the Santa Monica Volkswagen. The whole process was so seamless and easy - it was almost shocking! I had a smile on my face the whole time. The whole time is so kind and conscientious. Tyson was super knowledgable about all of the vehicles and made helped me to find exactly the car that fit my needs. Chandler in finance is amazing! She is so understanding and worked with me to find a payment plan that fit my budget and still be able to drive off with the car that fit all of my needs. Seriously so appreciative of this dealership. I've had really bad experiences with other sales teams at other dealerships and it's made me not look forward to the car shopping, new lease process, but Volkswagen, Tyson, and the amazing Chandler and her finance team shattered all of those expectations and really, truly overcame that bias those other dealerships had instilled in me. Great team, great cars, one very happy customer :) :) :)< /Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>I had a fantastic experience at Volkswagen Santa Monica. It was time for my annual service, so I booked a reservation via their online platform (which was very easy and convenient). When I arrived I was greeted by the devilishly handsome Odell Hadley. He was incredibly helpful and attentive. He answered all of my questions thoroughly and had me out the door within minutes. My car was done within a couple of hours, and when I returned to pick it up, Odell was there to greet me and again couldn't be a more exemplary customer service provider. I hope to visit Volkswagen Santa Monica again for the next annual service on my Jetta, and I hope Odell is still around to ensure such a quality experience.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I had a great experience with Carlos, at Santa Monica VW. I walked in for an Oil Change,  with some other minor issues involved. He handled me with care, patience and a great energy. I was very pleased with his quality of customer service-- as well as a great service provided by the Service Department, they were done in such a timely manner. I have had past experiences elsewhere that have been quite the headache, this experience was not like that at all. Thank you Carlos!</review>

I've been in the automobile business for more than 35 years and I can spot a quality service representative when I see one. Emerson Molina fits the bill perfectly. He's knowledgeable about the Volkswagen product, practical in his approach, thorough and wastes no time handling all issues brought to his attention swiftly and professionally. No reason to see anyone else other than he. My last service appointment with Emerson was handled perfectly. Thanks...<//text>

Bridget Stennis is amazing! She made the entire process easy and smooth and took such good care of me. I highly recommend her to anyone getting their car at Santa Monica VW.  Bridget went out of her way to ensure I got the car I wanted at a price I was comfortable with and even came in on her day off to make it happen. She had me in and out in an hour! She is the absolute best and a true professional!<//text>

Amazing experience from the second I pulled into the driveway. I was greeted by many smiling faces and was directed to Luke Young. Luke was incredibly thorough, respectful, professional and prompt. He made sure I was taken care of from the get-go, which is always appreciated! Luke is definitely a valuable asset to VW of SM, an individual I highly recommend without any reservation. Wonderful, friendly service all around. Thank you!< /Text>

< Review>
Nice enough people, but I'm typing this from the line at the DMV after my registration on the car I purchased from them was suspended because they never filed my proof of insurance.

After DMV and AAA told me this I went to the dealership and Deborah gave me a big spin about how this was because of electronic feeds between the insurance companies and DMV and when that feed turns off it causes problems / how this isn’t their fault (it was very well rehearsed, I appreciate it, but the problem is that the DMV never received anything in the registration of the car so there was no feed to turn on)

Worth noting as well that nearly three months later they still haven't filed transfer of ownership paperwork with the DMV, they have excuses for that one too. It’s the DMV’s fault - not theirs.

Wholly untrustworthy folks, try a different VW dealer.< /Review>

Had to get a new tire and when I arrived for service it was not in stock. Luke Young helped me out and ordered it Saturday right before close and it was ready Monday afternoon! The entire process was extremely smooth and done in a timely manner. He gave me his card and told me to give him a call as soon as I heard from Parts. I was in and out in under 1hr. I felt very taken care of and appreciated having a go-to person. Unmatched service!< /review>

He was full of useful information, helped us through test-drives, knowledgeable, and (importantly) NOT PUSHY.  We ended up leasing a beautiful new Jetta.

Kind, considerate, well-spoken and fun, Marvin did an incredible and thorough job of answering all of our questions and addressing our concerns throughout the leasing process.  Unlike any other salesman we'd dealt with at any dealership during our month-long search, Marvin truly seemed to be on our side.

We'll definitely be returning to Marvin and the rest of his team for our future Volkswagen needs.< /Review><Time>1535409636756<//Time><rate>5</rate><pictures>None< /pictures><GmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45<//GmapID><Response>{'time': 1535556680159, 'text': "Hi Jordan,\nWe are thrilled that Marvin could help you put an end to your vehicle search and assist you in taking home a great new Jetta!

It was the perfect buying experience, VW Santa Monica is staffed by honest, rational sales staff, and a very helpful finance dept.  Trish was great.  We will gladly work with them again.<//review>

Chris Weller is the best! I went there this past Sat to look at cars with my friend. I didn't know what I wanted. He showed us around while I tried to make up my mind. He explained each car in detail, very knowledgeable and certainly not pushy. I went there to just LOOK but ended up leaving with the lovely 2013 Beetle. It's absolutely gorgeous. I can't say enough good things about it. All my co-workers have been admiring it. I would recommend Chris to show you around next time you are looking to buy from VW. He is great- very professional. You will leave with a car that suits you as he listens to your needs. A big thanks and much appreciation, Linda<//Text>

Roy is an excellent adviser! I came for an engineer oil change. He tracked the history of my car and explained to me what extra I need to maintenance of my car. Experience of communication with him was pleasant and efficient too. The car runs smoother after the maintenance.
Working with him is a pleasure. His knowledge of automobiles is excellent. His communication skills are also excellent. I highly recommend him as an adviser when someone has a car problem.</text>

<text>I've always had great experiences at Volkswagen Santa Monica. The service is always fast and pleasant and of excellent quality.  I've had a lot covered under my warranty so almost always my visits are free of charge, which is so nice.

At my last visit, I was helped by Sam Momeny who is as kind, positive, efficient, knowledgeable and helpful as anyone could be.  It was such a pleasure meeting him and he helped me so much with getting my car serviced. I was so appreciative and he is a wonderful representative for the company.  Thanks so much, Sam!!!< /text>< Resp>

Bridget Stennis was a pleasure to work with.  This was the most painless and professional car-buying experience I have ever had.  She came through with everything she promised and, perhaps more importantly, never crossed the line between helpful and harassing! I cannot say enough about her service and professionalism.< /review>

I didn't think it was possible to actually SAVE money when my car is in need of service but thanks to the guidance and knowledge of Luke Young, it IS possible. While most overlooked a potential savings opportunity, he knew where to look regarding CA warranties, etc. (when my car was past its purchased warranty) and helped me save big time.

He's extremely knowledgeable about cars in general and can explain a car's operational needs including the purpose of the parts and their importance with ease. Ask for him!

Also, the front desk/cashier girls are wonderful.< /Text>

I had a great experience with Rodrigo Aqueveque at Volkswagen Santa Monica!  He was friendly, professional, and honest.  The 30k service performed on my car was finished in a timely matter.  The shuttle driver also kindly dropped me where I needed to be while the car was serviced, and Volkswagen provided an Uber for me to return to the dealership when the car was ready.  Because of city regulations, they couldn't provide a complimentary car wash, but instead, they vacuumed and cleaned my windows which made me very happy :) My car has only been serviced at Volkswagen dealerships and I am very happy to have access to such a good one!  P.S. I once drove by to get bolts for my license plate, and they were also friendly that time and quick/willing to help.</Text>

This was my last scheduled service ice before turning in my car t the end of the current lease.  He explained all the work being done thoroughly, and spoke to me at length about Volkswagen models and service considerations for my next lease.  He did more to help me zero in on the next VW I want more than any sales person has!  He is super professional and polite, and got me in and out quickly.

<Review>Horrendous service department.

My car had a failure of the timing chain tensioner, which is under warranty through the outcome of litigation due to this part failing.  Because of that failure my car had engine damage and would not run.  I waited for 3 weeks to get this issue resolved and the work to be covered under the warranty but in the end I was told that the work would not be covered. I was quoted a price of over $6000 to fix my car, which is completely astronomical given that the issues all stemmed from a part failure that I had nothing to do with.

On top of this the service manager reported incorrectly to VW that I had driven the car prior to bringing it to the dealership, when in reality I had it towed there from an independent shop who had initially diagnosed the problems. I told them this multiple times, and finally had to go to the dealership and ask how in the world I could have driven the car after a failed tensioner caused damage to one of the cylinders. I was told "That's what you get for not bringing your car to the dealership first". Unbelievable, I've lost faith in both VW and Santa Monica VW. I will never purchase a VW again.

To add insult to injury, they also charged me 1k for just doing a teardown to try and diagnose the damage themselves.<//Review><Name>Fabian Elmers<//Name>< rating>

He was friendly and so helpful, sorted everything out with my warranty company and even helped me handle the rental car through the on-site Enterprise office. Genuinely one of the best customer service experiences I've ever had, very impressed, highly recommend!!!

Update: took my car in again for regular service and was helped by Carlos Fuentes, who was great! The service dept at VW Santa Monica continues to impress.<//Text>< Time>

<username>Aaron McMullin</username><Review>Luke Young was the service technician who has helped me out the last two times I was there. He is definitely a professional and, while still quite young, has mastered the art of courtesy and professionalism. It is because of his attention to detail and his ability to go above and beyond the call of duty that I will be returning to Volkswagen of Santa Monica.</Review>< Rate>

<text>I had a great experience leasing a 2019 e-golf from Volkswagen Santa Monica. Over the past month I had visited and spoke with many dealerships (multiple car brands) and most left me with that "no" feeling. From my first visit at VW SM to check out two models, to signing the lease a week later, the whole process, working with Andrew Morais, was pleasant and pressure-free. This also carried over when signing papers with Chandler in finance, as she explained things clearly and answered all my questions. I will definitely be back when my lease is up.</text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Whether it is the high turnover of employees or their inability to follow through on their word, Volkswagen Santa Monica has shown multiple times they do not care about their customers.

Initially things seemed great with my car, the sales person (who is now no longer with the company) lied about the status of the tires, ensuring the vehicle had a "new set of rubber". When bringing my vehicle to a mechanic for a thorough inspection, he noticed a few areas of concern, including the front tires. I then called the dealership to discuss this and a few other questions I had about my warranty, and was informed a second employee that I worked with is "no longer there".

I brought these concerns to the attention of the used car manager, Gary, who agreed to replace the front two tires as a courtesy, I just needed to let him know the tires I was looking to replace them with. When I informed them of the tires I was looking at (roughly $170 per replacement) I was scoffed at and was told that is an absurd price and they would never agree to it.

I then got in contact with the General Manager of Volkswagen Santa Monica, Tammy, to talk about the issue at hand, and I was told to bring the car in so they could take a look and get everything straightened out. I brought the vehicle in and the front tires were noted as "consider replacing" due to their tread depth from their mechanics, yet the GM Tammy rejected covering the tires because they "were not failing". After 2 months of back and forth and unreturned voicemails, I was on my own to replace my tires, but I could get them "at cost" to the dealership... the cost of those tires if I decided to go with them? $174 per tire, plus install.

In short- I hope LA Car Guys dealers across Santa Monica see the type of shady service Volkswagen Santa Monica is participating in and remedies it, fast. Lying to a customer, to then authorize a replacement, only to THEN rejecting that authorization when the tires were documented as "consider replacing" from their own shop is a slap in the face and an abuse of power and trust. I cannot stress enough the headache you will encounter dealing with this car dealership, no matter what the sticker price says get ready to be shafted and abandoned the second you leave the lot.

There are plenty of other dealerships out there that WILL appreciate you, your time, and your business, it's a shame Volkswagen Santa Monica is not one of them<//review><username>John B</username>< Resp>

The Santa Monica Volkswagen Service Department is absolutely over-the-top! I have been a customer for 10 years and always have a positive experience. Emerson Molina is so honest, informative and stays in great communication. He always goes above and beyond. Very thankful to have a trustworthy dealership and people to look after me and the best interest of my vehicle.< /Review>

<time>1551392857511</time><Review>I was looking for a used new car low mileage and found a great Jetta.
We were helped by the fabulous Donia Chiarizia who was so friendly and helpful she didn’t feel like the usual car salesperson. she wasn’t pushy she was informed and let us make up our minds I’ve always been put off by hard selling she made our experience amazing, i fell in love with my car she went above and beyond to make sure i was happy with my purchase. Helpful and stayed behind to make sure i got what i wanted.

Car buying is stressful and when your dealing with the typical car salesman it can be even more exhausting and frustrating. So to have Donia’s personality helped me make up my mind.

The only drawback i would say was the finance person we dealt with came across as super aggressive nice guy but he really exhausted us in the end. If your buying a car you know you’ll have to deal with something like this in the end.
But i have my car and a great package to go with it and I’m super happy.
Definitely go to this car showroom you’ll get great friendly help they all seemed like great team mates.< /Review>< GmapID>

They sold me an unworthy maintenance plan "term care select". It was two years ago, and I was a college new grad with little experience. They were good at boasting about the plan. Sold it to me for $1299 dollars. But the actual useful services included in the plan (battery change + brake pad etc.) is worth not more than $600.

When bargaining on the car, I brought experienced friends as careful watch-eye. But when signing the contract, the sales peole took me into a different room, isolated my friends from me so that they could trick me more easily.

A rule of thumb is, never buy anything more than the car itself in a dealer. I was too young and tricked. Lesson learned.</text>

<Review>Wonderful experience at Santa Monica VW Service. Greeted promptly at service drop off area, and Odell Hadley, our service tech, was fantastic. He got us registered and into the shop very quickly. A routine 2 year service, and the car was ready for pick up sooner than we expected. Very professional, and everyone involved was friendly.</Review>< gmapID>

<Review>By far the best experience with a car dealership service department that I've ever had. They made sure I was taken care of while my car was being serviced. I was in and out within an hour and couldn't have been happier. Thank you Rod (service department worker) and Volkswagen for making my experience fast, fun, and enjoyable!

I'm not a fan of my car, I think I got what you would call a "lemon". I take really great care of it, bringing it in the minute a light turns on or service is needed. I've had a lot of "out of warranty" problems that haven't been cheap.</Review>< pics>

<text>Annual service arranged by telephone. Luke Young at Santa Monica Volkswagon organized the work on site and was very professional. There was an unexpected warranty repair that took longer than I was told and I would have organized my time differently if I had known about it beforehand.

The service department, particularly my service agent, Emerson Molina, were friendly, professional and quick!  Emerson walked me through everything they would be doing to my car, and called me with updates throughout the day on the car. He was never pushy or demanding, you could tell he cares about the customer and their needs.

I've been coming back here for all my vehicle needs ever since Emerson Molina helped me with my first car in 2013. He is so dedicated and handles every case with care and efficiency.

<text>I came to Volkswagen Santa Monica after a couple of days that included a flat tire in underground parking, the horrific discovery that my lug nut lock had been lost, and frantically calling around to find anyone who could blow up the tire for me to get to VW. By the time I arrived I was already completely exhausted by the experience, and Odell Hadley greeted me with a calm and soothing voice that I really appreciated. My husband had encouraged me to buy new tires elsewhere for less, but after speaking with Mr. Hadley for a few minutes about my predicament,  I asked him about tires and he found some great tires for me at a reasonable price. I had the car back in a couple of hours, along with two years roadside assistance should I have any future trouble. I highly recommend, definitely ask for Odell and he will take good care of you!<//text><Rate>5<//Rate>< username>

Roy in service is very knowledgeable. When there is an issue with my GTI, he makes sure to thoroughly understand the issue so he can discuss it with his technician and does his best to get things covered under warranty. The warranty doesn't always come through, but the work is always done right and I feel well taken care of.< /text>

<Text>My fiancé purchased a car here in 2017 which she was assured she could sell back to the dealership by the saleswoman (Jet)

When she needed to move countries four months later they would not even bother to assess the car or return any calls or emails.  When she escalated it to the manager (David) via call he didn't bother to phone back either. A final call and email to the General Manager (Sean) got nothing either.

We love this place. We do not know what we enjoy more. Having our car worked on, with the piece of mind that it is being done with certified experts. Or the fact, that we get to come in and talk to Debi Callender. She is warm, easy to talk to and worked with us and our budget. We hope we do not have issues again but should we, we will be marching straight in to see Debi.</Review>

Emerson Molina was the service rep at Volkswagen of Santa Monica who worked with me when I went to deal with an issue I was told was not covered under the warranty by the service folks at Santa Barbara Volkswagen. The experience I had with Emerson renewed my faith in car dealers. He was personable, patient, and helpful in every way. If you're going to go to a dealer for service issues, I would recommend Santa Monica Volkswagen based on my experience there, and I would definitely ask for Emerson! And I got my car washed complimentary...</Text>

Ryan was friendly and eager to go out of his way to help. There was a bit of miscommunication that resulted in one repair not being done the first day, but Ryan was accommodating and allowed me to bring the car back the following morning without scheduling a new appointment. I would recommend Santa Monica VW for service and will return for future service needs.</Text>

Worst customer service experience award goes to their service department!
They have no sense of basic customer service and we have been car-less for over A WEEK, thanks to them (with no sort of compensation). We will be taking our business elsewhere and making sure never to recommend VW, especially this service department, to anyone.</text>

We’ve been relying on service at this dealership for decades. This time Odell Hadley helped us. He was very pleasant and polite, listened carefully to our issues with our car, and discussed a discount coupon we had. He provided an estimate and called later with an updated one, one that was almost $1000 less than the actual bill. The discount coupon wasn’t honored until I spoke with the cashier when I picked the car up. Except for that, the car seems fine and I trust the care and service at SM VW.<//Text>

Ryan at VW of Santa Monica is great and was so helpful when I was in last week.  The shuttle was running late and I needed to get to work, and Ryan swooped right in and took care of it - no more waiting!  Their team did the required work on my car in the time they said it would take to get it done and it was done right the first time.  My car always goes to VW of Santa Monica!< /text>

Came to have my tire replaced after a blowout and had the pleasure of having Thom Painter help me. Thom is very friendly and attentive and gave me a very accurate estimate for the price of replacing my tire. Highly recommend him< /review>

My appointment was at 10:30. Went in for a recall. Was told it would take about 2-2.5 hours. Was told I would get a phone call once it was ready. I called at 1:30, was told to come at 2pm. Went to the cashier at 2:15. Was told the paperwork hadn't been filed by my service adviser Odell. Although he was pleasant, I sat and waited another 45min to get my car. And was told my paperwork would be mailed because the warranty technician wasn't in. Every time I go to VW of Santa Monica I'm disappointed. Unless the service manager, Willy is involved. He is amazing!</Text>

The experience was very satisfactory. I came in for an oil change and Nick was so kind to let me know I need a filter changed. He was able to fix it in less than 10 minutes and got me out of there within the hour he said it would take the service to take. This location is convenient for me and am planning to come back for future services if need be.< /review>

It takes 20 minutes to change out the wiper engine. They wanted a $330 for 20-30 minutes work. That is more then $660 an hour work.... they are plenty of other dealership that would charge $70-$100.

<Text>I just purchased a new VW Golf at Volkswagen Santa Monica.  Buying a car has always been a stressful experience for me in the past. Thanks to Product Specialist Mark Shapiro, that was not true with this purchase!  Mark answered every question I put out with knowledge and honesty.  His knowledge and his ability to share that knowledge was invaluable to me. I met with him numerous time and he always took as much time as I needed to answer questions or to show me various cars.  I never once felt pressured to make a decision and I felt I could trust Mark.  Trust is very important to me. Mark was always professional yet friendly, honest and down to earth and is genuinely a really good guy.   I unconditionally recommend Mark Shapiro to anyone interested in buying a Volkswagen.< /Text>< Resp>

I brought my 1 year old car in for brake issues which should be covered under the 3-year new car warranty. The brake rotors were warped and causing a terrible vibration. I was told within 30 seconds of speaking to a service adviser (Odell), that my car would not be covered. I explained to him that the part is under warranty and should be taken care of without cost. His service advisor overhead the conversation and said they would take a look at it and get back to me.

I got a call the next day stating they would cover the Rotors under 'good-will', but I would have to pay to replace the brake pads. First off, it's not good-will, it's called a Volkswagen Warranty. Secondly, the only reason the brake pads had worn was due to the defective rotors. It's simple cause & effect. One defective part, ruined the other.

I refused the service and instead called Volkswagen of America, who looked into the issue and decided that yes, I was correct, and that both would be covered.

Had I simply listened to VW of Santa Monica, I would have been paying out $500+ on brake rotors and pads, which were both replaced by Volkswagen under warranty.

BE WEARY. These guys are snakes and will take advantage of you at every turn.<//Text>

<text>The service started off a little slow, but I could hear the lady upfront repeatedly ask for service managers to come help the customers waiting. Thom Painter was informative and quick, didn't try to upsell me any additional services which I appreciated. I waited about a little over an hour, which was expected. Everyone at the dealership was nice and friendly as well.< /text><user>116309477267681773523< /user><username>Vy Mai<//username><Response>None< /Response>< Rate>

<Text>Truman De La Cruz was great support in me making my final decision on a car. This was my first experience leasing a car, and generally I am skeptical of car salesmen, but he was friendly, easy going, genuine and I truly appreciated his efforts in giving me the best deal.
Thank you Truman, and we shall be in touch as I still have plenty of questions about the car!</Text>< Rating>

I learned my lesson.  Take my advice.  Buy your car from a dealership that is close to your home and will see you immediately when your engine light comes on.   Also, be aware of the double talk.  I don't believe in coincidences but my engine light came on shortly after getting it repaired from Santa Monica VW.  Of course, I was told that the recent repair work has nothing to do with the engine light coming on now.< /Review>

My whole car service experience was taken care of by Debi Callender a few months ago and I can't fault it.  Debi was friendly, easygoing and extremely helpful.  The car service was completed very quickly and when it was done Debi contacted me directly to let me know.  I am very happy with the whole process and will certainly be coming back.< /Review>

I enjoyed the experience from test driving to making the deal to buy the car.  Francois was very honest with me and not overselling, although he did give me a lot of confidence that it was the right car for me.
Overall, It was the best car buying experience I have had so far.< /review>

I had a really bad experience completely wasting 3 hours which we didn't have to if they didn't contact us with wrong information (and continually give us misleading information).

We were looking for a certain color combination which was only available in the Downtown dealer (according to the website) so we emailed them but the somehow Santa Monica dealer contacted us (later figured out that those emails are sent to multiple nearby locations). They said that they had the color, so we ended up making an appointment. When we got there, the person we contacted wasnt there and we ended up talking to another sales person. More importantly they did NOT carry the color combination. However the salesperson kept saying that the Downtown shouldn't have that color either because he never saw that color. After a while we figured out that Downtown does have the color. Then they suggested cheaper price for the color they had. After hours we were exhausted and we almost made an agreement. We found that they increased the drive off from the original offer, and it wasn't actually cheaper. Then they insisted that the downtown dealer would have the same drive off. But what we found out by calling the Downtown dealer was that they do offer it with the original drive-off. We ended up leaving this dealer and leasing from the Downtown dealer. Completely wasted 3 hours.</text>

<text>I previously took my car to get serviced at a smaller VW dealership, but that was a mistake! Santa Monica VW answers the phone on the first ring (!) and I had the choice of times to make an appointment for a service.

Jeff Crawford is an absolutely top-notch advisor at Santa Monica Volkswagen. Not only did he get me into a loaner car immediately, my car was repaired the same day. My car runs beautifully and it came back clean as a whistle. I love Santa Monica VW and can't recommend it highly enough.</Review>

Emerson Molina

He is always VERY attentive, caring and delivers above average customer service. It makes our visits pleasurable and well worth it, since we live in Burbank.

Emerson deserves a raise!</Review>

I brought my vehicle in for a recall and was taken care of by Odell Hadley. I highly suggest when having your car serviced to be assisted by Odell. He's a standup gentleman and had my car in and out very quickly. Much appreciated. Thanks Odell!< /Review>

This was my first time leasing a car, and although it could have been a very overwhelming experience, the team (especially my Sales Specialist, Cody Lecates) seamlessly guided me through every step and question. Cody sat with me several hours during each visit to the dealership. He was always smiling and eager to get me in the perfect car for my needs.< /Text>

I had a great Experience at Volkswagen Santa Monica.

Roy Halleluyan gave me such great service that I will always want to go to him in the future. Best service I've received so far. I had to get a loaner and he was able to get everything taken care of for me.

10/10 would refer Roy if you need service here.</Text>

<text>We drove up on Saturday evening around 5 pm got out the car and was instantly greeted by Mr. Anton Schuberthan.  I found that to be refreshing since most dealerships one can never find someone to help you.  I had seen a web special earlier that day as was hoping it was still available.  I explained to him all of my details and what I was looking for with money down and payment options.  He was really knowledgeable about the vehicle and took us out for a test drive, which another couple was working out there numbers to purchase 10 minutes earlier.  After we test drove the vehicle I knew this was the one for me, so I wanted to see if I could persuade my deal against the other couples deal...He told us anything is possible so we got inside and did all the paperwork.

Anton is lightning fast and submits the offer to his manager, suddenly the couple stands up and decides to pass on the vehicle...I knew it was mine ;)  From there everything went super smooth and Anton made sure all features were covered right up till closing time!  What I like most about him was he was straight forward and also a go getter' and I guarantee he knows about every single detail when it comes to Volkswagen cars!  The other dealerships usually don't know that much about the car even though they sell them...strange.  No hassle, great service, great time with the whole Santa Monica dealership, no arrogant attitudes and everyone is very friendly!  Thank you Anton for making the car buying experience fun and not stressful!</text>< Pictures>

I had the pleasure of working with Odell Hadley most recently at VW Santa Monica. Bringing in my car to get serviced is never a fun activity but this was by far the best experience I had at VW Santa Monica. Odell was patient, thorough, incredibly friendly and put me at ease. For previous  times I have brought in my car I work with whomever is the first available but after working with Odell I will be requesting him specifically in the future.</text>

I had fantastic service at VW Santa Monica. Roy went over everything that was going to happen so there was no surprises. He even when above and beyond and offered car service to beach while I waited for my car to be finished. He not only took care of my car, but he also took care of me! Very happy with the service!</review>

I recently had an incredible experience after determining that I had a nail in the tire of my 2013 Jetta. Not only did the SM Volkswagen determine the problem within five minutes of my arrival to the service area but associate Damien and tech Dorian worked to patch the tire and process my payment within 30 minutes, total. It was incredible service despite a busy day. One of the many many reasons this is my second lease with SM Volkswagen.</review>

We had some malfunction with the clutch in our VW Beetle while on a road trip, Emerson Molina and the guys at the service center stayed late to meet us after a tow and took extra care to put us back on the road. When the diagnosis turned out to be a quick fix we weren't even charged the diagnostic fee. Really hard working and generous employees. Highly Recommended.< /review>

Great experience with a new service representative, Michael Gunter, and the service manager (Willie).   They communicated with me every step of the way and did what it took to get everything finished in a timely manner.

The check in/drop off process took a bit longer than I hoped, but it was a Monday morning.  The latte was tasty and the shuttle guy was really nice too!< /review>

<Text>Mark Shapiro went from being a car salesperson, to our friend. He helped us make the most informed and smart decision when it came to choosing and buying a new car. He worked together with the managers and loan agencies to get us the best deal possible. I never felt pressured to make a rash decision, and had plenty of time to make a great decision on my own. Loved my experience at VW Santa Monica!</Text>< user_name>

I took my Passat in for a recall and routine service and everything was handled beautifully.  I was given a realistic timeline for when my car would be done and I received a personal phone call once my car was ready to be picked up.  I will definitely return for any future servicing needs! Michael Gunter was my servicing agent and I highly recommend him for his personable service.</Text>

Thom Painter is fantastic. He is courteous, knowledgable and efficient. He made my service experience pleasant from the moment he met me at my car. This is the second time he's helped me and I remember thinking he was awesome the first time too. VW Santa Monica is fortunate to have him. I put his name in my phone and will be requesting him for future services.<//review>

This was the best car buying experience I've had. Chris Simpson is a stellar salesman. I never felt pressured or that I was being "taken for a ride." The rest of the staff was great too. I felt like I was being well taken care of at all times, and that they knew my time was valuable.

Thanks VW Santa Monica!<//review>

<text>My girlfriend and I were on a mission to lease our fist car and thankfully we met Donia Chiarizia at Volkswagen Santa Monica. She was actually the first agent we met in the day, and little did we know she would also be the last. Unlike a lot of agents who were persistent and pushy to the point of making us uncomfortable, Donia was patient and courteous and listened to our needs. She was able to get us a great deal, and we are incredibly happy to have walked away with the car we wanted.< /text><Resp>None<//Resp><rating>5<//rating></record>

It was my first time leasing a vehicle on my own, which was very daunting at first, but with the help of Anton Schuberthan, I had the best possible experience! Anton was wonderful to work with- super helpful, very thorough, friendly, and professional. I am so happy with my experience/purchase, and excited to have left the lot in the exact car I was hoping for. 100% satisfaction! Thank you Anton!</Text>

<text>Very pleased with the service here.  I am a busy guy and have limited time to deal with anything besides my work.  Luke went above and beyond to resolve my problems cheaply and efficiently.  In fact, Luke saved me over $200, had my car ready in less than an hour, and did it all with a positive "can-do" attitude that I really appreciated.

I will absolutely be coming back to VW Santa Monica and I'll be asking for Luke as a service adviser.</text><Rating>5< /Rating><user_id>115773489366282943421</user_id></record>

Great 60k mile service at VW Santa Monica. Jeff Crawford, my service guy, was awesome as usual, personally tending to the car during the day and explaining the process by staying in touch till it was ready. Love keeping a car for more years and look forward to this level of attention in future.</Review>

I dropped my car off for an oil change and annual check. Luke Young, my service agent, explained the car service process and how long it was going to take (about 2 hours).

The serve was completed within a hour and my car was vacuumed!

Thanks Luke for your professionalism and customer service and VWSM for a speedy repair!</Review>

Had an appointment scheduled service member Odel after waiting an hour said no one looked at my car and doesn’t know when they would even have time because they are too busy. Talk about inconsiderate staff. Would never come back to this place.<//text>

<Review>So I bought my second car from SM Volkswagen. My sales rep's name is Omid, and I am pretty baffled at how trash the customer service is. I am not sure if this guy isn't getting the right training from upper management or if he just genuinely doesn't care about customer service. Long story short, I gave Omid everything he need to know to give me a great customer service experience. Nothing out of the ordinary. Really all I was asking was that he save me time by being prepared for when I came into the dealership. Though everytime I showed up he failed to prepare. I asked that he have the car ready for a test drive. Nope. I asked that when I asked that when I arrive to purchase the car the paperwork be ready. Nope. Lastly, He sold me a car with a broken sunroof, which he promised VW would fix. However when I tried to coordinate VW fixing it, he would just respond with super vague information essentially trying to make me project manage the window tinting myself. Am I crazy? Or should your sales rep be actively trying to make your life and experience with a business easier. Instead it was like pulling teeth trying to get answers from this dude.<//Review>< resp>

Great service, very professional sale people, especially Shawn.
Flexible on prices, friendly attitude. I appreciate their service as much as they
appreciate mine. Would like to return again for another car if possible.

Big shout out to Sean Mollabagher, thanks for your help and your good reasoning.

I will see you soon. :)< /review>

Should have gone to your service center much sooner. Debi Callender was super courteous, laid back, and helpful... and fun! And everything was under warranty and she didn't try to sell me anything I didn't need. 5 stars!</text>

< Review>
My service rep. was Debi Callendar and she was extremely helpful through the entire process of my one year service. She was very understanding of the problems I identified in the vehicle and made sure all of the points were addressed. In addition, she called to alert me of a tear that was noticed while the service person was working under my vehicle. By managing my expectations and needs for a vehicle, she was able to arrange a loaner car until my vehicle could be completely fixed.< /Review>

I went to get my car serviced at Santa Monica Volkswagen. Emerson Molina helped me out. He did a great job of communicating what the issue was with my car and also was prompt about calling and letting me know when my car would be ready. It was a very easy, simple experience with great customer service.</Review>

Took my car in on Wednesday at 7am as my check engine light was on for a couple of days. Roy helped me immediately and was very efficient. Unfortunately, the part needed was unavailable- but made sure to get me a loaner car by the end of the day. The car was ready after work the following day.
Really happy with the service and speediness of VW Santa Monica.</Review>

<Text>This place is awesome! My car broke down late at night, and I had it towed to their drop off place. The next day, Roy called me up and gave me the run down, and was able to fix my car the next day. One of the best customer service I've seen in a long time! I highly recommend anyone to go to VW Santa Monica, and ask for Roy!< /Text>< Name>

Shopped around at other dealerships and these guys gave me the best deal, hands down. Worked with Bridget Stennis on my lease, she beat everyone's price and most importantly, got it done fast! Chandler helped me with all the paperwork and was so sweet and worked out some good numbers for me. Central location, very warm treatment from everyone I came into contact with there. And I LOVE my car! I felt like I was in good hands the entire time. Highly recommend!!!< /Text>

If you are looking for a car and a great honest, knowledgeable caring sales person go see Moe Aboushaban at Santa Monica Volkswagen. He has helped us get three cars and always is attentive to all our growing family needs. Style and safety is what brought us to the Volkswagen brand but Moe's excellence in finding the car to meet our familys needs is what keeps us coming back.</Text>

<Text>I spent 3 months traveling late last year, and came home and immediately needed a car. I took an uber from LAX directly to this dealership, arrived late and exhausted from a 10 hour flight. I was really dragging my feet at the thought of dealing with a pushy sales person, but Mark Shapiro was everything I could’ve asked for. He was incredibly thoughtful, warm, and considerate. Very upfront and honest, to the point, and refreshingly enjoyable to be around. He helped me pick, test drive, and take home a beautiful 2017 Jetta! He was so knowledgeable with tons of industry experience. If you’re looking to buy ANY car, but especially a VW, I would only recommend contacting Mark. He made this the most simple and pleasant car purchase in the history of car purchases! Thank you, Mark!!<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Volkswagen Santa Monica is as friendly and organized as they could possibly be. They give you a time to check in that is coordinated with the shuttle that will take you to work and they keep updating you during the day what their findings are and give you options of what you want to have repaired.

This time, I worked with Luke Young and he did not only have my car checked for its yearly check-up, he had it done while I waited for my shuttle and even managed to reduce the standard fee because of an expired coupon I brought in. So nice! I wish everything was that easy and pleasant.< /Text><resp>None< /resp><rating>5< /rating>< user_id>

Excellent experience at VW Santa Monica.  Took my car in Saturday morning and had it back by 3pm, with a serpentine and v belt replacement and also a brake booster vacuum pump replacement.  They also discounted 1 hour of labor out of the total, which was nice.  My service associate, Jeff Crawford, was very helpful and responsive.</Review>

I just got into my second lease with Volkswagen Santa Monica. Bridgette Richard helped me both times and she's wonderful! She's extremely helpful, professional and not pushy, which is key for me as I used to dread the car-buying experience. I love the car and the high quality service that I get from Bridgette and the team at VW Santa Monica.< /review>

Went in for my 30K service and to have a check engine light diagnosed.  Odell Hadley was my service advisor and did a fantastic job!  He was courteous and friendly and he set the expectations up front for the time needed to complete the service and the cost to ensure that there wouldn't be any surprises.  He made sure my transportation needs were met in the interim and communicated with me frequently throughout the process with updates and upon completion.  I received my vehicle back in a timely manner and it runs and looks just as great as the day I bought it.  I won't have it serviced anywhere else.  Great job VW Santa Monica Team!<//Review>

<text>I consistently call Jeff Crawford when a warning light goes on or it's time for a scheduled service for my 2012 Touareg. He listens and advises with patience and is very thorough. He also has a great sense of humor which works for me because when I come in I am usually tense and concerned about the time away from doing my job.

So thanks Jeff Crawford for consistently making unexpected situations easy to handle.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45<//gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

...As much as you can 'love it' when your car breaks down...
Roy Halleluyan made my last two visits to the Santa Monica dealership as pain free as they could possibly be.
He knows what he's talking about, he is clear and patient with his explanations and I would highly recommend searching him out to be your contact if you have to go there. Thanks Roy... you rule.<//Review>

< Review>
I had several intermittent problems with my VW Rabbit that were a major nuisance. The most troubling was that the hatchback door would not open about 1/2 the time. I brought the car in twice and both times was told because they couldn't "duplicate the problem" that they couldn't fix it.

Well when I had an issue with the A/C not blowing cold, I went back and fortunately got Luke Young as my service adviser. I figured that I would yet again bring up the problem I was having with the rear door (and power windows, radio, and randomly illuminating dashboard lights). He wrote everything down and called me one hour after I left. He said I needed a new A/C compressor which they were going to replace (under warranty). He called about an hour later to tell me that I MIGHT have a bad "Comfort Module" and that they were going to replace that as well (also under warranty). Now mind you, this was done WITHOUT them being able to duplicate any of the problems, the excuse I had received twice before. Luke's attitude was that he was going to do whatever he needed to the make sure I left happy. Well it worked. When I picked the car up, everything was resolved. And even though it was 55 degrees outside, I cranked up the new A/C and froze my A$$ off as I drove away, thrilled that I was no longer dealing with issues that I thought I was going to have to live with for the life of the car. Way to go!<//Review>

<Text>Had to take my car last minute because the engine light came on. This is the first time I've come to the Santa Monica location and I gotta say it was great. Roy Halleluyan was very helpful from the beginning and he made sure my car was good to go by the end of the day :D.I haven't had any problems with my car but I will definitely go back to this location when I need to have my car checked or any other services my ca might need.<//Text><rate>5< /rate></record></dataset><record>

Odell Hadley was super helpful when I took my car in to have the airbag replaced. He went above and beyond to make sure I had my car back in the promised time frame. Thanks, Odell!<//Review>

I highly recommend Roy Halleluyan. He takes the time to understand what needs to be done to the car. You'll never feel like you are asking a "dumb question." He also follows through with everything he promises to do. He provides exceptional client care.<//Text>

<text>I am a repeat customer at VW Santa Monica because they take better care of me than any other VW dealership I've been to! Marisa helped me purchase the perfect car and the perfect price. She was personable and very accommodating! She gave me extensive information so that I would know all of my options. Both Marisa and Inez made this experience really smooth for me. VW Santa Monica has a customer forever with me! I love my car and I'm so glad I purchased it at VW Santa Monica!< /text><rate>5< /rate>< Time>

I was having issues with my car radio and Jeff Crawford was gladly able to assist me.  After a few hours of leaving my car at the dealership, Jeff contacted me immediately notifying that he would gladly replace the radio with all the same functionality.  Thanks Jeff.< /review>

Roy Halleluyan was very attentive and communicative throughout the process, including providing multiple updates on the status of my car - they turned around my repairs in less than 24 hours, which was great. The free wash and detail was also a nice touch.

I would highly recommend this service shop if you want your work done well.< /Review>

From the valet service at arrival to the detailed car inspection report at the end, everything went seamlessly.  I was very well informed about the service details, costs, and time schedule, all thanks to my service manager, Peyman Kahen.  If you need to service your car, I highly recommend this dealership/service center.<//Review>

Went in for my 1 yr/10k mile service on my '15 GTI and Ed was extremely helpful throughout the process. The only negative was that the shop kept running into problems and I had to come back 2 additional times to get all of my service done. A little annoying, but Ed helped me get my rims replaced (warranty item) and they look great now!<//Review>

<Review>Emerson Molina was an amazing service advisor.  He took the time to explain in detail each repair that I needed and worked hard to get me the best deals/discounts available. Thanks VW of Santa Monica : )<//Review><time>1431638842382<//time><userid>118164485496735843990</userid>< Pictures>

<Text>I’ve had a few frustrating experiences with the Santa Monica VW service center and will not go out of my way to return. There are many things to love about this service center, like the coffee and the complimentary shuttle service, but if you have an inexperienced service rep... good luck. After dropping my car off for routine maintenance (that I pre-paid for when buying the car there) and warrantee repair, my service rep failed to let me know they needed to keep the car overnight. He let me know at the very end of the day after I checked in with him. I ended up having to order an Uber to LAX as it was the only Enterprise open after hours to pickup a rental car. When I went to pickup my car days later, the service techs had gouged scratches into my steering wheel. They agreed on a discount for later service. During the later service, I had to remind the service rep repeatedly about the discount. He ignored me and didn’t apply it... I had to go to his manager to get it honored. After getting my car back over this second service, the service techs left a grease stain in my roof upholstery and they failed to fix the issue under warranty. It’s unfortunate, they try hard and make it seem like a solid service center, but I’m having better experiences elsewhere.<//Text>< Rating>

Excellent service as always. Jeff always takes care of me and makes sure my VW is running. Gabriel also is always there to make me smile and make sure I am pleased.

Not sure how much longer she will hold up, but thanks for keeping her run.

Thank you

This was the first time I've used VW Santa Monica's service center. I took my Passat there for warranty work. I couldn't be happier with VW Santa Monica's service. I was greeted by Odel Hadley, who is warm, friendly, efficient and honest. He gave me advice on how to handle an engine problem I was having that wouldn't have shown up during diagnostics since the Check Engine light never came on during the incidents. I went there in the morning and had my car back by the time I finished breakfast up the street. I highly recommend this facility and Odel Hadley.< /review>

Overall, I enjoy the Santa Monica Volkswagen team and have bought two cars from this location. On my most recent purchase I worked with Daniel Tat - who was amazing and paid attention to all the necessary details I needed in a new car as I was pregnant with my first child. He was very patient with me and understood that I was in the market to make a purchase on a family car and did not want to be rushed with such an important decision. In the end we found the car with all the right safety features plus bells and whistles and Daniel worked with me and the finance department to meet my budget.</text>

I really appreciated all the time that Luke Young took to walk me through the things that were wrong with my car. He even had the tech lift the car up so he could point out the issues underneath. I have a hard time with dealers generally -- ie. I forget that you can negotiate prices, even for service, which I honestly find a bit uncomfortable -- I wish that they would just give you the best price up front -- like any other store. So this is why I'm giving a lower rating.

Also Thom Painter provided good customer service the last time I visited, but I didn't get a chance to give a review for that visit.</review>

I had a great experience with Roy Halleluyan, especially since I needed my service with very little notice for a pending road trip - it was completed in one day and he was very helpful and walked me through what needed to get done.  The only thing I feel was overlooked was the rear wiper, which at the 50K service was standard in checking out and still needs to be replaced.  I think it was just due to the limited time I gave the dealership to service my car.  Roy did say I could stop by any time and get that fixed.
Other than that (which is VERY minor), awesome experience and I will be back.

Great service. I went in for my 60,000 mile service, my guy was Emerson Molina (he's definitely a rockstar).

He let me know what all needed to be checked out -- of course 60,000 miles could be quite a check up so he let me know what was imperative and help ranked priority of what needed to be done right away to soothe my budget.

Called me and kept me abreast of all the work in real time -- luckily there were no delays and my car was ready same day. This place is definitely my go-to.</text>

Odell Hadley really went the extra mile to make sure my service appointment at Santa Monica VW was exceptional. He was friendly, efficient, kept me updated and organized a loaner car for me when it turned out the service was going to be more than an oil change. His efficiency and professionalism ensures that I will return to VW Santa Monica for all my service needs.< /Text>

Worked with Odell Hadley, super transparent with what was needed and what was done. Went above and beyond my expectations of what Auto Services can do. Will return.</Text>

<Review>Best experience I’ve ever had at a car dealer/ servicer, hands down. Had a 9am appointment, got there 10 mins early and was helped immediately. Explained some of the issues, I was then directed to a counter inside where Matt Bell efficiently took note of everything and told me I could pick the car up before end of day. Matt called me to give me an update a few hours later, and then I got an automated text when the car was ready to be picked up, a few hours earlier than anticipated. When I picked the car up there was no wait, I was in my car within 5 mins. Great service!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I have a 2016 Golf and was having some trouble with my battery, but I work long hours, so taking my car for service was going to be a problem (or so I thought). I was able to get a next day appointment! They have overnight drop off and after hours pick up which is amazing! I left my car there early in the morning before they opened and left my keys in a lock box. Peyman was my service technician and he called/texted throughout the day to let me know what was going on. He sent me the invoice via email so I could pay online, which was also great.

When I picked up my car at 8 pm, I noticed that I had an airbag light on and my steering wheel controls weren't working, which is something that was not defective before I brought it. I called Peyman the following day and he told me to bring the car back to take care of the problem. It was super easy just like the first time. Thanks for the great customer service!</Review>

Emerson Molina is the best!  He went out of his way to explain things and managed to mend, rather than replace, a faulty bit, saving me several hundred dollars.  I've never met anyone at the Santa Monica dealership that wasn't pretty special.</review>

<Text>I just bought a Jetta from this dealership and love it! I worked with Chris Weller, who was a huge help throughout the process. He got me a great deal on my car and walked me through the whole process. He was really patient while I made my decision and answered all my questions honestly! I would definitely recommend working with him if you are planning on buying a car, it was a great experience.< /Text><Resp>None<//Resp>< UserId.>

<Review>Jeff Crawford is the BEST Service Advisor EVER!

I am the original owner of a 12 year old VW and am very diligent about maintenance. Jeff is very knowledgeable, honest, fair, conscientious, goes out of his way to accommodate my crazy freelance schedule, &  always a pleasure to work with. Jeff also explains the priority of services & upcoming service maintenance needed in case i need to spread out the work due to financial considerations.

I will only schedule service with Jeff to occur on days he is working. If you haven't worked with Jeff yet, give him a call!  HE IS AWESOME!

Update July 2015
Another GREAT experience with JEFF CRAWFORD. He's wonderful!! I recommended him to a stranger at Whole Foods who had a headlight out in her VW Bug the other day.. Love him!!</Review>< Pics>

<text>I've been taking my GTI here for almost five years. Just feel more comfortable going to a VW dealership vs. freelance mechanic. Until this last visit, I've always dreaded going. I always feel like I'm being sold something and that it's not about the actual service I'm getting, it's about getting a good review. I've almost always ignored the barrage of emails that follow asking for a review. Matt was the first customer service person that didn't fit that bill. I really felt he had my best interest in mind and that he wasn't just doing what he was doing so that I would give him a positive review. Thank you.</text>< Pictures>

I was being helped by Emerson Molina who explained everything to me in detail.  He was so helpful and patient in helping go through the process of finding out if my extended warranty covered the service that I needed.  He also assisted me with the payment process since I sent a friend to take the car in and they text me so that I can make the payment.  That is what I call true customer service.  This way, I didn't have to give my friend my debit card and the payment was processed within minutes.  Way to go VW Santa Monica for streamlining payment options with no hassles!<//review>

I had an incredible experience with Jett (Brigette Richard) in sales and Chandler in finance. These ladies were no-nonsense and got me exactly what I wanted fast. Jett is beyond professional, and does not hold punches. She listened to me and made my deal happen without any muss or fuss. Her charisma is genuine and she doesn't play games. Chandler also listened to me and did not pressure me into anything I didn't want to do on the finance side. If you have an opportunity to do business with these women, take it.<//Review>

< Review>
I had no idea I’d be leaving the SM VW dealership sooo happy!! I originally went in looking for a car that had been sold, so I was really disappointed; however, Alex was so friendly and so great to talk to he had other options- and not just your run of the mill let me just get you in a car convo. He was great I liked 2 cars a bit out of my budget... but over the next several hours he and Tammy tag teamed my questions and needs (which were a lot !!) and they were able to work out a deal that worked for everyone, more so me I think!!  I could not be more thrilled with my experience. I hate car shopping! and these guys really made it a great experience, and fun!! THANK YOU SO MUCH !! 10 stars !!!!! Picking up my car today !!</Review>

VW Santa Monica is great. I originally came here for service because Pacific VW was too busy. A month later, I had a small thing that had to be performed so I took it to Pacific and they made the repair. However, they also claimed that there were serval services that I needed to have done, some of which Santa Monica had supposedly done. I spoke with Willie and was promised that I could bring it back in to verify that the work had been done. My service rep, Odell, was great when I brought it back in. He was very thorough and even showed me the parts in question, all of which were great, meaning that Pacific VW was trying to play games, while Santa Monica did a great job!< /review>

My experience with Volkswagon Santa Monica was excellent. I was truly impressed by the professionalism, customer service and overall experience, but most particularly with Mr. Odell Hadley. He was an absolute joy to work with on servicing my vehicle. I was beyond pleased with his knowledge & expertise, courteous & kind demeanor and consideration of my time, safety and satisfaction of service. I feel relieved knowing I can count on Volkswagon Santa Monica & look forward to seeing Mr. Odell Hadley again for future visits.<//text>

<review>I liked working with Skyler so this review is for him - he gets 5 stars. I wasn't too impressed by management, however, as they didn't really seem to care about working with me as a customer especially during negotiations. Took a few weeks to get where we needed to and the only reason they got the sale was because of Skyler. Also, when I went to drive my car off the lot I discovered the button that controls the subwoofer would not always appear in my menu. When I researched this phantom button on Google I found out there was a known issue with the software in the car. So before rolling off the lot it was determined I'd have to bring the car in for a possible software upgrade which as of today turned out to be true and necessary. This was on a CPO vehicle, which should have been checked for this... Overall decent experience but I didn't get the love that said they really wanted me as a customer despite being asked the day of my test drive what they can do to earn my business.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Peymon, thanks for the great service. If all service agents were like you dealerships would have a lot fewer complaints. To whom it concerns in Management, this man is your best salesman, even if he is in the service department. I always like having my Euro van serviced at Santa Monica.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This place absolutely deserves the excellent reviews it has. I was having an ABS issue with my Touareg right before I was about to take a long road trip in August of 2016. Luke explained each step in finding the cause and solution to my issue, and they were able to solve everything within my time frame and budget. The quality of service I received here convinced me to get another Volkswagen when I traded in my Touareg.< /Text>

I had my tire replacement service and wheel alignment recently at this place. I went there on two separate trips, both helped by Mr. Michael Gunter, who was very professional and answered every question that I had. It was good experience and I recommend this place to you.</Review>

Debbie Callender offered me wonderful, quick service and got me in and out of the building in less than 15 minutes. She was super friendly and really seemed to know how to do her job right. She also followed up with me within a couple of hours of my car being put in for service and let me know exactly how much I was going to be paying. I got my car back from its routine maintenance within a few hours. Thanks, Debbie!<//review>

I purchased a Tiguan from Hamid and he has been very helpful and professional throughout the whole experience. His knowledge and sense of humor were definitely a plus. He even came in on his day off to seal the deal and gave me a follow up call a few days later to see how I was liking my new vehicle. Would most definitely recommend to friends and family.< /Text>

< Review>
I brought my car in for an oil change last Friday, but ended up finding out that I needed the 60,000 service. Odell Hadley was extremely helpful. During the servicing, the noticed my back breaks were in very poor condition so he also recommended me getting new breaks. While I had only intended to get an oil change for the day, I knew that it was time for both the servicing and brake replacements. Odell took great care of me and was patient with me as I decided whether or not to go through with the break replacement. My entire experience was amazing as it always is. Thank you so much Odell for a great service appointment and for keeping me laughing!</Review>

<Review>Thom Painter was very helpful and professional. I had an appointment for my 10,000 mile service on Saturday. When I made the appointment, I was told that it would take an hour and a half. When I got to VW Service, I found out that on Saturdays it typically takes two hours. Thom apologized for the miscommunication when I made an appointment, then told me he would do his best to get me done in an hour and a half. Lo and behold, I was out of there in about 45 minutes. Great experience.< /Review>< pictures>

The service I received at Santa Monica Volkswagen was great thanks to my advisor Peyman Kahen! He was professional and efficient. I will definitely return there if needed.< /text>

<Review>I had the best car-buying experience of my life at Volkswagen Santa Monica.  Thanks mostly to the extremely friendly, helpful and well-informed brand specialist, Blake Bovelsky.  He answered all my questions promptly and walked me through the entire purchasing process.  He made a process that can be stressful and daunting very comfortable and fun.  If you go to VW Santa Monica, ask for Blake specifically.  He'll treat you right.  The sales manager Jason and finance officer Chandler were also great!  A great experience overall.  I got the car I wanted at the price I wanted.  Do car business here with these people.< /Review>< Pics>

I had a great experience! The staff was courteous and professional throughout the process. They honored the deal I found online and were highly accommodating when I asked to explore my options and change some of the terms. Lots of patience, minimal pressure, and didn't waste my time with extra information. I worked with Inez Carrillo and Bridget Stennis; both are rockstars! Bridget even offered to return my rental car on my behalf. Overall, I am happy with the deal I got and I highly recommend them!<//Text>

Took my wife's new Golf wagon in to have the side mirror repaired. The service tech, Luke Young examined the problem and was able to reuse all of the parts, save the one that had broken, saving us a lot of money.
The whole repair was done sooner than estimated and the mirror looked as good as new.They were even able to remove scuffs that I thought were going to be permanent.
I would have no problem recommending Santa Monica VW to anyone</text>

<Review>Jeff Crawford has been my service consultant since I bought my car in 2003.   He is always cordial, helpful and is very knowledgeable.   He goes out of his way for that extra service.    In his absence from time to time I have used other consultants and everyone I have worked with at VW Santa Monica has been outstanding.<//Review>< rating>

Our 2016 Tiguan had a recent battery problem. Rodrigo Aqueveque  ensured that our needs, concerns and repairs were addressed and resolved immediately. In addition when I went to pick up the repaired car other members of the Volkswagen Santa Monica team were equally helpful in addressing all my questions. Overall it was an excellent, highly professional response by Rodrigo and the VW team.< /Review>

Appointment was made a year in advance and kept.  When I arrived at the dealership I was met by Jose Flores.  He explained what they would do for my service.  I asked him how long it would take and he said about two hours.

Two hours later, Jose said my Passat was serviced and ready to go.  They drove it up to the waiting room entrance and I was on my way.< /Review>

This was the first time that Carlos Bernal was my service advisor. I am glad to see that Carlos was selected for this job as I have been a customer for about 10 years and he was always helpful and courteous when dropping my cars off for service.  He provided a clear estimate of the time it would take and what the service included. He followed up when the car was ready and there was minimal wait time. Thank you, Carlos.</Review>

Service dept: Customer service has been so lacking the last few years I finally gave up on them.  Not sure what the problem is but even with an appointment it can easily take 40 minutes to even be acknowledged.  It's really every negative stereotype you've heard of about dealership service and I'm not doing it anymore.  I came here exclusively for service to my GTI from 2014-2020 and I'm just done.  If you give a less than perfect score for the service you get repeatedly harassed on the phone about giving them a better score and a sob story about how VW management set the system up.  Maybe do better or work somewhere else?< /Text>

I took advantage of SM Volkswagen's Ladies Day special--my car was serviced while I had a manicure.  Emerson Molina at Santa Monica VW is their best service representative and I always ask for him.  He's knowledgeable, honest and sincere.  SM VW is lucky to have him as an employee.<//text>

<review>I'd rather wash my car with a toothbrush than go to a car dealership...Skyler Cox changed that. I spoke to him on the phone prior to going in, I told him exactly what I wanted, how much I was going to pay, nothing more nothing less. Skyler gave me the sunshine & rainbows promise, obviously I had no faith in his words. But much to my surprise, there was a pot of gold waiting at the end of the rainbow when I got there! He had the exact car with my specified requirements at the price I request ready and waiting for me. I was in & out, and left with a smile!

The service at Volkswagen Santa Monica is exceptional - particularly the speed of service and staff friendliness. Ivan Montejano was extremely helpful throughout the entire experience, from the time I called until I picked up my vehicle. The new texting service kept me well informed and I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. I will definitely be back again.<//text>

This review is in regards to the service department.

These guys will do what they can to make sure your car is in tip top shape. Even if you have taken your car elsewhere, they will look at the problem and do what they can to take care of you.

I worked with Odell Hadley on my 2005 Jetta. I came in after failing to pass smog. Apparently, one of the computer systems was "not ready" I had driven many miles and still it was not ready. I thought something was wrong with the car. Odell work with his technician to make sure there were no faults in the engine computer system and that everything was running smoothly. I had no problems leaving the car. It was July 4th weekend. He kept in contact with me and walked me through what they were doing.

That is service! Come by and chat with these guys. If you like your car, these guys will love it and make sure your vehicle is pampered.< /review>

Omid Moayyeri was the best person for us to work with during our car purchase. We went to many over dealerships (over 10), and he was the only person we felt like we trusted and gave us a very genuine experience. So glad he helped us with our purchase, and we hope others who read this will try to work with him!<//text>

I also bought a service package from Chandler in the finance department and she was great. She called me right away to talk about my options and we settled on a package quickly and easily over the phone. She was a pleasure to deal with. The guy that I did test drives with in October 2015 was good as well. I wish I remembered his name, I only remember that he was new at that time. He didn't overly pressure me which is HUGE. I didn't have the same amazing experience with the person that worked with me in the service department, but it wasn't horrible either. I felt like the person helping me was having a bad day or disliked his job and was taking it out on customers. But the service itself and everyone else in the service department were fine.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Typically, scheduling and sending a car in for service is something I dread. I was so pleasantly surprised at how easy and pleasant Peyman Kahen and the rest of the team at VW Santa Monica made the entire experience. Peyman explained everything perfectly, sent me text messages and photos keeping me up-to-date on the work they were doing and recommending, and really went above and beyond in making sure my service was done properly and quickly. Everyone was really pleasant and positive. I'll go back again for sure.</review>

Made my appointment for a routine service maintainence but found that you still wait in the normal line which was 2 hours that day. Then I was told that there is some issue with the car and they should fix it in an extra hour which didn't happen and I couldn't get a loaner car to go home or to my meetings. Then I finally found a ride after waiting for 4 hours which is quite annoying. If you plan to do service here, I recommend dropping off the car because the waiting area is not comfortable at all, The other locations like the one in long beach at least have a proper coffee machine.< /review>

I've been toying with the idea of leasing an e-golf for months. I finally leased one yesterday from Alex Gross who's the kindest and most knowledgeable salesman I've ever encountered in a car dealership!

I live in Pasadena, in fact, I live right around the corner from the Pasadena Volkswagen. I test drove the e-golf for the first time there. And my experience was really awful. They were rude and pushy and uninformative. I have a background in sales and management so my tolerance for bad salesmen is very low. So, I liked the car, but didn't feel like dealing with bad customer service. Started calling other dealerships... And really just wasn't getting the attitude or information I wanted.

But then, THEN, I called Santa Monica Volkswagen. And Alex just happened to be the first person I got on the phone for information about the e-golf. And he was amazing. Kind, patient, warm, informative, he sounded like he actually wanted my business. I decided then and there that whenever I finally was ready to lease, I was leasing from him without question.

Months have passed since that first conversation. He would call just as a little reminder every once and again, just see if I was still interested, but was never pushy. I simply wasn't in a place where starting a lease was right for me, and he understood.

SO, finally, I was ready to go. Three months later. Time for a new car! I emailed Alex and he was just as kind as every time I've talked with him, said they had a great stock of the e-golf SEL and they had the color I wanted!

An hour and a half drive to Santa Monica from Pasadena. My husband laughing at my insistence that we go to this specific Volkswagen dealership for this specific sales person. Once we got there he understood why I was insistent. Alex was just as warm and welcoming and knowledgeable (and so patient!) in person.

A very long test drive (one for me, one for my husband) later, a couple of hours, some paperwork (the finance person who helped me was also fabulous), and I drove home (2 hours in LA traffic at 5 pm) in my shiny new e-golf!

Wherever you are in LA, Alex is the guy to go to. The whole staff at Volkswagen Santa Monica is kind and caring and you'll leave feeling like you not only got a new car, but also a couple new friends.

TL;DR: I sat in a cumulative 4 hours of LA traffic to and from Pasadena just to lease from Alex Gross at Volkswagen Santa Monica. He's awesome, their staff is awesome. You won't regret going here.</Review>

Debra Callender did a great job of tending to my car's standard 10,000 mile service as well as giving me excellent attention with several issues I had been experiencing.  She was expedient and efficient with getting me into the system and even went above and beyond when I told her I had a time constraint.  Debra took it upon herself to ensure that my car was done in the quickest amount of time possible and she lived up to that promise.  I'm so glad I have Debra as my advisor now.<//Text>

I had a wonderful experience at the Santa Monica Volkswagen dealership. I came in to get my oil changed and they were quick to help me, the service turnaround was also quick, and the customer service I got  from Peyman Kahen was exceptional - so nice and professional and called and emailed to let me know when my car was ready. I will be sure to go back for all of my car needs in the future!<//Review>

I had an incredible experience working with Odel! He was able to help me think through the best, most cost effective and most pressing service needs of my car with kindness, patience and extraordinary customer service! I walked out feeling that I was not pressured into anything and free to make the smartest decisions about servicing my car. I will definitley be going back for all my major car service needs and hoping to work with Odel as he made a very difficult situation hundreds of times less-stressful!< /Review>

Stopped by here after my appointment was cancelled at another VW Dealer (poor experience there), and I can tell you this will be my new spot till I need to get a new car.

Matt Bell set me up and made sure to address all of my concerns, very professional. Jason Harris was our Mechanic and he did an amazing job. Kept my wife and I informed through the entire process and checked much more than I expected for the service we needed. Best mechanic I've had since moving to SoCal, and even before the move!

Turn around time was quick and efficient, this is my go to place for work on my car AND for when I need to get a new one... which I doubt will be soon since Matt and Jason took such good care of my VW!!!!!</Review>< pics>

Luke Young was the ultimate professional.
He was early to our meeting and wearing a big smile and greeted me with a firm hand shake. He was honest and upfront with me, and got me back on the road in very timely manner.

WORST CAR BUYING / LEASING / FINANCING EXPERIENCE EVER

After speaking with the Sales Rep for 2.5h, being given a verbal sealed deal and even having already purchased the insurance for the car, they all of a sudden tell me they are unable to lease the car to me because although my credit score was 700+ their bank declined eventually.

They promised to check again the next day and after I have followed up several times (most of the time they didn't answer their phone), I'm being told I would have to buy the car if I wanted it.

I could afford buying it but that's not what I was asking for nor promised by the Sales Rep. Not only was this the biggest waste of my time but also a huge scheme and disappointment. Is this how you make people buy your cars???

One would assume that a car dealership already having reputation troubles (VW emission scandal) would at least put more effort into their customer service.

Never again.<//Review>

It was busy in the service department, but I was warmly greeted and assisted promptly for my 8:00am appointment.  The person whose name I didn’t catch went and got service manager Odell Hadley.   Odell was friendly, knowledgeable and courteous. He told me it would take approximately 1 1/2 hours and gave me an estimated cost.  Imagine my elation when my car was done in under an hour and $50 less than the estimate with a COMPLIMENTARY tire rotation.  Thank you Odell and awesome VW of Santa Monica team!< /Text>< pics>

I have a 2013 Beetle and my rear brakes were in need of repair.  When I arrived at the VW Service Center in
Santa Monica, I was immediately greeted then Matt Bell came out to hear my issues.  The car was looked
at and Matt explained each issue.  He was very knowledgeable and personable.  I was then shuttled
back to my home.  My car was serviced in a timely
manner and I am very pleased with all aspects of
the service.    Thank you Santa Monica VW.< /text>

<review>My wife and I recently purchased a new Golf from VW Santa Monica. Donia Chiarizia, our sales rep, made our buying experience the best we've ever had...and we've purchased many cars over the years.

Donia is thoughtful, very knowledgeable, fun to work with and genuinely interested in providing outstanding service. Donia  actually came to work on her day off to accommodate our schedule. Also, a special thanks to Sam, finance manager, for being highly professional and providing a fast and efficient contract signing process.

If you are considering a VW, we highly recommend reaching out to Donia. Thank you Donia!< /review><UserId.>117428707389786424300< /UserId.><Name>russ ditusa< /Name><Rating>5</Rating><Pics>None</Pics>< date>

<Review>Santa Monica VW has great customer service. Every time I schedule a service, they are very communicative with the status. On my last visit, Peyman Kahen called with updates on estimated costs and progress. He also followed up the next day to ensure everything was okay.  There is a complimentary drop-off shuttle service which makes dropping off the car and heading to work feasible (within a 5 mile radius). Thumbs up to that.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45< /gmapID><Name>Dinah Tham</Name></record>

< review>
Hi, I did buy a car from this place! They were very rude and unprofessional people starting from the manager, they left me waiting for 4-5 hours just they were playing and talking to each other and making fun of things starting from the manager the blond lady to all 3-4-5 guys there. I call them they told me different I went there different,I got the car was a different conversation then before I had to sign the price changed however they want it! I call that very terrible thing I would never go there again. And was my first and last time buying something from there. I think this is a big problem. I hope the general manager sees that! And I would like an explanation.<//review>

<Review>Wesley Rockett greeted me prior to my test drive and stayed with me through the final delivery of my new car.  He stayed very mellow throughout the whole process until his boss and I came to an agreement on the price and monthly payments.  I have referred a couple of friends who are in the market for a new car to deal with him since he made my experience feel like an agreement we both can live with rather than a pressured situation.  Thanks Wesley!!!.</Review><GmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45< /GmapID>< Time>

<review>From the time I called to say I was coming in to shop for a car to four hours later when  I drove out with a new Jetta SEL Premium lease, the experience was a pleasure.

Donia Chiarizia took me for three test drives (Jetta Basic, Passat, and Jetta SEL Premium) so I could find the car I really liked.  She patiently sat through and helped me build a comparison chart with all the different features and prices.

The best part was that at no point did I feel pressured or rushed, even though the final paperwork took the friendly VW SM team past closing time.  This was in special contrast to my experience at the other manufacturers dealerships (BMW, Audi, Infiniti, Volvo, Lexus) I had visited in the preceding day and a half.

I would recommend VW SM and Donia to anyone looking for a VW!</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1531229728917, 'text': 'Thank you for your time and feedback.

We had a great time working with Vitaliy Konovalov! He didn’t try to push me into a bigger / fancier car, but instead listened to what I wanted and helped me find the car I needed at the price I could afford. Definitely go see him for your VW needs!

P.S. VW does not offer any service/warranty for the first XXX miles like most brands, so ask ahead of time how much the service packages cost and be sure to include that in the price your discussing. It can be quite the sticker shock if you don’t. Still even after including it, VW is still the best deal around for what you get!</Review>

I purchased the VW Beetle as my lease was up.

Everyone was very accommodating...especially our salesman Mo Aboushaban who had
leased the car to me.  Mo is terrific.  The sales manager whose name I don't have handy was very helpful as well.

Also, Sarah who completed the paperwork was especially pleasant and explained
every question I had.<//review>

I have been helped by Jeff Crawford on numerous occasions, and he is always very helpful, personable, knowledgeable, and he finds solutions for me that work within my budget when needed.  I always have a good experience with Jeff and recommend him highly.<//Review>

I recently purchased a Jetta from Mr. Melvante Williams. He is beyond professional and was very thoughtful in helping me purchase my car. He has kept in touch with me to see how things are going with my purchase and if I had any questions regarding maintenance, etc. It is nice to receive superior customer service. I thought that type of customer service was gone. I love my car and plan to make any subsequent car purchases with him. Kudos to him and Volkswagen of Santa Monica. :)</Text>

<text>Car service dept is good. BUT beware of ripoff used cars. They sell over-priced certified preowned cars and tell me they will buy it back at a good price if I sell it back to them. Turns out their appraisal of my used car after 9 month of driving is WAY worse than the offer at Carmax. Their excuse was that they need $2,000 to have their car "certified". What a BS.<//text>< pics>

I had figured out some time ago that VW made cars that I could be comfortable driving. Because I can easily walk to the dealer from my home, it's also where I've taken my car's for service. Recently, my 2011 Tiguan was in a bit and run accident. I took it to the body shop recommended by SM VW. They watched me that the damage was a lot worse than it looked. When it turned out to have been totalled, and I had talked to the insurance company, I knew that I'd replace it with another Tiguan. Less than an hour later, I got a call from a salesman at SM VW. I told him that I wanted a good, lightly-used Tiguan. We talked about the ones he had in stock, and I told him which one I'd like. (A 2015 just out of lease.) The next day, I walked over there and picked it up. They're financing some of the cost and I'll pay the rest from the insurance check. Everyone involved worked together to make the experience as easy for me as possible. I expect to be driving this Tiguan for many years.< /text></record>

Everyone at Volkswagon Santa Monica goes above and beyond. From the moment you arrive someone will greet you and let you know whats next.
Justin helped me as soon as I drove onto the service lot and listen to what i had to say about my concerns for my car. As a girl its can be intimidating talking about cars, but I never felt this way once with Justin, he kept me in the loop the whole time from start to finish.  He was awesome, its people like him that will keep me returning to VW Santa Monica.<//Review>

This was my first time getting my car serviced at this location. I have had bad experiences in the past with another VW that I would drive an hour away for good service. I am so glad I gave Santa Monica VW a try. Not only were they fast, the representative Odell who helped me was very knowledgeable and reassured me that my vehicle is in good hands.< /text>

<Text>For over five years I've taken my car in to be serviced at the Volkswagen Santa Monica Dealership. The past few services have been handled by service representative Roy Halleluyan. Roy kept me informed on what needed to be repaired with my car and continued to follow up after the maintenance, to make sure everything was still running smoothly. It's comforting to know that I can always count on great service, informative communication, and quality work.< /Text>< Pics>

Shuttle service was very convenient and free of charge to send me on errands until they called me so I could catch a bus back to the dealership. Loved that they topped off my fluids and adjusted my tire pressure as well.</text>

I loved this dealer. Moe Aboushaban helped me out as I walked in asking for some possible car options, he was very friendly and incredibly kind. The following day I went back, Moe had the perfect car for me following my preferences and my budget. The process was easy, quick and I left couple of hours later with a new VW. I enjoyed the whole experience, love my car and I will definitely come back.</text>

Sales and Finance Group did a superb job on providing the automobile choices as well as a speed deal confirmation process.

This is why I am on my 3rd vehicle transaction  with the Santa Monica Team.</Review>

Odell Hadley was my service advisor when I recently brought in my 2016 Jetta for its 10K service.  He could not have been more personable, and he showed genuine interest in my concerns about the car.  It was all taken car of, and I was on my way in good time.
Thanks Odell and SM VW.< /text>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>I had an excellent experience at VW Santa Monica.  My sales rep was very helpful in getting me the car I wanted, helping me decide, being fair during negotiations, and allowing me to test drive different vehicles.  The finance manager was also friendly and detailed in explaining the lease terms.  I even went back in a few days later to ask some questions about the lease terms and the finance staff was very helpful and patient in running some numbers with me. I highly recommend VW Santa Monica for their wide selection of vehicles and their staff's professionalism during the sales, negotiation, lease signing, and car delivery processes.  Thanks again!</Text>< Pictures>

I had a great experience buying my new car here. Originally, I was looking to buy a used car. Mark took me on a test drive. He was very thorough and pleasant. Unfortunately, I had a bad experience with the first salesman I spoke with (hence the 4 stars instead of 5) and left with a bad taste in my mouth. After shopping around other VW dealers I decided to go with a new car instead, and this time spoke with Raufel Muhammed. He was attentive, friendly, and enjoyable to work with during the negotiation experience. He answered all my questions thoroughly, and made sure I understood the whole process. Sam in the finance department was amazing and very helpful as well. Overall I would recommend this dealership despite the original poor experience with the first salesman.< /Review>

Odell Hadley was awesome! You have a great vibe and welcoming personality. I truly felt like my car was going to be taken care of. Service was fast, I came in around 8:30 and my car was done with an oil change AND patches on a tire by 9:30. You guys are awesome!

UPDATE: 2/13/2019

Recently my car was giving me trouble, so I called Vw's dedicated support line for warrantied vehicles, which VW Santa Monica recommended when I first purchased my car.  MAN was it worth it. To start off they towed my car from my home to the shop here at VW SM, and within minutes I get a very reassuring call from Peyman Kahen. He asked me a few questions of what my car was having troubles with, and reassured me that we would stay in constant communication via text and if I had any questions to reach out to him, no problem. We went through a small hiccup on my portion of payment for the service and VW warranty, and he came up with an excellent solution that made sense and reassured me that he is trying to lookout for me. Overall, again and again I get amazing customer service from these guys at VW Santa Monica. I bought a second car from them and will definitely be trading in my lease with them.<//Text>

They did not try to upsell me on any features or unnecessary additions. And I'm happy to say I made a few friends along the way!

Santa Monica Volkswagon Dealership has the best service! My sales woman Bridgette "Jett" Richard is the woman to see! I bought my first car with her and she is so nice and professional. She listened to all of my needs and made the process a lot more simple than I expected. She even called to check up on me weeks later to make sure that I was still happy with my new car... I thought that type of customer service was gone. I love my car and there is no need to go to any other dealership because the other ones do not compare.</Review>

Luke Young is the best! I only use VW Santa Monica whenever I'm in town. No one there likes to see a customer sitting around waiting. They are always on top of things and extremely attentive. I was updated frequently on my vehicle without needing to reach out myself. I have zero complaints.

I was very pleased with VW Santa Monica. From the moment I walked in, Hamid Rezaei was very attentive and friendly, and helped me through the entire process. He knew every detail about the car, was never pushy, and always seemed to have my best interest in mind. I got a great deal on my lease so I was very happy. I will definitely come back to this place for my next car lease.<//review>

<Text>I had an amazing car buying experience from Hamid Rezaei who makes the process as easy and painless as it can get.  I would not only refer him to friends and family, but I now consider him to be a dear friend of my own family.  My girlfriend had leased a car 6 months ago and I was actually in the market so wanted to reach out to Hamid to put feelers out on pricing.  Based on my girlfriend's experience, I called Hamid and a couple hours later I had a new car that was within my budget with all the bells and whistles.  He doesn't push you into a car you don't want, but rather helps you find exactly what you are looking for.  Thank you so much Hamid!

I had the most pleasant experience with Volkswagen Santa Monica. In particular, Willie Rockett, honored the word of another service representative and got the issue with my Jetta resolved efficiently and effectively. I appreciated his genuine concern to help, and will continue to use VW Santa Monica when my car needs service. Thank you!</text>

I got a really excellent service from Mr. Sam Momeny. I just came to Volkswagen Santa Monica to change the engine oil because the service sign of my car was on. There, Mr. Momeny checked my car carefully and quickly. He not only changed the oil but also helped my car to be checked to have no other problems. I'd like to recommend him if my friend has a Volkswagen car and looks for a good guy of service. Thank you very much.</review>

<review>I've had nothing but good experiences here at Volkswagen Santa Monica. On Saturday, took my Bug for it's annual check-up. My service rep, Teagan Biehle, was great. He greeted me at my vehicle, provided me with an update on what they were going to do with my car and ensured that I was "in and out" in a flash. Great guy, great team. Thanks Volkswagen!< /review></record>

Went in for service as I was almost up another 10K miles on my car. Though the main reason for my visit was the coolant leak coming from my GTI for a second time!

Semi disappointed as the problem should have be taken care of the first time around, Roy Halleluyan was of great assistance and took care of the situation for me. He was extremely professional and ensured that the warning light should not return.

Overall I was very satisfied with my experience.< /Text>

We drove in to VW  Santa Monica to test drive a Golf with no appointment  and were warmly greeted right at the parking lot by Bridget Stennis. Bridget immediately arranged a car for the test and  Chris provided very informative features overview and answered all our questions while we were test-driving the car with him. Few days later we when we deiced on the purchase  Bridget were  able to get the exact car we were looking for. No hassle , no games, very friendly and professional. I was pleasantly surprised by everyone at VW Santa Monica.<//text>

Both my wife and I have Volkswagen cars and we always go to this shop. The service is excellent. They fix our problems and treat us like we were in a 5 star hotel. On my last visit I was assisted by Jeff Crawford, who had already helped me out several times before. He was as professional and courteous as always. He knew what the problems were, didn't waste my time and accomodate my transportation when they realize they would have to keep my car until the next day. The day after, he called me  and informed about the problems my car had. Since I couldn't pay for everything, he helped me to prioritize which issues were urgent according to my budget. One of the best service consultants there.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>This is third auto transaction I have made with Santa Monica VW.  When I make appointments to discuss change in VW's or for service, I am greeted by name at the appropriate time.  The salesmen and service people are always courteous and very informative.  I have arrived in the last two transactions with a desire to change autos though my lease was not concluded and Santa Monica VW have found and paved a way for a new lease. I am so pleased with the dealership, I drive from Hancock Park because I know I will receive the complete attention of my salesperson who walks me step-by-step through the new functions on my new 2018 Jetta TSI and/or explains what service is needed and exactly what service was completed and why.  Thank you.<//Review>< pics>

Probably one of the worst customer experiences ever.

After applying through a third party app to lease a vehucle, I was contacted by this dealership and felt very rushed, and that my application was something of a "bother" to them. Maybe it was because using the app cuts down on their commission? Maybe it's the no-hassle fee? Who knows.

I was left a voicemail. I called them back. After not being found in their system, I was connected to a few reps at their dealership and finally given someone to take care of my application.

After speaking to a woman by the name of Bridget Stennis, I was told that she would process my application.  After answering multiple questions, I was excited and she was initially helpful.  However, after speaking with her over the phone it seemed as if she were starting to become annoyed/frustrated with my questions and situation regarding my application.

I quickly then received an email from her.  There was no body to the email, just a subject line with a question: "work address?".

No, "Thank you so much for your application" or "In order to finish this application we'll need this".  Nope.  A subject line question.  That is something so unprofessionally and profoundly rude that I amost considered not even pursuing the application.

Long story short, I had to email Ms. Stennis regarding my application a day later—only to be met with yet another response that felt rushed, and that I was a hassle.

I will never do business with this dealership—not only did I not feel welcomed, but also I felt like a sincere hassle to them.  Maybe it was using the third-party app to do my initial application?  Whatever the reason, it should have been explained.  However, the damage is done and this dealership experience is sincerely a disappointment.

I hope you guys can get it together.</text>

Roy at Santa Monica Volkswagon was great. Took care of me. I dropped off the car in the morning, rode the free shuttle to my house. Car was serviced and ready just about when Roy said it would be. I checked the price for the same service at a local place and it was pretty much comparable except that the local place was having a hard time searching for the VW air filter, so all worked out at the dealer! Also changed spark plugs and got a great free car wash!< /Review>

He was very upfront about all costs for the service and was helpful in explaining everything to me. Overall it was a very pleasant experience and Sam did a great job in making me feel welcome and he should be commended for his service.

I bought my care from Truman De La Cruz back in October, which was a great experience, he was a terrific agent that worked with me on getting what I wanted and not trying to oversell things I didn't want. The battery on my car went out (I bought pre-owned and it is a 2013 so it was about time) and I went into the service center one morning to have it fixed. They were very helpful, the price of the new battery was fair, and their service was really quick. Rodrigo Aqueveque really set me up and I'll continue to work with him in the future.</Review>

I have amended an original 5 star review because I discovered today that my tires weren't rotated. They only need to do a few things and they didn't do at least one of them.
I called to let them know my tires weren't rotated, requested a call back and haven't heard from them now days later.
America's Tire Company in Glendale patched a tire for me today and rotated them absolutely free. The tire they patched I had not even purchased from them but I had purchased one just like it last year. I am still stunned they did all that for free. That is how I discovered my tires had not been rotated. The single tire I had purchased from them just shy of one year ago was in the same place. The tire was purchased just after my 20,000 service.
I don't believe the brake pads were inspected, either, I don't know for sure because I can't get a response from my point guy there.
It's not on the work order that the brake pads were inspected, so I'm assuming they weren't. According to VW this is part of the 30,000 mile service.
I can only hope the rest of the services were completed.
They checked a tire for a slow leak at my request but couldn't find anything. Probably the tire with the nail that America's Tire Company took care of for me.
They do use a good oil for the TDI's. (If it makes it in the car, that is.)<//Review>< Date>

Loved, just loved the way I was taken care of from the moment I stepped out of my Passat 2004 to the moment I drove off.
Calvin Black was attentive, listened well and re-capped accurately what I told him, made sure that not only the problem but the source of the problem with the car was double-checked too.

Additionally the mechanic who was fixing the problem also made sure all liquids (or whatever you call these in a car) were topped off, and surveyed the engine to make sure no other problems/issues were impending.

The service department here is one of the big reasons why I would strongly consider getting another VW when it comes time!</Review>

My husband and I have dealt with VW Santa Monica for several years now and purchased 4 cars and sent our family there as well. We love the service we receive! Melvante and Bridget are always extremely helpful and go out of their way to get us what we need for our family's transportation needs! I'd go back next time and I'd send my friends and family there!<//text>

After a chaotic day dealing with a dying battery for my Golf, I had rushed to Volkswagen Santa Monica right before they were closing (around 6:30PM). The service consultant Emerson Molina, though he was the only one working that day and being swamped with other customers, squeezed my car in to be done by 7PM. Not only did he finish the job by 7PM, but he was very nice and pleasant throughout.

Thank you, Emerson!</review>

Sean Mollabagher worked with me to help me purchase my vehicle. He went the extra distance to ensure I got into a vehicle that suited my needs. He was upfront, honest and straightforward. He cut through the BS to answer my questions candidly. I would highly suggest seeking him out if you are looking to buy a VW vehicle from this dealership.< /review>

Everyone I worked with at Volkswagen Santa Monica was extremely helpful and easy to work with, especially Stefan Kubicki who helped me with my car deal. He listened to my needs and was able to get me a great deal on a lease for a 2014 Jetta. Never having bought a car before I was worried it was going to be a stressful and pressure-filled process but Santa Monica Volkswagen made it easy and painless. I would highly recommend them!</text>

<Text>I had a wonderful experience. These guys are the best! Especially Mark Shapiro who helped me out. Chandler Rabens in finance was also great. It was the most straightforward car buying you can ask for, and they gave me a great deal without the annoying negotiating back and forth. Neither of them were pushy or used sales tactics. Management is wonderful. All in all, if you want a VW, you want to go to VW of Santa Monica.< /Text>< Pics>

I recently leased a GTI at Santa Monica VW and the service was great. Everything was done quickly and they were amazing at getting my lease approved and especially seeing that I have a somewhat limited credit score as I'm originally from Australia. They really have a great team that does there best to make sure you get the best deal and car. A special thanks to my salesman Benjamin De La Cruz Benjamin (Truman) for being awesome and communicative through the whole process. Thanks again guys.</Text>

First of all, I LOVE my car!  It's a Volkswagen Jetta, and it's all the car I will ever need.  Great on gas, German engineering, handles beautifully, smooth ride, and affordable.  I'm Happy!  The service department is extraordinary!  Everybody is nice, as soon as you drive in they have a smile on their faces and treat you and your car like family.  Rodrigo Aqueveque is a tremendous service representative. He is smart, conscientious, knows the product like the back of his hand, honest and hospitable.  He invites you for coffee and a comfortable seat while you wait for your car to be serviced.  Thank you Rodrigo, and Volkswagen Santa Monica.  I appreciate the quality of your service.

I bring my GTI here for all regular service, I appreciate the specialists, they all communicate very well every step of the way. I recently had to have my car towed to VW Santa Monica because of a battery issue.  They got to my car as soon as possible and even fixed a brake light that I didn't know was out.

And I appreciate that my car always comes back washed, no matter how dirty it is when I drop it off!<//text>

I have been going to 'VE Santa Monica for years to have my car serviced there. I was just there last week and Rodrigo Aqueveque was the person of contact and made me feel relaxed about the services I was about to receive and checked on me regularly and updated me on the status of my car. He was great! Thank you Santa Monica VW for hiring kind and competent people.

Such a great experience from start to finish.  Fernando Haro the brand specialist and Billy the general sales manager helped me get the exact car of my dreams!  They were extremely knowledgable and patient and got me an excellent deal!  Everyone at the dealership was very helpful, it was a great experience and I'm very excited about my new car!!< /Text>

I recently brought in my vw for its 60,000 mile service.  Odell Hadley helped me get everything I needed including a loaner vehicle for the day since they needed to keep my car overnight.  Everyone from Odell to the Enterprise rep at vw Santa Monica to the cashiers at the time of pick-up were so helpful, pleasant and fast I love taking my car there for service as I always know thing will go smoothly and the folks who work here are fabulous.  Thank you!!< /Text>

I had a great experience at VW Santa Monica. Yvonne Rodriguez was my service consultant and she was awesome. She was friendly, helpful and made sure that I was able to get my car back in a timely manner. She was very knowledgeable about the process and made everything easy. A+ customer service!

The team working on my car completed the service very quickly, and I appreciated the complimentary car wash afterwards. I will definitely be returning to VW Santa Monica for all my service needs.< /review>

It's great to know that whenever there's something wrong with my car or he's due a scheduled service, that I can count on Roy Halleluyan and his amazing team at Volkswagen Santa Monica to deliver the best (customer) service possible!  It definitely adds to the Fahrvergnügen!</Text>

This is already second time Bridget Stennis handles the renewal of my Lease. And once again she surpassed all my expectations. That is why I decided to share my experience.
Bridget asked me what exactly I want and found deal for me that matches my request precisely: car feature to car feature, car color to car color, $ to $. In addition it took only 2(!) hours from the moment I left my old car to the moment I drive out of SM VW dealership in my new car.
Perfect experience with highly motivated, well-prepared, knowledgeable professional!!</text>

It's been almost 2.5 years since I bought the car from here and still NO wheel cap. I even drove back to the dealer and spoke with Danny Nguyen. He promised me he would send it to my address 2 months ago and I'm STILL waiting on my wheel cap. I've tried contacting them regarding the matter, but Volkswagen Santa Monica doesn't care about customer service! I'd give them 0 Stars if I could.< /review>< Rate>

< Review>
I have been a client of VW Santa Monica since 2004 and have consistently had great service! What does great service entail? Professionalism, and a staff that always listens and responds to my needs and concerns. Efficiency and timeliness: work is done quickly, correctly, and right the first time. Friendly: they care as much for my car as I do, and treat me with personal attention. Most importantly, I trust them, and always feel that I am being treated fairly.  I recommend Peymen and the team at VW Santa Monica 100%.<//Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>Peyman Kahen is very professional, honnest, gives you the best advice and make you save money whenever possible. He knows a lot about your vehicle and your file. He applied a nice discount on my bill because he found out about some extended warranty that I purchased a while ago and kind of forgot about it. He's very articulate, walk you through from beginning to end. In short, I feel really good working with him - stress free!</review>< Pics>

Big thanks to Rodrigo Aqueveque at Volkswagon of Santa Monica! I was a new customer and going to a new place can always be a bit nerve-racking. Rod was friendly and helpful from the first phone call and got me in the next day when I was in a pinch. He called back when he said he would with updates, which is not something I have encountered before and I really appreciated! Rod even surprised me with a discount when I picked up my car for being a nice customer, so nice!! Thanks again, Rod, I'll definitely be back next time my Jetta needs some love.< /Review>

<text>If you looking a VW to buy I would recommend this place because all the team (except the Financial Manager who is too old school) are very professional, courteous and patient. I experienced the VW Garden Grove dealership, which 5 min to my house, well I was very disappointed with the salesmen (impatient, arrogant…). My Salesman was Daniel Tat and he was fantastic he helped me drive my new stick shift car after his work back to my house. Also, he made sure that I was comfortable on how to use the car perfectly.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Thom Painter was my service advisor for my 40k service on my 21013 GTI and the whole experience was great. The price I was charged was what i was quoted on the phone minus the 10% off coupon I was emailed. They were finished earlier than promised and Thom texted me and left a VM. He genuinely seems to love his job and it shows.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Name>Brian Goodman<//Name><resp>None<//resp></record>

<Review>I went in for a general service after the light went on it my car. Peyman Kahen was my assigned rep and the whole thing was done so smoothly. I appreciated his quickness in getting everything sorted of what needed to be done and transparency with what was standard and optional. It is easy to have a frustrating day with car service but Peyman made it really easy for me. I will request him when I go in for my next service.< /Review>< Pictures>

Purchased my Cabriolet at VW Santa Monica in 2000 and have only ever had it serviced here. All these years later, my baby still runs like a dream.
Of late, my service experiences have been off the chart pleasant, a great deal of which has to do with the service staff and the attentiveness of Sam Momeny who really is great about following up and trying to do what he can to take the pain out of what is essentially no one's idea of a good time  - getting your car serviced.
Highly recommend!< /Review>

<Text>I brought in my car for a scheduled 30k mi service.  It was my first time at VW Santa Monica and Rodrigo Aqueveque was my advisor.  The check engine light had come on and, even before knowing what it meant, he verified that my extended warranty was valid just in case it needed to be used.  It ended up being a minor problem covered by a different warranty but I really appreciated how proactive Rod was.  Even with the engine light problem, the resolved that and got my car serviced on time and my GTI is back on the road.  Thank you Rod and VW Santa Monica!< /Text>< Pictures>

Brian Demoy helped us renew our lease and get a new Tiguan. He was extremely professional and very friendly. It was clear he fought hard to get us a really great deal. It's rare when you feel a car salesman is on your side. ;) Definitely glad we're leasing from VW Santa Monica and that we were lucky to work with Brian.< /review>

Peyman was very helpful, but honestly VW dealerships charge WAY too much for service. Every since time I go in for something basic, they come back with a $1k bill for other things (maybe your cars are terrible). To change 6 spark plugs (cost for parts is $60 since I bought them myself), they wanted to charge 140$ for labor...this is a 10 minute maximum job, especially considering VW ordered spark plugs come pre-gapped. Its just ridiculous. Peyman doesn't control this and did his best, but honestly I just hate dealing with VW and how they treat women as idiots when it comes to cars. Not buying one ever again.< /text>

My experience at Santa Monica Volkswagen was by far the best I've ever had at a car dealership, and we all know how tedious, long, and frustrating experiences at car dealerships can get. From the moment I stepped foot in there I was greeted with the best customer service by the really friendly employees. They made me feel like family and like I was meant to go there. From then on I had no doubts that I was buying my car from the right place. Mr. Galindo, the one who sold me the car, treated me like family and was such an excellent help in going through the car buying process with me. I could tell he truly cared about my situation and that made me feel secure. If you go to SMVW to get a car go to him, he is amazing. Everyone there was super nice and helpful. They made me feel like a priority. The blonde lady (I'm so sorry I forgot her name) was very personable and professional. Hamid in finance was awesome, he was so funny and so nice that he made my experience at the dealership actually fun. Overall, Santa Monica Volkswagen is a fantastic dealership and I would highly recommend anyone to buy a car there!<//Text>

I went in to get a new battery. I have had the car for only 2-1/2 years and was surprised that my battery died so soon. However, after reading that my repeated short trips over such a time would drain the battery much faster than if I had taken longer journeys. My service dept guy Peyman Kahen was more than helpful. He gave me a fair price for replacement of the battery aalong with a much better warranty. I was in and out in about an hour.<//review>

I had to take my car in recently due to a battery failure and I have to say the assistance provided by Peyman Kahen was really excellent.  Peyman took the time to sit with me and go through the diagnosis report and also gave me suggestions about maintaining my car better.  It's really good to see people who're really passionate about their job and who show the same interest in helping customers.  I'd suggest VW Santa Monica for any of my friends and especially Peyman.< /Review>

<Review>Daniel Wentz was very helpful! As soon as I walked in he came over greeted me. He walked me through the process of my service and explained everything they were going to do to my car. After that he gave me an actuate estimate of my wait time and even told me that there was a Starbucks down the street that I could hangout at while my car was being worked on, or that the shuttle would take me anywhere within 7miles. My service was competed in a timely fashion and they threw in a free car wash!!!

Thanks VW Santa Monica. I'll bet coming back.</Review>< Date>

Ivan Montejano helped me last week at Volkswagon Santa Monica for a service check. He was professional, competent, and accommodating. I truly appreciated his efforts in jumping through a hoop to waive an extra fee for me. He did not have to, but in doing so, he made my day and helped me have the best possible customer service experience.  I feel comfortable returning to Santa Monica in the future due to this positive customer service experience thanks to Ivan Montejano!!<//Text>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>Good/Important stuff:
-Teagan was friendly, helpful, and got to me right away for my 7:30am appt.
-They returned my car to me looking like new
-The place is clean and seemed friendly overall

Not so good stuff:
-Scheduling an appointment was pretty awful.  I wanted to go to this location because its closest to me.  I couldn't get a hold of the service department to save my life.  I was disconnected about 6 times.  Eventually I called "new sales" and finally got a hold of someone, they would patch me through to whoever only to be hung up on again.  All in all it took almost 20 minutes to finally get an appointment scheduled.

- My appt. was at 7:30am and true, they told me it would be 1 hr to 1.5 hrs before they were done.  But, it was more like 2 hrs before I got my car back and I was late for work.

Overall:
This place is friendly and so far has done nice work on my car which ultimately is most important -- but they really need to work on how they take calls.  Also, be prepared to be there for a while.</text>< pics>

<Text>This could be the Zombie Apocalypse!

"Hello? Hello? Does anyone work here? " I watched intently as tumbleweeds glided across the sales floor. "It's been 15 minutes and no one seems to want to help me here." I said to the receptionist "What are you here for again?" She said smacking her gum. " I WANT TO BUY A NEW CAR!" I explained. Another 20 minutes passed and I decided to walk straight to the sales manager. He was busy chatting with a co-worker but reluctantly came outside to see my trade in. It took another 15 minutes. He didn't even give me a card. I called and asked for his email, I emailed him 3 times with no reply. One thing you can say about these guys is that they are consistent. They return calls as rapid as they service you in person.

Also, checked their prices. WHACK! Check the LA times and compare before you buy or lease. These guys are priced above all the other dealers I found.

NOTE* Their service department is decent if you have a car under warranty. Their sales department is out of a Zombie Apocalypse movie. Don't buy here.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I brought my 2014 VW Tiguan into Santa Monica Volkswagen for a Turbo problem and was helped by Odell Hadley. He was very professional, courteous and efficient in getting the service dept. to resolve the problem in a timely manner. I highly recommend Odell as your service adviser. A job well done! This is one happy customer! I thank the entire VW crew!

I leased a VW 2009 Rabbit here back in 2009. I was served by a sales-person who stank of alcohol and cigarettes. Even though I came in as a result of a published lease deal the manager (as usual) tried to jack up the monthly payment and only when I threatened to walk out with a cry "You people are totally wasting my time!" did he back down. Generally one gets the feeling they don't really respect your business here. I seemed to be invisible to everyone here in general. When I brought the car back for service due to regular maintenance required on the vehicle the experience was just as bad. The front-man greeting and organizing people was a nasty little jerk. The people behind the counter are only slightly better. It's a crapshoot, one time I got a bad one, another time, a decent guy. Overall, I don't think I'm coming back for more...</text>

Had a really great experience buying a used car last month from Sean Mollabagher! As a first time car buyer I was a little nervous about going to the dealership and was worried I'd be overwhelmed, but as soon as I met with Sean I felt much better.

Sean was SUPER helpful, very well informed, not pushy at all, and seemed to really have my best interest at heart. I told Sean what I was looking for and what features were important to me and he helped me find the perfect car for me, never trying to push cars on me that I wasn't interested in. Once I found my car, Sean helped me through every step of the process, through trading in my old car, purchase, registration, even insurance, and made it quick, painless, and truly an enjoyable experience.

I highly recommend Sean to help you buy a car!! I drove home from SMVW the same afternoon super happy with exactly the car I was looking for. Could not be happier!!< /Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Two weeks ago I had a very pleasant experience at the VW Santa Monica for doing the standard 50 mile service and changing the front tires. Debi Callender was my Service Advisor who did an amazing job. Not only did she gladly answer all of my questions, but she also kindly took the time on a very busy day to call another VW service center to double check if there was anything missing from my car's last service. She also called me after I dropped off my car to update me on its status and when I picked it up the same day, she walked me thoroughly through some features I was unaware of. Overall, Debi provided a very personable experience with excellent service; it was my first time at this location and it is definitely not my last.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I purchased a pre-owned vehicle from this dealership in 2016. I’ve had to have it serviced for a couple different things including a transmission fluid leak (required towing) and tire damage. Both of these repairs were covered by warrantee, yet in both instances their service team told me otherwise. In the first case they specifically told me towing wouldn’t be covered and in the second case that my tires weren’t covered I did my due diligence and checked my warrantee to push back on them, and successfully corrected them on both occasions, saving myself a significant cost. The issue for me is with integrity. After the PR issues VW has had recently, you’d think their teams on the ground would be more careful about honesty and transparency with their customers. This treatment left a sour taste in my mouth. I would not purchase another vehicle from this dealership and I’m actively seeking other servicing locations.<//text>

My experience with VW Santa Monica was absolutely great. Raufel Muhammad worked hard  to get me the best deal on a new Passat. He's friendly, knowledgeable and went above and beyond to make me happy. I had a ton of questions and he never hesitated to answer them as thoroughly as possible to ensure that I was satisfied. As far as leasing a car goes, honestly, you can't ask for anything better. The whole team there is wonderful. This is my second lease with them and they are definitely my go-to. Thanks so much!< /Review>

<Review>Roy Halleluyan is my service rep at Santa Monica VW and as always exuded a exemplary degree of professionalism and customer service. He went out of his way to get me  the best price possible on my repair. I know this not just because he told me but because of his actions - he wanted to wait to confirm that he could get me the lower price before they started replacing parts. He was also wonderful in communicating with me about what exactly was happening with the car and outlined exactly what his team's plan was to fix it. I will always go to Roy for my VM Santa Monica service needs.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45</gmapID></record>

Buying a car always used to make me cringe.  The hours of torture at the dealer is cruel and unusual punishment. Those days are over because this dealership has a customer for life if I can go to Vante Williams again.  I had the most awesome experience at SM VW!  First of all, I had many conversations over the phone with Vante Williams, and he was always very nice and helpful. He said it would be easy if I just came in, but I wasn't convinced. I was trying to do all my footwork before I came in but actually that wasn't even necessary, because when I did finally come in, I was out in less than an hour! He asked me a couple of questions, then worked his magic getting me what I wanted.  He really listened and delivered.  He never tried to get me into a car I couldn't afford. All I can say is that he really was great and was available even after I drove off the lot.  So don't be scared, or suspicious like I was, just call him - He really makes it painless.<//Text>

Bridgette Richard provided excellent service again as we just leased another VW Passat, a great 2014 with a sunroof. She helped us get the best deal to serve our needs, for our now 4 person family, with a beautiful new car. Her customer relations is like no other; she is enthusiastic, warm, knowledgeable, and very very helpful. We feel blessed to have met her 3 years ago at the dealership, and will continue to go back to VW Santa Monica because of her.< /Review>

Driving the other night and my engine/exhaust suddenly sounded like a Harley Davidson with backfire.  Took it into VW Santa Monica and was assisted by Luke Young.  Very professional and courteous service.  Turned out the catalytic converter cracked on a seam with the manifold, so it was all replaced under CPO warranty.  Would not hesitate to have my VW serviced at VW Santa Monica.  Luke Young was also very responsive and helpful, he kept in touch with me via text message, and even when he was out one day, he made sure that I was assigned to another service rep (Carlos) who also called me to let me know how the service was proceeding.  Overall one of the smoothest service experiences I've had at a dealer.</review>< pictures>

<text>Today was my first time at VW Santa Monica, and the service is fantastic! I've been going to various other Volkswagen locations for five years, and I definitely recommend SM service department over all others. I  didn't have an appointment, but there was no wait. Peyman Kahen took care of my car and he was the friendliest, most positive person that's ever helped me at a VW. Also want to shout out the service greeters and valet guy, because they were smiling the whole time :)<//text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45< /Gmap_id></record>

It's been a week since I picked up my Jetta. I love my car and I had to let you know that the team at Volkswagen, Santa Monica is amazing! Their attention, consideration, and expertise impressed me immediately.
Moe Aboushaban was my brand specialist and salesman. He thoroughly educated me about the vehicle and was responsive to all of my questions. Billy Rinker,general sales manager and Mark Lambert, finance manager assisted me in understanding all of the documentation that I signed in order to lease my car.
I have bought and leased other cars in the past, but this experience was the best!! If you want great service and guidance when purchasing or leasing a car, your next stop has to be Volkswagen, Santa Monica!!  They're AWESOME!!!!<//text>

I just got my pre-owned Tiguan from this dealership and am extremely happy.
Lina Martin was super helpful in finding a pre-owned car that suited my needs perfectly and was present at every stage; ensuring things run smoothly. To receive the car I was picked up from my home and driven to the dealership by a very friendly guy and there met with Lina who talked me through the whole process. All in all this was a very pleasant experience and I would recommend this dealership and my sales representative to my friends.<//Text>

<text>We leased a brand new Passat from this dealership in 2014. When we received the car, the front of the hood's paint was faded. The salesperson who delivered the car told us that, it's the way it's washed, it will be okay once the car dries out. The paint became more and more faded as the year passed by. We finally took the car to a body shop and the body shop told us that the car was already involved in a car accident and a Micky mouse paint job was done to fix the damages by the dealer. I was frustrated, why didn't the dealership disclose that to me? How about if they had tamper other safety features such as the airbag of the car? So I called VW of Santa Monica and to my surprise they admitted that the car that was leased to me was indeed involved in a crash. I was frustrated that why I wasn't advised, they told me that  legally they didn't have to advise me since the damage wasn't big enough. So they were saying that they might have obeyed by the law, but they had failed ethically and morally. However what they claimed could be disputed, in California you must let the consumer know if the damage is more than a certain threshold.  Anyway, they promised that we wouldn't be charged when we returned the car. So we returned the car and guess what? We are being charged by VW, I alerted VW about the situation. So I received a phone call from VW of Santa Monica, the lady was yelling at me telling me that they promised to pay for the faded part not the dent. And she yelled at me saying "You're pushing hard" and she hung up on me.  So let's do a summary: I got a damaged car, I wasn't notified that the car had previously been damaged.  I drove the damaged car, then I am paying for the damages and also I am being yelled at by a shady car dealer personnel  for asking them to pay for this?  If you're shopping for a new VW, skip these guys!  The chances are they're going to sell you a car that had already been involved in an accident. I will  spread the word and make sure nobody falls victim to these scam artists.   Do not trust this dealership! They lack ethic, professionalism and common courtesy.  They are the reason that we will NEVER drive another VW ever again.<//text><date>1520050536416<//date></record></dataset><record>

Actually shocked by the unprofessionalism in the show room. I am a returning VW customer who came to get another car. While going over the terms of the lease price I was called stupid by the sales man under his breath when I did not accept the terms of the deal. He Then called over the manager who he then preceded to insult as well. Then, To top it off the manager told me to go drive a civic.....(don't know what that means but the man clearly did not not know that I already owned a VW). Extremely unprofessional.< /Text>

<text>I was in the market for a car, but wasn't sure I wanted another Volkswagen after the diesel emissions scandal. Still, the siren song of the Golf was calling me, so my girlfriend and I went to VW Santa Monica last weekend to look around. Out of all of the people I've dealt with at car dealships, Skyler Cox is hands down the nicest I've met.

He showed me around the selection of used and new cars and quickly sensed my soft spot for the Golf. I had the Wolfsburg trim on my mind, but ended up taking an SE for the spin, since they didn't have a Wolfsburg with automatic transmission on hand. It felt more like a joyride with a buddy than a test drive with a salesman. Skyler shot the breeze, answered all my questions about the car, and demonstrated the features I wasn't familiar with on the newer Golf.

Once I was considering making a purchase, I was referred to Vante Williams to talk price. It was clear that he's been selling cars for a while, and he tried to throw me off with a lot of hypothetical numbers and scenarios at first, but ultimately we were able to agree on a satisfactory price. Vante even gave me a hug! Special shout-out to Samantha in finance who was super friendly while we went through all the paperwork.

Skyler, bless his heart, delivered my new Golf to my home the next day. I'm very pleased with the car (in these very early days of our relationship) and my overall experience at VW Santa Monica. All in all, we were at the dealership for around 6 hours, but it wasn't a boring or painful process. Hoping their service department is just as pleasant when I bring it in for a check-up next year! Definitely stop there if you feel like chatting with some friendly salespeople, and maybe even consider buying a car, if that's a thing you need!<//text>< pictures>

Shop with Raufel Muhammad!! He's wonderful, stuck with my mom and I for hours test driving cars a million times, sometimes the same car twice.

A saleswoman on the lot (possibly Brigette?) was awful. Extremely sneaky and backhanded -KNOWINGLY sold the car I was about to purchase out from under me and couldn't have cared less about it. Raufel handled it very professionally and even brought down the price on a better car to match the price of the car I was prepared to buy.

If you are interested in a car at Volkswagen, go see Raufel at the SM dealership! He's awesome!! (But definitely stay away from Brigette)< /review>

<Text>My experience was great. Truman de La Cruz from Santa Monica dealership was very straight forward and helpful in understanding my needs and my budget for a new car. Because of his professionalism and knowledge of the car is why I bought my new Jetta/se.

I took my VW GTi to Volkswagen Santa Monica for its 40K mile  maintenance. My service advisor was Ivan Montejano. He answer all my questions and made the process very smooth. I asked Ivan to save me the old air filter, and i was delighted to see it in the back of the car. Thanks!< /review>

Good, swift service and clear information. Car retured in time, fixed up as agreed and washed clean. Roy Halleluyan worked hard as always and set the standard for how every car service station should work. Job well done. Will not hesitate at all to come back.

My wife and i were looking for a used/"pre-owned" volkswagen and wandered into the Santa Monica dealership.  After looking around for a few minutes, we were greeted and then fully assisted by Sean Mollabagher, a sales rep.  We appreciated tremendously his low-key approach to helping us find a car that made sense for us, and then for his time and energy in making a deal work that also made sense for us.  We felt very comfortable with Sean through the whole process and recommend him to anyone who, like we, has some trepidation about stepping onto an auto dealer's lot and getting the hard-sell.<//Text>

Not my first time at Volkswagen Santa Monica I have been in for an oil change a few times before. Most recently I was in for replacement of a light buld and brakes on my VW GTI. My experience started with a phone call at 7:30 when the service department opened, I was calling to find out about the days availability for servicing my car. Over the phone I was told to bring it in, it would be no problem to get it taken care of. Upon arrival I was greeted by Paymen Kahn, very friendly and knowledgeable. He inspected my car and had a quote prepared for me in no time offered me a complimentary shuttle drop off. Gave me contact info to remain stay informed on the status of my car. About 4 hrs and 30 min later I receive a call by Paymen informing me I can pick up my car and updated me on all the service that was performed. I appreciate the work that was done on my car and done in a timely manner I will continue bringing my GTI to this location, the staff and service is exceptional.<//text>

Yesterday I brought my 2010 Volkswagen Golf into VW Santa Monica to get it serviced. It was at 45k miles and I know it was about time for the normal maintenance.

Roy Halleluyan was my service advisor and he was excellent! He called me to keep me up to date with the process.

I am happy with VW of Santa Monica's service and will absolutely take my car back, thank you Roy for all your help too!</review>

<Text>We have getting repair service from Santa Monica VW from around year 2000.
Now we have our 3rd car from VW and whenever we have an issue about our car, we go to Santa Monica VW.  Because there is a special person who is Jeff Crawford who is reasonable, knowledgeable, and most of all if you ask a help and he would give you extra help in various way. It is nice to have one you can trust to ask about your car....Thanks.< /Text><GmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45< /GmapID>< userid>

Service Department: I've been bringing my 2012 GLI here ever since I bought it, and they are great here. Ask for Emerson Molina. He has been great to work with whenever I bring my car in. He is always so helpful and straightforward. Obviously I don't want anything to go wrong with my car, but I know if something were to happen, Emerson and his team would do amazing work to make everything right.

Sales Department: When I was shopping for my GLI in 2012, Mark Shapiro was helping me find exactly what I want. When they didn't have what I wanted in stock, he advised me what to do if I did find it. I ended up getting my GLI from another dealership, but I wish I could have gotten my car through him. He's a genuinely nice guy and wants to help you find you your ideal car. I saw him when I brought my car in for service, and he gave me pointers on maintenance for my car. Next time I buy a car, it'll definitely be with him.< /review>

This review is in regards to the service I received from Emerson Molina. I've had quite a bit of trouble with my VW since I got in brand new about a year and a half ago. A hassle for sure, but it happens. VW is on top of it which makes it easy. Each time I've worked with Emerson, he has been right on top of everything - making sure I have a loaner/rental car ready to go at the time of drop off and keeping me updated on the status of my car. He is extremely personable and makes the hassle to repairs MUCH less stressful. While I hope I don't have to head in again, if I do, I'll definitely stick with Emerson as my adviser.</Review>

Omid Moayyeri helped me buy a new Jetta 1.4T at the Santa Monica VW location. I initially went there to look at Passats so he was very patient as changed my mind and asked to look at similar options around my budget. I never felt pressured to make a decision by Omid, he was very calm and helpful in explaining all of my options. Can't say enough good things about him, I'll definitely be back to see him in specific for follow-up needs and any other VWs in the future.< /Review>

< Review>
I had been searching for a small convertible for months and having to keep within a specific budget, the search was discouraging.  Until, until....I discovered my new 2015 Beetle Classic Convertible at Santa Monica Volkswagen.  My daughter and son-in-law worked out the details and I literally walked in and within 2 hours drove away with my new dream car with a monthly payment I could afford.  Omid Moayyeri was my sales rep and the one that test drove the car with me and showed me all the wonderful features.  He was soft spoken and patient.....no hard sales pitch.....which I appreciated very much.  Chandler, who was my financial manager, was honest and answered all my questions with pleasure and competence. The entire experience was amazing after all the bad rap car dealers receive.  Thank you so much!  I look forward to returning to your facility to keep my car in tip top shape!  Tamara Lasky<//Review>

If you take your VW in for service here, ask for Emerson - he's the best.  Took my "04 Touareg V8 in for service, and he dealt with the extended warranty company AND arranged for me to have a loaner (brand new Jetta) for a week!<//text>

<text>It is such a shame how downhill this dealership has gone.  ever time i take my car in for service there is an issue. Communication issues on finding out when your car is ready is the worse.  in addition no one can tell you anything about your car.  terribly frustrating and impossible to work with . no records of your warrantyies etc  even though you bought it from that location.  seems silly.

I highly recommend pasadena volkswagenthey are delightful and resourceful.</text><Response>None<//Response><Date>1470255047143</Date><Pics>None<//Pics><GmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45<//GmapID><Name>Nicole Ariola<//Name>< Rate>

Saturday morning I called around to find a VW dealership that would fix/replace a flat tire on my brand new Jetta. The only one that would take me was Santa Monica. They were extremely busy because it was a Saturday and ...like I said....this was the only dealership accepting Walk-Ins with issues other than "routine maintenance". The service I received was exceptional. Emerson Molina was absolutely wonderful, very professional, and very knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend the Santa Monica VW Dealership to anyone. When you go, definitely ask for Emerson Molina. He is the best!!</review>

I brought in my VW Passat for service. My service adviser Damien Griddine was very friendly and listened to my comments. He gave us a detailed estimate. After about 3 h the car was ready for pick up. Everything was quick and easy. Overall a positive experience.<//Text>

<text>While seesawing between a few different SUV's, we finally decided to go with a new Tiguan from Volkswagen Santa Monica. It's a low pressure and professional office; very different than most car dealerships. Our sales guy, Ash, was excellent and is truly why we ended up making this purchase two days ago Saturday. He was professional, cool and gave me the impression that he sincerely wanted to help us get a fair deal for the car.

Excellent experience and anyone interested in a VW should absolutely swing by.</text>< pics>

This was my first experience leasing a car and it was amazing!  Artem Dasov was friendly, helpful, and not pushy.  They met a deal offered by a different dealer and helped me get the VW of my dreams.  He even helped me return my rental car down the street.  Thank you!</Text>

<review>Problem: The convertible top was jammed and my windows wouldn't roll up or down.

I wish they would have looked at my car when they said they were going to, at 9am, as I made the reservation 4 days prior.  I was made aware when I got there, that they only had a half a dozen guys that were knowledgable with my car specifically, the Eos Komfort.
Because they didn't have anyone look at it until 4:30pm, I was basically forced to rent a car (for less than 24 hours) before learning that nothing was really wrong with my car, except for some bolts and screws being loose inside, which is what caused the original issue.

Emerson was a great service rep tho.</review><pics>None< /pics>< time>

Great detective work and great service from VW of Santa Monica.
Peyman is my kind of service writer--always enthusiastic and quite knowledgeable.

Peyman Kahen from Service Department of Volkswagen Santa Monica makes my life so much easier!

Each time I schedule a Service appointment with him in Volkswagen Santa Monica I feel very confident that everything will be done on time and within announced time/budget.

I'm with VW Santa Monica for 2 years already, I'm sure that it is only the beginning of our productive cooperation. Like next service - not even thinking about any other place - taking my cell phone and calling Peyman!<//review>

Volkswagen of Santa Monica sure knows how to treat their customers well - the recent Jetta that I am leasing for my son is the ninth car that I have purchased and/or leased from them since 1992. Melvonte Williams is an exceptional gentleman as well as a fine salesman. I have always been treated with respect and curtesy as a valued customer. I am very pleased with the quality of product and service that Volkswagen of Santa Monica provides.</review>

< Review>
Emerson is the very best!!

He goes out of his way to make sure I am up to date with every step of the process while my car is in the shop and clearly explain all the needs (or lack there of) for it's maintenance. As a result, I am confident that my car is of high priority to VW and the time I need to spend without it is not wasted.

Emerson is kind, patient and always willing take the extra step (or 20) to make sure my car and I are receiving the best care and service. I never feel like he is trying to sell me something extra or exacerbate a problem with my car - he speaks to me as an equal and makes the sometimes difficult process of car repair enjoyable.

I have worked with many service specialists at VW and have never had someone as professional and kind as Emerson. I cannot applaud him enough.</Review>

Jeff Crawford has been making sure my Volkswagon Passat is running at it’s best at all times!  When it comes to LA traffic and wear-and-tear on your vehicle it’s important to have someone in  your corner you can trust! I can always count on Jeff to get the job done well. I’ve tried other service people and other locations in the past and each time I end up coming back because no one no knows my car like he does.  No one takes the time to get the job done right the first time around like he does. I’ve been coming to Jeff at Volkswagon in Santa Monica for over 10 years now and I have to say it’s been one of the best decisions I’ve ever made.</Text>

The transmission on our beetle started acting up (problem that is common with the new beetle). I ended up paying $600+ for a fix that should have been under warranty from VW of America. I got the car back, and it leaks oil now like a car from the 60's. When I took it back, they claimed it must have been something I did. They also returned the car with most of the fasteners that hold the brace under the engine missing. Would NEVER EVER return my car to them.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>As a first time leaser, I could not have asked for a better experience. Brandon Chasin was incredibly helpful and had given us the information that we needed to help us make our decision which in the end was leasing a BEAUTIFUL Tiguan. The entire experience starting when we first walked in, to Brandon going over every little detail inside the car before I drove away for the first time was amazing. There is certainly a lot of information especially for a 1st time leaser but it was never overwhelming and I know that if I have any questions I can call him. When it's time to make another purchase, my husband and I will be coming back and we're looking forward to talking with Brandon again!

Omid was extremely helpful this past weekend with finding me the perfect 2014 VW Tiguan. He was very patient with me as I asked countless questions and spent hours making a decision. They found me the best deal and helped with financing in a way that fit my lifestyle. I am very pleased with my experience and recommend people visit VW Santa Monica and Omid to find their next vehicle.<//Text>

<review>Vante Williams is a great salesman. He was very upfront about the figures when I went to lease my VW. He was flexible on the trade in price for my car.

I was happy with my deal and the customer service with one caveat, which stops me giving a 5 star rating. Not all the various details surrounding electric cars were clearly explained, like the rebate available for the level 2 charger or how the $2500 state rebate works. When I went to Fiat and Nissan all of those things were explained and I was shown the website where I could sort those things out. I was also shown examples of chargers at Fiat and shown how to use a public charger at Nissan. Nissan also explained the various types of chargers to me.

VW of Santa Monica should ensure that their sales people pass on all of this information to prospective EV customers.

Apart from that, thank you very much for a pleasant and reasonable car buying experience.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I've been going to VW Santa Monica for service for my 2010 Eos since I bought the car in 2010. I've consistently had great service. The service reps I have worked with over the years, most recently Peyman Kahen, have given me great advice and reliable information. I will continue to bring my car here for as long as I have a VW.< /review>

<review>I had a PERFECT experience at VW Santa Monica for some recent service I received on my car.

Peyman Kahen over in the service department took excellent care of me and my car and I cannot recommend him or this dealership enough.

Thank you Peyman and all at VW Santa Monica for your help!</review>< GmapID>

I have been taking my car (GTI) here for 3+ years and have always gotten the best service!  On the one off occasions when I have had to take my car to other dealerships, I can see the difference that VW Santa Monica provides.  Emerson Molina has been the guy I alway go to  and I always get top notch service and experience.  Keep it up!< /Text>

This review is for Bridget Stennis, Fleet Manager at VW Santa Monica.  When I found the car I wanted on the dealership's website, I thought it would be helpful to poke around the Internet and see which salesperson I should speak with.

There seemed to be a general consensus that Bridget was the person to go see and I'm so glad that I did my homework.  Bridget was fair, to the point, and very responsive to my questions.  I never felt pressured or rushed and Bridget did all she could for me to get me into the car I wanted at a price I could afford.

I've purchased a lot of cars in the past, but this was by far the easiest deal I've ever made.  So if you've stumbled on this review in an effort to find a solid salesperson at the dealership, just go hit up Bridget at VW Santa Monica and thank me later.</text>

I'm a bit of a cynic and think dealerships tend to replace instead of fix and over charge customers, but Peyman Kahen is honest and prompt. He works for the customer and values the relationship over the sale. While he was writing me up another customer came in and waited specifically for Peyman to help her. I will probably do the same next time I come in.</review>

I just left Volkswagen for my first service on my 2014 Passat and Peyman Kahen was very helpful and went out of his way to make me feel comfortable and up-to-date on all my concerns.

Thanks a million and w=see you next time!

<UserId.>107713343598876695443< /UserId.><date>1426301499413<//date><text>We just leased a 2015 Tiguan today and we have to say - this is THE best place to go for a VW (or car in general).  This is the third car we have leased from this particular dealership and there is a reason we keep coming back!

The minute you arrive at the dealership/service station you immediately feel welcomed.  The staff is genuinely caring which lets you feel at ease while searching for your perfect car.

They really make a huge effort to get you the best deal they possibly can that will fit your budget.  You don't feel like you are dealing with "car salesmen".  You feel like you are shopping for a car with a friend who cares.

The service is prompt, the cars are of course in excellent shape and the service is impeccable.

Wesley Rockett is who helped us out today. SUCH a genuine, friendly, professional man. The GM, Billy Rinker really bent over backwards to make sure we were taken care of.

We will continue to go to this dealership for years to come and highly recommend you do too!!< /text>< username>

Kyle Lewis handled my VW service. He was excellent. I have two TDI Jettas, and the one that needed service is the one I am not driving, because it is a stick shift and I use it when I travel. So, I needed an oil change and one other item. My bill was $155. What helped me the most, however, was the suggestion to go onto the website to register my two Jetta TDIs. The result, within a month, should be that I receive $2000 worth of benefits, to counteract the fact that I bought TDIs in 2009 and 2012. Thanks, Kyle.<//Text>

<text>INITIAL POST:
Moving to a country can be a scary and busy time. When we relocated from London to Los Angeles having no car became a serious hindrance to my work and left us feeling isolated. As we had never needed a car in London we had very limited savings available for a car, which meant buying a used car wasn't an option, the most affordable was to lease a car but having limited established American credit put us in a tricky position. James Marshall at Santa Monica VW was recommended to us by a friend as someone who understood the financial complexities of not being a US citizen and didn't just say no straight away! He was extremely patient, met our budget and also gave us time to think before committing.  I would definitely recommend VW and specifically James to anyone in my situation and also anyone just looking for a good deal!

UPDATE:
It would turn out the James either did not know or misled us about the benefits of 'swap a lease' in order to have full flexibility throughout the duration of your lease. What he failed to disclose or didnt even understand, even when directly questioned, is that for the last year of your lease VW credit do not allow the use of 'swap a lease'. VW corporate and VW credit along with the dealership all believe I was mis-sold and that this was very bad practice. However the feedback I've had is the salesman doesn't work here anymore and shouldn't believe what our salesmen say, ' that's business'....... wow. When are VW credit/ VW corporate going to say dealerships and salesmen that behave like this cannot have access to our products? I accept that i'm the fool and that I shouldn't have signed but I didn't think that when I questioned part of the lease they would be allowed to lie in that fashion. I hope they retrain their salesmen immediately as when I went back in and played dumb they are still using swap a lease as a tool!!<//text><date>1546724332011< /date>< gmapID>

<review>My wife and I just recently moved back to Santa Monica from Chicago and were in need of a car. Omid Moayyeri was a pleasure to work with, kept our goals in mind, and delivered us great results. We never felt we were being pushed or had to deal with any of the "salesy" stuff you anticipate at car dealerships. If you're in need of a car and don't want to put up with typical hassle that comes with leasing/financing a new car, contact Omid.<//review>< pictures>

I got my first Volkswagen Jetta in 2011 from this location. I have loved my car and the service that this dealership has provided me over the last two years. I lease my car and had only 11 months left on my lease and got a call from Armen at Santa Monica Volkswagen about the option of trading in my car early for a new 2013 model. I immediately jumped on the opportunity and I can say that I got more than excellent or superior service I got the red carpet treatment. Armen, Chris, Billy, Inez and their team were determined to make me a fully satisfied customer and I can honestly say I walked out knowing I got the best deal possible. Not only did I get a new car and a fabulous deal, but I got the best service from the best people in the business. They knew I wanted to walk out satisfied and truly did everything in their power to make that happen. I am moving out of the area, but will definitely have to make the trip back to Santa Monica Volkswagen in 3 years when my lease is up because I am now a fully dedicated and loyal customer! I would recommend all my friend and family to use Santa Monica Volkswagen because there is no better service than they provide!< /text>

<review>I've been driving VW for about 16 years now, two Jettas. Both from Santa Monica VW. Throughout the 16 years, I've seen many changes at this location. This week, I took my Jetta in for a 100k service. Exceptional service by Odell Hadley from start to end. Great personality and very approachable. He understood what I needed. He made the process easy and without any hassle. Also got a rental car service through VW Enterprise. Ingrid is very professional. She's competent and pleasant. Overall, a great 100k service at VW Santa Monica. Thank you!<//review><Rate>5< /Rate>< resp>

Chris Weller was awesome. I showed up at Volkswagen SM to discuss my options, and wound up driving a 2014 Jetta off the lot a few hours later. I've had some terrible experiences with car salespeople in the past, and was about to write them all off as criminals until Chris proved me wrong. I felt like Chris was on my team, fighting off the bad guys with me. Not sure how much of this had to do with the fact that he looked EXACTLY like Kevin from Home Alone, but hey, "I'm not afraid any more! I said I'm not afraid any more! Do you hear me? I'm not afraid any more!"< /Text>

< Review>
My engine light came on, so I visited this volkswagen dealership for the first time last week. Peyman Kahen greeted me at the service station. Peyman was so helpful and such a professional. He broke down all the costs for me and tried to help me minimize the amount I had to spend to fix my car. I dropped my car off at 11AM in the morning, and Peyman helped arrange for me to get a shuttle back home. He later called to update me that my car would be finished the same day! Overall very good experience at this dealership and would definitely recommend asking for Peyman.<//Review>

Peyman Kahen is my regular service manager, and he does a good job. People tend to think that taking your car to the dealership for service is completely overpriced, but Peyman always manages to give me a good price.

There is no comparison for how knowledgeable they are about your VW; it is all that they work on. I continue to bring my car here even though it is out of warranty, and have always been pleased with the results.<//Text>

I was completely taken care of by Odell Hadley.  He was knowledgeable and patient.
Doren  Weil was also with helping me get the rental car that was right for me.
All the people I encountered VW Santa Monica were ready to help, and knew what to do.   Thankyou,< /review>

<review>Worst place! I bought my car here and it has had many problems! Y was driving it and then my breaks stopped working. I brought it to the  Santa Monica dealership and they didn't do anythin for a week and then they told me I had to pay $1500 for a small brakes problem. I didnt fix it there and took it to a small aito shop which cost me $300. They charge you way more for any service and their customer service is terrible<//review>< Pictures>

Took my GTI for yearly service this week and I worked with Peyman Kahen, who was very knowledgeable and helpful. He advised me on what needed to be taken care of right away, and what could wait a little bit, and sent me a detailed inspection report. Although they don't have a rental car representative in-house anymore, Peyman made arrangements for me to get a rental and the process was fast and easy. My car was done the same day (as always) and it is running great!<//Review>

I've very disappointed with this dealership all the way around. From the service department to the new car sales.

On 6/4/16 I come in and meet with Thom (Tom) about my 2009 VW GTI with DSG transmission having a lot of issues. He does a quick 2 second test drive in the service lane and says "yup, your tranny is shot". I go inside and we schedule for me to bring it back on Monday 6/6/16 to drop it off. (I live all the way in Hollywood) Thom informs me my car had the warranty extended by VW due to the faulty transmission.

On 6/6/16 I drop it off and have a friend follow me at 6:30am to bring me back home so I can get ready for work. I call them around 1:30pm to check and see if they had figured out the issue, as Thom told me he'd call me ASAP. He informs me the tranny guy wasn't in today, called in sick and they would look at it tomorrow.

6/7/16 rolls around and he calls and says "when you did your transmission service your people used the wrong fluid, yours is suppose to be gold, not pink. I then tell him I know for a FACT the DSG fluid was used and I had the receipt from VW proving such. He then goes on to say basically that I was lying and to send the receipt.

I send over the receipt and then when he sees I'm not full of it and have paperwork to back up my statements he then says the person that did it before used wrong fluid and there was some left in the tranny. (Why you ask right....I'm getting there). So I had the carfax showing the prior tranny service was done at a VW dealership in Houston, TX. I call them, and the manager pulls the hard copy and looks it up. Again, DSG fluid used, not pink.

Thom tells me then that VW will void the warranty and not replace my tranny if there is any red fluid in it and I have to pay $300 for a tranny flush, or pay close to $4500 for a new tranny. He tried and did anything he could to get $300 out of me, and I know he is full of it.

Now, on 6/10/16 I got sick and tired of waiting on VW to get my car fixed and I submitted a credit app to purchase a brand new GTI from their stealership. Got a call from a Nicole in finance who said she was personally going to handle it all. We spoke a few times that night, and haven't spoke to her sense, even though she SWORE and PROMISED she was going to call me back personally. I've had lender after lender call me, but no Nicole. You call and get her voicemail and leave a message and she still don't call you back.

Today is 6/12/16 and I still don't have my car back. Tomorrow is a WEEK! I've been walking to and from work and taking Uber. You text Thom and you get very short replies. I've spoke to his manager, Willy, and he seems to not give a crap either.

I can say this, I learned a lesson. The lesson....NEVER take your car to these idiots and never purchase from them. They do not car about their customer at all. I don't care who is paying for my new transmission, I'm still a customer and should be treated as such. I will never take a vehicle back to them, nor purchase from them.</Text>

My most recent service was with Thom Painter, a VW veteran but recent Santa Monican, who knows his stuff and has an excellent personability! I've also received outstanding service from Peyman Khan, that dude crushes!!!

< Review>
I purchased my first car, Jetta VW, directly from the owner so this was my first time buying directly from the dealership. The process was very smooth and Mark Shapiro, with Internet Sales, was awesome. Mark is very attentive and enthusiastic about his job, so he takes a very educational approach to sales. I never felt a car was being pushed my way. I finally saw a car that interested me, drove to the dealership and took a black/black cc home the same night. It is now back with VW Santa Monica getting detailed (shop was closed the night I decided to drive it home) and I cannot wait to drive it.

I would definitely come back to VW of Santa Monica for my next purchase.</Review>

<pics>None</pics><Rate>3<//Rate><Text>I took my car in for a maintenance service (thank goodness for those reminders on the dash!)  Roy Halleluyan was my service associate.  I brought my car in at 7:30 to hopefully get my car by the afternoon.  I knew that my tires were probably going to be needing changing along with my brakes.  At 10AM, Roy called to tell me my thoughts were correct.  I agreed to the changes, however didn't get any estimated time of completion.  At 3:30, I called and left a message to Roy to see what the update was on my car.  I decided to go to the dealership since I was securing a ride there.  I show up at 3:45.  I still didn't get a call, however Roy said he was just going to call me.  I waited 2 more hours in the waiting room at VW.  Apparently, there were issues getting me 2 more tires for my car. and they had to wait for delivery.  I wish I would have known this earlier.  This was a little frustrating, I'm sure it wasn't Roy's fault, but a little more communication would have been helpful.  Roy did a good job informing me about the tire sale, but needed to tell me sooner that the tires were not available.
I have been a SM VW customer since my first Jetta 1998 and have been a loyal customer.< /Text>< date>

Had an excellent experience with Volkswagon Santa Monica Service Dept. Peyman Kahen was great in translating the concerns I was having for my EOS to the service Tech who did a fabulous jog in taking care of her.  It is great to know there are service departments still around that provide Customer Service. I would definitely recommend this service department and Peyman Kahen to anyone that has a VW.

<Review>VW SM was very business-like but friendly and welcoming.  Odell Hadley was the service agent who managed the whole process of getting the repairs needed for my aging VW.  We discussed my car's service needs, and he kept me informed in a timely manner as the work was done.    When it became necessary to keep my car overnight, Odell arranged for a rental car, which was paid for by VWSM,.

In sum, the experience was friendly and efficient.  I am confident my car was in good hands at VWSM.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45<//Gmap_id>< resp>

New to Santa Monica, my Little White Jetta was making an odd noise- I called Kyle Lewis at Volkswagen Santa Monica.  Kyle walked through "possibilities" over the phone and then made a reasonable appointment for me to stop in and let him hear my mystery noise.  I logged into Volkswagen of Santa Monica and through "my account" I was able to schedule follow up appointment w/ Kyle and LWJ to be reviewed and assessed further.  Kyle did an excellent job of keeping me in touch with cost and time needed for repairs, as well as the ETA for me to  pick up a now- quite running LWJ.  He was detailed in his description of imminently needed repairs and was efficient when reviewing my bill.   Kyle Lewis was extremely helpful in mapping out a schedule for me to bring LWJ into service department to complete all that the little white Jetta needs in 2015.  I highly recommended calling Kyle Lewis for any service needs for your PV - (personal Volkswagen).</text>

So this was my first time servicing my very first vehicle and I've got to say the service here surpassed my expectations. Debi Callender took care of all my questions and ensured that I got the best price possible. She made sure that she worked around my budget and even told me what to expect during my next service scheduled next year. The only problem was the wait time which probably was because I failed to schedule an appointment in advance. It was a great experience at VW santa monica.</review>

<review>I recently just leased the new Jetta from VW Santa Monica. I had the most pleasurable experience with Hamid Rezaei. He is very professional, personable, genuinely caring, and very patient. With this being my first car, I naturally had a lot of questions and he made sure to walk me through each step to ensure I understood. The entire process only lasted shortly over an hour — it was very smooth and effortless. Hamid has followed up to make sure I'm perfectly happy with my Jetta and never forgets to ask how I'm doing first. He truly made the experience of leasing my first car a treat!</review><user>101444088406857720532<//user>< time>

<Text>It's impossible to describe the most Amazing time in a Car dealership but
I will attempt this with one word,...SATISFACTION...I met a young man by the name of Ashraf Graies that made my experience so comfortable that I want to share it with everyone. He was patient, understanding , supportive and all right giving of himself ,that made my decision to get the Tijuan a complete joy. You have a magicalness about you that kept me calm and comforted about not rushing to have and answer....Thank you for making my experience truth worthy and completely unforgettable. Wish everyone can have a day like this, with you Ash!

PS. Paul thank you for the great conversation.

I bought the car mostly because of Artem. Since the very first moment, he helped me to find the best option and gave me as many alternatives as possible. He knows what he is doing and also, he is kind a and educated so it is very pleasant to work with him.
I have been in many other brands but only Artem understood and worked hard until I found the car that I own today.

I have been going to Santa Monica VW for years and have never encountered any problems.  Everyone is very friendly and helpful. I recently leased a 2013 Jetta and took it in for it's first service this week.  Peyman Kahen is such a wonderful help in the service department.  He is honest, trustworthy, and genuine.  He is very knowledgeable about VW vehicles, reliable, efficient and quick at getting the job done.  Very pleased with the service here and will continue to use Santa Monica VW for all purposes.<//review>

On Friday, April 2015, I got my VW Touareg towed to this location to make a new key. I had bought the truck from an auction company without any key. Given that the truck was a recovered theft insurance vehicle, I knew I had taken a huge risk buying this vehicle. The problem could have easily been a lot more than key issues. Mr. Odell Hadley was my service technician. I was dealing with another technician whom I didn't feel very comfortable with as a first-time customer. After a brief side conversation with Mr. Hadley, he understood what my concerns were. He volunteered to take over my service needs from a service supervisor who was brought into the equation by my first service consultant. Mr. Hadley was very genuine and very professional. He treated me like a friend he cared about. He even offered me a ride back home, which I didn't need as I drove there myself.

On Monday. Mr. Hadly called me and, again, asked me off the bat if I needed a ride to the dealership. I took that as a great sign, because if my truck weren't ready, he would not have offered me a ride there. Excited, I jumped in an Uber car to get there as fast as possible. I was very excited that my Touareg's problem was just key issue. When I arrived, Mr. Hadley told me to go see the cashier. I did and I was absolutely elated to see the total charges on my bill. GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE AT A GREAT PRICE... PRICELESS!! Thank you so much, Odell.<//Review>

<Text>I got two cars from Volkswagen PASSAT ones one for my brother and one for me 2014.
We had a good service with the salesman his name is Arash he is such a nice person and he clearly answered all those questions were in our mind about the offer they had for buying the car under the lease of two years. We are international students and we found this is a really good deal to us. I want to thank Arash the sales man who took care of us and his friend Ashraf and also the manger Billy if you are interested in buying a Volkswagen cars ask for those people I'm sure they will help you out. My experience here in Volkswagen Santa Monica is amazing  I highly recommended. Thanks for you all<//Text>< user_id>

I have a 2013 GTI and had my first annual service at Santa Monica Volkswagen. I was helped by Teagan who was incredibly friendly and eager to help with some questions I had about some minor body damage. I brought my car in on Friday morning and it was busy, but they turned it around very quick. SM VW will definitely be my staple VW dealer moving forward.</Text>

<review>Sean Mollabagher in sales and Julie in the finance office, both did a great job to help me get into a VW as my next car.

Buying a car, like most relationships involves work on BOTH parites. And as most relationships necessitate - a compromise or two. Both parties need to work to make a good relationship. Me as the buyer, I did a ton of research before deciding on the 2015 Golf TDI, and because of the work I put in, it made the whole process easier. Not only did I research the car itself, but went to each individual dealership website to scope out the inventory and asking prices (SM VW had the lowest asking price for my car at the trim level i wanted). Don't get me wrong, Sean M. had a huge part in making sure I got a great deal and was efficient every step of the way. I was less than a minute on the lot and he came out to greet me and my partner. He happily showed us what inventory they had and allowed us to go on a test drive. We then sat down to get to the nitty-gritty. Please, understand they have a job to do and will offer various extended warranties along the way, but neither were overly pushy and always respected my "no" answer and were quick to move on. I walked out a happy owner and a newly VW Golf convert, thanks to Sean M. and Julie, and it only took a few hours (not a whole day of haggling)! Don't expect to get this type of service if you are uninformed or if you don't do your part. No one is going to give you the best deal out of the goodness of their hearts, but these two made the whole process painless!</review><username>Andrew Park< /username>< userid>

When you go to Volkswagen in Santa Monica, you must speak to Mark Shapiro. He is the most professional and most honest salesman I have ever met. I recently traded in my Golf TDI for the Jetta wagon TDI. Mark made the whole experience easy and quick. I love my car!
This vehicle suits my lifestyle, it's awesome on gas and best of all, mark Shapiro made it all possible!< /Text>

Absolutely perfect experience at this dealership. I had an old BMW that the upkeep was killing me on and wanted to find a good certified pre-owned VW. I paid a little more but trusted Vante and how hard he worked. I walked out with exactly what I wanted and was worth the extra to know I got a good car. Highly recommend to all my friends and family. Thank you so much Vante.< /Review>

Took in my car for a scheduled oil change.  It took 30 minutes for them to even talk to us, which is a problem because my ride could not park due to the new santa Monica parking regulations.  After explicitly telling them not to do any work that was extra cost, they rotated my tires and charged me for it, yet didn't have the time to even wipe down or clean anything. Staff doesn't care, you're just another number on the list.  I suggest taking your car anywhere else but this location.</Text>

<Text>I just brought my new GTI in for a quick check-up, and Peyman Kahen came out to meet me 30 MINUTES BEFORE MY SCHEDULED APPOINTMENT. He listened to my neurotic requests, didn't rush me at all, and I never got a hard sell for unnecessary services. A helpful guy with a great attitude.

I pulled out my credit card to pay when I came back in the afternoon, but no need: THE CHECK-UP WAS FREE. Granted, there was nothing wrong with my car, but every time I brought my Honda to the dealer, it took forever to meet with a representative, and they'd almost always come back with an "oh, by the way" charge of some kind.

Not only do I love my new GTI, but so far I'm very impressed with the VW service, and Peyman specifically. Many thanks.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>My service advisor, Kyle Lewis, combined sales savvy and sensitivity to pave the transition and trade-in of my beloved 12-year-old V6 Jetta GLI to a new version of this fun and sporty model. Without being pushy, he asked if I'd be willing to speak with a sales representative.

When Brian DeMoy contacted me shortly thereafter, I was hesitant, but interested. I so loved my Jetta GLI with its sports package and leather interior, but Brian addressed my concerns and skepticism with salient facts and clear explanations, particularly in regard to my dim view of  4-cylinder turbos: "There've been a few improvements in the last 12 years," he allayed some of my doubt; enough so that I scheduled a test drive for the following morning. It was then that I learned Brian wasn't just an enthusiastic saleseperson, but a proud and happy owner of his own Jetta GLI, which clearly he knew inside and out, and was probably why Kyle suggested he be the person to call me. Good call!  Brian was great--and tall, which underscored the spaciousness of what's considered a "compact" sedan.

Can't say enough good things about my experience with VW, from service to sales, and I'm now a proud and happy owner of a new Jetta GLI, which I also can't say enough good things about.</Review>< pics>

<review>I called and made an appointment because my GTI was having an issue. Peyman Kahen helped me out. He was very clear and easy to understand about what the issue was with my car. The problem was fixed, along with another issue they found. I need a 40,000 mile service as well as new tires, but am not ready to purchase them. He was not pushy and suggested/got done a tire rotation to give me another 5,000 miles on the ones I have.

I love Santa Monica VW. I've never had anything but an easy time buying, leasing or getting service on my vehicles there. Completely, totally, 100% honestly, I would never go to another car dealership.

I left my car overnight for early morning service. Ivan Montejano called me throughout the day with updates. Ivan and the team identified and fixed the intake manifold malfunction and covered it under warranty. I also got 45 K service done with no hiccups. It also seems that VW SM has brough back the complementary carwash, which is always a great touch. Thanks!<//Text>

I was looking to buy my first car and was very interested in a Golf. I swung by VW Santa Monica and meet with Chris Simpson who was able to get me a test drive right away. Chris was great and very informative. He told me about the VW First Time Buyer program and all the benefits of a VW and I was sold. The whole process from test drive to driving a new Golf home was quick and easy. I am so happy with my brand new car. Thank you Chris and VW Santa Monica.<//Text>

<Text>Leased a VW Jetta a few weeks ago at VW Santa Monica. Paul K in sales is the man! very attentive, and on top of everything. Made the entire process painless and quick.
Test drove a car, filled out the paper work and soon after I was out there with my new car.

Couldn't be happier with my experience. Would recommend to anyone out there looking into a new VW.</Text>< pics>

<Review>I have gotten 4 cars from this dealership. I have always had a great experience here and I bring my cars back here for service, too. The past 2 visits I've gotten my car through internet queries to Jett Richard. She is a PLEASURE to work with in getting a used or new car.

UPDATE: I ended up buying my car before my lease ran out. I worked with Jett & Raufel & a finance gal who's name I am blanking on at the moment. I had a really great experience and I love my "new" car...which was certified and has an A-MAZING warranty. I would buy another car in a heartbeat!

SERVICE REVIEW: I just had a key fob programmed at the dealer. It was very easy to order the key and when I brought it in to be programmed THOM PAINTER was great...I couldn't have been happier with how everything went! :)</Review>< Pics>

I had the pleasure the other day to deal with Ashraf Graies.  What a wonderful individual, along with the entire sales team..  I would also like to mention Roy at the service center, with his wonderful attitude and taking the time to explain everything to me.

I must say this dealership is on point! I would highly recommend VW of Santa Monica to anyone interested in a VW new or used!

I'm enjoying mine!

Thanks Guys!</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I recently received a call from Stefan Kubicki at Volkswagen Santa Monica about turning in my Touareg and leasing a new one.  I had actually been thinking about changing to a Passat and Stefan was extremely helpful to me during the process.  I found him to be courteous, professional, knowledgeable and very friendly.  I showed up at the dealership and within an hour and a half was driving my new Passat off the lot.  The service was great, the attention to my needs was excellent and best of all, I got the car I wanted.  I've been a Volkswagen Santa Monica customer for many years, and this is exactly why.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>Roy Halleluyan was superb!  He made sure that I knew exactly what would be done to my car, how long it would take and informed me the cost breakdown.  I never once felt unsure about what the outcome would be.  Roy Halleluyan even mentioned a few good places to eat in the area while I waited for the service to be completed.  Overall, the experience was excellent, and I highly recommend Santa Monica VW and Roy Halleluyan.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Had the perfect experience at the recent service of our Tiguan at Volkswagen Santa Monica. Our Service Advisor, Roy Halleluyan, was extremely knowledgable and helpful with all of our needs. We got the car back in a timely manner and running beautifully. Roy thoroughly explained everything that would be done at the service appointment and carefully noted any items we wanted brought to VW's attention. When the car was finished, he went over the service report so that we were fully informed. All is well and we are very happy with Roy and VW Santa Monica.<//Review><user_name>Amy Kanter<//user_name><gmapID>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45<//gmapID><Date>1412092739348< /Date>< Resp>

I previously owned a 2005 Jetta, it was about to exceed its warranty, so I wanted to get a new one. My requirements were; a sunroof, bluetooth, and heated seats. Bridget Stennis was so helpful in assisting me find the perfect car! I told her what my budget was, and at the drop of a hat she said it was done! I drove off in my beautiful new 2014 Jetta SE that I am beyond glad I purchased at this location! Thanks Bridget!!!</Review>

I worked with Raufel Muhammad and I've never had a better experience at a car dealership. He was kind, patient, knowledgable, and explained everything until we understood it. He was determined to find me a car in my price range and not pushy like other people at dealerships. From the moment I called him up over the phone, until I drove away with the car, he was constantly in touch with me and working on getting the right car for me. And always with a smile! Ivann worked on the paperwork with us and he was also extremely patient. He didn't rush through the paperwork. He explained everything in layman's terms and took his time going through everything with us. I left the dealership that day feeling really great about the deal we made instead of feeling like it was forced at me. Thank you so much Raufel and Ivann!! I had a wonderful experience! I'm ecstatic with my new VW Jetta and I would absolutely recommend your dealership to anyone looking to get a new car. -Gillian</Review>

Was helped by Vitaliy Konovalov, and I couldn't have had a better experience. I went around to six places, and not only did I get the best treatment from the people here (from the awesome Vitaliy, Paul, and everyone else), but I'm super happy about the deal I got and Vitaliy made sure I left with peace of mind. Car buying/leasing is usually such an annoying and stressful experience but they did a great job.<//Review>

I went in and talked to Arash Roostaei and instantly knew why my buddy had a good experience.  Arash was so straightforward, no pressure or BS, he listened to what I wanted and helped me make the best decision. He actually talked me out of purchasing a more expensive car and leading the one I ended up getting because it was the right deal for me and met all my requirements for a new vehicle.

Buying a car is never an enjoyable experience. Sure, you're excited about the car & can't wait to drive it but the process of getting it is long and tedious and annoying. But, that's the way it is. At VW Santa Monica, the dealer that dealt with us (Wesley Rockett) made that whole process a lot less stressful and I didn't feel pressured much at all by him. He knew I liked the car and was very laid back about making the sale. He wanted to make sure I was comfortable with the price and left us alone to think about his offer. At this point I was about 99% convinced I wanted the car, but I think I just needed to reassure myself by thinking it through. Before Wesley had a chance to come back to us, one of the floor managers (forget his name) came over - very intense & unlike Wesley. Typical car salesman, if you will. He came over to be that "reassurance" I needed, I guess. He said some things I wanted to hear and ultimately we shook hands on an agreed upon deal. Done! I have myself a new car! Phew! So they both leave and a couple minutes later this floor manager comes back and is looking at this piece of paper that has our deal on it and says that this never got officially approved. He tries to go back on the deal and make it a higher monthly rate for me - what?!? You HAVE to be kidding... So I go from being super excited to absolutely pissed. Who comes back to the person buying your car AFTER we shook hands - done deal - and says that they might not be able to get that deal for us? I was luckily with my dad who couldn't believe this was happening. Never before has he ever seen anything like it. The deal was done, we shook hands, why are you coming back to us? He walked away and said he'll "see what he can do" - jerk. Moral of the story - what started off as an ok car-buying experience rapidly changed into a very uncomfortable situation because of this floor manager. We waited there for about an hour after that whole situation to be officially confirmed that the deal is approved. Wesley made sure we felt at ease about it all. He explained that this manager guy is new and he was not happy with how he handled things. And we told him that it almost made us walk out. He sat with us, reassured us it will be the deal we shook on & then watched some football with us while we waited for all the paperwork. Now, I would give Wesley my business again for sure. He's the least slimy car-salesman type I have ever dealt with but they need to do something with that cocky impersonal floor manager. He almost lost our business, who knows how much business he actually lost because of his stupidity. Overall, I'm happy with the car & with Wesley & even with the guy who talked us through all the paperwork (Ivann).< /text>

If you are a busy professional AVOID their sales department at all costs. Both my wife and I have both run businesses so we usually give a lot of leeway.  Nevertheless, worst customer experience I've ever had at a car dealership.  I've worked in acquisitions/sales so I totally get and respect that it isn't an easy job.  Nevertheless, you don't lie over email on deal terms (there is simple proof), have customers take off work (costing them money), and then waste 2.5 hours of customers time negotiating just to quote them your website price. If we are not close on terms, no worries. Everyone go their separate ways.  It seems their sales managers (Kevin? & Vante?) like to play the "get you in the door with any promise game." That is so disrespectful. Great salespeople don't need to lie to get people in the door and actually value customer's time. What is even worse is that they just followed up via email saying that have a "special deal" for us.  Do you think they realized that they should go back to the agreed upon email price or something close?  Nope, the "special price" is the quoted price on their website yet again.  That is the "special deal" they are going to give us - it is like a bad SNL comedy sketch.  To top it all off, there are other area VW dealers with online ads on sites  for less and they refuse to even consider the other deals.  Additionally, I also had a hilarious interaction with the Internet Sales person, Artem Dasov.  I ask him to confirm via email whether or not that had a specific car in stock.  His response, "we have a great selection."  That is nice, but can you check on that specific car for me on the lot before I come in? Not a great internet customer service representative. Do not be baited and switched by the management at this dealership.  They don't respect you as customers or your time. Bought the exact same Passat from another area dealer that beat their best trade in offer by almost $2000 and less monthly payments.  That said, my wife used to have a Jetta and  seemed to like their service department.  Too bad they don't have separate places to review sales and service.< /Text>

Had my vehicle serviced at VW Santa Monica for the 3rd or 4th time. The last 3x Peyman Kahen has taken care of me. Now I will not drop-off my car for service unless I can book an appointment with Peyman. He knows this business and is a genuinely nice guy not looking to take advantage of customers like so many other dealerships out there. Whether you need a small tune-up or major service, Peyman is your man!<//text>

I went into VW Santa Monica after a long day of shopping around at other dealerships.  From the moment Arun greeted me at the door, I had stellar service.  Without much negotiating, my previous best offer was not only meet but was beaten.  Extremely satisfied with my purchase, service, and overall experience. This is my third VW, second from VW Santa Monica.  Highly recommended.</Review>

It was a pleasure working with Artem "Art" Dasov from the Internet Sales Department. He helped me go home with the Toyota Prius that I had been looking for. I typically hate going in to car dealerships but this experience was different. Artem did not rush us or make us feel pressured. He did not try to convince me to purchase a car that I would not be able to afford. He spent approximately an hour with us one evening and a number of hours the following day. He was very friendly, professional and down to earth. The gentleman in the Finance Department (apologies for not recalling his name) was also equally friendly and professional. Great experience!< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>I had problems with my key turning the engine on...so they replaced a part and now it works perfectly.  I am very happy with my service at this agency.

11/17 - I was told that my 2013 Jetta did not need service until the light came or I reached 10,000 miles - not by my service representative, but the people that come out when you drive up.  When I was told my car needed oil, I emailed Jeff and he said to come in on 11/17.  He then informed me that I should have come in after 1 year and since it was almost 18 months, he had them do the 2 yr maintenance.  I have very low mileage - less than 8,000 miles as of today, so was happy to know that the car was then taken good care of.  Jeff is very considerate of this "older driver" and helps me with minor things...like setting the clock...with a smile.  Thanks again, Jeff.<//Review>< pics>

JEFF AND ROY IS A CLOSE SECOND! Peyman makes sure all his customers are treated,and priced fairly, and are totally satisfied  when they depart.
The service team works "together" and never have I seen them "under-cut" one another!
I believe in them and trust them all. I've been leaving there a happy customer for over 8yrs. Thank you Peyman Kahen--Leader of the pack--
best to you all, see you in 5,000 miles!
Keep up the good work Santa Monica Volkswagan

had my second annual service for my Golf 2013. Like every time Peymon Kahen did an excellent job ...he is fantastic ! I since 8 years I had VW cars and every time I wanted Peymon to take care of my cars services and repairs. He is very professional and nice, very patient and he took time to go over various details and things to know... he is  friendly, reasonable and honest .... If you have a VW with issues or just need service or a good oil change, take it to PEYMON<//Review>

Our rep Peyman Kahen is always really helpful in getting the car done quickly and thoroughly. He communicates well, and is always honest about what service is essential. He's friendly and honest. The facilities are great there too. A clean waiting room, friendly staff, free wifi and coffee!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>I have been to VW Santa Monica twice now for major service on my 2008 Jetta. Both experiences have been exceptional. A year ago I went in to have my radiator fans replaced, not a simple or cheap service. The service specialist honored a quote he had provided months prior even though the cost of the parts had jumped significantly in the time between when I received the quote and then came in to have the work done. He also was able to pull a few extra coupons and had the manager approve an additional markdown, saving me several hundred dollars for the entire service. Not only was the customer service exceptional, but the work done was also top quality.

My latest visit to Santa Monica VW was again above and beyond my highest expectations. Sam Momemy was my service rep this time. The minute I pulled in the drive someone was there to greet me and brought Sam out to discuss my service needs and look at my car. My car is over 100K miles and he went through all my questions and explained exactly what it needed at that time, as well as a timeline for when future services should happen to keep my Jetta happy. The quote he gave me for all the services was less than I had anticipated (oil change, transmission, cooling system, etc.) Not only was that a nice surprise, but then at the end of the day when he reviewed all the work they had done (they fixed a few other fairly minor problems they found at no extra charge!!) he took an additional $100 off the quoted price from that morning! What dealership in the world does that?? I've dealt with several sketchy mechanics in the past who always find ways to charge you extra and you never really know how great the quality of the work is. VW Santa Monica has treated me so well and I feel like i get so much more than I ever expect for the money I pay. I will always come back to VW Santa Monica for all my Jetta service needs!! Thanks Sam and team!!< /Text>< pics>

Wow!  VW of Santa Monica is awesome!  I went in looking to get a GTI, thinking that the car was probably out of reach.  Mark Shapiro did an excellent job of answering all my questions and addressing all my concerns.  Never once did he try to push me into anything I didn't want, and he even worked with me on my trade in and my budget.   I love my new GTI and really appreciate the amount of energy the whole team at VW Santa Monica put into making the sale happen on my terms.  Ivann was also amazingly helpful, explaining the financing terms to me and helping me get a better interest rate than the one originally offered.  I'm very happy with my experience at VW Santa Monica and would happily do business with them again. Thanks again guys!<//Review>

As a newcomer to VW brand, I recently leased a 2014 GTI and Vitaliy Konovalov made the entire experience very easy and personable. I never felt pressured or rushed, he took time to explain and show different options and features. In the end, I drove away a happy customer knowing that I got a good deal. I look forward to working with Vitaliy and Volkswagen of Santa Monica for my future car needs.<//Text>

I'm now driving my 2nd Volkswagen - a brand new Passat.  I broke it in this weekend by heading to Vegas.  Santa Monica Volkswagen has superior service and I want to thank everyone for their help in the past and moving forward with my new car.  Thank you Brian Munill for excellent service.  Also thanks to Mike Berger, Vicki, Vonte, Vitale and the guy who drives the Van when your car is in service.  He is always so nice and good spirited!

My oil and check engine light were on my Passat. I have never been to Santa Monica Volkswagen and was nervous because I have an established relationship with Neftin Volkwagen.

Debi Callender at Santa Monica VW along with every other interaction I had with the service department was excellent. The staff are friendly, trustworthy, informative, and just there to provide great customer service.

It's good to know you are always in good hands with any VW service department regardless of where I am.

Great job!< /Text>

Carlos is also very thoughtful and help as well, I has spoke with him before for my last service, and he still remember me and ask I was about to pay my bill he came ove and ask did I need any help..I was just suprise this young man would remember me, and to take the time to come over to see If I was being serve by a staff member at Santa Monica VW meant allots to me, I have been to sereral diffrent car dealerships, but No one compares to the staff at SM Volkwagens.

I took my 2012 Jetta GLI in for a basic flat change.  Peyman Kahen was attentive and timely and went out of his way to go above and beyond (e.g. patching and rotating tires).  I would not hesitate to return when in need of service.< /review>

Overall I had a great experience with VW Santa Monica.  Before stopping here, I had multiple sub-par experiences with at other dealerships, which turned me off to car shopping all together.

The friendly sales rep Arash told me from the beginning that he would be willing to work with me to get me that car that I wanted. They have a huge inventory of cars (it may help to look online first to make sure), so they're bound to have what you want. Although it may have taken awhile to get to the price that I wanted (make sure to know what incentives are available!), in the end we were all satisfied with our sale. I bought a VW Jetta TDI with Premium and Navigation, and could not be happier with my purchase.

Overall, they want to take care of you. I highly recommend this location.</Text>

I have leased and purchased several cars from Santa Monica VW and have consistently come to them for service and repair.  Everyone there that I have dealt with is topnotch.   Bridget Stennis makes sure that you get the right car for your needs and the best possible deal.  I've had excellent service from Jeff Crawford.   And my last two service and repair experiences have been with Peyman Kahen.

Peyman did everything in his power to make sure I got the best possible service at the estimate he gave me.  He kept in constant contact so there were no surprises and explained each step what was being done and the choices I had to make sure my care would be running safely.   I trust him completely and everything was done expertly from large repairs covered by warranty to small issues that I had asked to be fixed.

I would give Peyman and Santa Monica VW 6 stars if it was an option.< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I came in to the Santa Monica VW Dealership for an oil change and to have an under-hood fuse recall taken care of. My Service Advisor was Peyman. From the get-go, Peyman was very polite and accommodating. He asked all of the appropriate questions and actually listened to my answers and concerns, rather than like most, who are just thinking of what he or she is going to say next as they ignore your answer.

Once my vehicle was brought in he came out a short time later and explained was what going to be done to correct the issues I came in for as well as any suggestions he had; i.e. cabin filter replacement, rear brakes, etc. for things to consider taking care of in the future.

The most significant thing I beyond appreciate, is the fact that he did not lie to me stating that  there were all sorts of other 'issues' that were found and needed to be repaired otherwise my car would not run properly after I pulled off the lot.

I put that last section in because I know that it unfortunately happens to A LOT of unsuspecting individuals. My point is that Peyman is honest and straightforward, two of the highest compliments I can give, but don't very often because they are not earned.

Keep up the good work Peyman. Hopefully, with your hard work, excellent customer service skills, and blunt honesty, you'll shoot up that 'corporate' ladder a little sooner and quicker than many others who are not as deserving.

Thanks Peyman and I will look you up for help with my vehicle next time I am at the dealership.

All the Best,

I have owned a number of "high end cars" (mercedes, lexus, etc) and was not expecting the same level of customer care from a VW dealer.  My experience in fact has been as good, equal or better than i have had from any other dealer.  In fact, i sold my XXX (a very highly regarded German car) to buy my Tiguan.  The only thing i can say that one of my reasons for selling was i tired of not getting the kind of service that i now receive from Sta Monica VW.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>When it comes to buying a VW, dude, duuuuuude., Sam hooked me up. He only did a touch of the, "Let me talk to my manager." schtick and got me what I want at the price I wanted. Sales here is really a solid team. As for service...

I like my service advisors. I really do. They're smart, funny, and capable. Sadly, they can't seem to fix my damn car. Parts disappear, techs call in sick, gremlins steal their tools. Make sure the parts on ON SITE before you drop your car off. Don't expect a loaner, either, though the rental counter is handy. The prices are also, well let's say, exuberant. An independent shop may not wash your car when they work on it, but they also won't charge you three times market...

Their drop off is a gosh darn disaster most mornings. Take advantage of the mid week specials and make an appointment! Oh, and the coffee is excellent.

Ashraf Graies and Robert were SO awesome and helpful when I went in to Santa Monica Volkswagon not even looking to buy a new car!!!  They happened to have the pre-owned Eos in the color I wanted and shortly after that with, no pressure and so much help from the guys, I had a new car!!  They are so great and I would absolutely send anyone over to them to get a VW!!!!</Text>

My 2013 Passat was recently totaled. In search of a new car, I went back to VW Santa Monica, where I had originally purchased my Passat from Melvante a.k.a. "Vante". My experience was such a pleasure the first time around that I returned to Vante to purchase my 2014 Jetta.  Everyone, including Vante, is very welcoming and friendly. The managers make it a point to introduce themselves. Always a great experience.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Excellent service and personal compassion.

I was just leaving Inglewood in my 2012 Eos to drive to Big Sur to scatter my brother's ashes when the EPC light came on. I lost power on the 405 before I could get to VW of Santa Monica. Towed in, I was assigned to Debi Callender, the finest service provider and human being imaginable. She ascertained that I had an extended warranty, soothed all my concerns, got the car in for repair (it turned out to be the fuel pump), provided a great Jetta loaner, got the mileage waived for my long trip, hugged me, and sent me on my way feeling cared-for and serene. She checked on me on the road by phone, was supportive and bolstering, and I arrived back 5 days later to a fully repaired and sparkling clean Eos. I was able to attend my brother's memorial, leaving everything in Debi's  capable hands. She is in my heart forever, and I there are no adequate words for the gratitude I feel. I trust Volkswagen of Santa Monica, where I purchased my last two of many Volkswagens, but Debi Callender went way above the usual excellent standard of service.< /text>

This is my 3rd Jetta from VW Santa Monica, and the experience was excellent as always! Moe Aboushaban was the consummate professional--knowledgeable, helpful, & personable. He helped me get exactly what I wanted and needed, and for a great price. And Cy Zamani walked me through all the financial paperwork and details with patience, expertise, and more helpful advice. Moe & Cy went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my new car.  I love this dealership--these two gentleman provided another great experience at Santa Monica VW. Thanks guys!</review>

I had an excellent car shopping experience at VW in Santa Monica. I found my perfect VW GTI in their big selection of new and pre-owned vehicles. The salesperson I worked with, Artem Dasov, was super courteous and professional throughout the entire car buying experience.

<Text>Everyone at Santa Monica VW is outstanding, particularly service writer Peyman Kahen.   I bought my 2003 V6 Passat from Santa Monica VW when the lease expired.  I have had the car serviced exclusively at VW Santa Monica since.    My experience with this dealership and particularly Peyman has been outstanding. I think he and they are honest and knowledgeable.  I am done being ripped off by a different, unnamed non-VW dealership, which has been robbing me for years in servicing (badly) my wife's car.   I now take that car to an independent mechanic, which I should have done years ago.   In contrast, I consistently get extremely good value from Santa Monica VW.   I intend to keep my "looks and runs like new" Passat serviced there for quite awhile to come, until I no longer own the car.

I add Roy Halleluyan as another first rate person at SM VW.   I like dealing with this place.    I think they make an effort to keep their customers.</Text>< Pictures>

I have been getting my VW's serviced at VW Santa Monica for over 15 years. If Auto Service can be painless, VWSM is as close at you can get. Ask for Debi Callender when you make your appointment!<//text>

He truly went above and beyond in helping me with my new car.  Arash is nothing but kind and accommodating, he was not in the slightest way pushy, and truly wanted the best for me.  I highly recommend him and hope you get to enjoy a new VW :)<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

By far the best car buying experience I have ever had! And that is all thanks to Hamid Rezaei at Santa Monica Volkswagen. I was in the market for a new car ...I was interested in the Jetta SportWagen TDI - but I wasn't sure yet about getting a diesel car. I went to several VW dealerships and my experience was OK... then I went to Santa Monica and spent the whole day at the dealership checking out options - I had decided on the Jetta wagon - but couldn't decide on the color. Hamid was AMAZING - so knowledgeable, patient and personable. He brought out several different colors of the wagon and let me test drive them all - to help make my decision. I felt like I was talking with a friend or someone that had my best interest at heart. Truly - such an amazing car buying experience - never experienced anything like it. He even followed up with me a couple days later to see that I was happy and then again the next day to make sure I was able to set up my appointment for tinting the windows. Do yourself a favor and see Hamid Rezaei if you are in the market for a new car! It was such a positive experience. Hamid is the best!!!< /Text>

<review>Me and my twin sister just leaseed two 2013 Jetta Volkswagen from Santa Monica VW from Josh Vafee and Vitaliy. Best experience we ever had and could not be more pleased with our new cars. They worked very hard for us and exceeded our expectations. Not only did they get us a good deal but the process was extremly fast as well.< /review><gmap_id>0x80c2bb4809632b7d:0x557d693672bcbf45<//gmap_id><UserId.>107712455582219373089<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

LIfe's too short and I work too hard to deal with sales staff who are less than enthusiastic, supportive, thorough, responsive, and pleasant, and I basically shared that thought with VW corporate a few months ago when I had a complaint about a different dealership.  They listened attentively and within an hour, I was contacted by VW Santa Monica.  I'm glad that when life handed me lemons-in the form of apathetic VW sales staff in that other dealership, I was able to make lemonade thanks to the courteous and enthusiastic Anton Schuberthan of VW Santa Monica.  He's friendly, knowledgeable, and most of all tenacious!!  He was there for me every step of the way and his focus was on superior customer service.  Third bug's a charm!!!  Thanks to all of the other staff that made my transaction fun, celebratory, and spirited....if you're in the market for a VW, make a point of going to see Anton and the crew in Santa Monica.  I've been to several other VW dealerships-some of which would have been MUCH more convenient for me, but the "sales with a smile" in Santa Monica distinguishes that team from the others. Happy driving!!<//Text>

VW Santa Monica and, in particular, Artem Dasov, were GREAT!  My Honda lease is soon to be up (and I knew I didn't want another Honda - especially from Honda of Santa Monica) so I decided to test drive a VW (Jetta and Beetle).  Both were great, but I fell for the VW Beetle.  Artem was incredibly friendly, courteous and knowledgeable (and not pushy at all - so refreshing).  The other thing I liked was that he was incredibly responsive to my multiple email questions while I was making up my mind (even replying to one email after 9:00 at night!).  When I decided to move ahead (the last day of a great lease special) he got the deal done quickly and at the price quoted (and VW paid the last month of my lease).  Artem had to get the car I wanted from another dealership and it was ready within the timeframe he promised and he did a thorough walk through on all the things I needed to know when I picked up my car.  Paul Park in finance was also helpful and made the $ process as pain-free as possible.  My new car is so great that even my husband, a long-time Mercedes driver, loves it too!  Overall, I would give VW Santa Monica, and especially Artem Dasov, 5*!!  A VERY happy new VW family member.< /review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>My experience at Volkswagen Santa Monica was absolutely fantastic all thanks to Artem Dasov. I would highly recommend anyone in the area looking to buy or lease a car to visit the dealership and speak to Artem straight away. He was incredibly helpful from the moment I arrived and gave excellent advice and a phenomenal service. Everything was easily explained, and I was given a brilliant deal that I just couldn't get anywhere else. Since getting a lease with Volkswagen, Artem has continued to be incredibly helpful and I know if there are any problems Artem and the team will be there to help out, not that there has been any problems at all, it's all been perfect! I couldn't recommend Artem and the rest of the team high enough. Incredibly professional at all times and a wonderfully friendly service too. Don't go anywhere else!< /Review>< pics>

Last weekend my wife and I walked on the VW lot to simply check out the cars, and we ended up purchasing a Passat. We were considering our options as my current lease was up at the end of the month, and we had visited a couple of other dealerships in Santa Monica with the intention of doing light market research.

At the VW dealership, my wife and I met Anton Schuberthan who instantly became more of a trusted friend than a salesperson.  He quickly helped us identify which vehicle was right for us, showed us how it was different from its competitors, clearly explained all of the features, and gave us pricing for leases vs. purchases under multiple different scenarios of our choosing.  Anton was friendly, knowledgeable, thoughtful, and respectful of our time.  More than that, Anton made the end-to-end process incredibly easy and enjoyable, which is something I have rarely experienced.

If you are in Santa Monica and looking for someone to tell you about VW's or help you make a purchase decision I would highly recommend Anton Schuberthan.  The first week with the Passat has been great.< /text>

<Review>As a recent college grad who was very anxious to be leasing her first car, I can safely say that Bridgette "Jett" Richards was truly wonderful in making the process appealing, fun, and informative! I felt very comfortable around Jett and her manager, who helped me get a great deal on a new Jetta S with the college grad program. Even better, she was able to throw in a sunroof for me for no extra cost! It was overall a terrific experience made better by Jett, who connected with me throughout the process and made me feel totally comfortable. If you or a loved one is looking for a new car, do the following: head to Santa Monica VW, ask for Jett, and begin the process!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>5<//Rate><username>Andie Safon</username><Date>1371334311524</Date></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Sales Person -
Bridgette Richard (Jette)

Where do I begin?! From my first call to the moment I got the keys to my beautiful VW Jetta it was nothing but an extreme pleasure to work with this dealership and particularly Ms. Jette! She was single handily the BEST SALES PERSON I have ever met in any sales experience (and I was a sales person myself for years so I know a good one when I see it). My situation was difficult as I am an expat here in the USA who only moved here less than 6 months ago and already had issues trying to get a car with another car broker. She and the team at VW Santa Monica made sure I got the best deal possible, they worked hard to get me the lease term that worked with my visa, made sure I understood everything and Jette threw in the sunroof option for no extra cost (which I really wanted!!).

It was a hassle free experience that was the most pleasant surprise. From all the bad things I’ve heard about dealerships and car sales people I was really skeptical before calling them, but from the moment I spoke to Jette she reassured me everything would be fine and everything was more than just fine. Especially since this was the first time I got a car all on my own I was guided through this process better than I could have ever expected.

The dealership itself is great. Everyone I met there was an absolute delight and they work hard to work with you. I give my highest recommendation for this dealership and more than anyone to Ms Jette! She is seriously the best and I can’t stress enough how much of a DELIGHT she is to work with. She will make you feel special and make this whole experience easy and fun as it possibly can be!!!

I could not be happier that I got my car from Santa Monica VW and more than anything from Jette specifically. If you need a car or looking around, look no further because from everywhere I’ve been this is seriously the best dealership I’ve ever been to and they will treat you like royalty. Make sure you ask for Bridgette “Jette” Richard and be prepared to have the greatest car buying experience EVER!<//Review>< pics>

I recently leased a VW Tiguan from Arash Roostaei and the entire experience was great! He really worked within my budget and got me into the car I wanted at a great price. Arash was courteous, professional, and incredibly knowledgeable about the car. I had tons of questions about both the lease and the car and he answered them all with a smile on his face. Would definitely recommend him and VW Santa Monica to a friend.< /text>

Simply put this dealership service is sub-par.  Went in for an oil change, and came out with a problem with my front left axle that they neglected to tell me about until I asked about the sudden squeaking that was non-existent when I took the car in.</Review>

I stopped by VW Santa Monica yesterday as part of my test driving tour through the city. It was my intention to check out the new Jetta and Juke, and compare them to  several other cars i've been considering: When I arrived at the entrance to the dealership I was greeted by a lovely young woman, Lina Martin, who very naturally took me under her wing with her pleasant smile and easy manner. As I was checking out the different cars, Lina accompanied me like a knowledgeable friend while asking me about my preferences and needs.  It wasn't long before I unexpectedly spotted "my car":  an adorable sunflower yellow New Beetle (2010 preowned).  We took her for a spin around the neighborhood and I was sold.  Did the saleswoman "sell" me?  Not at all.  I don't really know how it happened but I do know that everything fell into place:  the price just right, the financing worked, no pressure, no games.  Lina displays competence, terrific people skills and a sincere appreciation for the customer's having a quality experience.  And me?  I drove away in my sweet sunflower yellow bug with the red flower on the dash and a grin of days gone by
while groovin' with my techie sattelite radio & ipod options.  Thank you, Lina!< /Text>

Hamid Rezaei is the man. He got me out of my Jetta lease actually saved me money by getting me into a used Jetta TDI (gas mileage is exceptional with these Mercedez turbo diesel engines). Oh and VW Santa Monica values their loyal customers. They gave me a 6 year warranty on the vehicle for half what it costs, enough that even my skeptical, lifelong mechanic said, Yeah, that's a good deal. I'd recommend this place to friends looking for a vehicle.</review>

I rarely review business other than restaurants, but I was so impressed with VW Santa Monica I had to throw in my 2 cents.  I'm a new mother and was looking for a new car to replace my 2-door coupe (insert tear).  Anyone who knows me knows I'm not fond of station wagons or mini vans, so I was in search of a nice SUV or SUT to fulfill the duty of a slick-looking mommy mobile.

I gave all my criteria to Melvante Williams, and he immediately knew which direction to point me.  As a new mom, I also don't have extra money laying around.  Melvante listened to my concerns and gave me several options to choose from.  I ended up with a great SUT and I am thoroughly pleased with my purchase.  I have no buyer's remorse as I usually do with big ticket items.  Thank you, thank you, thank you for all your help!!!<//Text>

<Text>I purchased a car back in the spring of 2011 from VW of Santa Monica. By chance I ended up dealing with Vante Williams. He was excellent at showing me cars and at the same time not being pushy like other salesmen. Additionally, the first time I met him, I told him I was only interested in taking a test drive and was not planning to buy a car yet. He had no problems with that and still gave me his full attention. About a month later when I decided I definitely wanted a VW, I made another appointment to meet up with Vante, found a great certified pre-owned car and have been happy since with my purchase. I was very impressed with Vante and took my girlfriend back to him when she was looking to buy a car. Once again, he was great. She was also interested in looking at Toyota to compare cars. At the Toyota dealership we dealt with the “pushy, this car won’t last through the weekend” type of salesman in addition to the fact that she liked how the VW handled more. Needless to say, we both are very happy with our VWs.

In terms of the service department, they seem extremely knowledgeable. I had a clicking noise occur in the car under the steering column. I made an appointment, took it in, and they fixed it the same day. Apparently a relay issue that required taking the steering column apart, replacing the relay, and then putting it all back together. After that, they washed the car without any request from me. Furthermore, the car was still under the pre-owned warranty so there was no charge. For newer models, I think the warranty now requires a co-pay, but during the time of my purchase, this was not the case so I didn’t have to worry about this.

Overall, if you’re planning to buy a VW, a highly recommend Vante at VW Santa Monica.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Mr. Vante Williams is one of the very best sales men that I have ever encountered. He let me take my time in my decision making and didn't pressure me into anything. The Volkswagon CC that he hooked me up with everyone that I encounter loves it and so do my wife and I. We have had it for 3 years so far and are ready to return to Vante and make another deal for another one. If you go to Santa Monica Volkswagon make sure you seek out Vanti to make your deal with. I guarantee you will walk away not only with a car but be very satisified with your decision.

Very Thankful Customers

I have gone to SM VW twice in the past three months, the first time was to assist my cousin in finding a good deal on a Jetta, he had gone to dwtn vw prior and they were not accommodating because he was young. We then went to SM and met Sean Mollabagher, he was so friendly, knowledgeable and attentive from the moment we shook hands I knew he was a great man and the right person to help us. Not only did Sean give us a great deal, he stayed with us throughout the whole buying process to make sure that we left happy. Which we did! This past week my boyfriend was also looking to purchase a new car and I immediately said we are going to see Sean Mollabagher at Santa Monica VW, he is the only person I trust enough to take care of us. So we went down to see Sean, he remembered me immediately and gave us the same great service as he did a few months prior. My boyfriend got his brand new VW and is so thrilled with the car and service at the dealership. I highly recommend Sean Mollabagher to anyone that is looking for a car, go see him, his welcoming smile and knowledge of the programs and vehicles is exemplary. We would not go anywhere else for a VW!< /Review>

<review>Went in - didn't have an appointment.  An engine warning light came on the night before so I just brought it in.  I met Peyman who was very helpful and friendly.  He let me know there was also a VW service notice issued on the car that had to be taken care, then he went over the car with me and showed me how worn the tires were (they've been on for over 50,000 miles).  He gave me a printout of the tires that would be needed and how much it would cost in case I wanted to shop around.  I left the car their and took the shuttle to work.  He later called me to say they had found a slight oil leak and a valve needed replacing but it was covered under the extended warranty.  So I got my initial problem (the warning light) taken care of, the VW service notice taken care of and they fixed the oil leak I didn't know I had.  All for no charge.  Plus they washed the car, which was filthy.<//review>< rating>

Service? Not so much. Just try to call the service department.

Press 0? Get disconnected.

Press 1 for sales and ask the operator.

Ask for service. Wait while it rings, then hangs up.

Try again. More ringing. Get someone in service who can't tell you anything.

Service advisor won't take calls, only emails, but also doesn't reply to email.

Finally, service advisor emailed to say he was just starting the job, as another service advisor told me it was done--for twice the rate they initially quoted me.

And it took six days for one small repair.

Not what I call service.<//text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I always want the Santa Monica VW customer service to come back. They have always gone so far as to explain everything clearly without any hidden agenda or fees. as well as great customer service. In my last maintenance, the repair was quite unexpected and could not be more appropriate. If I were ready to buy again, I wouldn't hesitate to come here.

(Original)
Beti nahi dut Santa Monica VW bezeroarentzako zerbitzua itzultzea. Beti joan dira dena argi eta garbi azaltzen ezkutuko agenda edo tasarik gabe. baita bezeroarentzako arreta bikaina ere. Nire azken mantentze-lanak, konponketa nahiko ustekabea izan da eta ezin izan dute egokiago egon. Berriz erosteko prest banago, ez nuke zalantzarik izango hemen etortzeko.<//Review>< Pictures>
