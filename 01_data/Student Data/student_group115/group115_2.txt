Great experience. The express service point I went to was actually in Chino along Grand St. but that one doesn't appear on google maps for some reason. Theresa who ran that one helped me a ton and saved me money on my shipment as well.<//review>

<Text>My package will be delivered estimate on Monday but when I called and was informed that it would be delayed till next day.
However, it is not important until I called them to pick up at their warehouse so I made the second call to their customer service. The representive told me that I can come and pick up right away. I also asked them do I need and comfirmation from their warehouse or some calls and they said no need to do that.
When I came to their warehouse to pick up, they told me that the package was not ready yet due to the container was still not offloaded so I had to come back next day. That's is the point what totally made me disappointed about their service.
At least, they have to work with their partner before informing any wrong information to their customer. This is really bad and not professional at all.< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating><user_name>dang trung<//user_name>< Gmap_id>

<pics>None< /pics><review>Worst managed company ever, i wish i could give them no stars.  They told me my package would be deliver on a Monday.  I signed up to be notified and no update was sent.  i called they told me delivery day was changed to Thursday.  i took off work and delivery guy rang door bell i ran down stairs and he was driving away, didnt wait for me to answer door.  i called to complain and the person who answered phone said she didn't work at the delivery center and she had no way to call the center.  You work customer support and you can't call you service center "REALLY."  She said all she could do was send an email and hope that someone would read it.  Oh the noticed they put on my door said they would re deliver the next day, no package still.  I could pre sign for it because the crate is worth $8,000.  So i took 3 days off from work to wait for package for no reason, and all they can do for me is say sorry.  They cant even tell me where my package is.  This is not the first time i have tried them and every time same thing.  My last time using them. These people are liers they told me it would be deliver and no package 4 days after they told me it would be deliver.< /review>< gmapID>

They delivered my package to the Amazon Facility it was signed by Jose Munoz and when I talked to the customer service it says it’s impossible to be recover. They advised me to get a refund. How embarrassing it passed the customs clearance and it was delivered to the wrong place and I instructed them that need to be signed by me. But it was signed by Jose Munoz. They told me the value it was $52 which is totally wrong. Why would they say something like that if they didn’t open it. It’s embarrassing because Asian people send it and it passed the customs in Asia and here in USA it will happened like this. Ontario DHL branch really need to be disciplined by DHL director, They ruining the courier names. Wake up DHL fired those employee can't do their job properly. Now my package is missing. They told me Jose Munoz is Amazon Rep, yeah right. I don't stop and just believe of what people says and come up with all kinds of reason. I found that Jose Munoz in >>>>>> and he works with DHL. When I told them I filed complaint to the police the gentleman I was talking to put me on hold for 53 minutes. I’ll update you guys what happened to my package it’s a big box by the way. I am requesting the Director of DHL to look up the services and the Ontario Branch given to the customers. I talked to the customer service yesterday and said they closed my case. I will post on facebook and Instagram and update you guys about this case. Since a friend of mine working on radio station I will pay extra to aired this issue until the Director of DHL helped me find my package.
Note: Don't ever deal with Ontario DHL Branch they are very shady.< /Text>

Less than a star...Really terrible service for Riverside area...if your don't have enough people to cover this area should let customers know or at least send them a text time to delivery so they don't have to wait all day long...have send a lot packages to orange county  ...

If your package is stuck here they are just waiting for you to get frustrated and go pick it up. It's not going to be delivered and customer service won't be of any use. You'll have to go get it yourself. There was a nice lady behind the counter and good security guard out front, but DHL is not a real delivery service.</review>

<text>So far my experience has been absolutely terrible, they told me the package would arrive by the end of Friday a few days ago. After 6:00pm I couldn’t call them since they are closed and they don’t open Saturdays or Sundays! Neither do their Customer Service reps! This place is a joke!!! I seriously will never use this service EVER again! I payed extra money on a website for this JUNK of a service!</text>< GmapID>

IPSY ships through this company still no matter all the complaints, it says to me they don't care about their customers receiving great service. Therefore I'm no longer going to be a customer.

<Text>Appreciated the courteous and professional help over the phone in arranging a different delivery location over to the DHL Express ServicePoint in Ontario, CA. When I went to pick up the big package the counter person offered the carry it out to the car. Fortunitely these old bones could handle the heavy load but glad help was offered in case I needed it. Definitely DHL gets an  A #1 rating from me.</Text>< user>

<rate>4<//rate><review>My experience this Holiday season with the ''big 3" .... UPS continies to leave packages in the damn driveway instead of bringing to the front door, Fed Ex has delivered to the front door..but not at my house and they can't find the package or tell me where it was delivered (Merry Christmas honey!)1, DHL delivered directly to the post office as requested.

Although communication confused me, I was able to call and find out where my package was and it was delivered before Christmas!<//review>< pics>

To sum it all up for DHL: 1) changing delivery instructions means 4-5 days delay; 2) tracking information is unreliable and 4-6 hours late;  3) Out for delivery - in my case somebody look for the driver he's been  on the road for 2 days now. Conclusion: Do not use this service if you are on a time limit. Quick international shipments but when they get to a US distribution facility time stops. For the money you pay the service is shameful.</Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>I have called in earlier, as my package was schedule for delivery yesterday. Unfortunately, it is NOT arrived and when i called to track the package the agent has informed me that it is at Ontario location. i then called to Ontario and ask for the status. The agent says is reading off whatever i can track on the internet. I informed her the urgency of this package and i need help on this, perhaps to let me know which facility the package is currently locate at so i can go pick up. and she replied me with "well it is not here. i cannot make it appear." No one is asking her to make it appear, i am asking where can i pick up? how hard is it?

I liked nothing from these people. A package was suppose to be delivered Thursday had a status of delivered and was not delivered. So I called the following day to inform them. I talked to a man around 10:45 and he said I will contact the driver and give you a call back. 2:10 I give them a call back with my concerns and a woman answers the phone. She said our supervisors are not in at the moment so they could not help me and the driver must be at lunch. They can't get ahold of him. So 10:45-2:10 drivers are at lunch. I believe these people stole my package and are all lies. Today Saturday I called not realizing they are closed remind you no one has called me. The man had the nerve to say did you check the property as if I leave trash in my yard for two days and missed a package.< /Review>

This is the worst nightmare I have ever encountered.
We shipped 2 boxes important cargos to Hong Kong in March 15 without any phone call nor email from DHL to us nor our customer they just returned to our shop 2 weeks later, after so many complains they just denied, called sales Rep and email them numerous times they never call back, they just want money
Worst company I ever seen in my life we will never use DHL again at same time we requested all our supplier and customers don't use DHL any more
Tried to give them "0" star but it won't let me
Really pits off customer<//review>

Always friendly when I need to pass by and pick up a package because no one is at home. DHL lets you determine how or where to deliver your package, love that and the service is lightning fast.< /Review>

Called for a time change to drop my package off and the driver was 3 1/2 hours early so I missed him on a Friday. A signature is required so I get a text message at 9am on Monday hat my package will be delivered by end of day Monday. So I sit at home from 9am till I finally call at 6pm to find out where my package is. The call center gave me no information other than it was loaded on the truck and then unloaded. I never received a text or any notification that my package was sitting at Ontario and not being delivered to me. The manager at the call center was not help at all and I demanded my package be the first one dropped off in the morning and he could not even do that. I would avoid this company at all cost because the customer is not first for them. I would give less starts but it wont let me.< /text>

Dreadful.  Worse than USPS.  They deliver from 10am to 5pm on weekdays  (when 8 - 5 people are at work ) then they close on weekends. Great! No wonder they ran out of business in USA.</Review>

My package was not delivered to me. I saw on the website that it arrived to Ontario on Dec 1, and I waited for the delivery. Two days ago, the status was updated to show that on Dec 1, it was delivered and signed by a person whose name does not match anyone in our household or immediate neighborhood. I called their customer service and launched an investigation, and according to investigator Roxanne, the driver "does not remember" where the package was delivered. I am pursuing all possible avenues for complaining about being defrauded of my package.</text>

<Review>Negative 5! Worst delivery company ever. My package was supposed to be delivered on December 13th but when I track my order the shipment was still at the LA Customs & was released on December 14th early morning. The package arrived at Ontario DHL same day but for unknown reason was on hold for another day (maybe they don't have enough packages to deliver, and they don't want to pay the contractor just for few packages to deliver). December 15th it was out for delivery & somebody was at home waiting for the delivery but DHL didn't show up. Next day we checked online & it states delivered, where the hell is our package DHL! I'm sure you know what happened next. Of course I called DHL and today (December 16th) they are still figuring out what happened to my package. Based on my conversation with DHL it was a contractor who delivered the package. For me that means DHL has no capability to service door to door, not like UPS & FedEx. They even called left a message that somebody should be at home because it might need a signature, they're just wasting somebody's time!< /Review>< Gmap_id>

Zero stars. Worst shipment service I ever came across. I order something on the amazon and I am not even aware amazon picked DHL for this. I get an update from amazon that the shipment is out for "delivery today" at 7AM in the morning. I wait all day at home and nothing comes. At 8PM I get another message, "delivery attempted but failed to deliver". I am surprised as I am waiting all day. No one even called me. And this is a Friday. DHL is closed saturday and sunday. I call amazon and amazon gets DHL on the phone and they say "you are in a gated community, your gates were closed, so the driver left". The hilarious part is the gates are always closed. The driver or dispatcher needs to let me know that someone is at the gate so I can let them in. They are going to do the samething come Monday, because the gates are always closed. I call the DHL office on Monday to explain the story and they say "we don't give cell phones to our drivers, some people wait outside their gates to receive shipments" and that it is upto me to hunt down who the carrier company is, where they are coming from and plead with them to get my shipment delivered at the right place. As a delivery company, they assume no responsibility of actually making sure the shipment is delivered right. I spent three hours on the phone with them. They don't have a clue about customer service or shipping to residences. They are so much a freight company (I guess) they should NOT do residential service. I lost two days of work because of DHL!</text>

I bought tires at Costco and was told to get a four wheel wheel alignment done or my tire warranty would be void if I didn't.  My mechanic recommended Kim's tire and gave me their number. I called, scheduled an appointment for a convenient time. Arrived at Kim's tire on time was told it would be 45 minutes, got a call in 25 minutes that the alignment was completed. Price was very reasonable as it was less than I paid for a wheel alignment a couple of years ago when I bought tires at the place that sold me the tires. James was great, took time to explain that the car was way out of alignment and what was done to correct the problem. Immediately on driving away I noticed a huge difference in the way the car handled.  It handled so much better I was amazed! A bonus is that a few weeks later I noticed a 3 mpg improvement in trip computer. Five stars plus!<//review>

Kim's Tire & Automotive is the best value I have found in the Bay Area for tire work. His team can handle high-end rims and performance tires. I have been to many places, and I'll drive past a number of those to get to Kim's.<//Review>

I called a few places. They all wanted a crazy amount of money to remove tires from wheels. The wheels were not mounted to a car. The tires were flat. Kim's charged me under $40 total. And did it in under 10 minutes!!! Thank you for fair prices and quick service!< /text>

<review>This store is outstanding. I was driving and got a nail stuck in my tire. I called 3 stores and each one denied me, but Kim’s Tire Outlet approved of me right way 30 minutes before closing time. They were finished within those 30 minutes!!!<//review>< Pictures>

This place is GREAT! When installing my tires they noticed that my back rim had 2 hidden cracks on the inside, so they took pics to show me and told me that when I found a replacement rim to come back and they'd remount my new tire from the old rim to the new replacement. When the new rim arrived 2 weeks later, I went down to have my tire remounted and they did it a No Charge! Wow! Now THAT'S Customer Service!<//Review>

<review>They were booked up for this morning, but I mentioned that I wanted the tires rotated before my son left for a trip that would take it over the mileage limit.  They worked me in around 10:00 a.m. and completed the work in about 20 minutes. They are consistently courteous and professional.<//review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808e31f2cf56c033:0x9e1f51e3a4ab0573<//GmapID></record>

I've been to Kim's a number of times.  Service IS great.  Kim is very responsive and hard working.  Tire prices are good and the will rotate the tires free every six months and do a low cost ($80) wheel alignment every year to extend the life of the tires.

Highly recommended.< /review>

<review>Ordered a new tire Friday afternoon and got it in Monday morning, the service is super excellent!

As for the price, Costco website shows $268 for exactly the same tire; dealers website shows $220, while Kim's charged me $175, all prices include installation.

I will definitely come back whenever I have tire problem!</review>< user>

<text>Quick service. Went in with tire emergency after a quick call to see if they could fit me in. Waited about an hour for estimate. They could not repair tire. Put spare on for me. Ordered me a new tire to be replaced the next day. Didn't charge for spare to be put on since I bought new tire to be replaced the next day.  Called when tire was ready next day and had it on and me out the door in about 20mins. Got warranty. They were very nice. No crazy upsell or scary sudden realizations about the car that needed immediate remedy which I've found with some places. I seen him interact with other customers and he was the same. Easy going.  Kim seemed like a genuine guy who knows his stuff. Nothing more or less. Small place and parking isn't easy but service is great.< /text><Time>1541274651969<//Time><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

I've gone to Kim's tires 3 times now. They've been great.
I've gone to other tire shops in the Bay Area, the service was from average to poor.
The guys at Kim's are organized, on time and have provided excellent service each time.
I've had rims replaced as well as tires. Would def recommend and return.< /Review>

<text>I guess i get what i paid for. Bought 2 used tires but one had a minor air leak. They said my old tires weren't any good so i let them dispose 'em for a fee. Then i went there the next day and saw my old tires for sale right in front of the door!! Shady business. If you bought a pair of v12 evo's, those were mine and one also had a minor air leak.< /text>< Resp>

<Review>I don't know about the guy who bought a used tire and expected something unrealistic........I Bought 4 used itres for my wifes 2007 Honda Accord and they are better than the factor set. The ride is better and the handeling is better. James and Luis we great. I dropped off the car at lunch and it was ready when I finished.

They do have new tires as well!!! Lots and Lots of brands. Great shop!< /Review>< pictures>

I loveddd this place. I’ve been recently obsessed with the pintrest minimalist nails and I was not let down. I showed the nail tech a photo and it was an exact replica. I’m impressed with the color and acrylic selection</Text>

Kay did an awesome job on my pedicure! I am so happy that we got the recommendation for this nail/pedispa. Overall everyone did great on myself, my mother and niece. I will definitely recommend this place to friends and family and I recommend it for you reading this review! You won't be disappointed.< /text>

<text>I got a spa pedicure and a dip powder manicure. Service was fast and reasonably priced, however I left with color all over my fingers and powder under my nails, which has not been the case at other salons. Really wish they would have cleaned up my nails a little bit, but overall they turned out pretty good.</text>< pictures>

Covid-safe, they figured out how to make things cool early on. I'm a guy that keeps toenails short for athletic reasons. I have a couple of blackened ones my operator saved. Very skillful!</Review>

Plenty a space provided outside for social distancing. I was very impressed with the setup of the outdoor salon. I would give my rating 10 Stars if I could. it was my first visit and I was very happy with my pedicure. "Ask for Lily"<//text>

<username>Camille Davenport< /username><Date>1530073880494<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><text>I'm not a big Yelper but the people at Olivia's Nail salon went so far above and beyond the call of duty this weekend I can't stop singing their praises to anyone who will listen. My daughter's Girl Scout troop worked really hard selling cookies this year and earned a decent amount of money for our troop. The girls voted several months ago to donate half of their earnings to an animal shelter and spend the other half on an end-of-the-year spa party for themselves. We hired a company to come to my house and provide a whole over-the-top spa experience for the girls. Long story not so short, the company called 20 minutes after they were supposed to be here and said they weren't coming (which is a whole other Yelp review).  We were left with 11 SEVEN AND EIGHT year olds all standing around waiting for the party and absolutely no backup plan. One of the other moms called Olivia's and they told us to come right away and they would be able to accommodate us. I was skeptical because we had a lot of girls, it was in the middle of the day on a Saturday and I assumed it was going to be a lot of waiting around and trying to keep the girls under control while they waited for their turn or waited for their friends to be done or whatever. Our experience was nothing short of phenomenal. They were able to take all the girls at one time, with each girl getting their own chair.  The logistics were perfect and the girls were so happy. But above everything else what impressed me the most, and what I continue to think about two days later, is how every employee was SO KIND and ACCOMMODATING and PATIENT and FRIENDLY. We basically took over the store and each girl had a multitude of requests with lots of different colors and designs on their nails.  Every request was met, each time with a smile. They even gave the girls juice and gave the parents water.
They say kindness goes a long way and I will never forget the kindness we were shown at Olivia's Nails on Saturday.< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOFVenrZJ3HiC-bK61jOvgtW2r4_i4U6SyXFZau=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKCzGbBk5lJXc1lF2Y_XnVw6sQHDXOY7KPD-vG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Friendly front staff,  nicely decorated,  large polish, gel and acrylic options.  I follow My wherever she goes so I'm glad she is here.   She is the best! So friendly and awesome at what she does. She's done gel, acrylic and dip on my nails and she is good at them all. I've also had Linda for my pedicure before. She gives great pedicures.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The pedicure itself was good but the service was less than satisfactory. After spending spending $200 (4 pedicures) plus 20% tip for each manicurist I asked the lady if she could please remove my nail polish which was only 6 nails left and she wanted to charge me an EXTRA $5.
I find that offensive and poor service! I got my nails done here and would have gotten the done again if she could have kindly removed the polish.</text>

I have gone to Olivia's several times and always have had a great experience. Today I took my daughter and we both got pedicures. The lady that did mine seemed to have forgotten to put top coat on mine as the guy who did my daughter's as well. When I was top coating my own toes at home I noticed she had painted on my skin on my last 2 toes on each foot. My daughter's bog toes with nail art is half off her one toe. I don't think I would ever go back there. Paying 70.00 for 2 pedicures you would think it would have been done right.</Text>

< Review>
I don't usually take the time to write reviews, but this time I had to. I'd been to this salon before it was Olivia's so I know what it looked like inside and the renovations they have done are beautiful. From the new flooring, to the pretty lighting and chandeliers, the décor and the furniture, I love the new set up. The stations are more like booths so the experience is more enjoyable and comfortable. All of the staff was very friendly and my appointment was right on time, no waiting. The salon is very clean and very well organized. Natalie did my dip powder gel on my nails and it was exactly was I asked for. Her service was very quick and she did a great job. I didn't feel rushed out of there like at other places. I will definitely be back.</Review>

The receptionist at the front can be extremely rude at times she's polite to some customers but for the most part she is unprofessional and when I cross the road yes I did. Canon customer service for over 25 years and this young ladies demeanor is causing  customers ti walk out of the door which means that money is walking out of the door.  I highly and strongly hope that the owner reads this review.< /Text>

It was my first visit. I was pleasantly surprised when I walked in. The setting is nice and inviting. I love that there's a lot of space. The lady who did my pedicure was nice but I was a little thrown off my her massage technique. It was a little more expensive than I normally pay. I will go back but probably won't be replacing my regular salon.</review>

< Review>
If there was a zero star option I would rather choose it. I got supposedly Bio gel (I have had it other places and this WAS NOT BIO GEL) My tech was on the rude side. She didn't speak at ALL the entire time. And worst of all. My nails chipped 3 days after and COMPLETELY peeled off (which true Bio Gel does not do) within a week!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NEVER COMING BACK HERE. THIS IS BY FAR NOT THE BEST PLACE IN TOWN!</Review>

I've been trying to find a nail salon in the area and have tried a few and have been disappointed. Ever since my normal lady retired it was hard for me to find a replacement for her.

But yesterday after Tiffany worked on my nails i loved it! She's the best and it's amazing. I can't help showing it off to my friends. I can't wait to go get my nails done again.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I love this place, super clean super friendly. However I got this lady Jennifer, I asked for a manicure then the SNS dip powder. She completely blew off my manicure and went straight to the dip powder. I've been trying to grow out my natural nails and I simply wanted that on top. She began filing them down completely too short and I told her to leave them how they were I didn't want them shorter.. and she ignored me and her filing was so crooked. So if my nails were crooked of course when she was applying the powder you can tell they were!! Now my nails are super short and crooked and I am so unhappy with them. Don't get Jennifer .< /review>

<text>Love love love this place! From the modern decor and set up where the pedi chairs and mani/nail stations are separate from each other, inviting and very pleasing aesthetics.

Tiffany is my nail tech and she's amazing doing my dip gel whether with tips or my own real nails. My hands look amazing when she's down with my nails.

I've had Kim and Vee do my pedicure and I am so picky with my ingrown toenails, I need my pedicure techs to be doctors. They've both done a wonders with my ingrown toenails and make my feet look extra pretty.

Highly recommend this place!< /text>< Pics>

In all categories, this vendor scored 5 stars for me. My request was promptly addressed via a Yelp (and email) message with a quick site estimate follow up. As far as the job itself - fast and professional. The technician actually did more than he should have ensuring the highest quality of the overall result. Their price was very competitive - one of the lowest of the companies also asked estimates from. Thank you.<//Review>

I had them help fix microwave and washer/dryer issues before. They were responsive, prompt and good. Today has them install new water heater and furnace. They always seem to do a good job, work patiently with me on making adjustments as needed and  are generally good with quality and value for money.<//text>

Really impressed. I've utilized about 5 different plumbing companies (couple of big names and a few small ones) and this vendor was by far the best. I submitted a request through Yelp and had an appointment confirmation within an hour as well as an estimate. The technician was very efficient and professional. He came out and assessed what parts were needed and provided an updated quote as I ended up expanding the scope once he was there. He came back the next day to do all the work (dishwasher and garbage disposal installation) with no issues. This will be my go to vendor going forward.<//Review>

Kostas was very professional and right on time for both appointments. They give a 2 hour window, and he was on the front end, which is really helpful.
Prices are fair and they don’t require upfront payment before the work is completed.
Communication is very prompt and I received real time updates as the technician was en route.
Overall, excellent.< /Text>

Everything went great except communication. The installers would leave at not return for a few hours at a time (once at noon till 2:45 then again from 4:00 to 5:30.) A heads-up would have been nice. Finished in 1-day but could have finished in 1/2 day if dedicated to just my job.< /Text>

The technician was prompt and professional. He explained what was going on with the ice maker and got it working again. Took A pic  the part # In case the problem repeats. If in a week it goes down he can order the part and service call cost can be applied to the purchase/installation.
This company is very efficient and kept me well informed about when the tech would arrive. I would definitely return for service if needed. 👍🏼<//Review>

Refrigerator was suddenly warm, and we needed it working for the office staff.  Only local repair place that responded to a quote request via Yelp that worked on Daewoo’s.  Fuse gave us a same day hour long window for the tech to show up, and he was right on time.  He replaced the compressor and got it running all at the same day appointment for a reasonable price.

<review>I was not getting cold air. Leo came 20 mins late. but he was super friendly and good at his work. Explained all the procedures he was performing and his observations.   the issue was with bad capacitor. he came back next day with part and fixed it. I already recommended Fuse to my friends with similar issue.<//review>< pictures>

<userid>104365439541390641486< /userid><review>I contacted Fuse HVAC late on a Saturday afternoon when I confirmed that our 2 year old Bryant A/C unit was no longer blowing cold air (on an 82 degree day). I was very nervous as I have a small baby and she was clearly uncomfortable in the heat. They scheduled Arthur to come between 4-6pm and then called to let me know he would arrive at 6pm. He was right on time and got straight to work. Within about 10 minutes, he located a blown fuse, replaced it and checked out the unit in detail. The problem was resolved in less than 30 minutes for $165. We will definitely contact them for any HVAC issue in the future. Thanks Fuse and Arthur!</review>< time>

Fuse HVAC was able to find the problem.  Tried three different approaches and zeroed in  on the problem and fixed our refrigerator.
Thank you Kastas for being persistent.
A thermostat that's acting up intermittently is a tricky problem to find and solve.
We recommend Fuse HVAC: 5 Star Service!!< /Review>

Their response was prompt, only took 20 minutes to set the appointment, after I reached out by text message. Their technician, Chirril, was very professional and on time. He checked the washer and took the time to explain to me what the problem was, what to do in the future if the same thing happens, and answered all my questions. Most importantly, fixed the issue. I was very happy with the quality of service from Fuse HVAC and would recommend them with no hesitation.</review>< Pictures>

<user_name>Eric Simenel<//user_name><Time>1591035023852</Time><rate>5<//rate><Text>On Sunday May 24, 2020, our A/C suddenly stopped after running for 30 minutes and I wasn't able to restart after many tries, and the next day, Monday Memorial Day, the temperature was supposed to go to 100.

I eventually resolved to call A/C Repair shops, looking on Yelp, around 6:30pm.

Of course, on a Sunday evening, not many shops are opened and the few that were could not send anyone before Tuesday.

Only Fuse HVAC told me to try to call again on Monday morning to check for technician availability.

I did call them in the morning, and Chirill, their technician could come around 4pm.

Chirill actually arrived a bit after 3pm and, due to the current Shelter-In-Place, that was not a problem...

He quickly confirmed that it was actually the switch box that had a short-circuit because some animal or insect had been building a nest in between the live and neutral wires, and the inside of the box actually melted...

He was not sure he had a replacement box available but promised to do his best.

Around 5:30pm that day, I got a call from Fuse HVAC that he could come repair if I was ready, and of course I was because it was beginning to be really hot in the house...

He arrived shortly after, and after replacing the switch box, the A/C started as usual.

Thank you Chirill, and thank you Fuse HVAC for being open on Memorial Day!</Text>< pics>

From start to finish, Fuse HVAC was very professional. I found them on Yelp and when I messaged multiple companies they were the most responsive and understanding. During one of the hottest weeks of this year, our AC decided to stop working. After calling 2 other competitors, Fuse was able to schedule an appointment to come out at the end of the week.

My home is fairly new and less than 2 years old. I would’ve expected the builder to install parts and contracted good workmanship that lasted at least 5 years before breaking. We’ve always had HVAC issues even during our first months walkthroughs due to warranty and when the one year warranty expired, things started to break. Bandaids are never a good sign.

Before the repair tech came for the scheduled diagnosis, a text and email arrived letting me know who was coming and when he would arrive. Day of the appointment, Kostas arrived on time and brought face mask with shoe covers. I gave him a run down of what I think was happening, let him in to my attic where the HVAC system was located and he did his thing. After a couple minutes upstairs and checking my outdoor condenser, he pinpointed my Freon was all gone. His team sent me an estimate for the job via email and I promptly accepted. He filled the condenser Freon and added a stop leak fluid in case there was a micro crack in the tubing. He also diagnosed my HVAC zone control box malfunctioned so I needed a new part which had to be scheduled for another visit while they ordered the part. I accepted the second estimate for repair. With all my initial complaints about my AC system, Kostas addressed and fixed my issues. My second appointment will be continued on another follow up review.

All in all, my first impression of Fuse HVAC was great. I recommend this company to diagnose any HVAC related issues. Professional, on-time, quick to fix, affordable, and dependable. They warranty labor for 6 months. Parts are warrantied for 6 or 12 months depending on the type installed. I’ll definitely keep their contact information in my speed dial for other HVAC related issues and problems. A good HVAC company is hard to find that’s reliable and professional.< /text>

Nick came out on a Sunday exactly at the beginning of the 2-hour window.  He found the problem with our oven controller, a bad relay.  He took the board with him to repair at their site and I thought it would probably take a week to get the part and then replace it, but he was back on Tuesday and finished the job.  Very smooth process.</Text>

I called Fuse HVAC and Appliance Repair in the afternoon, didn't have much hope that they could come and fix it soon.  My call was picked up within seconds, and Lilian scheduled a house call for the same day.  Chirill came one hour ahead of time, pinpoint the problem, unfortunately he didn't have all the parts needed. He promised to call around, find the part and come back the next day, and he did.  He arrived at 10:30 am, fixed the issue within 10 minutes.  This whole process with Fuse and their technician Chirill is very positive, especially at this difficult time.  We are really appreciate the punctuality and genuine care they showed to us.< /Review><user>108392230967900123508<//user><time>1584558351557< /time>< name>

Kostas first came to diagnose our ice maker’s problem. He was very clear in stating the problem. Later he came back to fix the problem. He did a great job. Now our icemaker is working perfectly.<//review>

Chirill Z was very professional and patient. He diagnosed and explained everything to us. Our control board has gone bad and advised us to buy a new refrigerator instead of spending a large amount in repairing it.<//Review>

<review>Recently my Maytag refrigerator start making loud clicking noises every five minute or so and eventually stop working. I had a lot of food which could spoiled so I needed someone who can immediately come to my house and fix the refrigerator. I called Fuse and they were able to set an appointment within 2 hours. Technician Sergey arrived on-time and quickly diagnose the issue related with the bad relay. He changed the relay and also clean the fan and air-duct behind the refrigerator which was clogging the airflow. Now my refrigerator is back to normal and I had no issue so far. They also gave six-month warranty of their work just in case if this break again. Sergey was very polite, professional and knowledgeable.<//review><GmapID>0x808e333a02d55d8d:0xd8516be3bec4a5a9<//GmapID><response>{'time': 1583580802447, 'text': '😃Wow, we just love hearing this kind of experience from our customers!

<Review>Had a great experience all around. Our host was very friendly and positive. We went for my Father's 80th Birthday. They had a sign up to celebrate with us and acknowledge my Father's Birthday. The escape room was great and challenging enough for our family team and was a fun experience. Thanks to the Trap Zone for making our celebration day really great for the family. Loved it<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM04Ixas5iUxwIn3CVSKSFDiPwCvXh4ZVpJQ2M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Our experience at Trap Zone was a good one, there is currently only one room available but it has many pros. The room was not too challenging but had a couple tough bits. The highlight was a few interactive moments which gave us a few scares. In no way were these a terrifying experience but it added a little bit of tension which made it really fun.

Solid 4 stars, for me there was still something missing to make this a 5 star experience but overall very fun.< /text><user_id>114615035888604505028</user_id>< Pics>

Fun and challenging game! Our group was made up of two different parties, but our host Allen did an awesome job of getting us acquainted and comfortable with each other before starting. He was friendly and patient and really set us up for success before we even went in. The room itself was definitely a challenge. The atmosphere was creepy and had us all on edge, which was exactly what we wanted. It was super engaging and I'd definitely recommend it to my other escape room loving friends<//text>

My first time at an escape room. I went with family and friends for a birthday celebration and we had a blast! Our group of 8 ranged in age from 21 years to 50 years old and it was also a first time for everyone else, but was liked by all in our group equally. The co-owner/host was great. Highly recommend!< /Review>

<Text>Had a great time! Went with family (4 girls & 2 guys) glad the girls were there. We had to work as a team, control and use your communication skills and you will be fine. Enclosed rooms. Get the clues to to solve hints to move to the next. Not a dark place, not a Holloweenish place. Again, we had a lot of fun.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dcdf1bb302245d:0xfe390cfb90c1d5c2< /gmap_id></record>

Had a great time. We went as a group of 6 with variable ages (youngest 13).  The young woman who worked there was very nice and made sure we had a great time. Takes a lot of quick thinking and working together.  Would definitely recommend; we are definitely planning on going again.<//Review>

<review>What a great time. First time doing an escape room and it did not disappoint.

The folks there were extremely generous, as our group accidentally booked the wrong day they stayed open for us to complete it.

The first clue is getting to the actual building though, the room looks like it is part of a condo complex. you'll have to go to the E building and the top floor to your right you'll see a sign for TrapZone.

I'm hooked and will probably start trying more of these in the future .</review>< GmapID>

This place was awesome! Very challenging but the guy that runs it is very kind and very helpful. Room is a little scary so if your not into that then it's not for you. Awesome puzzles and different types of locks you have to get through. Definitely would recommend. 10/10< /review>

<Review>What an AWESOME find in Orange County! Was referred to this escape room by a friend. Can't thank her enough for introducing my friends and I to this wonderful, challenging, & fun escape room.

The room is located by the lab in Costa Mesa on Bristol & the 73 fwy. When you arrive in the business plaza, the entrance of the business is located in the back, in an upstairs unit. Little difficult to find so I hope these directions help.

Our group arrived a little bit earlier as recommended. We were greeted by the owner and gracious host Allen. He went above and beyond to make sure our group felt welcomed. He explained all the rules and really got us excited about the game. He even let us start our game a little later as my friends and I were enjoying an intense game of Cards Against Humanity he had in the waiting room Hahaha.

When we were done with the game (beat it with 30 seconds to spare), the owner took pictures and even recommended some other rooms for us to try in the area. Overall my friends and I has a wonderful experience and shared a great memory here. I'm definitely going to be an escape room addict now and cant wait to try this place again when they update the rooms and other escape rooms in Orange & LA county.

Try this place out! You won't regret it GUARANTEED :)</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDY3XOXDybcnb5SEEf4UVRWvqs-h-yOIbivDgL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80dcdf1bb302245d:0xfe390cfb90c1d5c2</Gmap_id></record>

No Spoilers, just wanted to say great room. Previous experience not required but highly recommended. When doing escape rooms, it helps to have more people who can communicate together but think in different ways.   This was my 4th escape room and easily my favorite. Wish I could get selective amnesia and do it again...</text>

I really enjoyed the Asylum at TrapZone. My group has done many escape rooms, and this would definitely be on my list of rooms to check out. The difficulty is fairly high, the decor and style match show that detail is paid attention to, and the puzzles are well done with some unique ones.</Review>

<review>TrapZone was my 2nd escape room. I had a great time with the group I went with. The puzzles required a lot of cooperation and communication. The directions were clear and the hints when we needed them were great. Was a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon.</review>< Resp>

The employees at this Carl’s Jr. have always been very friendly and professional. I work near by so I go to their drive through  quite often. Every single time, my order is ready quickly and very good. Huge thanks to Luis for always being such and good worker and everyone else at this location. Many people write reviews based off of single experiences but I can say after eating probably a couple dozen burgers here, that I am overall very happy!<//Text>

Meh- Aint got nobody in the place, less than half the things to do the employees normally would- you would think they would just be focused on making the food well, instead I get a Frankenstein of a slopped together chicken sandwich that was in 3 pieces before I put my hands on it.< /Text>

All I want is to drive thru sometimes but more often than not the parking lot and entrances and actual drive thru menu is surrounded by men just standing around or sleeping. Also make sure to check your bag before leaving, I ordered 4 sandwiches and pulled out with 2. Im not doing 1 star because I should have known better than to pull out without checking.<//Review>

When I asked questions, she didn't hesitate, or stumble over her answers. Food was what I ordered, hot, tasted good. Prices are getting a bit high though, approaching 9 bucks for a 'specialty' burger? Geez, I remember when you only paid that at a decent pub, or 'sit-down' restaurant.

Just tried the new  BFC Angus Thick Burger at Carl's Jr.  I have to say it was pretty good. Of course, I love cheese so I had to check it out. It comes with Sante Fe sauce, lettuce, tomato, and the fried cheese patty. I ordered mine with Mayo instead of the Sante Fe sauce, and no tomato.

I had a buy 1 get 1 coupon, so I got one for later. It was filling, especially when you and an order of criss cut fries.</review>

Service used to be great... Now everything is just plain; sometimes you don't even get your full order... they don't seem to understand. plus lots of homeless around the area and random people.<//review>

<Text>Horrible. Whoever works the drive thru Thursday nights should either be trained again or be fired. Same lady working there who has given me the wrong order... today was the second time! Don’t come to this one if you are expecting your order right!< /Text>< pictures>

The food was good. Unfortunately the resturant is located next to a homeless shelter. The staff treated their neighbors kindly and with respect, but my date felt uncomfortable. Our visit was cut short. No fault of the staff or restaurant.<//Review>

<text>I haven't been to this location in a while and won't be coming back. One of the worst experiences I've had. Had to repeat my order because they changed whoever was working the drive through without any heads up. I sat in my car wondering if the speaker was broken because there was such a long pause. The girl working the drive through gave off such an unpleasant demeanor and didn't even give me my receipt. Wish I got her name but she hardly faced me during my visit. I only hope the food I ordered was prepared properly.<//text>< pics>

It's is what it is, fast food. We don't have these in Minnesota. The few we have after called Hardy's. I did like it better than the Jack in the box burger of the same kind. Fries where so so.</review>

Burger was good [Big Carl] was served fries that were sitting in pan for who knows how long.  Male associate seemed new had to clarify what burger combo as I pointed to big sign in window.   It was slow and inside of dinning room was fairly clean.  Entrance to store is off one street only.</Text>

<Review>When I got to the drive through window, not only did the manager Ana tell me they forgot what I ordered and I had to repeat it, but then they put cheese on my burger when I asked for NO cheese. Clearly this place does not know how to listen. But since they allowed me to have free onion rings after all this trouble, I've given them 2 stars instead of 1.<//Review>< Name>

Item placed back on rack for resale. Don't eat here, at least not for breakfast. Ordered a burrito combo and a burrito. Due to broken display and an incompetent shift lead, my order was messed up. I opened my burrito in the car and then went back in for an exchange. The shift lead placed it back on the rack without a second thought.

Then proceeded to possibly short change me on my refund. I won't get into that due to my possible misunderstanding of the combo conversion rates and how that and taxes affect a general dollar difference in price.</review>

<Review>So today Friday June 23rd around 9:30 I got the breakfast burger and steak and egg burrito. Burger was great just meat and for my burrito the tortilla was way over cooked, crunchy ripped and not even rolled right. The cashier handed me my bag that was dripping and ripped as well from the corner and didn't even say have a nice day. The ladies there need to step it up.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Text>This is not a recommend carls jr i like to visit so much any more i would rather drive to another one besides this one because 1. Drive thru always i mean always forgets one thing in your order 2. Some times charge you something extra on your order which you did not want. 3. This one was very disappointing i was the only one in the drive thru order was quick i was surprise but when i got home which was 3 mins away i was given cold old food. The fries where fresh but my burgers disgusting ive work in the fast food chain and i know thise pattys where old and when i bite into it the pattys to cold to serve and the patty buns already hard so i dont know about this but people can get sick from this let alone if a child was serve this could of been worst. So sorry carls jr this store location is off my list.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I ordered, she repeats my order back wrong, so I repeat my order again, and she charges me double for everything. By the third round of trying to explain my order, I simply gave up and my husband had to finish the order. Then it was disgusting food and a horrible experience. I had to ask for my receipt like 4 times. I was furious.</Review>

I've been there a couple times in the last week and ordered the same thing, a double breakfast burger meal medium with a root beer.  The first time they gave me a single. The second time they didn't give me my drink, and when I tried to call no one would answer. This location really needs to step up they're game< /Review>

The worst experience ever! We spent over $30 on food and not only was the order completely wrong, but they kept half of our food as well! Tried to call to complain and they don't answer phones there either. Now I have two hungry and unhappy kids.</Text>

<Text>Hours online and window say open til 9pm. All the lights are on and a worker is inside at 8:15pm but the store is closed. You almost had $75-$100 a week in sales considering this is closer to me than any other smoke shop or gas station.

<text>Great Shop. Iv been a customer of this shop since I turned 18... I'm 25 years old now. This shop never disappoints in terms of customer service and glass prices. For example, I paid 60 dollars for a bong identical to one I almost bought at Illusion Smoke Shop down the road for 100 dollars but decided to look at Cigarette City first and I'm glad I did. Keep doin what you do Cigarette City 👍👍👍👍👍<//text>< pics>

I bought a disposable vape from this location, and an 30 min later it stopped working. I followed the instructions before using the product, and I also tried changing it when it stopped working. When I called the shop regarding the issue the manager reached out to the owner to see what he can do to resolve the issue, but the owner said there’s nothing he can do(no refund, no replacement, and no discount) . I wasn’t mad because the device stopped working I was mad because I felt like I was robbed by this shop. It would’ve been ok if they would have gave me a discount off my next one but nope.  To me this seemed shady as hell and won’t give them anymore of my business.<//text>

Usually a decent experience, though once I had one of their employees sell me the wrong product, and then try to cover it up to his boss which I spoke to via phone. After coming back a week after, the employee admits that he was wrong and sold me the wrong one. Was very frustrating, hope he got sacked.</Text>

<Review>I usually go there for all my vaping needs and so far i havent been disappointed. The products are great quality, the prices are great and cheaper than the surrounding smoke shops. Even the gentleman at the counter is very helpful and kind, and he also dishes out good discounts here and there.

Definitely recommended.< /Review>< pictures>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>The cashier had his little buddy hanging out with him. As I start to swipe my card, the dude is just standing there, staring over my shoulder.  So i asked him to please give me space to conduct my business. He continued to stand there staring until he finally beat it. The cashier was also just standing there staring. Never said a word to me. No kind of greeting or anything. So after I finally paid for my cigarettes, he held the receipt while asking me repeatedly if I want my receipt. Weirdest experience EVER!< /review>< date>

The owner of this wine shop is a spectacular person! He is knowledgeable about his wine. But more importantly, he is a wonderful human being. He is wise, funny, entertaining and full of energy. I could have talked to him for hours. I hope we have the opportunity to cross paths again during our lifetimes.<//Review>

This store is the absolute best!if you have a chance, look at the attached pictures. Words do not begin to describe how large a selection of rums, whiskey, scotch, cognac, brandy, gin, etc. This store is slightly smaller than their main store off of El cajon boulevard.

If you are looking for something Specific to either enjoy, or as a gift, kegel bottle is definitely a place worth visiting. Regardless of the type of alcoholic beverage you are looking for, they will have that selection.  The prices they charge for their selection are completely reasonable, too. They do have some drinks that they will have on sale. On the hole, everything in there is completely reasonable in price with a selection that isn't matched anywhere else in the San Diego area!<//Review>

To see if we liked some, we stopped in for a wine tasting. Sophia helped us choose what we wanted and showed us the difference between wine styles and how they were made. We ended up buying three bottles and we got wine glasses for free! Sophia was very well-informed and supportive. I suggest them highly!</review>

I wish I knew the cashiers name... So I could give her all the credit. I see she is very busy though, so I never bother to ask.

She is there most of the time and I notice she is friendly to all customer's and she does it all with a smile) Amazing.<//Text>

I am so happy to report that Keg N Bottle is now carrying Rothaus Tannenzäpfle!! ❤ I have been on a quest to find it in San Diego for years! Today my dream came true 🤩 The store is highly organized and they carry a very large variety of everything. Easy off the 805 and excellent parking. Frank the manager is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.  Go see Frank and buy this beer!!! Cheers 🍻</Text>

I want to thank my Man Ferris & Keg & Bottle for the help in the store. Sometimes it could hard working behind the counter and dealing with so man people. But You know what it's people like me that will come in and briten up the days of others. But not only me, there are other people that think to pick others and appreciate them for what they in the community that we work in or just Bing able to be a part of. I use to come in to this store alot when I was working for Move Central. Me all the guys. And you guys have always been kind to us and treated us with respect so I thank you all that work at the Square. My family to yours< /Review>

A one stop shop for fine spirits and craft beer. A hidden gem tucked away in sorrento valley. I knew the place existed, ive lived in the mira mesa area for a long time. but searching for different expressions of scotch to try led me here for the first time. To say their selection is amazing is an understatement.  Have you been wanting to try a particular whisky that you cant find anywhere locally? Do you have a favorite distillery but cant find their other expressions/offerings? Looking for vintage/rare? This place probably has it. Their prices are not too competitive, tbh, but i felt they were fair considering they stock so many different kinds that ive only ever seen online. If scotch isnt your thing, their bourbon and irish selection was just as impressive. Staff was super helpful and patient and made great recommendations. Will be visiting again when its time to try something new.</text>

This is my go-to place in San Diego for a wide variety of Whiskeys. All though Keg N Bottle is widely known for their huge craft beer selection,  they are a major player for Whiskey enthusiasts like myself. The store in Sorrento Valley is my favorite. The staff is knowledgeable, friendly, and always helpful.<//Text>< Rate>

They refill CO2 for the cheapest I've seen. And if you want beer they have an INSANE selection. The staff are so friendly and helpful and even help you load your car. Would recommend, I'll be a repeat customer.<//review>< Rate>

<Rating>2< /Rating><name>A Wong<//name><Review>This store is selling sakes that are "EXPIRED and HAVE GONE BAD".  Please don't go into this store unless you want to walk out with bottles of expired alcohol.  I purchased three bottles of sparkling sake on 12/21/2012 from there and found out later that they were produced in 2009 and should be consumed within 120 days.  Plus, the sakes were not being stored properly.  They were just sitting on the self at room temperature when clearly on the bottle's label, "Keep Refrigerated"  No wonder not only there's no bubble when opened plus the taste was awful.  I even asked the owner about the expiration date because I saw a set of date (21.9.24) on the cap.  The owner assured that the sakes are fine and even if that's the expiration date, it should be either year of 2021/2024 so they are all good.  Later I googled and found out that the number 21 is era in Japan which corresponds to year of 2009 in Western era.  Even if the owner didn't know how to decode the date on the cap, he sure should have known those three bottles of sparkling sake have been on the shelf "FOREVER" and should be taken down instead of selling to people.  Since I bought the last three bottles I even asked if they will be getting more.  Answer I got was, yes, we always restock our inventory and in fact, order has been placed.  "LIAR! LIAR! LIAR!"  "SUCH TERRIBLE STORE!"< /Review>< Time>

Every time I enter this store the men that work there are very rude ...especially to women! There can be nobody in the store and they'll choose to do other things rather than help the one customer that is in there ! Don't think will be visiting the store ever again ...it's happened at least three times in the last four visits!👎<//Text>

Always remodeling this place. You have to wait for anyone of the 3 or four clerks to stop talking to each other loudly to finally acknowledge your existence.  Then you actually get to pay your hard earned money to them for their over priced stuff.< /Review>

Huge selection. Large cold-storage area with six packs and cans as well.

I'm usually the only person here whenever I visit. Prices are fair. They aren't the cheapest you'll find, but they are pretty average. I don't think this place gets visited by "Beer Geeks" very often, so I can sometimes find some great beers that are sold out in other locations.< /Review>

We took our granddaughter Lily to Topline Autoplex LLC In Fontana to look for a vehicle. It was our last stop in a very long day. We were tired and frustrated but nevertheless browsed in hopes of finding “the” car. We took a ride in several vehicles and finally Lily found the one she liked. She chose the White 2010 Toyota Corolla. The gentleman that helped us was Benny. He was very busy but was friendly and helpful. He accepted our offer and started the paperwork and we were finished in about an hour. He wished us well and prior to leaving he gave Lily a gas card to fill up her tank. While the lot was full of cars Benny managed to move those rather quickly so that people could test drive the vehicle. Thank you for your your help, kindness and patience Benny. We had a favorable experience.<//Review>

<Text>The salesman was very rude and wasn't very enthusiastic about our business at all! Thankfully, he was willing to work with us on an okay price. The mechanics and car washers were very very kind though and ensured our experience wasn't so bad :). They let us test drive the car. The car, after a brief inspection, seemed okay... it had a small oil leak, a bit of shock leak, and a few scratches/minor rust. Otherwise, very clean. The price of the car was very high but somewhat understandable. Overall, an okay experience. If the salesman wasn't so rude, I would say 5 stars!

If you want good service, please avoid this place. The salesman even left during our initial transaction a few minutes before closing time. The mechanic took over and was very good. Otherwise, eh.

Kudos to the mechanics and car washers.<//Text><Time>1615701084496< /Time><resp>None<//resp>< pictures>

Bought a Nissan Rogue 2014. Price was fair. On the day I took it home, I noticed severe transmission issues but I called Kenny for help. I took it back and he got it fixed. Then I had a tire issue. He got that fixed as well even though it was not engine or transmission related (he agreed to fix it because it was flat before I Bought it). Reason I’m giving 5stars is because Kenny never tried to weasel his way out of fixing the issue. He was nice about everything, and worked with my financial situation. Also, when I first went in, I also have to say I didn’t feel pressured and was not followed around. The mechanic who works there simply gave my spouse the keys and told us to feel free and test drive it. I felt trusted and comfortable. :) super happy with the experience.<//review>

Just bought a 2008 Jeep Grand Cherokee 4x4. They were a big help and they brought the price down for me! I really appreciate their help! The dealership was great and they even helped with my trade-in. No problems at all. I will definitely be back after the experience I had. Good price on vehicles as well.

We were very impressed with the efficiency of the purchasing process. We knew what make and model of car we wanted, saw it in line, called to make sure it was still available, test drove it, decided on a price... 10 minutes later we exchanged cash for keys! Super happy.< /Review>

Wow what an awesome experience!
Ben is a great salesman!
Drove in from San Diego and they agreed to fair price over email and had all the paperwork ready to go! No hassle and we were in and out within 1/2 an hour! This is the way car buying should be!
Great cars at a great price and helpful people.
After a bad experience buying another used car at a large dealership a month previous this was a welcome change. Keep up the good work!</text>

<review>I found this dealer through CarGuru and decided to visit the dealer to see what they had in stock. Test drove a few cars and fell in love with an 09 GTI. I came back a few weeks later with the down payment. I knew finding a bank wanting to finance me would be difficult but Kenny was able to pull it off and get me in the car I wanted at the payments I wanted. The car needed a new tint job and he was happy to do it before I purchased the car. I would recommend you swing by this place and check it out.< /review><name>Blaine Auckerman</name>< pictures>

This is the third car I have purchased from them in the past couple years, and I would not hesitate to refer them to a friend. The salesman was extremely helpful and answered all my questions. They were not pushy at all. I've purchased from other dealers in the past, but Topline has always been the best in my opinion. And their selections is second to none.</Text>< Pictures>

<Review>The customer service was pretty good until my transmission blew up while I was still fully covered by warranty. I was told it by Kenny that it was my fault, but I've been driving a manual transmission car for years, and I've never had a problem with any other transmission like I did with this one. Also, after they took it to their own mechanic, the engine blew up and I looked under the car and the pressure plate was completely trashed. Kenny doesn't want to cover me when I have the warranty on it still...overall I would never trust this dealership ever again, they are shady and won't admit or compensate for their mistakes.< /Review>< user_name>

Kenny was very helpful and honest, only a couple slight issues with the car that were looked over and either fixed or determined not to be a problem, and warrantee modified to help us feel secure.<//Review>

Only reason they have 5 star reviews are because they give you a $50 gas card if you do. I will not leave them there 5 stars if i could i would give them 0. Avoid this place and i mean it. Look for better deals somewhere else.  Fyi did not buy a car here, went somewhere else and i hope you do too.< /Text>< pics>

{'time': 1544655230699, 'text': 'Hi edwin,\n\nI just saw you left a review about me and the dealership and I just wanted to see if I can sort out any confusions during the time you were here. I recall that I’ve made a mistake of entering your moms ITN number as SSN and got an lower apr the it should and that’s the reason you rejected the finance. I apologize for the confusion I had caused in regards to that.\n\nIf you have not purchased a car somewhere else already, I would like to ask for another chance to offer my services of finding you the best possible financing for you and your mom. If not then I just wanted to apologize for the misunderstanding and wish you the best. It was never my intentions to misinform you or cause any hardship for you or your family. My job as a car salesman is to sell you the car you want with the best terms to meet your needs. It doesn’t benefit me in anyway to increase your interest rate and lose the sale. We do not profit from the interest rates from financing as those were set and collected by the bank.\n\nI sincerely hope you would understand and hope that I have somewhat cleared the confusion between us. We never ask customers to leave a 5 star ratings in order to receive the gas card. We do this as an incentive to the customer and to increase our online exposure. It is solely their own decision of whether they want to leave a 5 star or any star rating for our service.\n\nKenny'}<//response>

This place is a complete disaster, the customer service is trash. I purchased a car here and was very disappointed, the transmission had blown a week after purchase date. The owner of the shop known as Kenny recommended me to his mechanic where he had refused to pay for the damage to the car as well as verbally abusing me after explaining the damage was not done by myself. I do not recommend this place what so ever!!!!<//review>

<Text>Drove 70 miles to look at a 2006 mazda3.  Got there at 930am and was told that the guy who has access to the keys wasnt in yet (they open at 9am).  Found the car i wanted to see and noticed it was priced on the lot for $1500 more than it was listed online.  I was told that the online price was for cash only and that the online price was the lowest the owner would go.  It would be nice to mention that clearly on the website.  Not to mention that even the online price was a thousand over blue book.  No thanks.
RESPONSE TO THE OWNERS RESPONSE:
There was no misunderstanding between me and your salesperson.  Your salesperson told me what I detailed above.  The vehicle had 6995 listed on it when I arrived when it is listed online for 5500.  The only misunderstanding lies between you and your salesperson.  Not only that but why do I have to make an appointment?  Are you a doctors office or a car dealership?  The saddest part about the entire situation is that we were planning to drive the car home..guess it wasn't meant to be....< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

What a joke, 1st thing I had to do was an oil change because they put the wrong oil in it, could have blown the motor.
2nd thing had to replace was the starter after it left me stranded, 65.- towing and $250.- for the starter.
3rd, water pump went out, also had to change all the hoses, another $350.- out of pocket.
4th, the left front wheel hub had to be replaced, there was another 325.-.
5th, mechanic now says front end needs complete rebuild, that is now estimated at $2700.-.
6th, the fuel pump just went out, so now it sits in the back yard and Ihave no Fn vehicle.
The list goes on, I think you get the idea.
DO NOT BUY FROM HERE.
And yes, they give you $50.- to write a good review.
Just replaced the radiator, too!!!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c34cff60c1b7a5:0x2c4d39fd949f58c2< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

There was a pile (at least 4) of used needles on the waiting room floor in plain sight.... very unsafe and gross. The lady working at the check in desk of the laboratory was extremely rude and unhelpful. Even though I was the only person standing at the counter, she refused to look at me and offer assistance. I had to ask if I was in the right spot to check in, not a big deal having to ask if she didn't notice me, but she definitely saw me and was ignoring me, when I asked she was very short and unpleasant. However, The doctor and nurse were extremely nice and helpful.</Text>

The lab line is always backed up with nurses letting members cut the line if they throw a fit about waiting in line like the rest of us. Having an appointment with the lab is useless. Plan on arriving an hour earlier than your appointment AT LEAST. Also, the nurses holding the line warned us that we shouldn’t come on Mondays or Fridays because those are their busiest days. If that’s so, maybe management should staff appropriately those days to minimize wait times. This happened on Friday, 2/19 2021.<//text>

<text>There is no sign for urgent care, all you see is covid testing. We were waiting and waiting and couldn't get through. Horrible signage, don't know where the other reviewer saw good signage. Once inside, everyone was very nice and I got in quickly- saw someone within 20 minutes of checking in. As long as you don't have to deal with the long line, it's a good choice.<//text><rating>3<//rating>< Resp>

Great place most of the time, but they really need better signage during COVID. Lots of people having the same questions because there are no signs, or the signs are confusing.</text>

<Review>I have been a Kaiser member for 33 years, this is my second pregnancy but the first time I’ve used the Pasadena location for obgyn. My appointment was at 10:30, I did not see the doctor until after 11:30. I informed them of my severe morning sickness, and they treated me as if I had covid. They rushed my to the Covid testing location, ( test was negative ). The doctor didn’t ask me anything about my pregnancy, and anything I asked her she basically shrugged off. By far my worst experience ever. I wish I could switch back to Dr. Lopez at the Gardena Kaiser obgyn location, he was outstanding my entire 9 months in 2016.<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Went to the “Drive Through” Urgent Care on Foothill Blvd., Pasadena this morning.  Signs along the driveway were clear and plenty to tell you which line is for COVID testing and which line is for Urgent Care.  Got there right before 9am and was treated at 9:05am. Very pleased with the dr and her medical team. They were cordial, thorough and highly competent.  So grateful to have such excellent service! Hats off to Dr Sandra Montes! After the drive-thru clinic, sat in the car on a parked spot to receive prescriptions!!  Yes, the medicines were delivered to your car by Pharmacy team!!  Appreciate the thoughtful system addresses our needs and safety protection against any possible spread of COVID19.<//review>< pics>

I have used their Urgent Care twice and both times they did an outstanding job. My non-Kaiser doctor describes Kaiser as an ethical HMO. I would agree with that assessment. They get a lot of patients here, but they were well organized and I was getting urgent medical care within one hour of my arrival both times. I am very glad they are here.< /review>

I got urgent care at this facility, at the main entrance the triage nurse ask me something. I asked I think I have an angina. The guy at the main entrance told me you have corona virus,, and sent me the garage for covid suspicious. Even if I show him my the negative covid test result 5 days ago, he did not listen and send me the garage of covid place. I wait for one hour and 45 min, met the doctor. He checked and said to me you are not covid patient why you are here. I just got upset. Eventually the doctor escort me to inside urgent care facility and I got the right service there. It took total 3 hours and 40 min. Long day. Kaiser should train tight for the triage nurse. It's horrible and unacceptable. Bad day.<//text>

This is the worst kaiser location  I’ve been too.. The service really hurting Kaiser’s reputation. I came  here because it’s the nearest location, but I always have to go to another kaiser the next day to be seen by good doctors. They need to get better doctors and nicer nurses. Work more on cleaning the place. I wish they teach their staff to be  kind and caring with the patients especially with kids.</text>

Did I mention the lab staff almost discouraged me from taking a few tests that ended up coming in positive? My doctor had little sympathy and completely disregarded my needs. I didn't want to miss work. This was not a simple stomach ache situation.

Came in a little late? Too bad you're sick. Reschedule or get in line at urgent care.

If it keeps going like this, I might just change HMO.

The facility is clean and nice. Parking is easy and the location is right off the metro. Baldwin Park and West LA have been better to me.<//Review><date>1546475823234</date>< pics>

<Time>1528207059744<//Time><Text>Not sure where all the bad reviews are coming from. It’s my experience that I usually can get a same day appointment;  sometimes literally within a couple of hours of call the call center. I always make a point of calling the  appointment center as soon as they open at 7am.
My GP is great, very caring!  I feel she takes the time to listen, she does what it takes to get the correct diagnosis, ordering tests or giving a referral, if needed.
I’ve been coming to this location for 8 years. I’m not crazy about urgent care and try to avoid going, as the wait times can be long.
All in all, this is a good place to come for medical care. When I consider how many people that get treated on a daily basis at this facility, I’m Impressed.<//Text></record>

The pharmacy is completely disorganized and unprofessional. Several pharmacy techs were rude and seemed confused about my Rx.

Parking is free. That’s the only pro.

I’ve been to this location and one in Glendale and at both, providers have given me the briefest amount of attention and rushed me out. My primary care doc is always late and I’m lucky if I get 10 minutes with her.

They’ve got one X-ray machine for two urgent cares and all the other doctors in the building. I waited for 90 minutes once and that was with a STAT order.

The physical therapy department is a joke. You get an initial hour assessment at your first visit but if you ever need to go back for another problem, you don’t get another full assessment, just 30 minutes. The two PTs I saw there were bored or clueless. I never got any answer as to how I might have gotten tendinitis so I don’t know how to prevent it in the future. I also never got any consensus on what exercises I should avoid so 5 months later, I’m still in pain and now have an appointment with an orthopedist. I’m sure that will be a quality visit...< /Text>

Her nurse, Melissa was the worst! As soon as I walked in, she gave me attitude and made me sound dumb. She made very snarky comments and honestly, made me not want to come back.

If this is the staff Kaiser prides themselves in, then I might be having to change insurances because nurses and doctors should be there to help not make you want to never visit the doctors office again.</Review>< Pics>

<Text>They lost my Rx then refilled it wrong. Ended up taking 3x longer then they said it would just to fill a prescription. I like Kaiser but they need to figure out this disorganized pharmacy.< /Text>< Rate>

Every time I call Kaiser the whole process is inconvenient and frustrating. They don't have the department numbers listed, so I always have to go through a call center. Then when I am transferred, I am put on hold. Today I was on hold for a whole 15 minutes with the patient financial department to get a print out of my co-pays for the year. They were only able to give me part of what I needed, and I had to get through a couple more transfers to talk to the right department to get the rest of what I needed for taxes. On average, I have to be transferred twice to talk to the right person. Please come up with a different system. I get off the frustrated every time I call Kaiser.< /text>

<Text>Very navigable, full-service Kaiser Permanente medical facility with an urgent care center in suburban Pasadena along Foothill Blvd. The facility is one building with a parking garage. It is extremely easy to access with plentiful and free parking. There is also surface parking spaces closer to the building for handicap accessibility. The facility is also close to a Gold Line Station.</Text>< pictures>

The downstairs check in is horrible, set us up with a Dr for our son that isn’t even at this location send us upstairs to the 3rd urgent care waiting over an hour as everyone is just going on past us one by one. Ask one of the nurses and they told us the reason which I stated above. If we didn’t have issues with the check in downstairs in the past I would’ve just let this go but not the first time.< /Text>

<review>I have been with Kaiser for awhile and this is by far the worst facility I have been to in the LA region. I just moved to the aarea a couple months ago so this is my new close Kaiser. Out the 4 times I have been here I have been sent to the wrong area twice....and the wait times are pretty bad.....maybe it's because they are sending people to the wrong areas....also they do not keep this facility up to date....a lot of stains on the carpets and chairs are run down(especially in pediatrics)....I have been to a decent amount of Kaiser facilities and this one just isn't being managed properly it seems like. Also, it really hard to get any kind of appt for working people. You have to take off work to go to any appts which for a full time working parent is really hard...I have sent in a couple complaints to upper MGMT about it hopefully they take a closer look</review>< Date>

<Text>By far the worse Kaiser location I've been too. Receptionists are so rude and cut you off half of your question to tell you to take a number and sit down. Then when you ask a question they make you feel like it's a dumb question, considering this is an urgent care facility they shouldn't be making people feel this way. Then you have to wait about 15 mins just to get called for check in. The wait to see a doctor is about 2-3 hrs.< /Text>< user_id>

During my enployeer's open enrollment season for 2017 benifits selected Kaiser as my family's health plan. This is the first time I ever had Kaiser. So far I'm impressed with the service at the Pasadena location. It was easy getting the labs drawn for our family's annual physical and also picking up my wife's and my percriptions while we were there. While we were there my wife also had her mammogram. Nurses Elena and Jennifer were great. A few weeks later my wife and I went back for follow up. Jennifer recognized our son from our previous visit and spent some time talking to him. A week later I had to go to the nurse clinic for an eat wash Alexa explained everything and got the excess wax out. I can hear much better. Good job Alexa. All in all I had three great experiences so far.< /Review>

< review>
I've been taking a specific medicine for years. From the manufacturersame point of view   this medicine shouldn't be  a problem. As with other users using the same  medication reported on many forums. Kids have no issues? Hmm. Before this medication was purchased by a US corporation with a manufacturing company now in Glendale. I find it peculiar  that the meds seem to be  not as affective  prior to switching. Since then Ive experienced a slower metabolism weight gain in the abdomen. YET I'M NOT A DIABETIC? CURIOUS these things resemble effects from other medications according  to online resources. To include a "hump like buffalo"  posture specific to the neck area.  Last year I tested the same medications using a droplet liquid test the results were not  consistent with whatever it should be. They either turned completely black or purple suggesting opiods mdma. These capsules are harder densities may differ subtle difference between the before and after switch are curious as well.   This is really ackward to me. These meds give me the munchies and create a lot of resistance in performance. Which they should not be. Research yes I'll continue to research and report updates to this very peculiar situation.

<Review>I spent almost four hours there last night.  In those four hours I received a ten minute breathing treatment, a ten minute x-ray and was seen by the "urgent care" doctor for about ten minutes.
If only I'd brought my copy of Middlemarch.  The doctor called me today to inform me that I may have pneumonia and that anti-biotics have been prescribed.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>David Canas<//Name><Gmap_id>0x80c2dc9de22ba2c9:0x6b67f00e7b062ec0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Food was some really good vegan Mexican! Loved their tacos and taquitos. Lower rating is because the lady taking our order stared at us and was very unfriendly. Also, some of the food is under seasoned and they don’t serve limes which is confusing because it’s Latin American cuisine...? This restaurant is holding themselves back from their potential< /review>

The tacos aren’t even in Oakland’s Top 10 but they certainly get first place for most expensive. If you want to pay $12 for two passable tacos and some slices of radish, this is the place for you. If you have money sense or taste buds, go elsewhere.< /review>

This is the healthiest Mexican food I’ve ever had. Brown rice and organic beans along with handmade really thick and fluffy tacos. Also the taquito was fried to perfection. Really good place to try if you’re in the area</Text>

The Mexican cuisine have a lot of vegan options. In Mexico City you can get a vegan Huarache if you order without cheese or sour cream. The Huarache in Flacos is just ok. Spicy salsa is really hot but no flavor. Rice in a Huarache???
I respect the intention of this place but Mexican cuisine have traditionally vegetarian and vegan options, you just  need to add your signature, like a super spicy tasty salsa...<//review>

<review>It is really nice to have a vegetarian style Mexican eatery. Taquitos were super crunchy satisfying, avocado and red salsas were very good, banana leaf tamal (I think it is called) was tastey. Now everything else we ordered, beans rice tamale wasn't bad just not stand out. Just dump the salsa all over and you will be happy. Our service was fast and friendly.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80857e7ef9d5df71:0x533609721c01ad53< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Excellent vegan mexican food! We tried one of everything and loved it all, but the tacos with the soy meat were our favorite. We will definitely be coming here again! Warning: the spicy salsa is super spicy, so get the mild one too just in case!< /Text>

Also no avocado in it at all as advertised. I made my own guac at home and added it lol.

And the horchata (even after mixing) was like water this time. Disappointing and felt ripped off for $17. No quality control.

Will only get a la carte tamales from now on.

Update: they were willing to give me a side of the mole when I asked about it! Didn’t mention the horchata bcuz I was down to just let that go.

Updating to four stars bcuz I want to support small biz and because the tamales and taquitos are still good. Everything else not consistent ><<//Review><Time>1609977316454< /Time><GmapID>0x80857e7ef9d5df71:0x533609721c01ad53</GmapID><userid>101375435443048285641< /userid>< Response>

<review>Truly outstanding food. Being vegan is incidental to the flavor and quality. Though the menu is brief, there are ample options. The outdoor seating, adjacent to the parking lot, is so removed from the street it's not even an issue. The counter staff is very nice and helpful, answering questions and bring really helpful.<//review><Name>Richard Lossing</Name>< gmapID>

I really wanted to like this place as a vegetarian that loves mexican food but honestly, this food was so bad. Like, I haven’t eaten at all today and I dont even want to finish one taco. They’re really plain & dry and didnt even come with a lime. The taquitos were worse, the tortilla is way too crispy and thick and it comes with one single slice of fake meat in the middle that tastes like dog food imo (although my vegetarian boyfriend kind of liked it). The service was nice though, the guy at the front was very friendly. Overall I’m really disappointed.<//text>

<Review>Vegan Mexican food, what more do you need?! Staffs friendly and I love stuff made to order. Had a question about tortillas and they added their input and guidance. A must go date spot for any new vegan couple's, my lady and I visit at least once a month. The green sauce and the taquitos are a must.<//Review><rate>5</rate><gmapID>0x80857e7ef9d5df71:0x533609721c01ad53</gmapID>< Resp>

Flaco's is the place to go if you're in the mood for fresh vegan Mexican food. They also have gluten free soy free options. The soft tacos are a hit with me..<//review>

I just started incorporating vegan food into my diet and a friend of mine reccomended this spot. They have a pretty great menu selection and the pricing for everything is perfect. Not too pricey like some vegan spots out there. I ordered bulk taquitos and it came with 6. Super flaky, the soy protein was seasoned right and I was very satisfied. Im only giving them 4 stars because when they packed in the food one of the salsa lids wasn't closed all the way and got stuck to the foil and spilled all over my lap. Other than that mishap. Great spot and im probably gonna go back for lunch today lol. 👏🏾👏🏾👍🏾<//text>

Watered down horchata in dirty looking plastic cups 16 oz? more like 14 oz. if filled up to the top, which it was not.
Tiny dining area, worn down past the threads, dirt on the windows in the eating area.
My first time at a vegan restaurant, does "Vegan" restaurant mean no hygiene?
I now know why so many people got orders to go...
It seems like the site is not long for this world with a public hearing scheduled for the site to convert it to a mixed use development.< /text><rate>2< /rate>< userid>

<review>This place was awesome! We needed a quick bite before driving back south. We each ordered a tamal - regular and banana leaf. Both were very, very flavorful and a reasonable size. The salsas are also very tasty. We had both the green and the red and would highly recommend both. We will definitely be back next time we're in the area!<//review>< pics>

I loved the food and it was very affordable. Most of the menu, if not all, was naturally gluten free--and, of course, vegan. They even had vegan horchata (although that was the one part of my order that I didn't really like--it was a bit watery.) The service was lovely. I'm always happy to patronize local vegan businesses, especially those specializing in international cuisine!<//Review>

Simple standard menu and drinks. Really delicious though and can’t go wrong with any choice. Avocado salsa is the best but accidentally gave me hottest once 😭🔥 wish they made more delicious vegan things! Also not cheap but so yummy!<//text>

<text>Flacos is a 10/10! My bf is a vegetarian so we normally have to go to places that have veggie options and I will sometimes opt out of my carnivorous ways and choose da greens but I'm not always a fan.  Let me tell you right quick - OH👏MY👏GAWD👏 Flacos is on a whole new level in my opinion! The "meat" in the tacos, taquitos and banana leaf tamales taste just like REAL MEAT. I was blown away! It was flippin delicious! So much flavor & color! Hole in the way place - obvi had to take it to-go due to covid but they have tables outside that you can stand and eat at. My new favorite vegan place! 😋♥️
p.s. I usually take pics of my food but my bf already bit into everything before I could pull out my phone for a snap! Lol 😅< /text>< Pictures>

This place is so good! I've been craving good Mexican food but struggling really hard to find somewhere where I have options in northern California. However this place has now become such a habit for me, I have to leave with at least as many taquitos as I can carry as I waddle out with happiness.<//review>

<Rate>4</Rate><text>Pretty good vegan Mexican! This spot has good variety and I got the taquitos with medium hot sauce. They were flavorful and delicious, with rice/beans/salad on the side. My only complaint would be the portion sizes (a bit small for the price) and the spice level. Despite ordering it medium hot, it was pretty intense (at least for me). Overall, I’d definitely come here again.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

I was definitely skeptical when I heard about vegan Mexican food. The taco where great. Even the rice and beans were tastier than what you'd typically get at a Mexican place. Highly recommend the avocado sauce for your tacos as well. Very refreshing.<//review>

Omg very good Vegan tacos, you can have some fresh and crunchy beats with yummy corn tortillas with a very convincing meat substitute or the "Mother of all salads" con handmade monster tortilla that will GUARANTEE fill you up<//text>

<Review>Read about this place in a number of different articles that ranked it as one of the top vegan places in the bay. Very disappointed 😞. The nicest thing you can say is bland. The worst is terrible flavor. The rice was dry with no flavor, the beans tasted like rinsed canned beans, the taco "meat" was gross, the tamale was hard to eat, and my son thought the soy meat in the rolled taco was a cookie. The mild salsa had no flavor and no heat at all and the hot had no flavor and too much heat. And it was expensive. Complete waste of money. I'm full and still hungry because I'm not satisfied at all. Never going back. O. And the horchata was, you guessed it, bland.<//Review>< Pictures>

Vegan and really tasty. Tuesdays are half-price taquitos! The folks running it are friendly. Inside is a bit dark and cramped, so eat outside or get it to go. The only real drawback is that it usually takes a while to get your order, but it really is worth it.<//Review>

<Text>I had the taquitos and Huaraches. Every single flavor and texture was ON POINT. Nothing was lacking here, whereas a lot of vegan stuff misses the mark for me when serving up substitutions for classic meat dishes. This place will inspire you to think more about that</Text>< name>

Slow even when there's no one else who has ordered. Took 26 minutes to make one entre and there were only 2 people who had ordered in front of me. And there's barely enough space to sit down.

When I got my food, there was zero acknowledgement of the wait. They seem to think this is OK.

The actual food was dry and not flavorful. Their hot sauce was mild, at best. Unbelievably disappointed.

Won't come back.< /Text>

I discovered Flacos by word of mouth as I was in the neighborhood and needed to contribute to a potluck. I knew there would be vegans in the group and I heard the vegan Mexican food here was quite good and it most certainly was! Folks at the potluck who were not aware of the food being vegan had no idea and were blown away. My personal favorite were the tamales. Vegan or not, I highly recommend checking Flacos out.< /review>

They a have the best green sauce!! So spicy, so fire. If you're not sure what to get, the taquitos are a must. So crispy and delicious. I enjoyed eating outside under the lights and vintage looking table and chairs. Flacos is so unique and a Berkely staple.< /Text>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>Today I was sitting outside eating my "four and four" (four tacos and four taquitos), which is a lot of food for lunch, but I have a pretty active evening ahead . . .

So as I said, I was sitting outside Flaco's eating my delicious lunch (good goddess are the fresh-made maza amazing!) when Russell Brand comes walking up.  He steps through the trees between the sidewalk and the tables, and sits down and starts chatting me up.  He could see I was pretty much in seventh heaven with a mouthful of vegan taquito (and the medium sauce should be sold by the GALLON!), so he tells me about a rather happening dance event every Wednesday in Oakland (you'll have to see my other reviews to find out where exactly) that he regularly attends.  Kind of funny because I didn't actually say anything to him about how much I enjoy dancing.  But anyways, he gets up, walks in to Flaco's and that was my lunch-time run-in with someone you may have heard of, right here in the Bay Area.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Flaco's is just great Mexican food. the fact that it's vegan is just a nice bonus. they're at the Berkeley farmer's market every Saturday but I've been coming to their restaurant on Ashby for a wider selection of food.

I heard that they're going to have to move since their current location is bring redeveloped. I really hope they find a new location and not just close down... would be a shame</text>

<Review>Very good authentic food. The menu looks humble, but everything we tried packed a lot of flavor, and the portions were huge. I was happy to have a lot of fresh-tasting seasonal vegetables heaped on my plate. Worth a visit if you're in the area and want a no-frills, filling, tasty meal.<//Review>< pictures>

So as I said, I was sitting outside Flaco's eating my delicious lunch (good goddess are the fresh-made maza amazing!) when Russell Brand comes walking up.  He steps through the trees between the sidewalk and the tables, and sits down and starts chatting me up.  He could see I was pretty much in seventh heaven with a mouthful of vegan taquito (and the medium sauce should be sold by the GALLON!), so he tells me about a rather happening dance event every Wednesday in Oakland (you'll have to see my other reviews to find out where exactly) that he regularly attends.  Kind of funny because I didn't actually say anything to him about how much I enjoy dancing.  But anyways, he gets up, walks in to Flaco's and that was my lunch-time run-in with someone you may have heard of, right here in the Bay Area.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

LOVE THIS PLACE!
The ambiance is great, the staff Is always great, every time I go I get greeted by my favorite employee Ana, she makes the BEST dishes and will make you feel valued as a customer. I go at least 3 times a month and I am never disappointed. My favorite dish is a taquito plate because Ana will always make sure they are done crispy and right! Overall the staff is great but flacos is amazing because of Ana!<//review>

Vegan,  mid-priced,  delicious! This is NOT your typical Mexican fare, however, but you don't have to be very adventurous to really enjoy it. Spectacular choice for vegans and vegetarians and anyone who has an even mildly expanded palate!< /review>

Food was good, but the portions were too small and they charge for salsa which seemed odd for a mexican restaurant. The staff was less than friendly and the decor needs work.< /Review>

I love this place, the food is great and atmosphere is great. The only bad thing is if you go at night with a group or just want to eat outside, bring an 3xtra jacket because it is so freaking cold. Good thing the salsa is hot!!</text>

Everything here is really tasty, but prepare to wait because it takes a while to get your food.

The owner is really nice too. He offers a punch card for full plate offers.</Text>

Good vegan food at decent prices this restaurant in the heart of Berkeley is a pretty good representation of what Berkeley is all about. Well the building is a bit old and the decor is not super fancy the food is tasty and spicy. I'd highly recommend if you're looking for vegan fare.</Review>

The taquitos are the best. I could eat 20 of them. Beans and rice are light and delicious. My mother got a tamal that was unique from a traditional tamal, but she loved the flavors. My only wish is that they got some cheeze and chips.< /Review>

Amazing, amazing (did I say... Amazing?) taquitos here. All food is vegan friendly. Tried their *warm* horchata this time too and it was also delicious. I've tried the tacos and the tamales here as well, both delicious. Their spicy sauce is SPICY. I usually ask for mild or a mix of mild and hot. The only down side is that the two don't mix well so you always have pockets of stupid spicy. Another plus is great customer service. Staff are all extremely friendly and if you order takeout and waiting around, they'll walk it up to you. Seating inside is tight and gets packed easily. Outside seating is great, when the Great Winds are not sweeping o'er the plain and you can't feel your fingers enough to pick up your delicious taquitos.<//text>

If I had known this was a vegetarian taco spot I may not have stopped in, but I have to say that the two tacos con mole they gave me were absolutely fantastic, fresh, the salsa was beautiful, so tortillas from mi finca were very fresh, and it was just all put together in an absolutely awesome way. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan but I will be back none the less because this rocks.. piece of trivia for folks from the neighborhood, flaco's tacos used to be the stand over at the Ashby flea market and have now moved up to their own location. Check them out! Great people too< /text>

<Text>Excellent street-style vegan tacos, some of the most authentic and tasty that I've ever tried. The price is right and the quality is great. I feel like I'm eating tacos at a taqueria in Mexico!

I am not a vegan, but I will go out if my way to eat here. Great food that is served quickly. Hot salsa is a mouth burner, but it is great!</Review>

<Review>Don't miss out on this VEGAN DELIGHT!! this place ROCKS!! try everything, possibly at the same time if needed as there is NOTHING on this menu that will not delight your senses. . Mejor Sabor!! Close to BART, easy access from freeways with a nice free parking lot. Check the hours or call ahead as sometimes their hours are a little limited ..

Excellent hand made vegan Mexican food!  I had the Hurache - medium salsa on the side.  My husband got the same but with hot sauce.  Whew! I!  So healthy and tasty.   Sadly a lot of homeless around the area.  I hope this place stays on for a long time.  Service is friendly too.</review>

<text>Service is not good. They keep screaming order numbers, so you can't have a conversation. The food is not bad, but not something to write home either. I got a stone in my salad :-( The inside is unsanitary and cramped. On a sunny day, you could sit outside.<//text><Rating>1< /Rating></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have been going to flacos for 6-7 years, when it was only a food stand at the farmers' market (the food stand still operates at the market, even after the restaurant opened). The food is so good, that we catered from this place for our wedding. I always send or take my friends there, and no one was ever disappointed. I like everything on the menu, but my favorite has to be the tamales. The flavors are exceptional!< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

Friendly staff and excellent food. It is also super close to Ashby bart so skip the car and bart and dont worry about parking or parking tickets. Who knew vegan Mexican food could be so good? Well apparently the folks and Flacos.<//Review>

If you're a vegan and you like Mexican food like me, you should try it.  My issue is, the food tasted great but was sloppily done. Sometimes vegan restaurants don't feel like they have to try because vegans have so few other options.  My dish had no diversity of texture.  It was just mush and it desperately needed some chips or a fried tortilla shell.  At the end you scrape your plates into a garbage bin in the parking lot.  The menu is a mess and lazy.  So to wrap up....tasty food poor execution.  Your call< /text>

Excellent food, affordable prices, ample portions, good vibes, friendly, knowledgeable staff. 100% vegan. Tasty authentic Mexican, vegan organic in addition to being so good! Food is as good as what you'd get eating in someone's home who is really good cook. We had tamales, of course, and their goodness rivaled that of my favorite Texas tamale offerings. The Taco plate was awesome as well. Used to be a food truck, & now they have a restaurant! Cool! One of my go to spots when visiting Cali's East Bay Area.
Tiny place, with more outside seating than in, which means takeout when the weather doesn't cooperate.
Enjoyed Flacos taquitos, black beans & rice at recent Vegan Soul Wellness Festival. And, yeah, they sold out before Festival ended, so missed out on banana leaf wrapped tamales, which Festival attendees raved about.<//Review>

A bit pricey for what you get. Love that it's totally vegan, but don't love the feel of the place, dark, dirty and cheap feeling. Food is good, not great.<//Text>

I wanted to give this place 4.5 stars, because I really really like this place a lot. The food is really good, the prices are decent, and the service is nice. I am a person who has a lot of dietary restrictions, so when I get eat more than two things on the menu at a place, I need to check it out. When I went, it became my favorite place to go. There are a lot of options (it is all vegan, with a lot of GF stuff). The only reason it doesn't get all of the stars is because you have to wait a while to get the food. To be fair to them, the  kitchen space is small, and they are pretty busy a lot of the time. However, the extra time for food is worth it.</review>

Found myself craving the crunchy taquitos after I had been there the first time so returned for more of the same plus a delicious banana leaf-wrapped tamale.   Food is very satisfying with very generous portions.</Text>

I could eat here every day.  The food is fresh, warm and organic.  I even pick up taquitos to go when I'm going to a party.  People love it!< /Text>

I got two kinds of tamale and a taquito to share with my toddler. Having never had a vegan tamale, he ate a whole one and then a second ( not the bean one, the other one). Salsa is perfect! I would eat here easily once a week if I lived nearby.<//Review>< Pics>

Super delicious and reasonably priced all-vegan fare. I highly recommend the taquitos and the huaraches (just remember to bring a friend to split the latter; it's a lot of food). Bonus points for being clean, friendly and using compostable to-go ware! Will be back again soon.< /text>

I am visiting from the southern midwest, and was excited to enjoy the healthier cuisines in San Francisco Bay area.  I was NOT disappointed with Flacos.  I had the Huarche with pinto beans topped with medium hot guacamole sauce, with a nice large cup of hot Horchata.  Absolutely delicious!  So many layers of flavor, and super fresh and tasty greens and cilantro generously garnished this yummy meal.  Super big portion too!  Took the other half to my friend who liked it as much as I did.  Oh, and wonderful friendly staff!  Thank you Flacos!<//Text>

I am normally pretty tolerant of even mediocre Mexican food, but after I had their Huarache I felt ill for the rest of the day. This dish was bland in an unpleasant way, and laid out like my 8-year-old was trying to make an 'artful' dish. The atmosphere of the establishment was run down and dreary. The two stars are for the friendly staff.< /review>

<text>The food is bland and the service is indifferent at best. They don't have ice water, the cups have a soapy aftertaste. Also, what kind of Mexican place doesn't serve burritos (also, I don't need attitude from the cashier for asking that question)? We had the Huaraches, which were served with radishes.

<Text>vegetarian Mexican food....Yeah I thought the same thing when I first heard about this place.  I have since taken two people there without telling them that is was vegetarian, and both asked me what kind of meat it was because it was great.  I love this place</Text>< Pics>

These tacos are spicy as all heck. Vegan mexican food seems like an oxymoron, but you will absolutely be disproved upon tasting flacos. I certainly wouldn't make a habit out of it, but for a one-off try something new scenario, you cannot go wrong.<//review>

So good! If you like spicey, they have a very tastey and very spicey green sauce (idk what it's called) and they serve vegan "meat" that is so good. Typical Mexican style menu but with a vegan twist and healthier options. Parking is limited to one teeny lot but its right next to bart or walking distance if you live near Ashby. Hardly any indoor seating but they have a patio with a decent amount of seating.< /review>

Cozy atmosphere, friendly staff and delicious food. What more could you ask for. We came here because...well who could resist trying vegan Mexican food? We had the taquitos, tomales and huarache. I really don't have anything bad to say about any of it. The taquitos were crispy and flavorful and perfect for dipping in their fresh made salsa. The vegan ground in tomales was seasoned perfectly. I didn't eat the huarache but the person who did said it was a very delicious salad on top of thick fluffy corn tortillas. Everyone was very satisfied and would love to come back again.<//Review>

My favorite restaurant. The tacos are the best but the taquitos are a close second.

If you're vegan and want to show off good vegan food to meat eaters, flacos is the place. My carnivorous friend chooses flacos taquitos over meat taquitos!< /review>

I visited these guys at the Tuesday South Berkeley Farmers Market. I tried the Soy/Gluten-Free Tamal made with Roasted Organic Chile Poblano, Organic Refried Pinto Beans, Organic Potatoes, Organic Corn Masa wrapped in a husk. The salsa was off the hook too. Have them mix their mild and spicy salsa for the right amount of kick!</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) Very bad service, I have years of buying and recommending cooks and chefs here for organic dough, for tamales and tortillas. Chic @ s no longer come here! Look for her at the Finca! From there they are supplied only call a day before. Los Flacos are the most unpunctual and liars, terrible service.
Very bad service, I used to buy organic dough for tortillas and tamales; also sent Chefs and Tamaleros here. Guys do not buy your Dough here, go to La Finca, call a day b4, Flacos very Open super late, lies, the worst service.

Muy mal servicio, tengo años en comprar y recomendar cocineros y chefs aqui x la masa orgánica, para tamales y tortillas. ¡ Chic@s ya no vengan aquí! ¡ busquenla en la Finca! de ahí se surten solamente llamen un día antes. Los Flacos son de lo más impuntuales y mentirosos, pésimos servicio.
