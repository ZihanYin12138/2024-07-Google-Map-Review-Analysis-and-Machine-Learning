Craftsman Dental has provided dental care for my family for years. Cindy cleaned my teeth today & did an amazing job with professionalism and great gentleness. Cindy too the time to answer all my questions and never made me feel rushed or hurried. Great work once again. Thank you Cindy!<//review>

Our family and a number of our friends were sad when our dentist retired but I am so happy to have had a referral to Craftsman Dental. Every aspect of the visit to the beautiful office is easy; as serene as they can make it and the staff is very welcoming and professional. I would, and have, recommended this practice without reservation.<//Text>

Probably the best dentist I ever had. I've been going here now for two or three years and always have an enjoyable experience. Today I went in for a cleaning and Hannah did an amazing job!  I'm sure she's new there because I hadn't seen her there in the past, what an amazing addition to the staff! Kudos to you Craftsman dental for bringing on this gem!!!😊😊😊♥️< /review>

<review>My experience with previous dental offices has been fairly corporate. You come in to get your cavities fixed, root canals done, and then you’re out. With Craftsman Dental Care, you get quality work done by a professional and very friendly staff that educates you on oral hygiene. This is not only beneficial in terms of health, but reduces the need for spending money on dental procedures later.</review>< Pics>

I've been a happy patient at Craftsman Dental for over 10 years. Dr. Shari, Dr. Fife, Melissa, Bree, and Amanda are THE BEST. The team continually provides outstanding customer service and impeccable work. I now live in San Francisco and won't trust anyone else with my teeth - they're well worth the drive. I've had cleanings, cavity fillings, TMJ issues, braces, and retainers all with successful outcomes through Craftsman Dental. They're knowledgeable and treat their customers with the utmost respect and care. Thank you all for your hard work and dedication.< /text>

I just had an appointment today in the middle of covid because I needed to be seen. The day before my appointment I received an email with their covid-19 instructions upon arrival. I was really impressed with their protocols and updates to the office not only to ensure patient safety and theirs, but to instill confidence and comfort. It was excellent, as with everything they do. Craftsman Dental is the best dental care I've ever had, they are really good people, and their staff makes it so easy by tracking  insurance coverages and costs. As long as they are in practice I will always go to Craftsman Dental.< /review>< pics>

I have been coming to Craftsman Dental for about 14 years now. Always great service and Dr. MIKE, Dr.Shari and all their staff treat my wife and I like family. Treatment like ours go beyond us. I notice a family like approach with all their patrons.

I highly recommend Craftsman Dental Care. I refer all my friends and family when I hear they are dissatisfied with their current provider. If you are looking for a new Dentist or Orthodontist, look no further and book an appointment today. They'd be glad to serve your dental needs

Thank you Craftsman Dental Care for all the years of Great American Service you have provided my bride and I. A truly honest business is hard to come by. You all are "Top Shelf" all the way.

When they heard of my discomfort, without hesitation, I was seen almost immediately. From my initial phone contact through the administrative and clinical steps, I experienced the epitome of care and professionalism from all staff members. My very short wait was in a beautiful and and warm waiting room, that made me feel like I was relaxing at home. Dr. Michael Fife and staff were personable, warm and thoroughly competent. They worked their magic and I was on my way in no time. I arrived with discomfort, departed with none and left feeling like I had just visited family. This team/clinic is clearly outstanding and highly recommended.  Here is something you don't often read in a dental review ......I can't wait to go back!< /text>< Response>

I highly recommend this dental office.  Dr. Mike and his staff have been so accommodating and kind regarding my anxiety surrounding dental work. The work they have done has been amazing. I had some issues with the dental work I had at my previous dentist, and I’ve never had those problems here. They have the skill needed to get the job done. As well as the staff is so friendly, kind and professional.

This may not be a requirement from a dental office, but an added bonus here is that the atmosphere is so relaxing. The decor, look, and feel of this office is so homey and relaxing. No more sterile cold dental offices for me. I can’t recommend this office enough for all your dental needs.< /Text>

The Fifes are great! It’s so hard to find a dentist that knows what they’re doing and has technical skills to match.

If you’re tired of dealing with dentists that graduated from some foreign country and are more concerned about charging you for add-on services rather than the quality of their work, I recommend giving these guys a try.</Text>

Nice and friendly staff! Haven’t had a chance to actually let them work on my teeth yet but they identified the problem I’ve had and referred me to an oral surgeon. Was suppose to pay 10% on my behalf for my visit but they have waived it! Feels like I’ve chosen the right place!</Review>

<Text>I have been a client of Craftsman Dental for about 20 years. These guys are awesome.
The office staff and dental assistants are kind, cheerful and efficient.
Dr Sherry is so sweet and skillful.
Dr Mike is the finest dentist I have ever had. He works quickly and confidently with sure hands.  I have never suffered any undue pain with him. He is amazing.
Last Saturday I suffered a small chip in a filling. They were able to see me the following Monday afternoon and Dr Mike repaired the damage. Wow.
Thanks You Guys!</Text>< pics>

Even though this Dental office did not accept my insurance they offered me a FREE exam and notes from that exam. All of the staff were very friendly and professional and the Dentist was very knowledgeable. I scheduled a follow-up appointment the same day which I am going to keep whether or not I have an insurance plan they accept. I was just that impressed!

This is my favorite dentist office that I have ever visited!  I've been seeing Dr Mike and Dr Shari since before they even opened the current practice, and I've never had anything other than a fantastic experience.

They select all of the office staff with the utmost care, and it really shows.  At every level they are friendly, attentive and awesome.  I honestly look forward to every one of my visits, as it always feels like visiting favorite family members.

Over the years, I continued to see them even during the period when I had switched to insurance that made them "out of network" as well as the period during which I had no insurance at all.  I never hesitated for a moment to come to THEIR practice, no matter what.

When I had a visiting friend with a dental emergency and no insurance, they did me a personal favor and got him in immediately, and even let me take responsibility for his bill with payments that I could manage.  THAT is what having a decades-long relationship and a great payment history with an AWESOME family dentist like the Fifes gets you.

If you're looking for a dentist, go see them. You won't regret it.</Text>

I was fit into an appt the same day as my initial call for help with a broken off tooth and scheduled me for a bridge replacement very quickly. The office is delightfully decorated with a warm cozy and festive motif and the staff all reflect that same feeling. The Dr. is a second generation dentist that seems super competent has a straightforward approach.  I’m happy about my new dental office!< /Review>

<review>They seem more interested in money than anything. I just left there after being billed for a full cleaning even though forgot to do the polishing, flossing, and rinse portion. They didn't even finish the scraping. And when I made the appointment initially they told me my first visit would only be 238.00 total, but then they charged another 113.00 for a cleaning they didn't even finish...< /review>< gmapID>

Dr. Mike and his team put me at ease when I felt like I was out of options for getting dental care that I needed. Previous dentists I tried felt like a nightmare, so I was afraid of dentist visits. But the Craftsman team took the time to help me feel much more comfortable and reassured. I have never had a better experience with a dentist than I did at Craftsman!  Their patience and caring is unmatched in my book! Thank you, thank you for the relief and the kindness extended to me.< /review>

Dr. Mike is one of those caregivers that leaves you thinking......"oh, my goodness, I hope this guy never retires!!!"  I totally get why this practice is called "Craftsman Dental."  Dr. Mike used the drill, mirror, explorer ---and I don't know what all--- to create crowns and sculpt their surfaces like a true craftsman.  My smile now looks like the one in the photo he requested I bring from 30 years ago.  And, I learned that good dentistry isn't complete without a fantastic lab where the molds get sent.  The lab that Dr. Mike trusts produced a fine set of teeth for me! The color, the shape, the thickness, the material...holy cow...I'm so happy with the outcome!</review>

Staff is great, wait time is short! I was impressed with the assistant comforting me while I got numbed, during the wait time while the numbing takes effect the Dr. actually stayed in the room and talked to us, didn’t run off and I had a filling from a prior doctor that was rough and the Dr. smoothed it for me no charge. Well run practice with good, skilled people.< /Review>

<Review>I've been going to Craftsman Dental Care for nearly 20 years.  I've experienced nothing but excellent work , friendly, thoughtful service.

I have been going to Craftsman Dental for several years now, and have had extensive dental work. Not once in all the times I have been to the office have I had a bad experience. The office is beautifully appointed and the staff are super friendly and knowledgeable. My teeth are in the best shape of my life thanks to everyone at Craftsman Dental.<//text>

< Review>
I was a horrible Dental Chicken until I came here.  They have changed how I feel about dental work by making me comfortable and worked with me in stages which helped emotionally and financially.  Got it all done and I see the importance of dental health over fear. The staff here are more like family and is a family business.  I've been going here for years, maybe a decade and have never had a bad experience.  How many people can say that about their dentist?<//Review>

< Review>
I wouldn't dream of going to any other dentists other Craftsman Dental Care. Dr. Shari and Dr. Mike are the most caring, gentle, thorough dentists I've ever had the pleasure to go to.  The office staff are just as great. DeAnna is warm and friendly all while being very professional and helpful with insurance and reminders that I never have to worry about a thing. I started going to the Drs. Fife over 10 years ago and my whole family left their dentists and followed me over to get the great same experience at Craftsman Dental Care.< /Review>

I've been a patient of Drs Mike and Shari Fife for more than ten years and now, going to the dentist is like visiting friends! They are professional, caring and friendly and I highly recommend Craftsman Dental Care.

<Review>It’s a good place to start your day with fresh juice & natural sandwich as breakfast. They have a lot of options for natural sandwiches: Ham & Egg, Turkey & Cheese, Salami & Tomato, Ham & Avocado, etc. For drinking: lemonade & honey with pineapple or raspberry, and more options. The store is clean, the staff is kind and the prices are great! They really have good options to have a picnic in front of The Painted Ladies. It’s perfect!!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

PBJs are delicious, the jam is super fresh and they use this thick cinnamon swirl toast 🤤 Delightful. That’s all I tried, but the place is adorable and seemed to be reasonably priced. Be aware that it’s cash only though, nearest ATM is a few blocks down at the hospital.< /review>

Miss it all the time now that I'm not in the area any more! Prepared food made fresh daily and even made up as you wait if something you're looking for isn't available! For me it was the great bagel combos!!< /Review>

<Review>Great place to grab grub. I really do like this place, except for the poor attitudes from the staff. Sandwiches and juices are good and priced right, but everything else is kinda overpriced....especially the stuff they bag themselves...4 oreos for a dollar? there's like 50 in a package for $4, so they are basically charging $13 for a box of fake oreos. I still like this place, just be careful what you buy. Oh yeah...cash only...which is a pain in the butt</Review>< Date>

If you don't love Courtney, then we really couldn't be friends.  Everything about this place is magical, a serious weight lifts off my shoulders when I walk in. So good, so cheap, the people so nice. The pbj sandos are staggering.

Last night I got really drunk and considered getting a tattoo inspired by Courtney. And I still want it 24 hours later. Courtney has changed my life. Thank you Courtney.</review>

They also have a great selection of fruit: If I haven't been to the farmer's market recently I can always find something in season that's ripe and tasty.  It's pretty cheap and frequented by all sorts: people who live nearby, staff of the nearby hospital, parents and teachers from the school across the road, and tourists making their way between The Haight and The Castro.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Review>This is a lovely little metaphysical shop! The service is wonderful, and the clerk was welcoming and happily showed us around and answered any questions. There’s a wide variety of nicely organized gemstones to choose from, singing bowls, spiritual statues, basically anything you’d look for in this type of shop! I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone looking for metaphysical materials.</Review>< Date>

Right away walking into the store, I automatically felt the amazing pure energy! Everything is extremely loving and sacred. Bhumi was absolutely thoughtful and even told my girlfriend and I a little story about the singing bowls. I purchased one of course! I got so many blessings to take home with me today! I am definitely coming back! This place is AWESOME! Namaste <3 You are all loved; we are all one! :-)</text>

The store had a huge selection to choose from with information provided. Maria is extremely helpful and knowledgeable with the store’s products.

This store has amazing energy and a lot of different types of gems and crystals available. Ashish was so knowledgeable and helpful and allowed my friend and I to use a palo santo to cleanse the crystals that we purchased. I would definitely visit again when I am back in town. Sana sana!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Wow! What incredible customer service! Thank you Ashish for being so incredibly helpful and generous with your time. My coworker got in a car accident while visiting Palm Springs during quarantine, and Ashish not only helped me pick out healing candles, crystals, a book and journal and card over the phone, but he actually offered to drive it to the hospital and declined a personal tip. So much gratitude for you Ashish and for this inspiring gift store! I hope to visit in person.< /review>< Pictures>

Earth elements is a wonderful store with many tools to guide your path. Bhumi one of the employs was knowledgeable and assisted me in all my questions. Definitely recommend to everyone curious or looking for additions in their crystal and or sing bowl tool kit.<//Review>

I loved this store, it has a very calming vibe. It has lots of options of stones and the explanation of what each stone does, it also has a big section of candles, essential oil, and special kit to do energy cleaning.

I loved it, def will come back soon<//Text>

I just went into this store and fell in love. I’m coming from LA. There are not a lot of crystal stores in LA and if there are, their selections and prices are not as good as Earth Elements. I can’t wait to purchase more. Great customer service too, so friendly!</Review>

I immediately felt a calming feeling stepping into the store. They carry really beautiful stones, jewelry, and informational pamphlets. This is my second time and it won’t be my last!</Text>

<review>I’m a Beaumont local and I frequent palms springs trips because it’s close. One of the must see’s stores I always make time for is Earth Elements. No matter who is working or I always receive a genuine, transformative experience. It’s the next place to come for an open minded energy and welcoming vibe.

I'm Deidra and I'm writing about the Earths Elements Wellness hemp oil! I'm a type 2 diabetic living with constant pain and stomach issues due to medications and stresses in my daily life. It was suggested by colleagues to try cbd oil. My husband was downtown one day and stopped into this establishment. He was given the suggestion for me to try the mint flavored oil. I began taking it every morning before going into work and immediately felt a difference. If I go without this product for a day or 2, I'm back to feeling yucky!!! I had Hubby go back today, trying the lemon ginger flavor this time. There are also a coconut oil and olive oil kind available. I can't thank Earths Elements enough for the kindness shared with my husband!</Text>

My dog Noah (Blk Lb Mx) 10 yrs old....is a super sweet dog, but when around new people and other dogs is very shy and the anxious (shows his teeth) type. My expereince with other Vets has never been really that good as far as Noah feeling at ease (himself).

But this time with Whole Pet Vet (particularly with Corin (one of the nurse techs) -he trusted her....hope i spelled that right), he was totally fine. How do I know? He was able to do acupuncture for 20 mins. Meaning he at ease enough to let people put needles in him! Obviously during the pandemic I couldn't go in and see for myself, but I could have asked them to take a picture, of which I probably would ask for the next time I go...But in any case, just through talking with the staff and the doctor, I feel like to could sense good people.

Megan was really helpful. She's one of the nurse techs I believe. But she knew a lot, communicated really well the information I needed for his meds and for all future appts, and was easy going and genuine . Talked slow, clear, and was patient.

Dr. Krimsley was the doctor/accupunctist I was appointed. She was cool. She was very willing to work with my anxious/difficult dog. And that goes a long way.

4 stars because this is only our first visit.

Thanks for being different and helping us out a LOT,

Scott<//Text>

I've been going to The Whole Pet Vet for more than a decade and they are great! I appreciate their holistic approach. All of staff I've worked with have been incredibly gentle and respectful of my dog and cats, and the office manager even helped us save 6 newborn kittens! Everyone is knowledgeable and professional, and the facility is clean but doesn't have that 'vet smell'.
The only down side is that it can be pricey, but I think it's worth it.< /Text>

This place is hands down the best vet I have been to over the years. My dogs actually enjoy going there. Dr. Sur and all the vet techs are incredible. Huge shout out also to Jasmine and Dee at the front desk for always being kind and amazing too. I highly recommend this vet as they treat issues both medically and holistically. Coming initially from banfield and some other private vets over the years, the whole pet vet is simply the best.<//text>

Great vet. Competent, licensed professionals. I always feel my dog is in good hands. The office staff are also very helpful. They went out of their way to help make sure my labradoodle got in for a non-anesthetic dental cleaning, which went really well! I highly recommend.</review>

<text>I was super nervous about taking my dog to the vet office, but when my dog suffered from UTI I couldn't ignore it.  I made an appointment and went into another office the week before and had horrible experience.  I made an appointment with Dr. Lee, and she was highly compassionate and great with my dog.  The staff was also great even though my dog pooped in the middle of the lobby after smelling around.  I was pretty mortified, but they were very understanding.  Dr. Lee knew I wanted more holistic and conservative treatments so she gave me plenty of time to make my decision on care, and we opted for x-rays and herbs to dissolve the bladder stones.  We also chose some grooming, because his fur was so matted.  I had no idea my papillon-pomeranian could look so good!  He was fluffy!  My dog did really well on the herb, and he had no problem after starting on the herbs.  Thank you, Dr. Lee!  I highly recommend her and the office.< /text>< response>

<text>Horrible experience- my lab was diagnosed w aggressive cancer by Great Vet Los Gatos Fog and Cat hospital and and a huge mass was removed at Sage  hospital on an emergency from her stomach- now we need to figure out this difficult journey from here in—
I had taken our lab, to this place a few years ago -so I went in person and made an appointment 10 days ago to have her seen and have alternative ways to treat /Shasta, my lab- today at 8:40 am I get a text to confirm the appointment, at 3:20 I get a call to confirm the appointment which we have been waiting for for 10 days -
3:27 pm today another message is left that my appointment is changed to noon tomorrow—-
So I call to ask about taking lab tests in and I find out that they cancelled my appointment !!!!
It is 6 pm when I call them, less than 3 hours after they confirm my apointment...,
They say they called again and cancelled it!!!
When I said is not  the case, which  doctor  or hospital you have seen that confirms 3 times in the same day before appointment and then they cancel on a dog cancer ;(:(  the lady says oh!! maybe they called the wrong number and left a message on the wrong number!!!
I am shocked of the unprofessionalism and lack of care —it is unacceptable and unethical !!
Then she says they don t have a doctor available !!! But seem like they did when they Confirmed my appointment 3 times - but suddenly they don t !!
With an urgent need, they proceed to tell me their next available is August 12 th - in two more weeks !!! when  they chose to cancel the appintment the day before !!!!!!
If you have a pet that needs real care, I would not count on this place - I saw a lot of good reviews and some are from years ago but that is not at all my experience today
The staff kept repeating the same thing which did not make sense at all !my dog is 10 years old and I have been to different vets over the years and all have been good except this one. They only reason I came here was to go everything I can for my dog, alternative treatment which they said they have !!!the only reason
I have records of the calls and their written transcription of messages left and the lists of my incoming calls / I have proof of their lie - not sure at all how the vet is who I was supposed to see and decided not to show or get a replacement, but if it is anything like the staff manager who chose to cancel and had no apology or regret it for doing so and lied on top of it - then .... oh boy!!!
So sad to count on and wait for 10 days for dog w aggressive cancer to see a vet and have the appointment cancelled the day before and they don t even tell you they cancelled it and you find out because you call the find out how to transfer the test results their
Unreliable and unprofessional !!!
We wasted 10 days when I could have made an appointment w reliable vet instead ...

<text>Our dog had a close call with pancreatitis.  We knew we wanted her to be carefully monitored and treated in a way that would prevent a future attack.  The comprehensive testing and diet analysis was far more comprehensive than we would have received from our neighborhood vet.  Every supplement they have prescribed has made a lot of sense.  If your dog has a special condition, I would highly recommend this clinic.< /text><rate>5</rate>< pics>

<Gmap_id>0x808e35f24ebda2d7:0x6dae994b522e2c7f<//Gmap_id><Review>I was very disappointed with my experience here several years ago with my dog.  Before moving to California, I was fortunate to have the services of an incredible and caring holistic vet in Illinois.  She would examine my dog thoroughly before giving the acupuncture treatment.  At this hospital, the doctor came in, read that my dog had bad arthritis, put the needles in, and left.  I eventually just quit going.  Waste of time and money.</Review><Date>1502403160686<//Date><user_id>117610309927495205346< /user_id>< resp>
{'time': 1502730022470, 'text': "Hi Beverly,\n\nWe are so sorry to hear that you were disappointed in the care that Tess received with us. It looks like we haven't seen Tess since January of 2014, and at the time of her last appointment with us, your feedback was that she seemed to be more comfortable and you felt she was improving with the acupuncture and other treatments being administered (including supplements and Adequan). Tess did receive a full physical exam at the time of her initial acupuncture consultation and treatment. She then had six additional acupuncture treatments with us over the course of the next 6 months. She was also seen for adequan injections and lab work. We typically repeat a full physical exam every six months, and/or if any new concerns arise or we feel the treatments are no longer effective. We always welcome feedback regarding the care we provide, and encourage our clients to contact us directly with any concerns. We wish all the best to you and Tess."}< /resp>

Very kind and knowledgeable staff. Sometimes they try to sell you supplements at exorbitant prices, but you can always decline and buy elsewhere. All the vets here are excellent.</Review>

I don’t normally post reviews but home boy helped me out today. I think he was the manager, not sure.  Anyways, got some new boots for work. I’m excited to break them in and when I destroy them, like I usually do, I’ll be back for more!  Friendly amazing service and very knowledgeable. Super into it.<//review>

Easy access and parking. This is one of their smaller stores compared to others we've been to. It's hard being such a common size and never having your size in stock.</Text>

Walked in and one if the employees/owner was on the phone talking about the fire marshal and how they need to pass a code for something. I don't know if this was business related or not but it was very unprofessional and it prompted another employee to ask if I needed something. Prices were definitely MSRP so I just ordered it on Amazon instead.<//review>

Wish I remember the name of the man who helped me, but man he was great!!! I'm required to wear steel toe boots now at work, this is the third place I went to and this man was very knowledgeable on all the steel toe boots they had, and helped me choose the right pair!!! I'm very happy with how comfy the boots were today at work and how helpful and friendly this man was! It made me want to buy more stuff lol so I got nice new pair of gloves and pack of socks... $240 bucks later, I felt no problem spending that!!! Defently coming back!!!!<//review>

<Text>Bought a pair of work boots from them, and had the shoe laces break within 48 hours. I brought my shoes and came in with my receipt, and they would not replace the laces, even though it had not even been 2 days. They lost my business forever over some laces.< /Text>< UserId.>

No selection of women's shop wear.  There is a token corner dedicated to scrubs and a few girl colored shirts. There was only one Carhartt brand item in women's sizes, a pink hoodie.  Even in men's, there was not a small to be found.  I would love to give my business to a local brick and mortar store. Their men's selection is extensive and their employees are great, but there is nothing for me here.</text>

Decent selection of Carhart gear. Lots of high-vis stuff. I came in for some safety vests and found much nicer ones than what I have been buying at Home Depot and Walmart for not much more money.< /Review>

I had an appointment. I showed up about 30 minutes early. Instead of making me wait, they took my truck immediately. Even though they have a full day, they got me finished before the time of my actual appointment.
Great job guys. Very kind and professional. Each of the mechanics that I ran into were very nice and helpful...

I love the fact that the owner actually reads the reviews. Great job guys. Keep it up. Will be back if I have the need... 👍<//text>

Alot of place want to try and tell you to spend the max amount of money for what needs to be done or waste your time with this and that, they were straight up and very thorough with everything that had to be done now and what could wait until later. They sent me a link to the entire test to see pictures and everything and walked me through all my questions and didn't make me feel stupid or rushed even though they were extremely busy. They even gave me a ride home. 100% recommend and I will be back. Thanks again.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

I’ve been coming here for 3 years, 3 different vehicles worked on. Great quality every time, and really sweet employees. Overall a super stand-up place to trust with your vehicle. They went above and beyond to make sure my car could be finished in time, as I was going out of town this week I ran into car trouble. Will always come back here!</text>

These guys are awesome I drive from Redding to get my car serviced because they know what they're doing ,they are honest whether they make money from you or not they will tell you the truth about your car truck or whatever you bring. They are efficient they obviously care about their customers, I have been to a lot of different mechanics in my lifetime and these guys I trust I will recommend them to anyone. They send you pictures with diagnosis, and explain the issues, health,  and repairs your vehicle needs so you can clearly see and understand what work needs to be done!! I am huge on reviews because us customers have to rely on them, its our hard money we don't want to waste it! Good job Anderson automotive!!< /text>

Everyone there was courteous and friendly. Brandon helped and kept me updated on the progress. They supplied me with a loner car. I was impressed with the way they sent photos and complete information on what did or did not need immediate attention.

I will definitely recommend Anderson Automotive to everyone I know as I believe I finally found my automotive repair home.
Thanks

Anderson auto went over and beyond , our breaks went out in a car we bought in Sept they did. Full inspection took photos and explained everything to us verbally and in writing. They even lent us a lender car while our car was being repaired. We will recommend Anderson Auto to our friends , family and people we don't know as well. Thank you for everything.</text>

Google for the best rated auto repair near me since we just moved to the area. From the first friendly conversation to the pick up of my repaired car, Brandy and Brandon were professional, friendly and easy to work with. The mechanic ( sorry forgot his name) took me out and showed me the problems , explained  , advised and Never pressured me.
I recommend Anderson Auto.<//Text>

You know somewhere does amazing work when then have amazing employees.  Everyone was super easy to talk to.  Overhearing them talk to customers with issues, they were genuine and worked had to make sure they were happy.   While I only came in for the oil change and hope I don’t have auto trouble I’m the coming days, I know now I have a place to go if I do.  Thank you Anderson Auto.  You all are wonderful.

Anderson Automotive is wonderful! Friendly staff, both on the phone and in person. They seem extremely knowledgeable and communicate their findings on what your car needs without any "pressure". I felt very comfortable bringing 2 different vehicles to them for smog tests and other repairs.< /Review>

Low beams for headlights went out(both). Back passenger light wouldn't go off, thought it was an electrical problem so took it into the shop and had them take a look. Granddaughter, 3yrs old, had turned a nob witch kept that light on. Both low beam bulbs went out at same time.  Thanks to all of you and God bless.  🤗💖👍🏻🙏</Review>

They take care of their customers. A few weeks after my car was worked on, heard a rattling noise coming from under the hood. Contacted Nicole, and she told me to bring it in the next day. They handled the issue promptly. Very good service.<//Review>

New to area, had sensor light come on. Dropped by early in the morning without an appointment and they were able to get vehicle in to look at and take care of. Great staff, pleasant waiting area and clean shop. Love the follow-up from them a week later to make sure everything is running fine. Great experience.< /text>

<text>Rolled into the shop around 3:30 as the rear wheel bearing kicked the bucket.  We had about 700 miles to go to get home and thought we might have to spend the night waiting for repairs.  Fortunately we were back on the road before 5pm.
Can’t thank you all enough!  Especially the mechanic who was totally familiar with my vehicle having owned the same one!

Thank you one and all</text>< Response>

First, let me start off by saying the vehicle came in with a check engine light code for low voltage and the alternator that you had installed 6 months earlier had failed, we had one of our technicians do the testing necessary to diagnose the alternator problem and he found it was not charging and causing the check engine light. We also noted your left front wheel bearing making noise. That is when we called you and informed you of everything going on (the next day from you dropping it off at 8:32am according to our records) and gave you a price on everything in which you approved, which included both front wheel bearings and a quality alternator, we would NEVER  do repairs to a vehicle without prior authorization from the vehicles owner, if the bill goes up by $20 from what we quoted, we call. It is not our vehicle or our money so we do not ever make that decision. Also it is a California LAW. I’m unsure of why you claim we did anything without your authorization, because not only do I have documentation (date,time,who we talked to etc) you in your own review above,claim you asked for your parts back after completion of repairs ahead of time, I’m unsure how you can ask for parts to be returned on a repair you did not authorize. When you picked the vehicle up we did drop the ball on returning your alternator because there is a “core” which means we need to return it to the supplier, my technician accidentally returned the core, which was 100% our mistake which is why I refunded you the complete price of the alternator($505) As far as the check engine light upon pickup, because the alternator was not charging we could not see the other underlying codes in the system, you had an unrelated oxygen sensor code, but being that as I stated I really do not like to have anyone leave unsatisfied we replaced your front oxygen sensor completely free of charge to you. Again I’m sorry you are dissatisfied with us, and if I can do anything else, please let me know\n\nNick Jones\n365-6838\nNick@andersonsmog.com'}< /resp>< Text>
I chose going to Anderson Automotive as they were local, I like to
support small, home town businesses and they had a lot of good reviews
on Google. Now I find them as flat out LIES!

They charged me $120 an hour when the sign on the wall stated $109.56,
this in my opinion is not good business.

Marking up needed parts astronomically is sheer robbery, I was charged
$505.23 for a new alternator, directly from Ford they are only $238.
They charged me $400.90 for front wheel bearings and seals. Again from
Ford they only $53.44 (each). These costs were not cleared ahead of
completion, given the high cost of parts I feel this is something that
should have gotten approval.

I asked ahead of time for my faulty parts as so I could return them,
they were not in the car when I picked it and have yet to be located,
is a poor business practice.

When I picked up the car the check engine light was still on I
returned immediately for them to clear the code and was told that if it
appeared again to come back next week, it was only able to go a short
before coming back on.

Not completing the needed repairs and being told to just drive the car
over the weekend seems very unprofessional.  I am hoping to get this
resolved in short time.

I will NEVER do business with Anderson Automotive again and
will tell my friends and family NOT to do business either.<//Text>

I was informed of a couple brewing issues relating to my older Subaru which I appreciated being informed of before getting too much worse.
Anderson Automotive is reasonably and fairly priced, and I was told they warranty everything  for a generous period of time (I can't state the exact cuz I don't want to misquote them), and they provide one of their loaner cars if yours will be in the shop for an extended time.
I was a first-time customer and was very pleased with their services.  I will become a regular customer from here on out!< /Review>< gmapID>

I was visiting from Utah and my power steering had stopped working. First of all, they quoted me 1400$ for a new power steering pump. First of all, I think that it's very unethical to put a new part on a 16 year old vehicle. Then they said that for a refurbished part would be 800$: the same price as the dealer. They said that they would change the power steering pump, the low pressure hose, and the reservoir. Turns out all they did was change the power steering pump because everything else was "fine." I picked it up and it started leaking immediately.  The nice thing they did was tow it from where it was and replace the reservoir for free so I could have it to drive back home before the holiday. That seemed to work!!! Except that it didn't. As soon as I got home it started leaking all over the driveway!!!  They had also diagnosed a myriad of problems including "broken" motor mounts, a SEVERE oil leak, and a low battery. All of these thing we're confirmed as being COMPLETELY UNTRUE!!!!!!
I feel completely swindled by them!!!
Sorry Nick, you and your guys need to practise doing the job right the first time, stop overcharging, and stop lying to your customers!</Review>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1578965007258, 'text': "Hi Sarah this is Nick, Im sorry you feel this way about your visit here. ID love to chat with you about this to better explain/understand what happened and take care of any issues you may have. It seems last we talked you were having a leaking issue and we explained if it was something we did we would take care of it under our 3 year 36000 mile warranty, but we never received anymore info. We did indeed just replace the pump on the Honda for 639 dollars including labor and diagnostics, because of your concern over price and the fact that you were from out of the area and it was New Year’s Eve we did try and reuse your reservoir, unfortunately it did need replacing like we originally recommended which is why we towed the vehicle back to our shop and I personally stayed late, sourced a reservoir(made a special trip to get it) and installed it so you could leave that day around 7pm. We have a full digital inspection of your vehicle with all the issues we found and would be glad to go over it with you. Informing you of issues on your vehicle can sometimes be alarming but knowing you are from out of town and didn’t have time for anything other than what we did, I’m not sure how informing you of the issues with your vehicle could be construed as “dishonest” These hondas are very common for bad engine mounts and need to be checked properly, the technician that worked on your vehicle worked in a honda dealer for over 15 years and although we are all human Im very confident in his abilities. I'm sad to hear this is how you felt but I would be glad to stand behind anything we did, and or recommended. Thanks Nick\nNick@andersonsmog.com\n530-365-6838"}< /response><gmap_id>0x54d2c165f6856fdd:0x931283ff41cf31ff< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I will never take my vehicle to another shop again and recommend Nick, Ryan and the other guys to anyone that has any repairs that need to be done!!</review>< user>

<review>I have been a customer of Anderson Automotive for over 20 years. They are thorough, HONEST, and affordable. I learned along time ago if you want paint go to a paint store. If you need a hardware question answered go to a hardware store. If  you need maintenance or have a issue with your vehicle GO to Anderson Automotive. You will get professional service and they do stand behind their work.[Remember that maintenance dollars are the cheapest dollars you will spend.]</review>< Gmap_id>

Exceptional service. Everyone there was great. Made me feel very welcome the minute I walked in the door.
That was indeed the fastest smog check my "Sammy Silverado" had ever gone through. I will most definitely be a repeat customer.  Highly recommend!< /text>

Useless Yelp never posted my review!! I love Anderson Automotive, because I worked and saved VERY hard to get my newer (used) car, and I feel like they care about keeping it in good shape as much as I do. I HIGHLY recommend them for any used car purchase inspections. They did mine after my purchase through Carvana, they caught things that the Carvana inspectors missed. They then worked with the Carvana service team to get my repair done. They check in with me to make sure my car is still running well, and everything is good. Unlike some shops, they don't upsell me on things. They straight advised me on what standard maintenance I had to do now (Carvana doesn't do presale maintenance), and what can wait until later. And the pricing...off the chart amazing!! They are a fraction of what other shops have charged me.<//Text>

First met Nick when we moved up from the Bay Area in June of 2015. We have had him service our 2 vehicles and keep them on the road for us. Super great guy and have recommended him to many of our new friends in the area. He is honest and his prices are amazing. He will only tell you what needs to be fixed and doesn't try to get you to fix something that is not needed. He stands behind his warranties and I can leave his shop and know I am not being taken advantage of. I trust him. I have lots of stories with my experience with Anderson Automotive and they have all been good experiences. Nick you are the best!< /text>

<Text>I just purchased a used vehicle and took it to Anderson Automotive to have them go through it with a fine tooth comb and identify any issues. They were booked up but squeezed me in at the beginning of the next week. My back brakes were shot (I knew this coming in) so I had them replace the rear brakes and rotors. The engine was making a popping sound and they found out it was just a loose bolt. It also needed an oil change, engine air filter, new wipers (replaced them with Rain-X ones) and it had a front differential axel leak. The big issue was a broken motor mount, which they fixed. They quoted $120 up front for a test drive & they did a 45 point inspection free. It identified these issues as well as upcoming Maintenance needs. They sent me the inspection report (with pictures) and I had them perform most of the repairs & maintenance. The final total came in a little under their updated quote and they gave me discounts from two coupons and a discount for paying in cash. The vehicle sounds and runs so much better now. They are very informative, drove me home and picked me back up when it was done in a very nice van (they have a loaner cars too, if needed).
Overall, they run their shop like a dealership shop but with the costs of a little ma & pa shop. I would recommend them to anyone that needs to get their vehicle fixed or maintained over taking it to your dealership.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1578965280284, 'text': 'Thanks Tracey!

This was my first time going to this shop as I am new to the area. I was quite apprehensive after being burned a couple of times at some other places in the Bay area.
These guys made me feel at ease and are very professional, social, respectful and take the time to really explain things in layman
terms. The inspections are documented online and the items
inspected are photographed to show you what they see. They also told me some things that needed to be
addressed in the future for repairs as well. Needless to say,
I was very impressed and will be  returning customer.< /Text>

<text>I remember.now. This auto shop didn't sell car but repaired them. I remember now because they had an elderly woman I am friends with bring her car in 3 different times for smog and they kept falling it at 85 dallars a pop. I brought her car to a shop I know in redding and it passed the first time. I told them what had been going on to which they said strange we didn't see anything wrong.<//text>< Name>

It took a little bit to get my car done but they were short handed today. They are all very nice and very informative. I used a coupon I recieved in the mail for an oil change. Made an appointment then had to change it. They were very accommodating. I would go back.</Review>

The shift cable had popped off due to the shift lever on the transmission being rusted nearly in half and the bushing in the cable being worn from the rust(we sent you pictures of this concern) Under normal operation shift cables do not pop off. The reason we had the Jeep Liberty for a week was due to availability of the shift cable, and lever through Chrysler. Unfortunately due to the large amount of rust on the Jeep we encountered issues in the very beginning steps of replacing both the shift cable and the lever it attached too.  Which is why I called you before we got into a situation that we could not come back from. I know this may not be pleasant but your Jeep had serious rust issues and unfortunately it made the job that much more labor intensive. We gave you the option of not going forward with the repair and not owing anything due to the unforeseen circumstances. And also provided a free oil change for the hassle. I apologize this repair did not go as planned and I really wish there was something we could do. Sorry again and if you have any questions give me a call at 530-365-6838.UPDATE -glad we could chat on the phone and I hope after talking you had a better understanding of what transpired.

What a great experience. I worried about finding an honest and affordable mechanic, and am so happy I found Anderson Automotive. Not only did they not try to "sell" me on work that didn't need to be done, they took pictures of what did need to be done and provided detailed information on each item.  They were able to squeeze me in the morning I called, and my car was fixed in a matter of hours. A big thank you to Nick and his team!</Review>

<text>These guys are great.  My family and I were stranded on I-5, and had the car towed here after reading the reviews.  We left the car there on a Sunday, continued on our trip in a rental, communicated via phone with the shop, and picked it up on the way back through town a week later.  They were super professional, prompt, knowledgeable, and nice guys on top of all that.  Price seemed pretty reasonable given the major repairs involved.  Highly recommended!</text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They got me in on time and out in less time then they said. The staff was polite (as usual), and the price was what they said it would be. This is the only shop that has never made me feel like I am being taken advantage of. I will continue to take my vehicle there as long as I am living in Shasta County!!!

Great experience, friendly, great work and knowledgeable. My mechanic I greatly respected and trusted for the last 15 years closed his shop. I was worried about finding another trustworthy mechanic, by a reference I went down and had some work done and now I have a new auto shop I'm confident and comfortable with and trust. Anderson Automotive has another happy customer.<//text>

<review>I came in with a check engine light, on my VW. Unfortunately, they don't work on VWs. However, Ryan offered to check the code on my engine light, helped me diagnose the simple issue (a broken seal on my gas cap), and told me how to fix it myself. I came back five minutes later and he cleared the code for me. Didnt charge me a penny. Excellent service.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1569521186773, 'text': 'Thanks Gabriel!

They make it so easy!! Due to my husbands work schedule I had to bring my car in for a smog, by myself. Anderson Automotive made it so painless! I was able to use the website to text in my request and set the appointment. The smog price was the lowest we found. My car was done quickly. They didnt give me an expensive list of things that needed to be fixed.  And they texted me a link to my car's profile showing actual pictures they took of my car while they were working on it! That makes it super easy for anything else we need to have done because now they have a record of the car< /review>

My girlfriend took her van here to have it smogged. Piece of vacume hose was cracked, told her it was a dealer part. She calls the dealer, forwards me an email and from what we were told,  we assume the part was indeed a dealer only part. Charged her $80 bucks to replace $5 bucks worth of vacume line. Hours after she leaves there the shift linkage bushing mysteriously pops off and she is stranded. So I ended up paying $80 for a $5 chunk of vacume hose, plus I get to replace the linkage bushing ($30 shipped) and had to leave work early.
They justified the $80 to both her and I, by saying it was in a tight spot around the back of the engine. Then when I get the call she is stranded, I find that the hose isn't in a tight spot. It is right on top of the motor. She called to ask about the shift linkage and they change thier story, now they say the hose was right on top of the engine and they were no where near the shift linkage. They flat out lied to gouge my lady, then lie to get out of fixing something they broke. Didn't care if thier lies contradicted one another, because at that point they had got her money, and my bet is they were trying to get her for more on the shift linkage.<//Review>

{'time': 1545109599252, 'text': 'Hey Caleb this is Nick the owner, I was the one who performed the smog check on the van, I know Amanda has been coming here for some time and I would hope that she would know we are in no way “gouging” as we have never done to her before over the many services we have performed. The evaporative emissions purge line was broken on top of the motor, which we did replace with bulk vacuum line,the 80 dollars included the repairs, the initial smog and the resmog after the repair, I am unsure of why you had issues with the shifter linkage after the smog, as the line is no where near the shift linkage. We have no problem taking care of anything if we caused an issue, and if you truly feel wronged I have no problem refunding you. I have no intention of “price gouging” anyone. Unfortunately the California smog program is not always customer friendly. Like I said I truly apologize if you feel wronged. If you have any further questions give me a call at 365-6838 thanks'}</Resp>

<text>My husband and I recently took our van to Anderson Automotive for a smog test and after inspection we found out we needed a lot of repairs. We received detailed pictures and evaluations right away. Nick gave us an estimate and kept in communication while the repairs were being worked on. Nick even stayed after hours to make sure he completed the job and get our van back to working order. This was a huge positive as lacking a car was stressful, and we are grateful to get it back soon, and fixed. We highly appreciate nicks honest, upfront detailed approach to business. We will definitely be taking our business back to him in the future. Thank you Anderson Automotive.<//text>< Pics>

<Response>{'time': 1571805704227, 'text': 'Hi Alex, Sorry about that, unfortunately as much as we like to have self accountability, this one is on the state of California, they have made the machine that smogs older (1999 and older) vehicles very expensive. It is no longer feasible for us to afford this machine with the amount of smogs we do. We do our best to be a one stop shop, but in this case it just doesn’t make sense. We should have made a recommendation to you to a smog shop that does smog older vehicles that we recommend. If you need anything else on your vehicle let us know, I’m sure if you did business with us you would be satisfied. Unfortunately having not done any business with us at all I can’t do much in the way of making this right.\n\nThanks, Nick'}<//Response>< gmapID>

< Review>
Salon is always clean! And the staff is very friendly. So far I've had 2 sets done twice and 2 pedicures. Danny us very detailed and I didn't get the name of the gentleman who did my nails today but he was also very detailed and quick! Him and Amy are the Perfect combo. She did my toes and is very pleasant and caring for my comfort. Heads up, they are only taking online payments like Zelle and Venmo<//Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>Absolutely my worst experience at a nail shop! I will not return to this location. I had an appointment for 3 at 4p.m. We were there for 26 minutes before 2 of us received a chair. My other daughter waited almost an hour and a half. My daughters nail tech then proceeded to take a lunch before starting my daughters nails, after she kept stopping and texting someone, 15 minutes later she had an appointment arrive and someone else took over her nails. I asked for a design that was not difficult, just blue and gold to match my dress. My tech oh no gel polish chips, powder is better. I can't do your design but I have good design for you. She literally kept pushing it. I was talked about in another language almost the entire time. She showed me an amazing picture of some she did. Mine turned out awful!!! I cried, that awful. They were extremely busy and nail polish left on my fingers, lumps in a couple nails. My other daughter was lucky she liked hers. 3 hours later the receptionist was the only one with customer service skills who was able to make me feel not totally disrespected. I still paid but was given a 20% discount off of an awful $85 nail design.</Review>< Pictures>

I've been coming to Stacy for 3months now for my eyebrow wax, eyebrow tint & lashes. She does an amazing job each time and they look natural. Hands down to the young ladies at the front desk, considering how busy it gets their always trying to accommodate everyone's needs. Thank you Stacy & Team!< /Review>

Don't come here unless you want to waste your time and money. I came here about a week ago for a full set and spent quite a bit of money.  I tried to go in today for a fix/fill as a walk in and she told me to come back in an hour. I came back and waited over 40 minutes till I got tired of waiting as they took in other walk ins before me .... 3 nails have fallen off within a 8 day span along with some rhinestones. I definitely won't be coming back here.</Text>

< Review>
I came in today for a dip and pedicure. My pedicure came out ok. But my nails a lumpy and she did a gel finish which left a lump of gel on my nail bed. And my skin cracked next to my nail. To top it off I asked for a nail buffer to fix the sides of my nails and the receptionist said “we don’t give those out”. I asked if I could have one never did I say for free. She saw me looking at my nails and never once said would you like for me to ask her to do it for you. Worst service! I also asked my nail tech that if I saw my natural nail on the side of my finger and she said “oh yes” and didn’t fix it.< /Review>

Im a usual here and my daughters but I had a incident here with the receptionist they have here. She is rude & dumb she makes mistakes & don’t admit to them she charged me my daughters service & over charged my daughter for my service and assume it was ok for my daughter to pay for mine & that wasn’t ok I had to pay my daughter the extra money they charged her their was no need for all the confusion if the receptionist would pay better attention to her job & be a lil bit more courteous<//text>

<Text>While I'm happy with the lady that did my pedicure it took an hour after my appointment time to be seen. Then when getting my legs waxed the new lady used the same stick the whole service. She gave me a half axxed excuse on what she was doing but somehow was able to completely understand everything i said after that issue. I left the salon with pieces of wax still on my legs and somehow on the bottom of my feet as well. I will not be going back. Now i question the cleanliness of their tools.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c333df841985d5:0xe1b9ee9d325af47e< /gmap_id></record>

Update: David isn’t here anymore, but now I go to Anthony and he’s great too! Fast and efficient. He’s a pro!

I got my nails done by Tom today, and he also does a wonderful job!!!

Bruh, David is literally THE BEST !!!! He takes his time and gets it right EVERY TIME. He is gentle. He doesn’t break your fingers when getting his angles. He sculpts the nail perfectly, EVERY TIME! Love him! ❤️🙌🙌🙌 just go here and ask for David.< /Review>

I highly recommend going with Danny! He did an amazing job with my Halloween nails, there was no wait at all when I went and he didn't even cut me once.

I have small fingers and usually get cut but he took his time, got the exact shape and colors I wanted as well. The lady at the front desk was incredibly sweet as well!</Review>

During this covid -19 took the risk and the benefit of the doubt by going and I quickly  regretted it. The girl at the front desk is a little rude. Doesn't know how to talk to customers with questions.  Anna is such a doll who did my mani and pedi. There was no sanitation of any of the seats or counters after any customers. Your taking a big risk here. Some people didn't have their mask on properly more like a chin guard. I won't be returning  anytime soon because they are not cleaning and people touching same surfaces.< /text>

Love coming to Stacy for my lash sets.. I’ve gotten the same set for years elsewhere and Stacy convinced me to try something new, and I agreed and LOVED IT!! Mani/pedicures are always with a different person and all are equally great..I always recommend Stacy’s lashes to my friends searching for great service</text>

I can't know for sure but I felt like the ladies were talking about me the whole time they were doing my mani/pedi. Whether they were good or bad comments didn't matter because it made me feel uncomfortable.

Also nail technician that did my pedicure never once stopped to ask a single question. (I hope this isn't TMI but) I had a hangnail that I mentioned to her that she didn't take care of after asking her three times. She may have been new but i wouldn't know, I've only been one time.</Review>

I have been going to this salon since they got a new owner and management.  I always have a good experience and great service.  It's helpful if you can make an appointment because you can guarantee getting your nails or waxing done by your preferred technician.  For nails I recommend Henry and Cindy.  For pedicures, Wendy is awesome!  I go to Stacy for all of my waxing and eyebrow tinting. I will continue to go here even though this salon is out of the way from where I live.   If you haven't been here in a while, I say give it a try!<//text>

<Text>Have been trying this place out for a couple of months now and recently I decided to get my lashes done since I had read reviews and saw how great and natural they felt and how awesome Stacy was. I love them! They are light and so natural looking. The environment is so welcoming and I feel such great energy every time I come. All the customers are always happy and laughing with the employees...I love this place! The only down fall is that they only accept cash tips🙁and I so forgetful about bringing cash since I’m a card gal and I alsways feel guilty.
Keep up the amazing job Stacy and team.

I was reminded really quick why I stopped coming here. I used to be here every week when they first opened, loved the service. Not so great any more, prices keep going up and I always feel like im bothering being here. They might be great with nails but manis and pedis always feel so rushed 😪< /Text>

Stacy is my go to person for lashes! She makes my little Asian eyes more glamorous without making me look too obvious. She usually has same day or same week appointments, fast, & efficient. She puts two layers on my lashes so they're staggered and look more "natural." She has sensitive eye lash glue too, if you feel like there's burning.  My real lashes are sparse and she does a great job trying to preserve what little hairs I have left. I see her about every 3-4 weeks depending on my sweat level and how much make up I'm wearing (the oils and soap dissolve the eyelash glue). I say wake up pretty and see Stacy! When I arrive I lay down on her table. She has a magnify lens and light so she's accurate with her placement. I'm happy with Stacy// been seeing her and following her around and now she has her own place. Worth the drive and money! I tip in cash. I also pay in cash, but you don't have to, they accept CC, but you have to tip in cash. There's an ATM machine in the shop.< /text>

Stacey's lashes Nails and Spa has to be one on the most cleanest and upscale Nail Places I have seen in town! The prices are very afforable and they always find a way to get me in with same day appointments. Stacy does a wonderful job on my eyebrows ! I have been going to her for over 10 years now. She never fails to amaze me on her work!  Cindy and Helen also do a great job on my nails! Thank you Stacey Lashes Nails and Spa  for being my #1 choice for a nail shop in my area! :)<//text>

I think that Stacy's prices are great for everything wax, gel, full set, pedicure, ect! Lashes are $25 and up you can choose which one you want not pressure. They do a great job!!

<Text>I was new to the area and looking for a new nail place. I found it! Very clean, fast and great prices. I've gone a few times now and I received great service consistently. They have a wide variety or gel colors and the pedicure chairs are very comfortable. I also tried their wax and eyebrow tinting. I highly recommend. It has saved me a lot of time from my daily makeup routine in the morning.</Text>< Rating>

Came as a walk-in and was told 10-15 minutes, which was completely doable. After waiting 45, they finally put my daughter and I in a chair with our feet soaking in cold water for another 20 minutes. I completely understand that as a walk- in, a wait is expected, but I don't like being lied to and trapped with my feet soaking wet so that they don't lose the sale. If they had told me an hour, I would've just come back. This is the second time this has happened to me here. Not coming back.</Review>

Came in to get eyelashes done for my bday weekends! The receptionist was so sweet and told me that Vicky would explain the process to me, within 5 min a lady tapped me on the shoulder which I assumed was Vicky. She literally took me to a corner, NOT a room (which they usually have for these types of things) A CORNER by the sinks. Pulls out a book and told me it was 90$. Didn’t explain a thing. and when I tried to ask questions she looked at me like I was crazy for asking.
Horrible customer service by her. And WAY overpriced for the quality of work that she showed me. I had to just walk out. I’m seriously disappointed.<//Text>

Had great experience, tony did a great job on my nails, and Tammy did my pedi good as well. The receptionist aurora was very friendly and outgoing. The store very clean and relaxing. I would recommend this place to my friends.< /Text>

First time coming here and I have to say it was a great experience. I am very happy with my new set. Not going to lie, I was a little nervous at first but I am very satisfied with my nails. I will be coming back to Stacey's Lashes! 😍<//review>

Pedicures here are awesome !!!! Full sets are a bit pricey, but worth it bc I didnt leave with bubbles or any lifting on my nails. But Rose worked too quickly on my set and left them looking not finished. Other than that, this is a great place<//review>

If you’re not a regular, be ready to be put on the back burner. Even with an appointment, you will not be a priority period. Oh and 2 hours later, half the polish on my toes is gone!< /Text>

Complained because my girlfriend was getting a foot massage and I was not and we were going at the same time on the same package. Complained to the manager she said she would knock money off the bill and she did not. My 1st experience getting a pedicure was not good because of this. Not happy at all.< /Review>

<Review>I made an appointment for a refill on my eyelash extensions and when I called to make my appointment that I waited all week for, I told the girl over the phone what I needed and my eyelashes were real mink refill. She asked me how much did I pay and I told her $45 + 15 more for Real Mink. So before I said yes to making appointment..I asked how much will it be?? She said $25-$45 and asked are you sure..she said yes so I booked appointment. I came in today to wait 40 min then to find out they were going to be $85.. This is very upsetting because I could have went to the same place I originally went to which I told them I had made an appointment already with Stacy's.. I wasted my time and day off..now I have to wait a week now..<//Review><username>Roberta Aguilar<//username></record>

<text>this place was horrible! I have never been so disappointed with a nail experience before... I was not happily greeted or welcomed with a smile for starters, my pedicure was rushed and very rough for that matter, my acrylic nails were horrific, she had cut me multiple times and i have bubbles on top of my nails! i would have walked out if i could have! and for the cherry on top, i paid 75 dollars for the crappiest experience and worst pedi and mani of my life... way over priced for terrible service! never again!< /text>< pictures>

<text>I've been here twice. First time I got a mani & pedi. Both were done badly as my nails were clipped crooked. I got a bad attitude from the lady doing my hands as if I made her mad. She was throwing my hands around and twisting them angrily. They were the closest so the second time around I decided to give them a second chance to get a full set acrylic. They came out okay ONLY because I kept correcting the lady to fix the nails that were obviously crooked. I sure wasn't going to pay for a bad job and I'd hate to walk around with bad nails. My friend came with me that time to get a pedi which was done so badly she ended up getting an ingrown toe nail because they clipped her nails crooked too!

On the same day, I had to go back 2 times, bc it was already falling when I left the shop.  It was hurt so much and she put too much of glue that I could not open my eyes.
I have done a lot of times of extensions but all the times, did not hurt this  much.  So I went to get my refund on following next monday cus eyelashes were fall off that it  did not seem that I have gotten eyelash extensions.  I talked her, but she only was saying it is my fault and I took off the eyelashes.
I paid with cash, and she did not give me a recipe. Im sure she is not reporting cash jobs.
Im never going back.
Horrible attitudes, horrible jobs..
I dont even think she learn properly learned how to do eyelash extensions< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< name>

Tried this place out a couple weeks ago and it was pretty darn good! Service was fast, the quality and selection for toppings and teas was good, and it was nice and clean. It was my first time in a setting where I could build my own drink and then have them add my tea of choice and seal it. Neat concept! Definitely a good spot to keep in mind.< /Text>

Cheapest Boba drinks in town, but cheap does not mean less quality. I love how their drinks are not overly sweet. The staff is super accommodating, especially when it comes to mixing drink flavors. I usually get the Taro and Oreo slush mixed with egg custard and lychee. Amazing!< /review>

<Review>Great price. Priced by size and no extra charge for any amount or variety of toppings/add ons. Pick ur size, select your drink, self serve by selecting among 12+toppings, place cup for worker to fill.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80853db0c9e8af57:0x982e7858f6380864< /gmapID></record>

This is the only place I’ve gone to in the outer Bay Area, where the Taro teas haven’t been grainy, unmixed messes! The service is always awesome, the owner is super nice and quick and the crepes are awesome as well!

Highly recommend!< /Text>

I like it. The large size is huge. Not what I was expecting. I like that you can scoop your own toppings. The taste of the drink is good not enough for me to go there for just the drink but more of a if I am in the area why not type of drink lol.</Review>

<review>Great service!! Fun, friendly, place with a decent seating area. You have alot of choices from milk shakes to icy's, along with a toppings area. A small selection of food if you want a bite to eat. Oh and they also have two arcade games and board games!!</review>< Pictures>

Love this place.I never had boba tea until i went here and let me tell you, what a great first experience. The filling bar and the tea was delicious, the owner is super nice and the shot is a cool hang out spot for kids and teens. He also serves hot food. You got to try this place..</Text>

Great boba and self-serve topping bar? Yes, please. The owner is so nice and even let us in after closing when we first visited this cafe. He is always so jolly and isn't looking to rip off customers. Very reasonable prices. Highly recommend!< /text>

<Review>DIRT CHEAP PRICES! AND GOOD QUALITY! The make-your-own-boba bar is creative and amazing. There is a set price depending on the type of drink you want (milk tea, smoothie, tea)-no more than $4- and the quality is just as good as other places. Would recommend strongly and go to all the time if it weren't so far away.< /Review>< Pics>

The food is good. The idea is good, but they need to pay more attention to cleanliness.  The glass doors, floors, and white chairs need a good cleaning.</Review>

They have like a carnival-type basketball hoop, they have giant “connect 4” and a bunch of other games.   It’s nice place to get some boba and have some fun.<//review>< pictures>

So glad I stopped in. Very tasty and juicy beef and chicken kebabs! Well cooked, well seasoned. Served with rice and a potatoes and pea curry. Only thing is I would of preferred a side salad for some greenery. Ask for the chutney, Afghan style sour and herbal with a touch of heat. Will definitely come back and try the rest of the menu.<//text>

<Date>1613786674810</Date><Response>None</Response><text>It’s good food and the manager is super nice and generous! Sometimes I worry with hybrid-food places like this but needn’t worry here! Both the pizza and other options are just as good as each other. I think this place will do well and even better when they can open inside. They have a nice, large  bar area and many beers on tap. You can tell they’ve put a good amount of effort in their building and do not to appear to have cut corners in their renovation process. There’s not enough ethnic food in the area in my opinion, so I’m happy to have somewhere I can order that as well as genuinely good pizza& beer.< /text><GmapID>0x808555a0f0e7cdc9:0xeb726eeec38fd609</GmapID>< UserId.>

This restaurant and its' staff are amazing!! We had gone for the first time a little over a month ago, so I am a little late in my review. However, it is SO nice to go into a restaurant where all the employees have smiles on their faces and are extremely friendly!! They truly went above and beyond the realm of what great customer service is, the owner definitely knows how to run a successful business. Not to mention one of the employees offered to help me out to my truck and I have never had a restaurant do that and their pizza is awesome!! Thank you, will definitely be returning. I just wish it wasn't in such a bad spot on Main Street, however, definitely won't deter us from returning 😊😊< /review>

Went here for the first time and I'll definitely be going back. So excited to have some more flavor choices in Oakley! We got a meat lovers pizza and some burgers and it was great. The chapli burger is wonderful. The staff was super friendly which is always a huge plus. :-)</text>

<review>Best tavern ever. You feel like part of their family. Food is amazing too. Haven’t tried the pizza yet but the wings are better than I have ever had and I have had many from wing places. This is by far the best.  I would totally recommend!!! You will not be disappointed< /review>< pictures>

We went to the Oakley tavern for the first time tonight and want to say that the service was amazing! We ordered a wood fired pizza and wings, both were delicious! They also have a GREAT selection of beers both bottled and on tap and an amazing selection of local wines! The outdoor area had heaters and they even brought our son a cookie(on the house)!  We will be back for the food but even more so for the service!< /Review>

Lots of delicious choices on the menu to choose from too. I ESPECIALLY liked that the food choices are not the same old same old, like most other places. We ordered The Brick Oven Pizza which was AWESOME, and also ordered the Chicken Kabob Burger. Differently Amazing tastes blended perfectly together. We will definitely continue to return to try all the other Menu Item's.
Thank you Oakley Tavern 👍</review>< username>

Yes 5 stars.  Ok 5 stars for a place with Tavern in the name.
The food was pretty darn good.  I just had Indian from a place in Concord and was disappointed.  I could smell how delicious my Tikka Masala was before the plate hit the table.  Tonights dinner made up for my disappointment earlier in the week.  The others in my party had some of the kebob offerings.  The beef...was so tender and juicy.

They have a good selection of local wines and beer as well as a kids menu that is reasonably sized and priced.</Text>

GREAT FOOD and GREAT SERVICE! The prices on their food compared to the quality you get is awesome value. Their food is fresh everyday and ranges from various regions around the world. When the locals are out and about and looking for a place to eat, they go Oakley Tavern!</review>

Pay up front, then sit down to eat either outside or inside.  We chose outside and watch the Amtrak train goes by.  They had outside heater to keep warm on a cool day.  Our orders: Chicken kabobs and chopped burger - both are good.  Money worth - Check it out. We will come back again.</Review><Response>None</Response>< UserId.>

We have now been here twice, the first time we had chicken kabobs and Chaple Kabob both of these were very good. Tonight we came for the pizza and we will be back for the pizza. It is nice to have a place in town that can do a pizza that tastes good and does not sit in your gut like a ton of dough.</Text>

Nice soft opening, few thing. OT needs signs saying go inside and order, bottle beer is luke warm ice chilled, need signage on how big your pizzas are.
Food is yummy! Also look up Italian Margherita pizza it's more red sauce, less shredded cheese and Motz cheese balls, fresh basil after the oven not before</Text>

Everything was AMAZING. They packed so much flavor into the meat, I couldn't put it down! We shared the desserts, they were all delicious. Im not sure what it was, but it was a almond pudding something, it was delicious. Not only was all of the food flavorful and tasty, but the staff was super nice. They were all friendly, attentive, and had a smile on their face. It was a wonderful experience and we can't wait to go back and support a fantastic local business!</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Finally, Oakley has a kebab restaurant!

We decided to try a selection of dishes.

The pizza crust is deliciously chewy and smoky. It’s the best crust I’ve had at any local pizza place. The sauce and toppings are presented nicely but are about average in taste and selection.

The chicken wings were juicy but otherwise also average. It’s nice to get carrots as well as celery with wings, but I wish they were hand cut spears, rather than those kiddie-style baby carrots.

Where Oakley Tavern shines is their kebabs.

We had each kind: Chicken, Beef, and Chapli. These are truly excellent dishes. The meat is well-seasoned and grilled perfectly, with a lovely char. The standout is the Chapli. I don’t ordinarily enjoy grilled mince because it can tend towards dryness. These were astoundingly good - the best I’ve ever had, anywhere. They were flavorful and very, very tender. This is a dish you could make your name with. Well done!

The rice is a fancy basmati. I believe it might be called the ‘sella’ type. The grains are long, plump, have a nice bite, and a naturally buttery flavor. Eating the rice with the meat juices soaking in was pure pleasure.

The Potato-Pea Curry, Green Chutney, and Salata accompaniments were bright and fresh. The Yogurt Sauce was also very good. Whatever yogurt is being used to make this, please don’t change it.

The bread that came with was advertised as naan but it more resembles a thin focaccia. A traditional, chewy, fire-roasted naan would go better. But otherwise, these kebab dishes were flawless.

They’re a new restaurant and are experiencing some operational teething pains. It was chaotic, and we only visited on a Tuesday. I can’t imagine weekend dinner rushes there. One of my items was not packed in my to-go order and so I had to go back for it. There was a lot of hectic running back and forth in the restaurant. They have plenty of staff - who are lovely, friendly, and helpful - but there is a lack of organization. An experienced Expediter is needed to orchestrate things to run smoothly and ensure accuracy. And they need to clarify their menu offerings and make it easy for customers to access. A link to their website and a current menu are essential.

Their kebab meals are outstanding. I sincerely hope that they work out these operational kinks because I want very much for them to succeed. (And I hope they add lamb kebabs to their menu soon! Without lamb, it kind of feels like something is missing. Lamb kebabs, please!!)

My family loved this food. Not only was it tasty, it was wholesome and nourishing. It’s lovely to be able to get takeaway food and feel healthy and well-fed. And on top of it, the meals are a great value. We are so happy to have such a good place to eat locally and we will be back for more!<//review>

<Review>Why is the bread in this place always hard and dry? Why does the subway taste 60% worse than all the others? Why are the doors always locked while they're open? For whatever reason this particular Subway has bad service horrible food and it's kind of a small dingy Little Corner Spot</Review>< rating>

Very bad service! I was ignored when I asked one employee for something it took another employee to notice me and help me out. We had to ask them to clean the table for us. They were not busy and had three employees available to keep tidy. My suggestion to you is avoid to come in on Friday's between 1:00pm and 2:00pm shift! The Subway on North Broadway has good service!<//text>

Very much what you expect from a Subway restaurant. Nothing unusual or special.

Service was moderate and food was good. Not crowded.<//text>

They didn’t have soup ready , or jalapeño bread. For half a sandwich and a drink it came out to 8$ which is almost the price of a footlong . The bread was stale and hard. The food was not fresh<//text>

They're always so unprepared. They are missing many things around 12, that's when they should be the most ready. It's always missing something. I've noticed that they always charge me differently, for the same thing. A meal with a small soda, chips and a six inch sub. I've gotten 8.15, 8.05, 7.56. I'm not going there again.<//Text>

Food was amazing, burgers were cooked perfectly and the amount of food you get is worth going for. Service was a little off, we got sat in one of the first booths and were basically ignored after we got our food. Whoever was running the show was barking orders at staff in front of the patrons which was bitter sweet because it showed they run a tight ship, but at the same time I'm trying to enjoy my meal, not hear the supervisor yell orders at the staff while she's standing right next to both of our empty drinks that were never refilled. Still worth going, not many places can make a better burger in town.< /review>

<text>Sorry to say, not the best. I bought a avocado cheese burger & soda. My friend bought a veggie burger. Both burgers seemed at best room temp. However, my avocado was so hard I had to take a piece out of my mouth as not to break a tooth!! Lol
The manager came over and asked if I would like another burger or refund. I said refund, but still got billed for the soda... $3.21
I hadn't see my friend I was with for years so the embarrassment and damage was already done, when I had to take the whole piece out of my mouth
I will not go to that Red Robin again!!</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>I almost didn't post, but had to. My Mom, son, and I went to Red Robin around 6:00 last night. We had completely forgotten that it was grad night for many local schools. When we were told 30 mins, we decided to wait. During our wait, we witnessed verbal assaults towards staff, people asking staff to make other people leave so they could have a table, and just overall examples of extreme rudeness towards staff. There was one party of over 10 that insisted they be seated in the 75 minutes they were quoted. 85 minutes in, they were threatening to call "corporate" if they weren't seated. They also called the other party that they were waiting to leave, "disrespectful of others time". I was honestly shocked by the lack of understanding. It was grad night and parties were celebrating. I honestly couldn't even imagine dealing with the nastiness that those hosts/managers experienced in the 27 minutes that we waited for a table. Even with all that was going on, our food came out fast/delicious, and our server was amazing admist all the chaos. The Red Robin staff handled pressure and rudeness like trained pros. They will always have our business.<//review>< response>

Great experience! Even though they were busy they were able to get us in with little wait. Fast service, good food. Only thing I could gripe on is the cleanliness of the restaurant. Not enough to remove a star though.</review>

<text>They've had a three-star up until this post,
Our waitress was fantastic and worked from start to finish, her name was Heidi ! And for the first time, I had the fish and chips, the cod was huge and flaky and cooked to perfection,  it was a real delight : )
My eating partner, she had the
whiskey bacon cheeseburger medium rare and it was again fabulously cooked and smelt terrific, onion rings are always something to gorge on with large glasses of sweet tea : ))<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<date>1618823749422<//date><text>I eat here about 3 times a week. Never any problems so i tip good.
Maybe its the way i look or because im native but i really felt that the waiters disrespected me and my girl. For no reason. We dont feel like we want to ever go back.
My family has been fighting for this land for 100s of years and we still are to this day as military/army/navy ect. Its sad just because im not dressed up all the time i should be disrespected. After all we offer our lives so America can sleep good and safe or can eat good.
Just dont go around 3pm. On a Sunday very bad service or no service at all. Our appetizers came dry and no ranch waiter did not ask if we needed anything but they kept walking by. Also my drink was spilling over on the table as another waiter put it there expecting me to clean the mess up my self. With the one napkin that was added to my menu. After me and my girl waite for help on the ranch and the drink mess. No help was offered but waiters did walk by and look at us as if we were not wanted or welcome. So i decided i did not like the way were where treated i offered to pay for the bad service i received and left after i canceled the rest of my order.</text>< Name>

<review>Okay, so I really like Red Robin, because of their sides like mac and cheese and garlic steak fries. Next time I go there, I will try the mac and cheese burger. That sounds awesome. The mac and cheese is actually made from a homemade roux and cheddar sauce. I thought the first time I was there that the burgers were super good. They were. But the crazy thing is that they don't top Denny's burger TO ME. Blasphemy, I know...The patty was definitely way thicker than nasty ol' McDonald's and Burger King, but I wasn't sure if it was a patty pre-made, or a hand-patted out one.... Not that impressive. I'm giving five stars for the menu, service and choices of cheese and bread alone. It was a bit thin for a $12 burger. There are visual signs of the obvious hand patting of the that I like to see, like the uneven edges where it splits and you tried to shape it right🤭 I don't know if I saw that on my RR, but the burgers ARE super good and they come with this really great seasoning you can put on them. I'm def goin back! Yuuuuummmmm!<//review>< Pics>

I am very impressed with their COVID procedures, everyone was in masks and taking precautions. I also always appreciate their special attention to allergies as I have several. The food hits the spot, the service is great, and all the gluten-free options are really flavourful. Thank you guys for working so hard to provide a safe environment for eating 👍🏻< /text>

Ordered ours for pickup. They got the order 100% correct, were ready on time, were very fast, and they gave us more fries than we expected! Can't go wrong with that! Best of all, food was EXCELLENT! Overall a 5-star experience. My only suggestion: request more fries dip! At least 3x what they would normally give you. It goes fast!</Text>

There is no indoor dining in Redding and so I showed up and they immediately took my order. I waited about 15 minutes and I was able to get my food. It was nice and hot and fresh.< /review>

Curbside is quickest and Covid friendly way to enjoy the food while it's hot and at it's best.</review>

Ive always seen the commercial Reeeeeeed Robiiiiiin yummmmm ive never once tried it. Today was the day i first tried it. I had no idea you get unlimited fries that's so cool! I freaking love fries! Theyre pretty good to! Staff were very friendly and the place is very clean. The burger is alright its not super fancy. Their rewards is pretty cool i think is 10 visits you get something free. Oh and on your birthday you'll get a free burger! They also will sing you a happy birthday song! That place is best to go for the unlimited fries!!!</Text>

<Review>Shockingly impressed. Service was fast and friendly. Food was very good. fish and chips tasted fresh and we're cooked to perfection.

I was also surprised to be happy with the covid-19 safety procedures. Redding California can be very hit-and-miss with covid-19 safety. But this place seem to be doing a really good job.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Got the "gourmet" bacon cheeseburger, but it was surprisingly lacking flavor thereby negating the gourmet description. Ordered the cheeseburger with pink in the middle and it was lacking any pink at all. Frankly, I can get a better burger at half the cost from McDonald's or Carl's Jr. Fries and onion rings were good. The Freckled Lemonade was horribly watered down, tasting more like water with lemon, and had only two freckles in the two slices of strawberry. The Poppin' Purple Lemonade was dangerously awesome!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>This place deserves a 4 star rating. This establishment is well known through the States, and is an American favorite by many. I feel it's a modernized Tavern fusion, mixed with a spritz of American history. A loud, trendy crowd is often attracted here. Good food, good customer service.<//Text></record>

I love red Robin! But.... some how some way I can tell them I want my burger DEAD, burnt, non mooing and it always comes out first not dead, pink or medium rare.. then I do the whole send it back but I never end up eating it after that.... seeing blood or even pink in my food grosses me out and I lose my appetite. I know weird but the manager does always make up for it in one way or another. Just wish it would come out right the first time!< /Review>

<text>I love Red Robin. Always have and always will. I do have a small “karen“ rant though. Around 9:40 pm a few days ago, after my table had finished paying and we were chatting, our server came up to us and asked to bus our table and said “I’m about to hit overtime here so I need to get this cleaned up.” We were all confused because Red Robin closes at 10 Or 11 usually. Then as we left we saw a sign on the door stating new covid hours meant closing was at 9pm. First of all, when we arrived your doors were wide open, so no one is reading your signs. Secondly, just tell people you close at 9 rather than waiting 40 minutes for us to leave and then passive aggressively begin clearing our table. And third, how does closing an hour or two earlier prevent the virus? Seriously? I still love Red Robin but businesses changing their hours because of the pandemic is just so stupid. And hey, notifying people properly of your new hours is key 👍🏻< /text>< Pictures>

I’m giving one star because I want this message to flag the management.  I enjoy this Red Robin for the atmosphere and the food, but today I left.  I wish that we could all live together and find the balance between the differences we all have and not keep infringing on ones rights to support another’s. They had a guest come for lunch with their large long  haired dog,.  Now I understand this is very common today and is supposed to be accepted and tolerated without question or complaint.  But I had to exercise my only remaining freedom after the host sat these guests just on the other side of the kitchen wall.   I had a long haired cat and I know those hairs travel, and human traffic and ceiling fans are great mixers.  Why can’t the balance be seating the pets away from the kitchen?!.</Review>

<Review>The margaritas were weak and watered down. When we asked to have them increased a shot was brought to us and we were charged $5.99. We also played one of the games on the table monitor and without telling us we were charged another $2 while we waited for our food to arrive. We will not be visiting Red Robin again.< /Review>< Time>

Still a nice place to eat. For small families. If you're a party of more then 8+ guest, BBQ at home  don't flood the place and complain y'all can't sit together in an already spaced for social distance room.</text>

<text>I love their food, it is delicious!!!! But one time on my sister’s birthday, they lost our order and we waited and waited for about 2 hours before our food came, and they gave us our dinner for half off and apologized several times. I know this happens rarely, but it still was frustrating, and they should’ve given us the meal for free. I’m giving it a four because I really do enjoy their food, but one star was taken off because of this mishap. Sorry Red Robin!</text>< Pictures>

My husband and I decided to stop in tonight to have dinner. We were welcomed and seated promptly. Our waitress was very nice and attentive. We placed our order, and we received both appetizer and main dishes at the same time. The waitress apologized and the manager came by and apologized as well. He also made it right by giving us a discount for the inconvenience. The food was hot and delicious. The service made the experience for sure. We will definately return.< /Text>

The food is usually pretty good, and the services is great. But we went to the Redding Ca. location a few days ago and the place was so dirty. Starting with the glass doors and window! Then as we were seated there was food and napkins all over the floor. Then the table we were sat at was dirty. As we sat waiting for our order we noticed the blinds were covered in dust. And then noticed the lamp above our table (and all others we could see) were also covered in dust. Come on...clean this place up...or we will not be back!!!< /Text>

My first impression of the restaurant was “Man, they have lots of entertainment for kids here.” They have personal chalk boards and a big chalkboard on the wall for them to draw on while you wait to be seated.

We arrived at 7:15 and was seated by 7:22 (not a long wait, which was nice).

The hostess was friendly and he brought us to our table. It went downhill from there.

7:35 hits and we finally meet our server who brought some silver wear.. , then our server mumbles... “would you like something to drink” we said just water.. and she said okay. Brought us water... and we were so ready to order after waiting 15min before even being acknowledged.

It then took about 35 minutes to get our food.. keep in mind we have a 4 year old toddler who can’t sit still that long! Normally a good server at Red Robin would notice this and say, “I’ll bring some French Fries right out for her”.

....We didn’t even get offered any fries ourselves...

After speaking with the manager he kinda stumbled on his words, then said well... “We don’t bring them out before your food unless you ask... we arnt really following that bread before dinner approach” which in my find is so totally poor service. I have noticed the last couple times we’ve visited any Red Robin they have not brought them out unless we stated we wanted them in advance, and when they do bring them out there’s only like 8 fries lol. Then your food comes out with a few... and when your all finished.. they ask if you want more! “Okay sure you say”.. then they bring out more than you have received with the two servings prior... don’t you think it should be the opposite? More first and less later? Seems like better service to me...

So anyway, it didn’t end with the service being slow. The first impression of our server was not great. She had a resting “b***h face, and frowned as soon as she thought you weren’t looking. Didn’t have a great energy or vibe. To top things off I customized my burger adding onion straws and grilled pineapple. The onion straws showed up on the burger, but not the pineapple... the manager was nice and comped is $10 for the wait and burger goof. I am very appreciative of that. Shortly  after I spoke with the manager, I learned our server was new, which is fine, but I’d recommend she drink a Red Bull or soda on her next shift.

Lastly, this Red Robin appears to be very busy with groups. I’m not sure they have the staffing to keep up with all their tasks... the floors were disgusting... there was a piece of broccoli on the floor next to me the entire time.< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2CifxYcC2nffzxZ4C7zbBjDoCj5z1H_6cJ214=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXvL8MV54TeIE6h49zbuorWvlhSaCE-FqEJs_g=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNUpceuBzHHnKrZnqTu0CBaC9CgLHQ7VzT8fjQy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBjFJb3UCZmUfQhHG79mEnOWURkho25BvlKbfd=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x54d29333053b2531:0xdac21a966ad20da3< /Gmap_id></record>

Only reason they are getting more than one st at from me is because I know the manager that works there Michelle and she’s great. But RED ROBIN with heir new recipe changes went from gourmet to drive through quality. Just saying. Bring it back!!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>First off you can't beat the bottomless fries! They have a great selection of burgers that are amazing not to mention huge. I was able to finish my burger just barely but when I did there was no room for my fries. Our waitress was very attentive. Although I do think they are a little overpriced for a burger joint. I get it is a restaurant but I have a hard time paying that much money for a burger and fries. I will definitely go back just not as often as I would like due to the prices.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Busy. Fries served cold. Waitress was good but overwhelmed. Usually better than average fast food, but this time less than "meh." I can't imagine saying never again, but I'd go Five Guys instead.</Text>

Amazing burgers and salads. Plus amazingly they put delivery food on high priority and separate. Very profesional . And fast. Door dash in my opinion....< /Text>

Atmosphere...average, service...average, food...really good! Service is mostly automated. You will get your own menu from a menu stand on the table and pay your own bill on a table top computer. Maybe next time I can cook and serve my own food?< /text>

Called red robin to place our order for pick up my son went to pickup the order of 3 burgers 2 of which only had cheese bacon and mushrooms how hard is that? I guess pretty hard because they. Left 1 totally Missing and one missing the mushrooms. Then Ally the women helping my son copt a major attitude the management was going to comp my burger and Ally stared my son down and shook her head about it like my son was some sort of tight wad so he paid for the whole order even though he shouldn't have in my opinion. Poor service all the way around will NOT BE BACK EVER!!!!!! So if you chance it and go to red robin in Redding make sure and check your order before leaving!!!< /text>

Ordered on-line for curbside pick-up, even though I had signed in, my reward offer was not taken off my bill. It's supposed happen automatically. I called the restaurant and they were very helpful in getting the credit back on my card. Food was ready when they said it would be. The online menu says the fish, shrimp, & chips comes with coleslaw and chips, but i did not get the coleslaw.  Also the fish pieces were much smaller than the regular fish & chips. My wife ordered grilled onions on her cal chicken sandwich,  but the onions were not grilled. Other than that the food tasted great.</Text>

Food as always was good. Service was  kinda slow but they were slammed tonight. Server forgot dipping sauce and it took awhile to actually get it. All in all not bad. Price was even decent. Better burgers and prices at red Robin compared to Logan's Roadhouse.<//review>

<text>Went in Saturday July 5th. My sister's burger was good, my chicken breast was the smallest I've ever gotten at a Red Robin and had to hack at it with a steak knife to try to cut it. Fries delicious as always but didn't get asked if we wanted more. I am afraid I left hungry because of the small portions. Been going to Red Robin in Salem, Oregon for years, moved down here and surprised at the service, higher prices and smaller portions. Maybe it was just an off day, still disappointed. First time this has happened at a Red Robin.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

We walked in and sanitizer available immediately and they even sanitized menu after each person looked at it... Awesome... They were wearing gloves and while talking I was telling them my buddy and I are truck drivers from Wisconsin... just want a burger and gonna go to bed, we were tired, and decided to get a hotel for one night, you know shower, shave a good comfortable  nite sleep, the manager working thanked us for our service and paid for half are meal and gave us a soda, while thanking us for keeping things moving... I am very grateful and will recommend this restaurant to every trucker I know that comes to the west, again ty so much we love your hospitality  and will definitely tell my friends family and social network of friends about this great experience... #WEAREAMERICANSTRONG</text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><date>1585535852461</date><userid>106543090615085720239< /userid>< rating>

Slow service.  Greasy food.  Looks nothing like the photo.  Taste nothing like discribed.  $16.00  for a thin burnt hamburger patty.
100% better at
IIN N OUT BURGER!!
for a little over $3.
MUCH BETTER service as well.
Would not recomend to anyone. !<//review>

This place is always really busy, and loud, but that's because it's all around a really great place to eat! All that stuff is to be expected at a great restaurant! The food is wonderful, and the drinks are strong! The staff is awsome, happy, friendly, and get you enjoying your meal, in reasonably good amount of time! Great deals, and their new machines that you pay with and order from on each table are totally neat and convenient!! Love this place and their bottomless steak fries!!</Review>

Food is good. But waits are hit or miss. Sometimes it's 15 minutes for food. Sometimes it's 55. Also, well done is a hit and miss (most of the time I've asked by for well done on a hamburger and still gotten pink.)<//Review>

We had been camping without service for several days and didn't know about the fire and evacuations. We were still hours from home and had to take a longer route because the fire blocked Hwy 299. We were VERY grateful Red Robin was still taking orders, we needed to eat and the food was just as good as it normally is. Good job for taking care of your team members and also taking care of us!<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Rude. Waiter was trying to flirt with the table across the way and did not have time for my table. They have 12 clean open tables and put us next to the kitchen. Back of house people was having fun and playing loud music that I dont want to listen to. When I asked to move it was a big deal. Even though they had tables.  If we did not drive an hour to get here because my child wanted to eat here for her special occasion we would have eaten at in and out. The food was wrong. Drinks was not filled just over all badly ran. Maybe the manager just doesn't know or care what is going on.< /Review>

Absolutely terrible experience. Service was horrid despite being the ONLY customers in the bar area. Our waitress spent majority of the time gossiping with the bartender. When she did come to our table every once in a great while, she was rude and appeared to be in a bad mood. My burger came without the barbeque sauce that was listed on the menu as an ingredient for the sandwich, and was not served on their "black plate" that they push so much for their "gourmet" burgers. Fries were old and dry as if they had been sitting out in the kitchen all day. My salad was served alongside my burger on a HOT plate instead of in a cold salad bowl. Will definitely NOT be returning. Waste of money & time.<//Review>

My wife and I went there for dinner a few nights ago, we were asked if we would be okay with seating ourselves in the bar which we were totally okay with. We both got a different one of their burgers, and I tried their garlic fries. Our server continuously kept my fries full and didn't let my plate go empty until we were leaving. Neither did either of our Cups ever run dry</Text>

Very fun atmosphere. We ate at the bar they were very busy at 2:00 on a Sunday. Our waitress was friendly and expressed what a great place to work!
The guys had  the guacamole and taco burgers. I enjoyed the delicious fried cod strips with the great frys. A
Great place to take your out of town guest. Priced very reasonable.<//Review>

<review>Great food, great people, great prices- an excellent place for a great meal!  The know gluten-free here, they have an easy-to-understand food allergy menu, and they're a test store so there are menu items and processes (like the grey "gluten-free" markers) that other Red Robin locations don't have.  Overall, an hour excellent dining experience even for folks who go to other Red Robin's regularly.<//review><gmap_id>0x54d29333053b2531:0xdac21a966ad20da3</gmap_id>< user>

< Review>
It's not mind blowing but definitely decent. Good variety of options beyond burgers. It's kid friendly and festive. I prefer the more local and less franchise feeling Maxwell's to Red Robin when I want a burger... But if I'm meeting a group here it is good enough that I'm happy coming here.</Review>

<Text>Food very overpriced.  I had fish and chips for $14.29. The fish was not very good.  I have the one piece at The Light house and you get two pieces which is about the same amount of fish you get at Red Robin.  The quality of the fish, the batter is much better at Light House and only about , $7.50.  Red Robin is ridiculously noisy.  You can't hardly visit.  The waitresses were the best thing at Red Robin.  They are very good.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>The place is always busy and hopping with activity. Great place to go with a group and/or birthday party, but loud for a date. Their burgers are getting a little more pricey, but with all the bottomless options, it’s worth it. Love the purple bottomless drink, I can’t remember what it’s called. And of course the bottomless fries. Right now, my favorite is the whiskey river chicken wrap. So delicious.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Food was good but our waitress sucked.  When she was around she was in such a hurry that we didn't get to finish what we were saying.   Had to wait a good 20 mins for refills.<//text>

Great customer service. Wait for a table can be a little long at times. Definitely try out their garlic fries if you like garlic! Would recommend. Prices are a little steep at times.< /Review>

Try the strawberry lemonade smoothie! Great burgers, friendly staff and clean building. Bottomless steak fries make everything better! Never had to ask twice for more fries or sauces. Place gets really loud very quickly even with only three or four tables seated at opposite corners of the restaurant.< /Text>

This Red Robin is really good, the food is always hot and the way you ordered it. Their burgers are some of the best in the Redding area. Even when they are busy the service is always fast and very helpful and knowledgeable of stuff on the menu.<//Review>

She was very quick to try to fix out food but all in all it was horrible food. I had ordered a chicken burger with grilled pine apple and teriyaki sauce. My mom had ordered a chicken mushroom Swiss burger and my father ordered a chicken salad. Our first batch of fries we had received was extremely over seasoned and inedible with the amount of salt on them. Our server then rushed to get us new ones after apologizing but the batch she had brought back had zero seasoning at all. Both my mom and I' s burgers were so soggy that we couldn't pick them up and had to eat with fork and knife. My chicken was smothered in sauce that was was very thick like syrup and unpleasant to eat. The pine apple had a metallic taste like it was stored in a can. My mom's burger tasted fine but was so soggy and runny from wet mushrooms. My father's salad came with blackened chicken and once again way over seasoned. It was a very unpleasant lunch but our server was great and made up for it.</review>< user_name>

Service was great, polite and attentive. Decent beer selection. Burger wasn't quite worth the $15, as I asked for medium and it was cooked on the well done side of well done. Fries were kinda soggy but seasoned well. I would love to come back for dessert / adult beverages only as they all looked delicious. Overall, just not quite what I was hoping for. I don't know what I was expecting from a chain restaurant, and the idea is great, but the execution was sub par.< /Review>

Food is overpriced for the quality. Not to mention the excess amount of noise. For some reason I could go to a similar restaurant and it wouldn't be near as noisy as Red Robin is.</Text>

<Review>I actually like this place a lot most of the time they're almost I would say very consistent and expects to either Burgers to A-1 and Southern Charm are by far my favorite and if I think of a type of Applebee's place that serves burgers this is at or just a simple date night plus there's hard alcohol so that's always a bonus it's just that the drinks are watered down and not worth what you're paying for them otherwise I like redrobin lot just don't order the onion rings and y'all have a good time I just hate city is blue with almost nothing but chains but also my girlfriend is gluten intolerant so she can't have wheat this is by far one of the only places I have found in Redding where you can actually get gluten-free buns so while i indulge in my gluten she can for once not have to get a burger protein style let alone if you order from the Hyatt menus get a good quality cotton beef and you can't argue with unlimited fries now if only they would do unlimited drinks....😄</Review>< Pictures>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Their prices are what could be expected for a sit down restaurant, but you do get a great meal for your money. With most of their burgers you get bottomless steak fries. They will keep bringing them until you leave. (Don't be afraid to ask for them to be made to order though, they will accommodate you.)

Our server checked in with us, and made sure that we always had water and soda in our glasses. (Which was not an easy talk for a party of 12.) The manager even came and talked with us to see how everything was going.

Try the Campfire sauce with your fries and even on your burger. It's free, you just have to ask for it.<//Review>< pics>

We went for mothers bday dinner and were shocked at how fast the service was. We got in fast and our food served fast. The food was excellent also. The only complaint is the waitress didn't come to the table the whole time we were eating so we needed some things like refills of fries and water.<//Text>

<Text>Loved it! Great food, and attentive staff. Although there was an older, non-uniformed lady (franchise owner, maybe?) who seemed to be interfering with what our waitress was doing for us even though she was doing a perfectly fine job. Older lady brought us our food and the waitress came to our table, flustered about where our food went. I've been that waitress and I know how much that sucks, so that was annoying. Otherwise everything was nice and the little tablet at the table for customers was really cool.</Text><time>1444640764563<//time>< Response>

<review>A nice Red Robin establishment, not super busy durning the lunch rush.  Unfortunately we had to ask for a table to be cleaned and noticed nearly every other patron had to do the same.  Food came out fairly timely and the burger was actually cooked through (exactly how I wanted it).  Waitress wasn't very attentive, but was nice nonetheless.</review>< pictures>

<Review>Good service. The BlackBerry tea was refreshing and bottomless, and the blackberry cream soda was surprisingly good - not very sweet and plenty fizzy. We enjoyed the Avo-Cobb-O and Southwestern salads, and the Fajita burger was very tasty. The Porkiyaki burger tasted good, but definitely could tell it was reconstructed pork.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

I thought for being a packed house on Saturday it wasn't bad I still got pretty good service. I like the pay and go feature. My bf didn't like how there was a big gap of bread between the meat and the edge of the bun but I think all and all it was good. I like that they have a veggie burger and salads for this vegetarian /vegan.< /review>

Decent place to get a bite to eat. Clucks N fries with Buzz sauce and ranch is good. Waitress was sarcastically fun. Still if you are used to how Red Robin was a while back when they would bring bottomless fries when you say and refilled then without asking, those were the good days, now they charge you if someone sits at your table and doesn't order any, a "seat" fee.</Review>

It has been a few years since I have eaten at this location.  I was extremely disappointed this visit.   I will say up front the manager did discount the meal but I still will not return.  Service was subpar at best.  Food was ice cold when served and the place was dirty.  The glassware had a film on it and I looked at others next to us and the glassware looked the same.  We requested new drinks along and the manager said they would bring them from the bar because other glasses were cleaner. Our food had to be recooked.  As we were waiting for our food tables around us were complaining about the time it took to get food and or the quality.  My daughter said she had a similar experience with the one in Roseville recently.  Sorry Red Robin I won’t be going back.< /Review>

It was pretty decent for how packed they were. Me and my boyfriend got our seats right when we came in and the food had some wait but there was birthdays going around the whole time so people were busy. But the customer service was great and so was timing. Thank you!! ❤️</review>

We sat in the bar area tables with great service.  We ordered burning love burger and southwest salad.  Food was so-so and I seem to remember it being much better quality at previous/other Red Robins.  Bottomless fries were excellent.< /text>

They have pretty good burgers for a chain restaurant.  $9-13 range.  Not a bad selection of beers/drinks.  Good place for birthdays or groups.  Loud and busy environment.<//Review>

<username>Lacey Hall</username><Review>Red Robin has the best gluten free burgers anywhere and they have gluten free buns too...which makes them AWESOME! They also have a fryer just for gluten free fries. The staff is always polite and helpful and if they do screw up they are happy to fix their mistake and will even take it off the check if their screw up was bad enough. I go as often as I can...that's how good they are!<//Review></record></dataset><record>

Last time we ate here, our waitress didn’t even greet us for over 45 minutes didn’t get drinks for over an hour and saw our waitress a total of 3 times and not once was she bringing us drinks, food or even asking us if we needed anything. Thank god for the server who noticed and took us on along with the rest of his own tables.< /Review>

She never brought us are ranch when we asked  multiple times  For it then rolled her eyes when I asked for her name .  So if you get a waitress name Athena head to the door and run  .

Red Robin is an okey burger restaurant. But it is better than fast food restaurants. The best are the French fries. They are very thick and tasty. Some drinks are bottomless and the fries too.<//Review>

Best place for burgers hands down. Never had a tastier burger in my life before. A lot better than Mcdonalds, Burger King, etc etc. If you want quality burger go to Red Robbins.</Review>

I used to love coming here as a kid.  It still has a great atmosphere for a family restaurant.  I don't live in Redding anymore, but both times I came  up in the last month I ended up eating here.</text>

The food is good, as always.  But the service was lacking. When we have to ask constantly to get more fries or refills on soda and still doesn't happen,  that's not service.  Bottom less fries actually did have a bottom,  and it was apparently after our FIRST serving.  Not impressed at all</Text>

<Review>I'll certainly try the place again, because it has a lot of potential, but the waitresses need to understand the concept of "bottomless" fries. Bottomless means you come back to the table every once in awhile and make sure the customer gets some refills< /Review><user>110219094964920167100< /user><Date>1546927038211< /Date></record></dataset><record>

I have gone here many times throughout my life growing up in the area, and it has always been one of my favorites. However, when we went last week, the experience was not good. When the server brought the food out, we asked for a refill on our basket of fries. She said, “Sure,” but she never came back. We are all of our food, and still no more fries. There was a group of about 25 arriving, and it seemed every employee’s focus was on them and the rest of us were ignored. We used the kiosk thing to call the waiter. It blinks so they know you need something. Our table got walked passed 12 times by various employees before finally a manager acknowledged us. We almost debated not even asking for more fries and risk sitting there for an even longer time to finish up and get the bill. Kiosk wouldn’t take my rewards number so the manager had to run it manually. This is one of the ONLY bad experiences I’ve had here. It will not keep me from returning. This visit was a 1 Star, but I give it a 3 because of many positive experiences. Side note, food was excellent as always.<//Review>

We arrived in town late so I figured RR was a safe bet.  Boy, was I wrong!  The chili cheese fries had zero flavor, the floor was so dirty it was slippery, AND the employees whined and complained about their job and other employees non-stop.   The horrible experience was tipped by wait staff cussing up a storm in the bar with a little boy waiting out front for his parent in the bathroom.  Unacceptable behavior RR!</Review>

Still waiting for our food, over 30 minutes now. Simple order for family of four, placed at 12:02, before lunch rush hit. I can make my own burgers at home and have them grilled by now. My order better come out correct or I will file a much bigger complaint then just a bad review.</text>

< Review>
I have gone here many times throughout my life growing up in the area, and it has always been one of my favorites. However, when we went last week, the experience was not good. When the server brought the food out, we asked for a refill on our basket of fries. She said, “Sure,” but she never came back. We are all of our food, and still no more fries. There was a group of about 25 arriving, and it seemed every employee’s focus was on them and the rest of us were ignored. We used the kiosk thing to call the waiter. It blinks so they know you need something. Our table got walked passed 12 times by various employees before finally a manager acknowledged us. We almost debated not even asking for more fries and risk sitting there for an even longer time to finish up and get the bill. Kiosk wouldn’t take my rewards number so the manager had to run it manually. This is one of the ONLY bad experiences I’ve had here. It will not keep me from returning. This visit was a 1 Star, but I give it a 3 because of many positive experiences. Side note, food was excellent as always.</Review>

The menu is much shorter than it used to be, the "cup" of chowder is more like a half-cup, the prices higher than ever before. Another good eatery gone "just-plain-average".<//text>

<review>My son and I went for lunch. We were the first customers in the door and the second to order. While waiting the 45 min it took to get our food we watched several other patrons get served. In the end it was 2 drinks and 2 mediocre burgers for 30$... burgers were good but not 30$ good and were not cooked to order</review>< resp>

Our server paid absolutely no attention to us.
The "bottomless fries"  is a joke. Not only did our server seem to avoid our table all together, we had to ask to get our fries back because she took the basket the first time to get more but never came back with any. We waited and waited as our server kept passing by our table serving guests around us.
More insulting that she acted as casual as possible, as if our visit wasn't taking forever with no food or drinks .
Terrible experience for mediocre food.< /Text>

<Text>4 stars cuz is cost a bit for me but if you got the money is worth it. I ate so many French fries so Good the hamburger I saved took home ate it while watching a movie. I really enjoyed their food so yummy . If you got a bit to spend go here food is super good, and if you drink they have a bar you can eat in there. I recamend to reserve if they do that cuz can be crowded, but is nice and service is very good<//Text><Gmap_id>0x54d29333053b2531:0xdac21a966ad20da3<//Gmap_id></record>

<Review>Noisy, overpriced, and nothing you can't make at home. I hadn't been in here for several years, and I was shocked by the increase in the prices. On top of that, I could barely get into the lobby with the number of people waiting for tables. I just don't understand the fascination with the place. Why would I pay $100 for burgers for a family of four? In the future, I won't.<//Review><Rating>2</Rating>< user_name>

Place has gone down hill. Used to be my favorite Berger place, now there servings are small the servers don't know the menu very well or the restaurant. They don't refill your drinks or fries unless you track them down and ask, even then it's another 10 minutes before you get it done.<//Text>

The food is usually pretty good the service is usually better then it was this last time we went. The place wasnt really that busy I've seen it busier they did have quiet a few people in there but nothing crazy. Our waitress kept forgetting things and we had to ask multiple times and she just kinda seemed like she was sad or didnt want to be there. I didnt know what one it was but as a fellow waitress I know the job (waitressing) can have it's hard moments but you just have to put on a smile and keep going.< /text>

Bartender was. Rude and unhelpful. My first visit to a red Robin restaurant. She did no make eye contact or ask questions. Not even said thank you. I ask about the choices I had witch she did not make any suggestions. She vanish from de bar area and o had to ask a server to refill my drink. Really bad service<//text>

Good food, GREAT service!  We were there with family, 4 of the 5 of us had special requests due to diets and health issues.  All were accommodated and every order was right.  Our server was Katie.  She was attentive without being intrusive.  She kept my husband's water glass full(no easy task) and even made it seem like her not understanding my father was the fault of her hearing in a noisey room. He has a neorological issue that causes his speech to be garbled.  I could have hugged her for that.<//Review>

<text>I have eaten here 3 times and this is the worst experience. Im sorry to report but the waitress that servwd my table was very rude, she forgot our straws for our drinks and when I flagged her down after ignoring me saying Exscuse me several times, she pulled the straws from her apron and tossed them on the table. When she brought our food I asked for new silver ware because my fork was dirty, she gave me attitude for that. Then never came back to check our table. She walked by and sat our bill on the table and walked off. When we left we checked out at the front and the cashier gave her our credit card to run and she said it was denied so we paid cash. When we got to our car we check with our card company and their was plenty money on the card. She didn't show a receipt that she ran the card to show it was denied. I also used the rest room their and the place has really went down hill, the bathrooms were disgusting and soap dispencer didnt work, toilets filthy. I will never go here again!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Beefy looking waiter sucked. He hardly checked on us and when asked for a box, he forgot and was sitting down, chatting. We left without the rest of the food. Food took a long time to come out too. Very disappointed.</Review>

Waitress was too wrapped in table next to us birthday song so they did not give me straw so I fumbled lemonade on my underwear which are very sticky now
I don’t have my food yet but I need straws
They did not salt my fries and treated me like a poor peasant and the salt thing was too complicated for me<//review>

<Text>Busy and little noisey but what's that when youre celebrating birthdays with the family and got all the fries you can eat!  Probably an in frequent happening but it was embarrassing for our 17yr old g-daughter to have to ask replacement burger due to dressing being applied contrary to the order.< /Text>< Pictures>

Server knocked the sandwich off the plate when she delivered to table, did not offer to replace it. The sweet potato fries were cold, the BLT Croissant had very little crumbled bacon.< /Text>

Had the blue cheese burger, husband had bacon cheeseburger. Tomato on burger more orange looking than red. Overall I would say this place is more hype than anything. Need to improve service and don't expect me to automatically give you a 20 percentage when I check out at my table. I couldn't believe that is what they suggested considering the fact 2 burger and ice tea< /Review>

Waitress was too wrapped in table next to us birthday song so they did not give me straw so I fumbled lemonade on my underwear which are very sticky now
I don’t have my food yet but I need straws
They did not salt my fries and treated me like a poor peasant and the salt thing was too complicated for me</Review>

2nd time here, 2nd time sloppy expensive burger. Ordered bacon + guacamole, came with neither. Sent it back, came with no recognizable guacamole and half cooked bacon. Manager had to comp. it. Famous place for burgers? Not.</text>

If I could leave a zero I would. Floors were slimy and very dirty. Waitress was rude and forgot or food for almost an hr. Food was cold. I said something to manager and seemed like he didnt care. Never again. Not a good way to to treat a vet in veteran's day.< /text>

This Red Robin is lacking in customer service. The bottomless fries are deceiving.  You might get 10 more fries in 20 minutes or longer even if you order them when you get your entree! My husband's wonders if they peel the potatoes in the back?<//Text>

There's a problem with to go orders, twice wrong in two weeks and living 9 miles away so too far to go back 😑 Decide to go inside and we ordered a sandwich and got a complete different sandwich? Ordered 2 chilli's and they split the one? So we just didn't say anything and ate & paid and left 😏<//Text>

Food was cold and soup had hair in it. Waitress said so sorry but it was fine when she brought it out. Like we put the hair in it. Won't be going back for a while.</text>
