< review>
I love this place.  Been coming here for years.   Just had their Tuesday special street tacos.  I love their al pastor.  They are 🔥  most places are too inconsistent with their quality and this place time after time delivers.  Thank you!</review>

<review>Great place to enjoy a few tacos and a cold bottled beer or jarritos. My favorite is their Thursday special, Fish Tacos baby!
Thank you Taco Shack for being authentic and 😋delicious! Almost felt like I was in PV, MX.</review>< response>

<Review>The food was really good but as far as the customer service went it was all bad, nasty attitude and gave me the wrong drinks with my order.  I don't think I'll be back here to get food or recommend anyone at the hospital where I work at to come here,  as long as the young lady that helped me is there. We work really hard and deal with a lot in this pandemic, to have to deal with negativity when we go on lunch to pick up food. If you don't want to work that day  or have problems going on in your life just call in work but don't take it out on others who just would like to get food.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>The Taco Shack Restaurant- located in the historical Inland Empire community of Redlands,California is a great place to relax and enjoy great Mexican Cuisine with a healthy twist! They have a sparkling clean "A" rated restaurant to either eat in or convenient take-away to go orders as well!
They serve breakfast,lunch and dinners at The Taco Shack!
What really sets The Taco Shack apart from others is their freshly made tacos,tostadas,rellenos,burritos,chips,salsa bar and menudo using low salt ingredients and very fresh carne asada,al pastor,grilled chicken,ground beef,pork and vegetarian selections as well!They have delicious nacho plates that are a meal in themselves and great appetizers to start off your meal!
They also feature a classic taco salad with tasty low salt,low fat refried beans,guacamole,fresh lettuce,delicious freshly shredded cheese,your choice of meats (or no meat vegeterian!) all in a fresh and tasty flour tortilla bowl-this was super tasty! They also serve fresh fruit dishes and have a selection of deserts to complete your meal.
They have self serve soft drinks by Pepsi,horchatas,orange whip,as well as imported from Mexico bottled beverages along with a nice selection of beer from the fridge!
The servers are very friendly,courteous and offer selection suggestions for you.
The food is served promptly and is a great value for the fresh and tasty portions that you receive!
Lots of free parking and family friendly.
I had a great eating experience at The Taco Shack,Redlands,California and I would highly recommend them to anyone interested in great and healthy Mexican cuisine!

Really good fish tacos only thing is they could be a little more fried so that they were more crunchy. Other than that 👍</review>

<Review>Went Recently and they said they were out of tortillas. Which doesn’t make sense
Then after a coworker of mine goes and they had tortillas for him. Just went on Thursday again and ordered a Chile relleno burrito and they charged me and a couple mins after tell me they do not have Chile rellenos. I asked for my money back and they told me to wait and they were about 7 people in line and they were having me wait until they took almost all their orders , until I told them I was on a 30 min lunch and they had already wasted half of it and they needed to give me my money back. Also they are rude from the get go</Review>< pictures>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>After getting halfway through my burrito, I discovered hair cooked into the chili relleno!!! Upon telling them this, and them seeing the nauseous look on my face they offered me a whole new burrito! As if I wanted to be tormented by the possibility of finding more hairs! The food tastes okay, but be aware of possible hair cooked into you food. It’ll keep you nauseated at the thought of fast food for a long while. Will not be returning.</text>< Pictures>

<review>This place is ok, but I liked it better when you ordered your food from the table instead of at the counter. I LOVE Mexican food, but this is not one of my favorite places to eat. And they don't have much for Vegetarians to choose from the menu. The food is limited for us. I've had better Mexican food.</review></record></dataset><record>

Excellent Mexican food for a fair price! The fish taco Thursdays are great and very filling! They are full of flavor and the sides are great! The variety of food is very worth the visit. Expect a wait at lunch and dinner times. Highly recommended.< /text>

When I am in the mood for fast and delicious Mexican food, they are my first choice. Once they find away to prepare for their lunch rush would earn them five stars.<//Text>

I’m never going back there. Worst service ever. I called and order… She piles three large orders on top of each other which they dump over in my car when I carefully placed them on the floor. They refuse to pack your salsa for you. So when I asked about it she was rude. Never going back there.< /Text>

<review>Placed an order and patiently sat at the table expecting food to be served shortly after, ended up waiting 35 minutes after 8 people who came in after us had a11lready left happily with their food. Pretty disappointed by or visit,  I live in redlands and always try to support local buisness,  but this visit was a disappointment. Maybe I should be less patient for some street tacos and 1 burrito.</review>< gmap_id>

Even though it shares the same name as the one in downtown redlands, it does not cook the same.  The carne asada was weirdly texture, more like ground beef meatballs.  The menudo was worse though, every taste was a spoonful of salt.  I have never tasted something so salty.  It made my stomach hurt.  I will never go to the Lugonia TS ever again.<//text>

Someone from my husbands job told him about. 99 cent taco tuesday at this place. We were excited to try purchased dinner last night. I like how you can order online the hard shell chicken tacos weren't authentic didnt have the traditional crispy shell it was like la victoria, the chicken was dry and no flavor, carne asada tacos were nice size however No seasoning had to doctor it up, bean & cheese burrito was ok the beans were a bit runny, fries soggy, the fish taco was pretty good. I enjoyed That. Most likely will not be back< /Text>

< Review>
Pump #5 was not functioning, not marked as faulty.
The last 3 times I've fueled up here the squeegee holders have been empty (no window cleaner).  Southern CA is very dusty and this fringe benefit of fueling up is so cheap that not providing it is a disservice to the customers.<//Review>

I stopped in to get a soda. They have a sign saying that they will round your bill up to the nearest 5 or 10 cent level just because they don't want to give back a penny! I won't to back in!< /Review>

Oded came immediately, solved the problem before my dinner, very quickly. Really nice and funny man. A good experience. Better than a couple of others that I asked for help before. If you have any issues just give him a call.<//Text>

I called around and this company was the cheapest, he happened to be in my area so he didn't charge me a service call fee. Great guy. Highly recommend him.</review>

<text>This service is extremely fast and reliable. An hour from the time I called and the job was done.I was locked out of my car not knowing what to do, they came and got me in my car within minutes. I was ready to pay a nice amount for such great service, but to my surprise the guy asked for half the price I had in mind.

I work at Ralph's and our elevators broke down and we needed to get down to the warehouse the only problem is that the door didn't have a door knob. Odette showed up super fast was able to open the door in less than 5 minutes!! He's super knowledgeable and super nice. I would call him again if I ever need a locksmith.< /Review>

< review>
I called Locksmith Guarantee today to have him put in a new front door lock. He arrived exactly when he said he would which was very quickly after I called him. He did an excellent job and we are very happy with our new lock. He was referred to us by a friend who gave him rave reviews when i asked her for a locksmith. And while he was at our house, he even put in a new light bulb on our back door fixture. He did this as a courtesy.
His prices are very fair and he is a very sweet and friendly guy. I highly
recommend him. We will be telling all our friends about Locksmith Guarantee. I already referred him to my sister.< /review>

Oded did an amazing job. He was at my house in 20 minutes and took less than 5 minutes to get my door open. His pricing is also very affordable and he is a really nice guy. Strongly recommended if you find yourself locked out of your house.<//Text>

< Review>
This locksmith is AMAZING. He is the real deal.
We called, needing  five different locks changed at two different places . He came within a half hour. He was extremely knowledgeable and his pricing was great . Oded, finished the job quickly and with absolutely no mess.
I highly recommend  Oded @ Locksmith Guarantee!< /Review>

<review>I had the rare opportunity to meet a real professional today.  Locksmith Guarantee quickly responded to my call for help.  Oded came and within minutes was able to open my apartment door.  It turned a very frustrating situation, a locked apartment door, into an enjoyable experience.  Oded was quick, professional, and good humored....three critical qualities and the price was more than reasonable. Thank you Oded!  A++++++</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

We went out to a bar in Hollywood and I lost my keys , ubering back home SUCKS knowing someone would probably try to over charge me at nearly midnight to unlock my home door but once this guy Oded arrived it changed lol, he’s awesome very professional , fast and very fair pricing !
I’m very glad I found them and definitely will use them again when needed !<//text>

<Text>Writing a review right after a bad experience can sometimes “bite” you later but since it’s been 2 years since my first and last visit here I think it’s fair to leave a review. Now, first let me start with saying this place has gnarly technology. It’s clean and has updated equipment. Owning all the bells and whistles is only a small piece of the puzzle, the integrity is the main part. I’m like most humans on earth who take care of their teeth but could always do more flossing. With that being said, I have never had a cavity, crown, or anything other than braces back in the day. During my initial visit here I was told I had numerous cavities and was presented with a $3000 plan towards healthier teeth. The worst part was that I didn’t even have the cleaning done at all so I was charged essentially for x-rays... cool... not. I did forward those x-rays to a friend and advised that there were no known issues with my teeth so I decided to opt out of any further business with this practice. I just think it’s so unprofessional to work up an invoice when there is no need. It’s like taking a car into the shop and even when everything is smooth they want to add on hundreds of dollars to replace this or that. That’s how I felt this place conducts business... just like a mechanic shop. Sad. Save your money and seek out another dentist. Your teeth and wallet will thank you.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This was by far the best experience I’ve had at a dentist appointment. The office is so clean and modern and the staff is really kind.

<review>I finally have my molar crown after having a painful
root canal at my upper right molar.
Dr. Almario is now my go to dentist.
I will highly recommend her as she is very kind and respectful.
Her office is very clean and great atmosphere.
The staff are very nice and I really appreciate their hospitality.
I chose her because of her ratings and also is
within 2 miles from home.
I had made three appointments with her.
The first appointment was having a referral to a Endodontic Doctor for a root canal treatment.
My second appointment was for my temporary molar crown placement.
My third appointment was for my molar crown placement.
All this was within 1.5 month including the Endodontic doctor.
Overall I am satisfied with the procedure and I am eating
well with no discomfort or other abnormal symptoms.
I created future appointment with her for general check
and soon I will be following up with her for fillings.
I been paying cash and I was expecting a lot more
but is not. At least with me.
I have spend $1,250.00 for my upper molar crown In two separate payments. Regardless of the price, I am very satisfied but now I am more aware and care for oral hygene and cutting down the sugars.
More than Five stars to Dr. Almario and the staff.
Thank you very much and I look forward for more treatments.< /review>< Pics>

The best dentist I’ve ever been to! The staff is so friendly and Dr. Almario really knows what she’s doing.  I’ve had problems with fillings in the past that caused years of pain, and she created a filling for me that feels like it’s not even there! Thank you so much!</review>

Loved my experience at Dr. Almario’s office. Great staff, well greeted from when you walk in till you leave. Very cautious and clean with the pandemic going on. Not forgetting they make you feel as comfortable as they can with T.V and a cover pillow. Highly recommend this dental office, they are a great team.<//text>

Dr. Almario is excellent. Great technical skills and lovely bedside manner. I’ve had a lot of complicated dental work done over many years and she is the best dentist I’ve ever had. She is highly competent and never tries to get me to do work I don’t really need. I’ve recommended several people to her and they all love her!</review>

Dr. Almario is an excellent dentist, and has made excellent recommendations when I have needed further work. She is swift and gentle, always attentive during her work. Her staff is kind and attentive, and they make their work very personal to me — always checking in and ensuring the work done feels good and that I have everything I need. The office is also lovely and offers television in each room, which really helps pass the time during a longer appointment. I would highly recommend Efma Almario to anyone looking for gentle, honest, personalized dentistry. 😁<//Text>

Front desk went above and beyond to help me figure out if my dental insurance was covered at the office. Dental hygienist gave me probably the best cleaning I’ve ever had to date very noticeably thorough and the doctor made me feel comfortable and was very pleasant to work with regarding my treatment plan. Would highly recommend :)< /Review>

Just had first visit- staff was friendly and put me at ease. I saw a different dentist than Efma, but she was very professional and, because I have not been taking adequate care of my teeth, she found a lot of problems. She did a thorough exam, then drew up a treatment plan for all of my dental issues. The only reason for four-star review was that I don't have enough information to fully review the dentist.<//review>

I’ve been going to Dr. Efma Almario for close to a decade and every single experience I’ve had with her and her dentistry has been positive. The facilities are impecable and the staff exceptionally professional, friendly, and helpful.<//Review>

Ummm, this place is AMAZING!! Brenda and Michelle were outstanding in their professionalism but also making you feel like a friend and at home! The facility is state of the art, including TVs to watch while you’re getting worked on, Dr Almario is the SWEETEST! A true pro with a sensitive touch! Best part of it all was that my insurance covered almost everything! Thanks so much for the INCREDIBLE Experience and can’t wait to come back and get my cavities filled!!!!! Haha</Text>

<Text>I've been going to Dr. Efma Almario for nearly a year now. I've been getting cosmetic dental work done in order to achieve a beautiful smile, yet keep it functional. Throughout the entire process Dr. Efma Almario has been wonderful. She made sure I was well informed before starting the procedure, and consulted with other experts in her field to make sure we would achieve the best results. She's a dedicated and well skilled dentist who truly cares for her patients. Whenever I had a dental emergency she had me come-in, during or after business hours. She does whatever it takes to make sure all inconveniences are been taken care off as soon as possible. The office has always been clean and the staff has been amazing. Brenda, who works in the office, has been my go-to person in case I needed second opinions, which I'm very grateful for. Dr. Efma Almario has done an amazing job, and I couldn't be more happy and thankful to her, and her talented team.< /Text>< pictures>

Complete scam! You’ll get told you need very extensive and unnecessary work and that you have no other options. Avoid at all costs and find a real professional dentist not motivated by greed< /text>

<review>I have been going to Dr. Almario for over 15 years, and I will never ever leave her. She is so expert and kind and gentle, that I actually look forward to my dental visits. She has completely redefined what it’s like to go to the dentist, turning what used to be an experience filled with dread, into an occasion that’s surprisingly downright pleasurable. Her office staff is wonderful and their facilities are quite comfortable. Kudos, Salutes and Thanks to Dr. Efma Almario Dentistry. You should try her. You’ll never look back.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2c0b2785b15ef:0x933864e0c9a63699<//Gmap_id><response>None< /response><name>Jordan Wallens</name>< time>

I can't imagine a dentist's office being any better! Dr. Almario is a joy to see. I've been going to this office for almost 10 years and it's always a painless and positive experience and the staff is always friendly and kind. Highly, highly recommend going here!< /Review>

What a change to find an honest, genuine dentist who really cares about her patients and her work. The Staff are warm and friendly and the dentist was gentle and very reassuring. She took her time and seems to enjoy her work. I am mid treatment so so far so good she has done a wonderful job.<//text>

Found this place on my insurance provider's website - listed as covered by my plan. Scheduled an appointment a month and a half in advance and gave my insurance info over the phone. Was called the day before and gave my insurance info again. When I finally showed up, the person at the desk told me my insurance wouldn't cover anything, but that they would be glad to have me pay out of pocket for everything. You couldn't tell me that a month and a half before, or even the day before? Thanks for wasting my time to try and make a buck! Shady place.</Text>

Dr. Almario is awesome and her staff is friendly. I just needed to see if my pain was due to TMJ or a tooth problem.  I got my answer and more!  Because I think I finally found my dentist!  Yay!< /Review>

I have a dress!!! I was having the hardest time finding a knee- or tea-length white dress that still looked bridal. I was thrilled to find such a good selection at Simply Bridal. Luckily, I live close to their showroom and was able to visit twice in person to try on some options. I was immediately impressed by the quality of the dresses for the price. After my first appointment, they helped me make a second one so I could return with my mom and sister to make a final decision. One of the great things about dresses at Simply Bridal is that many of their short dresses are actually bridesmaid dresses in white (with no markup!). When I was at the showroom, the white sample of my dress was too small, but I was able to try on the exact same dress in my size in black. It was perfect-- the standard size fit me like a glove, so I didn't need to have the dress custom-made. I was also able to order a matching plain sash, and both the dress and sash arrived in about a month. The fit and quality are exactly what I saw in the showroom. I can't express how thrilled I was to find a place like Simply Bridal. Highly recommended!</text>

The staff were very friendly and helpful. Erika was very sweet and made me feel very comfortable. She listened to what I was looking for in a dress and pulled several styles that I really liked. I ended up finding my dress here and am very excited. The boutique is very cute and they offer champagne and water while you wait. They also have great discount options if you find the right dress during your first appointment.< /text>

When I got there, people were so happy and they were very welcoming. I have not seen any other place like that. I was going to get some ideas then I will decide from which store I should my ultimate wedding dress. It turned to be the nicest place with nicest people who helped me to choose. They did not force me to buy neither they did not push certain model to try. They showed me different ones and I tried them on which helped me to make my decision. I was so happy about their offering to help me to fit on me so I get the right impression about the dress. I was so extremely recommended to all people to go and check it out. They have pretty dress  models and bridesmaid dresses. They give discount if you are going to buy for the bridesmaids too. The employee are lovely people; they are amazing! It is worth the time and effort to go and check the store out!< /Text>

I had a wonderful experience with Simply Bridal. I used just about every one of their services including the Try-at-Home and I have a more detailed review on yelp if you want to hear about it. All the ladies at Simply Bridal were courteous and helped me along the way. Lauren was especially great and a big help in the showroom and on the phone.
I love the dress I bought (Jasmine) and it arrived clean and well sewn within about 60 days. The satin is beautiful and heavy. The dress was a phenomenal deal and I would do it again! Simply Bridal made my wedding day a little less stressful by making a beautiful dress available to me. I was skeptical about online dress shopping but Simply Bridal is the real deal!
Good luck!</Review>< gmap_id>

<rate>5</rate><review>I had a great experience at Simply Bridal. My consultant was fantastic, we discussed what I was looking for, and her first pull ended up being the dress for me. We tried on several others - but kept going back to the first. This may sound silly, but they way they cinch the dresses was super helpful -- I'm very petite and so I can have a hard time imagining what the dresses will look like when they are the right size, but they did a much better job pinning the dress than other places I had visited --which allowed me to get that feeling of the dress better. The sample dresses were all very clean and in nice condition, and the store was very clean and cute. I have to wait for September for my dress to come in -- but overall the experience has been great thus far!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<text>I just had my appointment here yesterday and it was awesome. I had someone with me the whole time bringing me different dresses and belts to try on with the dress. When I had questions about alterations she was quick to get me the answer. I ended up being torn between 4 different dresses here because they were all so beautiful yet reasonably priced! I'm so happy that I bought my dress here and I would recommend this place to all brides-to-be.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

I must admit I never stressed about the day I went wedding dress shopping... This was honestly my first pick to find "THE" dress. I actually flew from Michigan to Los Angeles to explore the Simply Bridal showroom because I had to see how everything looked on me. When I arrived I felt like all eyes were on me and was center of attention! This was an amazing feeling walking into my FIRST bridal boutique. Everyone was so honest, patient, kind and just simply FUN!!! Those were all the aspects I wanted in my wedding dress experience. I want to say I tried on OVER 10 dresses and felt right at home... I will say I finally got down to 2 dresses and it was a split with everyone and we were able to facetime my mother who began to cry seeing me in this moment.. The ladies just joined right in greeting my mother as if she were in the room... I was blessed to have been able to hold the sign with my future wedding dress saying "SHE SAID YES!" with my best friend standing right beside me.

If you are looking for a once in a lifetime experience shopping for your wedding dress while being the MOST elegant bride any man has EVER seen...This is truly the place to go!</Review>

I had originally had a dress on order at David’s Bridal and after going back and forth with them in regards to fittings and dates for my dress to arrive I decided to cancel my order with them. The follows weekend me and my mom and one of my bridesmaids went looking and I can say I was discouraged! Then we found Simply Bridal and we planned on just looking. I end up finding my dream dress for 460.00 I am so excited for my wedding in June I do have to get alteration but overall my experience was great!!!!!!< /text>< Pictures>

We went looking for dresses today. The girl that helped us was a joy. The guy behind the counter was the best. The other girl had a standing stank face the entire time we were there. We didn't let her ruin our good time but having her glare our way wasn't pleasant. The choice of dresses was great. Only thing I would have liked was if the bride was able to browse and pick out a few of her own dresses. Doesn't seem to make complete sense for the store to choose for her. It's her day. However the girl assigned to us was very accommodating. She listened, gave a little advice and most important was patient. Very much appreciated that.

For bridesmaids the selection seemed small and uneventful. It was off on another part of the store crammed on this small rack. It was hard to go through them. Felt like I was shopping the clearance rack at Kmart.

All in all it was worth the trip. We had a great time and would definitely recommend it.<//text>

<Review>I have received my dress last week and noticed it was slightly too tight. I contacted the showroom, and they advised me to take the dress to let them see how they can fix it. The store manger was being super helpful and kind. She was able to help me fix the size and rush my shipment. I love this superb customer service. I will definitely recommend my friends to there.</Review>< pictures>

This is the place to buy the dress. The dresses are so affordable and beautiful and great quality. The bridal consultants are so nice and very professional. They really listen on what you are looking for. My sister found the  most beautiful  dress on the first try. So ladies if you are looking for saying yes to the dress this is the place to go.< /text>

We came in earlier than our appointment and they were able to take us. We had an awesome bridal consultant, Maxx. He was really energetic, fun, with a great sense of humor that made the experience that much greater! It was our first place for a dress fitting and I was able to find a dress that I loved at an affordable price. He took his time with us and made the experience so enjoyable. He was very competent in this line of work and I was really happy that I came here.<//Review>

Even though I did not actually purchase my wedding dress from them, I did have dresses shipped to my home to try on. Customer service was top notch via chat and via phone. The dresses that I did try on at home, I loved. However, I actually went to a local shop to get measured so that I could order the correct size. Well, my dad went with me and wanted me to try on dresses. I did and found the perfect dress for me. I would like to thank Simply Bridal for making a stressed bride feel at ease and provided great customer service.< /review>

A big thank you and shout out to Chrissy! She made the experience memorable. I can't wait till my dress arrives in the mail!!!

<Review>While being engaged I started celebrating by eating tons of bad food and drinking lots of alcohol to the point that I gained enough weight not to fit onto my first wedding gown. 2 months away from my wedding date I started searching the web and visited a few local bridal stores, with no luck. I was so desperate I picked out a few CHEAP $ gowns to try on before my appointment at simply bridal, you get to choose 5. As soon as I walked into the store from the glass windows I spotted something shinny in the distance and I was instantly drawn to it. I had a few minutes to walk around the store and look at the dresses while my personal helper got a room ready for me to get started. The first dress I tried on was the cute shinny dress I had spotted when I walked in and I felt amazing! They have so many different sizes that you truly wont feel like there isn't an option for you at this store. The dress was a bit out of my budget but they gave me an instant discount and are willing to work with you when it comes to payments. Since my wedding is coming up soon, they charged a $25 dollar rush fee which was so cheap compared to other places! I highly recommend this place, thank you for helping me find my perfect gown in such short time.<//Review>< Rate>

<Text>I absolutely adored this place. As soon as you walk in everyone is so friendly, Haley is the one that helped me and she was so adorable and so helpful!! I truly felt cared about, and as it was my first time dress shopping i was nervous and wasn't sure about what styles i liked she was very patient with me. All of the ladies there helped pitch in different styles and gave great feedback. I felt so special and the fact that i am getting married felt so real and special trying on those dresses. They really have a great variety and selection of dresses with great prices. They have such cute accessories. Such an unforgettable experience, definitely recommend!

<Text>Thank you! I bought my dress (the Larissa gown) online (I live in Michigan) and cannot be happier with it. The packaging and directions kept the dress safe and secure. I cannot wait for my wedding day and will be able to put it back in the vacuum packaging afterwards to keep it safe. It is a stunning beauty and have been told it suits me so well. The materials are definitely worth the cost. At other places, I was looking at dresses three times the cost. Thank you for helping me make my wedding day a winter wonderland.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7cb021a60dd:0xcd9c8dac5843b0bc</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I found a great dress with Simply Bridal and wanted to do the "Try at Home" option.  I did this and it was fantastic!  I got 2 dress' to try on and they were both awesome.  I fell in love with one and will be ordering it very soon.
I called customer service and they were great; answered promptly, helpful and kind.

The price of the dress that I like went up while I thought about ordering this dress (quite a bit actually).  So that was depressing but Simply Bridal did offer a small discount to help.  So far.... I'm happy with what I see with Simply Bridal.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< username>

<text>I haven't bought my dress yet, but I ordered a 'Try-at-Home' dress and loved it!! It is well made out of quality material.
Make sure you can send it back within the required time you order it, as mine arrived within 3 days, when I was expecting 2-3 weeks. That way you don't have a rush to try to get all the ideas or people critiquing it at unexpected times. :)< /text><GmapID>0x80c2c7cb021a60dd:0xcd9c8dac5843b0bc<//GmapID><UserId.>105728122115484553659< /UserId.>< Time>

I couldn't be more disappointed with both the service and quality. When selecting a dress I tried a sample size 6 and it was huge. Had to be held on by clips. The streamstress came over and measured me as a 6. Which couldn't be the case. I typically wear size 0-2. They did this so they could purposefully upcharge alterations. I spent $700 on the dress and $1100 on the alterations. When I got the dress back there were holes in the lace sleeves. I hardly recognized it the whole garmet looked so tortured. I can't believe I spent this much money for a dress I will be ashamed to wear at my wedding.< /review>

As soon as I entered the store and met the girls at the reception, I had already a good feeling about it. I have less than 2 months to be ready with the wedding arrangements, so selecting a dress and having the fitting done is quite a challenging thing to do when you are short on time. Mo and Neakai selected the dresses, considering the delivery time, cost and my idea of what the dress should look like.
I fell in love with the first two dresses I tried on and selected one of them. That was it! Tears of happiness and the OMG-I-am-getting-married-for-real feeling. The dress arrived to me 3 days after that! It fitted perfectly, just needs adjustment of the length ( perfectly understandable).
I can't thank them enough for being such a fresh team and very helpful and delicate people.  Now I am looking forward to the big day :)</Text>

< review>
This was the first bridal salon I have visited and it was not a good experience. The staff was unfriendly and it didn't seem like they listened to my likes and dislikes which was frustrating. My consultant also seemed to be having a bad day, she had almost no personality and complained to me about having to be at work and had no energy. They basically only had white dresses and little variety. I would not recommend this shop to anyone. It was a very disappointing experience that I hope no other bride needs to go through.<//review>

I love the showroom and Erikka was amazing. Just I need to warn you ladies, the parking garage is super difficult to find if you don't live near by or come here often. I parked in what I thought was the right one. Turns out I was wrong ended up paying $24 for parking because they couldn't validate my ticket.</Text>

I had a great experience here at first and Erikka was lovely and helpful in finding me a dress. The process was easy and I did not feel pushed. Erikka was patient and friendly through the whole process of choosing "the dress."

Unfortunately, I was promised my dress would arrive within 4 months of the order being placed and it never came.  I used the online customer service support at first to inquire about my order after it was supposed to arrive and was told my order was on hold and was never given an explanation before the representative left the conversation. Then, I called the store during normal business hours and it took a few tries to even get a hold of someone in the store. Once I was able to get through, I was told there was an delay with my order and my dress hadn't even been made yet. She told me they would rush my order but it would still take a couple months (probably because the dresses come from overseas).

At this point I was frustrated and not even excited about my dress so I asked for a refund.  The company returned my money, fortunately, but overall I was disappointed with the communication and how my order was handled.<//Review>

Very cute bridal shop. Dresses ranged from 99 to 2000 very inclusive in pricing. Also the staff goes above and beyond to help you. And the seamstress is an angel.<//Text>

<pictures>None</pictures><text>The selection of dresses was disappointing. All dresses had the same lace that was a bit crude looking, it reminded me of my grandma's curtains. Also the well meaning staff just kept bringing out the same type of dresses even when specifically told that it was not what we were looking for. Also they served sparkling wine out of those small plastic translucent cups, like the ones that you get at In nOut when you ask for water, lol.<//text>< Response>

Sunday afternoon with my sisters and we walked in a bit skeptical of finding a dress. I had previous bad experiences at a few other places, and what I liked off the bat was the different styles that Chrissy picked out for me. I brought photos in case, but having someone help me close to my body size and figure really helped me gain confidence. l was immediately comfortable with Chrissy, even when my sister's oohh and aww'd all the dresses I tried, but didn't wow me. My little sister was a bit demanding and the ladies at Simply Bridal smiled and tried to find what she was suggesting they pull for me to try on. When we hadnt found anything after about 6 different dresses, styles werent working fir me, and I was about to give up, because a gal can only take so much "barbie", Chrissy said she had 1 more dress up her sleeve. Low and behold, it was The Dress!!! Glad to have found it and the price was right, after 20% off and all was good in bridal land!

Thanks ladiess for helping me find the Dress!

All in all the experience my friend and I had was a great one and I'd definitely recommend this store to anyone who wants to find a unique wedding dress that is not produced by the blood and tears of underpaid children.< /text>

They prevent certain people from getting housing. They only want money, and are very very racist.
So, understanding that people who work here have to deal with a lot, doesn't make it okay for them to be racist. And being, said nobody that stay here should have to remain grateful for a place to live when they are being racist. If it is understood that you cannot change your skin color, then it should be understood for everybody even white people. A white person who was never racist,  will be discriminated against here and  because they are reversed- racist here and think that is okay. And even worse they don't see the anger or resentment that they have, but will tell that person that they are angry and resentful. Maybe nobody would be angry if you were nice to them. And also stop telling the cops to give people tickets and bring people here for sleeping outside. They don't want to be here, they are mistreated and bullied, threatened, also hit,  because they let the other residents hit them that are crazy and they give the housing and accuse them of lying if they say anything, They will also come and stare at you when you are in the shower, and laugh at you, pretending to be looking for someone when they are not. I had to go and buy a gym membership because of it. That's not cool. Its fun for them to mistreat people.< /text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>This place doesn't deserve any stars At all. Staff supports the theivery behavior of there clients. They even share the proceeds when clients sell the stolen goods. The staff gives away clients storage units before they even leave.  The security guard at the village reserve the clinic for residents only.  My doctor wrote a note that my volunteering is therapy and security over rides doctors orders. Clients commit attempted murder on the men's floor and the behavior is supported by the staff with open arms. If there is any prejudice out there the village honors it.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>I like Father Joes Villages. It is a good place. My case manager there was super nice and everyone was very friendly and helpful, and the food is not bad. They also have an onsite clinic where I was able to get my Suboxone and other services. I would recommend Father Joes to any single person just needing a stepping stone to whatever's next. Hopefully permanent housing, right?</Text>< time>

I had to stay there once. Was treated with dignity and respect. Of course there are rules to follow and some are resentful of these rules, it is for these individuals that rules are necessary. As for these wild claims I see in some of these"reviews" I highly doubt any of them.<//text>

Way too many security guards that just stand around in a large group and joke around. Maybe spend less money on security and more on actual services.<//text>< date>

There were and probably still are staffed by those convicted of felon crimes.
The staff threatened me with blades, death threats, threats of robbery, threats of other beatings, burglary, false complaints etc.
They are also involved in gang conspiratory crimes such drug sale and trafficking of methamphetamines, cocaine, heroine etc., child trafficking for  sexual abuse etc. with the Saint Vincent DePaul Security who use aliases and have been convicted of felony crimes, local San Diego Police, elements of the FBI which includes U.S. attorneys, State Police, etc.
They also housed sexual offenders illegally at the Shelter for the homeless short and long term.
I am an honorably discharged veteran of the USA military, and I am not a felon.
Many of these crimes were caught on tape with audio yet the local, state and federal government won't release this information to the public through the press or to the general public.</review>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>Took my 3 year old red Doberman in when she was old enough to get her ears done, they came out beautiful. I took my blue Doberman and have the same results. Very reliable, friendly, educated, patient, and true. If you want your dogs ears cropped you have to be able to make the appointments after or else your putting your dog at risk. Like they told me"keep your investment in shape" as in if your going to do this then make sure your able to come in the next few days to get them checked up on and such. They are good with making accommodations to make sure your able to make your appointments if you ask. Very pleased them. My mom would take her show dogs here since FOREVER.

Took my dog in right away. Took the to  to explain what was wrong with my dogs eye. Prescribed two medications. Showed me the problem area on my pets eye. Explained eveything he did every step of the way. The visit did not feel rushed at all. Did not try to sell additional unnecessary products or services. I will be returning in five days for a follow-up visit.

I am so happy to find a quality, experienced vet with great staff.</review>

Heidi, looks like an excellent crop job but seems like poor after care for the ear on the right.  My dog was cropped by the same doctor and his are perfect but then again I did my part by keeping his ears dry and changing his postings once a week.  Elm vet might the best place in the valley to get your dogs ears cropped.< /text>

<resp>None</resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures><review>I had scheduled an appointment at elm veterinary hospital and due to unfortunate family issues back home and Christmas passing (while back home in MO) I was unable to make my appointments. I understand that is in every way my fault. However when I called today and tried to make a further appointment the vet Answered. He was very polite and transferred me to the front desk to Keisha, at that time my whole call flipped upside down were I was greeted with the worst attitude she could have given. I guess since we had missed our past appointment there was hostility toward me as if she New me personally As she refused my buisness. I understand why after she slammed her reasoning behind the refusal in my ear. But I do not appreciate the attitude toward me. I personally think no matter what the circumstances you should always give and speak respectfully toward clients of ANY buisness. But Keisha obviously thinks differently, to top it off I ask for her name so that I may contact the head of the office. After pronouncing her name for me to hear correctly she begins to say I have threatened her and hangs up the phone on me? I’m not sure how elm vet conducts there buisness but I’m sure by the difference in attitudes between the front desk and the actual vet that Keisha is not a very good representation. I do not recommend this vet to anyone that appreciates respect and kindness with there visit. And I would appreciate an apology from Keisha at the front desk since we are apparently on first name basis.. thank you.</review>< Rate>

< Review>
I had scheduled an appointment at elm veterinary hospital and due to unfortunate family issues back home and Christmas passing (while back home in MO) I was unable to make my appointments. I understand that is in every way my fault. However when I called today and tried to make a further appointment the vet Answered. He was very polite and transferred me to the front desk to Keisha, at that time my whole call flipped upside down were I was greeted with the worst attitude she could have given. I guess since we had missed our past appointment there was hostility toward me as if she New me personally As she refused my buisness. I understand why after she slammed her reasoning behind the refusal in my ear. But I do not appreciate the attitude toward me. I personally think no matter what the circumstances you should always give and speak respectfully toward clients of ANY buisness. But Keisha obviously thinks differently, to top it off I ask for her name so that I may contact the head of the office. After pronouncing her name for me to hear correctly she begins to say I have threatened her and hangs up the phone on me? I’m not sure how elm vet conducts there buisness but I’m sure by the difference in attitudes between the front desk and the actual vet that Keisha is not a very good representation. I do not recommend this vet to anyone that appreciates respect and kindness with there visit. And I would appreciate an apology from Keisha at the front desk since we are apparently on first name basis.. thank you.< /Review>

<username>Laura Willers< /username><text>Excellent Crop Job! Dr Eib has cropped my dobie's ears since 1976. I've always been happy with the results. Yes, Elm Vet Hospital is not fancy, but that has never interfered with the quality of care. My last dobie was in ear splints for 5 months. It had nothing to do with Dr Eib's skill. It was just the way my puppy was. Owner perseverance and patience is essential for good results. My dobie gets all her ongoing care at Elm Vet Hospital, too. All staff are competent, knowledgeable and friendly.< /text>< UserId.>

<Text>Nice to have a Great tasting Korean BBQ chicken place nearby. I believe to get anything of this quality, you would need to live more towards Korea town or the San Gabriel Valley. This review is based on two of my visits during the While Covid ordeal. I want to first cover how easy it is to order either on the phone or online. Keep note that if you do try ordering online they do have 10% off during this review for first time users. Ordering is really easy either on the phone or online. Everything is pretty self explanatory, and you could even write some notes there if you wish to alter an order. There is Apple Pay, and they will notify you by text that your order is ready, so you don’t really need to wait around. Super convenient, to get your food and get out.

Food
I have tried the whole chicken (you can pick two versions) we tried the golden chicken and the secret spicy. The Secret spicy is SO good. The only sauce I have tried so far that I wasn’t a big fan of, was the honey garlic, I believe it had a bit too much garlic. The kimchi fried rice was mediocre in my opinion, and to note, the fries are the steak fries.

Things I would recommend :
Soy Garlic Wings- these are BURSTING with flavor. You just gotta get these, and you will easily come back for more.

So the second time I went back, I had to order the wings again, and I have yet to try the other things on the menu. Goal is also to try the Duk Bukki as I am a fan of rice cakes. I hope I made it easier for anyone that was considering this place, I hope to update my review soon on other items. Until then!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I ordered a 2 chicken here about year ago. I would say this is great taste.  I have thought other Korean chicken places where having a bad review because it was foreign style and people are giving a bad reviews. But after seeing bbq review it's not just different culture food. It's about how great food taste and service are toward there customers. I will came to bbq Korean chicken in the future.< /Text>

<review>Wonderful NEW taste in Chino hills, spicy Korean chicken, made to order, with lots of tasty side dishes to choose from.  Ordered their secret spicy chicken and the spicy sweet combination was delicious and left us sweating a bit, the rice cakes were also delicious and we were full from sharing a half order with rice.  Service was friendly and responsive though the food takes a bit to come out since it's made to order.  Had a great experience here and we will be back</review>< pics>

In the past, I always enjoyed eating it because it was delicious, but a few months ago, I received old salad and smelly pickles, and next time I ordered chicken again, it was the worst. It's not crispy, it's old, it's soggy, and I ordered the whole chicken, and it was in pieces, and now it's goodbye to you.</review>

We placed two orders of wings on the Postmates. The Gangnam style is soggy one, we don’t enjoy that much. But we do like the Honey garlic - crispy one.<//Review>

love the chicken!  sadly can't say the same thing about the fries. we asked for fries well-done (extra chrispy) and were told "we don't make well-done fries".   Need to get your French fries game in order (not to mention  customer service game) to get a 5.  Has anyone EVER been told "we dont make well-done fries" by any fast food place??!!  Went to Bravo Burger to get my 5 star well-done fries.<//text>

<text>Was looking for something different to try and found this gem. I am not sure if this is the same brand as the one on the korean drama Crash landing on you but it was superb. We ordered the original whole chicken (even though it didnt have the spicy sign, we still found it a tiny bit spicy), honey garlic wings, cheesling, and kimchi fried rice. I gotta say all of them were delicious and I highly recommend.< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1594871477909, 'text': 'Thank you for your kinds comments.

(Translated by Google) Good flavor, excellent crunchy and flavor is delicious my first time here, very kind but you have to call to place your order so as not to wait too long but it is worth it because the flavor is different. I found out watching a kdrama of #leeminho #thekingofeternalmonach

(Translated by Google) It's juicy, moist and soft like chicken in Korea. Tempura clothes are not Korean BBQ. If you put on a thicker batter, less salt, and a little bit of chewy crisp (now it's a long-fried batter), it's a bit like a Korean chicken. Seasoned chicken sauce is very similar to Korea. Delicious. I can often hear you.

한국에서 먹는 치킨처럼 육즙이 잘 살아있고, 촉촉하며 부드럽습니다. 튀김옷은 한국 비비큐정도는 아니에요. 좀 더 두꺼운 튀김옷을 입히고, 염지를 덜 하고, 씹을때의 바삭함이 좀 더 가벼우면(지금은 좀 오래튀긴듯 딱딱한 튀김옷이었습니다) 한국 치킨맛과 완전히 비슷해질듯 합니다. 양념치킨 소스는 한국과 거의 비슷해요. 맛있습니다. 종종 들릴듯 하네요.</text>

(Translated by Google) I ordered two kinds of chicken and tteokbokki with cheese, followed by a mild golden olive chicken, followed by a honeycomb chicken with a great mix of seasonings, and usually a tteokbokki (which wasn't much irritating). It was so good that I felt the consideration of the boss who gave me each one in order to enjoy the original taste of each chicken. The tteokbokki is served as a soup on rice cake and the added mozzarella cheese is not melted until the last, so it was so delicious that I ate it with a spoon. Korean chicken flavor is also the right answer for those who love chicken. Thank you. 😍

치킨 두 종류 그리고 떡볶이를 치즈 추가해서 주문했는데 맛이 순한 황금올리브치킨부터 나오고 그 다음 양념이 기가막히게 잘 조합된 허니갈릭 순살 치킨 그리고 대체로 맛이 강한 떡볶이(많이 자극적이지는 않아 좋았습니다) 순으로 나와서 각 치킨의 본연의 맛을 헤치지 않고 즐길 수 있도록 차례대로 내어 주신 사장님의 배려가 느껴져서 너무 좋았습니다. 그리고 떡볶이는 뚝배기에 국물떡볶이로 나오고 추가한 모짜렐라 치즈도 마지막까지 굳지 않고 녹아 있어서 너무 맛있게 숟가락으로 국물하나 남김 없이 맛있게 싹 먹었습니다. 역시 한국의 치킨 맛은 치킨을 사랑하는 사람들에게 정답입니다. 감사합니다. 😍<//Review>

<Text>Last Edit: Had an appointment scheduled with Andrea right before my wedding but when I got there, I got another girl. I went in for my usual classic fill but they looked very different when she was done. Not bad but definitely not classic. Just wasn't what I asked for or wanted. Went to my wedding with lashes that were a bit too dramatic for my taste. After my wedding I decided to get the lashes removed at the Lakewood location and I was horrified to see that many of my lashes had been pulled out. I felt it happen at my last fill appointment but I was hoping it wasn't as bad as I thought but it was much much worse. I won't be returning to this location.

Original: This was such a great experience. I love the way my lashes feel and look. It was so relaxing i was even able to nap during my session. This place was so clean and everyone was so nice. Silvia did my full set of natural classic silk eyelashes. I will definitely be returning. They're so beautiful and not too bold. I love them.
Edit: Got my lashes done by Andrea. Great job just as good as Silvia. Love coming to get my lashes done here.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>I got classic eyelashes. So far, so good. However, one was hanging and fell off after I left and was checking them out in car  mirror. It was a cluster of three. Not sure if they all are.  The last place I went used singles. I just hope the rest are pretty secure and don't fall off too soon. They look good for now. Not too flashy. Classic is a more natural look. The table was comfortable and Tyler was quick. However, they have soft music playing where they apply eyelashes and different upbeat music in the waiting area. You can hear them both. I'd prefer to hear one or the other. Everyone was nice though.<//Review></record>

1st time eyelash extension client. Andrea is very professional & thorough. Would love to play with the length variation upon next visit with less volume & a more natural look. Lashes look & feel amazing so much better than strip lashes which I've used for years! Highly recommend!< /Text>

Brittany helped me continue to build and enhance my lips with Juvederm. She’d did everything she could to make the process as painless as possible and I am extremely happy with results. She listened to my specific requests for shape and size and I would recommend her to anyone interested in lip filler. I’ll definitely be back to have Brittany micro blade my eyebrows.<//review>

I loved the service, Emilyn was very kind and it was my first time getting eyelashes and I wasn’t disappointed. I will be getting more natural looking ones though. These are a little dark, so we will see if I get used to them or not, but there is nothing wrong with them, they’re beautiful and curly. I just want less next time. It’s nice to learn what looks good on us. Don’t be afraid to make a mistake ! That’s how we will know what looks good on us, but overall I do like them.</Text>

Very professional and individualized service, customization specifically to me. Very important to me for as I have hypothyroidism and have lost most of my eyebrows and depend on cosmetic support for natural enhancement.

I have been having my eyebrows tattooed, retouched, micro bladed and now shaded for over 20 years with several providers and I feel this time with Ashley was the best treatment I’ve ever received.

I highly recommend Ashley and Eye Candy Lash & Brow Bar.

I love how conveniently located they are too.

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>Long story short... if you decide to come here, research your artist. They don’t have customer level at point where their prices are. They will push You to tip them. Don’t use Groupone. This place is not kid friendly. I got my eyelashes done by Andrea. I showed her pic of what I was looking for. Her work didn’t looked like what I initially wanted but she did a good job. I was happy with the result. She mentioned that I can come back for additional fillings, to repair lashes that falls out. I did came back and left with bloody eye. I did send her friendly tone message asking her what could be done as more lashes came out. 2 days later no response, no interest dealing with a client whatsoever. The bloody eye was a chemical burn caused by the glue. I hardly write bad reviews but this attitude   is to me a sign of lack of professionalism. Paying for service here was like throwing money out of a window.<//review>< Pics>

So I decided to get my eyebrows microshaded.... it was something I have been struggling with for a long time since my natural eyebrows are so light blonde and scarce. (Even in the before pic now they were dyed/tinted.) My eyebrows always took me the longest out of all my other makeup and I wouldn’t leave the house without them on. Sometimes I would spend hours infront of the mirror trying to get them just right, getting frustrated and making my skin raw from the constant use of makeup wipes. I never thought I would get a cosmetic procedure, I always believed in loving yourself as u are, and although I could preach it, I couldn’t believe it myself. I spent 4 years researching and deciding whether or not to do it and honestly I was so happy with the result that I started crying. This makes a big difference in my self confidence and I couldn’t be happier! Thank you GiGi at Eye Candy Lash & Brow Bar! She did an amazing job</review>

I’ve had my lashes done a few times by different people. Gigi, is hands down the best! The most informative, and very patient. She is the only one who actually took the time to probe questions and understand what look I was going for. I would recommend her to everyone, and will definitely be coming back!< /Text>

Amazing experience! It was my first time getting my eyebrows microbladed, and Gigi explained the whole process and what to expect before she started. It’s obvious that she loves her job and takes a lot of pride in making sure you have a great experience. I couldn’t recommend Eye Candy more highly.<//review>

WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I had bought a Groupon for this place and PRIOR to purchasing it, I had called them directly the day before to make sure they have availability for the following day when I needed my lashes done and also that I was still able to redeem this Groupon for the $99 volume set they advertised. I explained to them that I HAD purchased a Groupon a while back in the past with them for the same thing so I wanted to make sure it would still be valid if I purchased it again. She pulled up my account (where it evidently shows I HAD purchased a Groupon in the past with them) said yes, they would still honour the advertised priced and the Groupon had to be used at the Newport Beach location. I asked her if I should just come in and they would honour the price then or if I was required to purchase the Groupon again and she told me to purchase the Groupon again and at that time we booked my appointment for the following day... Fast forward to today, I just drove over a half hour one way to get to their Newport Beach location, only to find out that they decided to not honour the Groupon after I had already purchased it and called to verify it was okay and was TOLD to purchase it by the girl I spoke with. I didn't bring my debit or credit cards with me because I had assumed since I had already purchased the Groupon, I didn't really have to pay for anything other than cash for a tip at the end... I explained the entire situation to them and my phone call with their front desk girl the day before and expressed that I had actually cancelled an existing appointment with another lash place to come to their business instead after finding out I could purchase the Groupon again. After all of this, she said we'll do a classic set for you, but not the volume you were expecting when you purchased the Groupon... Wasn't happy with this, but I guess I didn't have a choice at this point... Then 2 minutes later said, never mind we can't do a classic either. Nothing we can do, you will have to contact Groupon and try to get your money back.

I'm leaving for a trip tomorrow and now I will not have my lashes done because of this... So frustrating as they refused to do NOTHING about this or help in anyway even though they completely mislead me or made a mistake and told me to purchase the Groupon again... Now I'm hoping to get refunded by Groupon for this. Worst customer service I've ever experienced in my life. This is exactly why I called the day before to verify all of this to make sure there wouldn't be any problems. Biggest waste of time EVER!!<//review>

<text>A wonderful veterinarian business in Sebastopol. They offer vet services, health/med products for your animals, nail grooming, immunizations and emergency services. They also do house calls. And offer boarding for cats. We have come here to get flea and tick medication for our dogs. The front desk ladies are super helpful and attentive. It's located in a cute what appears to be Victorian style home across and down the street from CVS. The parking in their backlot can be limited and a little tricky to park.< /text>< user>

Have been going to dr Waldo for over 15 years. Professional and straight to the point. Doesn’t try to sell on extra services. Trustworthy. Plus he helps with dogma animal rescue which is all the more reason to support this business!</review>

<text>I thank all the staff in Animal Kingdom Veterinary, particularly Dr Michael Waldo.
Dr. Waldo was calm and knowledgeable. He answered all my questions without any rush. He was warm and gentle with Oliver, my cat. I felt very supported during this difficult time.</text></record>

I have been going to my old vet for over 10 years and I was so ready for a change due to poor customer service. I was reluctant to change because my vet is down the road from where I live so it was very convenient,  but I know my pets weren't getting the best care. With encouragement from a  customer who has been taking her pets for years to Dr. Waldo, I decided to make the change and it was the best thing I ever did. I just can't say enough about Andrea and Dr. Waldo. I should have done this years ago!< /text>

Animal Kingdom has been a godsend to our rescue. They help care for the many animals we rescue with severe health problems, treat every animal with kindness, and put up with the crazy flow of rescue. Thank you Animal Kingdom!< /Review>

I went here and just pulled what appears to be half of a toothpick out of my mouth when I was eating my rolled tacos. As you can see from the pictures, this isn't small & almost stuck in the roof of my mouth. I called and asked if they used toothpicks because I found one in my food & they hung up on me & now won't answer the phone. I will be following up with public health in the morning. I have an autoimmune disorder. I will be following up with my doctor tomorrow.< /text>

Place is so good.  Rolled tacos are bomb.  Rice and beans are some of the best around. Quick with the right quality/ price point.  Did I mention it's authentic?<//Review>

<name>Carlos Castro</name><UserId.>104357589447472426724< /UserId.><Text>It saddens me to say this but this was the 1st time I was not happy with my burrito I purchased from a great local Mexican Restaurant.

I ordered the Carne Asada Burrito no salsa and a LG rice drink no ice, and after a few bites of this great burrito I thought I purchased I found all it had was Guac, Meat and the tortilla. The meat was over salted and dry, the guacamole was good but definitely could of used some vegetables,rice, sour cream, lettuce and tomatoe but I guess that's the difference between $8.50 and $9.50..

Well other than that the over all look of the place was good but they need to fix the heighth bar for tall cars because it looks like its taken some hits.

Still my favorite place to go but maybe I'll have to be more specific and just stick to the Super Burrito to get the extra fixens.<//Text><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<Review>While it's not "authentic" Mexican food, it's an okay substitue. Like store-bought sushi vs. restaurant.
For the 10 years Adalberto's has been part of my regular diet I have no real complaints about the food. However, compared with a genuine taqueria , the meals definitely lack in flavor complexity.
The cost is fair and the service is 24 hours; so they're that always-on service that is hard to find in the restaurant industry. Be advised, 3am orders take a considerable amount of waiting time out at the drive-through window. At least they're probably making sure it's all heated to correct temperature.
I would give 4 stars, but customer service here is pretty much shitt; so 3 seems fair.< /Review>< date>

BEWARE...DO NOT EAT HERE. Ordered a simple bean and cheese burrito at 8:45 on 2/3/21 and the beans are completely sour and spoiled. I called to advise them of the issue. Did not call to complain or get a refund but just to let them know and the woman who answered laughed and said thank you. They had no care in the world. If the beans are bad then I can only imagine what else has expired. They do not care about public health. Read the Yelp reviews on this place and hopefully you will not waste your time and money at this location. Zero stars if I could.<//text>

<text>Always busy but always open. They are open for both walk-in and drive-in orders. Just make sure to be very clear when speaking into the drive up speaker as they don't always hear the order correctly. They really should update that mic which is why I've got them listed at a 3 because you do have to check your order before getting too far away. Otherwise, typical Adalberto's food and service.</text></record></dataset><record>

For those craving the flavor of SoCal Mexican food, with crispy rolled tacos with guac, big cheesy bean burritos, machaca, crispy fried tacos, and some simple good spicy red or green hot sauce, this chain is the only one in my 20+ years living and searching in northern CA that truly pushes all those buttons. It is NOT like what you get at any other Mexican joint in NorCal. You will not get a super burrito with rice and lettuce on it. You will NOT get soft tiny street tacos where the fillings fall out if you don't use all your fingers to pinch it together. You WILL get deliciously cheesy and crispy satisfying food at a reasonable price.< /Text>

Looking for overpriced Taco Bell food? Look no further, spend $25 on two plates.. and expect them to want to charge you $1.50 when you ask for chips.
My husband got a “steak” salad which is just ground beef. And I got over salty canned red salsa enchiladas with a side of what tastes like canned beans with the cheese not even melted.
Disgusting.<//review>

< Review>
This was pretty good. I have no complaints about the food. I was on my way home and slid in here. I'll be back for more. I've been to this location before and it is pretty solid. Tad on the greasy side but not bad at all. I expect that with Mexican food.< /Review>

Disappointed. Very much so. My family & I go in late afternoon, day before Labor Day. My hubbz wants to sit inside cuz our car a/c wasn't working good...too bad!! This Aldalberto's HAD NO A/C-NOT EVEN STANDALONE FANS for their customers comfort!! We brush that aside. We order 1 carne asada taco-hubbz loved it, 1 shrimp taco-hubbz hated it, 2 tortas-my daughter & I hated it. The tortas-my had NO TOMATOES, NO CABBAGE, NO ONIONS, NO SLICED JALAPEÑOS...IT FELL APART ON US!! No FREAKEN taste! The pictures show bits of tomatoes  & onion ONLY cuz I took their sub-par salsa & added it myself! I'm mexxy-american...I COOK GOOD...this..this place...yuck! Do not go there, just go Denny's across the street(our1st choice).< /text>

<Review>Our favorite place to swing by for a meal or pick up something quick from the drive thru. Love the rolled tacos. Bomb salads! Breakfast burritos! Ask for potatoes and they put fries in it! Yummy! Fabulous salsa bar. Friendly staff. Most delicious Jamaica tea I've ever had! Burritos are ginormous! You will hurt yourself if you eat it all so save some for later! I make 3 meals out of one bean and cheese burrito!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Rude service from lady taking my order. However an eye opener. They messed up my order so I had to walk back in when I noticed that no one was wearing gloves. First thought was disgusting how dare they especially with everything going on in the world today. Then I noticed the lady at the register, who also handles the food playing with her phone. Long story short my wife took a couple of bites of her torta and tossed it. Just to be safe we tossed over 20$ of food in the trash. Thanks Alberto I think we are done with restaurant/fast food for ever. Not worth the risk.</review><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809b1f1b41a83e67:0xc50b77c9d6bbf66a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Good food for a Great price!  The breakfast menu is fantastic and my wife and I go there on morning dates. And for those who want an (almost) gluten-free option, they will put a breakfast burrito in a bowl for no charge and leave the tortilla out of it. It’s not the best on atmosphere, pretty simple and basic. But the food and service is good and they have a chips and salsa bar to fill to your hearts delight.<//Review>

<Review>Disappointed. Very much so. My family & I go in late afternoon, day before Labor Day. My hubbz wants to sit inside cuz our car a/c wasn't working good...too bad!! This Aldalberto's HAD NO A/C-NOT EVEN STANDALONE FANS for their customers comfort!! We brush that aside. We order 1 carne asada taco-hubbz loved it, 1 shrimp taco-hubbz hated it, 2 tortas-my daughter & I hated it. The tortas-my had NO TOMATOES, NO CABBAGE, NO ONIONS, NO SLICED JALAPEÑOS...IT FELL APART ON US!! No FREAKEN taste! The pictures show bits of tomatoes  & onion ONLY cuz I took their sub-par salsa & added it myself! I'm mexxy-american...I COOK GOOD...this..this place...yuck! Do not go there, just go Denny's across the street(our1st choice).</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>Bummer burrito. Went back to get a new one 2 mins after I left because their #20 burrito was literally dripping wet. Gross. When I went back to explain the problem, the guy said “what do you want?”  Lol.  Is having a burrito that dripped all over me OK?

Here is a picture of my new burrito, but it’s missing the guacamole which I also paid for. Ridiculous.</Text><gmap_id>0x809b1f1b41a83e67:0xc50b77c9d6bbf66a< /gmap_id>< user>

I love Aldabertos, it's one of my favorite Mexican restaurants to eat at and whenever I visit Sacramento or Stockton I make a mandatory trip to eat there. Food is amazing and the portions are huge, always leave there 100% satisfied.< /Text>

Adalberto's is the perfect CV-19 comfort food run. Order at the drive-thru, eat at home, no physical contact. The super nachos and chicken tacos hit the spot!</Review>

We would drive all the way from SF for their crazy good burritos and carne asada fries.  15 years later and all their locations do not disappoint.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< gmapID>

<review>I was okay with the poor attitude of the drive-through worker and willing to look past the  crackly, tinny, and barely audible drive-through speaker. I was even willing to overlook being charged for an item I didn't order. If the food had been decent this would be a 3-4 star review, but no. The food wasn't even close to decent. Taco Bell may as well have a Michelin star compared to this place. I want to call the food horse manure, but calling it that would be a grave insult to horses.< /review><rating>1< /rating>< Gmap_id>

This place puts the poquito in burrito. Ordered a #24 breakfast burrito. I’ve had bigger rolled tacos. For $6.25 + $3 for a drink, I expected so much more and was completely disappointed. Never, ever again.</Review>

Really great food. I love the tacos, and the number 24 burrido. Chips are good, just make sure you grab some salt as they don't salt them most the time. 4 stars is just because they get my order wrong sometimes. Anyways good place to try.<//Review>

<Text>The asada fries are my favorite. French fries, finely chopped asada meat, Mexican cheese, cheddar cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.
This is one of the most delicious meals they have. I usually order this and it certainly is delicious. The restaurant is always clean and the food is well priced.
I love Adalberto's!< /Text>< Resp>

Really great food. I love the tacos, and the number 24 burrido. Chips are good, just make sure you grab some salt as they don't salt them most the time. 4 stars is just because they get my order wrong sometimes. Anyways good place to try.< /text>

I love the food but they dont really care about the state it's in. I've had 3 poorly wrapped burritos fall apart on me. Also, the employees way too kurt. Their attitude seems like they just want you to get out of there so they can move on with their lives. Not very friendly. If I could rate food and experience separate then I'd give food 4 and experience 1.</review>

Love the concept of this Restaurants. the burritos don't have rice and beans, the tacos  are huge, the flavor is fresh, the salsa bar has tortillas chips, and there is several choices for your meats.<//text>

So good. Prices appear high, but are justified - the Super Burrito at around $9 definitely edges out a Chipotle burrito in both size and taste - you really get what you pay for! I really enjoyed the ingredients in my burrito and their proportion, as there was quite a lot of asada, beans, and guacamole included (along with brown rice, lettuce, and the complimentary salsa/sauces).</Text>

ADALBERTOS is a great quick Mexican food restaurant. There are several iterations of this place around the Sacramento area but all are consistently good.
Deborah rito's are great, their service is friendly and their prices are fair.< /review>

Service is getting worse and worse. My husband 24 had such hard pieces of bacon which were inedible. My special ordered meal when ordered with plain beef is messed up 9/10 times. Used to be good service and food.< /text>

The pace you want and need to go after a night out drinking. Just get a carne asada super burrito with a side of pico it will last 2 meals easy.<//Review>

I guess they decided to close their grill to clean it instead of having some good common sense practices at 24 hour business. Tried waiting and they actually said that the cooks were mad and refuse to make anything. For mediocre food they sure are rude. Don't waste your time!!!!!!!!</review>

What can I say delicious Mexican food in a fast-food format. You always get a quality meal on the go, with generous portions and minimal wait time.< /text>

Food is okay, too expensive though. After spending over $7.24 for a quesadilla I asked for one more hot sauce and they wanted to charge me $.25 more for each one. That's nickel and dimming after overcharging.  I won't be coming back.<//text>

Anyways. There was a huge hair in my coworkers quesadilla and my shrimp burrito was basically soup wrapped in a tortilla. Salsa, flavorless.
Chips, flavorless

<Text>K... lady at the counter taking our order, hates her job Never once said your welcome or gave any response to any of my "thank you"s and gave off a negative vibe. I didnt want to ask for a refill on my soda bc of it. (Maybe im just being a baby though.)
Anyways. There was a huge hair in my coworkers quesadilla and my shrimp burrito was basically soup wrapped in a tortilla. Salsa, flavorless.
Chips, flavorless
Lunch, probably never again. Sorry.... but not really.< /Text><Rating>1< /Rating><Name>Josh Guillen</Name>< Gmap_id>

Bar none. I just had a chicken quesadilla and a Pepsi and, my, my, my it was just like the one by my house in Santa Ana. They use the BIG flour tortilla y the freshest chicken and the best cheese (even better than that free gov't cheese!). It was fried just right to melt in your mouth and the chicken was perfect. And a Pepsi is Pepsi is a Pepsi, but the PRICE homes. It's just the best for the price. So, get after out if you're down for some great grub. Mexicano style...! Mucho gusto!< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x809b1f1b41a83e67:0xc50b77c9d6bbf66a< /gmap_id></record>

The food is always good here. The 1.50 for to go chips is kinda lame, but I'll still go. Their salsa bar is limited, but tasty. The pico de gallo mixed with their avacado salsa is delicious. They make the best horchata. Super creamy with the perfect amount of cinnamon and rice. Great place for stoners cause their open 24/7.<//Review>

This place gets 5 stars for a few reasons. Consistency. Food is always good. Not the most amazing, but always good. They are always open 24 hours a day. Carne Asada Fries, nuff said. Huevos Rancheros, #23 breakfast burritto, shrimp burritto, chicken quesadilla, are just a few of my favorites. Also they are fast, most of the time. At the very least you'll not be disappointed, and that's the most we can expect from anybody or anything. Go inside and get the Avocado Salsa. Mmmmmmmm< /text>

Try the steak and potato breakfast burrito.  Instead of steak, substitute for carnitas; it's great!</Text>

<username>Tracey Wagner< /username><time>1497743182608</time><rating>3</rating><review>Well, I've been around, and I know my food, menus, *prices* and *VALUE*.  So while Adalbertos is good/delicious, let's face it the prices are high like everywhere the past 2 years or more. I'm new to Adalbertos Folsom, moved here January, I'm just 2 blocks over.  In March I came in one quiet rainy weeknight. Ordered 2 wet bean burritos to go -- super easy right? The lobby staff was one woman who came and went about 3 times after taking my order (but this nite she "went" more than came back out). And the young guy was two feet over tending to the silverware the entire time. 20-25mins later the lady came out & she didn't hide her surprise -- I was still waiting for 2 BEAN Burritos no meat. 25minutes.  The guy was like, uhhhh..... and I knew right there there was a mess up by their whispered exchange. My food was ready probably 15-20mins prior.  There was an apology but I felt cheated. I feel One burrito should have been reimbursed or they should have had the Manager validate my receipt for a return visit for a like item, something. Why? Because sure enough when I got home 60seconds later & popped the kids (no foil) the food was cold. Not warm not lukewarm, but cold to barely lukewarm. No sides or chips&salsa thrown in the box, but $19 dollars for two cold wet burritos.  I haven't been back since. Not a good value. Not the best customer service that nite.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Service: Holy smokes was it fast.
Food: Tried the Carne Asada super burrito. Meh. Nothing special - I was expecting way more. (I've had some incredible simply made burritos, this is nowhere near that list). Decent salsa's. Horchata was as expected.</text>

i love this chain. however this location is absolutely disgusting.  their food tatses like it had been sitting  there almost premade. we almost always have the wrong order given to us. the staff acts like they cannot be bothered with you and ive even gotten an eye roll  on a few occasions.  the night time staff especially are the worst  offenders.  my bf and i will make the drive to rancho to get better food at that location.  its worth it trust me.< /text>

<Text>Best Mexican food North of San Diego. Mandatory stop when travelling to and from Tahoe. Carne Asada burrito made the way it should be. Meat, Guac, pico, and most importantly NO beans and rice!

I also have to have 3 rolled tacos and guacamole, something that cant be found anywhere in norcal.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>
