<Text>I have used Randy's a few times now and each time was a pleasant. Highly professional with good rates. You could tell he was fast but took his time  to be carful with my truck with the hook up and delivery. Driving to my destination the driver was cheerful and remembered me from the last time I needed his service. I will always use Randy's you should too :)< /Text>< pics>

Randy was super friendly and got to our vehicle in under 20 minutes. His price for service was a great deal for the service he provided to us. We will be recommending him to others and saving his number for any of our needs in the Yuba City area.< /text>

Randy immediately called us back, provided very helpful information, advised us on the most economical option. Honestly a good guy, good character, integrity for his business and care for his customers. Thank you!<//Review>< Pictures>

This company is very good to their customers! They always answer promptly and are polite when helping you. Their wait times are never too long and I've yet to find a distance they won't travel for a customer! They give A+ service with their A+ people. I've called and used Randy's towing about 5 times now, and I have yet to wait over 20 mins and have yet to be told no, even when I was an hour away!! I would highly recommend!</Text>

I can't remember who I talked to but... Let me tell you I was very thankful. Being a lady that had too much to drink and a blind date gone bad he wanted me to move my car. I was not going to do that so I called Randy's Towing. The gentleman on the phone was happy to talk to me for a few min and was very kind. Thank you Randy's Towing employee.<//text>

Randy's Towing is incredible. I've called twice in the last month and they were immensely helpful, patient, and taught me how to accurately load and unload a car on a tow dolly... at 5 AM.
True gems.</Text>

Randy's towing is honest, dependable and very professional.  Every time we have had to call on randy's towing we received excellent, professional service.  When our granddaughter's car was sideswiped, Randy's towing came quickly and we had the comfort of knowing her car was in good hands.  They are definitely a 5 star company.< /Review>

< Review>
I locked my keys in my car. I contacted my insurance company. They assigned a towing company, Magic Towing. Their estimated arrival time was going to be over an hour. The weather is about 40 degrees F. I was expecting to be locked out of my car so I was underdressed. When I called Magic Company and asked if they can come sooner, they declined, indicating it will take them another 40 mins.  I finally called Randy's Towing. Randy showed up promptly!! He was fast and professional. He also accepted my insurance car. If I get into this sitaution again or if one needs a referral, I HIGHLY recommend Randy's Towing. Do not use Magic Towing, unless you want to wait around for over an hour! Thank you Randy. I was able to get home,  finish my errand  and now I can enjoy the rest of my day and weekend! You were a blessing!</Review>

< Review>
So happy, that with all the choices, I was lucky enough to choose the best!  I expected to wait for at least twenty minutes longer than it took for the truck to get there. Randy, the owner, rescued me after I hit a giant pothole which took out two of my tires. He drove me over a half hour for an honest price and we actually had a great conversation on the way.  I would look nowhere else for a tow again.</Review>

Been a long day, so I'll just Bottom Line it. Need a tow job? Want it done correctly?
Then, don't waste your time calling anyone else. Called my ins. co. this a.m., I needed a flatbed truck to HAUL my van OVER to "safer side" of Sacramento river. Not THROUGH the river like first tow guy wanted to do. If I had wanted to get my van wet... what did I need him for? Duh!
Randy was quick and professional, I'm so grateful. Told USAA  of today's experience with both tow services. Expect Randy will rise to top of their call list. He's already there on mine. Thanks again!< /review>

Great driver.  After dealing with a car issue that left me stranded in Sac and in a foul mood.  Randy's towing picked me up.  The driver was so nice and easy to talk to.  Made the stressful situation so much better.  Thank you!!< /Review>

<GmapID>0x8084ab8ed4a25e87:0xefa9bb4d4d7e3b81<//GmapID><review>I am a local independent insurance agent for Oakview Insurance Services.

One of our client's teenage daughter had a flat tire and was stuck on the side of the road on Hwy 99 down towards Natomas and called us unsure of what to do.

Because of her location  we called all over Sacramento & Rio Linda to find help for her. The wait times I was being quoted were 4 hours or more and I wasn't comfortable letting a young teenage girl sit for hours on the side of the road.

I called Randy's Towing and Randy answered immediately and came to the rescue. He started driving while I was still explaining the situation to get there as quickly as he could.

Less than an hour later he called to let us know that our client's daughter was back on the road and that everything was taken care of.

Randy provided absolutely stellar service and I couldn't be more impressed with his professionalism and responsiveness.

He will be our first call in the future.<//review><date>1555710752083<//date></record></dataset><record>

Super nice and very honest. They are very reasonable and up front on pricing . When I called they let me know up front it would take about thirty minutes to get to me and to my surprise they actually were there when they said which was a shock compared to my past experiences with tow companies . Can say enough about what a great experience in a stressful situation.</Review>

I found Old Harbor Insurance on a fluke...I was in a last minute pinch to find new short term rental insurance for our vineyard estate in Temecula when Carlo & Crystal came to my rescue.  They quickly went to work to find me a new company.  Carlo created this very cool and informative video explaining to me my options and after the video spent even more time on the phone with me answering my many questions and helping me to pick the best coverage option for our property and at a substantial savings over my previous policy. Crystal took care of tying up the loose ends and made sure I had my new policy in place right on time with no lapse in coverage.  They made my last minute stressful situation actually pleasant and enjoyable.

I loved working with Old Harbor so much that I just finished switching over all of our personal insurance accounts as well.  Two cars, homeowners, earthquake and an umbrella policy to boot. When all was said and done,  Crystal was able to save me about $1300 from our previous insurance carrier!  She was amazing, making the switch once again seamless and easy.  I am so happy to of found Old Harbor.  They have taken such good care of all our insurance needs, saved me money and made it so I will never look any farther.  Thanks Carlo & Crystal!!</text>

I currently have Old Harbor for my home insurance. When I called and spoke to Crystal (she’s amazing!) in regards to auto insurance she went out of her way to shop around for me. She found me the BEST RATE not only for auto but decreased my home insurance price. She was so quick to respond to my emails and answer ALL my questions. I definitely recommend Old Harbor for home and auto insurance!!<//Review>

<review>I've been with Old Harbor Insurance for a few years now and they have been consistently awesome!  They got me a great rate on my homeowners insurance, which is why I moved over from State Farm, then shortly after I moved over our cars, and today Angela went above and beyond in getting us a great rate on motorcycle coverage too!  They are 5 Star Rock Stars!  Thank you Old Harbor Team!  It's always a pleasure dealing with you!  The Fulton's< /review>< userid>

<Review>Crystal and the rest of the team at Old Harbor are fantastic. Great rates as they just beat my AAA policy and got me to switch after 15 or so years with AAA for auto. Looking forward to continuing to work with them and thank you again Crystal for being so responsive and  timely for all of our requests.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80db7e2ee7a93f13:0xcaee0ee1ff742701</gmap_id><pictures>None< /pictures>< rating>

Without any accidents or tickets on our record, Wawanesa increased our rates yet again so I picked up the phone and called Crystal at Old Harbor. Crystal immediately provided us a quote over the phone saving us over $200.00 a year with better coverage! Crystal was very professional, fast, and efficient!</review>

Angela helped me when my coverage was 1day beyond grace period. I explained her that I made mistake by thinking that already payed the company but it was company with the similar name "Old ...". Angela contacted insurance company and helped to reinstate without a lapse. I would advise to work with Angela as she cares about clients more than about her own comfort.</Text>

My experience with Old Harbor Insurance has been nothing short of spectacular. From day one I have been treated as if I were the only client they have. The responses to my questions and the ability to handle any changes to my insurance upon my behalf is seeming effortless.

In contrast I actually attempted a policy alteration through Nationwide and it was mind numbingly slow and difficult. I am will be forever grateful to Brian Decker who recommended Carlo Diaz and his extremely qualified. I most recently dealt with Angela by phone, my call literally lasted less than five minutes, and I left the conversation knowing that everything would be taken care of promptly and it was.

Thank you all for your high degree of professionalism and customer service.< /Text>

I love this office by far the best service I have ever experienced. Not only are they competitive with their quotes but they are professional and detailed oriented. I recently refinanced my home and they were able to spot the escrow company's mistake and took their time to call them to get it corrected. Thank you ! You guys are amazing.</Review>

Christian at Old Harbor is very professional, friendly, and has always promptly responded the all our phone calls and emails. He's honest, and recently directed my husband and I to another insurance brokerage, since he was unable to provide a competitive price. We've used him for several home owner's insurance policies and several auto insurance policies. I would highly recommend Old Harbor.< /Text>

<Review>I work with Chris Andrews. I made the mistake of not going with him a few years ago when we were shopping insurance companies. We recently made the switch to him and he's saved us over $700/year. He's very personable and lays out details in terms I can easily understand. He's straight forward and offers top-notch customer service. Always available with a quick turnaround which is hard to find these days. Fully satisfied!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
If there were more stars I'd give them!! What a positive experience.  It made home insurance shopping painless.  Carlo's attention to customer service is the best I've experienced in the Insurance industry.  He listened to my needs, studied my former policy and then went to work researching a better product.  Long story short, better coverage and better price, you can't beat that!!  He always made himself available with quick responses to my calls, or emails. His professionalism is to be commended.  I would recommend Harbor Insurance HIGHLY.  TEN stars for Carlo and his  team!!!< /Review>

They are readily available to any questions or needs I may have and their prices are always competitive.  They treat you with professionalism and respect.  If its something I need insurance on and they provide it, they will be writing it.

Great company--you can't go wrong using them.<//Review>< Resp>

<Review>I have been working with Christian Richter and his team for 8 years.  They are very supportive and always there to help.  I can call Christian for support and he answers his cell!  I once got stuck in Chico, on a weekend, and called Christian for help with accident questions and he was there for me...and followed up to see how everything went.  The team also shops insurance for me to ensure I have the best coverage at the best rate.  I never have to worry or think of anything related to my car.  I highly recommend working with Old Harbor Insurance.</Review></record>

On top of that, Old Harbor makes the insurance process PERSONAL and ENJOYABLE. 5 stars!!!</Review>

The Old Harbor Insurance team is truly a pleasure to work with. They are attentive, detailed, organized, and experienced. They are my go-to insurance company for all of my needs and are also my insurance consultants when it comes to things like business and specialty insurance. I give them my highest of recommendations and am glad I found someone to handle my insurance for life.<//review>

Chris Andrews helped us switch our insurance over quickly and easily after we had some unexpected premium increases with our previous carrier. He was able to match the coverage on all of our policies and get us much more fair prices and we are really happy with his service so far.</Review>

<Time>1544078021165<//Time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>When purchasing my home, I inquired whether my realtor, Mitch Matthews, could recommend a company for my Homeowner’s Insurance needs. Without any hesitation, Mitch referred me to Carlo Diaz, from Old Harbor Insurance. Mitch indicated that Carlo takes care of his personal insurance needs and indicated that I would find no one better. Since Mitch recommended Carlo without any reservation, I gave him a call. That was one of the wisest calls I have made.

Carlo was amiable, courteous, genuine, and good-natured. Those were my first impressions of the gentleman. I felt optimistic that Mitch had steered me in the right direction. I gave him an outline of my needs and he went to work for me.

I was pleasantly surprised when shortly thereafter, I received a return call from Carlo.  It was evident that Carlo is extremely hardworking, detail-oriented, and thorough. Being a broker, Carlo can search numerous insurance providers to pin-point the best company for my needs. Carlo delivered clear explanations, was patient when I had questions, was considerate of my needs, and respectful of the fact that I am retired and on a fixed-income.

Additionally, since I was completely impressed by Carlo and Old Harbor Insurance, I contacted him again to receive auto insurance quotes for our vehicles which were due for renewal. Yet again, Carlo surpassed all expectations. His rate will save me $1,000 over my current company’s price! Furthermore, by bundling home and auto insurance with the same company, he was able to offer rates that will also save me money.

While Carlo is a broker, he and Old Harbor Insurance will receive my business for my total insurance coverage requirements.</text>< pics>

<text>Christian took incredible care of me throughout the whole process,  gave me an incredible rate, and when I was at-fault in a fender bender, I was extremely impressed with the care the insurance provider he referred me to gave me. Christian even checked in during the process of filing my claim to make sure everything was going smoothly. Working with Christian has been a pleasure.< /text>< pics>

Carlo and Old Harbor Insurance are the absolute best. They are quick to respond to any and every request I have...and I have some crazy requests. It could be in regards to the business, personal insurance, help with claims, or just general questions, Carlo and his team deliver every single time!<//review>

< Review>
We were referred to Christian Richter and Old Harbor Insurance through our sister Debbie LeTourneau from Willow Street Property Management. Debbie spoke highly of not only Christian's professionalism, but also his very personal approach to the insurance business  It's too bad the slogan "you're in good hands" has already been used.  We have not been disappointed and would confidently refer him to anyone we know.<//Review>

We've known Carlo Diaz for 10 years and couldn't think of someone we trust more with our insurance needs than him and his team. Old Harbor goes above and beyond to make sure you always have the best rates, best coverage and they have your best interest at hand. Absolutely recommend them!< /review>

I have been using Christian and and the team over at old harbor for over 3 years now. My relationship first began with them through a work account. They did such an amazing job they now not only insure all my personal stuff, but they now insure my entire family. I can not say enough good things about these guys. If you are looking for anyone to handle your insurance needs pick up the phone and call these guys! You will not be disappointed I can guarantee that!< /Review>

<Review>Very high spirited workers! Wonderful place to go buy almost everything, the best convenience store out there. As a regular customer I recommend everyone to go visit the store. “It's the happiest place on earth” - as a worker there once said.

HL is one of two liquor stores in my neighborhood.

They genuinely engage with you and will listen to any requests on new products. I asked for pliny the elder and within a week they had it in the cooler.

But his Front-desk staff is absolutely the WORST EVER!  Attitude of staff behind the front desk are rude to the patients (made me think that’s the way they treat the elderly, since most of the patients are seniors.) The waiting time for appointment has always been excessive, I’ve been with Dr. Mosier for 10 years or more and every time I’d to wait over 1 to 2 hours beyond the appointment time.  The Office Manager, when confronted, actually told me to go to another eye doctor!! Is Dr too busy that she is turning clients away!  Need to overhaul the entire Front Office!!!< /Text>< response>

<text>Do not go to this office. Find one that cares about their patients. My son is getting married in 5 days and unfortunately I get an eye infection inside and outside of my eye. I called to get an appointment to see the doctor and was told go see your primary. I told them i didn't have one and this was an emergency i needed help now with my eye. And was told again to go see another dr. Last time i will ever go there.<//text><Resp>None</Resp></record>

The staff are caring, patient, and attentive. Last visit was with a Dr I was not familiar with, however, he took great care of me and answered all of my questions.
This is truly the place for all of your eye care needs. I drive over 80 miles to come here, so take that for what it’s worth!<//text>

<Review>Just a few days out of Surgery. Dr. Mosier is a whizzbang eye surgeon. Explained the entire surgery to me at Pre-Op.  I can not even remember when I have ever received the kind of pre-surgery support I got from his hand picked crew. I am not kidding, it was like going to a five star hotel. Everybody was checking on me and offering support. I waited for that evil needle stick in my hand. Did not feel anything. How did they do that? When I said I was a little cold, they brought me in a preheated blanket.  Can't say enough. Walker Force< /Review>< user_name>

<Text>From the minute I walk into Dr. Mosier's office, I feel well taken care of.
The last time, they took every precaution with the "Covid-19" to follow
all the health guide lines. I felt VERY safe being there. Also, the
personnel are friendly and helpful. Dr. Mosier is the BEST!!  I highly
recommend him for your eye care. You will be in good hands.< /Text>< pictures>

Had cataracts removed from both eyes in last 4 months and seeing without corrective lenses for first time in over 60 years.

Dr. Mosier is a life-savor as far as I am concerned.  The ophthalmologist my physician had called to help with my iritis was not available.  So he called his on-call ophthalmologist--Dr. Mosier.  Since my condition needed daily attention and it was Memorial Day weekend, Dr. Mosier met with me each weekend day.  In the process, he was able to diagnose the cause of the iritis as a disease which had been misdiagnosed my entire adult life [I was nearing my 50th birthday].  Since then, I have seen Dr. Mosier for all of my eye needs, including removable of cataracts in both eyes.  His greatest skill is his ability to remain calm and reassuring, regardless of what my fears were.  His demeanor is so calming and reassuring.  He is also my wife's doctor.  Her eye pressure, in both eyes, is always a concern.  Still, Dr. Mosier's skill and know;ledge has been most reassuring.  My Rheumatologist is retiring in December.  I hope Dr. Mosier goes on forever!  He is the best!!</text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Text>So I just came back from my first appointment there. First, I want to say that I have NEVER written a review for anything or had such a bad experience where I felt so frustrated at the way I was treated I had to write a review.
I called to make a last minute appointment Friday and was told I couldn’t get one without giving my insurance information so they can check benefits before I get there. It wasn’t until after I had already seen the doctor and was back at the front desk to pay my co-pay that they told me I was inactive and that it was $275 for the visit. I was surprised because I had called to make sure I was active before making the appointment which I tried to explain but she quickly dismissed me and said “well it’s inactive now so it’s $275”. And when I tried asking why they didn’t tell me I was inactive before I saw the doctor to let me know I would have to pay out of pocket the lady just turned to the girl next to her and said, “I can’t hear anything” and just ignore me. They kept telling me it was policy to pay on visit which I understand but they should’ve told me before letting me see the doctor. I would’ve come back another day when the problem was fixed. I felt pressured and like they were trying to intimidate me to pay because it was their mistake for not checking or letting me know it was showing inactive when I told them I had insurance. I ended up just paying and leaving because I don’t like to argue with people that simply don’t care to fix a problem. She just wanted me to pay and get out and I was so frustrated I didn’t want to talk to that lady with the glasses anymore. I think she’s the manager, at least she acted like it. I had been looking for an ophthalmologist to take my family to but I don’t think this is the right one. I did like the doctor he was very nice it’s just the ladies in the front desk I didn’t think were very helpful at all and just rude. They didn’t try to help me or bother to explain anything. They didn’t even give me the appointment I needed to come back, after they charged my card they basically ignored me again. AND I actually told the lady I only had my Credit card on me and I didn’t know if it would cover the $275 I didn’t know I would be paying today. So she suggested partial payment and I said ok and then she went ahead and charged the whole $275 right away which surprisingly went through. I did not raise my voice or was even remotely rude to any of them. I felt bullied and just left. The only thing I could do is keep myself from saying thank you like I usually would before leaving. I then contacted my insurance and they gave me a new subscriber number to give to them that showed I was active. I called and was refunded but not once did they apologize when I said it was their mistake and that the lady in the front was very rude. The lady on the phone just said ok I’ll let her know. I DO NOT recommend this place based on the front desk staff. Insurances can be complicated and confusing so it’s important to have friendly staff that will take the time to help you fix the problem or just understand it better.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

I am very happy with my experiences of Dr Zore and his staff. I receive thorough examinations and he found Glaucoma in both eyes that had been missed in previous exams. He did not rely only on the 'air puff' test; he looked inside the eye and saw the disease.
He also performed the surgeries on the Cataracts in my eyes and I am so happy to be able to see so many things again.
Dr Zore is personable and pleasant while listening to my concerns about my eyes. He explains the situation to me and this helps me stay calm before going into the surgeries. Thank You for having a patient and understanding staff.</text>

Mosier Eye Center has been taking care of me for years.  I'm diabetic so need a yearly eye exam.  In 2017 I had cataracts removed from both eyes by Dr. Kim.  My experience was a great one and surprise!...I no longer wear glasses except for reading.  What a wonder since I've been wearing glasses since elementary school and am now in my 70's.  Trust Mosier...they're good people!< /text>

<text>Very happy with Mosier Eye Center.  My first visit was last summer.  Great friendly people who know their stuff.  Dr. Mosier in particular encouraged me that my long-existing macular pucker could be remedied and he went over the pictures and details with me so that I understood everything.  He then referred me to a retina specialist and they were great, so now after surgery my eyesight is greatly improved.  I saw Dr. Mosier a couple of days ago and he showed me the after-pictures, presenting the different layers of the maccula, telling me about how they work, validating why my eyesight in that eye will continue to improve.  I couldn't be happier.</text><date>1566420823283</date><Pictures>None</Pictures><Name>Harry Stinnett, Jr.<//Name>< Resp>

Mosier Eye Center people are friendly, knowledgeable, helpful, personable and professional. Dr. Mosier and Dr. Zore are phenomenal Doctors. VERY professional!!!! I had a cataract develop after a pulled rentina and they took VERY good care of me. The office is clean and neat. The people at the front desk are gracious. And the experience was perhaps the best medical experience I've ever had. Recently my wife developed a cataract, and, without going into her medical issues which are challenging, they have done magic for her too. Again, with the same care and compassion they have with me. A friend of mine recommended Mosier Eye Center and I thank him all the time. If you have eye issues check them out. Definitely the place to be.< /Text>

<text>The Mosier Eye Center is great!  The staff are super efficient and nice.  The office is always clean and has plenty of seating.  Considering the detail and complexity of the exam process, the wait time is not excessive and the center provides an area where you can sit and watch interesting programs while your eyes dilate between vision tests and the structural exam by Dr. Mosier.  Dr. Mosier himself is very thorough and has helped me personally by catching my glaucoma quickly and starting the treatment.  He has also helped other of my family members and friends to keep their vision.  I highly recommend this practice.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

I've been going to Mosier Eye Center for several years.  Wouldn't go anywhere else.  Everyone is pleasant.  Always concerned about their patience's comfort.  Our eyes is one of the most precious possessions we have.  You can depend on Mosier Eye Center to  protect our eyes.

I have been seeing ophthalmologists regularly for the past 25 years and I can say Dr. Kim is the best. Balancing compassion with professionalism, he has taken as much time as needed to see to my ophthalmic needs and explain things to me. He did a flawless cataract surgery on my eye for which I am forever grateful. The Mosier staff are likewise very professional and friendly.< /review>

<review>Was late because of a major accident on 57 freeway, appointment was 1pm. Started calling at 12:45 and phone went to voicemail stating they were closed till 1:30 then the voicemail system hung up. Tried three times same thing. Got there at 1:20 and was told that I was too late and they could not fit me in. Asked about the phone message stating that they were closed till 1:30 and it was 1:20, they said they were closed and it was not there fault that I could not get through. They went on to say they were not responsible for their phone system and it was all on me. This day on the 57 at the 91 a semi towing a large earth moving equipment nailed the center. It’s now 5 hours later and it’s still there. They did not care. They offered an appointment in about 4 weeks. Never going back<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>Mosier Eye Center and Dr. Mosier has been my Ophthalmologist for the past 10 plus years and has consistently offered stellar service during each and every visit. I had him perform cataract surgery on both eyes and the procedure was flawless. The staff that supports Dr. Mosier is excellent and treats patients with dignity and quick reliable service. The knowledge within the Mosier Eye Center is second to none and would be hard pressed to find an equal.< /text>< pics>

Mosier Eye Center is 100% people friendly.
The physicians are friendly, professional, explaining what they are doing during the eye exam and stating the results of their diagnosis to you, on the spot before dismissing you, right then and there, which is marvelous, for you do not leave the office wondering what the medical results are.
You feel extremely welcome at the Mosier Eye Center, all the employees & physicians smile and say "Hello", you know  you are welcomed, with their happy smiling attitudes you know each employee loves their job ergo they treat the patients with kindness, this I love ! ! !
It is a joyous pleasure to go to Mosier Eye Center....BECAUSE THEY WELCOME YOU & THAT IS A GOOD THING ! !</Text>

All the employees at Mosier Eye Center are very nice.  They treat you like they are your friends.  I was really surprised to get a call from Dr. Zore himself the day of my eye surgery to ask how I was doing and if I had any questions.  Mosier Eye Center is wonderful.< /Review>

A professional experience on every level but be prepared to invest a couple of hours of your time.  Dr Mosier NEVER rushes you so have your questions ready to go-preferably written.

<Text>WARNING.. This clinic deletes all the bad reviews on Yelp (you can do that for most negative comments by reporting it etc. but I've heard it's not hard to do) and I'm assuming here on Google Reviews too, so that is how this clinic currently has a high rating. I know because I posted a review on Yelp for this clinic for ethical misconduct and I now came upon its page to find that they have < 10 reviews and 4 stars when they used to have over 50 reviews and 2.5 Stars I clearly remember on Yelp.. Instead of just deleting them, why don't they respond on the platforms to those comments and take responsibility for their wrongdoings.. This clinic makes me lose faith in humanity<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Doctors would just say "It will go away" or gave me drops.  it came and went for so long I gave up hope. It returned again, this time much more obvious so my doctor sent me to Mosier eye clinic where I seen Dr Zore.  He asked me a few questions assessed me for maybe 5-10 minutes and told me He suspected a very rare autoimmune disorder.  I was sent to another specialist and blood work was done.  sure enough Dr Zore was correct.  It took him 5 minutes of just listening to realize what I had where several other doctors could not figure out in over 9 years.  I am now on medication and have not had a issue yet.  The staff was also great, friendly and VERY FAST. I think I waited 5 minutes tops.

The staff was friendly and professional at all times.  Dr. Mosier was open to questions and he conveyed a feeling of just how important the success of my procedures were to him.  Thanks to the whole team!</review>

Dr. Mosier is a truly expert ophthalmologist, as a surgeon, a technician and doctor with a rare and caring bedside manner.  There are rarely undue waits in the office: the staff is efficient and friendly; the optometrists in the lobby are also outstanding.  I have not had difficult eye problems, but I have known some of the patients who did have challenging difficulties and the treatment has been excellent.<//review>

The five star top quality service at Mosier Eye Center has expanded to deal with the added COVID-related checks. I have been in for appointments since COVID hit in March. Dr. Mosier had performed cataract surgery in February, and I was having check ups and adjusting the strength of my new lenses. The quality of service was top notch. I am over the moon about the results from my cataract surgery. I have not seen this well without glasses since high school. You cannot get better eye care anywhere.</review>

We too were previously patients of Dr. Kitchen and Dr. Law, but are totally happy with the staff here.  Although we have not seen Dr. Mosier, Jamie Hancock has taken good care of us for the past couple of years.  We return annually with confidence.  And Lynn Narita is a true professional when it comes to our glasses.  We can enthusiastically recommend Mosier Eye Center without reservations.< /Text>

Dr. Mosier and Dr. Hancock have been my eye care providers for at least fifteen years. They have provided exceptional care and are very knowledgeable. Dr. Hancock is an expert with contacts. I have found all the personnel are very polite and effeciant. If you are looking for topnotch eye care Mosier Eye Center is the place to go.</review>

I was treated exceptionally well, from the front office to the very last step in my eye exam process. The ophthalmologist, Dr. Zore, took the time to learn about my history and those things which effect my vision. I have never had a Dr. take this much time and be so thorough - I felt like a person, not a number! I can't recommend this eye center highly enough.< /Text>

I love Dr. Mosier, been going to him for awhile, unfortunately I didn't care for his office staff, had problems with billing due to changing their software program.  I since have moved to sr. facility gated community in Riverside & had to get an eye Dr. out here & I am now dealing with glaucoma.  Fullerton used to be a wonderful place to live & raise a family, my kids going to Sunny Hills etc. with Dr. Mosiers, etc. my kids & grandkids went to same school as their parents but Fullerton has changed.  Another complaint I had was the wait time at Dr. Mosiers office..< /text>

<text>I have been going to Dr. Mosier for over twenty years.  I have never had a bad experience, in fact, not only treating my eyes including surgery, he has demonstrated patience and a professional touch.  His staff is equally professional  I recommend him without qualification.

Its been a year since my last review.  As usual an exceptional visit along with Dr. Hancocks change in my rx.  Dr. Moser is the best and I have   recommend others to his office.<//text>< Gmap_id>

He recently made an emergent appt due to a severe eye infection. Dr Kim told my 82 yr old pre-glaucoma father that a "cold had settled in his eyes" and sent him home with over the counter Refresh eye drops. Thankfully he came to visit me, so alarmed by the amount of discharge, swelling, red eye and obvious pressure, our trip to urgent care gave him a correct diagnosis of bacterial conjunctivitis and prescription antibiotic drops and additional care advice. Also followed up with another ophthalmologist. Both Dr's were alarmed by the severity of his infection and very disturbed by his initial treatment by Dr Kim. I am very upset and unsatisfied by his diagnosis and care of my father. Unacceptable!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Text>My experience at the Eye Center was fine but unfortunately I have been unable to follow up on my referral to Dr. Goldberger. The first time I called they said the referral hadn't come through yet and by the time I received the acceptance from St. Jude I have been unable to make contact with their office. Every time I call I have to leave a message and as of yet no one has returned my calls. This is very disappointing.

<Pictures>None</Pictures><review>The Mosier Eye Center is an extremely efficient operation.  The staff is well experienced and very professional.  The Doctors are dedicated to your eye health and give very thorough examinations.  In my case, they found that I have Macular Degeneration which was not diagnosed by my previous eye doctor.  I was given a full explanation of the prognosis and
recommended treatment.

I previously was a patient of Dr. Kitchen, who is now retirned, and Dr. Law, who has a full-time location out of the area.  They were my eye doctors for over 30 years and were wonderful.  I look forward to the same with Dr. Yu.  She was thorough in checking my vision and was ably assisted by supporting staff throughout the examination process.</text>< Pics>

Really disrespecfull I had shoes to return but they did not want to and when had no choice and no good reason for not returning they told me not to come shop in the store again...i did not know workers in the store could stop you from shopping in the store for returning items that you are not satisfied with it..<//review>

Manager is a jerk.  Would not accept a return (or exchange) because tags were removed.  Shirt does not fit right, brought tags with me along with receipt.  I will not go back to this store.<//Review>

<review>Great layout for drinks/and shows. General admission you have to stand. If it's a show you're not all that into it's a good situation for going back and forth from show area and bar. I can't stand that long so I thought seated tickets were worth it. If you're a smoker, they have a smoker's area so you don't have to leave the venue, and you can bring your drink! Parking is limited and expensive. I'd definitely go again and would recommend it.<//review></record>

My old band, Lipstick Conspiracy played there years ago!
It's a smaller, more intimate club. Where you can get up close to your favorite bands/performers. Awesome stage setup where bands can get on and off stage super fast!
Chill bartenders, happy to chat while hooking you up.
I was sad to hear rumours that they were closing, but it looks that may not be true?
If you get a chance to see a favorite of yours there, by all means check it out!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808f80ad8aeb595b:0x2943c13c72ac397c< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Great events, sometimes. Pick your flavor and they have it at some time of the month. Like periods, but opposite.</text>

Stand up comedy on Wednesdays around 7:30. They were funny and it was free plus there is booze. What's not to like?< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><review>Nice people. They are good at sales, although not too knowledgable about products. I came in with my mod in hand and was upsold to a very expensive piece of junk. The manager claimed that the Aegis X was basically indestructible, and would last me a lifetime. I took a small 2 ft spill on the tile one week later, the glass on my tank didn't break, but the mod did. All I got was an offer for 25% off a new mod. No thanks, I'll spend my money elsewhere. It's cool that they make their own juice and all, but the juice is pretty much trash. I'd go somewhere else. GeekVape support is also incompetent.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80c365d908d930f7:0x86e917618544ca98<//Gmap_id></record>

Talk to Justin if he is there. Very knowledgeable and will break it down for you if your a beginner like myself. Great experience, I'm glad I went here first. Got me an Aegis rig, and Justin had the patience to go over everything with me. I'm officially vaping. Smoking cigarettes since 1995. Wish me luck and will!</text>

She was tried to stay friendly as possible but I could tell she was getting alittle flustered dealing with me and other customers coming in and answering the phone at the same time. But other than that she tried to explain things as best she could. I would return to this establishment again.<//review>< rate>

The juice they sell is the best I've ever tried. But they sold me an Imren battery (Never heard of it) I had to take it back to get replaced and the replacement is just as bad as the first one. They claim it's a good battery but it dies before it's even halfway discharged.<//Review>

I'm a new time beginner to vape I in I went in and the ladies had name was Amanda and let me tell you that lady was not only polite sweet kind hearted and very knowledgeable but was extremely helpful and I couldn't have asked for a better teacher to begin a vape I an experience you ever have any questions or want to begin the adventure that we all take I adeptly recommend not only just going to the store but asking for Amanda she is the greatest person you could ever start something with and not worry about being misled just get a sail out of you or to buy something you don't need these people were there to be helpful and courteous and they went beyond and above to do that<//text>

Staff is not knowledgable on the products they're pretending to be professionals in. They offer subpar batteries at a higher price than premium batteries, and then delete friendly comments pointing these things out.

Buyer beware; any battery you buy here will be extremely over rated and will have a high chance of harming you and your device. Always look at moocs guide for the proper batteries to invest money into.<//Text>

Been there 3 times, twice for juice and once because I thought I broke my mod.  They hooked it up with a new coil and gave me the run down in 5 minutes with nothing but honesty and respect even though I'm new to vaping.  Love this spot.</Text>

<Text>love this place. This has become my new favorite vape shop...everyone is very welcoming. I have visited 3 times now in the past 2 months, and everytime i am recognized and greeted great people.

<Text>Brenda earned each and every star...she was wonderful!! Super friendly, fast and very professional. I felt at ease and completely comfortable right upon meeting her. I am what they call a "hard stick". My veins are small/thin and I have always had trouble with needles and blood withdrawals. Due to past issues I'm traumatized and go into panic mode and my anxiety goes through the roof. I couldn't be more thankful for having Brenda withdraw my blood. I honestly could say I did not feel a thing from start to finish. If ever I need my blood drawn again I hope to be able to get Brenda back. Thank you again Brenda you are the very best at what you do...it was a pleasure meeting you!!!< /Text>< pics>

<Review>Kirsten was the name of the nurse and she really went above and beyond the call of duty. Super caring and loving. She stayed longer than we booked her just to make sure everything was going to be okay when she left. I am super grateful for the attention and care that was given. The follow up call was the final touch of such great service. It was an extraordinary customer experience. I am super happy that I found them especially if it is needed in the future. I highly recommend the mobile drip therapy in a heartbeat. Five star service with a smile. Thank you so much!!! 💖<//Review><Resp>{'time': 1617493389716, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind review.

This was fast easy convenient.  We live in AZ, and it’s pretty difficult to get rapid Covid testing same day. Appointments have been 3 days out and lines are long at testing site. I have two aging parent who cannot wait all day just to get tested.  We were exposed by our home health aid, and Christmas is right around the corner. If we couldn’t get proof negative they would have missed out on their grand babies. I booked the appointment in the morning, the scheduling person called me back and booked me for same afternoon. Our tech   C. Romo was professional, proficient, patient, and polite. She was on and out. We received are results via phone a few hour later. It was a good experience, and peace of mind was worth the price. Spending Christmas with my nephews... priceless.< /text>

First I want to start by thanking Annabel for taking my call at 9 pm. I was really dehydrated and needed someone to come asap, which they did. I love a business that takes pride and has work ethic. Nurse Alison came to my rescue, boy was she great! Love the whole experience and will keep using them. Thank you guys so much. I highly recommend this company.<//review>

<text>I enjoyed my visit by Susana. She was professional and made me feel very comfortable while she started my IV. (Didn’t feel a thing). The hour went by so fast since we had a very nice conversation. My daughter (she’s 24) was sitting with me and also said what a nice experience and she can’t wait to have her own visit. I felt great after. I slept like rock that night, best sleep I’ve had in weeks!! I recommend this company it was a very easy appointment to set up. From Steven the person that called me to set up appt the doc was very thorough and especially RN Susan. She was amazing! Thank you Drip Hydration!!<//text></record>

This company is AMAZING!!!  After falling through the cracks with the VA, an emergent need of hydration was needed prior to next round of Chemo. Came out next day!  (They do have same day service). They saved they day AND patient is MUCH more alert and willing to drink and eat. I will be a walking billboard for Drip Hydration. Send me shirts, flyers or whatever. I am telling everyone about their services. Thank you SO Much ❤️</text>

Drip Hydration sent a technician named Salma for my blood draw. She had a kind and professional demeanor. I am a difficult draw, but she demonstrated patience and a knowledge base, which put me at ease. I received calls and texts confirming not only that week's appointment, but 30 minutes early on the day of and when Salma arrived on-time. Overall, it was an excellent experience.</Review>

This Dental facility is unique. The employees work in a family atmosphere and therefore when you walk in you feel welcomed to this family of professionals. I am 80 years old and have horse teeth but I always feel like smiling when I leave. They are an amazing group of women and men who work hard to get you in and out in a timely manner. Their service to tooth care is the best. If you are struggling with proper dental care you must come here. You will wonder why you didn't take the time to check them out.</Text>

Shannon not only raises goats, she IS the GOAT (Greatest Of All Time)! Shannon is absolutely outstanding and has been providing that excellent standard of care for years. Shannon honors her “mentor”, Stella Norris (another dental hygienist GOAT), through her reliable, steady, first-class professional performance. Dr. Stella Dariotis is also FANTASTIC! My family have been patients of this practice since 1984 and appreciate these two professionals. They ROCK!< /Text>

The best care I’ve ever received. Everyone who works in this practice takes extra time to inform me about my treatment and also how to take better care at home. I always thought I was knowledgeable, but I’ve learned much and added new habits which have made a big difference in my dental health.< /Review>

I have going to Dr Di Tomasso’s dental practice for years. They are always very friendly and professional. They have top of the line staff and equipment.  I was told today that my teeth looked great.  All I could think was it was because of all of the advice and guidance I received from them over the years.</text>

<review>I chipped my front tooth during a busy time in my own profession and I was immediately scheduled and the tooth was repaired in less than 24 hours. Their swift response and treatment was excellent and saved me the embarrassment of interacting with people with a jagged front tooth.<//review><user_id>107781497027515753011</user_id><Response>None< /Response><pics>None</pics>< time>

I have been a patient of "Dr. Pam" for more years than either of us would care to admit to :).  I can say though, that through the years the professionalism of Dr. DiTomasso and her entire staff is unequaled in any dental or primary care facility I have ever dealt with.  If you are fortunate enough to have this dental group as an option-take it, you'll be very glad you did.  Thank you again Dr. Pam DiTomasso for so many years of unrivaled exceptional dental care!<//text>

DiTomasso Dental has always been the best dental practice in Sacramento, but during Covid-19 they have morphed into the best dental practice.... anywhere!!! They have so many amazing practices in place to keep everyone safe. The office spared no expense, literally--- they have every single base covered. I walked in feeling nervous and left feeling comforted and secure. I would recommend then to anyone who wants to get the best in dental care!!< /text>

I felt comfortable the minute I walked in and received a warm welcome.  All staff and Dr. Stella explained each procedure and I appreciated that very much.  As I considered finding a dental practice closer to where I now live, I am very thankful that my daughter recommended the dental practice she has depended on for many years.< /Review>

Dr. Pam is the best dentist in Sacramento.  I've been going to this office for dental care for 20+ years.  My recent visit was another example of how great they are.  I was called 30 minutes before my appointment and asked if I wanted to come in early which was great.  The visit was for a cleaning, but after I mentioned concern over one of my teeth, Dr. Pam came over and gave me an exam anyway.  They also took a digital scan of my teeth with a really cool machine to be able to measure and track my gum loss over time.  They really make great use of technology at this office.  The hygienist was Kate and she is also the best.  Besides being so nice, she's very knowledgeable and professional.  She did a great job explaining everything she was doing.</Text>

<text>We are new to DiTomasso Dental.  We are very happy with them.  Their staff and dentists are great.  The office has a very hospitable, friendly atmosphere.  I like that they have good up-to-date technology.  They also emphasize preventative care.  I had a couple of "deep cleanings" that, via the latest checkup, have helped my gums tremendously.  I am also following the care instructions from my hygienist.< /text>< pictures>

I've been a patient off Dr. Pam's for over 30 years. Since then and 2 additional dentists and larger staff later, I still enjoy outstanding customer service and excellent care. Everyone on the staff is professional and friendly and they are always on time; but they also are very technical and stay abreast of advancements in their field. This office makes time for continuous training and it shows.  I'll never go anywhere else - I started here solo and then brought my husband, then my son and have referred countless numbers of people and they are all still patients. Could not recommend them more highly.< /text>

This is a large practice with very caring women, which intimidated me in the beginning. I recently returned to the practice because I needed Invisalign. Dr. DiTomasso made me feel very comfortable and clearly explained the steps of my treatment. I look forward to seeing my progress over the next several months. I have complete faith in her as a dentist and long-standing member of the community. I feel the hygienists to be top-notch and are great at explaining what's happening. They set up a good treatment plan for me moving forward.< /review>

I would like to give my feedback regardiing Shannon the dental hygienist. She is amazing and has made my experience at this dental office very positive. She is gentle, professional and informative. She deserves a huge raise. I will keep coming as long as I can see her. She also has a wonderful personality with a positive attitude and a well developed sense of humor. Thank you Shannon for your wonderful care. Lori Sondheim</text>

A truly phenomenal set of dental professionals.  They make you feel genuinely welcome, comfortable and cared for.  Their communication to the patient and among themselves is EXCELLENT. You are kept totally appraised of EVERY step in your treatment process (before, during and after).  They constantly check with the patient to verify there is no discomfort during treatment.  Their technology is state-of-the-art (3-D views of the areas being treated, comprehensive patient treatment data).  They are focused on your total dental health (treatment, maintenance, avoiding future conditions).

They are a great team of very nice folks, who are really good at what they do!< /text>

<Review>Apologies for typos, spelling and grammar. ESL
Hello, I'll share with you all how my first experience went with this dental office.

First thing first, I had to book far out since they are busy as they are quite popular. I now understand why that is--they're great.

Easily accessible since they had their own parking space in the back.

I was a new client, so these were the following services that I received in order (different work stations). YMMV, your experience may differ depending on what needs to be done.

1) x-rays / screening off my teeth. This is where the lady also asked me general questions, made sure I filled out all the necessary paperwork. Then, asked me more specific questions regarding my health questionnaire that I filled out. She then proceeded to take x-rays of my teeth.

2) dental hygienist: performed gum assessment, general cleaning and finished it with some flossing. Pretty spot on about my mouth and the assessments that she made. I visited another dental office not too long ago prior to this visit.

3) Impression (they take pictures and create a 3-d model of it) - They provided some service that basically stimulated if I had braces / Invisalign and took thorough pictures of my teeth during this station

4) The dentist - Dr. Pam (?) did some explanations of my teeth and why they are the way they are today. She was insightful. Dr. Pam checked up on my teeth thoroughly and made sure I understand the anatomy of it at a high level.

5) Consultation / booking next appointment – Amy was breaking down the payment plan and set up a future appointment.

During each service/work station, the staff made sure that I was always comfortable. They took the time to explain to me, so I understood what they were doing in my mouth. They were also honest and upfront with me about the costs. They also had a screen in each work station that showed the work that was being performed (via a camera attached to the dental tool).

Overall, professional. The technology they have there also drew me in. This dental office has set the bar for all the other dentists that I visited.

This was definitely a big shift from my previous dentist office who seemed lacking in technology. The cool thing too is that they also send out reminders and calender invites.  So, I definitely appreciate all the tech this office is using!</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Dr. Pam and Kristen are truly talented- they take the time to explain everything thoroughly, are extremely gentle and very efficient. It is no wonder that patients come back year after year- they are passionate about what they do and excellent at it, too! They both checked in with me, later in the day, to make sure I was still doing okay after the procedure- 5+ stars!< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Everyone is friendly, considerate and knowledgeable.  They seem interested in you and want to do the best they can for you.  They want you at ease with no discomfort.  I would hope everyone could undergo dental experiences such as given at Di Tomasso Dental.

I was taken in very quickly and received excellent care. I have been a patient of DiTomasso Dental since 1995.  This office consistently exceeds my expectations for providing exceptional care and outstanding advice.  By following their advice I was able to scale back my dental visits from 3 to twice a year.  My teeth and gums are not only healthier and look better, but I am also saving money.< /review>

ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS a good experience here! It's the only place that ease my anxiety of going to a dentist. All the staff are amazing (caring, easy going, & professional). The office is very clean, and parking is free & available in the back. I highly recommend DiTomasso Dental for anyone who is looking for a dentist/dental work.
Going off tangent here: In December 2018, I had my baby and a beautiful floral arrangement was delivered to my house from DiTomasso Dental! THANK YOU DiTomasso Dental for taking care of my smile!< /text>

REALLY like my dental office--all the DDSs and all the staff; thanks.
She has been my dentist for most of my life and I've always been happy with her and her care. This last time I got in with less than 24 hour notice to fix a bridge issue--thanks so much.</Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Wow! Every staff member was 100% professional, courteous, and friendly. Tour of the office  was a wonderful touch I didn’t expect to appreciate-but did.  Great technology allowed staff to show you what’s going on with your teeth, not just tell you.  Everyone on the team introduced themselves, and shared their background in dentistry and with Dr. Pam’s practice. Hygienist explained everything she was going to do, with several check-ins to make sure I was OK. And Dr. Pam - truly a wonderful dentist! She told me things about my mouth, teeth, jaw, oral cancer, bite, and bone density that I have never been told before.  For my first visit-look, Mom!  No cavities!  To address long-standing issues that cause me distress, she’s going to confer with a specialist from the bay area to see which avenue of treatment may be most beneficial in the long run, and cost effective. There’s another first for me.  Sound a little too good to be true? I didn’t receive a coffee card, points, or any perks for this review.  Just really happy I found a great dentist and dental professionals for me and my family. It’s a relief.< /text>< pics>

Just the best dental office anywhere.  Staff are ALL fantastic, office space is warm and welcoming, family friendly-bring your kids.  Patients are treated with respect and as an equal partner-our ideas, questions, opinions are highly valued and listened to.  We’ve been patients since 1985-we moved out of Sacto and still come for our dental care.  Please don’t ever retire Dr. Pam!< /review>

< Review>
I had to have porcelain crowns for my upper front teeth and because of that needed a new mouth guard.  Dr. Pam DiTomasso and staff were professional, informative, and most of all good human beings.

Dr. Pam and staff are interested in all aspects of the process.  My tooth guard needed to be adjusted to properly fit my mouth and the staff worked directly with me to get me an appointment right away.

Thank you to the entire staff and the resolution of all the issues that arose and for being such great people to work with.<//Review>

<Review>I have to first say, all of the staff here are incredibly friendly and nice. They seem to really enjoy their jobs here, which is such a nice atmosphere to be in. I've had a lot of work done here over the past couple of months, and most of it was couldn't have been done better. When I did have an issue with a crown they put it, Dr. Pam contacted me to make it right. She is so nice and does really listen to you and your concerns. I really really appreciated it, and if you are looking for a dentist, you should come here. Thanks again!< /Review>< pictures>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>Every time I have an appointment at DiTomasso dental, it’s such a good experience.
If I had had dentists like these throughout my life, I would have gone regularly. However, that wasn’t the case. I had my fair share of dental disasters. Maybe that has made me more appreciative them. Bad experiences or not, the bottoms line is they will give you excellent care, always make sure you are comfortable and in no pain. Everyone in the office is knowledgeable, friendly and helpful. I love my dentist!</Review>< pictures>

Dr DiTomasso and her staff are all excellent. They make your experience as painless as possible and strive to be exceptional, taking into consideration tooth or gum sensitivity, time constraints, mouth pain, dry lips or whatever your particular issues are. I’ve been going to this office for 8-10 years and think they’re fantastic. The staff spirit is great- -always so happy. Love that they have office birthday and holiday parties, themed days, wear a different color of scrubs daily, and live who they work for! Thank you thank Kate, who takes such special care to prevent pain during m cleanings as I have gum recession! She’s fantastic.</text>

<Text>This office is awesome. It's hard to say all this without a big smile on my face. I was impressed. I was told exactly what was going to be done and why. They listened and I mean listened to all my concerns. I like details and they patiently explained everything. At the end when money was explained again they informed me about my plan with Delta dental. Even with that they were honest and said they can't always estimate exactly but would help me get the answers they may not know with my benefits. I only wrote this after I had many visits and I think they're great still. It was all true from the beginning. They may cost more but it is worth it.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Always a great experience when I visit Dr. Stella and Shannon, along with the rest of the staff.  Cheerful reception when I arrive, quick and easy X-rays, awesome hygienist in Shannon, and extreme confidence in Dr. Stella when she handles my dental care.

The level of service has remained excellent throughout the 25+ years that Dr. Pam and Dr. Stella have been my dentists.  They are very sensitive to my various health needs as they impact my dental situation.  I my opinion, their high level of integrity, knowledge and compassion is almost impossible to match.<//review>

Great experience!   Kind, compassionate, gentle, and caring.   WONDERFUL Dentist, FANTASTIC Dental Assistants, technicians, and staff.

On a mother note, the quoted insurance company covered less that the expected amount...  double check cost vs coverage before committing to services.  It is your respondsibility.

They make going to the dentist a pleasure.  They are really friendly, make you feel welcome and really care about making the experience comfortable. They are knowledgeable and you can trust their recommendations. I have been going to this dental practice for more than 25 years and highly recommend them..<//Review>

<review>I had a tooth extracted. Dr. Stella's chair side manner is awesome! She explains everything that she is going to do and constantly asks how you are doing. Even though she said I might feel a prick, I never felt the needle at all. She discussed options with me and respected my opinion. This is one of the reasons I have been a patient with this office for 20+ years.<//review>< resp>

As is most typical of a trip to the Dentist. I was greeted with warmth and professionalism. I had a an unplanned problem with my mouth guard to discuss and two fillings. I walked out one hour later with everything handled and a sense of confidence and security with my dental health. The team at Dr. DiTomasso is always striving to give their clients the latest and greatest services. I highly recommend them for all of your dental needs.</text>

< Review>
The very first dentist experience I can remember was jumping out of the dentist chair and running straight into my mom's arms because I was so scared. They had to hold me down the rest of the appointment. I would have never thought after that first traumatizing experience that I would be such a fan of a DENTIST! But here, from the moment you walk in and are greeted by Tanya or Mariann with a warm smile, the experience is always a pleasant one. They are a step above the rest because unlike so many other businesses the great hospitality does not just stop there. My hygienist, Jonae always gets me promptly for my appointment and greets me by name which makes me feel valued and welcomed. She is always so concerned if I am comfortable and always takes the time to explain what she is doing to keep me in the loop. When Dr. Pam comes in to check-in she always gives me great innovative, and cost effective tips on how to keep my gums in great condition and my teeth healthy and sparkling white. It is clear that the employees here all care about the general well-being of the patients and are passionate about what they do. I highly recommend this Dental Office.</Review>

I am absolutely terrified of dental work. Amy the hygienist really took her time with me, talked  me through and really paid attention to my body language. Dr Pam understands my fears & works with them, along with her staff. I'm actually starting to become more comfortable with the dental work. They truly want to make you feel comfortable & take pride in their work. A special thank you to Jessica too.<//Review>

As always I had great experience with DiTomasso Dental - parking, kid room with toys, games on Ipad for my two years old and the cleaning was superb.  I was well informed before doing any works and what I like most is that they will try treatments in their office as they can to avoid sending to periodontics which is more invasive.<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I really appreciate Dr. Stella giving me a chance to postpone work on two of my teeth until next time I'm back from China. Also, the dentist who replaced my two fillings after cleaning out the decay (I did not catch her name-- the one of Persian origin), did a fantastic job along with her helper on my teeth. The work she did was quick, painless and thorough. I am very happy with the result. She explained very clearly to me what I needed to be aware of in order to minimize the potential for problems with the two teeth that I postponed work on. Both her and the dental assistant (forgot her name too) were very professional and friendly. In fact, I am always amazed by the friendly nature maintained at DiTomasso Dental every time I come in. The office is just a wonderful example of how to run such a service.<//review>< Pictures>

Went in as an emergency first visit and was extremely well-cared for and given extra time and attention to make a temporary "repair" until my next appointment. I'm very impressed with the training of the staff, the congenial atmosphere and pleasant professionalism.</Text>

<text>Dr. Prodhan is my hero. I was experiencing pain and headaches for months and finally went to the dentist to get it checked out. I was preparing for a root canal, but Dr. Prodhan was very gentle and patient. She  determined it was just an issue with my bite. She fixed it and the pain was gone by that night. I've been going here for years and everyone is exceptional. Dr. Prodhan is a great addition to the office.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmap_id>0x809ad0c04dbb770d:0x51de13e86048d13e< /gmap_id>< rating>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>I have been going to Di Tomasso Dental for over 20 years.  The most friendly and skilled dental office in Sacramento. I recommend them to co-workers and family all the time. DiTomasso Dental has most advanced technology and is always up on the latest procedures, like their in house crown maker!  If you deal with anxiety over going to the dentist, this place will have you relaxed in no time. The procedures here are pain free and they will not let you have a painfull experience. Now days utilizing and getting the most out of your insurance is an important aspect of your dental health and DiTomasso takes the time to explain and ge t the most out of you coverage.

Went to get scene and couldn't because they only accept delta dental they don't except medical even though their website stated that they accept most insurance companies. But how can u except most insurance companies if you only accept delta dental that doesn't make sense. I will never go here I even considered getting delta dental then looked it up and it's extremely  expensive. Not worth it I will stick with my insurance.<//text>

<text>Place is under new ownership, I had been to the previous place once or twice but was not that impressed with the food or cleanliness. Now the place is very clean, we tried the gyro and combo platter. Both were very good, had lots of flavors and was fresh. We will definitely be going back.</text>< pics>

< Review>
Gyro and fries were pretty good - and cooked fresh to order! I always drive by and never see anyone inside - so all of the positive reviews were encouraging. More could be done on the interior - does look a bit "undone" and the bathroom was out of order, but I would return.<//Review>

<text>One of the best Gyros I've had. Talked to the owners just a few days after they opened up shop, and it's a great place to eat authentic Greek food, made by small Greek business owners, and feel satisfied. The fries are also awesome!</text>< Name>

<Text>The food was amazing. I waited a little longer than I would've liked and the staff was very apologetic and attentive. I hadn't said I was tired of waiting but they could tell so they gave me a free dessert which was so nice I felt bad for being impatient.</Text>< Pics>

This place has been opened for a few months, but it doesn't look they get enough traffic. I've tried their gyros a few times, and they're decent. Not the best I've had, but definitely not the worst. I'd go there from time to time again if I'm craving for some gyros.

The thing is, there's nothing special about the shop itself. Decoration is pretty bland and nothing going on I usually just get my food to go. They probably should try a bit harder making customers comfortable.< /Text>

Great place for a tasty Gyros. Friendly folks who make the Gyros just the way you ask them. Removing 1 star from earlier review as the place was quite dirty this time and felt unorganized.< /Review>

<Review>We were looking for a new dining room set and wanted the Bar height set, we had looked at several places to compare price and brands, when we came to Mathis Brotgers we found the perfect set. We went back too see if the set was available and it was. The sales man, Mario was very pleasant and knowledgeable,  we knew what we wanted so it was a very smooth and fast transaction,  we saved on delivery  by picking up ourselves.  We will definitely go back to purchase a new living room set in the future.  Very pleased with Mathis Brothers.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating><Response>{'time': 1623851007821, 'text': "Hi, Connie.

Came in to window shop and a sweet gentleman by the name of Richard Johns helped us. He was very informative and very patient with us while we selected what we wanted. He also was able to help my daughter and son in law with their purchase. So it was great to deal with someone who was so thoughtful, easy to talk with, and a pleasure throughout the process from beginning to end.</Review>

MB sells furniture you'd upgrade from Ikea when you can afford it (worth saving until you are ready to buy). It has furniture for many price points and tastes. Expect to pay serious money for furniture that can withstand the test of time if you are selective about what you buy that doesn't age you through your furniture.  Many salespersons are pushy, some will respect your space.< /Review>

Mathis Bros has an amazing selection of furniture!  It’s a huge furniture store to furnish every part of your home. Especially loved all the different styles and colors of living room and bedroom furniture.
Employee staff was very friendly and helpful!</text>

Mario is a fantastic salesman. He is very helpful and attentive. I purchased a leather couch and he answered all my questions and helped me all the way along the purchase and delivery process. He is very true to his promises. He is very professional! He efficiently assisted me to purchase a new chair to match my first purchase!   My experience is that Mathis Brothers is a great company and are committed to making their customers happy. I plan on purchasing all furniture items from this company in the future.< /Text>

I  highly recommend Lori Villa who was my sales associate. Very personable, no pushiness, asked what I was looking for and then took us to the location and let us look around without hovering.  Which was a very nice experience. She gave me her business card and when we made our decision I called her and Lori completed our transaction in less than 10 minutes.  Excellent service.<//Review>

Mathis Brothers is a place i feel most comfortable buying.
They stand behind there products and most of all i love the prices and sales associates.
I always come here first before shopping anywhere else.
Easy to communicate to anyone in the store.
Even phone access to human beings besides talking to machines.
Love this store.....< /Text>

Javier Rodriguez was our sales associate. From the minute we walked into the store, he was extremely friendly, courteous, helpful and very knowledgeable. He helped us select the sofa, loveseat and ottoman that we previously saw on their website. Javier made our entire transaction super smooth. He was a superstar & we would return to Mathis Brothers because of his awesome customer service.<//Text>

<Review>Ask for Rosemary Ramirez. She helped my boyfriend and I choose the perfect mattress and gave us an amazing deal. We had a wonderful experience with her. She was so informative and really cared about our likes and dislikes. Never pushed us.<//Review>< Date>

The show room was packed Sunday afternoon, I wasn’t expecting to get much help but right from the start, Luke introduced himself and asked what we where looking for, he took us right to the dining room tables and he stuck with us the entire time, he did give us our space to look around but was close by if we had a question or needed him to take measurements. The best thing about Mathis Bros. Is that they have a large selection more than other furniture stores I have visited and the Ontario location has the warehouse on premises so it was great to be able to choose a dining set and be able to take it home the same day, not like other stores you have to wait for them to be in stock and then wait for a delivery date, I will definitely be back to shop for more! Thanks Luke for all your help!< /text>

<time>1619676470242<//time><rating>1</rating><Review>On Thursday April 8,  2 rocker swivel chairs were delivered and setup in my living room, the chairs appeared to be fine after I sat in them.  When my husband returned home and sat in one of the chairs, the back felt out of alignment so that you cannot sit in it.  I have called five times including to the salesman for repair.  It is now April 21 and still no callback.  This is a customer service fail.  I suggest caution if having furniture delivered.  Check it thoroughly before signing the delivery receipt!  I will continue to pursue this.  It looks like a single bolt is missing...should have been a quick fix.
It is now April 28:  No response from Mathis Brothers.  So much for their guarantee.  I will not be purchasing the rest of my furniture from them.<//Review>< pics>

< Review>
After shopping a few different online stores looking for furniture we found what we were looking for at Mathis Brothers. We wanted full delivery in-room delivery but couldn't find that option on the website. I called the toll free# and Ms. Lacie Dunbar answered. My experience wth her was one of the best retail experiences I've ever had. She was equally professional and cheerful. She was able to answer all my questions quickly and thoroughly. The whole process of placing my order, setting up the proper delivery, payment, and confirmation was less than 10 minutes and it was a joy. When I asked if there was a survey link or supervisor contact so I could share my experience she wasn't sure because no one had ever asked to leave a comment. That's a tragedy because people need to be recognized for superior performance not just for mistakes and failures. I hope her supervisor sees this and she gets the acknowledgement she deserves.  I will continue to shop with Mathis Brothers for the foreseeable future because of LACIE DUNBAR. Excellent employee with a real attitude for customer service. Thank you.< /Review>

I just had the worst experience in my entire life trying to purchase furniture at the Mathis Brothers store in Rancho Cucamonga!  Silly me...I thought they were in the business of selling furniture.   They canceled our order that  we'd been waiting for for 6 months without a phone call or email to let us know what was going on. When I asked them to reinstate the original order since it was clearly their fault that this happened, the store manager said "I can't do that".  The price had gone up within the 6 months of us waiting for our order. To rectify the situation,  h
e was willing to charge us the new and higher price!  That was an additional $300 plus we would have to wait an additional 3 or 4 months to get our furniture.   We ended up walking out and Mathis Brothers lost our business.   I guess their priority is not selling furniture.  So very sad!</Text>

Val, was our salesperson and a great one at that! Val was professional and interested in our needs and preferences to guide us accordingly.
No pressure and made suggestions which helped us make informed decisions.
We will definitely suggest Val is the salesperson to ask for.<//text>

Salesman were not pushy. I was shown the recliners and I said let me look for a while here.   I found the recliners and was contacted if I needed help.

I did and bought them.

Great adventure!    I will return again.

Thanks again.< /Text>

My husband and I are returning customers and love the furniture we buy here. We started with purchasing a bedroom set, then a couch, and now now a new mattress. So excited to own the purple mattress for better sleep. Special thanks to Kevin our sales rep for giving us great customer service. In the future, we look forward to upgrading our dining table.< /Text>

Wonderful selection, helpful staff, terrific prices. My wife and I came here for two pieces of furniture and ended up walking away with a whole set at the same price we had come prepared to spend on far less. Also, the fact that the business is so well-stocked despite coronavirus shortages is impressive. This will be our first stop for new furniture from now on.<//Text>

<review>As a repeat customer, I’ve never had a bad customer service experience with Mathis Bros until today. My wife and I went in to purchase a new office chair because the price was unbeatable for the quality. We were never greeted nor approached to see if we needed help although there were at least 5 salespeople standing around a desk near the recliner chairs. We searched the store and eventually found the chair but my wife had to go get someone to help us make the purchase.

The salesman who came over never introduced himself or anything, he literally walked over and the first thing he said “the warehouse is probably closed so you’ll have to come back after next Tuesday because the store will be closed Easter Sunday and Monday”. I informed him that I only want the office chair and if he could at least check if someone can bring it out. He said he would go check with a manger after I made the purchase. When I said no to those terms, he walked off to help someone else and just left us!!! We were very polite so naturally we were stunned and confused!

One thing I will never do is force a store to take my money when they don’t want it or deserve it. I guess my purchase wasn’t big enough for him to care about what I needed. Not to mention we drove 30 miles for this mistreatment. I’m extremely disappointed and bothered by his actions. I’m so disappointed that I’m willing to come back and point this guy out to a manager. You guys can check your cameras and see for yourselves.<//review>< Pictures>

We went looking for a new couch and ended up at Mathis Brothers. We have bought items before and figured we could find something that would suit our fancy. Hanz helped at first. He was friendly and kind and worked with us to find us the best deal. We went to the Café and had a yummy smoothie and pizza while we discussed our options. We noticed the clearance section  was open, which is always fun to look around. We found a couch that was comfortable and the smaller size we were looking to purchase. Ethan helped us he even showed us the bottom of the couch. He reminded us that clearance items might have damage which he pointed out to us. He was friendly and easy going. Both sales representatives were top notch! We realized on the way home that we have bought now 2 couches, a bedroom set and rugs. Mathis is our go to place. We even get our couch on Thursday! yippy<//text>

A week ago, the floor sales Cole Sojak greeted me as soon as I walked in.  He inquired what I need and any specific color or design I preferred.  We just bought a new home in Pasadena and this need almost everything.   Cole spent at least 1 hr to show me the pieces I might like.  He took measurements of the pieces I liked, checked price, inventory and delivery schedule for me.  I told him I was overwhelmed with so many pieces and info and needed to discuss with family.  He is of great understanding and not like those who pushed you to buy what you are not so sure.  I came home to study some brands, sizes and designs online and find the furniture I like. I texted him for more pricing, design ideas and he was quick to reply.  I went back today and he spend 2 hours at least to work on my order and I really appreciate the efforts and easiness he had offered.  It’s such a pleasant experience that I recommend him to all my families and friends.<//Text>

<Review>I am a repeat customer. It’s always fun to look around your store because there are so many options. I found exactly what I needed; however, the store didn’t have the color I wanted in stock. It’s going to take about five months before I can enjoy my bed and I look forward to that. Dan was very helpful and I appreciated his assistance.<//Review>< GmapID>

Van didn't hassle us, which was awesome. Gave us his card and we called him when we were ready. There was an issue with the online price and actual store price, but Van called the Store Manager and it was handled without issue. Same item at Ashley had 12-16 week wait time. My delivery was scheduled for 2 days later.... and the item is made by Ashley? First time shopping here... won't be my last!  Love the store, merchandise available and staff. Top notch  ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//Review>

There is never any pressure to buy and your sales rep is always there to help.  However, the checking out needs a more efficient process.  Because I had a large order, it took 1 hour and 10 minutes to check stock, find out the bed I chose was unavailable, verify the items, enter the order, and then go to the cashier to pay.  That was uninviting process.  My sales rep and his manager were of good spirits during that process.  Overall I will definitely shop there again!<//text>< gmap_id>

Shopping Mathis Brothers Furniture was a wonderful experience.  Who really go shopping?  Never finding what you want. All the hassle and paper work of large purchase.  experience at Mathis with, was smooth and seamless.  Priscilla's knowledge of the merchandise and our needs,  led us directly to what we found to be exactly right for the room we needed a sofa for.  Priscilla was professional, knowledgeable, personable with a no hurry attitude.  I found what I wanted.  She did all the work. Took her time with us, and made the experience one I did not regret.  We even bought more than we had intended; buying an area rug to go with the sofa.  Congratulations, Priscilla, on being and exquisite employee for Mathis Brothers.  On top of that, what a great selection of merchandise, and our sofa was in stock with no waiting 6 months for delivery.</text>

<Review>I came in on memorial day to buy a new mattress. I was greeted immediately at the cafe onsite by a charming stylish sales associate named Joshua Bowman. He made me laugh immediately. I later found him working on the computer and he stopped to answer my questions about a mattress I wanted. He engaged with my young daughter in a sweet playful way during the transaction and sent her home with a KitKat bar. The whole process was done with ease and no hassle. I was very pleased with the exceptional service, the affordability and immediate availability of my mattresses.< /Review><rating>5</rating><response>{'time': 1622569163498, 'text': "Thank you for the review, Janelle!

<Review>Worst experience ever. When I came in the door, nobody helped me. I had to ask a sales guy where the office area was. When I picked my item I went to the counter and the lady asked me who helped me. I said nobody. A sales guy next to me said, I’ll put the order in.  I said nope I don’t want you to. Why would he get credit or commissions off that sale.  Then the lady tried to sale  me on delivery with a membership. Manage had to come and help use but as I was waiting he was calling 5 people about other stuff while I was waiting and then I couldn’t get the item and walked out.  Buy online is way better. Nobody wants to work!<//Review>< pics>

Zero instructions for $180 upgrade (approx) to swivel base. Springs are under pressure.  Also, replacement base has wood in the path of the screws, which results in screws getting stripped, rendering them worthless. Absolutely  terrible. Lazy Boy or Mathis correct this oversight.  Spend over $1600 dollars and get IKEA garbage is unacceptable.< /review>

Be carefull with what you buy. I bought a sectional about 1 year ago and it started making some noices when you sit on it, I even bought warranty for it. I wanted something nice and durable, but after 1 year, warranty does not cover those problems. Very disappointed on this. Don't even bother on buying extra warranty on it, it sucks.<//text>

Mathis Brothers provided great service. Provided a clean show room, and had a wide variety to choose from. We were assisted by Jake Gutierrez who created a family like atmosphere.

<Review>As soon as I walked in I was greeted and asked what I might be looking for. A sofa I said. I have a sectional now but its too big. I want one about 80". She took me right to the few they had. They were exactly what I had in mind and I bought one. I asked if it came in different colors. She took me to large rack of sample materials, I picked one out and was done. I thought that would be the first of many trips looking at sofas but was happy to be done with it so easily and quickly.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>My wife and I had a good experience at Mathis Brothers today. Our salesperson , Ramzi, showed us several good options for what we were looking for and helped us understand the features as well as the pricing breakdown. They had a great showroom offering a variety of furniture. I would highly recommend anyone shop there before they purchase at any other store.  .< /text>< pictures>

<Review>The only reason I'm giving this four stars is because I called about five times trying to get a hold of somebody about an item in the clearance department. The times I did get a hold of a employee before Denise they were very dismissive and didn't want to fulfill my question of why the item was on clearance. But Denise did! She is wonderful. Give her a raise Mathis Brothers.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Mathis Brothers was our 3rd stop of the big 3 furniture retailers shopping for our new sofa. No comparison. Scott greeted us and then left us to browse at our leisure. Their selection was much better than Mor and Living Spaces and so was the service. When we found the perfect sofa, Scott was right there to help. The transaction was quick and Scott explained the details of the sale and delivery well. Unlike the 16 week delivery of a lesser sofa at Mor, or the stained "not available for delivery" close outs at Living Spaces, we will have a brand new sofa this Friday!! Can't wait!</text>

Great experience.  Staff was attentive and helpful and we found a nice leather couch that is perfect for our family room.  They even extended a 10 percent discount off an already discounted sale price.  We are quite satisfied.  The only challenge is our purchase cannot be delivered until June because COVID has affected their ability to ship certain items in a timely fashion.  Other than that I will continue to be a Mathis Bros. customer...and we live an hour away from the store!< /text>

Had the best experience there. If you need help with anything GO with Valerie. She was super helpful and kind. I got a mattress there and got it delivered. When the men came to install it, they forgot to give me the bed control. I called Valerie and she told me IF she had to she will bring it. She goes beyond for her clients.< /Review>

We purchased a bed along with an entertainment center.  We were told the bed would be delivered the following day.  Before leaving we confirmed with our sales representative that the bed would be delivered the following day and he assured us it would be.  Since we were told they didn't know what time the bed would be delivered we woke up early took apart our bed and waited for the delivery. At the end of the day we telephoned Mathis Bros. only to be told the shipment was never imputed into the system for delivery. After numerous attempts to get a hold of a manager we were informed we would have to wait another 2 days before our bed would be delivered. In the future i will get in writing when the delivery will be made and hopefully that will insure a mistake like this doesn't happen again.< /text>

<review>Very Bad Service...I purchase a couch from the Ontario Location.  I had the couch for about 5 years. I called to have the couch repaired and had to call the store over 5 times trying to get my couch fixed. I spoke to the a Sales Associate /Marty and she was no help. I requested to speak to a Supervisor or a Manager. Marty stated she will have Maria call be back within 1 hour and did not receive a call back. I called back the next day and for the next 3 days with no response back. I called back and spoke to Selena and she advise me I have a warranty for 5 years. I spoke to Marty she stated she will have Mathis Brothers come pick up the couch and fix it. Mathis Brothers came to pick up the couch May 15,2021. I received a call 5/23/2021 from Lisa she stated Marty made a mistake and had Mathis Brothers come pick up the couch and GBS is suppose to fix the couch. They will set an appointment for GBS to come out after I receive my couch. I advised Lisa & Marty that this  is their error and it is UNACCEPTABLE.  I will not ever purchase anything else from Mathis Brothers. I give this Store 0 stars.

<Text>I was shopping for a recliner. I was met by salesman Scott Mc leod. I told him what I wanted and he took me to recliners. When I found the one I liked, he said sit in it for 5 minutes and make sure you really like it. He waited quietly while settled in. Well I bought the chair. Scott is a great no pressure understanding salesman. Thanks Scott.< /Text><response>{'time': 1620073771507, 'text': "Thank you for the review!

Walter was very accommodating and really listened to what we are looking for.  He went above and beyond so we can get the deal we wanted.  They also have a great selection and a huge showroom. We will definitely go back to there to buy other furnitures we need.< /Text>

<Review>Mathis Bros is the best furniture store!!!!  They take your temperature at the door and ask if you have had Covid symptoms.  Then you are given a wrist band to show that you have been cleared to enter.  I was greeted by an excellent sales lady, Rosa Ortiz, who helped me pick out a mattress.  She was so very knowledgeable, asked me all the important questions.  She provided a sanitary cloth for me to lie on so I could test the comfort level of the mattress.  I had visited some other store for mattresses earlier in the day.  That other store took no health precautions.  I highly recommend Mathis Brothers.  I have shopped there before and have always been very impressed.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

Great service. Felipe was the perfect sales associate, not pushy, got my style vibe immediately, carried a large cushion around so I could match,  and showed me all the options. Very knowledgeable too. He knew I wasn’t a lookie-loo and valued my time with his efficiency  and being there to answer all my questions. An awesome  experience!</review>

Purchased over $1,000 bed set yesterday and when we got home to open the boxes, missing hardware so we couldn’t put the bed together and the top of the headboard had a small dent/chip right in the middle of it. We then called the place which they were nice on the phone but when we came to pick up the hardware the next day, we waited roughly 30 minutes for simple hardware...what a joke. This place needs to hire better people that know what they’re actually doing. Not very professional in this department!<//review>

I HIGHLY recommend VINCE at Mathis Furniture. As soon as we walked in we noticed that the store was clean, organized and that they were taking appropriate COVID precautions which made us feel safe! Vince was the first sales associate to greet us, he asked us what we were looking for and knew exactly what pieces to show us based off my very specific needs. Vince is not your typical “sales person” he was very focused on service rather than making the sale. We were showed a wide variety of products and were given an abundance of helpful information on each piece to help make the right decision for us! Go to Mathis Ontario right now and ask for Vince. 10/10 will be returning to Mathis to continue furnishing our home. Thank you Vince!!</text>

Great 5 star experience purchasing from Matthis brothers. Valarie Pulido the sales associate was extremely helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. I highly recommend asking for Valarie Pulido  with my background in sales for 10 years I must say she executed everything to a T. Not only did I learn about mattresses but I’m excited for A good night sleep on my new Mattress . Thank you Valarie!!!<//Text>

< Review>
My choice to leave 1 star was for the respectful and helpful service we received from Carolyn at the Ontario Matthis Brother's  showroom today, June 13th at 5:20pm.  Less than a year ago, my son Nicholas and I decided to purchase our very 1st sofa at Matthis Brothers after visiting many other furniture stores.  As a single parent, we've  been fortunate family and friends have given us their used furniture.  This purchase was meaningful because it was our first and also because we fell in love with the color, material,, feel, and and comfort of the sectional.  The price was beyond our means, so we thought about the purchase well. Eric helped us and was good at selling us the sofa, cleaning warranty, arranging shipping, telling us we would get money back with rewards.
2 months after delivery, the sofa began to dropped , and we noticed 2 of the backs were missing filling because they were not at shapely or firm as the other.  I called Eric right away, and he told me to take them to service area because they would not be picked up.  Today, we finally made the trip and took 2 seat cushions and 2 backs.  The manager, Maria was not helpful and told me that without my receipt, she couldn't help me.  I insisted of a different way to find my info beside my name and phone number.  I mentioned I have the reward program and receive emails.  Her approach was like pulling teeth.  Instead of finding solutions for me, she immediately dismissed my frustration of having to return from L.A. to find a receipt that I might no longer have.  I called Eric and placed him on speaker. He couldn't help.  Finally we went onto the store, and two young ladies at the front counter couldn't help me either.  Instead of directing me to a manager, I had to ask for one.
I'm grateful, Carolyn knew what to do.  She graciously helped us...with a smile.   I didn't have to buy a 4K  sectional from her to be treated with respect. Before Carolyn helped us, I did ask to have Eric meet us.  By the time Carolyn was helping us, Eric arrived.  I shared with him that he did not enter my first name or my phone number on my account, and because of this, Maria could not help me.   His reply was defensive as he shared that has never happened to him before.
I want to be respected as a customer whether I purchase a 4K sofa or not.   The 1 star is therefore given for Carolyn's support.<//Review>

<Review>Mathis Brothers certainly has a large inventory to choose from.  Sales person we had was very friendly and knowledgeable.  We told her what we were interested in and took us directly to that section.  No pressure.  Would recommend Mathis Bro’s. Prices are good and selection great.< /Review>< pics>

I went into this store with my sister who was looking for a new bed. I wasn’t in the market for a new bedroom set. But the styles and cost were so good I found a set that I had looked at 8 or 9 months prior. Manny Arteaga introduced himself and allowed us just enough time to see some things and have questions. He was able to answer our every question and I made the purchase. What an awesome salesman he was and he even told me about the rewards program that was awesome so I got that as well. I’m super excited about my new bedroom coming in May. Yay!!! Thanks Manny 😃<//review>

I’d never been in here before, and not a lot of furniture shopping period. I was amazed at the size of the place but also the coordinated effort of the sales team, like a well oiled machine!
Our sales crew was great. We started off with Erika who, when we described what we were looking for, took us straight to the living room set we ended up ordering. She handed us off to Jake when her two boys and husband showed up with Valentine’s Day flowers and balloons, so she took a lunch break.
Jake was great! He set us up with all the sectional pieces in the color we wanted. Plus got us a better warranty and protection plan than the Lazyboy store and for a better price.<//review>

I got to the store 30 minutes before closing and told the sales associate what I was looking for. She took us to the kids bedroom section and my niece and nephew was overwhelmed.  She help them narrow down their choices and we were able to get 2 twin bedroom sets without any arguments from the kids. The prices were great and everything was in stock except the grey chest. I am so happy to be able to finish their rooms within the next week. Unlike some other stores who have everything on backorder for 12 week.<//text>

<Review>Not happy! From day 1 they sent me a chair with a loose arm rest. They picked it up and returned it a couple of weeks later with the same issue plus scratches on the bottom wood molding. It came back worst that when they took it. Asked for a refund and they will only give me store credit. Ask for replacement and they don’t have it in stock until next year, not sure how long until they have it. First person told me that it would be mid January and today I spoke with someone and they said that she was wrong that it might be until March. So now I’m without a chair for who knows how long. Will not shop here again.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>They do not care at all about customer satisfaction/service. I contacted them via Facebook regarding a negative experience & initially they said to reach out if I experienced any further difficulty. I did have a series of continued negative experiences so I did contact them.They viewed the message & never responded. I responded on Yelp, no response. Then I emailed them, & again no response.

Update: In response to the response provided. If you would care to listen that was my entire point. The incident did actually occur in a single scenario which I have explained multiple times. The protection plan company denied my claim implying that I lied about what happened. I have made multiple attempts to discuss this & no one has made any effort to listen. Even in this response, you are not addressing the fact that no one has been willing to acknowledge that I have an appeal to the denial. This reinforces my point. No communication equals poor regard for your customers.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Our sale assistant Damian was very helpful by taking his time to show plus explain makes and fabric. The reason I give Mathis Brothers three stars is they charge you $350 for delivery. That wasn't told to us until after we'd decided to purchase. I lost my mind at this,  other stores we showed had free to $100 delivery fees. They should teach their salespeople to be up front with that in the beginning of the sale.  That or have it posted everywhere throughout the store. Matthias Brothers should be ashamed of themselves!!! So just remember if you spend over two grand on furniture add a extra $500 for warranty and delivery....<//Review>< Date>

While we try to keep delivery costs to a minimum, the fees go to paying our contracted Delivery Team and for fuel and upkeep of their vehicles. Our delivery fees are based on distance and a percentage of the furniture purchased. While rates within our local 20 mile zone are lower, we must charge more for deliveries like yours, where the drivers would be driving nearly 50 miles from our Distribution Center to deliver your furniture in the desert. We do offer free pick up at our Distribution Center if you are able to arrange for a vehicle to haul your sofa and recliner once they are in. We appreciate your business and will be passing along your review to Sales Management so they might address with their team regarding delivery fees.'}<//resp><rating>3</rating></record></dataset><record>

It’s been over 30 days since my friend Cherish and I first rented a truck that cost us over $500 in rental fees, drove over 400 miles there and another 400 miles back from San Francisco to pick up her shelf that cost over $2,800 for her special order.

After unboxing the shelf, there was significant damages, scratches, and paint drips from manufacturing errors.

After trying to contact the Mathis Brothers furniture company, they were hanging up on me , ignoring calls. Now they are telling her she needs to drive the shelf back down to Ontario in order for her to get an exchange. It turns out They have the option of using their own shipping services this entire time. It may not have been such a huge loss of time and expenses had they used their shipping in the first place instead of forcing her to rent a truck no drive over 800 miles round trip to pick up a shelf that was damaged in so many different places. This is supposed to be a high end, brand new shelf. Instead what we got looks like a used poorly designed big lots/Walmart/way fair nightmare.

This might be the worse customer service experience, the worst quality of furniture you’ll ever experience. Our expectations were high due to the overwhelming amount of reviews , over 4,000! But when you actually read the reviews you’ll discover their quality assurance doesn’t exist. They have no care to actually remedy any of the mistakes, issues that their clients come into contact when making purchases with them.< /text>

I loved all the beautiful furniture Stephanie Souen helped me pick out for my Mountain Chateau in Lake Arrowhead California. We had the first delivery today, and there were some items that needed to be changed. I really appreciate Kyle the manager and also Don in furniture sales who helped me to get everything straightened out to my liking. It is a pleasure to be a customer of Mathis brothers, and I will highly recommend them to others.</review>

Mathis Brothers Ontario has great customer service. We’ve purchased multiple items here for our home and everything has always been such great quality pieces. We just purchased a new mattress and base and Kate Newman was very helpful and had us try out several options until we found the mattress and adjustable base for our needs.<//review>

Joseph Hamilton was very professional. It’s got to be hard when customers change there mind about 20 different times while looking (exactly what we did), but he took the time to walk us through it all and explain the different options. and we even shared some laughs.< /Text>

Ordered about $3000 worth of items back in October. The person who sold the items, never expressed a “promotional” fee that would be added as soon as the items were financed. Not only that, but it’s been 4 months and I’m still getting the run around of when the sofa I ordered will be delivered. Went into the Ontario location to try and cancel all of the items and was not able to because the couch I ordered is a custom order so even if I did cancel it, I would still have to pay full price for the couch.< /Text>

I work with a moving company called BELTRAN MOVING and i personally picked up a order for a client. The order was a dinning table and it was damaged.I got to give Mathis Brother Furniture a lot a credit because the client called and with no problems they told the client to bring it back and they will switch it so just a heads up check your orders before you leave.Like that you don't have to go back and make multiple trips. By the way my name is MIKE .
AWESOME KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK.< /Text>

She can find you exactly what you need and give you straight answers about pricing and all charges such as delivery fees or protection plan that upgrades your delivery. Order NOW if you want anything between 3-6 months! There’s a few things in stock.. but, custom orders are taking longer thanks to COVID 😐 at no fault to sales staff or stores. LayZboy stores are 6-8 months out!  Anyway.. I’ve dealt with Lori before. She’s excellent at her knowledge of how things are done and design choices. Highly recommended her.

We purchased a large number of furniture pieces last year. Against our better judgement we also paid for the "protection." One expensive piece was delivered defective and another less expensive piece broke within a few weeks. We have been trying to get someone from Mathis to repair the damage for many months. The run-around, double speak, and no return phone calls has reached a boiling point with us. As far as I am concerned that "protection" insurance is fraud on the basis of unresponsiveness and double speak. While the sales folks were nice as we spent many thousands of dollars, everyone disappears into the woodwork when service is needed.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>There needs to be serious changes in Personnel if Mathis Brothers is to remain in business their current employees is ruining the company name.

The problem was customer service and the warehouse purposely sabotage my order, with the help of corrupt cops posted in the store. They purposely delivered the wrong sofa twice.   The warehouse was trying to convince me that Mathis Brothers Customer Service was the worst, I’m now convinced they are.    Several months later my son had the same problem he was given the run-around by the customer service department they never called to confirm delivery and cancelled several times.  He finally got feed-up went down to the store to picked sofa up, without checking the warehouse personnel still put the wrong sofa in his truck.   Now how sad is this the supervisor needs to be dismissed.<//Text>< Pictures>

If you like professionalism, fast, and excellent service then you need to make a trip out to Mathis Brothers in Ontario.  Thier selection is huge and your items will arrive in a few days. Remember you get wha you pay for.  The furniture here is the best. I promise you you will not regret your trip to Mathis.

You want VIP treatment make sure you ask for Jake Gutierrez.  He makes sure you get exactly what you want and definitely treats you like if you are family.</review>

Do not order custom from here. You will wait 6 months or more. They are having manufacturing issues. They failed to inform me of these issues until months down the line. As of today, still no couch, ottoman, chair or pillows that were ordered back in early September 2020. I was told today that now it will not come until March. I get a different excuses every time. Mathis Brothers has a lot of work to do before I ever become a client again.<//Review>

Mathis Brothers is a little on the pricey side, but the have high quality furniture. You get what you pay for and this set will last years after lesser quality sets start having problems.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131< /gmap_id>< Pics>

I had a great experience using Mathis Brothers. I looked at mattress bases from several stores. Once I made my mind up the sales person Zachary was very knowledgeable and professional.
I would recommend used both Zachary H and Mathis Brothers for not only mattress bases or a mattress, but anything you need for your house.</Text>

< review>
Customer service was fair.  Was disappointed that the first two sets we wanted were on back order for a month or more.  Once finding a set in stock, the salesperson was helping in assisting with the sale.  Pick up was easy.  However, once home, one of our sofa backs was missing a bracket, not allowing for use or completion of installation.   We called and they wanted to mail it out, seven to ten working days.  Unable to confirm all parts as the box was sealed when we picked it up.  Disappointed for what we paid for the set.< /review>

My fiancé and I worked with Zach over the weekend (1/23). He was attentive without being pushy. He said he’d follow up with us today (1/25) in regards to a potential early fulfillment and he actually did! Really appreciate him and sticking to his word. This was our second time attempting to shop at Mathis but was so turned off work how overbearing their sales associates can be. Zach was a breath of fresh air.< /review>

BEWARE BUYERS BEWARE! If a sales person says an item is not in stock, however it is due back in stock in two days or a month, DO NOT ORDER THE ITEM! The sales team is trained to trick the customer into buying now and making you feel like there are other pending orders on the back order items, this is not true at all. DO NOT BUY ANYTHING THAT IS NOT IN STOCK! I personally did this and from two day to a month to two months they keep changing their stories. IT GETS WORSE...They will not refund your money. I have called 5 times, all associates tell you they same thing. They say they will refund your card and it will take 7 to 10 business days to see the refund on your card. Each time....NO REFUND WAS DONE! I am now having to call my bank to try to reverse the funds. Mathis Brothers should be ashamed of their tactics... Over the years I have spent over $40,000.00 and this is how they treat LOYAL CUSTOMERS? I WILL NEVER BUY FROM MATHIS BROTHERS AGAIN! I have never gone to this extreme to write a bad review, however the frustration and time that they have put me through has cost me more than my refund at this point. I have never been so disappointed in a shopping experience like what Mathis Brother Associates have put me through. Buyers, don't buy it, if its not in stock!</Text>

We had a wonderful experience shopping at Mathis Brothers. Our salesman was very nice and patient with us. We came to buy a red recliner, but they didn’t have any. However I did find a really nice power glider love seat spent more than we expected too, but I was happy with our purchase and as we continue to browsed the rest of the store I found two nice rugs they look beautiful on my floor. We spent a lot of money at Mathis brothers that day.
Between July and August of 2020 my nice loveseat stop working, and because I had COVID-19 for four month I couldn’t think where I had put my receipt, I was thinking they were pink, when I found them they were blue. When I called for customer service I didn’t get the service that I expected first of all your customer service young lady  was very short she really didn’t listen at all,  she told me I was  one month late to get my loveseat repaired I am so disappointed. At 75 years old  I am not looking for anything free you would think that customer service representative would had at at least listen to my complaints, but she did not. We spent almost  $2,500.00 in the store that day. That should’ve been an indication that we are good customers. I have been looking for someone to repair my loveseat as of today it’s not working</Text>

The store is huge (upstairs & downstairs).  There's a ton of variety and selection!  Our rep Julianna was great!  No pressure, just very helpful.  She was attentive to our needs and mindful of giving us alone time to discuss our options.  Good/positive experience, would recommend this place for sure!<//Text>

<review>First time we visited. Drove 60 miles to try it and it was better than expected. Derrick Johnson was outstanding as a sales rep. Informed and informative, but never pushy. the scope of options was amazing and we found more than we were looking for at better prices than we had seen in any other place. It's not so easy to get there, but we will go back for significant pieces.</review><gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131<//gmap_id><Rating>5</Rating>< userid>

Not all vendors are 100% fully staffed and many closed down and have had significant back orders to fill. In addition to Covid related delays, shipping delays are also due to a shortage of containers and vessels to load those containers onto and then the barge issue, which was stuck in the Suez canal blocking all vessels carrying merchandise and supplies. This has been a challenging time for everyone and we look forward to things returning to normal! We appreciate your business and the review.'}<//Response>< gmapID>

<text>I had the worst experience through Customer Service, from the day I reported my recliner stopped reclining aft 3 months from my purchase through the day they picked up my recliner, rather than having a technician come out and replace my console cup holder as stated on my invoice.  I am currently working on a complaint from the very first day I had an issue with your customer service.  Also note, it took 2 months to just pick up my recliner and no one in that department knew why.  I hope that your CEO and President, Mr Larry Mathis and Mr Bill Mathis can see this post.  FYI: this occured on the Ontario location.<//text><Name>Teresa Jalocon</Name><Rate>1< /Rate><user_id>103353658778828188513< /user_id><Date>1621139319607< /Date><Response>{'time': 1609358331664, 'text': 'Thank you for the review, Teresa!

<Review>We are shopping for new furniture and reviewing options.  An extremely helpful agent Lori met with us while we found an option to purchase.  It was late and Sunday.  The rep stated she would follow up - and we selected other items before heading home.  She followed up appropriately, and we were happy to find our "options" were available to order.  Since we live an over an hour away, we received email correspondence that we needed to sign and send back.  Good luck with emailing to a "ghost" account, and of course it bounced back.  We contacted the rep and informed her.  Yesterday, I had to be in Riverside and decided best course was to bring signed agreements for the special order and pay the required 40% deposit.  I wanted to reaffirm the other selections that were not special order before proceeding to the cashier line to WAIT.  It's enlightening to listen to other sales reps talking about discounts due to Presidents Day sales.  Finally, a clerk, lacking enthusiasm  waves me forward.  I attempt to provide the signed special order agreements, and my desire to provide the required deposit.  He listens but does not hear?  Instead he directs me to call the phone number on the sales sheet.  Doesn't care to understand that only 3 items were special order and not the entire order.  Again doesn't care and tells me I have attitude.  He had zero interest in the signed special order paperwork.  I chose to leave and pass the front counter asking to speak with a manager to explain.  Sam F is on the phone and when he is done I attempted to enter a dialogue explaining my perception of the clerk and what I wanted to do.  Instead he doesn't listen, and again refers to a total 40% deposit for furniture.    Really?  Is it that difficult to pull apart the pieces and meet your needs wanting 40% down on the total purchases. (the sales rep was off)  Gee an engaged client that is willing to come by the store to ensure the special order items are correct; and cashier staff and manager won't listen to understand.  I was perplexed.

Reading yelp and better business reviews for Mathis Brothers after my experience the ratings are consistent  - poor.  What has happened to customer service?    I'm more than willing to follow processes, but general guidelines don't appear to be known.  In today's internet search environment, anyone can  find the same or very similar items at other stores.  My purchasing choices will be looking elsewhere.< /Review><Rating>1<//Rating>< user>

<text>Just got home with a fake fireplace tv cabinet, pull it out of the box and it’s broke in 3 places. We live 25 miles away and it would be an inconvenience to have to drive back. So we call them to tell them about the problem and asked if they could deliver a new one and take the old one since it was broken in THEIR warehouse. We were told there would be a $70 delivery fee. Although I like Mathis Brothers and have bought many things from them, I will never buy anything from them in the future. Customer service is the ONLY reason I shop at the same stores over and over, and if a store isn’t willing to go above and beyond for something they broke then I don’t want to do business with them.< /text>< Pictures>

Salesman Vince of Mathis Brother's Ontario was very knowledgeable, helpful, & kind. Made us feel at ease when looking for our bedding.
We will definitely be using him again on our next purchase & is highly recommended.< /text>

I think I added my last review way too soon. I feel sorry for the salespeople trying to make a living working for this business.  I guess it might be my fault because I thought after I dumped several thousand dollars down, I didn’t make sure I was buying new undamaged and I stock furniture.  The salesman told me if I waited a week all the pieces would be in for my delivery.  Now I have a piece missing from every room I bought for. I purposely selected furniture that was in stock.  I think I would have been better off buying used damaged furniture from OfferUp.  When I called to ask what happened, the rude customer service gal told me “sorry.”  Now I get to wait three months to get my order.< /Text>

< Review>
Waited nearly an hour in the pick-up area to load my SINGLE item (which was quite light, but wide). I watched as truck after truck which pulled in after me had their orders loaded up before I finally went to ask what was happening with my order. Even then, I'm getting excuses about why it was taking so long and forced to wait even longer until they finally brought my order out. I would have gone in to the warehouse and carried my own order out had I known it was going to take as long as it did. This is likely a sign of poor management and oversight with respect to the loading/pick-up area.< /Review>

I ordered a bedroom set that was supposed to come in 8 weeks but it wasn't like that. Last Friday after 4 months I received the flat panel bed at my home and it was damaged with many scratches. How come I have to wait for something new and after 4 months of waiting it came damaged. I called customer service and no one has solved my problem. I don't want to wait another 4 months for another bed. Shame on Mathis Brothers that they don't care about their customers. It looks like somebody is not doing their job right.<//review>

It seemed that our sales person must have been new as he didn’t have an understanding of what we wanted. At first when we told him he did not listen and took us to the wrong type of beds. After talking with his manager and understanding what we wanted things went smoothly from there.< /review>

<Review>Poor customer service.  I ordered and paid in full in February.  My estimated delivery date came and passed, without any contact.  I reached out to find out that the item was back ordered for another month.  If you aren’t going to be able to fill an order on time, call your customer.  Now it’s April and still haven’t heard anything from them.  I will not be buying from them again.</Review>< Pics>

My husband and I went into Mathis Brothers to look at sofas.  Tony CORTEZ helped us, not only was he very knowledgeable with the products,  fabrics , the build of the furniture he was also very patient.  Along with the sofa we also purchased an outdoor patio swivel chair.
We left very satisfied with the service Tony provided us. Thank you Tony Cortez!</Text>

<review>If I could give Mathis a score below 1 Star I would. We found the perfect sectional and Ottoman and they killed the deal with their associates and customer service. How can I want to spend $6000 and possibly $10k+ and have this service and be charged for delivery? So sad. There is definitely other places I can go to spend my money for my house remodel.
Definitely very disappointed and will never go back to Mathis for anything! Will go spend my money where I can get attentive customer service and salesman who are knowledgeable. It is sad when companies get as big as they are and forget that customer service and acting like they care are a BIG DEAL! The commercials are not true to what they are advertising.<//review>< gmapID>

From the time we walked in to the time we left, Roman was nothing short of an amazing, caring, knowledgeable professional who helped us with every detail. He explained it all to us. Answered our questions to the highest level. Cared about all we were concerned about. Set out to help us get exactly what we want at the time we need it by. This is truly the most amazing sales associate we have we’ve seen or dealt with. We are redecorating the whole house and will be back to buy from Roman. We know what we want and he helps us get exactly what we want when we want or need it. From now on we only go to Roman at Mathis Brothers. This is our go to place. From now on we will be coming and buying our furniture here at Mathis from Roman.
Mathis brothers has the very best quality furniture at the best price around. Highest quality you cannot find anywhere else. Don’t go to anyplace but Mathis for furniture needs. Ask for Roman  you won’t be sorry.

Thank you Mathis brothers. Thank you ROMAN!!

<Review>I had been to several furniture stores before going to Mathis Brothers. Once there, I was able to find the items I wanted, a leather couch, coffee, and two chairs. Their prices are extremely good, as is their service. Thank you, Terry, for your help and patience.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

The 5 stars is for our salesman Dan. We were so very happy with Dan. He spent 2 hours with us helping to finding the perfect leather leather couch. He never complained nor acted tired. He is very knowledgeable about all of the furniture in the store. Dan is a great salesman and I woul recommend him to anyone! Thank you Dan!

As far as the couch we purchased in November 2021, we did not receive our couch until end of December and it was damaged our 2nd couch we received it 2 weeks ago and it was damaged with a large cut in the leather. Our third is being thoroughly checked and will receive it this Saturday. Hopefully it will not be damaged!</text>

Great customer service picking up my furniture.  Not sure how the product is yet.  Would've been 5 stars but they wouldn't allow a family member to pick up the furniture so we had to return the order and reorder having the family member that was picking it up purchase it themselves.  Kind of a hassle but the warehouse guys and sales desk were super nice and helpful once they got there.</Review>

This is absolutely the worst furniture store I have ever been too in my entire existence. I advise anyone looking to purchase furniture to run before spending any of their finances at this place of business. I have purchased multiple pieces and there has always been a problem but for some reason I continue to give them the benefit of the doubt because they once had a good name. I purchased a dining set from Mathis Brothers and once delivered it was entirely damaged— scratches everywhere and when I requested a refund they gave me the run around telling me that I had to email servers people and each of their emails were fake.
Additionally, I purchased a bed set it took five months to come and once I got it delivered their delivery men were rude and very belligerent. They even bumped into me and were attempting to intimidate my daughter and myself by giving us threatening stares; they even continued to slam stuff and ask us if we had certain tools to help them. Once my bed set was delivered it was the wrong size. After waiting five months my bed set was the wrong size! I will never shop here again.<//text>

Customer service was great. Had to wait 3 months for special order tv cabinet. Got it and assembled it only to find out the top of the cabinet was so warped the doors won’t function and the sag in the top reminds me of a 50 year old horse. Customer service was very good but we have to wait another 6 to 8 weeks .</text>

<review>I wanted to thank Rosemary Ramirez for all her help.  She was very professional and was able to make out buying experience very easy.  We had chosen a sofa, love seat and chase about 3 month prior.  She had all our information so she write up and we were out the door.  I will definitely be going back to her in the near future. Mathis Brothers made sure to take your temperature prior to walking in and had you wear a band after asking Covid typical questions.  Felt very comfortable with my overall experience.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

< review>
It is the worst customer service. I regret from the begining that I purchased the bedroom set.
they set up the delivery date and they changed it 3 times.
The worst part when they delivered the set , the handle of dresser drawer was broken.
I called and that to Lisa in customer service department. She said she ordered the part and it would
take 2 weeks. it has been 6 weeks and I talked to Lisa,, Tina, Ray, Marital, and ..... and I have not got the answer .

The worst customer service. Just get the money and do not service to customers.
Never Neve N ever buy from this company.
You  will regret.<//review>

We appreciated the Covid 19 precautions.  Isaa was our Sales Rep.  We told him what we were looking for only expecting to look and bought living room set.  A big plus they have little car strollers for kids. Our 4yr old is ready to go back.  Did I mentioned wide variety.< /Text>

worst furniture experience. Been dealing with a missing piece of furniture since September. All departments passing blame to others. Had to explain my annoying situation to numerous different people. Tried to be patient. Sales Manager Josh told me 3 different times "don't worry, this will get handled and someone will be contacting you". No one ever contacted me, I had to call back once a week and start over. I know its a big company, and my purchase is insignificant, but my experience was completely unsatisfactory, and should be used for training purposes in the future. I lost my temper with Josh towards the end, and I apologize, but the dude was very frustrating.</text>

<review>When I first tried to enter the store I was accosted by an employee regarding my mask. He said I was not able to enter the store with the mask I had on and according to him that was the policy of their HR Dept. When asked to see the policy he could not produce it but insisted that I either exit the store or take a mask from him. I would have loved to exit the store and taken my money and business elsewhere but I was there for my wife who wanted to get a small couch/loveseat for our room...today. I would have rated my experience a zero or one but our sales rep was pleasant, knowledgeable and helpful...Chelsy Kelly thank you for helping my wife find her loveseat and for putting up with my attitude after the whole mask incident. It is because of Chelsey I have rated my experience a 3 but if rated Chelsey by herself it would definitely be a 5!  I will be contacting the HR Dept about their policy which is discriminatory in nature.</review><resp>{'time': 1613657686568, 'text': "PJ, We apologize for any issues you had in shopping with us.

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I wouldn't even give it 1 star, After waiting for over a month for our new bed to be delivered it finally came 2 weeks ago only to be assembled wrong. You see the bed has either Matress only or Mattress and box spring assembly, however the delivery man did not ask which we wanted so when we went to inspect the bed he told us we would need to buy a box spring. When we told him no, we specifically bought only a mattress because the bed was designed for either, he attempted to take the bed apart to fix it, but informed us that he would not be able to and that new rails would need to be ordered. He assured us that we would be getting a call within the hour to set up that delivery. After a few hours I called myself and was told I'd have to wait until the driver actually got back to the warehouse before the parts would be ordered. I called the next day and was sent to 3 different departments, finally someone in dispatch said that the parts had been pulled already and that I would get a call to set up delivery the next day. We'll that didn't happen. When we called to ask about that they said they could send out a maintenance crew to see if they could fix it or we could wait until Monday 11/23 for the new parts to be delivered. We chose to wait for the parts and asked for a supervisor to call us. No one ever called. Now Monday rolls around and they show up with the wrong parts!! So we call Mathis to explain that the wrong parts were sent out, and now we are told that they need to figure out why that happened, and to wait for a call by 7pm today to see when the right parts are going to be delivered. And of course no call!!! This has been a horrible experience. Now we are 2 weeks into waiting for them to fix this situation and just keep getting the run-around. Still waiting to speak to a manager.< /review>< Pictures>

After waiting 6 months for our couch to be delivered, it was delivered with the wrong pieces, customer service made no effort to fix the problem, saying the piece is in the wearhouse but they can't schedule the delivery until Saturday. So now after waiting so long, dealing with multiple "managers" it's a too bad so sad situation. No one has made any effort to take responsibility and do the right thing to get the piece expedited as it was thier mistake to begin with. Picking out your furniture is the easy part, getting them to deliver it is the problem. Once they have your money they don't care.<//Text>

Customer service I feel is a lost art now a days. Yesterday my hope in customer service was renewed. I was quickly greeted by an associate as opposed to walking around what was/is the biggest furniture stores I have ever been inside of. The young woman lead us right to the mattresses that would best suit our sons needs based on his sleeping habits as well as comfort levels. Carolyn was patient and answered all of the questions we had and believe me we had a lot! I think one of the most important aspects of our experience was that she did everything to keep us safe like laying down temporary bedding so that my son could lay down and try different beds out without the fear of transferring pathogens. Lastly, her suggestion on the pillows and sheets was such a great decision my son loves both and just had the best sleep of his life!

For reference my son is a pitcher in college is 19 and a side sleeper but suffers from shoulder stiffness and his old mattress was making it worse</review>

Great store, Great selection, Great prices and Great Salesman Tony.

< review>
I had such a horrible experience with Mathis Brothers. I ordered a living room furniture set (couches and tables) in October and didn't have my complete set delivered to me until February. First I was told they would be delivered in November, when that arrived one of the chairs was broken and my end table was not in stock. They replaced the chair and I was happy with that experience. The end table was scheduled to be delivered in December, and after a two week delay it arrived broken. I called and they told me they would get it to me the first week of January. I had to call to check in again, and they scheduled me for delivery, however the day of the delivery no one showed up and I was told they tagged the furniture wrong. No one ever called me to tell me why I was not getting my delivery. A manager promised me $50 credit and then never followed through. The following week my replacement end table came and it was broken in the truck. I had to go through the process 2 more times until I finally received my table that I paid for 4 months earlier. Each time I had to call and follow-up. None of the departments speak to one another and no one takes ownership when you call and try to find out what is going on. They took my money and didn't care about when I actually got my furniture. I will never shop here again.< /review>

Shawn was my salesman but not once applied any pressure salesman closing techniques. He was thorough with explaining about all options for delivery, extended warranty and membership.

We purchased a bedroom furniture set we along with an outdoor table set were high quality with prices competitive with Ashley's.. were very please to get higher quality furniture  at reasonably low cost. We'll shop here again soon.</Text>

We had a really great experience with Curtis. He was extremely outgoing, helpful, and had great product knowledge which we really appreciated. Even though he was helping others as well, he consistently got back around to us in a timely fashion to answer all of our questions and find the right products for us.
The lack of inventory and time turn around was a little frustrating. It would have been helpful to have that information at the products instead of so much back and forth.</text>

Let me share my pleasant experience at Mathis brothers.

First of all me and my girlfriend were greeted immediately as well as getting our temp checked with some questions in regards to Covid.

Second, my impression of the floor room was it was nice, clean and organized.

Then I had a very nice lady by the name of Wendy Anderson whom made the entire experience amazing.

Not only was she extremely helpful but not once did we feel any sort of pressure which is always appreciated.

Would highly recommend a family or friend.<//review>

<Text>We had a very favorable buying experience. Having first shop on line we went to the store to see the unit we were interested in. Everett was accommodating to take us directly to the unit, we changed our mind seeing another unit close by. Having a fast shopping experience in the covid atmosphere was very comforting. Everett explained our options concisely , took us through the purchase process expeditly , arranged delivery with convenience, thank you Everett< /Text><user>115282857118393140876</user><Time>1599425327846<//Time><Resp>{'time': 1599570985453, 'text': "Thank you for the review, Art!

Mathis Brothers had a great selection and a better price then all five stores I went to. The sales associate that assisted me was Linda Delgado, she was extremely knowledgeable and very Pleasant to work with. She agreed with us when we came in the door and let us look around and found us to help us with what we needed. All the other associates were standing around talking to each other and could care less if you had been helped.<//Text>< pictures>

Had a great shopping experience with Linda D.  We are furnishing a townhouse and she quickly understood our style and needs and expertly put together everything we needed. Linda’s design skills and knowledge of products coupled with her patient, guiding character made for an outstanding first visit to Mathis Brothers.<//review>

We found a very nice leather recliner that I loved, but it was the last 9ne,"floor model", so i inspected it and found a small slice onside of upper part. They would not reduce the price so we left.</Review>

Walking in to Mathis Brothers everyone is super nice & helpful. Me and my family had the pleasure of meeting Chelsy, she is very sweet and nice, easy to talk to didn’t pressure us at all! We were only there to get a brand new dining table and turns out we bought more than what we needed. Definitely will be returning for more furniture.

One last note the first part of our delivery was great, the two men that delivered it to our home were so fast! Under 20 minutes they installed a bed frame, and cleaned up the boxes and stuff!<//text>

<Text>Sales person Derrick Johnsom was awesome.  Issue started after pick-up of the furniture.  Guess we were wrong to assume that we purchased an unused chair.  The  hair was just wrapped in plastic wrap.  Got it home, no power cord.  Chair appeared to be used as it was not in its down position.  Mind you this was a power lift chair.  A call was placed to request a power cord.  Individual who answered phone was accusatory that how was the chair in an upright position if we didn't have a power cord. Said 3 or more weeks to obtain   a cord and 3 months for a replacement chair.  Unacceptable to say the least.
Her name was requested and was hung up on.  Poor customer service.   A second call was placed to our sales person and he was able to obtain a cord.  A second trip was made to pick it up.   The chair controller was powered up, but the chair has failed to work.   Now making a 3rd trip to return/replace the  chair.  Very frustrating.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Chrissy was our sales consultant...very friendly, professional, welcoming, honest and excellent personality, also very patient and experienced.
My wife and I was very happy with the service she offered.
We were referred by our daughter and son in law and could not be happier with the wide selections of furniture and the cleanliness of the store. We left very happy and pleased with our purchase.
Thanks,

The shopping experience is fine, however when you buy an item it cost almost as much as the item to have it delivered. The purchase was $512 and delivery is $289 and then if you need them to haul away old item it is another $125. What ever happened to free delivery?<//review>

Matthew was awesome! He explained the product in its entirety and had the best customer/sales service. He maintained the “no obligation” to buy attitude and we really appreciated it. Definitely will be back to furnish the rest of the home. Thanks Matt!!! :]<//Text>

What a great experience we had with her, she was very  patient and knowledgeable about each department and facet of the house we asked about. Once we got to the 2nd floor, we found a bedroom set that was available right away. She then asked if I wanted to finance it, I was approved and  it will be delivered next week. Batoul was very interesting and welcoming. Thank you very much Batoul. We'll see in a few weeks so my daughter can have the same great experience.  👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
Tyelor in the finance department was also of great service to us. Great personality. Answered all my questions.
We also met Mark another sales associate that was very helpful on the type of furniture we asked about and more.  All around great service. I recommend Mathis Brothers for great furniture and service!!
Thanks so much 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍<//Text>< pictures>

This is a great place to buy furniture, the have a huge showroom and alot of items to choose from, be sure to ask for Lori V, she was super helpful and cute too. She helped me find the perfect sofa, and to top it off it was in the clearance section, and available for immediate pick up. Lori also gave me tons of helpful decorating ideas which was helpful since I am a man and have no idea how to furnish a home. I will definatley be back to buy some area rugs and wall art to complete my space. If your looking for a great shopping experiance with a huge selection I would definatley check out mathis brothers, and be sure to ask for Lori V, if you need some awesome decorating tips, and superb customer service.</review>

I was in need of a new mattress and Sergio Mendez's assistance made the process far more simple than expected. He was direct, very knowledgable responding to the questions I asked, and informed me about the COVID-19 safety practices.

I didn't make my purchase then, but when I called him back, he was remembered me and what we discussed.

Throughout the entire experience he was friendly and helpful.< /text>

Buyer beware!!  Do not place an order for anything as it will not arrive on time. Still waiting on couches I ordered 16 weeks ago and were supposed to arrive within  8-12weeks.  I have spoken to several sales reps and mgrs. and their is no response as to when they will arrive. I understand times are different now but they won’t even consider a refund.  16 weeks in and my answer from Scott who pretended to call the manufacturer was “hopefully” within two weeks. He said the couches are ready to be shipped but they are waiting to fill up a truck to be able to ship. Really?  In more than two weeks they can’t fill a truck with furniture? Ok Scott.< /text>

<Text>Kopipzy Pimental was amazing! She helped us build our dream sofa and sectional with Jonathan Louis Design Lab. We had been searching for the right furniture for months and she helped us finally select our pieces. She was welcoming, efficient, and extremely professional.

< Review>
Mathis has a very large store with a good selection. Late last summer, I purchased just under $19,000 worth of matching patio furniture. First off, they gave me a hard time, because the mailing address of my credit card was my office address, the shipping address of the furniture was my home. This never bothered every company from Costco to Amazon to Apple to (you name it) and various other furniture retailers (I bought a new home last year and need a lot of furniture). Among the items bought at Mathis were four chaise lounges that had a slight design flaw that caused bolts to strip from the frames. Rather than getting a guy out to my house to fix them, I they just wanted to refund the money on the lounges. I didn't want that since the chaises matched everything else, and now they were discontinued items. Even IF they took everything back (they didn't offer), I didn't want that, it was difficult enough to agree with my wife on stuff to begin with.

I went back-and-forth with them for months, including contacting their main office. All I got was either robotic-like answers that they were emailing the manufacturer and even a smarmy Customer Service rep who was not pleasant at all. Their Sales Dept was not helpful, nor their home office.

I just wanted them repaired before summer was over. Ultimately I contacted A.R.T. Furniture (the manufacturer) who not only found a company to repair them, but deposited the cash in my checking account for the repair before the work was even started. A.R.T. was very sympathetic and very professional. Mathis Brothers, not so much.< /Review>

<text>Due to the pandemic, it took 3 weeks after my purchase to actually get the bed I purchased in to my home.  Mathis Brothers was quite professional in the handling of the purchase, delivery, and ultimate delivery. (They fell a little short on the follow up on the delivery scheduling and status of my bed arriving at their store.) Patrick assisted me with my purchase. He was very respectful, patient and accommodating.  The gentlemen who delivered the bed were prompt, professional, polite and all around very nice. Jesse assembled my bed in no time flat. It looks great and I would recommend this store to anyone.<//text>< Name>

We went to Mathis to get new living room set, Kopipzi was very helpful and friendly. She explained everything thoroughly and answered all of our questions. The only thing we are not too happy is we have to wait until late February to have our new couches. The manufacturer needs to improve production.</text>

<Review>While I have mostly enjoyed my Matthis Brothers experience, I am not happy about several things.

We were told by Issa the night we purchased the couch we could buy extra pieces to make the couch bigger at a later date.  He then told us that since we "paid" for the original delivery, we would get anything else delivered for FREE for a year.  We were NEVER told about any kind of Rewards Clud and didn't realize we were charged for this.  Absolutely not ok with how that went down. I also understand that it auto charge us each year which is absolutely NOT OK.  I have called to have it cancelled for any year past this one.

Also my husband called a few weeks ago to order another piece to add to our sectional couch, and he was told that was not possible.  She also said she would look into as that was the third time that day she had been told the same scenario by a customer and it was not true.  However, she was going to look into and call him back.  Crickets....never heard back.

I had to call last night to schedule a manufacturer issue with our console so I checked in to make sure my husband was told correct information.  Come to find out we CAN buy the extra piece we wanted was a bit frustrating but we did place the order.

Not huge issues, but a whole lot of customer service your team can learn from and do better for the next person.

Our consultant Rosa in Ontario was great! She was energetic, she knew the products well and extremely patient throughout the process. Two of my family members have utilized her for furniture purchases in the past and she does not disappoint.< /review>

Please don’t purchase and furniture from Mathis brothers, and don’t purchase the furniture protection.
The furniture protection is a fraud they are lying to you when they say it will clever any stains or rips. The furniture is not covered, I bought the furniture protection and made a claim and got denied because they said they don’t cove any rips or stains.

I ordered a whitewash oak queen bed frame that had to be custom made and was on backorder for 2 months. We finally got it delivered around Christmas time. When the delivery men put the bed frame together, pieces were missing.We
contacted the store and we are still waiting for the support bed pieces that are missing. It's now Feb 7th, 2021 and no word from the store manager. He never returns your call, nowhere to be seen. Tina from customer service did call back once. Do I get a refund in the installation or do I need to go to small claims court. This is.rediculous. Without the middle support  piece,  the bed sinks. Where is the rest of my bed frame, custom made and ordered Sept 2020? Maybe just a full refund and have Mathis come pick it up, waste of my time. Where is the corporate number...Ken Problem was fixed, thanks for taking care of tgis issue.<//text>

Wasted a lot of time at the Ontario store with a salesman, when he stated that his manager said a coffee table set was in stock at the Indio store, then he left to go talk to his manager again, after a long wait he said there was a glitch and that they only had the coffee table, this isn't the first time this has happened, we had bought a curio from Mathis and when we went to pick it up, it wasn't there! After they had told us it was ready for pick-up, we canceled the order, It seems like Mathis never has anything in stock, won't be shopping here anymore</Text>

We ordered many items, and experiences both bad and good service, here is the bad. Upon delivery a special order was dropped and broken. Delivery could not be made and had to wait an additional 6 months(not Covid related)
We did receive 10% off. We ordered custom chairs with a designer and the completely missed my pattern selection by giving me all white instead of a blue hexagon pattern. We were promised 10% off and never received. We were called to pick up our chairs 6 months later and when we got there they took our chairs and said they could not give us our new ones because the cashier had gone home. They new we were driving from far away to pick up our chairs. That was a nightmare! The GM was left several messages and emails to contact us and he never would. It was hard to get questions answered when it came to rewards and status of our order. In the other hand they have the best luxury brands for the best price. You can order from other designers catalogs. I love all the pieces we purchased. If we ever go back I know I need to be prepare to be disappointed with the staff but the furniture value may just be worth it.</text>

The sales representative was pleasant and stayed with us throughout our showroom visit. She didn’t push any sales and provided as many options as we requested. Only setback is we ended up ordering a dining table and chairs but need to wait until they have them in and it could take months.<//text>

< Review>
Overbooked. Liars. Cheaters.
I ordered the furniture in the Nov which they suppose to deliver in Jan. Which later their sales girl said will be delivered in Feb and now they are giving the ETA in May. And the manager is saying it's a industry trend like taking the orders when you are not able to full fill it.

I ordered the Sofa set with loveseat  they have delivered that partially and never delivered the Loveseat just giving us the false dates. Now when I asked to take this sofa back because I want the complete set they are saying that we can't take that back since it's more than a month.</Review>

Wonderful place, staff us very helpful and service is quick.
Dean was very helpful and made buying a new table simple and easy. He also gave us a simple and easy to understandable total.
He also helped us with color matching so that nothing stands out too much.</Text>

We just visited the Ontario showroom, and it was a fantastic experience. Terry helped us find the perfect couch. He was extremely knowledgeable about the couch options, and was truly a nice guy.< /review>

We were in to find a couch and Lawrence Jenkins was our salesman, he gave us plenty of space to walk around without pressuring us at all.  We had several questions and he answered every single one with excellent knowledge.  We ended up buying a beautiful couch and couldn't be happier.

Also a shout out to the delivery team what an excellent crew of 3 men they were super friendly and professional I couldn't of asked for a better delivery.

Thank you again to Lawrence and Mathis Brothers for an excellent selection.< /Text>

< review>
Ordered a very expensive custom kitchen table. Table base had a scratch at the bottom. Okay...not the worst thing in the world. Table gets put together (connecting table top to base) and it looks good otherwise. Then I put my hand on the table top and it was super wobbly. We paid an extra 149$ for “ White Glove” service but it was far from - the workers don”t work for Mathis directly; they are subcontracted, and aren’t very versed on their furniture. After trying to tighten the screws repeatedly the table still wobbled notably. Then the workers showed me the several gaps between the base and table top preventing the screw from tightening securely and said I’d need to call a specialist from Mathis to fix it - takes a week to get one to your home. Overall, I give Mathis 1 star. The table we purchased was poorly crafted I was very disappointed given Mathis is a “higher end” furniture store. I Bought a adjustable bed base several months ago that broke within 3 months of use - so far Mathis is consistently missing the mark. If you are looking for high end, quality furniture, and willing to pay a little more - THIS IS NOT THE PLACE.< /review>

Overbooked. Liars. Cheaters.
I ordered the furniture in the Nov which they suppose to deliver in Jan. Which later their sales girl said will be delivered in Feb and now they are giving the ETA in May. And the manager is saying it's a industry trend like taking the orders when you are not able to full fill it.

I ordered the Sofa set with loveseat  they have delivered that partially and never delivered the Loveseat just giving us the false dates. Now when I asked to take this sofa back because I want the complete set they are saying that we can't take that back since it's more than a month.< /Text>

This place is HORRIBLE and customer service is NOT helpful at all!! We bought a bunk bed from them that cost Over 2,000$ And we had problem from the very beginning, and no one knew what was happening or going on so we had to go directly to the store and talk to the manager Chris), he told us the bunk bed was missing parts and that is why they wernt able to deliver on the day that was set up. Okay so fast forward a few weeks we finally got a call all the parts are ready and it will be delivered the upcoming Friday, so the delivery driver got to the house and started assembling, they then tell me they can put up the bottom bed because it’s MISSING PARTS! Even though I was told everything was ready and there. Fast forward another 2 weeks I get a call they are ready to deliver the parts that were needed for the bottom bed, so that was scheduled for the upcoming Friday and they come and AGAIN tell me the parts are still missing!! Now it’s been over 3 months and Still HAVENT heard anything about what’s going on. This is ridiculous and the customer service sucks I wouldn’t recommend going to Mathis brothers and this seems to be a common problem with Mathis brothers!!</Text>

We bought a  dining room set from Mathis Brothers in December 2018.  we bought the protection plan and needed it when we accidentally put a tear in one of the seats they could not replace the seat so we went to look for a replacement set. we found one for $50 cheaper than the one we bought but it ended up costing us $197.77 in a new plan and delivery I feel for good customer service that we should not have been charged  for the delivery but they would not do that I don’t plan on shopping in Mathis Brothers ever again<//review>

SO I go RENT A UHUAL for $150 and I go and the worker tells me they’re closed for pick up!!! Now we wasted $150 and now have to do it again on Thursday. Unbelievable<//review>

This place is HORRIBLE and customer service is NOT helpful at all!! We bought a bunk bed from them that cost Over 2,000$ And we had problem from the very beginning, and no one knew what was happening or going on so we had to go directly to the store and talk to the manager Chris), he told us the bunk bed was missing parts and that is why they wernt able to deliver on the day that was set up. Okay so fast forward a few weeks we finally got a call all the parts are ready and it will be delivered the upcoming Friday, so the delivery driver got to the house and started assembling, they then tell me they can put up the bottom bed because it’s MISSING PARTS! Even though I was told everything was ready and there. Fast forward another 2 weeks I get a call they are ready to deliver the parts that were needed for the bottom bed, so that was scheduled for the upcoming Friday and they come and AGAIN tell me the parts are still missing!! Now it’s been over 3 months and Still HAVENT heard anything about what’s going on. This is ridiculous and the customer service sucks I wouldn’t recommend going to Mathis brothers and this seems to be a common problem with Mathis brothers!!<//text>

<review>My Wife and I are expecting our first baby, and we where hoping to have our Couch and Ottoman delivered by now since we ordered it since March. Almost 6 Months Later and who knows how much longer, maybe next year still nothing, not even a follow up if our order is on the way. Our Sales Representative has not returned my Voice mails,  and the customer service can't give you a definitive answer. My wife is  due any day now and she has yet to enjoy the Couch we thought would help her ease the pain of caring my child, and we have to use our fold out chairs in the living room since we do not have any couch. I'm not a rich man, but i do pride my self in shopping at the best stores for my family, and this place has yet to meet my expectation. I hope anyone reading this thinks twice before they order from here, its a joke, I thought i can trust the comfort of my home with this company. I wish  the best for anyone who has had a great experience.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Purchased a coffee table for full price, only to later find out that the item had been discontinued. The sales manager offered to sell me the floor model, which had suffered significant wear and damage for a generous discount of 10%. The damage was so severe that I inherited a splinter upon physical inspection of the table leg. Needless to say, the discount was not nearly enough to cover the various damages and scratches, and the manager was unwilling to provide a fair discount, so I got a full refund.< /review>

This time I came in and knew exactly what I was looking for. I was assisted by Val Serrano who was amazing. She helped me get other items that I needed for my new bed and also searched for an item that was no longer on the floor. She went out of her way to make sure my experience was pleasant and a success. I will definitely be back the next time I am looking for furniture. Thank you Val.

I wanted to update my review because I am disappointed with the service I received after my purchase. When initially went into the store to make the purchase I was told one thing about my delivery and then a week later I was told something different. I was willing to compromise and was told by my sales woman to follow up with her when I knew what a good day was to have my items delivered. I never heard back from her. Because of this I chose to cancel my order. I will no longer be doing business with Mathis Brothers. I will find the items that I wanted at another furniture store.< /Text><userid>102389416349771314703</userid><Date>1598406772302< /Date><Rating>2<//Rating><response>{'time': 1597251050894, 'text': "Thank you for the review, Mazha!

<Text>I purchased a leather couch, chair, and ottoman from Mathis Bros (MB) 10/20/19. My story: I called immediately to advise the leather was not seamed straight and Mercedes in service said NO REFUNDS!
in January 2020, the leather began to stretch, the chair was sinking in the rear, and the filling looked like an old comforter when it was washed the inside is lumpy. Whenever people sit on the couch it leaves a rear print I have been calling MB for months, and have spoken to Mercedes, and several people in service, and was promised a call back by Jennifer which I never received nor received a voicemail. Finally on 8/24 a company came out to look at the furniture and sent the report to Mathis Bros I was advised. I have called MB twice and keep getting a run-around by Lisa, I call again 8/26 and spoke  to Maria to get another run-around. I asked for the store managers name and Maria said Fred and couldn't disclose the last name. Maria is typing away however offers no viable assistance. MATHIS BROS I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE FOR MONTHS. The customer service at the Ontario store is quite bad. There are lemon laws in the State of CA..< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<review>Orie Innabi was the first salesperson to greet me after I walked through the door. Her demeanor was very pleasant n friendly. I explained to her what I was looking for n we walked to the bedroom section. I was impressed with her knowledge n the selection available. We also looked at mattresses n I told her that I wanted to go home n think it over n then come back. She was very agreeable with this n gave me her business card. When I came back in this morning, she was just as personable n I felt very relaxed n not pressured in any way. I told her which bed n mattress I wanted n that I also wanted a dresser n nightstand. She showed me the available options based on my bed choice, n I am completely satisfied with the choices I made. I have never experienced a salesperson such as Orie n I would highly recommend her assistance to anyone when visiting Matthis Bros. Thank you so much for your wonderful pricing n friendliness by everyone that we came in contact with. I must say that Chris, one of the managers, was just as friendly, polite n warm as Orie. I will be recommending your establishment to all of my family members n friends. Thank you once again!</review>< response>

Mathis Brothers made it happen for me - great prices and outstanding service! I especially love the fact that I received free delivery, and I received it only a few days later. Every company should offer that. I thank Ashley Fomby for handling my purchase with great knowledge and professionalism. She was patient with me and detailed all of my options, so when I finally made a decision, I knew that it was the right one. I love my new bed and mattress!

Highly satisfied customer!

<Review>Well I was going to spend almost $6000 and the person helping me was trying BUT his manager “Patric” didn’t want to help us with a slightly discount being that the protection plan was going to be almost $600 and the delivery was going to be $300 To me it was very very UNFAIR. So I decided NOT to shop here at all. Shop in the past and was helped with a Discount not sure what happened to this Store now 👎 🤔< /Review>< UserId.>

We finally found a couch that we liked and he told us the pros and cons, and just made sure that we were happy. All in all, my experience was amazing. I had never been there before so I didn't know what to expect, but this was a wonderful experience. And if there was something that we didn't want, he would just say "Okay," and not keep pushing us like in car dealerships.</Review><user_name>Alohomora</user_name><Response>{'time': 1590955929077, 'text': "Thank you for the review!

No surprise that still now, months later we are still waiting for the sofa to arrive. people need to know ahead of time how long things will take and not be falsely promised non existent delivery dates. oh and to top things off, the wrong size bed rails as box spring were delivered. save your time , effort and sanity and shop somewhere else.

Update
The rest of my furniture has yet to arrive. Getting the run around with customer service, sales. No one is willing to take back wrong size bed rails and box spring. This is customer service at its worst.

final update:
took a total of 3 months of incessant calling, inquiring and harrassing to obtain my items. one of the worst buying experiences.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Let me try to prioritize this review…

The sales associate I dealt with was one of the best I’ve ever encountered. Her level of attentiveness, attention to detail, Ability to understand and assess my needs were top level. I can be critical because I working at highly competitive sales environment, you’re lucky to have her.

Every person we engaged with was high-quality, high-value, very engaging, right attitude and right energy. That is by no chance, that’s a culture you are creating and you should be rewarded for that.

The building, the products, the story and the brand that you promote, is tight, It’s really admirable. I mean, it’s not everybody’s thing, but it is meeting the widest audience at the right price point and at the right service level. Awesome!

From the street to the door, the education and awareness campaigns are amazing, parking is easy, Entry into the building, like the security and assuring everybody’s health and safety is paramount was done very well. It’s done both tactfully and seriously, I really value that.

In summary, I went there because of the brand, I really had very little intention of committing… But Nicole, who I was able to engage with, really understands the intricacies and complexity of selling, she is what made the sale. She found a way to disarm the things I needed, lean into the process of learning my space and needs, and understood how to communicate and find the things I needed but didn’t quite understand that I wanted.</review>

We had been looking for a recliner sofa and recliner chair for our family room. We are very happy with salesperson Kat who took the time to help us with our needs vs their inventory. Thank you to Kat for finding the sofa and chair we wanted.<//Review>

<rating>2<//rating><Text>The store took great COVID precautions before they would let us in; temperature check, answer questions about health, and put a wrist band on so they knew we had been screened but the sales person who followed us around was right on top of us, even if we backed off, he would slow down or walk faster to be back on top of us. He did not know what social distancing was and appeared to have never heard of 6 feet. My husband was trying to see how a desk worked and was bending over the top and he was right over the top of him. We were very uncomfortable.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Bought a $4000 sectional started falling apart after 1 year. Bought the extended warranty and it was no help multiple repairs and know I have 3 out of the four recliners not working. And I have to wait 7 months for parts. And they refuse to replace them even thought they have tried to fix four times. Horrible customer service. People are nice but can't do anything to help you.</Review>

<Review>We placed an order with Mathis for a new couch and ottoman. As far as the sales end everything went well. The issues came when our order was ready to ship. We received a call from their delivery driver stating our order was incorrect that the couch did not match in color. When our sectional arrived it was two completely different colors and our ottoman was also incorrect. They allowed us to keep the incorrect furniture, which was nice, but we still have yet to receive the correct order after more than a week. They called us recently and told us they located our correct order and scheduled the delivery. When the driver arrived they were only scheduled for a pick up and our correct order was not on the truck. They were only trying to pick up the incorrect order. All we want is our correct order.<//Review><response>{'time': 1593447226126, 'text': 'Hello Chad, I am sorry to hear about all the miscommunication and difficulty that you have had in getting the correct furniture delivered.

I have a fantastic experience with Mathis Brothers.  As a gift may parents are buying my daughter a new bed for Christmas.  We decided a full extra long would be best for her size and the size of her room.  She's 12 and 5'6 1/2.  Unfortunately, this is not a very common size and we've had serious trouble finding any bed frames for a pre-teen a true full extra long.  We called down to Mathis Brothers to see if they offer anything of the sorts and Val Serrano was the lovely saleswoman would took our call.  Val was able to give us some ideas and a direction to start.  My daughter was interested in one of the options so we made an appointment to check it out in person.  Having never been to Mathis Brothers, I was shocked how big it was. It was like Disneyland for adults.  Temperature checks were taken at the door as well as a sanitation station to use before entering and we were given wristbands to verify we were checked.  Val met us and showed us our options.  Val was so patient, my daughter wasn't in love with what we chose over text so she showed us other options for several hours.  Once we found the perfect bed, Val explained which pieces we could used to create what we needed.  We bought the full size head and foot board and queen rails for the sides. After months of trying to figure this out with endless frustration, Val made it look effortless.  We ended up buying the whole bedroom set and she gave us ideas on finding a full extra long mattress.  Unfortunately due to covid my daughters furniture won't be available for pick up until end of December but I'm still in contact with Val as she continues to update us about our furniture status.  I was so impressed with both the amount of furniture options we had to choose from and Val's knowledge and experience in the furniture world.  I highly recommend Mathis brothers and Val to all our family and friends!<//Text>

<user_name>Lydia Hallsworth<//user_name><Date>1597698721780<//Date><Rate>2<//Rate><Review>Unfortunately it took 53 minutes to complete an exchange of a previously purchased mattress cover. I arrived at 11:00 a.m. and was immediately checked for my temperature and given a green wrist band to wear. I was then referred to the customer service area here I had to drive my car to for further assistance. Once I explained my request for an exchange to the customer service assistant I had to wait about 40 minutes outside in 95° temperature only to be told I had to return to the main entrance and speak with the credit cashiers to prove that my bill was paid in full. I was also told by the customer service assistant that she tried calling the credit cashiers but received  no answer on the phone. So I drove back to the Mathis Brothers main entrance to clear up this issue with the credit cashiers even though  my original paperwork showed it was paid in full. After returning to the main entrance and clearing up this issue with the credit cashier I again drove back to the customer service assistant area to finally pick up my exchange.
I understand covid-19 has affected all areas of efficiency and can only hope that time frames of customer service can be improved.</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1597700113766, 'text': 'Lydia, We apologize about the issues you had with your exchange.

You wrote a review for Mathis Brothers Furniture	12 minutes ago
1.0 star rating12/18/2020
Covid has really shown Mathis Brothers true colors. My husband and I had a the Furniture Protection plan on a couch, which we used because our dog had an accident. They were unable to repair it and issued us a store credit. We accepted this and went to the store within in the next couple of weeks to pick out a new couch. Our couch was a custom Benjamin couch and we loved it. When we went to pick out a new couch, they no longer had that maker of the couch anymore. They have these much cheaper looking couches, and we tried on two different visits, for almost 5 hours to find a replacement couch. Which we could not. We at one point ran into a Sale rep, named Lori Villas, who said we didn't need to use the store credit for the same item. We could use it on ANY thing. We asked multiple times if we needed to return the couch, since we were NOT getting a replacement for the couch. She answered each time. NO, you do not need to return the couch, the store credit is like cash, you can apply it to your purchase. Which we did. We ordered another bedroom set to replace the current one we have, and we were going to move the other one downstairs. We waited about 16 weeks for our items, and were setting up a delivery date and finalizing payment. The cashier told me they couldn't do store credit, that it would have to be a refund onto my credit card. My balance was at $0, so they said MYSynchrony would issue a check due to the negative balance. They had also asked if I would be returning anything and I told them no, because we were not exchanging a couch for a couch.

Long story short. Mathis brothers REFUSED to give us our store credit unless we returned the couch (that my husband and I had ended up having repaired because their Furniture Plan couldn't).  I called Customer Service first, and Paige was very rude, and even said LOL, mocking me. I spoke to Lori, our Sale Rep, she could care less. The transaction was done and her commission was made. I spoke to the sales Manager, Ashley, and she was just was rude. The finally straw was when I spoke to the Store Manager, Fred. He is a man of excuses. He did nothing to satisfy a long time customer, he was just as rude as everyone else I spoke to, and I can see who is setting the example for Customer Service at the Ontario location. He refused to do anything to help, except extend our store credit and even said he didn't have time for our conversation and hung up on me. There was no accountability for what I was told by the multiple other people before this.  The FPP company said it was up to the discretion of Mathis, on how they wanted to proceed. I honestly think Mathis brothers isn't honoring their warranty, and they are upset at FFP for issuing a store credit.

If you are choosing to shop here be aware of how you will be treated and talked to after you purchase from them. They were nice in the beginning and lie to get the sale. So disappointed in them as a whole, and they did a great job of ruining my holiday.

Side note: Delivery people were rude, didn't wear shoe coverings and damaged one of my items.<//text>

Went to Mathis bros. after 7 months of looking for a couch. Walked right in to the clearance section and there it was the perfect couch... The associate was very pleasent and helpful...Was a little upset that the delivery fees were so much. My husband opted to pick it up himself. Other than that all wS good.< /review>

We purchased a bedroom set which we really like.  We were NEVER told that part of it would be delivered 2 months later.  First we were told everything would be delivered and then the day of the delivery the salesman sent a text message saying part of it would be delivered a week later.  So at the end of that week the salesman stuck to his story but said it would be delivered in the next week.  I called the store to find out that Now it’s another month out.  I get things are slower because of Covid but you need to tell your clients up front what is going on.</Text>

A year ago bought a recliner sofa. Came with damaged USB port. Plus the  leather showed too many wrinkles in reclined position. They sent some one to check who agreed with the issue but nothing has been done..
They always try to sale extra warranty which is just waste of money.<//review>

Really large warehouse with lots of furniture to see.  I liked how you can visit their cafe.  I was hoping for more high end brands and furniture.< /Review>

This is my first experience buying at Mathis Brothers in Ontario.  I can't say enough about there Customer Service. They really go above and beyond to make their Customers happy with there purchase.  Don't be afraid to shop there during Cocid-19.  They are following all the CDC and Riverside County guide lines.</text>

Gigantic store with name-brand merchandise spanning medium to higher-end price points. They even have their own cafe. I was impressed with their selection of name brands. You won't find low quality junk like they have at Bob's, Mor, and similar discount stores. They also offer design services. Shopped for a sofa and loveseat, which were priced about 10% lower than other stores for the same item. Salespeople are friendly but will keep asking if you have questions if you try to look around on your own. Four stars since I don't know what their service is like after a sale, buy definitely worth a look.<//Text>

We visited Mathis Brothers on Saturday - they are enforcing the CDC guidelines which was appreciated!
Our sales associate was Jasmine and she was excellent; she was knowledgable, kind and personable. My husband and I usually avoid furniture stores and shop online, as we usually feel like we get stalked. This was a positive, relaxed experience and got just what we wanted and more!</text>

<review>I bought my sectional, dining, and Buffet from Mathis Brothers Furniture. It was not only the fastest but most seamless process with my amazing representative Andrea and my furniture was delivered to my front door. I’ll always buy everything I need from this organization and Mathis Brothers should be proud of the business they’re running! Thank you again Mathis Brothers! Everyone was so nice and everyone followed up with me after the point of sale! Incredible!<//review>< rating>

Katie,
Did an awesome job for us. She went above and beyond, she did everything we could ask for and then some. We will continue to use Matthias Brothers for all of our home furnishings and we will always try and work with Katie.
Thank You for a wonderful experience

<Review>Although some of the associates walked right past me several times...there were several that made a point to ask me if I needed any help or had questions. This morning I returned to the store to purchase furniture...after browsing over the weekend...and I was so impressed. Not only is the showroom beautiful and well put together...there are many options to fit every budget. The only thing I was disappointed about... is the expensive delivery fee and many items being out of stock. But within an hour I made a great purchase that I was delighted with. Thank you very much Mario and Genesis for your patience, professionalism, and excellent service!!❤🤗</Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1593529511955, 'text': 'We are excited to read you had a great overall experience shopping with us!

<review>We went to Mathis Brothers kind of on a whim and found just what we were looking for in a dining room set. The salesman was helpful and courteous, and arranged for delivery exactly when we wanted it. The delivery people were in contact to give us updates on when they expected to arrive, were efficient and pleasant, and cleaned up all the packing materials once they made sure everything was to our satisfaction.  Overall, we had a great experience.< /review>< username>

Our Sales Associate, Matthew Anderson, went the extra mile to make sure we were getting the right product. Called him a few times and he always answered immediately and followed up with answers.  We ordered our sofa right before Covid19 lock-down. It was suppose to take 4 to 6 weeks for delivery.  Although it took nearly 5 months, it was worth the wait.  Whenever we called on the status, the service staff was polite and apologetic for the delay, even though their hands were tied. The delivery was flawless; the reminder, check-in, timing and set-up.  We would definitely purchase furniture from Mathis Brothers again.< /text>

< review>
SSpent $15,000 on Furniture at Mathis for our new home. Dining room set, and 2 sets of sofas for 2 rooms. Great customer service until we placed our last order which happened to be a special order.  We placed a special order for a sofa sectional on July 4th weekend. Rubin our sales man told us 3 months for delivery. Within a week of the purchase we determined that the sofas were too bulky for the room and I called Rubin after less than a week from the purchase to change the order to smaller sofas and he refused stating that the order was already in fabrication.  Seriously, it takes 3 months to make it and couldn't change it after less than a week. Well, the Sofas were delivered 2 days ago, and good enough, they were so bulky for our small family room.  What an eye sore.  In the showroom they looked so good, as the show room is so huge, we couldn't tell.  I just called Rubin again, pleading with him to take it back with penalties, restocking fees, 10-20% fee, etc, etc... whatever it takes to have Mathis take them back.  He said no because it's a special order.  Now we are stuck with a $2,800 eye sore for many years.  Very sad.
I came to find out that this place is not about customer satisfaction, they simply don't care. They are too big to find someone to talk to who would care or to give you any personalized service if you have an issue. Your sales man is your only contact, and they are already trained on what to say: a quick NO. They are all over you until you complete the sale, then they leave you hanging.  Rubin kept texting me the contract saying look you signed it, it says here non-refundable, seriously Mathis? this is how you treat customers who came to you with their hard earned cash at challenging times like this.  You have a huge clearance room for discounted furniture, you cannot charge me a return penalty fee and put it in that showroom, to resolve a customer issue?  This issue might not mean much to you, but to me and my family, a purchase like this is a really big deal.
So Customers be ware and be 100 percent sure before you buy here, they have great furniture but their return policy is extremely stringent, they will not bend, they will enforce every word on that contract once you sign it,  and to me that's very prohibitive, we are human, who doesn't make mistakes. Live and learn.</review>

<Text>Wish I could give a zero star rating.  The sales department to us my daughters bed would be delivered in 4 weeks. We painted her room and called on week 3 for the status of the bed. Sales department said it was going to be delivered before week 4 on that Friday.  So Monday is here and no bed. I called Monday 2.25.2019. They said the bed was in. They needed to process it and we should be getting a call Tuesday or Wednesday for possible Friday delivery.  Its Saturday 3.2.2019. That last week I removed my daughter bed. For a week she has been sleeping on the floor. I have never had this issue with Jerome's or living spaces. We contacted the sales guy. He hasn't been at work for 2 weeks. Mathis brothers keeps transferring us to the sales guy that can't even access the system. I spoke to a manager and they dont have answers.<//Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJ5crrBTlt2GJA1ox85Uhz58Q_NOecIaJlWx1G=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< Resp>

First of all I wanna say that we had a wonderful experience with our sales representative Erica McManis ...she was fantastic. It went downhill as we went to pick up our furniture out in the warehouse. The customer service has been terrible at mathis. We waited two hours outside to pick up one sofa that we could see inside the door of the warehouse. I have tried in vain for two weeks to contact someone in customer service to answer my questions and have been passed around from person to person with no call back. People on the phone have been rude, have not apologized for the situation, and have not called back when they have said that they would. We have ordered four pieces of furniture in two months from your store and this is how you treat customers? We were so happy withOur sales person however the customer service department has ruin the experience for us, and we would never purchase furniture there again. We do not look forward to coming out there to pick up the remaining furniture that we have on order.<//Text>

<text>Mathis Brothers has a multitude of serious operational, customer service, and ethical issues.  After shopping around for a specific recliner with a firm delivery date due to an upcoming surgery (recliner important to recovery), the sales associate assured me that they had a chair for me and would deliver well in advance of my surgery.  We had two delivery dates scheduled then cancelled at the last minute.  The reason was that the chair to be delivered was missing a motor and such.  They tried twice to deliver the same bad chair.  Various associates said they'd look into things and never called me back.  I learned that my name is now on a chair to be delivered in late September which was never part of our agreement.  My order has since been cancelled and I'm getting a refund.  I just wish that someone would have been honest with me from the start.  I won't be trusting this company in the future for any business.<//text><user_id>106132141847754124342</user_id>< time>

< Review>
The sales associate, Lawrence Jenkins from the Ontario location was outstanding! Five stars for Lawrence. He was attentive, answered all our questions and very helpful.

However the reason for the 3 star rating is based on the customer pick-up service. We arranged to pick up the furniture directly from the store vs delivery service, after purchasing the furniture a month beforehand.

I even called the day of pick up to verify the furniture was available & ready for pickup, which it was. My husband had to wait almost 3 hours for the furniture to be retrieved and brought out. It was slow when he got there and other customers arrived after him and left before he got his furniture. It was by far the worst customer service pick up ever experienced. In fact, no one even bothered to provide a status report until about 30 minutes before they finally brought the furniture out.  Terrible, terrible customer service for picking up items. Very disappointed in Mathis Brothers.< /Review>

< review>
The procedure for  going to Mathis Bros to spend several thousand  on new furniture. Stand in line for 10 minutes, proceed in to be interrogated  about your health after you have passed the temperature  check. Proceed on to hand sanitation and braclet to wear. Hubby and I proceed into store only to be loudly yelled at by employee for not having mask entirely covering the nose area. Hubby just had skin cancer surgery so wearing things tight on his nose is painful.  I suffer from anxiety from wearing these masks over my nose  I feel like I cannot breath properly, my heart races and I feel anxious.  This employees yelled for the whole  store to hear that this is private property and if you cant obey  all our rules than you need to leave. We had our masks on. We passed the temp check and sanitized but were treated so horrible for just wanting the mask below our nostrils.. I have never been so mortified in  my whole life to be treated like that. We left never to return! I hope you go out of business!!!< /review>

We were looking for a small swivel chair we had seen before in showroom.  Price was under $300.   While the sales person was pleasant she was zooming through showroom showing us chairs and when we chose one zoomed us through checkout. It was a bit overwhelming and we felt our small purchase was something she wanted to get done with and on to next customer.  We wanted the material treated as we have 2 dogs.  She said it would be $36. So we were “great.”  Come to find out from loading guy chairs come pretreated. What she charged us $36 for was a do it yourself cleaning kit.  We would not have purchased that if she had taken time to explain this.  Although this experience was not our best we have dealt with another sales person who was wonderful and would definitely ask for Walter next time.< /text>

The store is massive and there is a huge inventory to chose from! Jake walked with me throughout the store showing me everything that met the description of what I was looking for. He even took me to the warehouse that housed all the clearance items. He was incredibly knowledgeable and he never made me feel pressured to buy a thing. It was a holiday weekend and we had an issue with our credit card. Jake worked with his manager to ensure our order was held until the fraud alert was lifted from our card. The delivery was perfect as well. The gentlemen that delivered our items were on time and very friendly. Top notch service from start to finish! Its definitely worth the drive to Ontario and we will be going back again for sure!</review>

I recently went to Mathis Brothers for a new bed frame and mattress. I needed a full size because of the size of the room. One employee was very helpful, friendly and kind. As soon as I got to the mattress and bedroom sets a different employee took over and was not as nice. I told him I needed a full size bed for myself a 26 year old woman standing in front of him. He took me to the children's section (which I understand is where most fulls are located) and proceeded to run though the department and point out several child-like bed sets with a laugh, he then stopped and pointed to a princess style bed and said, you'll like this one it's perfect for you with a laugh. I understand that many full sized beds are located in the children's section, however, please train your employees to not patronize your customers. I did end up buying a mattress (from a different employee) from here but I didn't want to purchase a bedroom set after being laughed at.< /Review>

<time>1580232388699<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Went in yesterday and was greeted by Oscar. Oscar was a awesome salesperson, Right from the beginning you told us if you guys have any questions just let me know I'm going to hang on hang back and I really appreciate that. I have been looking for a sofa for a little while now and every store I had gone to before Mathis Brothers the sales representative just followed us and made us feel uncomfortable and I didn't really want to try out any of the sofa. When we came to Mathis Brothers it was the total opposite Oscar was the sales representative that I wanted he let me have my space but was there to answer any questions. Ended up buying a nice couch and instead of recliners Oscar has truly earned my business and anything else that I need I will be coming back just because of Oscar<//text>< pics>

<Text>Yesterday I went to your Mathis Brothers location in Ontario since now am in the process of moving to this location just waiting for my house to be done building. Likewise, being said am in the process of buying new furnitures for my new house all I need is a complete set for my great/formal living room. Upon entering was greeted by your staff the usual health protocol and assigned to Tony that was introduced as being the top salesman by the manager. After, a couple of conversation, my sister indicated that we want an L shaped living set  with the range of 2 to 3 thousand range. Tony showed us 2 or 3 sets of furniture, then all of sudden he said he has customer to attend to and promised to be back which he never did. Anyway, since we are already there our family decided to explore the whole store. Then, a lady named Emma approached us and ask if we need help to make the long short, we just went to whoever is willing to assist us, several  showing from her, to my amazement, same demeanor seems very distracted
Furthermore, I was disturbed because I work with the company that is very customer focus finally I said and asked are you waiting for someone cuz I could see she is not customer focus and she keeps on looking the other way as if she not interested. Am sure you have heard the words Customer Perception. Then after she realized that we are buying customers she has changed her demeanor. I could have walked out and buy somewhere else however, I am just time challenged I need all furnitures by the time we moved in to our new house
We end up spending almost 5 k after everything said and done and paid in cash. Not that much being in customer interface business myself, Tony lost some commission pay out and although Emma gained some sales however, she lost customer referrals and company's referrals.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The selection and quality at Mathis Brothers is, in our opinion, the finest in the Inland Empire.  The delivery service was great, too! All our items came wrapped and in perfect condition.

<Review>I am so glad you asked me to rate your service. I would have given 5 stars. The salesman was attentive to my questions and had good product knowledge. But when I went to pick up my chair,  myself and another customer that was looking at the same chairs as I, were the only two customers waiting at the warehouse door. The warehouse was serving him as I arrived. They finished with him shortly after I arrived. Then I was the only vehicle waiting to pick up. The warehouse guys asked for my slip, I provided it to him. He apparently went to go pick up my order. Approximately 10 minutes later another truck pulls up. The customer gets out of his truck and walks back into the store, which was the opposite direction of the warehouse. A while later, he comes back and provides the warehouse guy with his slip. This was the same warehouse guy that took my slip. A little while later, the warehouse guy comes out with his mattress and I'm still waiting for my chair. So I asked him, how did this guy pull up after me and leave before me. Sorry but one star is all you get for that nonsense. I know you can do better, you earned this rating and it may be too high.< /Review><response>{'time': 1582813810211, 'text': "Al, We're glad to hear that you had a positive experience with your sales person, but we're disappointed to hear you had a negative experience with our warehouse team.

< Review>
End-to-end experience was a little odd.  My sale representative was fine, no issues.  However, to complete the sale, I needed to receive a call from an out-of-state Mathis Brothers associate who completed my transaction.  Although my sales person informed me this is the process, I find it odd, boarding on dehumanizing the entire transaction.  I do not, will not recommend Mathis Brothers specifically because of this part of my transaction.</Review>

<review>Ordered furniture on March 4 and still have not received it. Understand Covid19 excuse but not one person in your company has kept us updated and when we call about it they can give us no idea when it will arrive. Hard to believe that this item can’t be tracked. Of course our payments have started so I understand there is not a lot of concern.< /review></record>

Bought a bedroom set CASH and the sales guy who said he was a Manager ripped me off. He said he would give me a delivery discount because I live in the area but, after I got home and checked my receipt, he charged me $69.00 for some lame discount reward membership. It would have been nice if he would have told me but he conveniently kept that part out. I'm never buying anything from them again. I'm NEVER BUYING FROM THERE AGAIN! I'M GOING TO JEROME'S FURNITURE NEXT TIME.< /Text>

BEWARE!!! MATTHIS BROTHERS IN ONTARIO, CA  DO NOT HONOR THIER PRICE GUARANTEE after in writing they approved that the criteria was met. They said they will sell me at the lower price (after I had to tell them to honor price match GUARANTEE) but they would not give me double the difference as written in thier policy. I left a message for director of customer relations Rick to return my call let's see if he will honor and. Fix the issue.  I'm leary because because the BBB shows them having ALOT of complaints and lots still unresolved.  JC PENNY AND MACY'S BOTH have LOWER PRICES on same exact items and Jimmy abruptly stopped the process of communication as  i was ordering over the
Phone and communicating through text when i said i want them to honor the written policy and give me the difference. Very unprofessional and very sketchy.  Save yourself from the stress and headache.< /Text>

Worst experience ever! See letter to general manager
Fred,

My name is Chris . My wife and I bought a pair of bunk beds for our children and a dresser 3 weeks ago. We only purchased these items from Mathis Brothers as we were told they were both available in your inventory and all other furniture stores had a back order of roughly two weeks due to Covid. One bunk bed for my daughter went in with no problems although the very tired and unmasked delivery men thought for the first couple hours they had lost the ladder and continued to ask us for beverages. We determined the the 2nd bunk bed was missing the slats and were unable to assemble the bed.

When we contacted the store they apologized for the oversight and told us to come down the next day to pick up the slats. When my mother in law got there she was told to go to 3 different departments within the store and then was given slats to a king size bed not the full size required for the bed.

We waited another week for Mathis Brothers to find the additional set and we were invited to drive to your distribution center again only to find out the slats once again did not fit the bed. This time around we found out this was due to the bed being built incorrectly.

Today we were supposed to have a new bed delivered between 2-4 PM so I took the afternoon off work to make sure this was done correctly and my 4 year old son would have a bed to sleep in tonight. We were told by your drivers when they showed up they did not have the bed in the truck. I called your office who assured me they did but now the driver was too far to return and the next delivery would be Friday. After reluctantly agreeing to the delivery I received a message from your corporate office stating this bed would be out of stock until September.

I was given your name is the general manager for Mathis Brothers. I would like to know if this is how you do business and what the proper resolution should be here for the month long inconvenience?<//review>

<review>Our experience was ok, the store has plenty of selections for everyone. A clean store that’s  well kept up. However, I would say the sales people are a little too attentive and pushy when they feel you’re going to leave without purchasing (commission based sales probably).

Also, we had purchased a bedroom set that is great but the kitchen table set was terrible. After week one the table top veneer was wearing down so easily. Sliding plates, pizza boxes, etc  across the table would easily scratch off the side ends of the Fake wood panels. Even as a distressed type table you could easily tell these were scratches were there. And six months later the cushions on all the chairs wore down and you could feel the wood seat frame while sitting which wasn’t very long because it hurt.</review>< response>

<review>My wife & I recently purchased a home and need furniture.  Due to COVID-19 pandemic, all furniture stores have a limited stock or are on back order. We were hoping that the furniture we picked would be available at Mathis because we didn’t want to go to different furniture stores. We’ve always had a great experience at Mathis so this was our first stop. Upon entering Mathis, we were greeted by Andrea Mendes, who assisted us with our furniture picks. We informed her of what we needed & the budget we had. We knew the size & type of bed we wanted & luckily it’s in stock. We also picked a few additional items to go with our bedroom set. Unfortunately, our girls bedroom set is on back order & we hope it will arrive next month. The mattresses we chose is also in stock. Thank goodness! Next, we picked a sectional for our family room & a couch & two chairs for our living room. Luckily it’s in stock too. Ms. Mendes is totally sweet & helpful because she was able to help us match our furniture & give suggestions as to what will look nice. She was never pushy & she even gave my wife her cell number if she wanted her guidance for decorating our home. We had a great experience at Mathis! Ms. Mendes is extremely professional, courteous, helpful, insightful, & just an awesome person who assisted us. We’re extremely happy & satisfied with our purchases. Hopefully we’ll receive all purchases soon. However, we do understand that a lot of things will be on back order.
Another thanks goes out to Ms. Iaunna, the young lady who assisted us with our payment. She has excellent customer service skills. She greeted us with a smile & asked how our day was going. Thank you for that. We joked around with her & she has a lovely demeanor. My wife & I told her we’d give her a review too. Ms. Iaunna was very sweet, professional, positive, & personable. Overall, our experience at Mathis has been great & that’s why we continue to go back to purchase items. The people who assisted us have been awesome. Thank you Ms. Mendes for all your help & suggestions. Thank you Iaunna for your great attitude.</review>< Pictures>

<review>I have purchased from several  furniture stores over the years for example Living Spaces and Jerome’s  and Mathis brothers - Mathis Brothers far exceeds any service I’ve gotten furniture shopping., Patrick and Mario in Ontario provided superior personal service. Patrick went so far as during Covid when the store was closed to sent me pics of different sofas and answered all my questions. I’ve never experienced such personal service. I will never shop anywhere else for furniture other than Mathis Brothers again!</review></record></dataset><record>

Love this store! All of the sales people are friendly and very helpful. We were greeted by Matthew as soon as we entered the store. He helped us get the sofa we wanted even though it was not in stock in that store.  The sofa was delivered within 2-3 weeks of ordering it from the Oklahoma store, and brought in by 3 very professional guys who were pleasant and very careful.  Thank you Mathis Brothers.</Review>

<text>I ordered a bedroom set. The sales person checked and confirmed it was in stock and informed me that it was reserved for me so we scheduled the delivery. I received a call 2 days before my delivery and was told I would only be receiving a night stand. When I questioned it, I was told, everything else is on back order. So, I called the next day and spoke to customer service who confirmed, I would only be receiving a nightstand and the rest of my order would not be available until June. so the day of the nightstand delivery, I get a knock on my door and was told my entire order was being delivered! Of course, my bedroom was not ready, I hadn't cleared anything out. So I had them put everything in the garage. When I spoke to customer service they didn't really have an answer as to why the miscommunication. All they could do was reschedule my service appointment for the set up of my new furniture. Based on this experience all I could say is beware, you may or may not receive what was promised.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131</gmap_id><time>1588882352479< /time>< Rating>

<review>Love this store and shop there often.
i googled the store hours that were listed and claimed to have been updated 4 days ago and the store hours stated they closed at 9pm. I understand the whole deal with COVID but you really should list it on your website and not just at your front door. There a quite a few people  who came out and were very disappointed along with myself. Some traveled as far as Glendale and West Covina. Very unprofessional and quite inconvenienced. Mathis Brothers is a big enough company to have the ability to update the changing hours. Don't take your customers for granted. Not cool!< /review><Name>Girl Butterfly</Name>< Rating>

Mathis Brothers is a great place to shop for furniture.  There are so many choices and price ranges that anyone should find what they are looking for.  I’ve purchased different items in the past and have never been let down.  The prices are fair, items in stock, and delivery is quick.  I would recommend Mathis Brothers to anyone looking for fine furniture or accessories for the home.< /Text>

Deceitful, if not false advertising. Mathis Brothers states "Buy today, take home tomorrow", a lie that even their sales staff admit to. What they sell on the showroom floor is not only not in stock, but filling the order will take upwards of six months. We found the exact same products at better prices at their competitors (Jeromes) and had the purchase within a week. Rit, your grandfather would be very disappointed. He didn't conduct business this way. Your sales staff are using 'bait and switch' tactics.< /Text>

We're loved the service and the few beautiful American made pieces of furniture there is.  3 stars because to much furniture made in China. China does not buy from America, but we make them rich & their food is not inspected before it's sent to America.  My alternate neighbors were born & raised in China and they all warned me to not buy food or other things from their home country. I am very careful now. American made is more expensive but worth saving up for.<//Text>

Horrible Customer Service for PU!  The problem, they DON'T Care.   People are flocking into Mathis Brothers updating their homes during this time and want the furniture so to Mathis Brothers Customer Service isn't necessary.   The Store Manager said "So Sorry", 6 times during one incident.  How is this Customer Service?   Due to COVID the cashiers area is smaller, the weight times are horrible and the worse is when a sales associate walks up to the cashier while helping me or any person for that matter and starts talking to the cashier and needs help AND the cashier stops helping me to help the Associate.   This transaction was a horrible experience!!<//text>

I really wish I could give them a zero star rating. I’ve waited over two months to receive my order. I called several times to check status on my order (waited over 30 minutes to speak to a representative) every single time I would get false hopes. I was advised by different representatives that I would be receiving my order within a week. Due to false information I literally got rid of my old couches to make space for my new ones. I was without couches for over two months. I spoke to a manager that was unable to assist me!! Really?  Poor customer service. I would never mislead people to make a purchase. Horrible experience!! I wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone. This was my first & last time purchasing from them. You guys SUCK!!< /Text>

I would highly recommend going to Mathis Brothers in Ontario. Really enjoyed my experience there and was never hassled by a sales associate which was extremely nice.  I had the please of working with Matt. He has great customer service and also allows you to shop with out being bother and checks in on you from time to time. He is extremely knowledgeable about all the product in the store and the warranties.  I will be going back there and working with Matt in the near future</Text>

< Review>
UPDATE:

This place is HORRIBLE and customer service is NOT helpful at all!! We bought a bunk bed from them that cost Over 2,000$ And we had problem from the very beginning, and no one knew what was happening or going on so we had to go directly to the store and talk to the manager Chris), he told us the bunk bed was missing parts and that is why they wernt able to deliver on the day that was set up. Okay so fast forward a few weeks we finally got a call all the parts are ready and it will be delivered the upcoming Friday, so the delivery driver got to the house and started assembling, they then tell me they can put up the bottom bed because it’s MISSING PARTS! Even though I was told everything was ready and there. Fast forward another 2 weeks I get a call they are ready to deliver the parts that were needed for the bottom bed, so that was scheduled for the upcoming Friday and they come and AGAIN tell me the parts are still missing!! Now it’s been over 3 months and Still HAVENT heard anything about what’s going on. This is ridiculous and the customer service sucks I wouldn’t recommend going to Mathis brothers and this see

Bought my son a bed that was in stock, spent over 2,000 dollars On it. Delivery was set for last Friday but didn’t close escrow on our house that week. So was told they would be able to deliver it next week, now they are saying they sold it even though we already paid for it and had delivery set up for the upcoming week. They sold our  bed to some one else even though we paid full amount.</Review>

Purchased a couch and desk on a Wednesday. I was told it would be there on Saturday. Both items were clearance on I was purchasing the floor model. Saturday finally comes and the couch shows up without the desk. I’m told the desk is on backorder. Confused I ask how is it on back order when I purchased the floor model? I call in and the person puts me on hold for 10+ minutes and never checks on me. I call back again and I’m on hold for another 10+ min before I give up.

I tried calling the cell phone number the sales rep gave me to contact if I have any problems. No answer. Tried that a few times without any luck. Called back a 3rd time and request to speak with the manager. So happens the person who answers “I am involved with management” so not a manager. I explain my frustration and I’m told the soonest they could deliver is Monday.

Frustrated I agree to the deliver in 2 days. Monday comes and I ask for my delivery window only to find they meant NEXT Monday as in 10 days later. Yes I’m livid at this point. No resolution and no options. Ended up renting a truck to pick up the desk. Won’t shop here again as a result. I had spent over $8k on furniture earlier this year with them but now they’ve lost a customer for life.< /text>

<Review>Although I love this store and would purchase from here again, as well as recommend this place, this particular time was beyond disappointing. I made a purchase of a bed, 2 adjustable frames, and 2 mattresses which make up a king bed on May 21st. It took until July 13th to actually receive the second mattress, after 4 scheduled deliveries because 3 times they tried to deliver the same mismarked item. 3 times I received a call an hour before the delivery time and was told sorry we made a mistake. 7 weeks with half a bed before I actually got to sleep in it.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

Visited the showroom and was pleasantly surprised that we didn’t have a salesperson following us around.  Have us the space we like to have to see and talk about the furniture we liked or didn’t like.  Very nice and helpful.< /Text>

Had a fantastic experience using Dante as my sales associate. He gave us a chance to think of what we wanted look around and when we had any questions he was there to answer any questions we had. Helped us through getting the items we wanted to take home with us and having it delivered on time in fact ahead of time. This is the third time I purchased furniture from Mathis Brothers furniture, and I will probably buy for the fourth time soon.

We walked into your establishment looking to purchase a recliner, as we walked in a salesperson asked us did we have any questions and we said yes where are the recliners? he pointed his finger and said right there behind the escalators and walked away. We thought it was a bit odd because usually they walk you to where you need help but he didn’t. We stood in that area trying to find someone to help us with a displayed chair we wanted information on, we look around and the same guy is standing a few feet from us and my husband says excuse me, to no response. I told my husband That i would find someone else but before i could do that our salesperson Javier came around to where we were enthusiastically and gave us an awesome 5 star customer service. He helped us complete the sale with no issues and with class. Thank you Javier for your professionalism.</review>< Pics>

<text>Sorry to tell you but I have to write this review. I was told by the Sales Rep that I was going to get a 18 Month no interest and this was a huge reason why I have purchased this bunk bed for my kids but. It looks like at the end it was only for 12 months. and after paying so much already for this bunk bed over $1800 plus tax now we have to pay an extra $500 in interest. Careful and don't believe anything the sales reps tell you they are just there to sell you their stuff and make a quick buck like they did to me.

<Review>I would like to thank this guy whom I was told was a manager at Mathisbrother furniture, he is a slender white guy with bear, about  6ft in height and weighs  about  180 Ibs probably from IRISH decent, his bear looks reddish, I should have asked his name....

There was a sales man called RAFAEL  who was giving  me and my girlfriend a stressful time after we had
bought a foam mattress,box spring and the protective cloth at 753.87 dollars that supposed to come with box spring, and protective cloth, at the point of picking;
he didn't add the box spring, we went in there to ask and Rafael was giving us stories,

He wanted us to find a box spring from Craigslist, stating- that's what most people do, and it was his mistake, he was saying  sorry,  later teamed up with another  hispanic guy who claimed to be a manager just to convince us to pay, 150 bux additional to the 753.87 dollars  we had paid already, but  everything  was  not making  sense  to us so we talked to  that white guy and thank God, the white Dude came in and calmed everything down...the white guy resolved the issue in a second,  I thank him so much, some of the employees at Mathis Brothers are very sincere,< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><user_name>chris andoh<//user_name>< rating>

By far this was the worst experience ever I can’t believe how they dropped the ball I had a window delivery  from 6:20 to 8:20 at night and I waited till 1130 at night.. Called the sales rep many times in between that to ask where are the delivery guys and he was very helpful.. called them the next morning and you would think they would at least give me a phone call but received nothing  and they want to throw it off like they made the delivery but never ever made the delivery and I even pulled up my cameras to call their bluff but they still have the nerve to try to say I was not home..You truly lost a great customer<//Text>

<Name>Amy Cobb<//Name><time>1577179422567</time><rate>5</rate><Text>Long story short, my shopping experience was quick, efficient and I left satisfied knowing I got a great deal on a quality recliner my husband would be delighted to find waiting for him Christmas morning.

I’m not sure why I put off shopping for my husband’s Christmas present for so long. I bought a recliner five years ago, but sadly, I bought a tiny and small recliner when I really needed a big and tall recliner for my husband who is a 6’2” hard working all-torso motor cycling riding machine. He thoroughly enjoyed (wore out) his current recliner, but he deserved a more comfortable and size appropriate throne and Mathis Brothers made it happen. I managed to leave work on time and and got there an hour before Mathis Brothers closed...and I was able to find just the right chair his evening. Though I was like the Goldilocks of recliner shoppers, Erika helped me find just the right recliner to suit his needs and I was checked out and loaded up within an hour from the time I arrived. Erika was incredibly helpful in finding the right chair of the appropriate size, and she suggested a protection plan that put my worries to rest regarding a fabric I liked but feared would not hold up. Sold. The gentleman who loaded me up was equally helpful, spraying the chair with a fabric protector while I played Jenga with my SUV to fit the chair so I could take it home for him to enjoy Christmas morning.

Thank you Erika and Mathis Bothers. You’ll be my first stop next time I have a furniture need! Happy holidays from a super satisfied customer!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1577197616299, 'text': "Amy, We loved reading your account of finding the perfect recliner for your husband!

I wish I had come to this site before my purchase and read all of the ONE STAR reviews. I cannot believe this company has the nerve to continue to treat customers with such disrespect.
I am a recent widow who purchased a new couch for sentimental reasons after my husband passed away on our old couch. Now, I have been waiting for a couch from MB for 2 1/2 months. Every time I call for an update, they give me a different delivery date and a different person who is my "sales manager." Every time, they promise a certain date and every time that date comes and goes without anyone contacting me. This is very frustrating as I got rid of my old couch when they promised the first delivery date, and now my family and I have nothing in that spot as we get yanked around time and time again.
In the meantime, we have purchased other furniture for bedrooms and Mathis has lost out on a lot of business from us. If they could only be honest and reputable and offer something other than lies, they would have had our additional business and I would not be inclined to go all over the internet and tell everyone about our HORRIBLE experience.  This is my first review and I plan to go to many more sites to share while we wait for some action on this situation.
Rit Mathis has some nerve running constant ads with his face guaranteeing quality and service. he should be embarrassed of his company by now. As I said, while reading the reviews here, I can see that I am not alone in theses feelings. Shameful!<//review>

Although this store has many mattresses and furniture to purchase, I would be very careful. They do not do returns on mattresses, pillows, sheets, comforters, and mattress protection products. After speaking with sales associate, Maria Ramirez, I was told to check for defects immediately upon receiving my mattress. This is exactly what my husband and I did. We found that the mattress was defective and even though we spoke to the store manager, they refused to allow us to refund or exchange the mattress despite defects. This is very disappointing and I would not recommend purchasing mattresses from here. I would especially be weary of the workers here because in order to get warranty and return/exchange benefits, you need to purchase additional items on top of your order.</Text>

It seems as if as soon as you step inside the store the sales person jump on you!  My sales person followed me throughout the store.  It was nerve wracking even when I told her I knew where I was found and did not need help.  It’s disturbing and creepy to be followed.< /text>

Sorry to tell you but I have to write this review. I was told by the Sales Rep that I was going to get a 18 Month no interest and this was a huge reason why I have purchased this bunk bed for my kids but. It looks like at the end it was only for 12 months. and after paying so much already for this bunk bed over $1800 plus tax now we have to pay an extra $500 in interest. Careful and don't believe anything the sales reps tell you they are just there to sell you their stuff and make a quick buck like they did to me. I was the unfortunate one that did not read the contract from the card company believing the sales rep. This will be the last time I will do a purchase at this store.< /review>

I wish I had come to this site before my purchase and read all of the ONE STAR reviews. I cannot believe this company has the nerve to continue to treat customers with such disrespect.
I am a recent widow who purchased a new couch for sentimental reasons after my husband passed away on our old couch. Now, I have been waiting for a couch from MB for 2 1/2 months. Every time I call for an update, they give me a different delivery date and a different person who is my "sales manager." Every time, they promise a certain date and every time that date comes and goes without anyone contacting me. This is very frustrating as I got rid of my old couch when they promised the first delivery date, and now my family and I have nothing in that spot as we get yanked around time and time again.
In the meantime, we have purchased other furniture for bedrooms and Mathis has lost out on a lot of business from us. If they could only be honest and reputable and offer something other than lies, they would have had our additional business and I would not be inclined to go all over the internet and tell everyone about our HORRIBLE experience.  This is my first review and I plan to go to many more sites to share while we wait for some action on this situation.
Rit Mathis has some nerve running constant ads with his face guaranteeing quality and service. he should be embarrassed of his company by now. As I said, while reading the reviews here, I can see that I am not alone in theses feelings. Shameful!<//review>

<Review>Although this store has many mattresses and furniture to purchase, I would be very careful. They do not do returns on mattresses, pillows, sheets, comforters, and mattress protection products. After speaking with sales associate, Maria Ramirez, I was told to check for defects immediately upon receiving my mattress. This is exactly what my husband and I did. We found that the mattress was defective and even though we spoke to the store manager, they refused to allow us to refund or exchange the mattress despite defects. This is very disappointing and I would not recommend purchasing mattresses from here. I would especially be weary of the workers here because in order to get warranty and return/exchange benefits, you need to purchase additional items on top of your order.< /Review>< Response>

We have purchased furniture from Mathis Brothers over many years. We were in need of two chairs for our family room and Dylan Valencia helped us and was professional, courteous, extremely knowledgeable, and attentive. We found exactly what we were looking for and also found items we were not looking for that day but were so reasonably priced, we secured rose as well. We are so pleased with our furniture and the service provided. Never hesitate to shop at Mathis Brothers-you will not regret it.</Text>

<date>1604969373307< /date><rate>1<//rate><Review>Overall experience has been everything but enjoyable.  We were up sold on a bed which we were okay with, but then left out some very important details about the $4,000 bed we were purchased.  Not told it doesn’t fall under their 365 mattress satisfaction program which is key.  When the mattress and rug we had ordered were delivered not only were the delivery guys in a rush, throwing things around and seemed annoyed and hated their job but the “brand new” rug was stained and looked like it had been cut with scissors by a 5th grader and the mattress came with a rip in the bottom.  We rejected the rug and our called our salesperson who said to keep the mattress and that we will get a new one ordered and replaced the following day.  The following day we followed up on what to do. We drove 45 mins to go in and talk, we met with the GM who thought 5% off a ripped $4,000 mattress was enough to compensate for the inconvenience, that was a complete insult. He then said we could re order the same bed and it would be covered by there 365 day satisfactory guarantee. We left satisfied only to find out that was not the case, it was covered by the guarantee not could they order the mattress anymore as it was discontinued.  We then had to start our search again and if it were not for the second salesperson we talked to Linda, we would have cancelled everything and left. Luckily she was as nice as could be, not pushy at all and more then helpful. We ended up ordering a completely different mattress and will see how that delivery process goes.

Update 11/9/20. Received the last part of our order, full bedroom set. This set came broken and looking like a hot mess. Again spending a few thousand dollars on something I would expect there to be better quality control from both the manufacturer and Mathis Brothers.  No response today from anyone other than our old salesperson who no longer works there.  Have tried to get ahold of Fred and Deepak but have not heard back today.  The customer service at this this store is as bad as I have ever seen. Will never be back and never recommend this place to anyone that I know.</Review>< pictures>

Awful customer service. Bought two beds for my sons back in April and one was very wobbly, I called Mathis Brothers and informed them, they said they would have someone come out and evaluate the bed which they did and informed me I need two end pieces the ones I have were faulty. The tech assured me that he will let them know and order my new ends. Two weeks later I dont hear anything from anyone at Mathis Brothers so I decided to call them and they said it will be delivered in 6 to 8 weeks and its now August 16th and I have yet to receive my end pieces for the bed. Just awful, I will not be ordering anything else from Mathis Brothers.</review>

Really nice furniture store. I paid for delivery and was told it’ll be a white glove delivery and that I will receive a 2 hour window also was told all plastic shrink wrap, card board will be removed outside home. Anyways I didn’t receive a 2 hour window more like 15 minutes, second they removed all cardboard and plastic wrap in my living room and my couch was missing a pillow and they left my floors dirty with black marks ( a new home) id probably still buy furniture from here just won’t do delivery.</Review>

<review>We went to Mathis Brothers cuz my mother-in-law always wanted to go there. Her name is Betty Palmer and she sent me one chair at your store and that was it she is very content with the chair and we bought two. The salesperson was amazing no complaints there he took his right where we needed to go and we walked into the store. Our delivery was spot-on it only took 2 days. The chairs are at home and she loves them. I have shopped at your store before for my granddaughter I think you have an amazing store and everyone there is so friendly. I would definitely come back to your store again. Again thank you we love the chairs service was great Livery was good no complaints. Thank you so much<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1571867798042, 'text': 'We are excited to read you had a great overall experience shopping with us!

< review>
Very disappointed.  After an amazing previous experience this go around was a big let down.  I have spent housands of dollars from the Ontario location buying their high end furniture and I intended to furnish my whole house with them.  Bought an A.R.T gables cal king bed which I was told was in stock and was even given a scheduled delivery date.  I called them on the eve of the delivery since I thought I would have received a time window by then, only to be nonchalantly told my bed will be delivered when the rest of my order becomes available.  Huh?  No communication no apology, just matter of fact take it or leave it attitude.  Mind you, this is different to what I was told in person at the store.  Off to find a store with good customer service even if it means paying a bit more.  It is a pity  because their sales folks are amazing.

Update: After a lot of communication back and forth, cancelations, re-order and re-cancellations I finally contacted their Irvine branch with much better results.  I got my bed and love it so far.  Now I need the matching nightstands (should cost around $3000 for the 2, what can u say i love A.R.T furniture) and came back to read reviews . With some recent reviews mimicking my experience there, namely  great sales rep and horrible delivery experience, I am very reluctant to buy.  MATHIS brothers can you bring back the management team you had back in early to mid 2019? I don't know if management changed but I know for sure the customer care quality have dropped.  I will be watching the reviews closely before I make my next purchase.  A guy spent almost 20K and got horrible service? Scary.< /review>

We ordered a couch and love seat.  The sales person text me to let me know the couches were ready.  He told me that I would be called the day before with a time.  At six o'clock on Friday night I did not hear anything so I text the sales person.  He had previously told me we should be a morning delivery.  He sent me the confirmation and it said they would be dropped between 8:48 to 10:48.  I had someone pick up my couches at 10:00 am.  When no one showed up at 11:00,I text my sales person.  He said he was not at the store and for me to call the delivery department.  I called and spoke with someone who told me they were going to be delivered at night.  I told him I needed them delivered by five.  He said that couldn't happen and that we would have to reschedule and could get the delivery money back.  I asked to talk to a supervisor.  The supervision called an hour later and said he would check it out and call me back in a few minutes.  After not hearing anything I called the delivery center and Jennifer looked at the emails and said it someone should have told us a reschedule takes 48 hours.  First I heard that.  She was able to schedule for the next evening.  I text the sales person and asked about the delivery fee back.  He said he would check it out I am still waiting.  The lack of communication with these people was horrible.< /text>

< Review>
Initial delivery date was pushed back twice, by one day and then by three.  Installation services were very fast and arrived a couple hours before scheduled time. Was overcharged for two backordered items, but was refunded at delivery.  Took about an hour to pickup the backordered items, waiting a long time for service at the cashier's desk, and another long wait at the delivery dock.  Products delivered performed as expected.  Planned to buy more stuff but was too tired to return to the store.  Went to competitor to shop and was in and out in short order at the competitor.  New mattress is much more comfortable than the old one that was replaced.< /Review>

I cannot write a genuine review now since I am still working with the sales associate to resolve a problem with my purchase. I bought a sofa and loveseat and the two pieces were delivered in two different colors. Still in the process of having this resolved.
The furniture is good and I believe this color issue will be resolved.
Luke, the sales associate I worked with is great. Treated me with respect.</Review>

I purchased an ajustable bed ( $500 )with the extended warranty ( $300 ) because I was told I would not have to worry about struggling if something went wrong with it. It’s been 3 weeks and they still keep giving me different numbers to call. The store managers can’t nothing. Now I have made contact with the manufacturer, I have to be moving my heavy mattress on and off trying to reset it after numerous times, they have finally agreed to send parts that I have to switch myself. Did I mention I’m a veteran with back issues!!!! I don’t recommend buying any bed or extend warranty’s with them.< /text>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>My husband and I went it to see about a recliner. We were greeted immediately , and when told we would just be looking around,  the gentleman discreetly left us to our own devices. When we found the chair we were looking for, a very helpful young man by the name of Dontae wasnt far away and gave us great customer service. He was friendly, well dressed , polite and efficient. We walked away with a very nice chair for an acceptable price. I'm pleased,  and will be returning in the future.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Our sales rep was wonderful.  Showed us the areas to look at for the couches we were considering then gave us time alone to browse.

She was great about  finding what we needed. Did not feel pressured at all.

Only issue was she did not finish scheduling the delivery....we called and customer service was good about rescheduling. I don't think it was at all intentional.

The delivery guys were great and even moved out our old couches (we just could not do it ourselves.). We have now purchased three major furniture pieces with Mathias (another recliner couch) and a beautiful dining set.

Felt uncomfortable from the minute we walked in. Everyone at the front reception staring/profiling the people walking in. Then one of the salesperson yelled “ARE YOU ALL TOGETHER”? What happened to the usual “welcome”? I’ve worked in the retail industry my whole life, 24 years, from selling furniture, Real State and car sales and so far this is one of the rudest places I have set foot in.</Review>

Roya was quick to take my money and never placed my order. When I went in to purchase my mattress the day before my supposedly scheduled date, the manager noticed there was no date scheduled for my furniture to be delivered. Chris Campos the manger was super helpful and a pleasure to work with.  He receives 5 stars for his professionalism during my entire experience. I highly recommend Yvonne Sinclair as your sales representative if you’re looking for furniture at Matthis Brothers. She really went out of her way on my last visit I purchased furniture from them. Due to COVID she was off when I went back :(</text>

We spend so much money with Mathis bro’s to be given the run around over something so simple. I refuse to ever give them another dime. I moved out of my apartment July 14th so I scheduled for my broken couch to be picked up and either serviced or replaced 5 days prior because the warranty is still in place and they said It would take at least 5 days to service and be delivered to my new place. They never showed up the first time so we called to reschedule the pick-up to another date, when this date arrives they show up to the wrong house and refused to make their mistake right and just didn’t show up again. Mind you this is 2 days of either me or my fiancé calling off of work to wait for them. Got ahold of customer service and the lady on the phone had an attitude and insisted that she was the manager and supervisor and that there was nothing she could do for me but reschedule. Long story short we rescheduled two more times and I bet you can guess the outcome of those “reschedules.” This has been the most exhausting, inconvenient, and inconsiderate experience I have ever had. I am tempted to throw this couch out and go spend my money with someone professional, convenient and who actually understands the concepts of time being wasted and basic customer service skills. This has been an absolutely appalling run around and I hope someone at this company decides to finally do their job and make this right because this is not fair or practical by any means! I am highly deeply and sincerely disappointed, dissatisfied and upset.</review></record></dataset><record>

Bought my son a bed that was in stock, spent over 2,000 dollars On it. Delivery was set for last Friday but didn’t close escrow on our house that week. So was told they would be able to deliver it next week, now they are saying they sold it even though we already paid for it and had delivery set up for the upcoming week. They sold our  bed to some one else even though we paid full amount.< /Review>

Went in and told the sales person I needed a sectional and it would be preferred to arrive the second week of January. He said not a problem it would get here BEFORE the date and we could schedule a time to deliver it. Ordered 12/28, needed it by 01/13. Two days before got a text message from the sales person saying it would arrive on Monday (01/13) between 8am and 4pm. My wife and I waited all day and I took off work for this. At 5:30pm I called the store and they said the delivery was cancelled because the piece was missing legs. So they reordered it. Fast forward to 01/18, they called me a assured me the sectional was in and it had all the pieces so the deliver would be on 01/21 between 4pm and 9pm. They called at 4pm and stated they had to cancel my deliver AGAIN because it was missing legs. Even after the manager verified everything was there. The only thing they were going to offer me for all of this was free shipping (a whopping $50 off) and only $60 off the sectional. And it was going to take another month for it to get here. I cancelled everything and went to Bob’s. Worst experience ever.</text>< pics>

Unfortunately, The Covid-19 Pandemic has had a significant impact on the manufacture of furniture across the United States, and across the world. The dates that you have been given come directly from the Manufacturers as to when they best estimate they can fulfill an order and have it delivered to our Distribution Centers. Many of their factories have been shutdown for extended periods of time and they are working to ramp up production to fulfill orders as fast as they can. Unfortunately, delays on their end happen, which leads to their representatives informing us of a change in dates on when they think they can fulfill the order, which we then have to pass on to the customer.

I send the pics the next day I must have called 4 times and each time spoke to different customer service people, Leana, Lisa Gotta, Mercedes no one wanted to help they kept saying  we will exchange your sofa and chair and half, I emailed and advised I needed this in writing after reading all the negative
reviews were people were not getting answers. It is June 26th and still Lisa stated that she would email me to confirm exchange and delivery date well she never sent an email.  If you are thinking of shipping at Mathis Brothers be careful very disappointing experience no one cares to resolve complaints about their furniture.<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< UserId.>

Our salesperson, Dylan was amazing!! He wasn't high pressure at all & at one point he got a furniture dolly & put the recliner we for sure were buying on it & moved it around the store for us. We ended up finding the perfect loveseat to go with 2 of the recliners. We will definitely be back👍😁!!</Review>

The store was bright and clean.  The floor plan was very easy to follow. Their displays were very put together. Very visual Pleasing. So  an inexperience decorator could still plan and put a room together that would be very professional.  Their customer service were great and fantastic they were very knowledgeable very friendly and very professional. They made sure that all your questions were answered. So you were comfortable making a purchase from them.
I have made many purchases from them and had the same great experience with them every single time.<//Review>

Well unfortunately because of the coronavirus it took us two months to receive our furniture so not Mathis brothers‘s fault but my sales rep was very patient and very courteous and making me feel OK due to the fact that my furniture got delayed unexpectedly and learn things about shipping cost of next  always pay for your stuff to be delivered free delivery service it’s not good your furniture should be assembled not you have to simple yourself that was my most disappointing part about the whole thing you offer me free service.
So that was a lesson I learned what that meant wasn’t explain so my coffee tables are still sitting in the box because I have to put it together one day and that I’m very happy with the furniture and appreciate purchasing stuff from Mathis brothers for the first time thank you. please inform your customer what free service mean your not furniture assembled 😫
Thank you<//Text>

<Review>I was told by the sales  representative that if I purchased the cover for the Temperpetic Mattress that I would be able to return the item within 30 days if I was unhappy. He asked if I wanted to purchase a pillow I said no because sleeping with a pillow makes me wake up in the middle of the night gasping for my breathe. He then asked if I wanted to purchase the warranty and I said no because there is a warranty on the mattress. As soon as I got the mattress I called him to ask if they delivered the wrong one. He said no, had me check and he was correct. The mattress was not soft like the one I tried out at the store, he said walk on it and give it a couple of days, so I did and after a couple of days I contacted him and informed him that I would like a different mattress. He said he would talk to his manager, his manager said no because I didn't purchase the pillow and the warranty. Aforementioned, sales person said if I was not happy within 30 days I can bring it back if I purchase the cover. Manager said sorry you can't return something you slept on. I said but I could if I bought the pillows and warranty? He then gave me customer service phone number and that maybe they could change the decision. I called customer service and they said its not up to them but the sales person and his supervisor but that they would make a note that the sales person said I could return it in 30 days. I then contacted the sales person with this information and still hasn't gotten back to me. I spent A LOT OF MONEY there and all I wanted was a replacement mattress that I LOVE but to no avail. My only recourse now is to contact the creditor they set me up with and refute the purchase because the sales person gave me false information and had me purchase a $230 cover just incase if I wasn't happy I could return the item in 30 days. I can only post this if I click on the star, but I'd give Mathis Brothers Furniture ZERO STARS if I could!< /Review>< Time>

Love Mathis Furniture store however our order was set back multiple times due to parts of items not available... this made it worse during the time we tried to move into a new home and we had things that needed to done in order. There are a couple of items still broken and still waiting for the technician to come out and fix. 2 stars for the store and its furniture selection. We won't be returning to Mathis... we will take our business elsewhere like Ashley or Living Spaces etc.</text>

Our experience with Mathis Brothers has been terrible. Here is a timeline of events:
1. We bought our couch on Sunday, June 16. We were told it would be delivered on Monday, June 17. We were so excited! This was one of our first major furniture purchases as husband and wife.
2. Monday, the couch arrives and it is the wrong one. We tell the deliverers and they take a picture. We also call Mathias to report the issue, and they don't seem to believe us. They ask us to take pictures to confirm the issue. The first time the pictures did not go through. We had to resend them.
3. On Tuesday, we call back and get told that yes, we were given the wrong couch and that the correct one would be delivered on Friday.
4. Friday comes along, and we haven't heard from Mathias about a delivery time. We call. Apparently the couch is out of stock and more will be delivered to the location sometime next week (they do not have a date). Mathis never called to tell us this that the delivery time changed, we had to follow up ourselves.
All the salesmen talked about the whole time we were looking for a couch at their location was about their excellent record with costumer service. However, this has not been our experience. Mathias has not communicated sufficiently with us and our problem remains unsolved with no end to this nightmare in sight.
The selection is good and the salesmen will talk a mean game, but if you run into an actual problem, do not expect it to be solved in a timely manner or receive any support.
UPDATE: We went back to the store and have now been told that it will be at least 4 weeks before our couch arrives. Again, Mathis never told us this until we hunted them down for answers.<//review>

We went there to look at a new bed and bedroom set. I talked to Joe Norio. He was easy to deal with - no pressure. We ended up buying a king bed and new bedroom set. Joe had it delivered 2 days later at our request so we could get the carpet cleaned. That was great since I didnt have to assemble it and get rid of the boxes.  They took the old mattress too. If your looking for a new bed or some new furniture I would stop by and see Joe.< /Review>

The Ontario Service department RUDE... RUDE... RUDE.

After you make your purchase and they make their money customer service goes out the door.

Customer service is undeniably terrible after making a purchase. The day I made my purchase there were other upset customers complaining and even asking for their money back. Didn’t think much of it until I came home with half my order after I went to pick it up and was told I needed to wait an additional week for the remaining items if I wanted them delivered.  Naturally I wanted them the following day and I was told that if I didn’t like it to go get it myself.

When I asked to speak with management she hung up on me and I was unable to contact anyone else after because it was already close to closing hours.</text>

Customer service is okay! I keep on calling them when they deliver the furniture the first time they didn't know. They don't call you you call them. The second time they didn't know for sure what day to deliver to you. There is enough place to park here. There is a lot of people to help you here. The place is neat and clean. Neighborhood is good. They have nice furniture here all different kinds. The price is okay.👍</Review>

< Review>
We had our delivery in two nights. The first crew moved our love seat to our patio so our new love seat could be replaced. But when our couch came the crew refused to move couch or even help us move it to the patio, 10 ft away! They called someone and they said they were not allowed to move anything! No one told us that we had to move our couch in order for them to bring in our new couch that we spent over 3000 dollars on! I will never buy from them again!<//Review>

<text>I have been in the market for a formal dining room set for quite some time when my aunt recommended Mathis Bros Ontario where she had bought furniture before. First of all, there were so many choices on the showroom floor which I really appreciated, being that we live in a time where just about everything is ordered  online w/ out seeing it in person. With such a major purchase I didn’t want to do that, so Mathis Bros Ontario was the perfect place. The icing on the cake was working w/ sales rep Josh Rothschild who went above and beyond the call of duty. He sent me pictures & videos at my request & was essential in helping me find the perfect costume table & chairs for my home. Plus it arrived (1) week early!!!! Thx Mathis Bros for being a premier furniture store who hires individuals who take pride in customer services.

<Review>Went in on 6/12 to look for a dinning room set, Chelsy Kelly helped us was very helpful and not pushy. Found a set that I loved, while we were there decided to look at couches although I had already found some elsewhere that I was going to purchase I found a sectional that I feel in love with.
Purchased both items Chelsy was clear with us about the table being on back order due to covid and that the sectional would be about 2 weeks, no problem. I believed I called on 6/25 since there was no follow up, a supervisor by the name of Asan called me back said the table was now expected middle of August and sectional by July 15th, no problem. I called today to follow myself was told the new ETA on the table is now mid September and the sectional mid August. Now I have a problem we moved into a new home and have no furniture and although we're trying to be understanding i have no confidence the ETA is accurate will be looking at other places this weekend and attempt to find something else and hope that i love it as much as I did these other items. I am very disappointed in the lack of communication< /Review>< pictures>

Always seem to find exactly what I am looking for here. I recently bought a new living room set and within minutes our sales person found us what we were looking for. Seems to be much higher quality than the other places, yet still similar pricing. Old story of you get what you pay for.< /text>

Unbelieveable time on hold, about 10 in & hung up. As a longtime customer of Mathis Brothers this was unacceptable customer service. Pandemic or not, if you want customers to buy have better staffing.<//text>

<review>Honestly, do not bother buying from Mathis Brothers in Ontario. They do not sell quality product, I have had 3 couches break in 3 years (No kid house hold). My couch will be fixed however I will have to pay for pick up and delivery... Their customer service is just as bad as their product. I have requested the store manager to call me and it has been two weeks with no response.<//review></record>

After they set it up we found the top component to adjust the head was not working. We immediately called the delivery guy and customer service. We don’t have good cell reception where we live so it would take the truck awhile to get back up here. By the time we got off the phone with customer service the delivery guy was back and fixed the issue. Very impressive.<//review>< Pics>

I love the Chair but, it took 45 days to get it, I did not recieve updates as to when it would arrive

an update would of been great

My rep would not answer a basic question from me until the product was paid for, then he told me it would arrive onn june 28, we recieve the chair July 12th

I guess if i would have purchased it from Amazon, I would have had better communication< /text>

My experience with Mathis Bros was very good. Huge store, so it took awhile to see.  Everyone was friendly and definitely not pushy. They were there if we had any questions.

The delivery people were very nice, people who answer the phone very polite. Their system is horrible. We got furniture delivered back in July and we still had three more pieces which were delivered yesterday. Back in July they brought the wrong box spring and they ask me to keep it until they deliver the last three pieces at which time they would pick up  Yesterday when they delivered I said you also have to take the box spring. Unfortunately the delivery people didn’t have any knowledge of that so they tried calling their dispatch lady to ask what to do. They were told NO can’t pick up they have to set up another appointment for it to be picked up because they had no paperwork with them. I began by dealing with the salesperson until he stopped returning calls (this after the order was paid in full). Then I spoke to a manager that was very nice an apologetic and assured me that all would be
taken care of and that the pieces should be in for delivery by end of September. Since I didn’t get a call I called them October 4? They informed me that the furniture was in so I made  an appointment for it to be delivered. The gentleman I spoke with said someone should have called to set up this appointment. So I called the manager who I spoke with before and unfortunately he was out on medical leave. So now I was talking to a third person (another manager). My experience has been very frustrating. Once we paid the order in full they stopped their proactive communication. DO NOT pay your bill until you know for sure all the furniture you ordered is in. We were told all the furniture was in back in July and they needed full payment so we sent it in and we found out at delivery 3 pieces were missing.</text>

<text>Very disappointed once again.  Received three of four pieces of our order.  Called the salesman (Vu) and couldn’t get a straight answer.  The fourth item was a) back ordered b) in Ontario c) in Irvine.  Manager called back and said they made an error and could have it Delivered Friday.  Out of town guests arrive tomorrow.  If they made the error why can’t they do the right thing and have it delivered tomorrow?  No go.  Cancelled the order.  Should have gone to Restoration Hardware.<//text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Mathis Brothers has a beautiful showroom in Ontario, California. However, we first stopped at the Tustin store and found a dining table that we liked but were unsure if the size would fit our dining room. The salesman who helped us was very friendly but a little too persistent in getting us to complete the paperwork for the dining set. He said we could call later and cancel if it wasn’t the right size. He brought it up several times before we ended up leaving the store, saying we wanted to measure our room before ordering. The next day we went to the Ontario store and the salesman was much less pushy. We ended up ordering a different dining set that was better suited for our room and had it delivered the next week. We love the new dining set!< /Review>

To answer any of our questions without being pushy. She responded immediately to all of my communication.

< review>
I came here to buy an all natural mattress and found everything I needed including pillows, sheets en frame. We had a ton of questions and John could answer them all.

We had the time to try different beds, different pillows and different configurations.

The delivery was timely and we love the bed. When one of the wires on the frame broke after 2 weeks, we got a new one the next day.

We took a long time finding a good store for natural mattresses and can wholeheartedly recommend this shop.< /review>

the men who came out and placed the furniture were great. that was the only good part of this. the footstool is 4" shorter than the couch or loveseat. when I tried to contact mathis brothers directly through this survey it did not give me the choice of my store. then I could not skip that section and had to answer the questions as if I went to a store out of state. poor website and drop downs. the couch we ordered is too hard compared to what we were told and shown in the store. we selected a fabric and had this 'custom' made so we are stuck.< /review>

<text>The buying experience was great. The sales rep Chelsy was very helpful and patient with us. We made a purchase in May 2020 and it has now been over a month and we still have yet to recieve our items. I understand because of covid-19, that things are on back order and it's taking longer than normal for delivery, but what upsets me is that no one has called to notify me of any updates and when I call I keep getting different delivery dates. First it was June 12th and then June 19 and then June 22nd and now it turns out it won't be here till July 12th?? I don't have any couches at my house because from the beginning I was told it would take 30 days at the most so we got rid of them to prepare to receive the new sectional. I wish they would have a solid answer instead of giving customers the run around. And as much as we want that sectional we might need to cancel our order and check other furniture stores because we can't be without an couches for another 30 days as we're a family of 6 and expecting.</text>< Date>

The short story:
Run! This store will only teach you that price and quality are not related. They sell cheaply made and low quality furniture for high prices. What good is a somewhat good looking sofa in a dumpster?

The details:
A $2332.95 sofa which was on clearance (19% off) did not even make it to be used once.
There is no return or even warranty because it was on clearance. Customer service is so rude and unhelpful, you feel like you bought a 200$ sofa online and they are wondering what you expected for the price.
The funny thing, the online store would take the sofa back, repair it and be somewhat polite.
This store is the best example to why retail is dying.</Text>

I have previously purchased furniture from Mathis Brothers during the past years and each time, I have been completely satisfied with their furniture and their service.  If anyone is considering to purchase furniture, I highly recommend that you visit a Mathis Brother's Furniture Store.<//Review>

We purchased a bedroom set for our daughter back in August and it's been a real mess. First there were pieces missing on her order when they delivered the items not everything was delivered. Second her mattress still sits on the floor since they didn't have the box spring in stock, it's been 2 months and they've sent to different people and they still can't figure out how to put a box spring under her bed. Yesterday they delivered her vanity set and again hardware was missing and now we have to set up another delivery date. I'm very disappointed with Mathews Brothers and the service we have received. We paid a lot of money for a top-notch bedroom set and they can't seem to get it right.</Review>

<text>Loved original buying experience and bought a recliner. Was given a delivery date in mid April. Never heard from salesperson. Texted Mathis for update. Rep said she’d contact salesperson. Never heard. Rep said she’d contact sales manager at Irvine store for delivery date. Since tv ads are offering free delivery I requested free delivery given them going past delivery date and no response from Mathis! Very disappointed and won’t buy from them again. RIT what’s up? Solve! Call with delivery date and make delivery FREE for inconvenience and no response from Irvine store.<//text>< Pics>

Staff was pretty helpful didn't like that management was not there to assist with good customer service I purchased a clearance item that had details of why it was marked down tag read the same thing twice after my cash purchase the worker notice more damages and when brought to manager attention he stated that only so many characters can be noted on tag yet had repeated same defects twice on tag when brought to his attention he didn't care that it was more damage than they listed. I was satisfied that the laborer  pointed it out to and assisted to help me and sent it to the back to help with damage where they added hardware to stabilize the product that I purchased which was a bed frame and headboard<//review>

Loved original buying experience and bought a recliner. Was given a delivery date in mid April. Never heard from salesperson. Texted Mathis for update. Rep said she’d contact salesperson. Never heard. Rep said she’d contact sales manager at Irvine store for delivery date. Since tv ads are offering free delivery I requested free delivery given them going past delivery date and no response from Mathis! Very disappointed and won’t buy from them again. RIT what’s up? Solve! Call with delivery date and make delivery FREE for inconvenience and no response from Irvine store.<//text>

<review>I was very impressed with the selection of their furniture, their sales team (especially Issa), and how fast I received my furniture! I've been furniture shopping for my new home for the last couple weeks & I was tired of hearing "it will be 4-6 weeks before your delivery." But Mathis Brothers was different! I bought my dining room set on 9/5 & FOUR days later it was delivered! I'm telling all my family & friends about my amazing experience with Mathis Brothers, they truly are in a league of their own!< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1568207756511, 'text': 'We are excited to read you had a great overall experience shopping with us!

The first time I ordered furniture from Mathis, I worked with Joshua Rothschild. He was attentive, honest, thorough and incredibly knowledgeable. Overall an AMAZING experience working with him. The second time I ordered from Mathis, I worked with a different salesperson who completely soured the experience for me. He made several misrepresentations just so that he could make a sale, which cost me a ridiculous amount of money in the end. When I brought this to his attention, his only response was, “sorry.” He was also extremely unprofessional, texting me after hours, and gave me incomplete/inaccurate information. Mathis furniture can get pretty expensive and when I pay that kind of money, I expect better. Will NEVER shop at Mathis again.</text>

If you're shopping for Furniture,  this is the place you want to go to... don't downgrade to cheaper and affordable furniture stores because the quality of the furniture won't be the same. You might pay a little bit more here but the quality is 100% better and when it comes to leather, you're getting real leather nothing fake here at Mathis !! ... I highly highly recommend Mathis  !!<//review>

There were some pretty good deals on clearance items. Be careful though male sure you take a good look at an item before you purchase. To me the rest of the store was like any other furniture store on the expensive side. They did have a neat little sidewalk cafe, though I didn't eat there.<//review>

<text>Extremely disappointed in Mathis Brothers and a shocking experience I had with one of their customer service reps. Short version: I have a gift card for Mathis Brothers that I've been unable to use, and the customer rep who was trying to "help" me, Lenora Thomas, simply hung up the phone on me while I was trying to resolve the issue.

Longer version of the story: I recently received a $200 gift card from my parents for my birthday. As there is currently a pandemic locking down much of the country, I decided to shop online for my Mathis Brothers product to spend my gift certificate on. Once I found the item and tried to check out, I was surprised to see that I could not use my gift card on the website (pretty surprising for any business these days). All the same I contacted customer service, and I received a very prompt reply from Lenora Thomas via text. She instructed me to email her photos of my gift card so she could process my order. I found this very unusual, but I followed the instructions. She then asked what I was hoping to order. I told her the lamp I wanted to buy. Then she said she would call me the next day. I never received a call. I texted asking if there was a good time to talk. She simply told me they couldn't find my account number and therefore couldn't help me. I did not know what this meant, so I tried calling her back a few times. I finally got through. Lenora told me she couldn't allow me to use my gift card and that I had to go into a store. I found this surprising and unusual (I live 2 hours away from the nearest store and wasn't even sure if they were open during lockdown). I asked if we could simply complete the order over the phone or online. She refused. I asked to speak to the manager. She left, appeared to ask her manager something, then returned and said I'd need to visit a store. I told her I lived a couple hours away from the nearest store and was hoping to complete my order some other way. After refusing to help me further, I asked to speak with her manager. She refused then hung up on me. I was shocked and disappointed. I can't believe this is how Mathis Brothers treats there customers.
I was simply looking forward to spending my gift money from my parents on an item at Mathis Brothers, but now it doesn't even seem like I'm able to do that and my $200 has gone to waste. I'm sad and so are my parents because they were looking forward to seeing what I would purchase. This has left such a bad taste in my mouth, and I'm sad to say I will be steering everyone I know away from Mathis Brothers in the future.
If anyone from Mathis Brothers does read this, I'm still hoping to put my gift card to use.</text><date>1590784443461< /date>< Response>

We would like to know what type of gift card you have. If it's one of the typical giftcards that has a card number, etc. on it, we should have been able to accept it without coming to a store. If it's a paper giftcard, those need to be brought in the store because there is not a card number, so there's no way to track it. It's more of a gift certificate.

Would give this place ZERO stars, if I could!!!
I was putting down deposit for something I really like and called back for delivery.
I've gotten told that it's sold
It's really ridiculous.</Review>

<review>Don’t shop here, they are very deceiving. I purchased a sofa set and rug a few weeks ago and I thought the Sales process went fine until I was mislead. I went in for the sofa set but made mention that I could use an area rug for another room in the future. The Sales Rep  Jasmin Luna showed me rugs and said to take one home and see if it fits and if you like the color, if it doesn’t work then just bring it back, no problem. What she didn’t say is that you only have 7 days to return it and if you did meet the 7 days there would be a restocking fee. Of course I emailed her and she hasn’t responded to me, so I called their Customer Service. Their Customer Service Rep apologized and said that their Sales Reps do that a lot and there is nothing she could do in her end. She gave me a persons phone number to call, we will see how that works out but I’m thinking I’m stuck with a $700 rug I will never use. Please beware of this if you shop there, it appears they only care about their commission.</review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1583183855211, 'text': 'Bill, We apologize for any miscommunication you received about our policies from your salesperson.

<Text>Great furniture selection and good service from sales staff.  Low rating is a direct result of store not delivering products as promised.  Purchased approximately $6000.00 worth of products with a promised delivery of today.  When yhe truck arrived, we were told they were only here to pick up mattress.  None of our goods were delivered and no firm delivery date provided.  This to me is poor service.</Text>< Rating>

MADE A PURCHASE ON 1/26/20 WITH SARA HUNTER, REQUESTED DELIVERY FOR 2/15/20. SARA FAILED TO SCHEDULE DELIVERY. WHEN THE DELIVERY WAS FINALLY MADE THE WRONG FURNITURE WAS DELIVERED. MY DEBIT CARD WAS CHARGED TWICE FORCING ME TO FILE FRAUDULENT CHARGES WITH MY BANK. SPOKE TO 3 DIFFERENT MANAGERS AND SEVERAL CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVES ALL WERE UNPROFESSIONAL AND CLUELESS. THE ONLY ONE THAT MADE AN EFFORT TO HELP WAS LISA, THE 4TH MANAGER I HAD SPOKEN TO. I WAS OFFERED TO HAVE THE DELIVERY FEE REFUNDED AND THAT HASNT HAPPENED. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE AND ZERO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.<//review>

<Review>I’ve been granted financing some very lovely furniture from Mathis/Synchrony prior to this recent endeavor, and unless I can pick up and deliver anything from them again, I will NOT choose their delivery service.

Twice, when stated delivery was between 2 pm to 9 pm, my items were at the very end of their list of deliveries! Waiting till almost 9pm for the truck to finally show felt rude and careless, in light of 2 phone inquiries telling me they were 30 minutes away.

Also, unless I’m willing to pay for items ordered online with my own credit, the Synchrony Mathis account is useless until I’ve set foot inside their showrooms.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>When buying anything you should never feel pressured into anything. Sean was great at first then came out to strong, pushy, and with not so much of a great manager. If I'm willing to spend $$$ and big money, you should never tell your customer, " well if you don't take it, trust me someone else will". This made me very uncomfortable because the way he said it made it seem like I wasn't good enough to by anything there. Yvonne, Guy and Derek are amazing and very patient  for sure. They are great sales people because they don't make you feel like your not good enough to buy, and don't pressure you to make a quick decision because someone else can jump on it. Thank you Steven for reaching back to us, but I still feel pressured.</Review><date>1572901581245<//date>< Name>

I bought a power recliner chair there over a year ago.  When a mechanism broke, I contacted customer service for warranty repair...... I was happy to be getting my chair repaired! However, from the beginning it was a series of mistakes and mishaps.... First, the parts that were shipped were missing pieces I was told, therefore another 4 to 6 week delay. Second, there was never any followup or communication from Mathis bros.... After waiting 3 months, I just finally gave up! I will never buy from Mathis bros or never own a piece of Lane furniture again.... Not happy about wasting my money with no compensation or offer of customer service satisfaction at all!   Buyer beware....< /text>

Chelsy did an awesome job of informing us about the different sectional couches we were looking at and gave us "space" on our decision making as well.  We bought a very nice sectional and a entertainment console from her.</Review>

<text>The showroom is huge so there is a lot to look at. Salesperson zeros into you as soon as you walk through the door and follows you around. They have a high monthly quota to meet, so they are just trying to do their job. I think I tired out my 1st salesperson, and he didn't think I was a serious buyer, so after awhile, he set his target on a new incoming customer and I was able to peruse on my own, which is how I prefer it. When I was ready to purchase, the nearest salesperson was helpful, informative and friendly.  Assembly was required for the dining table, bench & chairs, which we did at home easily.  We also picked up our own furniture which is located at the same building as the showroom, so it was very convenient.</text>< Pictures>

Every aspect of this purchase, through the Mathis Bros design warehouse in Ontario, was outstanding. Chair was purchased on Sunday afternoon and delivered to south Orange County on Wednesday morning. Impressive customer service every step of the way from start to finish. Highly recommended, with appreciation.</Review>

< review>
We found chairs that seem to be good quality for the price. We specifically asked about delivery charges and communicated the city we live in.  We were told $99 for both chairs.  During the checkout process the salesperson said something about joining  a delivery service membership for $69 to get a delivery discount. We declined because it was our first purchase there and didn’t know if we would be back. After checkout we discovered we were charged significantly more and questioned the person at the concierge desk located by the front door.  We were told delivery was actually $149 plus 3% of purchase price.  He told us we had to join the membership to get the $99 delivery.  Say what???  The delivery charges are high and the process  is very deceptive. Adding three percent to the overall cost is just a sneaky way of charging a higher price after the sale is made.  We will think twice before going back.< /review>

Everyone was professional helpful and  introduced themselves. They were knowledgeable , our sales rep Denise listened to exactly what we were looking for . She directed us to the area and kindly stepped away DIDNT try to push the item but gave us space to discuss.
We left to go see other stores and compare prices &  items . Those places didn’t have the friendliness staff nor the atmosphere like Mathis.
With the exception of check out, very different staff. Very disappointing with her ( can’t recall if her was Roni or something like similar to a male name).  Not friendly expressionless. Didn’t ask us what we were placing down assumed $600 and presented paperwork with that on it. When we said $400 she sighed.<//review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Bought a desk I was told was in stock. Most of my shipment was delivered on 7/27 as expected. Did not find out my desk was not coming until the delivery team showed up. Delivery team supposedly called to check when they could deliver my desk. They advised me August 16th it would be delivered. That date came and went so I called and the rep on the phone blamed the sales agent and did not really offer any support. Still have yet to receive any phone calls from anyone even though I have left multiple messages for my sales rep and called customer service twice. Only reason I gave them 2 stars is because I do like the furniture but customer service is very important. We you are spending nearly 18k at a furniture store you would think they take better care of the customers. Not sure if I will shop here again.

Update: Emailed customer service on 8/23/19, still no response from anyone. Still have not received any "cash back coupons" either. Something about this place is off. Buyer beware!< /text>< pictures>

<Text>Upon arrival we were approached by a male sales person who offered to assist us.  When we told him we already had someone we worked with he, surprisingly, demanded to know who that person was.   We proceeded to another area of the first floor where we noticed him standing near us.  He signaled us over and said I need to know who the person is so we make sure they get credit for the sale.
We felt as if we were being interrogated - which made us feel unwelcome.

My wife has worked in luxury retail for more than 20 years.  She happened to be with me and was shocked at the experience because in luxury service, this behavior is forbidden.

We are loyal customers of this location and never experienced this before.  Sales persons have approached us at the door, and if we indicate we want to look around the person has offered a business card and we always respected that person when we chose to buy.  The ones in the past who politely followed and gave us our space, ultimately ended in us purchasing more.

While we did purchase a piece yesterday, we felt a bit uneasy at the onset and left probably quicker than we would have should we not have had that initial intrusive experience.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I went looking for recliner for Father’s Day, I found it, I bought it, Papa has it, and he is very happy.   I was concerned with size but to my surprise it came in two pieces and fit perfectly.  But I wished you could have delivered it.</Text>

The one star is only for the delivery service because the delivery guys tried to blackmail me. I bought a sectional sofa worth $2k with tax from the store, and my living room is at the second floor. Delivery guy said the stairs are not big enough to get through, but they can complete the job from balcony at the second floor outside if I pay another Hundred dollars. This is totally none sense. I already paid $99 for delivery and assembly when I made the order. Right now, they want another hundred dollars. Isn’t toooooo easy for you guys to make money? Just saying whatever price you want. I think I will return it and never come back again. As a result they just left and the sofa stayed near front door.</Text>

< review>
I’ve been a Mathis Bros customer for years and have furnished many homes solely from this store. You can’t beat the selection, style and prices anywhere!

You never know when fantastic customer service will become an issue. I purchased a piece of furniture that I ended up not being able to use. Mathis Bros Management helped so much! After a trip to the gorgeous Ontario store (imagine a fantastic cafe for lunch!) I was able to select a replacement piece and the unusable piece was picked up and the new one delivered.

I’m so grateful that Mathis Bro’s fantastic customer service came through for me when I needed it. I want to thank Joaquin in the Ontario store, and Robert, Samantha and Charmaine in the Indio store for unbeatable caring customer service!</review>

Excellent Salesperson (Sam).  Good quality furnishings, and fair prices.  We furnished our beach house and it looks great!  One small issue with the hinges on the door if the media center.  I called customer service and it us in the process of getting replacement parts and scheduling a technician to fix it! Overall very satisfied.</review>

<username>Olivia Lopez<//username><review>I am impressed and completely satisfied with the customer service provided by Mathis Brothers Furniture, Ontario, CA.
Jason Sheridan the Sales Associate was professional, and very helpful.  I will definitely seek him out for any future furniture purchases.  The Delivery Team was exceptional!  They were careful with my furniture (from truck to inside my family room).  The team was professional, friendly, and efficient.  Additionally, I love the sectional and high quality of the fabric and construction.  No complaints only applaudes!< /review>< UserId.>

I’ve been in Mathis Brothers several times looking telling myself I could never afford furniture like this The quality of the furniture was so outstanding I would just come in there just to look to see the different pattern and since he was the biggest thing that’s happening in  style read texture from the bedroom hallway down to the living room and kitchen.   One day I took a friend an and she was able to apply for credit and I was shocked she was able to get the couch she wanted customer service was outstanding.    So I said to myself go and make a purchase for yourself I wanted to couch I seen it I applied and I was able to achieve Credit Matthews brothers looks a little timid date  my biggest regret is that I should’ve did this for myself sooner . Thank you Matthews brothers A person like me is not too little for your store . Sylvia Johnson< /text>

Big Mike was awesome and the perfect sales person for us. Not pushy, didn't try to sell us things we didn't ask for and was able to recognize that we had a specific piece of furniture in mind. Very friendly and had a great energy. Will definitely look for him again when we come in next.<//Text>

The sales staff is very well informed. friendly and helpful.  There is no pressure--more of a feeling to genuinely help us search out the right product for our needs.  Our delivery went very well and efficiently.  We bought a sofa sleeper with an air mattress.  The delivery men set it up for us and explained how the mattress works by demonstrating it to us.  We are very pleased with our purchase and would happily go back to the store when needed.  We would definitely recommend this store to others!< /review>

I had already visited the store a few months back. When I was ready I went to check out a few other stores and I didn’t like what they had. I didn’t even think about it twice I already knew what I wanted. When I walked in the store I walked over to the couch I walked and took a seat. The rest was a wrap. Thanks Alan<//Text>

Salesman Lawrence met a need without pressure, and on delivery day, received text message notifying me delivery would be within ten minutes, and this was met. Given 4 hour window for delivery at purchase,  and truck arrived within half hour of the delivery window. Assembled by Octavio and Christian within the hour, no complaints. Confirmed condition of assembly with dispatch after completion.<//text>

CHEAP & DECEITFUL SALEMAKING

explicitly wanted a manual sofa. Yet was sold an electrically powered one under the impression that it was manual. Went home to only have to drive all the way back to return it. Very disappointed.</Review>

<Text>I am impressed and completely satisfied with the customer service provided by Mathis Brothers Furniture, Ontario, CA.
Jason Sheridan the Sales Associate was professional, and very helpful.  I will definitely seek him out for any future furniture purchases.  The Delivery Team was exceptional!  They were careful with my furniture (from truck to inside my family room).  The team was professional, friendly, and efficient.  Additionally, I love the sectional and high quality of the fabric and construction.  No complaints only applaudes!</Text>< Pics>

The selection here is great, and the staff are amazing.  I was there for 30 minutes and I was offered help by 8 different people.  8.  Including the manager himself.  I got excellent recommendations and learned a lot about furniture from talking to the representatives.  I didn't feel like they were trying to make a sale off of me either, just help me find what I was looking for.  I will be coming back in the future for additional purchases.< /text>

< review>
At first everything was great. However, later I realized I had been told false information. Andrea made it seem like by purchasing the $69.99 platinum membership that my furniture would be delivered and assembled, plus I would be getting 4% cash back. Later after I paid, she informed me it isn’t cash back, but 4% back in points. She acted like it was the same thing as the $99.99 delivery fee except you actually get more for less. This of course is not true, as I realized after the fact, days later, that my furniture would be left at the lobby of my apartment building and not be assembled for me. Andrea saw me, and knew good and well that there was no way I could carry and assemble heavy furniture up 4 floors. It makes no sense that she wouldn’t be upfront about the membership only getting you threshold delivery when I would have paid the full delivery fee to have it assembled. She also made it as if I would be getting my box spring for $100, but since it was a king, she failed to add two box springs. She only put one. Luckily the delivery driver recognized this and fixed the issue for me. Andrea’s failure to convey the proper information regarding my purchase is what will keep me from returning to Mathis Brothers in the future. That and the customer service when I called making it my fault and mansplaining to me that it states on my receipt that it would be a threshold delivery and not assembly. Just because it’s on the receipt does not mean that the sales person did their job adequately explaining what you are paying for. The only reason I decided to give 2 stars instead of 1 is because the delivery guys were so great and professional. Mark was sure to make sure all of my needs were met, and even helped me arrange my furniture in the room as efficiently as possible. When a rail was smashed, he was very upfront and was sure to get it exchanged for me as quickly as possible. Mathis should really consider doing some proper sales training for their employees. As the faces of the company, they should be doing everything to keep customers and not just make a sale in the moment.</review>

The salesman was so helpful. The place is so big i could have spent all day. But, with the salesmans help we found what we were wanted oretty fast. He showed us our opinions then stepped away. He kept close by and when we made our decision he was ready to help. Great service and so much to choose from. I am glad we made the hour drive.< /text>

<review>I was offered 3 chair styles in the same fabric as my sofa. The style came wrong after 8 weeks of waiting.  Then they proceeded to tell me there was only one chair style that came with that sofa.  I asked them why then, did they offer me three styles shown to me on paper, I picked one and it is not the one that came.  The  said too bad. You signed for it. Of course I signed. You can’t complete the order unless you sign.   I asked them to make me the correct style or take the chair back for refund and and they would not do either.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!

<Review>Avoid if possible. We waited for 3 months for our furniture. 2 out of 3 furniture got delivered. We are still waiting on the missing item. We had to call and ask. MARIA in customer service was horrible. Daniella in delivery was horrible. No one knew anything. I asked for the floor manager and then the manager to call. Both are still MIA as of today.

Finally got a call of "we will find out and call you back." Keep in mind, all of this happened on September 15. Current date, September 26. With that time frame you would think I will get a call explaining what happened, and what's the next step.  But the call ended with "let me find out what happened and call you back." I'm not the least bit surprised that I didnt get a call back.  Are negative stars possible?
We spent $15,000 at this store. 3 months and counting, we have no idea what happened to our $8000 china cabinet.

I went ahead and emailed the suggested email below. Let's see if someone can give me straight answers.

Saturday, Sept 28. Zero phone call, zero email.

Sunday Sept 29. No phone call, and no email.

Monday, Sept 30. Jennifer "Manager" called. Sadly, this the manager that refuses to take responsibility regarding what happened. To her, everyone at her company "did everything" she possibly can.

Sad. Horrible. Be warned before you shop here. Extremely poor execution.  The problem starts with upper level management and filters down to the front-line people. Jennifer is no exception.< /Review>< pics>

< Review>
I’m giving 4 out of 5 because when we picked up our sofa and drove home , we were setting it up in living room and saw that two important bolts needed to secure the sections together were not there. That being said, it took my husband around an hour to get the new bolts and replace in hole predrilled and somewhat stripped before we could continue setting up.

The sofa is beautiful, the sales people were very friendly, maybe a few to many sales people on floor trying to help, but at least they were helping, as well as huge show room beautifully done. Would I go back? Yes! Would I recommend? Yes! Just with we wouldn’t have had missing bolts and wasted time!</Review>

On 1/15 we made a purchase and spent over an hour trying different couches. The sales person, Roya Nikdel, was very patient with us and at no time did she try to push us to make our minds up. We couldn't have been more satisfied with the experience.</review>

We bought a true leather coach almost 2 years ago for $4000. We also purchased what we thought was the “extended warranty” for $400. Turns out it only covers accidental damage. Manufacturers defects and poor craftsmanship are not covered beyond one year. We called customer service and after almost a week with no return phone call we only received canned answers and insincere empathy. We are very disappointed in the quality of the product from Mathis Brothers and service received at the Ontario, California location. Unfortunately there is nothing unique about purchasing furniture from this company.<//Text>

It’s nice and they’re super friendly, but if you buy stuff, it takes FOREVER to get delivered. I received a bed frame and have yet to receive the mattress... unhappy camper.

It was the store brand..<//text>

These guys have anything you want at a great price.  The furniture is made in USA, = quality stuff. Saved money ($700) on La-Z-Boy (as an example) compared to La-Z-Boy Gallery stores. Definitely worth going here.</Review>

To me this was exciting and fun not overwhelming.  I knew exactly what I wanted.  I paid and waited 12 weeks.  They called when it came in and scheduled delivery. The driver was on time and very professional.  I was very excited to see the finished product and hoped I had picked the right look for my house. It was way better than I expected.  It was so comfortable and fit my decor perfectly.  It was totally worth the wait.  Two thumbs up!!!< /Review>< pictures>

<Review>had to return a recliner we purchased in Oct. this has become a pain in my !! we live in AZ. so that is 300 miles each way.    the chair would turn to the right as you where reclined in it. I even checked the floor to be sure it was level (this a new home we just had build) customer service did alone us to upgrade the the chair hopeful we will have no more problems.   so far we have had to return the bed set because it was damaged . we found it after we un boxed it once again 300 miles each way. so far we had had to make 4 trips back and fourth plus paying to have the bed room set setup and taken down. It has cost us more money to purchase from you then it was worth.
can't say your customer service is any good you did replace the damaged items but no one cared about are inconvenience or time spent it's a 5 hour drive each. if you check you will see we had purchased a customer membership plan but after all the problem and trips back I requested a refund . We don't think we will be purchasing any think in the future.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

This has been the WORST expierience by far. Th customer service and the communication has been horrible. We were supposed to have our couch by Feb 14th and we did not receive it until 2/28. And that was only one peice (which was the smallest of the whole couch). Leading up to the delivery the sales rep had horrible customer service and never called us. We always had to call him and he always had a excuse as to why the couch had not arrived. We would tell the sales rep and manager we couldnt have it delivered until the evening and they would schedule it for the middle of the day. Finally a week later we got the rest of the couch so we thought and it’s still missing a peice. The manager again failed to contact us first and now we have no idea when the last peice will be delivered. I will never shop with this company again and I am very disappointed at how we were treated.</review>

Initially I had a great shopping experience.  I really enjoyed going into the store and I was always greeted warmly by the salespeople.

I had heard and was apprehensive that they only wanted to make a sale.  They were always respectful of my time when I was only "window-shopping."

When the day came that I was finally ready to make a very large multi room purchase, the sales person I was dealing with was very excited that I gave him my business.

This sales person turned out however to be very disappointing.  He was on the next visit too busy with an active customer to even check in with me.  I waited 45 minutes and he never responded to any of his three pages.  I used a nice junior salesman who was working in the clearance section.

My Mathis brother's experience only got worse when I had to wait several weeks for delivery due to a problem with billing and or shipping as they never called me to tell me that my order could be delivered.

The head Manager, Dan made thing better and took some of the sting out of the bad experience by offering to give me free shipping which I gladly accepted.

Dan still know what the customer experience means and he did go out of his way to make things right.

Dan gets five stars *****.</text>

< Review>
I was offered 3 chair styles in the same fabric as my sofa. The style came wrong after 8 weeks of waiting.  Then they proceeded to tell me there was only one chair style that came with that sofa.  I asked them why then, did they offer me three styles shown to me on paper, I picked one and it is not the one that came.  The  said too bad. You signed for it. Of course I signed. You can’t complete the order unless you sign.   I asked them to make me the correct style or take the chair back for refund and and they would not do either.
HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!!!!
Never will I shop Mathis brothers again.< /Review>

We bought a power recycling sofa and chair made by lazy boy in 2017 from mathis furniture. We bought the extended warranty that the salesman said would take care of any problems for 3 years. On November 15 my chair made a big bang when raising the foot rest and immediately  the foot rest fell down.  The next day we called Mathis brothers  and asked to have someone come and repair the chair,they said they would have to schedule someone to come out and we would receive a call,1 week later we got a call and scheduled a repairman for a Saturday and they would call with a time,well he showed up at 9 am without calling,he was here for maybe 5 minutes and said he had to order a part. We waited 10 days and did not here back so I called customer service to find out the problem and was told it could take anywhere from 6 to 10 weeks to get the part at which time I said this was unacceptable and they should provide me with a new chair,the girl I was speaking with said she would have a representative  call me as soon as she got off the other line,well 4 hours later I finally called back and got the runaround  again and finally 2 hours after that she finally called back and said that this is covered under the manufacturer's  warranty and there is nothing more they can do and I will have to wait.i think wainting anywhere from 2 to 3 months to use my chair is unacceptable  and they should replace it.</Text>

Great selection! Ranging from traditional, mid-century, modern, to pieces similar to Palm Springs mid-century chic. The sales people do not pester, or hover, but greet you & help if needed. Would recommend & will shop there again.</Text>

<review>The 2 guys delivering my furniture were very professional, respectful and quick.  The slats were missing for one of our beds and he called it in immediately and within 10 minutes or so I received a call with an apology and a delivery date for the missing slats.
This is my first time shopping at Mathis Brothers and I will definitely be back.

We had an excellent experience! I had previously went there and took a picture of a set I had to have. But fate and my husband thought otherwise...so by the time I got there they were sold out. Our Sales associate Mario quickly zoomed in on the pictire got the item number and made calls! He found my set in Indio, CA and was able to have it shipped to this store! Needless to say service like that is why we frequent Mathis brothers for all our furniture needs!< /Text>

We came because we were in the market for a couch. First we walked in and then noticed the person by the door (the sales lady) was creeping behind us and waited until we sat in one of the furniture to say anything. Seemed uninterested and like we were bothering her. After a while of us asking questions and she figured we were actually there to buy something her mood changed. Hopefully the rest of their staff is a little friendlier and personable. Second, just have it in your mind that the price you see is for sure the price you are paying. We spoke to the sales manager and he assured us they don't negotiate. That's fine that's their business model we just wont come here again. But they do have a huge selection. We ended up getting a great deal at Ashley furniture (free delivery and lowered the price)< /text>

The salesman Issa showed me excellent service. He was knowledgeable, accommodating, and listened to my needs. Issa showed me exactly what i was looking for. The movers were fast.

< Review>
I was disappointed that I purchased 2 light fixtures which needed to be picked up within 72 hours. I attempted to pick up the items twice but each time I was told that they did not have an electrician and needed to wait. The 3rd day they called stating that if the items were not picked up that day, they would place them back on the floor room, when I had already attempted to get my items 2 days in a row. After I picked up my light fixtures,  they came without light bulbs!! At least provide me with the light bulbs! I was a little disappointed!< /Review>

Your Customer Service  is Gold Star. I should know working for Quality Assurance Service BUREAU . Our Floor Service Person was Gus. He was so helpful . He greeted us with a warm friendly smile. And did not pressure us in a sale. He was  OUTSTANDING. The whole experience was 5 Star Top Quality. I purchased a Recliner. I am very happy  with my Recliner. I will be watching my Dodgers win again and this time the World Series.  I will be returning to purchase more furniture in the future. I will recommend your establishment  to my friends.</text>

Unbeatable selection at a fair price, and with exceptional customer service. A furniture store like they used to have but have all but disappeared, with a few exceptions, like Mathis Brothers. Well worth the drive.</Review>

<text>I recently purchased an adjustable bed from Mathis Brothers.
Doug Silverstone was my sales person and did a very professional job. His knowledge and friendly approach to this purchase was great.
My only concern was with the delivery. I never received notification the day before the delivery as to the time window for the delivery. I ended up calling the store. The bed did arrive and I'm happy, so far, with the purchase.</text>< Pictures>

<text>Although prices are good, the delivery charge was a shock! Sure, every furniture store has a delivery charge, but I've never been charged an ADDITIONAL 3% of sale added! When a customer's order is $3000.00+, delivery should be free or $150 max. Not very happy about that :-(< /text>< Pictures>

The store is huge with two floors.  The delivery of our furniture was just as good as the store experience.  The night before, they emailed me the time frame they expected to deliver.  On the day of delivery, I received a phone when they were about 20 minutes away.  They assembled the furniture quickly and with no mess other than some small pieces of lint.  I would shop here again and recommend this furniture store to everyone.<//text>< pictures>

Initially I had a great shopping experience.  I really enjoyed going into the store and I was always greeted warmly by the salespeople.

I had heard and was apprehensive that they only wanted to make a sale.  They were always respectful of my time when I was only "window-shopping."

When the day came that I was finally ready to make a very large multi room purchase, the sales person I was dealing with was very excited that I gave him my business.

This sales person turned out however to be very disappointing.  He was on the next visit too busy with an active customer to even check in with me.  I waited 45 minutes and he never responded to any of his three pages.  I used a nice junior salesman who was working in the clearance section.

My Mathis brother's experience only got worse when I had to wait several weeks for delivery due to a problem with billing and or shipping as they never called me to tell me that my order could be delivered.

The head Manager, Dan made thing better and took some of the sting out of the bad experience by offering to give me free shipping which I gladly accepted.

Dan still know what the customer experience means and he did go out of his way to make things right.

Dan gets five stars *****.<//Review>

<review>My wife and I came into your Ontario store on 11/18/18 looking for a recliner to match our sofa.
We were greeted by Jason Sheridan who asked if we needed help.
After our horrible experience at your competitor Jerome's minutes before, I thought let's give him a chance.
He was extremely professional and enthusiastic about making sure we found what we were looking for.
His courteous and non-pressure manner really helped us to decide on a recliner.
Because of him, we decided to purchase 2 recliners!
Thanks again Jason and Mathis Brothers for having an employee that really made this buying process so easy!</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1543852261562, 'text': 'We are thrilled to read Jason did such a wonderful job assisting you!

I did not make this purchase. It was a fraudulent purchase charged to my account. I had to contact my bank to cancel my card. I am very upset. How could this happen? I am through with Mathis Brothers.<//Review>

My wife and I came into your Ontario store on 11/18/18 looking for a recliner to match our sofa.
We were greeted by Jason Sheridan who asked if we needed help.
After our horrible experience at your competitor Jerome's minutes before, I thought let's give him a chance.
He was extremely professional and enthusiastic about making sure we found what we were looking for.
His courteous and non-pressure manner really helped us to decide on a recliner.
Because of him, we decided to purchase 2 recliners!
Thanks again Jason and Mathis Brothers for having an employee that really made this buying process so easy!< /review>

<review>First of all sorry for the long review, but it was very frustrating FYI check your receipts carefully! We purchased a sectional with recliners, while we were shopping the salesman said there was an extra module in the clearance that someone had returned. At first, he did not tell us the piece was not working. So when we asked then they were honest and said no it does not work, but hey thought it was the switch not the motor, but for $50dollars why not buy the extra piece and try to fix it. So upon check out the cashier messed up our total 3x, we spent over 30 minutes trying to get the total; no offense but she was using the calculator and her 3inch nails kept pushing the wrong keys and she kept starting over. Anyways, that was not the end as we were driving home I looked over the receipt again and it was still wrong. So I called and they fixed it. When the sectional was delivered one piece was not working (and not the one we bought) it kept clicking so we called them the next day they offered to exchange it. At this point I became skeptical about this couch considering there was a piece in the clearance not working and now our brand new piece. Plus there is no warranty on the motor. So I asked if I could return it for the main  reason that I no longer felt secure that I was getting something that would last me long. Also I was not satisfied with the appearance of the sectional in our living room. They said they would take it back, but I would have to get something equal or greater value or else I  would be charged the restocking fee and pick up fee. Mind you this furniture had been in my home less than 24hrs.  So we purchased a different set and once again the cashier was a disaster. No lie she gave me 4 different totals. The totals ranged from a $900 dollar to $330 in difference. They kept trying to tax me twice and charge me restocking fee.  She  finally got it right after having to confirm with a supervisor.  The cashier problem did not end there. The salesman kept telling my husband about the "great" furniture protection plan, so they said we could add it before it was delivered. So my husband called the night before delivery and once again he was told he would have to pay more than they originally told us, than they placed him on hold for over 25 minutes so he hung up.  They called me after my husband hung up and their story was that the protection plan would now be $290, someone else had told my husband it was over  $300. We were over all the problems and just wanted the furniture delivered so we opted out of the plan.  Now delivery time was not as promised it was a day later and the time of arrival was 2hrs later than promised. We finally got our couches and they are nice. What a headache,  I expect if you spend over $3,000 you should at least come out a little more satisfied and with a happier story. Buyer beware and pay attention to the total on your receipts, especially if you are financing with them.</review><Resp>{'time': 1542640827718, 'text': 'Hi Silvia- We apologize about the multiple issues you experienced with this purchase.

<Review>Had an amazing gal that took us to clearance on our request! Cecelia Brown!
She knew her job so well that she was able to match the couch we loved in one clearance section to a couch in another clearance room! We would have never put 2 and 2 together! She was courteous and sweet and made our shopping time leisurely and conformed only to us!
Our delivery guys were right on time and super kind and courteous! I will only go to Mathis Brothers for ANY furniture needs. We were recommended by friends whom recently bought a beautiful cornered couch ens-amble! Your outfit rocks!!!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

We went to Mathis Brothers in Ontario, CA which is about an hour away from our house to see if there was anything different from the normal furniture stores in our area (Temecula, CA).  We were fortunate to hook up with the sales person Ms. Priscilla Yam.  Priscilla took very good care of us.  We didn't know exactly what style of furniture we were looking for, just that we wanted a change.  She is/was extremely patient as we changed our minds several times.  She accommodated our delivery and return once the furniture got to the house and wasn't quite what we wanted once it got in our house.  She spent time sending us photos of furniture she thought would go well with our decor so we could see it before making the long trip out there.  She did this time and time again until we finally locked in with the style of furniture to fit our styled.  She is/was amazing.  Never pushy, just a very good listener and flexible.  We ended up spending thousands of dollars on almost every room in our house and it turned out amazing.  We are extremely pleased with the quality of furniture and personal yet professional care we received from Ms. Priscilla Yam.  She truly made our Mathis Brothers experience great!  We'd definitely refer our friends and family to Mathis Brothers and Priscilla Yam.< /review>

Our Sales Associate, Van Mai, was very patient with my elderly mother and her friend. He led them to each of the departments they were interested in and did it at a pace that was comfortable for them. He did not push them into buying something they were not interested in but allowed them to weigh the pros and cons, walk back and forth between their favorite items and answer all their questions.
My mother was very pleased that she did not feel pressured into making her purchase. On top of that, Van stayed longer than his scheduled time to take care of them.
The delivery went smoothly. We received a two hour window the day before the delivery and the driver called us ten minutes out. They were polite, careful and quick.
All in all, I would recommend Mathis Brothers to anyone who asked. I wish we had one in Ohio!< /Review>

Big store! Very neutral colored store in general. Too much brown for me. But interesting once,  if you're not looking for anything in particular. If you're in need of furnishings go there.<//Text>

Very pleased with Armando's  patience , warmth, and assistance regarding information, tips, and suggestions about the items we purchased.

A pillow on display however punctured my wife's finger. A manager was called who made an incident report and apologized then left right away. It wasn't a big deal but maybe the manager should have shown more sympathy by at least offering a little credit or discount just to minimize the impact of the incident and for the sake of protecting the company's reputation.

I am part of  the managing team in our retail company and I've seen a lot of incidents
like this and we tried our best to make our customer, safe and happy.

I am about to give 5 stars for Armando's sake but because of the handling of my wife's incident by management I decided to give only 3 stars.</text>

The sales person and delivery drivers were exceptional, product quality was poor at best and after several attempts to deliver a non defective product the customer service people attempted a switch and bait procedure that has still left us with a defective product after being inconvenienced multiple times and still no resolve on picking up the product or refund. When calling the store we are just put on hold for long periods of time and then told they will talk to a customer service manager who will call us back and no one ever calls. There lack of concern for the post purchase experience is appalling and reprehensible.< /Text>

I called the 800 telephone number and spoke to a polite customer service representative.  She explained the credit clearance process to me.

I chose a special order upholstery.  I was able to afford the the one third amount of the total purchase as the down payment.  The chairs would be delivered in 8-12 weeks.  My friend and I were in and out of the store in less than one hour.  I was notified when the chairs were ready for delivery.  The delivery men were polite.  They moved my old chairs outside, put the recliner pieces together and placed them in the room, at my direction.  The chairs are comfortable beyond my expectations and are relieving my knee and back discomfort.  I am a happy customer of Mathis Brothers Furniture.< /text>< resp>

<Review>Was searching for a a power recliner with everything usb ports, cup holders, table, basically a reclining theater chair. Visited all of Mathis Brothers competitors in the area. Mathis Brothers by far had the fairest prices and the best variety! Had it  it delivered which was a breeze very friendly installers. Mathis Brothers is so big in Ontario California. You will be able to find anything you need there. I would recommend Mathis Brothers to anyone who is looking for any kind of furniture. This chair is well made and very comfortable.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

There are 3 or 4 representatives standing in the main entrance and none of them greeted us when we walked in. It’s a simple gesture that makes a big difference for first time customers like me. After few minutes, Jim walked by and offered assistance. He made us feel welcomed and patiently waited until we made our decision. Our items were delivered on time in prestine condition. 5 stars for Jim & the delivery crew.<//Text>

<Text>Really enjoyed our experience at MB; especially compared to other stores. They were honest, helpful and sincere. Our salesman Richard was one of a kind. Took a bit for the pieces to arrive from the warehouse but once they came in they were scheduled for delivery. The delivery was on time! The team was fast, careful, and clean. Within 20 min our brand new bedroom was set up and ready to be settled in.
I would certainly do more business with MB and have already referred to several freinds.</Text>< Pictures>

< review>
I've referred Mathis Brothers to my clients more times than I can count, but last week they received my last referral.
I have a client moving into an assisted living and the furniture was supposed to be delivered last Friday.  Mathis Brothers brought the wrong size beds.  They were supposed to call the family Friday night to verify the size of the bed and deliver on Saturday.
Well, Monday morning I get to work and there's nothing and we're on our way to pick this clients up with no furniture in their room.  I call the family and ask what happened with the furniture and they tell me they NEVER received a call on Friday from Mathis. So, Mathis Brothers totally messed up.  While I understand mistakes happen you would think that when we call Mathis Brothers that they will deliver the furniture on Monday since it was there mistake.   After multiple calls they tell us they can't deliver until Tuesday after 4:30pm.   So now these poor people have to stay in a nursing home for 3 extra days because Mathis Brothers can't get it together.
I will NEVER refer to them again and I will discourage ANY client for ever shopping there again.
THANKS FOR NOTHING MATHIS BROTHERS !!!!!< /review>

< Review>
Of course the sales people are always nice Because they want their commission. The experience with the sales representative was OK. After they took my money for a custom order sofa set, it took 4 weeks to get delivered to their Warehouse, drove two hours to pick up the furniture only to discover the sofa was damaged. They offered a discount if I took the sofa as is. I refused. They suggested I keep the sofa as a loaner, due to the fact I had to wait another 4 weeks for the new one.. I waited, my sales rep called me to tell me my sofa was in and they would deliver it. Delivery time was 4:30-6:30. The delivery guys called me at 3:40 and told me he would be their in 20 min... I explained to him that my delivery time was at 4:30. He said he would wait 15 min. I got to my neighborhood at 4:38, called him. No answer.. saw a Mathis delivery truck making a u turn, I pulled up next to him and told him, I just called you.  He said he rescheduled the delivery for another day, I need to call customer service. At this point he was 1.5 miles from my house and customers have a 15 min grace period is what he told me on the phone... Mathis Brothers furniture will never get my business again! I spent $3000.00 on furniture in one night! I will be happy to take my money and business elsewhere. It’s been a Nightmare trying to get my furniture!< /Review>

<review>I've referred Mathis Brothers to my clients more times than I can count, but last week they received my last referral.
I have a client moving into an assisted living and the furniture was supposed to be delivered last Friday.  Mathis Brothers brought the wrong size beds.  They were supposed to call the family Friday night to verify the size of the bed and deliver on Saturday.
Well, Monday morning I get to work and there's nothing and we're on our way to pick this clients up with no furniture in their room.  I call the family and ask what happened with the furniture and they tell me they NEVER received a call on Friday from Mathis. So, Mathis Brothers totally messed up.  While I understand mistakes happen you would think that when we call Mathis Brothers that they will deliver the furniture on Monday since it was there mistake.   After multiple calls they tell us they can't deliver until Tuesday after 4:30pm.   So now these poor people have to stay in a nursing home for 3 extra days because Mathis Brothers can't get it together.
I will NEVER refer to them again and I will discourage ANY client for ever shopping there again.
THANKS FOR NOTHING MATHIS BROTHERS !!!!!</review>< user>

We purchased the furniture and was told not in stock. It will be 5 days to receive, we agree. After the 5 days they said it would another 10 days, " not happy customer " Mathisbrothers advertise and claims to have all in stock !not true! To make matters worse the Damn furniture had to be assembled, and we were never informed beforehand. I don't think I'll be buying from Mathisbloopers anymore!!!</review>

<Text>Our Sales Associate, Van Mai, was very patient with my elderly mother and her friend. He led them to each of the departments they were interested in and did it at a pace that was comfortable for them. He did not push them into buying something they were not interested in but allowed them to weigh the pros and cons, walk back and forth between their favorite items and answer all their questions.
My mother was very pleased that she did not feel pressured into making her purchase. On top of that, Van stayed longer than his scheduled time to take care of them.
The delivery went smoothly. We received a two hour window the day before the delivery and the driver called us ten minutes out. They were polite, careful and quick.
All in all, I would recommend Mathis Brothers to anyone who asked. I wish we had one in Ohio!< /Text><Time>1531424760101</Time><userid>112508799890549144282< /userid>< Pictures>

<gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131</gmap_id><review>Desiring against spending countless hours traversing from one imitation furniture store to the next I elected upon saving us both the headache & going DIRECTLY to the source.

Ya' see...., most places sell furniture in bulk (sofa, 2 end tables, an area rug,...blah blah blahhhh) & then upcharge when securing payment for their price of delivery.....even if you're just a mile or two away & ain't nobody got time for added lumbar struggles!

"Reclining" on Inland Empire Blvd., this 45,000 sq. ft. sofa, sectional & EVERYTHING in the middle "mausoleum" is the largest of its kind around & facilitates around the mantra, "if we ain't got it, then you either don't need it OR it simply doesn't diddly' darned exist!"

Wow. Such confidence.

Driving out just a few days ago, we were greeted by an ear-to-ear smiling "Orie O."

(Yup, that's REALLY her name)

Providing us with the royal tour did I wish I'd worn more comfortable shoes. Man. These guys have EVERYTHING!

From sofas, to sectionals, to love seats to dining sets down to bedroom furniture, mirrors, lighting & area rugs.

Not only do they price match by 200% (see the attached photo from their website) but they've got brand upon brand to pretty much appease everyone; from the big ballers & shot callers to those with lint balls & last year's casino vouchers aligning their pocketbook!

Yazzzzzz!

There was NO PRESSURE to purchase any undesired side items that we neither needed nor wanted.

Perhaps the ONLY pressure that we actually observed was very well wafted by way of our newfound sales driven compadre, who'd randomly pop up from outta' nowhere like that weird neighbor you shut your blinds on!

*~~~*~~~*~~~*

"I ALWAYS feel likkkke... SOMEBODY'S wattttching meeeee!"

*~~~*~~~*~~~*

Similar to the flatulence derived upon by consuming dairy products, I wish I'd downed a tray of gouda beforehand just to better enable us to shop in peace!

*** "I'm not going to follow you guys around. I'll leave you to explore the store on your own." ***

Then, whyyyyyy are you still there lurking within the trenches like a 5 o'clock shadow, Craigggg???!

So, why 3 stars as opposed to 5, Kenny?

Well grab hold of your bar stools and I'll tell you!

Upon finalizing our order of 2 Simon Li sofas we proceeded to purchase 2 (of 6 total) bar stools to match up with our recently installed hardwood.

No sense in purchasing them all at once when there's no guarantee they're going to even look right, right?

Requesting they be unwrapped & assembled as suggested REPEATEDLY by this Orie, we paid &-

* GET THIS...

....became INSTANTLY enlightened by way of the store manager that THEY DON'T ASSEMBLE FURNITURE WITHIN THE AFTERNOONS (because there's no one there to do it) & that this process requires "prior approval" from Mgmt as is.

*** Whacha' say, whacha' say now?

Soooooo, you mean to tell me that you've STALKED us for the better portion of 2 hours w/o even offering us dinner & a movie and didn't so much as perform a simple fact check PRIOR to "checking us out"?

Way to go guys!

You made the sell. Was it worth it?!!

If I hadn't known better, I'd swear we'd entered Bass Pro Shops because certainly this BLATANT "bait & switch" couldn't possibly be sold along with the stain guard & extended warranties by way of dissa' here furniture store!

But I ain't done!

We were then driven to retrieve said boxes from a LESS THAN STELLAR pick up/delivery crew (opposite side of the store) whereas we returned home just to "channel" IKEA through the usage of Allen wrenches, boxed wine & caption-less instructional photos.

Smfh.

This is blatant b/s & no doubt will we be returning these stools like an unwanted box of expired holiday stuffing!

If anything, I'm going to humbly advocate Orie O. opt for a prompt pseudonym swap.

No doubt, after we dished out $1,000's while viewing her visibly "write a check w/ her mouth that her behind clearly could NOT cash", upon succumbing to our impromptu DIY session, how about going with "Nabisco", darling?

Caus' dealing with you,.....I betcha' bite a "gyp"!</review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Of course the sales people are always nice Because they want their commission. The experience with the sales representative was OK. After they took my money for a custom order sofa set, it took 4 weeks to get delivered to their Warehouse, drove two hours to pick up the furniture only to discover the sofa was damaged. They offered a discount if I took the sofa as is. I refused. They suggested I keep the sofa as a loaner, due to the fact I had to wait another 4 weeks for the new one.. I waited, my sales rep called me to tell me my sofa was in and they would deliver it. Delivery time was 4:30-6:30. The delivery guys called me at 3:40 and told me he would be their in 20 min... I explained to him that my delivery time was at 4:30. He said he would wait 15 min. I got to my neighborhood at 4:38, called him. No answer.. saw a Mathis delivery truck making a u turn, I pulled up next to him and told him, I just called you.  He said he rescheduled the delivery for another day, I need to call customer service. At this point he was 1.5 miles from my house and customers have a 15 min grace period is what he told me on the phone... Mathis Brothers furniture will never get my business again! I spent $3000.00 on furniture in one night! I will be happy to take my money and business elsewhere. It’s been a Nightmare trying to get my furniture!<//review>

I went in looking for a new bedroom furniture and I found the perfect set! Great customer service, no one looming over my shoulder or constantly asking if I needed help but someone was always close by if I did have a question. Overall it was a great experience. Fair prices, good customer service and quality furniture.<//text>

After shopping for months and months we by chance ended up at Mathis Bros in Ontario,Ca while simply looking for a headboard to go with a bed we had ordered someplace else..  So, We were greeted by a salesperson named Kamm who immediately assessed why we came in and what we might be interested in seeing in the store.  Kamm showed us we could get more for our money and better quality furniture at that from Mathis Bros!!  So, we canceled an order from another store and we bought evrrything at Mathis. We  are veey pleased with our new bedroom set and we even found a special chair that my husband had been looking everywhere for !!  So, we are happy, happy campers. And everything looks beautiful and we look our Aireloom mattress! We highly recommend Mathis Brothers! I also highly recommend Kamm as a great salesperson!  We will diffinately shop herr again !!<//Text>

I went to Mathis brothers to buy a floor lamp the girl that helped me name is Sarina Berry she did a fantastic job but when it came time to do the pick up the guys over told me they couldn't brake down the lamp when they told Sarina they could if Sarina was getting commission off the sale she didn't get it cause I did a return and I'm still waiting on my money to be returned back into my bank account. It's a shame if Sarina didn't get the commission that's sad cause she went above and beyond to help me get what I wanted keep up the excellent job Sarina.</Review>

Sales person asked what we were interested in then showed me  number of selections.  I spotted a side table (which was not on my purchase list) and ended up buying it as well as a recliner that I was originally interested in. The saleman made all the arrangements for delivery. The delivery men were on time, actually a few minutes early, were very polite and efficient.  Overall a very pleasant experience.< /Review>

I buy most of my furniture from Mathis Bros.  Why?  Because the quality is the absolute best at an affordable price.  The customer service is superb!  Once you decide upon what you want, you can be on your way in minutes.  The loading dock is not only fast, they are friendly and extremely courteous.</text>

Our Sales Associate, Van Mai, was very patient with my elderly mother and her friend. He led them to each of the departments they were interested in and did it at a pace that was comfortable for them. He did not push them into buying something they were not interested in but allowed them to weigh the pros and cons, walk back and forth between their favorite items and answer all their questions.
My mother was very pleased that she did not feel pressured into making her purchase. On top of that, Van stayed longer than his scheduled time to take care of them.
The delivery went smoothly. We received a two hour window the day before the delivery and the driver called us ten minutes out. They were polite, careful and quick.
All in all, I would recommend Mathis Brothers to anyone who asked. I wish we had one in Ohio!< /Text>

They were extremely polite, helpful, informative, friendly, and go out  of their way to help you people at any furniture store I have ever been to. The movers were just as well. Very efficient and punctual. They truly also showed great care about the well being of my new furniture, i.e. how it was moved in as to cause no damage and it's placement.

<Time>1474320427009</Time><review>The selection and staff are really nice.  I don't think there is another store where you can see so much of an assortment from low end to high end.  Seeing the furniture in completed decorated areas makes it easier to see how it looks in a home environment.  That being said, I had difficulty getting all of my furniture.  My leather couches were suppose to be delivered in a week but, both pieces arrived at different times and it took over 45days.  The coffee tables were suppose to arrive in 8 weeks.  After two changes of delivery and another date given, I called the manufacturer and found out the set has been discontinued and none were being shipped.  Customer service did send me three gift cards for the inconvenience which I appreciated.  I have shopped there since but, would only buy items that were in stock.  I think that someone should be watching the items on order, instead of just giving out new delivery dates on items that would never arrive.  MB did refund my $1487 for the discontinued coffee table.  Delivery was also very professional.</review><Rating>5< /Rating>< user_name>

We were impressed with the variety of sofas that we saw and our salesperson was great. We knew what we wanted and the sale did not take long. Delivery was next day which we liked. Set up was quick. We would highly recommend Mathis Bros!</Review>

One of the chairs is missing the plastic (tack that goes on the bottom of the chair). It is not stable, it wiggles when we sit on it.</review>

Our salesman, Eric Serda, was very professional, and helpful. He went the extra mile to find our couch, which wasn't in stock at the time. He found one, and instead of waiting 2 weeks for delivery,  we got our whole living room set in 5 days. The delivery crew, was efficient, and very courteous. They were on time, and made quick work. Great experience,  would recommend 100 %.< /Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>We were looking for for a couple of reclining chairs for a while. We've been to Jerome's, Living Spaces and finally Mathis Brothers. We would rate them as follows:  #1 MB - #2 LS  - #3 Jerome's. Mathis Bros has the largest and best selection with the quality being the highest of all. Sure you save a few bucks at the others but not that much. If  getting what you pay for matters to you . . .  shop at Mathis Bros :)< /review>< pictures>

<rating>5</rating><review>My wife and I had an excellent experience shopping with Mathis Brothers. Jabbir was extremely helpful with the purchase of our new couches. He was very knowledgeable about the products and was able to answer all of our questions. Jabbir was able to complete our transaction quickly and accurately. When he found that the specific couches that we wanted we're not in stock he was upfront and gave us a two week window of when they would be back in stock. To our surprise it only took 6 day for our new couches to be delivered. The men that delivered the couches  were polite and punctual. I will definitely be doing business with Mathis Brothers in the future.

Thank you,<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Wow! What a variety of home furnishings and great quality.  My wife received excellent help from  one of the store Managers, Chris and floor customer service rep, Rodney who worked with me in purchasing some counter stools for a price that not only fit my budget, but was surprising delivered the next day.  The company excels at great customer service, the delivery company was professional, they arrived when they said they would arrive, they assembled and delivered our counter stools promptly and without being damage.  We plan on returning to Mathis Brothers Furniture to shop for additional home furnishings and have recommended this place to both friends and relatives.  Great to know there are still places around that care about the quality of service as well as their products.  Keep up the great work Mathis Brothers!!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Salesperson Heather was very friendly and helpful.  The store had a huge selection of recliners.  There was no sales pressure or anyone pushing us to buy.  The entire purchase was smooth and pleasant.  We will definitely go to Heather if we purchase more.  We highly recommend her and this store.</Text>

I LOVE THIS FURNITURE STORE! I came here to look for furniture after moving to California from Georgia. The selections and styles were endless and Orie Innabi was so helpful when it came time to pick out my furniture. She was knowledgable, educated, and really listened to my specific needs while taking my style into consideration. Not once did I feel like I was being pushed or hovered over. ALSO, she was able to get my furniture delivered the next day (a Saturday) which was incredibly convenient. I will definitely be back to this place!< /review>

Best experience ever.  Aside from the most friendly and knowledgeable sales person, Cecilia Brown, the delivery part of our experience was very exciting.  Not only because of our beautiful quality couches but the service that was provided was very satisfying.  We were notified 45 minutes before arriving and they delivered the furniture with the utmost care and were 10 minutes earlier than the delivery window!! When does that happen, right...</review>

We visited the store in search of a sofa recliner. Billy was our showroom floor person and he was so kind, helpful, and patient with us. He explained the warranty information to us very clearly, showed us many couches that fit our criteria, and was excellent in answering our many questions. Though we didn’t buy a sofa today, when I come back to Mathis Brothers, I will definitely look for him again.<//review>

We had a great experience as we found the furniture we wanted quickly and were assisted by Jake Gutierrez. The furniture was delivered the next day.
Our only suggestion would be to offer removal of furniture that is being replaced by the purchase. There would likely be an extra charge but truly become a one-stop shop.<//review>

Purchased lawn and patio furniture for my new home. Cecilia has been my salesperson of choice for many of my purchases in the past and will be on the future. The price was very competitive and the stock was available and Cecelia was able to link the delivery to an exchange that was already scheduled.  All of the furniture arrived as scheduled and we will be enjoying them this weekend with family. Thank you Cecilia and Mathis Brothers for great customer service.

<text>I left the store thrilled with the service I received from Scott.
I have a small and awkward L shaped living room. I bought a loveseat, matching chair, odd chair, end table and 4 dining room chairs. Scott and I went back and forth about the the matching chair and in the end I decided to add the chair to my order. Scott and I went directly to choosing an upholstery  for the specially ordered chair. Scott did not put the matching chair on the order and I did not go over the order before I paid. At delivery I realized our error. I called Scott, he wrote up the order and ask management to deliver the chair with no additional delivery charge. They refused this customer service and I had to pay another $90.00. Scott is good please ask for him. Do not expect anything extra, called customer service, from management. At both deliveries the men were very nice and helpful. It appears a 5 star will get you a reply more often then a less stellar review.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

Wasn't in the store for 5 minutes and boom, sales person globs on to try and make a sale.  We informed him that we were just looking to see what couches were out there and how much is from China.  So the sales person followed is around, showed us some models, disparaged La-Z-Boy product, and when asked why he could only give lame sweeping cliche nonsense as to why that product was lacking to the competition. This store is huge, lots of furniture and related products to choose from.  The staff is helpful but this visit the sales guy was a little overzealous and for that reason we left which is a shame as this company's history would indicate that they don't operate like this.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>For us, this is the first furniture place who really guarranty/warranty their product! We purchased an Eco mattress 5 years ago with 25 years  warranty.  The middle of the mattress has over half an inch body indentation.  Claim was quick, easy and everyone we encountered  were all very helpful, friendly, and professional! We are happy with our new mattress! We highly recommend this place!

Great job!

Thanks Mathis Bros!</Review>< time>

We have bought furniture for 2 bedrooms, den, and this time living room from Mathis Bros. Each time very pleased with quality, brand selection choices, delivery and price. The sales people are not pushy just help you zero in on what fits your style, taste and budget. They offer a no interest option if paid in 12 months. Overall a happy repeat customer.<//Review>

<Review>Great customer Service to say the least! I cannot say when was the last time we received such great service, Rosemary has a great personality and treated us as she had known us forever. If you are in the market for some new furniture head on over to Mathis Brothers and buy it there, we are definitely going back for our new mattress, bedroom-set, and dining table. Thank you Rosemary it was an outstanding experience.<//Review>< Rating>

Good experience the sales lady Reyda was very helpful. We had a little problem which she readily fix for us. After picking up our furniture n trying to put it together we realized we were missing all the screws we contacted her n she was able to arrange for us to pick up another table. Even though it took some time we have our beautiful dining set at home. Thank you</text>

Absolutely terrible experience. I called in by phone because they told me I could do that to pay off a sectional  I had ordered and  they ended up charging me over $1000 twice. They held it in my account for five days and I did not have access to my money. I had to call five times each day and every time I spoke to somebody nobody seem to care and they just kept giving me the runaround telling me that they were going to wait for corporate to confirm.  I am very surprised at the Customer Service that has been received. Really nobody has taken care of anything and everything I called they keep telling me they’re going to call me by the end of the day and of course nothing happens . Will never buy again from here and will tell all of my friends and acquaintances the same and about my Horrible  experience<//Review>

We actually ordered the table online and trusted our sales representatives when they told us that this company had a good reputation. We were so happy when our table arrived. Our delivery men were very careful in placing the table in the kitchen. They covered the floor as they assembled the pedestals. We had such a great experience that we went back a couple of weeks later and purchased a sofa and loveseat!  Mathis Brothers is our new furniture store!!<//Review>< pictures>

Convenient store, large supply and variety of sofa's in all colors. Sales associate not pushy, but very relaxed let us look at whole store and even the famous clearance departments. Delivery was right on time and courteous drivers called within a half hour window delivery time. Set furniture up how we wanted it. Been purchasing from them for years now.</Text>

We have purchased furniture from this store previously.  The store is very clean, great showrooms and good selection.   Recently, we purchased some items that were defective.  When I called the store for the replacement, the person was nice and said they would replace the item with no problems. We had quite an experience just getting the store to update our new address in their system  which I addressed with the sales person at the time of the purchase. A month later, we finally get the replacement piece of furniture and it turns out the new unit is worse than the one it replaced. We are at the point of returning all of the furniture we purchased.  We are very disappointed with our latest shopping experience at this store.

I called the store 2 days ago, left a message for the store manager with my order number, I have yet to hear from anyone with Mathis Brothers.  While the social media rep responded to my review, it appears that no one from the store has taken the initiative to resolve the matter.  Perhaps the social media repsonse is the way say they are responsive.  I understand it might be a busy time of the year but how long does one have to wait to get things resolved?< /review>

Brandon De Armas provided excellent customer service. He was helpful, gave opinions, apologized when he had to step away and most of all, he wasn’t intrusive of our space when we needed to discuss anything in private. Recommend him highly!</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>We recently relocated near the Ontario area, and were in need of some new furniture to go with the new home. As we walked into Mathis Brothers we were professionally greeted with a big smile by a service rep from Rickie Hill. After speaking with Rickie, we felt his heart warm honesty and he directed us to the perfect dining room table with matching beautiful chairs. Aftrr several visits Rickie placed our order, and actually called us prior to its delivery. Each time we went into this store Rickie was ready to assist with ideas. Today we went to shop for more furniture,  only to be sadly updated that our friend Rickie had suddenly passed away. This man was kind, humble and spoke about retiring soon to travel. On behalf of my wife and I we would like to express our sympathy and condolences to the his family and your store employees.  We will miss his smile and our friendly conversations about travelling!!
Thank you Mathis Brothers, and God bless you Rickie Hill</Review>< Pics>

I had a good experience with the service Mathis Brothers provide. The quality of the furniture is very good  and the price is very good. the only down side to my experience was that there was a mix up on my order in which I was told that the items that I order were in the warehouse but I found out after the delivery truck delivered only a part of my order and if I had not followed up by calling them I would not have found out about the mix up. However the customer service is very good.</text>

I have always had great service when buying from Mathis Brothers in Ontario and I have bought 5 different items. This time I bought a mattress and my sales person Gus was very nice and helpful. To complete my bedroom set I will be going back and seeing Gus. Thanks for all your help Gus.<//Text>

<user>109417866112281021714</user><review>Excellent customer service. Gave this place another try after 5 years. Back then their selection of style seemed old school. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have since updated their furniture selections and find a lot to be desired! I also like that if you see something you like you can put a small deposit to hold the furniture until  you are ready to purchase. The sales staff  are friendly yet not pushy.  Will come again when looking for new pieces. Also their higher line of furniture is appropriately priced for quality pieces you can feel and see! Very happy with my purchase. Don't forget to get the protection plan, it covers your furniture against stains or damage for 5 years and they scotchguard for you if you ask before loading or delivering!</review><gmapID>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131<//gmapID></record>

Ordered a 5 piece bedroom set and mattress, 3 of the pieces came damaged. Was told they would get right on a replacement, most likely in a week or two. This was over a month ago and i was just told it would be a few more weeks to receive the replacement pieces, but they really couldn't give a date. When i asked about returning the items and taking by business elsewhere i was told it "wasn't logical to accept returns after 7 days." So now i have a bedroom set where more than half the pieces are damaged and no replacements in sight. Never doing business here again.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1556802261904, 'text': 'Hello Danielle- We apologize about the issues you experienced with your furniture and for the time it will take to replace.

The customer service here is fine. The products, however, are very economically made. If you are on a tight budget you can get some pretty good and trendy looking furniture. Don't expect to pass it on to the next generation though.

The store is massive and there is plenty of selection.< /text>

They do their best to undercut Ashley Furniture prices and did pretty well. They say that their prices are better because they buy in larger quantities but still do you homework. I was happy with their prices. Check out process was quick and organized. I worked with ROYA who was super quick, helpful, and always answered her phone when I called for questions and price matching or inventory. One down side was they couldn't order a dinning set that I found at Ashley. Return policy was 10 percent restocking fee if you want your money back or nothing if you exchange it for something else at the store. When you pick-up your furniture make them show you the hardware inside and check for scratches. My table was missing the 8 big bolts to fasten the table legs, too far to drive back and kind of a pain but I just went to Home Depot and got something that worked.< /review>< Pics>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Mathis Brothers Furniture is a complete scam, and they try to take every penny from you.  They promise every customer that they have the lowest price, but that is their strategy to steal your money.  I recently purchased a mattress from them, and less than a month later, a friend of mine also purchased the same exact mattress elsewhere for $725 cheaper.  That is a lot of money difference!  First, I asked whether a price match was possible, but in return I received laughter and discrimination from the sales, like I was an idiot!  With anger building up, I decided to return the mattress all together, but guess what?  Now, the sales are yelling and pointing their fingers at me saying if I can read or understand English.  This is not the place where you want to spend your hard-earned money.  They will gladly take your money then give you a big “F U” to your face!  I cannot believe the type of treatment and discrimination I received from Mathis Brothers Furnitures, all for a simple price match!  If you don’t want to be treated inhumanly, I suggest stay away from this business!<//text>< Pics>

<review>The delivery men were prompt and delivered my chair within the time frame that was given to me. I would recommend Mathis Brothers to friends and family. Their customer service is on point, from their sales rep to the men who deliver to your home. Thank you.<//review>< Gmap_id>

The delivery was timely. What I didn't like was the delivery guys were rushing to get out that it wasn't giving me time to think of where I wanted furniture. I understand, it was 6pm on Sunday!! Maybe Mathis should not do late Deliveries on Sunday!!

So I have to update my review, very unfortunate. I ended up returning one of the items and switching for another. I went to the store processed the return, picked the new item. I walked out with the idea that my delivery and the item that I would be returning were arranged as the sales men advised. I was told since I also was returning I would have to wait an additional day for the delivery. I then get a call the next day telling me that the store screwed up and only scheduled the new item. Because of there screw up I had to wait another week. I talked to several customer service reps who were not helpful. I talked to a sales manager who offered me s $50 credit. Really!!! That was ridiculous!!! It was interesting how even though they screwed up they did nothing to accommodate my delivery. As of today I have no clue as to when I'm going to get my furniture delivered.

This is very disappointing. I had a different idea about this store. At the end of the day they made money and don't care of having me wait. In addition this was my first shopping experience.
The  star that I leave is for the sales rep who tried to help me and was unsuccessful.< /text>

When my wife went to Mathis Bros to look for a coffee table, she was welcomed when she walked in.  There the salesperson walked her around describing the different tables.  Jair explained to her that when she made a decision,  she could call in and he could help her order the table without making the drive back to the store.  Everything went well and the table was delivered a few days later.  Easiest shopping experience she every had.<//review>

I had a wonderful experience shopping at Mathis Bros. the sales person, Steve H, was very helpful in showing me what was available. Very happy with my purchase of the leather Simon Chair and Ottoman. The only problem was that I did not receive the box of product I was supposed to receive when the furniture was picked up.</review>

<text>I was amazed by the sales floor. I have been to other local furniture  stores and the Mathis Brothers in Ontario is the best. We were warmly welcomed by Derrick. He was kind enough to help us out with our requests.  We mentioned we had a small budget and he understood what we were looking for.
First request was dining chairs. 2nd request where beds for a Cali king and a full.  He was not pushy at all but a great consultant. I have been to other places and they only saw us as a cash cow. Please thank Derrick Johnson again. We are receiving our product today will update as soon as we have furniture in place.</text><Name>Ramiro Rodriguez< /Name>< time>

I had a great experience with Mathis Brothers Furniture.  My wife and I picked out a new bedroom suite.  Jim Julien, our Sales Associate, was great.  He was very informative and had all the answers.The items we chose were out of stock.  He told it could be 3 - 4 weeks before they would be ready.  The items came in 6 days later.  I had the furniture delivered.  The delivery crew was awesome and fast.  Great furniture at very reasonable, competitive prices.<//text>

Our recent purchase of two Lazy Boy Recliners was an excellent

<text>I had a really good experience buying sofas from them.  The salesperson was friendly and they have good customer support.  The quality of the sofas is also good.  Let’s see how they are in a few years.  I have bought too many sofas that sag within the first few months.  My only issue with the sofas are the dimensions.  The sofas we bought were suppose to be 96 inches wide.  They are 102 inches wide!  So we had to return a sofa and exchange it for a chair.   The chair was suppose to be 69 inches wide but it was 66 inches wide.</text><pics>None</pics>< username>

I've been here a few times to shops for various furniture. I love this place. The customer service is awesome. The warranty is great. The delivery is awesome. There was only one time when i wasn't impressed with them, a saleswoman was following me and it really creeped me out. But that was fixed as soon as I found what i was looking for and a different sales representative helped me out.</text>

{'time': 1532355789073, 'text': "Hi Jeff- We apologize you are not happy with our delivery fees. Palm Springs is closer to our Indio, CA location and would have a cheaper delivery fee. Delivering your chair from Ontario, CA would be more costly because of the distance. Next time you visit us, please make sure to let your salesperson know you'd like to have your merchandise delivered out of the Indio location. Thank you for visiting us."}</response>

Great selection, and offerings range from low end and affordable to bespoke with hundreds of finishes.

Sales staff can hover around more than you might want, but are happy to answer questions when needed.

Delivery was next day and the crew was prompt and showed up at 4:00 sharp(scheduled between 4-9).<//Text>

<Review>Just wow! What a great experience. We have to admit that Mathis Brothers wasn't on our list to shop- the only reason we went was because my phone suggested it (so I guess some of its data-mining is used for good, lol)
Roya met us at the door, and at first we thought she'd be like the sales people we'd already dealt with, but she quickly distinguished herself by knowing exactly what we were looking for, telling us what we needed and then leaving us alone to talk it out and make up our minds. She even showed us the clearance room, since we only wanted a couch & chair, just in case we could find what we needed there. That's confidence!

We were leaning towards another set at another store, and Mathis was more expensive. Or so we thought. The price tags on Mathis' pieces was straightforward. The "other" place had high prices but with 50% off. But not the Mgrs. Specials, or 'select' pieces, etc.

So we told Roya we were going back to the other store to see if they could really do the 50% we were told, and Roya gave us her card, told us to call her if we decided to go with Mathis, and then we could do it all by phone, saving us a trip back.

As it turns out the "other" store (starts with a "A") shot themselves in the foot, first, by not actually being able to do the 50%- in fact we are still confused by the salesperson's math- but mostly by BADMOUTHING Mathis Brothers. Even after I showed the salesperson the couch & chair we liked, she told me my choice was unattractive.

So we called Roya on our way out of the parking lot, we had everything wrapped up by the time we got home and our beautiful reclining sofa & big comfy chair were delivered within 24 hours.  The delivery guys were clean, friendly & efficient.

Mathis Brothers and especially Roya- THANK YOU!</Review>< Pics>

Mathis Brothers should get it together. Even though the salesman and delivery men were very courteous, our experience of purchasing a bedroom set for our young son was just shy of terrible. I'll start with the fact that the first two set of bunk-beds we spotted had the wrong price tags; some would argue "false advertisement". We settled for a full size bed with the matching dresser and night stand. The bed displayed under-storage (drawers) and it was the main reason we decided on this bed as you can never go wrong with additional storage. The under storage did not display a separate price tag, nor were we advised that it was sold separately. Second, we were told that the bed was stocked in the Indio store and that it would take four days to arrive to Ontario. We agreed on the terms. We called at the fourth day to request an E.T.A on the delivery and we were told that it would take another week to be delivered. Not to mention the attitude you receive over the phone. We finally received the bed 12 days later with no under-storage.< /text>

My experience with Mathis Brothers Furniture was exceptional and this is why. On July 7th, I went to Sears and purchased an adjustable base and a mattress. I ask for them to deliver the furniture on July 21, 2018. The day they were supposed to deliver my furniture, I received a call informing me that I need to reschedule because they didn’t have the manpower to deliver the furniture. I was upset. I spoke with the manager Kelly from the delivery department and she careless about the inconvenience. So, I canceled the order. I then went to Mathis Brothers and purchased the adjustable base and the mattress the following day they delivered my furniture. This is what I call exceptional service.Thank you!</Text>

<review>When my wife went to Mathis Bros to look for a coffee table, she was welcomed when she walked in.  There the salesperson walked her around describing the different tables.  Jair explained to her that when she made a decision,  she could call in and he could help her order the table without making the drive back to the store.  Everything went well and the table was delivered a few days later.  Easiest shopping experience she every had.< /review>< rating>

Incredible experience...sales people didn't follow us around like puppy dogs and allowed us to look around without pressure.  When we were ready to buy and had a question on how something worked, they got power cords and plugged everything in for us to see.  Their delivery procedure was awesome!  they sent an email the day before telling us the approximate time of delivery, then they called an hour before delivery so we could be home.  This was a GREAT experience!!< /Review>

I was amazed by the sales floor. I have been to other local furniture  stores and the Mathis Brothers in Ontario is the best. We were warmly welcomed by Derrick. He was kind enough to help us out with our requests.  We mentioned we had a small budget and he understood what we were looking for.
First request was dining chairs. 2nd request where beds for a Cali king and a full.  He was not pushy at all but a great consultant. I have been to other places and they only saw us as a cash cow. Please thank Derrick Johnson again. We are receiving our product today will update as soon as we have furniture in place.</review>

We were helped almost as soon as we walked into the store.  We told her what we were looking for.  She directed us to the area where we needed to go.  There was no pressure and she she knew the answer to every question we had.  Everything went very quickly.  The very next day, the bed was delivered and set up.  We were very happy with the service from your store.  We will be back.< /Text>

In the last several months we have purchased several pieces of furniture.  All of the pieces we have received are such great quality, style, comfort and design.  The sales lady, Gloria Orellana, was outstanding.  We asked for her each time we went to the store and she guided us in the selection of furniture pieces and fabrics.  She made us feel so welcome.  We will go back to Mathis Brothers whenever we need furniture or accessories.<//Text>

We recently made a purchase at Mathis brothers in Ontario and our salesman Ramon Vardeh was awful, he walked way ahead of us when we asked to see furniture and it was difficult to keep up with him, he also seemed annoyed by us and told us our purchase will be delivered on Friday, however I found out he never scheduled the delivery and now I have to wait an additional week for delivery, I’m very dissatisfied with the service and will think of taking my business elsewhere next time.<//text>

I bought a second mattress from them after 3 years and they made a mistake on my mattress sizes (purchased KING size and delivered CAL-KING size), but later on they corrected it. Good place to shop, price is reasonable, people are nice. Make sure you take picture what you are buying and before you leave check the memo twice. Good luck.<//Text>

I love the store and merchandise but their finance department has issues.  After a hard sell from the associate that there wouldn't be a problem with financing I was only approved for half of the 1900.00 couch??.....but that was after the deposit, after the 6 weeks of waiting, after the several phone calls from the delivery department to schedule my delivery. So I went somewhere else and was approved for several thousand and will be furnishing my new home with them.< /Text>

Just purchased a leather sectional from Mathis Brothers Furniture Ontario, CA.  The experience reminds me of what my dad would call old fashioned customer service.  Our salesman Scott was extraordinary and when we were not satisfied with color variations and other small details of the delivered sectional, customer service immediately sent out another sectional that was satisfactory to us.  Thank-you Mathis Brothers and I highly recommend them if you are in the market for furniture.  Jim & Judi<//review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><review>We originally purchased a 10’ x 10’ Broyhill textured sectional.  After only about 2 months I noticed shredding on the cushions.  We do not have kids or pets.  We were advised that Mathis did not deal with Broyhill any longer so they were unable to replace the cushions.   I contacted Debra in Customer Service and she advised that, since we purchased the warranty, that we could use the credit to buy something else but no refund.  After about a week she stated that we only had 1 month to find something that totaled the amount we spent for the sectional and 1 week had already passed.  We thought this was unfair as there was nothing else in the showroom or website that we were attracted to.  It was not our fault that the product was not made well.  Now we had to just choose something so we would not lose almost $5,000.  We chose a sectional that was not exactly the size we wanted and the cost was less than the first one.  We had an $800 balance and Mathis refused to refund me the $800.  They advised that I have $800 on the books for the future.  Advised that I am retired and will be downsizing so I do not need any more furniture.  Mathis refuses to refund me the balance so needless to say I am very unhappy with the situation.  Don’t know if I would recommend Mathis to my friends and relatives.  We did not have a pleasant experience shopper at Mathis.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Mathis Brothers is one of my favorite stores - great prices and very helpful employees.  My latest purchase was a rug for our living room.  Guys in the carpet area were extremely helpful, and Dylan and his team delivered the rug promptly.  They even took our old rug upstairs for us.  Great company and do plan to make future purchases.< /text>

<pictures>None</pictures><review>A few weeks ago I made a visit to the Oklahoma City store.  Once in the store, I was promptly greeted by two sales persons.  I immediately informed them that I was there for Mr. McDaniel. They then paged him and I was on my way to what I thought an easy browsing experience.  Firstly, this store is way to big, with too many choices.  Well once greeted by Mr. McDaniel, I informed him that I was going to browse and the style of furniture I desired.  Mr. McDaniel was very helpful in touring me through the facility taking care to show me only what I asked.  I was free to sit, touch and match items.  Well needless to say I didn't make a purchase. My head was filled with too many designs and options.  The upside, Mr. McDaniel made my experience personal and well worth another trip for a full purchase.<//review></record>

They were very knowledgeable and helpful with all my questions. Miguel went the extra mile and rounded up four different chairs to go with the sofa and loveseat I had chosen. He was very patient with me while I made my decision, changed my mind twice, before finally finding exactly what I wanted. I would recommend them to anyone looking for good furniture at a great price</review>

<review>I had a pleasant experience at Mathis Brothers. My sales person Kay was very patient and helpful. I purchased two beautiful oversized reclining loveseats in a charcoal gray along with the protection plan for an additional $200. It's huge place with plenty varieties to choose from. Everyone was really nice welcoming. I will definitely refer my friends and family to MBs. My only regret is I had to drive an hour from Carson to Ontario, CA. I wish it was a closer location to my residence. The delivery charge was $210 because of the distance. It's a bit pricey.< /review><user>109657489579957620102<//user>< Pictures>

Great selection, surprisingly affordable prices, and helpful (not pushy staff) who helped us find items we were seeking.   We purchased a bedroom set, sofa, and end table. We first went to all the local stores but were disappointed not to find items we wished to purchase.  We took a drive from our home in Irvine to the Mathis Indio store.  Well worth the drive.  Excellent customer service as well.  We'll be back to buy more items.<//Text>

The customer service at the store is nice and friendly. But I had to wait an extra 3 weeks after the date I was told my furniture would arrive. and aside from that the sofas I got we're ripped and the cushions we're unevenly filled.   I made my purchase more than a month ago and until now I still have the ripped sofas at home and am currently waiting to get them replaced . I call the store and all I get are excuses and I get told I just have to wait. I made a purchase and paid in full since September and I'm extremely unsatisfied and frustrated. I would not go back a second time.</Text>

< Review>
Honestly I had a poor experience with them. The day I walked in on December 8, 2018 no one greeted me, nor did anyone come help me when asked. My aunt met me at the Ontario location and walked in and said the same thing of no one greeted her but helped people around her. Finally after walking around and Sitting on a few couches someone walked by and said hi are you finding everything ok, I said honestly you’re the first person to acknowledge us. He said I’m very sorry about that, I’ll help you. My aunt explained that we’re looking for a couch, one for me and one for her. He was very helpful at that point. We continued walking and looking until I found a couch that called my name. I was told that I can customize the fabric so I asked if someone can help me with that process. So he called the designer Jasmine who was very very helpful the entire way. The original associate was no where to be found but I had no idea that was our last encounter. We looked at fabric and put together the perfect couch for me. I was extremely happy, signed the papers, paid a down payment and even bought an amazing rug to go with it. I received a message on December 26, 2018 that my fabric has been discontinued and that I had to come in and choose another. Now my entire thought process and accents bought elsewhere were out the window because nothing matched it. I went back into the store on the 28th all the way from Los Angeles. And settled for a fabric I wasn’t happy with for the entire couch and pillows because the company discontinued all of the other options for the couch. My thought was why were they still up there if the customer choosing it would be disappointed as myself. So we walked around again and I found a pillow that I fell in love with, as I picked it up I was stabbed by an open pin hiding in the zipper. I gave it to a manager and we made a report just in case anything happened. I called the store to ask the policy of cancelling and was informed that because of the error of the couch I can cancel but it would need to be reviewed and approved by the GM. Jasmine messaged me to help me decide and I just felt by now it’s been a month and no couch, I really needed one so I settled (big mistake) my couch was finally delivered May 24, 2019. Now that I look back how insane is it to get a couch 6 months later and it’s not even what you truly want. The work looks rushed and it smells horrible like a sweaty quarterback m (ugggh) I’m annoyed with the buying process but Jasmine and the delivery men were great. So I give a star for each of them, but as far as purchasing for MB again, that’s a big NO for me and truly I don’t recommend. Oh and on May 1, 2019 I sent an email asking for someone to reach out about this terrible experience but no one called or referenced it at all. I spoke with Jasmine and she was able to get $60 off the couch for me but that only became the tip for the delivery men. So, thanks for the experience but no thanks you can’t fool me twice.<//Review>

I would not necessarily recommend the Ontario location.  I did not get satisfaction until I contacted the Corporate Office.  Maria helped me tremendously.  Ontario was helpful only in putting me in touch with Corporate.  Maria gets five stars from me.  I purchased a 7-piece patio set. Love it!</text>

The selection here was good but the service was not great. I came here with my girlfriend looking for a new sofa for the house. We waited around for a long time for someone to help us and once the sales rep did he did seem to interested answering all our questions. The sofa seemed well made but because the service was not good we decided to look elsewhere.</Text>

<Review>The selection is good but the manager Peter needs a class on customer service.   We were buying patio furniture and were being charged around $300 for delivery.  We asked for a delivery discount since we live in Riverside and are less than 20 miles from the store.  He was very rigid and basically told us to take it or leave it.  It would not come back for him.<//Review>< userid>

Went with my son to get a couch and a bed for my grandson,  the sales man (I think his name was Mario) was a great help, he listened to what we wanted n didn't try to push more expensive stuff on us when we told him what our budget was. Great experience and great selection. Thumbs up to you guys.</review>

I have been a customer of Mathis Bros for over five years.  My purchases include bedroom and living room furniture.  The sales associates have always been friendly and helpful as well as the employees in the pickup area.  My problem recently is with the furniture protection department.  I purchased the furniture protection for my couch and after four years needed a stain removal.  They sent someone out promptly.  However, they did not re-spray it with the stain protector and now after almost a year the stain is coming back to the surface.  I called the furniture protection and advised them of the issue and the customer service representative was very rude.  She stated she was the manager, did not have a boss, and pretty much I was out of luck.  If I pay for furniture protection, it should do just that as it states in the contract.  She stated they give a 30 day warranty on the stain removal.  What stain re-appears in only 30 days?  No customer, let alone a loyal customer, should be treated to this way.<//Review>

<review>We bought about $12K worth of brand name furniture from Mathis after doing our homework and realized that their prices are very competitive.

We check local in state, out of state, internet sellers and at the end, Mathis prices were competitive.  The other advantage of buying from Mathis is that they had all of the pieces in stock VS any other place we  went to, we had to wait for 6-8 weeks.

Our sales person was Roya was great and she was a joy to work with. (Not pushy).  We went to the store 3 times till we made the purchase.  We loved the fact that she was able to quickly put together a quote.  She would provide professional and expert advice being interior designer by looking at our house Pics, wall color, flooring other pieces and etc.  Thank you Roya for being patient with us !!!  We will be back since we need a few more pieces for kids bedroom.

We also decided to pick up our furniture and the guys at the warehouse were organized even during the busy time / weekend.

When we asked if we can inspect all pieces, they had no problem and opened all boxes and all looked good and then all boxes were taped up and safely loaded into our moving truck.

Overall great experience and we will buy again.

Thanks Roya and Mathis team,
Frank From OC< /review>< rating>

Web site needs lot of updating, unable to navigate without it jumping and skipping around. Color of furniture displayed is very poor, unable to see the actual color described. Just got frustrated trying to view this website. I will not be back.< /text>

The store representative at the Ontario store, Angelica was extremely helpful. However, you cannot request a delivery time so you are at the disposal of the delivery company. When the delivery people got to our place, they noticed that the bed frame was damaged, which makes me wonder if they check the furniture condition before loading it in their truck. The delivery guy kept suggesting to me how I can fix it and I should take the delivery anyways. I live alone so when I asked for help to move the futon which was already there, they refused to help me! I just thought that was a bit rude, the customer service told me that I shouldn't waste their time and if I upset that the delivery team cannot move my futon to accommodate my new bed then I should go ahead and cancel the order. She was extremely unhelpful!
As a customer who loves your inventory selection but is hesitant to shop there again- I highly suggest you add an option where the delivery company can help move old furniture. I am sure anyone who needs help will be willing to sign a waiver for it. Also, please train your phone staff to be more polite. There job is to answer customer calls - why would she refer to it as a "waste of time".< /Review>

Large inventory to choose from. My fiancée and I liked that we were not pressured in purchasing any furniture. The pricing in my opinion was fair. I liked how inviting the employees were. We ended up purchasing a sectional and had it delivered the following day. The whole process of walking in, to having the furniture placed in our home was an overall great experience. I can't thank the sales associate Rodney enough for making furniture purchasing stress less.< /text>

Updated Review : But I was not happy with one of their sales representive. One of them followed us continously and did not allow us to look around freely. That person was passing comments about us to other sales representives and we felt insulted.

Once piece of advice. Allow customers more freedom if you want them to buy them from your shop<//text><rate>2</rate><Gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131< /Gmap_id><pictures>None<//pictures><user_id>114537181222873789734< /user_id>< user_name>

We had a great experience at Mathis Brothers, Ontario CA. Our designer, Abby, asked all the right questions about the room we were furnishing.  She helped us pick out a sofa, two chairs and an entertainment console. The room looks beautiful! We would definitely shop Mathis Brothers again!</text>

From the time we walked in to the time of delivery we received great service. The sales person walked with us and answered all our questions  as we decided which bedroom set best fit our needs. Paying and setting date for delivery was quick and easy... Delivery was on time, and the guys were very professional, even asking if it would be ok to leave the front door open while bringing in the furniture.. all around great service and I'll definitely be returning to buy more!!!!< /text>

<text>Probably the largest warehouse furniture store in the U.S.  It's huge!  Plenty of parking and they pump music from the roof into the parking lot. Right inside on the left, there's a concierge desk.  On the right are the restrooms and a cafe.  A sales agent will welcome you as you walk in the door to qualify you for your needs.  They seem to be limited where they can go as my need was upstairs and the agent sent me on my way.  Anyhow, the sales people seem pretty knowledgeable to a point.  I got past that point and was referred to another agent that was.  Sales staff was easy to work with and the sales process pretty easy.  They print a slip for you to take to the cashier and they process payment/financing from there. I also had to utilize their customer service department.  They went above and beyond.  Just be careful of their warehouse people.  Don't let them tell you what they can/can't do.  They forced my furniture in my vehicle and damaged it.  So, I went back to customer service. They exchanged and delivered a new one for free.</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1465306824400, 'text': "Brian, thanks for providing such great feedback based on your last experience.

They are huge, work many options available. Sale items are a good deal, but prices can be on the high end... but you're paying for quality.

There's a discount room on the north east corner for slightly damaged floor samples.

Be cautious of sales staff who will follow you when it's not busy.< /Review>

<text>We were looking for a round area rug. Val and BG were extremely helpful. The store had a very good selection at various price points. FYI, within seconds of entering the store a sales person will be at your side, helpful in a massive store, but maybe a little too agressive.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Where do I begin?? Delivery fee was raised and now they offer this stupid membership for $69 which gives the customer some type of perks and lowers the delivery fee so instead of us paying almost $200 for delivery, it lowered it to about $130! They should just give their customers perks regardless instead of making us pay for perks with a stupid membership 😫 our salesman was too busy trying to make a sale that he didn't even offer us a bedframe nor ask if we had one and it's been years since buying a mattress that I had no idea of the beds even needed them still. So I called customer service about it and the girl was rude about the whole situation. I asked to talk to the sales manager Eugene and he was alot more understanding and offered us a free bed frame. Overall, it was a bad experience and we're not sure if we're ever gonna purchase from them anymore after all these changes were made 🙁</Text>

Very friendly people.  We had to return the chairs we bought because the color didn't work when we got them home.  No problem and full credit.  We picked out new chairs and brought them home the same day.  The warehouse staff was especially easy to deal with.<//review>

We were recommended to check them out from close friends.  Obviously their furniture quality is awesome, can't really beat it.  Their salespeople are cordial and overall professional.
Unfortunately, we had some major issues with shipping/delivery and overall scheduling that really soured our experience with them.  We had ordered a couch that we were told would take 8-12 weeks to deliver (due to customization); we also ordered a bedroom set. We were told a certain date for delivery for the bedroom set; when my wife called to check the date, it was later then initially told during the time of sale; we were also (without asking) told an earlier date of delivery for the couch than initially told. Long story short, we got our entire bedroom set later than told and had no idea when the couch was coming. This made out to be a frustrating and slightly stressful situation. As of this writing we have our entire set and the couch (arrived around the ten week mark; the issue was we were told different dates). Also, the couch is missing a hook to connect to another piece so now a technician needs to come out to install that (have not received a call for this). We did go in a discuss with one of the managers of the situation; we were told one of the shipping companies they're contracted with went bankrupt; so maybe this was an unfortunate time, but as a consumer who has paid, I did expect more.  The manager also never contacted us to update us as we were told.
Will we shop there again? Yes, probably, because we still need a few pieces; I am hoping this next time goes over smoother; otherwise, we'll have to look at smaller, private furniture companies.  I do want to add they sent a $250 certificate; not sure if this is standard or done for the inconvenience. Here's hoping for a better shipping experience.< /Text>

I must be getting old, but most of the furniture they had was very strange looking. I was looking for a cheap wooden headboard, but they hat ones that look like hotel bed headboards. Large, scrolling design, with tuck n roll material all over.</Review>

My order arrived on an earlier date than forecast.  The day before delivery I was contacted by a store representative who alerted me to my delivery and gave me an estimated time of delivery.  On the day of delivery I was contacted by the delivery truck driver who informed me that he was on his way.  My order was delivered in tact and complete.  I was very happy with my overall experience with Mathis Bros.</Review>

<review>visiting the store and our salesperson were great.  we are still having issues with the couch we purchased.  The first one didn't work correctly so they ordered us a new one.  They came today and another part of the couch is not working on this one.  Now we have to await a call to schedule delivery for a third time.  Don't they check to make sure all electronic parts are working correctly before sending out for deliver??</review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Updated Review : But I was not happy with one of their sales representive. One of them followed us continously and did not allow us to look around freely. That person was passing comments about us to other sales representives and we felt insulted.

Once piece of advice. Allow customers more freedom if you want them to buy them from your shop<//Text>< Pics>

Recommend Lawrence Jenkins to be your sales person. Personable and professional... Follows up with orders even from home... Appreciate the qualities he reflects. Orders were taken and payments can be made over the phone and that department is also personable.... So where was the

Called customer service and both girls were great about identifying me by my phone number. One of the tables had stain and damage issues. Let me know right up front that an exchange would be made as soon as a new shipment arrived... Even offered to deliver! Great prices and service is what Matthis Brothers is all about!<//Review>

Jorge was our sales guy and was friendly and courteous, he gave us our space all the while checking in every 15 min or so which I don't mind. I can't stand the sales people that follow you everywhere and are three steps behind every move you make.

When we had questions Jorge was there to answer and give his input.

When I was ready to order he took care of all the paper work promptly and wasn't pushy about the upgrades and such.

Great experience.< /Text>< Pictures>

I have purchased furniture and was advised to get furniture insurance. Beware I was charged twice and had to fight to get my refund. Now 2 years later I put in a claim and they state they cannot honor their agreement because it is not accidental. The insurance is fraud they do not tell you the insurance is through a third party. They do not stand behind what is written on paper or flyer. The sale personal tell you something different than customer service. Do not believe what they tell you ...lying is their business. Furniture falls apart within 2 years insurance or not.... Their customer service is non existent...Do not buy from this company.You will regret your decision. If you do Do Not get Extended Warranty. Check your reciept before you leave to ensure no mistakes or overcharges. Not an honest company.</review>

Our salesperson, Marta, went above and beyond good service.  While in the Ontario store, we needed another chair to replace the defective recliner that we had purchased (with fabric protection plan).  I had mentioned to Marta that I was wondering about warranty coverage since it was the chair padding that was the issue.  We immediately went to Customer Service, after explaining the situation was given store credit.  We used the store credit and had a new (different name brand) recliner delivered and the old one returned.  The folks at Mathis Bros definitely earned our 5 Star rating!< /text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>I NEVER do reviews but my experience has made me so upset that I believe they should receive one star. They told me I would receive my product in 3 days and in 2 weeks I had to call back on the status and was told it was back ordered until May 22nd. Then I called to confirm on Monday and was told that it wouldn't be in until June 2nd. That is when I was transferred to my original sales person where he told me that the bed set would not be in until July. By now I was extremely frustrated so he suggested that they could sell me the floor model at a 10% discount only to find out that the manufacturer would not approve it. So the next solution was shipping me a bed from the OKC store and it would take 3 weeks. So I said why wouldn't this have been an option 3 weeks ago when you knew the bed set was back ordered and the only response was that the manager had to make that decision. Fast forward to the next morning where my sales person called me to say that miraculously they had the bed in stock. Now this meant 2 things in my opinion... they were selling me the floor model without the discount or were giving me someone else's bed. Neither one was a great option. So I came to the decision to get my furniture from another store. I am really not an unreasonable person, a phone call to inform me of the back ordered would have changed this entire outcome but the lack of communication was dismal. I truly can't believe they would let this happen. Sooo if you are looking to buy here then save the time and DON'T.< /Text>< Date>

<Review>I have purchased furniture and was advised to get furniture insurance. Beware I was charged twice and had to fight to get my refund. Now 2 years later I put in a claim and they state they cannot honor their agreement because it is not accidental. The insurance is fraud they do not tell you the insurance is through a third party. They do not stand behind what is written on paper or flyer. The sale personal tell you something different than customer service. Do not believe what they tell you ...lying is their business. Furniture falls apart within 2 years insurance or not.... Their customer service is non existent...Do not buy from this company.You will regret your decision. If you do Do Not get Extended Warranty. Check your reciept before you leave to ensure no mistakes or overcharges. Not an honest company.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I feel home in the store. Everyone is nice and you truly feel welcome. I love that (most) sales person's know about how and what the items are made of, and from. I like spending my money when i know exactly what im buying. My problem is i keep going in your store and spending all my money. All good investments in my book. We have amazing, yet comfortable furnishings all over our home. And for this, we thank you.<//text>

Just bought a full bed set from these guys and I can tell you I am not disappointed. I ended up getting the Caldwell Pulinski. The quality of wood used and the construction of the furniture looks like it can last longer than a lifetime. This set was one of the more higher priced one but again you get what you pay for. And if you want quality these days there is a nice premium.</Text>

After looking at a couple other big name furniture stores I saw a bedroom set online that was available at Mathis Brothers. I was amazed at the selection and size of the store. Our salesperson Derrick was awesome and very informative, just the right kind of helpful, not stalking us like we experienced at Ashley. We learned a lot about leather couch quality. We really only intended on buying the bedroom set but walked out with a living and bedroom set. The delivery was also exceptional. I highly recommend Mathis Brothers.</review>

< review>
Our experience with Mathis Bros was amazing.  We have been looking for over a year for a large coffee table.  When we finally discovered Mathis Bros we were delighted for have several tables to choose from.  Ricky, our salesperson, was very helpful and stayed with us until we signed the paperwork and left the store.

The item we wanted was not on the floor so he took us to the warehouse next door.  The box was delivered within minutes, unpacked for our inspection and we decided the table was exactly what we were looking for.  He walked us to the cashier, who greeted us by name and had the paperwork ready for our payment and signature.    They apologized that it would be 2 days before they could deliver the table.  TWO DAYS!  We live in south Orange County and expected it would be 2 weeks!

We received an email  before we returned home that day reminding us of the delivery day and time.  On the delivery day we received an email reminder three hours before the delivery and then a phone call 30 minutes before they arrived.  The table base had already been assembled so the delivery took about 10 minutes.  The delivery men were courteous and efficient.

If all companies were run like Mathis Bros furniture shopping would be such a pleasure!  We will definitely be back for all our future purchases.

Than You!!

<review>Delivery’s are great when they put the right stuff on the truck.  Sometimes they deliver wrong stuff and sometimes the right stuff.  When it came to our Cal king Bedroom Set, they got it wrong 3 times!  Also we have a picture that should have came with the other stuff and it has been forgotten.< /review>< Pictures>

Every time I have gone there to make a purchase, I have been enthusiastically greeted as I entered, graciously directed to the department that I needed, and patiently assisted as I made my selection and payment. The price and quality of everything is excellent.
It was no deferent this time when I had to return an item because the color was wrong.

Mathis Brothers is the best furniture store ever. I have had my eye on a few accessories for my new home, decided Friday to buy, and had them in my home thanks to Mathis' in-stock & fast delivery service by the next day!! Love Mathis!!  Other stores it would have been a 6-8 week wait.< /Review>

In terms of variety choice and quality this place is fantastic. It's like a furniture Mall, it's so freaking huge.

Although it's all the way in Ontario, I made the trip from LA because I just needed more choices to pick from and they do have same day delivery and their warehouse is right next door so often most of the things are in stock. However be prepared to pay for a delivery fee if you're not nearby, I had to pay 90 bucks for my $1,300 couch and it was delivered at the time they estimated.

I left off one star because the sales people here are just on you like flys on shi* and they constantly follow you throughout the store until you finally tell them you're not interested or when you're finally interested. Our guy was nice but again I just don't like people looming around me well I'm trying to figure out what I want. And he was lucky that I was desperate enough I need of finding my furniture piece that I just went through with this purchase< /Review>

<date>1376584126345< /date><rating>3</rating><Review>Overall, the experience has been a positive one. I just called for service on a leather sofa and the customer service rep was at least cordial. She explained that the protection I purchased was for things like tears, stains and the like and that the problem I was having with springs (reclining sofa by "Lane"...but that is not a Mathis Bros. review issue), was covered by the manufacturers ltd lifetime warranty on the frame, springs and mechanism. The only reason I am giving 3 stars is due to the fact that my expectations were not "exceeded"...20 years in retail and a lifetime of customer service makes me a tough customer but one that is understanding to a point. There is PLENTY of room for the Mathis Brothers Service team to step it up!<//Review>< Pics>

We recently bought a CA. King size Vantage Plush mattress set by Serta, on 9/13 - delivered on 9/15/15. It was     Great trying "on" their many floor models, selection is massive so take your time choose wisely with the help of knowledgeable Sales persons. Overall we are happy with previous purchases and for sure future ones too!<//Text>

We walked into the store asking directions to the gift section. The gifts were easy to find. We spent $46. With that amount of money, we purchased five very fun gifts for three boys ages 6 thru 12 and one gift for a little girl. It was very close to Christmas so we were surprised to find such nice gifts for a very low price. It was a quick easy shopping excursion. Thank you, very much Mathis Brothers. We will go again next year earlier in the season.<//Review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I was walking the showroom both up stairs and down stairs for over 40 minutes and not one sales person came up to me to ask if I had any questions.  I did walk past several of sales people however not one even said hi.  I was dressed in work out pants and a hoodie, so maybe they thought was low class and pre judged me as not having money and that's why they didn't come up to me.  I wonder if I was dressed in my work cloths if they would have said hi or helped me out.  I would hate to think that Mathis Brothers staff pretty judges customers based on their clothing.  I have purchased  from MB before and my experience  was a lot different however I was dressed differantly.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<review>Price is great and good quality! 90% of my house funiture came from Mathis. Deliver guys weren’t nice at all this time and 2 times before. This time I bought a brand new sofa/love seat is missing a pillow. Deliver guys said that only 2 came with it, however there were 3 pillows in store on display(misleading customers). P.S. we were told by our salesman Rob it came with all 3 pillows. My fiancé called back, a lady at customer service was extremely rude and disrespectful. She was interrupting so many time during the conversation and said she was done and was going to hand up on us. Bottom line, looking for quality and price Mathis is a good place, be careful triple check your order, believe me you do NOT want to deal with their customer service!!!!!! A repeat customer spend nearly $8k should NOT be treated like this! Disappointment.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<Review>So much selection so had to go in more than once.  The sales associates will approach you immediately, but honestly, they dont badger you around the store. We had one of their complimentary design specialists help us pick out certain furniture.  We wanted sofas and tables that went with our wall colors and things like that.  She helped us with that and much more like picking out pillows and chairs.  Her name is Sana -- she's excellent.  Even the guys that helped load my stuff into my car were really helpful.  Overall -- good experience</Review><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

Have purchased items from Mathis brothers and what sets them apart is the ability to sit on almost every manufacturer, for example when I purchased my couch I had 15 couches that met my needs. As far as sales help our sales person Chris C was there with a tape measure and thorough descriptions of every couch.</Text>

<review>This is the best place to buy furniture and have great value. Thee are some people who should never come here if you are used to shopping at Wal Mart save your time this is not for you.
Your clothes will not fit anymore then the furniture will not fit your home.
If you want great service, great furniture and a salesperson to help you this is the place.<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>This is my favorite and only furniture store I shop at.  They have nothing but quality furniture.  The staff that helped me out was great especially Juan, he loaded up all our furniture and made sure it was secured.
They also have a huge clearance area where you can find great bargains for high quality furniture, that's my favorite area 😆
I definitely recommend this place!< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Very happy with the entire process. Sales team was very knowledgeable. Did not pressure us or make us feel like there were unnecessary add-ons. We selected custom fabric so the order was estimated 8-12 weeks. Ended us coming in 6 weeks. Delivery team was even working on Memorial Day. The delivery was super convenient, they even arrived 1 minute off anticipated start from the 1.5 hour window given. Couch looks great and we are very thankful for the warranty and follow up that Mathis Brothers has promised.<//Text><resp>None<//resp><Name>Alicia Thueme</Name>< Rate>

This was our first visit to Mathis Brothers in Ontario. Upon our arrival we were greeted by the Concierge's Desk and then introduced to our sales person Carol Lam. We told Carol we were looking for a new La-Z-Boy and she took us to the La-Z-Boy section of the store where we found our new rocker recliner. The recliner wasn't in stock at their store in the color we wanted but was found at another Mathis Brothers. Carol immediately arranged for our recliner to be transferred to their store within the next 10 days for pick up. She inquired about their "furniture protection plan" and we declined... we did not feel any pressure to get this service as other customers have complained about in their reviews. Much to our surprise I received an email four days after purchasing our La-Z-Boy that it was at the store and ready for pick up… WOW… speedy fast!!! All in all… Carol Lam was a pleasure to work with and will definitely recommend our friends and family to see her for all of their furniture needs at Mathis Brothers!!!<//Text>

Sales and delivery teams receive different furniture delivery guidelines, especially when a home has carpet. Delivery team uses different 3rd party vendors so some will refuse to wear shoe coverings when stepping onto carpet floors. Others will wear shoe coverings. So Mathis management isn't consist when sharing simple delivery policies. Customer Service Manager (Furniture Delivery) was very rude and disrespectful to me. At times, I was offended by her remarks by her hints of racial and cultural insensitivity. I recommend that any furniture delivery issues should be addressed to the sales team.</Review>< pics>

<Text>My wife went to Mathis brother to look for a bedroom set. She spoke to a sales rep Ampy , who in turn showed her around, and my wife found what she was looking for. I am giving them 5 stars across the board. For the service,  the store, the salesmen ship , and the delivery.  Every part was a great experience . So from myself and my wife , thank you very much.<//Text>< Pics>

<gmapID>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131< /gmapID><pics>None<//pics><Text>We went shopping for bedroom sets.  We were looking for Hooker brand furniture and after doing research on where to find retailers.  All the fingers pointed here.

At first you walk in and your overwhelmed by the grandeur size of this place!  Its HUGE!  They have an entire rug section.  Living room set-ups throughout the entire warehouse size establishment flooded the ground floor. Even an entire section of outdoor furniture sets too! Everything is well placed and organized.  Lots and lots of furniture.  Very nice stuff too.

But... unless you like to be accompanied by a used car salesman while you explore an all to be desired shopping experience.  After your greeted at the entrance, I suggest you move quickly to the front desk and immediately file a restraining order.  That mother f'er will cling to you like a 22 year old hopeless romantic female with no dad looking for love.  They are Hungry!!!  They will fight for you... They will knife each other in the back for you.  Hell, they will spit each other in the face for you!!  They will straight arm their co-workers and shove them right in front of you to say "hello" first.. They will give their first born to the Romans to sell you a friggen candle.
Commissions must be big $$ here.

We went to the 2nd floor, bed sets.  They had so many bed sets!  (The entire 2nd floor)  And, they had what we were looking for too!  The Hookers.  Mathis Bros stocks very nice high end furniture.

Our experience was this:  We found what we were looking for.  They had it!  On the floor!  And it was beautiful!  The salesman stated they make NO DEALS cuz they guarantee they have the LOWEST prices. Ok.  He checked the price of the bed and said it was discontinued.  But, he'll call the factory and see if they still have it available and call me back tomorrow since it was Sunday.  He did.  He quoted me the price.  Again, said they have the best deals.

So, being a consumer, I went to another furniture store to shop around. They didn't have it on show, but could order it.
She quoted the price $250 higher.

We went back to Mathis and said "we'll take it" to another predator who defeated the weaker animals of the jungle.  He comes back with the same higher price as the other store.  I sayz.. "No... the other cutthroat quoted it was $250 less.  So we argued until we found the original swindler.  Geez, the original guy said he never said that.  I'm getting that feeling of why I dumped my last girlfriend!  "Its the same price anyways, I could buy it from them."  "And you guys state your the lowest prices?"  "Are you crazy?"  "You quoted me less, that's why I'm back!"  "Now your telling me different?" Whatever man!  Whatever.  I'm here, lets get it.

Beware that back end drill.......  Delivery charges are extreme!!!!  considering the expensive furniture, and the markup already.
That wasn't explained earlier so it was a hit on me.  I was flushed on feeling them bend me over.  (My fault of course, I know I coulda walked)  Somebody made out HUGE on that one!!  Shhiieez...    Then they tried to finagle me about joining their "rewards."  It was an extra charge for joining a "rewards program!!"  Whatever dude.  Yes. They will push that.   They push on the savings for joining their "rewards program".  Get this, It cost $$ to join a rewards program. Ha.  Ya, rewards... for THEM.   2% off on pick up items and a few dollars off on the delivery charge.  They said its a great move to sign up!!  I will save!!
Well, I bust out the calculator right in front of  4 sharks pushing it on me and they all walk away.  Classy.  Get this, it cost more to sign up for rewards than it was for the discount they were too give.  But it still didn't stop some of them.   They pushed and pushed for the sale until I just finally lost it and said to F off!

In the end, I got the furniture I was looking for, had fun cussing in their store, my wife was sick and tired waiting for this mockery to end while holding and infant, walked out flushed thinking I probably paid too much.  But its hell of fine furniture.< /Text><Rate>3< /Rate>< response>

Great customer service! However, they did make a mistake to my order which caused the delay of my box spring, but they did make it up and gained a customer for life! Thank you Angelica and Maggie for the great customer service at the Ontario California location!</text>

Every time I go in to pay on my account I leave with another piece of furniture. I grew up on Barker Bros. furniture, this reminds me so much of that kind of well put together furniture. I love this store.</review>

<Date>1494526291694< /Date><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>BUYER BEWARE.  I bought a black leather sectional sofa and a regular size living room sofa and have been very pleased with them.  In 2012 I was due for a shoulder replacement operation and couldn't get to the store.  I was so pleased with the service that I ordered a recliner to match the sectional by phone.  It arrived and was the oversized recliner.  I didn't want that but had too much going on to change it.  Now the vinyl is peeling.  I called to see what to do.  Since I bought an extended coverage, it was still covered.  They asked for a picture and I emailed it.  Then they asked for the number of the coverage.  After more than a week I emailed them and asked when they were going to fix it.  They asked me when the peeling started.  I replied about 2 months ago.  It was a GOCHA QUESTION.  Any repair has to be reported within 5 days.  I paid for a fine print policy that I was unaware of.  Do you think that I will buy anything from them from now on?  Anita</Text>< pics>

My fiancé and I were ordered two new mattresses and frames for ourselves and daughter. Great experience in store and the delivery guys were awesome. They came in between the delivery time and called me when they were 30 mins from arriving. They set up both beds in under 30 minutes. They were very polite.< /Review>

<review>Price is great and good quality! 90% of my house funiture came from Mathis. Deliver guys weren’t nice at all this time and 2 times before. This time I bought a brand new sofa/love seat is missing a pillow. Deliver guys said that only 2 came with it, however there were 3 pillows in store on display(misleading customers). P.S. we were told by our salesman Rob it came with all 3 pillows. My fiancé called back, a lady at customer service was extremely rude and disrespectful. She was interrupting so many time during the conversation and said she was done and was going to hand up on us. Bottom line, looking for quality and price Mathis is a good place, be careful triple check your order, believe me you do NOT want to deal with their customer service!!!!!! A repeat customer spend nearly $8k should NOT be treated like this! Disappointment.< /review>< resp>

<review>Some of the worst service of my entire life. My mother and I walked in greeted by one person with seven other employees standing there and watching us. One of the floor employees named Sam was kind to us in the beginning and then when we decided on a side table, it seemed that a switch was turned and he was rude as he possibly could be. When we asked for a quote he walked off and came back handing the paper to us and walking away. Is this how any company should treat their customers? This establishment is beautiful, but the employees are disgusting. When we went to talk to a manager, Jorge, he just wrote off our complaint and tried to finish the sale. Never have I seen such awful service. I hope that they get a training in customer service soon for the sake of future customers, I really hope no one else gets treated this poorly ever again.<//review><Date>1548992753737<//Date><pictures>None<//pictures>< rate>

<text>it always irritates me that I shop anywhere else. I'd made a purchase elseware, shopped Mathis and found the same exact product cheaper and with a warranty that may actually be worth having vs the other store. Bought it and canceled the previous order.

The sad thing is I've done this same thing twice. From now on I'll start at Mathis.</text>< Pics>

Excellent selections of furniture ranging from  affordable to higher end. There are still sales people around but they don't attack you like some other stores.</Text>

We've ordered from Mathis Brothers many times. Excellent quality furniture that lasts. Sales reps are helpful. This time, we ordered a bed set. Delivery came on time and set everything up for us.</review>

<text>I’m am very disappointed at this place. It was my first purchase and I was going to come back next week to get more furniture for my house but with the experience I got I won’t be coming back. I came in yesterday and got a dining room table . I specifically told the sales guy that I need it delivered tomorrow because I am off of work . He said that would no problem since I am local. I called today to pay my remaining balance in the morning and they said that they closed the truck because the route is full. I talked to the sales rep that sold me the table and he said that he is not sure why because he put it on priority for delivery today .

All he can say is there any other day for delivery. I told him I’m off today as to why I needed the delivery today . All I’m saying is they don’t have the courtesy to understand that people do work and can’t take any days off that they want . I was told the delivery was today so I planned my day accordingly but now I have to accommodate to them to when they can deliver it to me. The sales rep probably said what he said to get the sale knowing he didn’t set anything up for me .

Lesson learned . Be careful and make sure you have everything in writing because the receipt has nothing noting the delivery dates.</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1536758404196, 'text': "Hi John- We apologize that your delivery was not set up for the date you were promised.

Update: I am pleased to report that the assistant manager came through and rectified the situation. He did a fantastic job and I am satisfied with the resolution.

The items themselves are fantastic. Competitively priced and good quality.
------
I purchased a mattress, box spring, and bed for $1069.29 today  from the Mathis Brothers location in Ontario, CA. It has been a complete fiasco and has resulted in my fiance and me sleeping on the floor tonight.

I arrived at the location around noon and picked a few items out to choose between. The associate on the floor, Albert, told me that if I wanted the items delivered tonight I would have to make a decision within thirty minutes. We made a hasty decision with Ray Santos, the sales associate responsible for my purchase, and proceeded to check out, at which time we were assured that the items would be delivered between 4 and 9 PM.

Two hours later I received a call informing me that my delivery would not be possible tonight. The associate I spoke with told me I could come to the store and pick the items up myself. I asked to speak to Ray, the sales associate, and he repeated the problem, and when I asked what could be done to solve the situation, he asked to call me back.

I waited two hours for Ray to call back and never heard from him. I called the store back at 5:55 and asked for Ray, who had gone home by this time. I was passed on to the assistant manager of sales, who informed me that he would be taking charge of the issue. I offered to come and pick up the items myself but I was told that at this point, the warehouse was closed and that it was impossible to take any items out of the store. As such, my fiance and I are now sleeping on the floor.

At this point I have a delivery tentatively scheduled for tomorrow from 4-9pm and am awaiting a phone call from the assistant manager with an update. He has been working very hard to resolve this issue and has been very helpful. I'm hoping he can find a way to remedy the situation and  I will update my review tomorrow with further information.<//text>

Good service, fair prices. Delivery is not convenient. After I purchased thousands of dollars of furniture they told me they were coming to my area for another delivery in a few weeks. I thought It was my only option at the time. I call to see if things had changed & they had more deliveries in my area. I was told they only come to my area twice a month. Just wished they would have told me that up front< /Review>

Found a great couch, staff were very helpful. However, couch is much darker than appeared in showroom. When I saw the salesman enter the order, I asked why the couch appeared darker on the screen and he stated the computer pics were much darker than the actual couch. Really the couch was much closer in color to the internet pic!<//text>

I have recently purchased several items from Mathis Brothers and LOVE each piece.  My sales person, Marsha C. was the BEST hands down and the deliveries each - all four of them were worry and hassle free and the guys were totally professional.  SO YOU MAY ASK - WHY ONLY 4 STARS?  Because twice I have had to call in ... and the customer service phone team are the WORST I have ever dealt with... one even hung up on me.  So if you can avoid ever having to call the store... the sales people and delivery folks are the best!<//Text>

<Text>This review is a reflection of their management. I was not going to write a review till I was contacted by their region manger and ensured that a local manger will contact me to take care of refunds. After a week later none has called me back.

We have worked with Linday,
Interior designer, before and have been very satisfied with her services. After spending considerable time she helped us
purchase 2 bedroom sets, living room, dining room set, 3 patio sets, and other items.  I was informed all the items  were in stock  but couple items had  to be shipped from the different branch which will take about a week. Once these Items arrived I was informed every item was in stock in the store. Their sales manager Scott, has confirmed every item that Lindsey has picked out for is ready to be picked up. I paid for it over the phone and arranged for delivery to my vacation home which is about 180 miles away. FYI Mathis brother does not "offer complementary delivery even you purchase 100k of furniture".
A love seat and a wine cart was not on the delivery. I was informed that their manager Scott made a mistake. This wouldn't have been a big issue if this was a local delivery. It cost me 2000 to have furniture delivered to my vacation home. My wife contacted them asked them to issue is a refund for the cart and place order for the love seat. They never offerd to help with delivery of the love seat and have not issued a refund for the wine cart. We were told that only manager can do that and he will call us to take care of it.  To date Scott  has not called us.
I responded to their internal survey and a regional manger contacted me who ensured that I will be issued a refund. He offered $100 off the order but refuse to have the love seat delivered. He did agree that it will not be possible to have this love seat delivered 180
Miles away for $100. I have not heard back from any one regarding the refund and no refund has been issued on my cc.
Their managers have offered horrible service to a loyal customer  who spent 40k on this order and has bought more than 50k of furniture from them before.< /Text>< Pictures>

We bought an expensive leather 2 sofas and a recliner and after 7 months the color of the leather shaded in many places. When we went to complain they said they will send someone to investigate in 72 hours. It passed a week and no one called us. Even when we tried to use the warranty that the sales manconvenced us to buy, they said it won’t help us and it’s useless.
Costner service employees are not straight forward either and tried to be sneaky with us.
I’m sorry to say worst quality and worst service ever.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1520946992791, 'text': 'Hi Youssi- We apologize about the issues you are having with your sofas and our lack of follow up.

<Text>Mediocre at best. Sales Staff and manager were very professional and respectful. Unfortunately, furniture delivery team wasn't the best. Sales and delivery teams receive different furniture delivery guidelines, especially when a home has carpet. Delivery team uses different 3rd party vendors so some will refuse to wear shoe coverings when stepping onto carpet floors. Others will wear shoe coverings. So Mathis management isn't consist when sharing simple delivery policies. Customer Service Manager (Furniture Delivery) was very rude and disrespectful to me. At times, I was offended by her remarks by her hints of racial and cultural insensitivity. I recommend that any furniture delivery issues should be addressed to the sales team.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>We special ordered living room furniture, when it came in one piece was damaged. They went ahead and ordered new piece. I was told that I can now only have it delivered in the morning because evening deliveries are for new customers. I told them I was a new customer it's just furniture was damaged upon arrival. So even though I received part of the things not damaged I'm know longer new customer. That is not right for as much as things cost.  It was delivered yesterday and was damaged again. Yes they helped and ordered new one and I can use damage one till new one comes in. Only problem is I have to be home during time frame for delivery. That is the only inconvenience is having to wait and schedule time to be home.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

it always irritates me that I shop anywhere else. I'd made a purchase elseware, shopped Mathis and found the same exact product cheaper and with a warranty that may actually be worth having vs the other store. Bought it and canceled the previous order.

The sad thing is I've done this same thing twice. From now on I'll start at Mathis.</text>

It matches our custome chair we bout from Chris months earlier. We have been helped by Chris several times in the past and his customer service far exceeded our expectations every time.

Bad customer service. Our chair comes in late and no one calls when it does come in. We talked to the manger and he doesn’t seem to care and tells us to call corporate. For a big company like this, I expected better customer service, especially when this was a very expensive chair. I will not be shopping here again. I hope it was worth losing a customer over it.< /Text>

We've been thrilled with the quality of furniture and impressed by the level of service we receive at Mathis Bros.
I would recommend them. Anthony helped us out on this last order, and went above and beyond to make sure we got our sideboard as soon as possible.<//Review>

I had searchd their website to determine if the had the tables I wanted to purchase.  Once I determine they had the product I went to the store.  I was routed to a sales representative who immediately completed the sale.  I was in and out of the store with my tables within 1/2 hour.  I've shopped at the store several times and love the selections they provide.<//review>

<text>We've bought a few different pieces of furniture from Mathis over the years and what brings us back each time is the selection's they have, the better prices and the customer service. This last time Tony Cortez helped us with the purchase of mattresses for our kids bunk beds and he came thru. Couldn't find the mattress we wanted in stock but got us a better mattress for the price of the mattress we wanted. It's instances like this that make my family keep coming back<//text><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>This review is a reflection of their management. I was not going to write a review till I was contacted by their region manger and ensured that a local manger will contact me to take care of refunds. After a week later none has called me back.

We have worked with Linday,
Interior designer, before and have been very satisfied with her services. After spending considerable time she helped us
purchase 2 bedroom sets, living room, dining room set, 3 patio sets, and other items.  I was informed all the items  were in stock  but couple items had  to be shipped from the different branch which will take about a week. Once these Items arrived I was informed every item was in stock in the store. Their sales manager Scott, has confirmed every item that Lindsey has picked out for is ready to be picked up. I paid for it over the phone and arranged for delivery to my vacation home which is about 180 miles away. FYI Mathis brother does not "offer complementary delivery even you purchase 100k of furniture".
A love seat and a wine cart was not on the delivery. I was informed that their manager Scott made a mistake. This wouldn't have been a big issue if this was a local delivery. It cost me 2000 to have furniture delivered to my vacation home. My wife contacted them asked them to issue is a refund for the cart and place order for the love seat. They never offerd to help with delivery of the love seat and have not issued a refund for the wine cart. We were told that only manager can do that and he will call us to take care of it.  To date Scott  has not called us.
I responded to their internal survey and a regional manger contacted me who ensured that I will be issued a refund. He offered $100 off the order but refuse to have the love seat delivered. He did agree that it will not be possible to have this love seat delivered 180
Miles away for $100. I have not heard back from any one regarding the refund and no refund has been issued on my cc.
Their managers have offered horrible service to a loyal customer  who spent 40k on this order and has bought more than 50k of furniture from them before.<//review>< pics>

<review>I have recently purchased several items from Mathis Brothers and LOVE each piece.  My sales person, Marsha C. was the BEST hands down and the deliveries each - all four of them were worry and hassle free and the guys were totally professional.  SO YOU MAY ASK - WHY ONLY 4 STARS?  Because twice I have had to call in ... and the customer service phone team are the WORST I have ever dealt with... one even hung up on me.  So if you can avoid ever having to call the store... the sales people and delivery folks are the best!< /review>< Response>

They sold me the warranty and now want to pass me off to a 3rd party that will not fix or replace my table even though the so called warranty has coverage for the damage. The ontario location does not even call me back just wants me to deal with it. They sold it and took the money so thst it that from them. Fighting now to get something or some kind of help but look out. I will never shop here again. So called extra warranty. As of 7/2018 I have shopped at other places for my home and better service with better pricing on same items. No help and no phone calls from this MB location.

I ordered few pieces of furniture yesterday. When we placed order, they told us everything'd be delivered today except for a dining table, which was out of stock. And asked us to stay at home today 4-8pm to wait for delivery. But this afternoon they called us said they couldn't deliver couch on time just because they didn't have enough room on the truck. We only have few days left here. So we planned every single evening hangout with family. This delay definitely mess all of our plans! We're not satisfied with this experience, which is not match what we've paid.< /text>

Extremely horrible customer service. We spent an hour looking for a bed until we were finally able to decide on one. We drove 1 1/2 hours home, rented a trailer, then drove 1 1/2 hours back to the store only to be told we couldn’t take the bed home with us because it was 8:10 pm and we had to be there by 8:00 pm. Our salesman NEVER said anything to us about a cut off time for pickup. He told us we needed to be back before closing time at 9:00 pm. It’s extremely petty and disgusting to treat customers this way. I will NEVER shop here again and I will be sure to tell all my family and friends to never shop there either. Horrible horrible experience!!!!!</review>

From what I have to deal with on my kitchen table that was over $1000. I will never shop with this company again. They sold me the warranty and now want to pass me off to a 3rd party that will not fix or replace my table even though the so called warranty has coverage for the damage. The ontario location does not even call me back just wants me to deal with it. They sold it and took the money so thst it that from them. Fighting now to get something or some kind of help but look out. I will never shop here again. So called extra warranty. As of 7/2018 I have shopped at other places for my home and better service with better pricing on same items. No help and no phone calls from this MB location. I will never spend at MB ever again after getting ripped on the so called warranty they push on items<//Text>

Great service. Very helpful sales people but not overly pushy. Amazing selection. Delivery service was excellent. I had to reschedule at the last minute, even though the furniture was already on the truck and almost at my house, they had no problem with it at all. I highly reccomend matthis brothers.<//Review>

<Text>This place has the worst customer service! We placed a special order for a dining set which was supposed to take 8-12 weeks. It arrived earlier than scheduled, but was missing a chair. Several calls and 5 months later, still no chair. Every time someone was supposed to get back to us they never did. During the last call we were told there was no record of the order so it was placed again. The experience with this place has been horrible. Even emails to the corporate site have gone unanswered. This is just bad business all around.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

The salesman was knowledgeable and helpful in every aspect of the transaction.

Delivery was quick and went without a hitch.

Awesome furniture store, I will be back.</text>

Update: I am pleased to report that the assistant manager came through and rectified the situation. He did a fantastic job and I am satisfied with the resolution.

The items themselves are fantastic. Competitively priced and good quality.
------
I purchased a mattress, box spring, and bed for $1069.29 today  from the Mathis Brothers location in Ontario, CA. It has been a complete fiasco and has resulted in my fiance and me sleeping on the floor tonight.

I arrived at the location around noon and picked a few items out to choose between. The associate on the floor, Albert, told me that if I wanted the items delivered tonight I would have to make a decision within thirty minutes. We made a hasty decision with Ray Santos, the sales associate responsible for my purchase, and proceeded to check out, at which time we were assured that the items would be delivered between 4 and 9 PM.

Two hours later I received a call informing me that my delivery would not be possible tonight. The associate I spoke with told me I could come to the store and pick the items up myself. I asked to speak to Ray, the sales associate, and he repeated the problem, and when I asked what could be done to solve the situation, he asked to call me back.

I waited two hours for Ray to call back and never heard from him. I called the store back at 5:55 and asked for Ray, who had gone home by this time. I was passed on to the assistant manager of sales, who informed me that he would be taking charge of the issue. I offered to come and pick up the items myself but I was told that at this point, the warehouse was closed and that it was impossible to take any items out of the store. As such, my fiance and I are now sleeping on the floor.

At this point I have a delivery tentatively scheduled for tomorrow from 4-9pm and am awaiting a phone call from the assistant manager with an update. He has been working very hard to resolve this issue and has been very helpful. I'm hoping he can find a way to remedy the situation and  I will update my review tomorrow with further information.<//Review>

<text>I am so disappointed trying to reach service department to know what are my options to switch my mattress, have not heard from a person that works there specifically I was told that Deborah does  not want to talk to me regarding this and to wait 30 days so I can talk about this. My sales rep Rosa Ortiz is not help at all once she got her commmision she forgot about me since I can’t talk to anyone else, as of now I have not received the furniture protection plan that i paid on 12/28 Deborah from Services said First this was supposed to be given to me at the time I paid for my furniture so she blamed it on sales Rep Rosa Ortiz and she said she sent it next day UPS today is January 8 and never received it, sorry I used to be a loyal customer but your store has changed so much on customer service and satisfaction I will NEVER EVER purchase furniture from you again, no wonder I saw so BAD comments reviews on yelp and others from customers that went to your store at Mathis Brothers at Ontario. Also I have to mention that Jennifer from Customer Service is rude, and with no customer skills whatsoever, poor attitude. My rating for you is not even 1 it is a ZERO!!!<//text>< pics>

I love Mathis Brothers, there customer service is superb, I had some leather chairs that were cracking after a year of tough use and with the furniture replacement plan, they replaced them. They are very business savy and want repeat customers. I also enjoy the furniture and wood conditioners, I use it on everything and they replace it for free.<//Text>

Went to buy a powered recliner we saw online and in stock at Ontario store and when the salesperson showed it to us it wasn't a powered recliner like the online site said. I think that's a very disappointing way to get people to your store!</Review>

Well, I didn't think I would ever have to do this, but here goes.
Let me start by saying that we have purchased multiple rooms of furniture from Mathis Bro.'s in the past, with no complaints.  This time however we're concerned.  We special ordered a lazy boy, power rocker recliner.
Splurging on the  price, since I have a heart condition that requires that I mostly sit to sleep.  (Haven't given in to the idea of a hospital bed yet)
So ,fast forward the many weeks of waiting are over, the chair is delivered.  The delivery guys were great!
It's the right size and upholstery, but not power anything.  So a discussion was had with  customer service,  the chair sent back,  and they would make contact with me ,by days end today....Radio silence. ..
So I  called there after 5pm, was told that an email was sent to someone, to try to figure out where it went wrong.. but no answer was received.  She did assure me however, that if it was their fault,  or lazy boys fault , they would "try to expidite" so that the 8 to 12 week wait could possibly be shorter .  Ok, so who else's fault could it be. I  do know that it is not OURS !  We paid in full for a very expensive special order chair . Which now I have to wait again for?
Look, I get that s**t happens . But here's where YOU fix it  or refund  the money and let us be on our way.  There are many other places that I am sure would appreciate our business.
Sad day.</text>

The sales rep was friendly and didn't watch over our shoulder. They didn't have what we were looking for even though they have a large selection of furniture. We were able to find what we wanted at many other places so it's not like we were looking for a single rate item.<//Review>

Definitely not the average furniture store. They have a large selection of bedroom furniture, dinning room sets, patio sets, matrasses. There is also a cafe to eat at if you get hungry or thirsty.<//Review>

Every aspect of the shopping experience went well. Only thing that bothered me was workers in the "cashier"  section seem to want to talk to each other then to help the customer. Warehouse men were excellent.<//review>

We have purchased from Mathis Brothers 3 times in the past 3 years and 2 of them have had major delivery and after sales issues. I would like to say that they do have nice products and the sales people have been professional. Unfortunately that’s where it ends. The after sales service and handling issues is terrible. They don’t seem to care what happens once they have your money. The 1st time we bought furniture and it took 3 times to get the delivery correct. The delivered the wrong furniture the first time, then they delivered all but 2 pieces that we order but also delivered someone else’s order and we finally had to go and pick up the other pieces on our own. 4 Week ago we bought a bedroom set and that was delivered correctly. Then about 3 weeks ago we purchased another bedroom set, TV stand and end tables. We knew that one of the tables was on backorder but would be in the next week. They told us that we would get a call the next week when the table arrived. It was 2 weeks and no once called to let us know if the table was in. I went in to find out when it would be delivered. They told me it was in and don’t know why no one called. They set up deliver for the next Monday. Monday came and went without delivery. Again I had to call the rep was very rude and told me that it was never schedule for delivery. I finally talked to get the delivery scheduled but it’s going to take another few days. Very poor service after the sale and no one seems to care!< /Text>

Mathis brothers always has a good selection of furniture and I have spent close to 5K shopping here. Everytime the experience has been seamless except for a recent experience. The salesperson that was helping out was very sweet. Since it was close to the holidays, we asked her if she can waive off the delivery charge and she said that she needed to talk to her manager. She was gone for a while and then came back with this guy who was supposedly her "manager". I was expecting the usual sales talk but he surprised me with his insulting attitude. He talked to me as if I am a moron - he said that if the delivery fee was waived, the truck driver would not get any money. I shot back saying that I am asking if they can waive off the charge for me and did not ask that the driver not be paid. He was so condescending that my wife and I left immediately, and honest to God we would have purchased the furniture that day if it were not for this guy.

It may be a longstanding policy that the delivery charge will not be waived, but there is a way to communicate the same to a customer. Such imbeciles should be fired from the premise and not allowed on the salesfloor, let alone walk around with the "manager" title. One less star for the bad "manager" experience.</text>

"Fast & furious"  Good value, fast delivery (2 days after purchase) & excellent response from delivery team.  Biggest  objection (why only 3 stars) is your limited sections for "love seat" Recliner's in black with the power feature.  Traveled over 70 miles to your large location in Ontario CA & found only ONE to choose from??  Store your size (5 football fields) should have had more choices.  Bought the one that did not have everything I wanted  (ie Storage location not convenient & when sitting  does not feel firm enough.)  BUT THATS ALL YOU HAD & after going that far I was not coming back empty handed but I must admit being all leather was a good value in comparison to others.!!</Text>

<text>Horrible Experience!!! Ordered furniture for the bedroom and when it was time for delivery a part of the bed set was missing. And one of my nightstands was damaged. After we bought everything and paid, the service went completely down. We called the store and customer service to see what's going on, no one was helpful. Our sales representative Charles, completely washed his hands of us, after he made the sale and got his commision. We got hold of the manager, Steve, unfortunately Steve lacks all management skills. He told me he was going to contact me later, but never did. I have now been waiting for 10 days and no response yet. Very bad customer service, once the sale is done. Charles is very careless about his customers. And the manager Steve is incompetent. If the manager acts this way, what would you expect from his sales workers?  Beware!<//text>< user_name>

Doug S. Was amazing and very patient with our 2 small children. We used to go to discount furniture stores in the past and ended up buying new furniture every two years after it broke, with Mathis brothers you get a great price and the product last for years!!!!

Some of the sales people hustle and try to help but some are asleep on the furniture.  Didn't really like their assortment of furniture not my style. Also very large pieces, if you live in a apartment or smaller space you wont find smaller pieces here.</Review>

Her name was Heather. I explained that there were specific requirements and my mind was set. She knew exactly what I was looking for, showed me a couple options (Broyhill, LazyBoy) and it was a done deal!! I even purchased a recliner, again, exactly what I was looking for. I was in and out in about an hour. BEST experience shopping!!<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

My sales rep Rosa Ortiz is not help at all once she got her commmision she forgot about me since I can’t talk to anyone else, as of now I have not received the furniture protection plan that i paid on 12/28 Deborah from Services said First this was supposed to be given to me at the time I paid for my furniture so she blamed it on sales Rep Rosa Ortiz and she said she sent it next day UPS today is January 8 and never received it, sorry I used to be a loyal customer but your store has changed so much on customer service and satisfaction I will NEVER EVER purchase furniture from you again, no wonder I saw so BAD comments reviews on yelp and others from customers that went to your store at Mathis Brothers at Ontario. Also I have to mention that Jennifer from Customer Service is rude, and with no customer skills whatsoever, poor attitude. My rating for you is not even 1 it is a ZERO!!!<//review></record>

<review>WOW! WORTH READING THIS REVIEW...Just tried to order a product online...get to the cart to finalize and it doesn't complete. So I do a chat and I'm told that they are having issues with their system. They ask what item. I tell them and they tell me they have to special order it and it will cost over $150.00 more!!! - what? ...last week when I first inquired about this item via a chat I was told they did have it in stock in my state, confirmed price, and they could have it delivered 24-48 hours and could order it from him ...But today when we are ready to purchase I'm told via a chat with a sales rep that they only carry this item in Oklahoma (no where on the website/cart does it indicate that?) and that is why it would 1. cost more for special order ($150) 2. I could pay $60 to have it transferred from Oklahoma. So I call my local store and get an online sales manager. The online manger kept pretending her cell phone was cutting out when I said, how can you legally do this? What store uses cell phones is one mystery question in itself! I told her that this store should be reported for pricing fraud and it was just silence from her end  - but when I said something about cost if I wanted to buy she could hear me just fine. She said, the terms of agreement says that prices can change - well ya does that mean they can do that after your placed on order - well yes, she said they would have reviewed the order and had to add additional charges - so guess what from my experience their online order pricing is bogus! I read the bad review on this store and thought it was just difficult customers perhaps... all I know is I did my homework on the item - confirmed in a prior chat - placed the order within a week - get to the check out it looks spot on - then the purchase won't go through - You know - I'm really doubting the issue with their online order system today as being a  tech problem is even true - I'm thinking they do not disclose the truth about pricing and when you place the order the system won't let it go through you contact them via chat/phone to see if you are going to be charged (did the order place)... and then the sales rep gives you their number to call them - I'm thinking they are trying to get you really interested in the item and then pull this up pricing on customers. I'm going to contact BBB and Weights and Means about this! Too many other places to purchase furniture - don't waist your time like I have this week!</review>< pictures>

We were/are very pleased with the total experience from the sales person to the delivery persons and everyone in between.

The furniture was delivered when promised. The delivery driver kept us posted as to when to expect them and were vey cartious and professional.
They assembled the the items and test them before leaving and asked about their performance and if we had any questions.<//Text>

Love the store and the furniture, but DO NOT BUY THEIR FURNITURE PROTECTION PROGRAM!!!  THEY ARE IMPOSSIBLE TO DEAL WITH, THEY NEVER ANSWER THEIR PHONE, OR EMAIL, 6 MONTHS LATER, IF YOU DO GET SOMONE, THEY SUB THE REPAIR OUT TO A FLY BY NIGHT CONTRACTOR AND COME OUT AND DO AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE, THEN DRUM UP SOME REASON TO DENY YOUR CLAIM!!!!  THEY SUCK!!!!!!!  TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!  When you go in to the store and complain, "they can't help you" - as the furniture protection folks are independently located in Oklahoma and not part of the store.  You have to deal wit them directly.  I wish they had zero or negative stars as a rating!!!<//Review>

*** READ THE FINAL OUTCOME OF OUR SITUATION BELOW ***
REVISION – DON’T BUY HERE TILL YOU’VE READ THIS!

I wrote a positive 5 star review a few weeks ago about this establishment however our situation has changed drastically. We purchased 2 La-Z-Boy recliners (over $1000) and we picked them up and brought them home. We discovered that the return mechanisms make a horrendous noise when closing the foot support and it doesn't extend high enough to be in a relaxed position (plus a few other problems). We're told that because they ordered them from La-Z-Boy it's considered a "Special Order" and that we're stuck with them poor quality and all. They state it's our fault for not noticing the problems at the showroom and they REFUSE to exchange them. We did not alter anything about the chairs to be considered  a special order they simply don't store them in their warehouse. But this is the way the safeguard themselves from having to deal with their suppliers. So SCREW the customers and make their fortune on 1 time deals. I'm sure we're not the ONLY ONES whom been had by these shysters. We have been long time loyal customers long before "Rit" became their spokesman and I certainly don't intend to be robbed out of my hard earned money and be silent about it. La-Z-Boy is not a cheap brand and why 2 big giants in the industry can't find a way to make things right for their customers is beyond me. The so called customer service rep only repeats what's on her script about them being special order items and never offered to speak with her superior. They sent a contractor out who admitted that this is a major complaint about the brand but it's considered a "Safety issue”. Good grief, aren’t there any quality control protocols at any of these establishments or concern enough about their brand??? I will be communicating with La-Z-Boy directly and I will keep everyone posted. Let me know if you've been had by this so called policy at Mathis Bros. I'm curious on how many of us are out there. I did ask to speak with Rit about this situation because I find it hard to believe he would be in agreement with this attitude/policy. I didn't have any intentions of going public with this but the customer rep told me boldly "that will not happen; he doesn't get involved with such matters".   Of course I'll be sharing this on all the other social platforms. We don't want anyone else to get burned at Mathis Brothers.

FINAL REVISION 11/14/18
It's been a few months since my last review of this establishment so here goes. Mathis Bros. did make a final offer after many attempts to settle this dispute. They generously offered to "replace" the defective chairs but only after us agreeing to paying a 30% "restocking charge which was absurd on their part. Their "Customer Retention Mgr" got quite huffy and gave us her ultimate offer. They would accept the defective chairs with no restocking fees but we had to agree on NEVER RETURNING to their store again, true story.  We happily accepted the offer and took the bloody chairs back and received our check in the mail a couple of weeks later. Of course we found other recliners that were less expensive and perform beautifully.  Check it out if you dare to compare; Furniture Planet in Cerritos.< /Review>

Loved the store and the collections. Found great deals in the clearance center. The only thing I don't like about this store is their sales model. One of the sales person told us they are commission only staff. So the minute you walk in the store, Salespeople will greet you and try to help you hoping to make a deal. But it becomes annoying when they follow you everywhere you go. I did ask some questions while we were browsing and told the salesperson that we are just looking and she doesn't need to follow us. She gave us her business card and asked us to call her if we have questions. At the end of our tour, we went to the clearance center and found something we are interested in but not sure if it worked. A sales person standing next to me offered help and brought in power cord to test everything for us.  It turned out everything's working. We decided to buy it. While he was entering our information, the other sales person came over and questioned us why we didn't call her and got upset.  Come on, why am I obligated to call you and wait for you to come over from a remote corner(you will know what I'm talking about if you've been there. The place is almost double the size of a COSTCO warehouse) to give me a simple answer. Based on the answer, I might not make any purchase. And then what? When we were walking out, we saw her again, she gave us a dirty look. How unprofessional.</Text>

I love Mathis Brothers, there customer service is superb, I had some leather chairs that were cracking after a year of tough use and with the furniture replacement plan, they replaced them. They are very business savy and want repeat customers. I also enjoy the furniture and wood conditioners, I use it on everything and they replace it for free.< /review>

WOW! WORTH READING THIS REVIEW...Just tried to order a product online...get to the cart to finalize and it doesn't complete. So I do a chat and I'm told that they are having issues with their system. They ask what item. I tell them and they tell me they have to special order it and it will cost over $150.00 more!!! - what? ...last week when I first inquired about this item via a chat I was told they did have it in stock in my state, confirmed price, and they could have it delivered 24-48 hours and could order it from him ...But today when we are ready to purchase I'm told via a chat with a sales rep that they only carry this item in Oklahoma (no where on the website/cart does it indicate that?) and that is why it would 1. cost more for special order ($150) 2. I could pay $60 to have it transferred from Oklahoma. So I call my local store and get an online sales manager. The online manger kept pretending her cell phone was cutting out when I said, how can you legally do this? What store uses cell phones is one mystery question in itself! I told her that this store should be reported for pricing fraud and it was just silence from her end  - but when I said something about cost if I wanted to buy she could hear me just fine. She said, the terms of agreement says that prices can change - well ya does that mean they can do that after your placed on order - well yes, she said they would have reviewed the order and had to add additional charges - so guess what from my experience their online order pricing is bogus! I read the bad review on this store and thought it was just difficult customers perhaps... all I know is I did my homework on the item - confirmed in a prior chat - placed the order within a week - get to the check out it looks spot on - then the purchase won't go through - You know - I'm really doubting the issue with their online order system today as being a  tech problem is even true - I'm thinking they do not disclose the truth about pricing and when you place the order the system won't let it go through you contact them via chat/phone to see if you are going to be charged (did the order place)... and then the sales rep gives you their number to call them - I'm thinking they are trying to get you really interested in the item and then pull this up pricing on customers. I'm going to contact BBB and Weights and Means about this! Too many other places to purchase furniture - don't waist your time like I have this week!</text>

Poor customer service. Recieved email call my 2 items were ready for pick up 2 1/2 weeks ago. Clerk or sales manager lied about order when I came to pick it up. Clerk stated only one of 2 items was reserved in my name and the 2nd was no longer there. Manager said one of the two was damaged.  Either way nothing was communicated with customer until I arrived to pick them up. Will never go there again and will not recommend them to anyone I know.< /Review>

Nothing but good. We were treated first class by all the Mathis employees. Specially by our salesman Ank Lam. We bought a chair but after using it a few days, it was hurting my back. I called customer relations and talked to a gentleman named Eric He set it up for us to return and exchange the chair. When we returned, Ank helped us select another chair. We now have this new chair and are very happy with it. I hope that Rit Mathis sees this review. You have a fabulous company.

A very happy!!! Maurice & Mildred H Wilson< /text>

We had a excellent experience at Mathis Brothers. We usually shop at Ashley Furniture for all our needs but decided to give Mathis Brothers a try. Paula our sales rep was awesome she was very friendly and listened to our needs thru the whole process. We had our six children with us and shopping for furniture can be challenging with them. Paula helped us from the minute we walked in to the minute we walked out. We will be using Mathis Brothers for our future furniture needs. Thanks<//review>

Erick has a big heart and is a good person inside and out.  I highly recommend Erick Serda for any of your future visit's to Mathis Brothers.</Text><Response>None< /Response>< name>

UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE OVER CHARGE FOR DELIVERY AND LIE ABOUT THE MATERIALS IS THEIR LEATHERS SOFA. We walk in to the store asking for their leather sections and right away Ramon Vardeh point to us to one of  their  most expensive leathers sofa. There was one I liked and I ask Ramon if this was feather fill and told me it was that's why it was so soft because it was feather fill. By this time it was around 7:45 pm  and I trusted Ramon he was telling the true. We paid top dollar as it was one of their best. That same night my wife checks online to see if this was feather fill and is Not. Next morning call to cancel order. If their sales people lie to sale what is Mathis doing about to correct this issue.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>This is my first time and the last experience with Mathis Brothers Furniture! I bought and picked up a cal king bed last week but when I unwrapped, there are 2 huge scrapes, one is on the corner leg of the head board and another one on the corner of the top foot board! So, Me and my wife decided that it's Ok for those corners scrape because we don't wanna repack and return it, those are heavy! At the end after we installed the frame, there are no flat legs (8 legs) at all and sort the screws. I made a phone call to tell them what part are missing but the guy who answered the phone, sound like I made it up, but he still has to send me those legs through the UPS and there was no customer service. I gave  2 stars just only for their store environment that's it. Note everyone, before you buy anything, please let them unwrap it and show you how it is before you take it home.</Review>< UserId.>

<text>Poor customer service. Recieved email call my 2 items were ready for pick up 2 1/2 weeks ago. Clerk or sales manager lied about order when I came to pick it up. Clerk stated only one of 2 items was reserved in my name and the 2nd was no longer there. Manager said one of the two was damaged.  Either way nothing was communicated with customer until I arrived to pick them up. Will never go there again and will not recommend them to anyone I know.< /text><rating>1< /rating>< GmapID>

I purchased s sofa, waited 3 months for delivery and when I went to sit down , you sunk, the seats were from. Brand new sofa and you were sinking down when you sat on it. Called customer service,  sent pics,  Cynthia Garcia in customer servive, said, the only thing t do is restuff.
I did , waiting a week, when I received them Saturday,  they didn't even fit the sofa  because they were so overly stuffed ! I was hosted  mother's day, and i had no sofa to poeple sit on!!!!!!
Called Cynthia Garcia , and she could not provide customer service to a VERY unhappy, pisst off cusomer.
They will not take back sofa or give me my money back . SHAME  ON MATHIS BROTHERS!  PLEASE, PLEASE ,DO  NOT BUY AT MSTHIS BROTHER'S. They will ripp you off and won't make it right. By fhe way, they currently do not have a store manager. They can't get anyone to call mme back beacuuse "They are in a meeting" DO NOT BUY FROM MATHIS BROTHER'S !< /Text>

I saw Rit Mathis' advertisement on TV about the best selection of outdoor furniture so I went to the web site.  I ordered and there was an issue,  the table I chose wasn't available, so I ended up driving from the South Bay to Ontario to go to the store and make another choice.  All the while being helped by two lovely men who guided me thru the process.  I made my choice at the store and delivery day came around.  The driver couldn't have been nicer.  It was definitely a 5 star job. The problem, the hardware sent with my table was not correct so they could not assemble it. Upon further inspection there was some damage to the table.  I called the sales people and they suggested a nice discount if I kept the table and they will come out with the appropriate hardware and assemble my table.  I was totally satisfied and only wish that Mathis Brothers was not so far away. I will shop there again and with my two salesmen, Kevin and Sam.  Thank you!<//Text>< Response>

< Review>
On May 11 we  bought a entertainment center 2 lounge chairs and 2 end tables.  We were told at that time the entertainment center would take a week or 2 for delivery.  The chairs and end tables were delivered and set up within a couple of days.  May soon became June then July.  I called Mathis bros mid month and told that gee whiz the entertainment center was in stock and golly we forgot to call you. Needless to say this isn't an earth shattering it just pisses me off at the cavalier attitude expressed that so what we got you anyway.  Will I shop a Mathis Bros again probably will I look for someone else probably.

< Review>
I purchased s sofa, waited 3 months for delivery and when I went to sit down , you sunk, the seats were from. Brand new sofa and you were sinking down when you sat on it. Called customer service,  sent pics,  Cynthia Garcia in customer servive, said, the only thing t do is restuff.
I did , waiting a week, when I received them Saturday,  they didn't even fit the sofa  because they were so overly stuffed ! I was hosted  mother's day, and i had no sofa to poeple sit on!!!!!!
Called Cynthia Garcia , and she could not provide customer service to a VERY unhappy, pisst off cusomer.
They will not take back sofa or give me my money back . SHAME  ON MATHIS BROTHERS!  PLEASE, PLEASE ,DO  NOT BUY AT MSTHIS BROTHER'S. They will ripp you off and won't make it right. By fhe way, they currently do not have a store manager. They can't get anyone to call mme back beacuuse "They are in a meeting" DO NOT BUY FROM MATHIS BROTHER'S !< /Review>

<text>So far so good. I am waiting on my Porter XL Media center with Fireplace furntiure delivery for 12/31 that I purchased on 12/29. They would have delivered on 12/30 but I need to get all my crap out of the way first! They matched an internet price without any haggling and were $186 cheaper for the SAME EXACT thing as Ashley who were not very helpful and would not price match anything on the internet. I could have gone back to Ashley with the "brick & Mortar" price match but the salesman was very helpful and I even bought 2 end tables for a great price.</text>< pics>

<Review>Their customer service for their warranty Dept is terrible. Rude, do not care. Even threatens the customer. Ouch! Make sure you ask what the warranty actually covers!

<Text>I actually like the store~ I love the merchandise that I've purchased.  The only thing is they don't leave you alone!  I cam into the store and they immediately approached me and I explained to them that there was a gentleman that I was working with a couple of days prior to that visit and that I would make sure he got the sale.  I also told them that i wanted to spend some time alone before I spoke with him to finalize the purchase.

I looke up once I got to the bedroom sets and he was strolling around but looking at me.  It was really creepy and I was angered that I didn't have the time to look around like I asked.  He then came over and I explained to him that I would let him know when I was ready and he still continued to pop up.  All of them are that way and it will stop me from shopping there and I'll take my business to Living Spaces.<//Text><Rating>1</Rating></record>

<text>Their website is useless...full of errors.  The TV commercial with one of the brothers says great things about the store....I'm not sure that is the case, as you can not view anything online first.   When you call the store.....the sales people are rude and unhelpful.  Not sure this is worth any ones time.....there are plenty of other stores that would love to have your business...you have to check out the large furniture shopping area in Costa Mesa...tons of stores...lots to choose from...not worth the drive all the way to Ontario to find NOTHING....how sad....all garbage.< /text>< user_id>

< review>
On May 11 we  bought a entertainment center 2 lounge chairs and 2 end tables.  We were told at that time the entertainment center would take a week or 2 for delivery.  The chairs and end tables were delivered and set up within a couple of days.  May soon became June then July.  I called Mathis bros mid month and told that gee whiz the entertainment center was in stock and golly we forgot to call you. Needless to say this isn't an earth shattering it just pisses me off at the cavalier attitude expressed that so what we got you anyway.  Will I shop a Mathis Bros again probably will I look for someone else probably.

< review>
I have mixed feelings about writing this review.  We purchased 3 dresses, 2 night stands, a mattress set, a recliner and a whole office desk set within a month on 5 different trips.  On one hand, lucky, got a great sales person, Laura from the very beginning.  Friendly and patient.  She helped put ideas together, worked on special orders, calls me to reconfirm the deliveries, endlessly try to contact customer service dept on my behalf...etc, a true professional.  On the other hand, the customer service is so bad I'm not sure if we want to purchase anything else from them ever again.

We purchased a chest, after unpacked, noticed that the whole thing was tile to the side, we tried to adjusted the leg pieces, but still the drawers was uneven due to the base unit is lopsided, so we called our sales person.  She apologized, and said she will contact customer service.  A week goes by, nothing from CS.  So I called our sales person again, she contacted CS again, and they finally called.  They told us to bring in the piece to switch it out.  I told them we do not want to move the piece since it's defect already.  I told them since I have another delivery coming, the delivery guys can just take it back and deliver the new unit at the same time.  Well, that was not done on the second delivery since it was not on the paper with the orders, the delivery guys would not take the unit.  Guess who I called again?  Laura contacted CS again, and told me that they now want to send a tech guy out to look at the unit first to determinate if it's fixable.  Another week goes by, no tech calls.  Here we go again...Laura had to send in another request and someone finally called to make an appt for the tech to come out.  We agreed on a visit between 9-10am this morning.  The tech called around 9:55am and said he will be late for 20 mins.  I had a conference call scheduled at 10:30am, so I told him it was okay.  10:30am, still no show, had to rescheduled my conference call since I had no idea when he was going to show up.  Finally at my door at 11:00am.  Take a look at the chest, turn the little screw at the bottom of the leg and tells me it's fixed.  I'm not sure if he think I was the housewives of IE or if I looked stupid or what?  NO! The chest is not fixed since it's still lopsided, so I insisted on switching out for another one.  We now had this piece of chest for almost a month...Then he asked me why I was so angry, duh!!!  You were so late to start with, wasted my valuable time, and treat me liked a 6 year old!  If my employee did that to my clients, I would have fired them.  Now the tech tells me he has to take pictures of the unit, and someone will contact me within 48 hours to let me know what the decision is.  Really???  I called the sales manager Scott as soon as he left, and thank you Scott, he had it taken care of within 2 hours.  Will redeliver another unit and pick up the defect one in 3 days.  Now, that wasn't so hard, was it?  Why they made me wait for a whole month and the run around is beyond me, especially after we spent more then 7K at the store?

With our mattress delivery, we also purchased pillows and bed protector.  The delivery guys left out the protector, so again, called Laura.  At least this one was an easy fix, they FedEx it within 3 days.
So the bottom lines is, nothing is prefect.  Which is fine and understandable when some furniture turns out to have defects, or sometimes human error happens.  But I'm not sure what I would of done without my salesperson dealing with the CS dept on my behalf tirelessly.

Kudos to Laura for being a true sport, and to Mr. Mathis, you should really look into your CS dept and the cashier dept.  Twice I was there late, trying to pay the order before the store closes.  Only one cashier at the counter both times, with 3-4 different people behind the counter doing not sure what?  And a line of customers for that last minute purchase.  Hey, it's retail, all hands should be on deck right before closing, why not finish it with great customer service especially for the paying clients???<//review>

I am so upset with this company and the way they chose to handle a discrepancy! I purchased a mattress there 12/26/2016 and returned it 12/29/2016 , repurchased a new one January 2nd 2017 and had the deferred 12mos. same as cash .  Well my concern was with the same as cash issue.  Is it being charged in December or January ? I was told January , I said ok good.  Well I looked at my statement and got charged $1,000 same as cash took effect 12/17?  Called spoke with the cashier Prisca , who was rude and told her the error and she said there is no error. Well there is but since they did not do the charge correctly I need to accept the deferred charged based on a 4,796 amount made in Dec. 2016 vs the new amount which was 3,696 made in January . So I asked how can that be? She said we did not void it out?  Ok? So because your company did it INCORRECTLY now I need to pay more? her reply yes!  What the heck!  I asked to speak with the manager , she said " My manager agreed"  What? Who is your manager?  "Her name is Sylvia , she is my assistant manager"  Ok, can I speak with her? Yes, wait , was left on hold for 20 mins. called back 2x 2nd time got transferred and per Prisca
who came to the phone giggling? Um my manager is on another call. What?  So you could not come back on the phone and be courteous and let me know sooner?  She giggled and said um no, I am letting you know now.   NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO AND PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THEM AGAIN!!  THEIR STAFF IS SO UNPROFESSIONAL!  NO RESPECT!  I will be fighting this matter. Will post outcome...  I do not feel it is right to be charged a deferred amount on a purchase you did not buy...</text>

If you're ready to be overwhelmed by ostentatious oversized furniture, this is the place for you. I don't mean that as an insult, I just mean it is a very easy place to get lost in and very much caters to a certain aesthetic, so if what you've seen in ads doesn't appeal, don't waste your time going here</Text>

On 2/17/2017, I went there and wanted to get a sofa set that can be deliver right away (i.e. in stock). I ended up liking a sofa and love seat plus some other thing. The sofa was in stock and ready for deliver next day. However, the love seat was out of stock.
So I asked the sales person how long it will take because if it's too long then I'll go for another set. The sales person went and check then came back saying I will get it before March. I was still a little worry because the last time another furniture store did not delivery. The sales person repeatedly promised me that it will get to me before March, as I keep asking if she was sure about it. So I went and pay the whole set in full. The first piece got delivered the next day, but the second one is still not here...
I contact the sales person serval times in between. First was, it got delayed to end of March because it's oversea. This was around mid March. As I needed the furniture before April, I thought I'd give them some slack, so I waited.
Fast forward to 3/29, word is it got delayed again to mid April. So I called the sales person to express my anger about the broken promise and that I'd like to return the order and get my money back. She just said sorry there is nothing she can do... Then the manager called me back to say he will figure out a way and give me an answer by the end of March.
Now it's the end of March, no call back from the manager, no call back from the sales person. Nothing.
This place is full of lies. Don't trust any word from these people.

TLDR: sales person repeatedly promised delivery date, 1 month passed and nothing show up. Store manager called saying he will have answer in 2 days, no call back. FULL OF LIES.</text>

<text>I give 5 stars for the furniture quality but 1 star for the way they changed up the prices on delivery and the way they make you join this stupid club they got now for $69 that way we can get lower prices on delivery and some other dumb perks but they should just give the customers that regardless instead of making us pay $69 to get perks!🙁🤷 this will most likely be my last purchase< /text><user_id>113439740814849312856</user_id><username>Jennie Contreras</username><Response>{'time': 1553259884260, 'text': 'Thanks for the 5-Stars Jennie!'}< /Response>< Rating>

From the greeting people in the lobby, specially Jenny,to almost all  the sales people in the store Carol Lum, to the customer service Lailani and Deborah, who handle my issue and to the delivery people Tony and the other guy, who replaces my recliner...you guys are awesome. This kind of service are almost extinct now. This is my first purchase from Matthis Bros, and from now on, when I need a furniture, I will go to your store first 'coz I know I am very unlikely to visit another store ! Save me time and money. ***** (5 star)to you guys. Can I add 1 more *?< /Text>

From 1st to Worst!
My girlfriend and I recently bought our sectional couch from Mathis Brothers in Ontario and had a GREAT shopping experience with salesman Ray Santos who helped us with our selection. The rest of our experience has been a total nightmare dealing with Mathis Brothers. The delivery guys damaged the sectional by almost completing tearing off the dust cover under the sectional, when asked if they where going to repair the damage they said they forgot their staple gun and would have their service department contact us.

After 4 days and no response we contacted Mathis Brothers and was transferred back and forth for over 30 minutes before being transferred back to the original customer service person who took the call. I had to tell her not to transfer again. She took my purchase info  and did nothing with it, after another week went by no response from Mathis Brothers we asked a relative to help us fix the sectional, which he did.  So like I said GREAT initial service with sales and WORST experience with customer services and service department. Would recommend caution when purchasing with Mathis Brothers.<//review>

The sales staff, especially Roya Nikdel, are very experienced.  The ability to return items which don't match the existing decor is great.<//text>

<review>Biggest show room and more visual options than any other furniture store in the vicinity including; Living Spaces, Jerome's and Furniture Restoration Outlet at the Mills.  The prices are unbeatable.  I price matched EVERYWHERE (even online) before I went to MB and I was pleasantly surprised at how bottom line the prices are.  They do not negotiate on price because they don't have to.  I realized as soon as I made my first walk through that I would be purchasing from MB because of the available options, Quality and PRICE.  Delivery fee VERY reasonable and the customer service is unbeatable.  Follow up phone calls for delivery schedule confirmation, call when delivery in route and follow up call to confirm delivery.  Our leather sofas are PIMP!  And we are very picky when it comes to quality.  A weeee bit of a negative is that our sales associate was breathing down our neck for a bit so I asked him politely to give my wife and I some privacy, and he did.  EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!  And NO I do not work for MB nor was I paid for this review.  LOL.  My sofa had a little knick in it, probably happened during delivery.  I called customer service and they delivered a replacement the next day!  Like, am I sleeping?  Seriosuly.  They earn their business.</review>< user>

<Review>Salesmen lied to me about warranty of the sofa I was looking at. Made several other false claims and then they can't deliver to my location unless I book it out like a week in advance. These people are clowns. no one there has a clue what is going on. I won't be back! Really disappointed that Scott hasn't fixed these issues yet!</Review>< Pics>

I ordered a custom couch September 2016. At the time of the order I was impressed how helpful the salesman, Kevin Worley was. When my couch finally arrived in November the order was completely wrong. I refused delivery and of course called my salesman.  He said he would check on it the next day however I never received a callback. When I called him again the following day to inquire as to the status of my couch, his response was "why are you calling me, it is my day off.  Call service."  Ok then why in the hell did he give me his business card?  I called service and explained my situation. I felt like service was treating me like what I had received was the couch I ordered when it was obviously wrong; wrong style and wrong color of pillows. After being left on hold for 15 minutes, the service Manager Sung Ching said he would look into it and will definitely call me by noon the following day. After again not receiving a callback the following day and again asking service about the couch, the next response received was that the service manager was busy and would check the couch in the warehouse later.  Not until the third day did the service manager call me back and apologized about the error. Not until that time did I feel I was receiving any kind of positive customer service. The couch was re-ordered and it is beautiful.  I received it yesterday.  I was very disappointed in the customer service until they realized it was entirely MB error. As far as Mr Worley, wow I was astonished as to his lack of willingness to help. I guess he received his commission and was done with me. Will I shop Mathis Brothers again?  I honestly don't know.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>My daughter and I had been to the Lazyboy store in Sprigdale to look at sleeper sofas . We later decided to purchase her a Leah sleeper sofa. She lives in Northwest Arkansas and I live in Northeast Arkansas. I purchased the sofa online and was told the sofa would be available for pick up in 6 weeks. This was in
February. I spoke with an associate named Lenora. She told me to sign a form that she was sending and the order would be placed. When I received the order confirmation. I realized that there was nothing for me to sign so I immediately responded to her that I did. NOt receive the form to sign but that she has my permission to order the couch. We heard nothing more from her. In early April my daughter called Lenore to find out when to expect the couch. She proceeded to tell her that it had never been ordered becUse I did not sign the form. They however did not hesitate to take the full payment for the couch. We went back and forth for over a month . The couch finally was available  in June but instead of the couch being sent to Springdale Arkansas it was sent to Tulsa Oklahoma. We then had to wait another week to pick it up after it was transported to Springdale. After we received the couch it did not have the mattress we wanted so my daughter called them back and explained the whole situation to Justin  . She mentioned to him how Lenore had also written on the pick up slip nasty comments about me. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL!!!  Justin said he would order the correct mattress but we have called him 4 times and have left messages for him to call back . He has not yet returned the phone calls. Needless to say, this was my first and last purchase I will ever make from this company</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>When I went to Mathis brothers to look for beds I was amazed how the employees are very helpful. It was such a nice experience to shop at this store. I was directed to the expert on the item I wanted to buy. Ithe first sales person who approached me was knowledgeable. I told him I want to think it over and will come back. He gav another name to ask for in case he is not around.  I came back after 2 days and asked for Ramon and he wa in yet but another person helped me while I was waiting for Ramon. Ramon wa very detail explaining the different beds. I am so pleased with their customer service.

Bottomline I bought 2 beds instead of 1. I am so happy from the time I went to the store until the  beds were delivered. I would definitely recommend Mathis to those who would like to buy any furniture

FIVE STARS FOR MATHIS BROTHERS!!!!

CUSTOMER SERVICE EXCELLENT!!!!!<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
The Ontario store is huge and can be overwhelming, but ask for Amna Babar. She is patient, doesn't hover, lets you think about your decisions, offers great suggestions, and makes the shopping experience enjoyable. I don't care for shopping - I have a hard time making decisions, but Amna kindly guided us as needed but left us alone when we needed time to think. No pressure. Our furniture is very new, so I can't attest to its durability, but as for a good shopping experience, I was very pleasantly surprised. We have now been back twice and I know that's where we're going the next time we have furniture to purchase.<//Review>

I had hoped a showroom of this size would be a real winner for our furniture purchases. We recently bought a new house and have many items we need. Our first impression was positive. There is a large selection and a variety of prices. Yes, it appeared that there is also a large variety of quality, but that is to be expected. Also to be expected is that your shopping experience will not be private. A salesperson will attach themselves to you almost immediately and follow you around the store to answer any questions you may have. They are polite and knowledgeable, but it still feels a little intrusive.

Our first purchase was a media center for our family room. One item in the set had to be special ordered, so I was warned it might take up to 12 weeks to receive our delivery. However, it was ready in four weeks and delivered conveniently to my home. Unfortunately, one item in the set was damaged and had to be replaced. Customer service apologized and said they would replace the item as quickly as possible and ordered a new one to be delivered a week later.

I was hoping for a quicker response, but I was at least satisfied that it would be handled professionally. So I went back for a second purchase. This time I did NOT have a good salesperson. He talked me into ordering furniture that was not available to see on the showroom floor. When I went to pick it up it was in boxes and needed to be assembled. I was not told this originally, but I accepted the order anyway. When I got home, unpacked everything and assembled it, I was not satisfied with what I saw. I called immediately and asked how I could return the merchandise.

I was told I could return it assembled and that I would be charged a 10% restocking fee. Shouldn't I be charging them 10% for assembly? I informed the customer service representative that I found a restocking fee unacceptable given that I was not able to preview the item on the showroom floor. I was told coldly that this was a corporate policy and nothing could be done. I was offered the opportunity to have them keep my money and give me store credit toward my next unfulfilling purchase.

I responded that warehouse stores like Costco and higher-end retail stores like Nordstrom  and Pottery Barn have exceptional customer service policies, which is why customers keep coming back. I asked which store Mathis Brothers aspired to become.

In the end, they can keep my 10% restocking fee with my thanks. I've learned a very valuable lesson early in my customer relationship. I'm thankful they only got 10% of a smaller purchase, before I spent my savings with them on furnishing the rest of my house.

I won't be back, and I cannot recommend this store to anyone else. Go where they appreciate your return patronage and want to build a long-term customer relationship rather than make a quick buck at your expense.<//Text>

Salesmen lied to me about warranty of the sofa I was looking at. Made several other false claims and then they can't deliver to my location unless I book it out like a week in advance. These people are clowns. no one there has a clue what is going on. I won't be back! Really disappointed that Scott hasn't fixed these issues yet!<//Review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>2 months after purchase and no furniture! I am so disappointed in my ongoing nightmare with Mathis Brothers in Ontario, CA. Being a repeat customer I thought maybe that might mean something, but it didn't. We originally purchased a high-end recliner and a TWO sofa and loveseat combos on Nov 30 of 2015. Order totaled over $4000. Salesman (who is no longer with the company) told us one of the sofas was not in stock but promised it would be delivered within two weeks (by Dec 15). The recliner, leather sofa and loveseat, and other loveseat were delivered within a week. I called back to confirm delivery of our missing sofa and I am told it will be another month (Jan 15) until delivery. I told them that wasn't acceptable and I'd like to return the loveseat and get something in stock to take home. I went in, picked another sofa and loveseat and they promised it would be in by Jan 3. So I figure it's a month after we paid 4K and I'll just bite the bullet and wait another 2 weeks with the new choice. I call them Jan 2 and the second sofa and loveseat not only are NOT in stock, they won't be in until Jan 30! I call today (Jan 30), and am told they still don't have my sofa and loveseat! Meantime, it's been 60 days, $4000 spent, 2 broken promises, and I still don't have my furniture. How can you treat customers this way and not make it right?! Unbelievable. Poor customer service. Poor public relations. Poor management.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1454362568956, 'text': 'John - We completely understand the aggravation with the delays in your living room furniture.

David, not sure his last name because the tags do not say, was the rudest snob I have ever met. First off he did not introduce himself, I introduced myself. When I had told him that the item I was looking at was a little more expensive than I was looking for, he said, "Later." Very rude, I went home and found a great deal online for what I wanted and the deliver is free. David is a Caucasian, maybe 5' 9" middle-aged guy, please discipline him, because I was very unimpressed with his attitude.< /review>

Always look at the tag. They charged us for a full leather recliner and the tag had no leather ingredients just polyester and vinyl. We are in the process of getting a refund or charged correctly for the error, now customer service is saying it's our fault that we had the wrong impression that it was not full leather only the sat</Text>

Omg! This place is so bad! Their service is humiliating. I called trying to order a loveseat and 2 Sale reps were so bad one just tranfered me to someone else apparently because the item was not in stock but he acted as if he was mad. The second one didn't even speak good English and didn't understand when I was spelling the sku for him. And when I asked for his name he refused to give me the name and hang up the phone on me. Third time a I call asking for the manager all frustrated and another lady sales rep answers and refuses to transfer me to the manager because according to her she could help me. Anyway, this place is horrible. If you need anything don't call!! Just go and don't any idiot be in your ass, that's all they know to  do!<//Review>

2 months after purchase and no furniture! I am so disappointed in my ongoing nightmare with Mathis Brothers in Ontario, CA. Being a repeat customer I thought maybe that might mean something, but it didn't. We originally purchased a high-end recliner and a TWO sofa and loveseat combos on Nov 30 of 2015. Order totaled over $4000. Salesman (who is no longer with the company) told us one of the sofas was not in stock but promised it would be delivered within two weeks (by Dec 15). The recliner, leather sofa and loveseat, and other loveseat were delivered within a week. I called back to confirm delivery of our missing sofa and I am told it will be another month (Jan 15) until delivery. I told them that wasn't acceptable and I'd like to return the loveseat and get something in stock to take home. I went in, picked another sofa and loveseat and they promised it would be in by Jan 3. So I figure it's a month after we paid 4K and I'll just bite the bullet and wait another 2 weeks with the new choice. I call them Jan 2 and the second sofa and loveseat not only are NOT in stock, they won't be in until Jan 30! I call today (Jan 30), and am told they still don't have my sofa and loveseat! Meantime, it's been 60 days, $4000 spent, 2 broken promises, and I still don't have my furniture. How can you treat customers this way and not make it right?! Unbelievable. Poor customer service. Poor public relations. Poor management.<//text>

<date>1361138837222< /date><Rating>2< /Rating><review>This has been a nightmare working with the Ontario Mathis Brothers customer service department. We purchased a sofa and loveseat at Mathis Brothers about two years ago and also bought the extended warranty in the event either piece would break. The recliner loveseat broke in about two years. We were given a store credit since the existing furniture was not repairable, so we upgraded and paid extra for a better quality sofa and loveseat. Throughout our dealings by phone and in person to select a new set of furniture, we were NEVER told, either orally from our numerous phone calls or in writing as we were arranging the purchase, that the old furniture (which we paid for in full and was ours) needed to be returned in order to get the store credit, which we purchased the warranty to cover. No written requirement for the old furniture was communicated, and even when I spoke with their delivery representative the day before delivery, I was told "we don't take the old furniture" so we had a family who needed them pick them up before the delivery. Mathis Brothers would not leave our new furniture without taking the old furniture, which we already paid for and was ours to give away, and had already paid for the $200 extended coverage. We spoke with customer service rep, Jazime and Michelle and received the worst experience we have ever had in trying to help us resolve the issue. Along with using words like "stupid" because our understanding of store credit wasn't hers ("you only get a store credit if you bring back what was broken") which is contrary to most others definition of a store credit. After thinking we couldn't have any worse experience with Mathis Brothers, we then spoke with a Supervisor named Jonathan Arnold who had to be the worst representative Mathis Brothers could have hired. Along with implying we were "liars", he was not even willing to discuss options to salvage our experience. We currently have a pending purchase for additional furniture that we will no longer be pursuing because of the terrible and condescending service we just experienced this morning. Speaking with Operations Manager Laura Canon, who said we would be considered "thieves" by not giving them the old broken furniture and saying and I quote: "Their is no customer service dealing with you people". I can only warn others that aside from a simple transaction where no executive decisions have to me made, buyer beware!! Mathis Brothers has lost two faithful customers who would have been loyal customers for future purchases. This is by far the WORST experience I have ever had! If I could've scored them "Less than Poor" I would have!!!</review>< Pics>

< review>
This has been a nightmare working with the Ontario Mathis Brothers customer service department. We purchased a sofa and loveseat at Mathis Brothers about two years ago and also bought the extended warranty in the event either piece would break. The recliner loveseat broke in about two years. We were given a store credit since the existing furniture was not repairable, so we upgraded and paid extra for a better quality sofa and loveseat. Throughout our dealings by phone and in person to select a new set of furniture, we were NEVER told, either orally from our numerous phone calls or in writing as we were arranging the purchase, that the old furniture (which we paid for in full and was ours) needed to be returned in order to get the store credit, which we purchased the warranty to cover. No written requirement for the old furniture was communicated, and even when I spoke with their delivery representative the day before delivery, I was told "we don't take the old furniture" so we had a family who needed them pick them up before the delivery. Mathis Brothers would not leave our new furniture without taking the old furniture, which we already paid for and was ours to give away, and had already paid for the $200 extended coverage. We spoke with customer service rep, Jazime and Michelle and received the worst experience we have ever had in trying to help us resolve the issue. Along with using words like "stupid" because our understanding of store credit wasn't hers ("you only get a store credit if you bring back what was broken") which is contrary to most others definition of a store credit. After thinking we couldn't have any worse experience with Mathis Brothers, we then spoke with a Supervisor named Jonathan Arnold who had to be the worst representative Mathis Brothers could have hired. Along with implying we were "liars", he was not even willing to discuss options to salvage our experience. We currently have a pending purchase for additional furniture that we will no longer be pursuing because of the terrible and condescending service we just experienced this morning. Speaking with Operations Manager Laura Canon, who said we would be considered "thieves" by not giving them the old broken furniture and saying and I quote: "Their is no customer service dealing with you people". I can only warn others that aside from a simple transaction where no executive decisions have to me made, buyer beware!! Mathis Brothers has lost two faithful customers who would have been loyal customers for future purchases. This is by far the WORST experience I have ever had! If I could've scored them "Less than Poor" I would have!!!< /review>

I spent around $4,000 on a sofa, an additional $175 for delivery and they can't even accommodate a morning delivery. Instead I received a 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm time frame. To even schedule anything after 8:00 pm is rude!!!  When I called to ask about the late delivery the female manager hung up on me!!!!!! This is all after the dimwitted salesperson called me and said that "I FORGOT TO PICK A FABRIC FOR MY PILLOWS!!" Really, isn't that her job to inform me that I needed to pick one! Again, I will NEVER purchase from them again!!<//Review></record>

It's average the furniture quality is good but expensive and sometimes bad customer service.</Text>

Horrible!!  wish i didnt have to give 1 star!! they lie to you about the insurance covering everything. (it wont cover a move) but they want you to lie to the insurance company about it. then when they do cover something they have nothing in that price range anymore you have to spend another $200 just for a table the same size! NOT worth it find a company that cares about the customers!<//text>

This place must hire its sales staff from the same place car dealerships find theirs. Like sharks waiting for their pray to fall in the water, very obvious they are commissioned sales staff. Not my cup of tee, I will not visit this store ever again.<//review>

Follow through here is horrible. Once they get your deposit on any items they will never reach out to you. Trying to get a manager on the phone is impossible. This is one of the worst places I've ever tried to do business with.< /Review>

It's huge and they have EVERYTHING
If you can't find what you are looking for there, then it's a big possibility for you to stay without a furniture for such a long time.< /review>

<gmap_id>0x80c33577d03fc169:0x50877c0484aa9131<//gmap_id><text>(Translated by Google) I moved the furniture I bought here in my new home, and there was a bunk bed I bought for my children. Then I placed it in the house for more than a month and had not slept because the smell of the new bed was too big and pungent. Then it is to communicate with the after-sales. First of all, we can drag on. We insist on calling, and later promised to return, wait, continue to wait, and finally the bed was returned, and the mattress could not be returned. It took another month. Let's talk about this after-sales attitude. What we started to contact was a person who could speak Chinese. We thought that our compatriots were easy to communicate. Later, we were wrong and changed a foreigner. It was even more powerful! Overall, the quality of his furniture is good, but it is this after-sales that makes me feel again that I am dealing with the relevant departments.

我搬新家在这买的家具，其中有一张给孩子买的双层床，然后就摆在那屋一个多月没睡过，因为新床的味太大了，刺鼻的味。然后就是跟售后沟通，先是能拖就拖，我们坚持打电话，后来答应给退，等，继续等，最后床退了，床垫不能退。又用时一个多月。咱就说这售后态度，我们开始联系的是会说汉语的，认为同胞好沟通，后来我们错了，换了个老外，更厉害！ 总体来说他家家具质量不错，但就是这售后，让我又一次感觉到我在跟有关部门打交道。<//text></record></dataset><record>
