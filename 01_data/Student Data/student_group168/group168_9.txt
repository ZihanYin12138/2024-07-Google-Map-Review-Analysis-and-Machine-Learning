Good service, great pizza, especially for the price. The staff are usually friendly & fast. This particular location is also near a Safeway & a Walmart, so you can grab extra fancy toppings to add to your pizza nearby if that's your sort of thing.

I would highly recommend ordering ahead on their website, not only to skip much of the wait, but also because they tend to have coupon codes you can take advantage of.<//text>

Staff is always friendly and the store is always clean. The food is always delicious. However this is not the first (or second) time my order was wrong...
Today I ordered half cheese with red sauce and half gourmet veggie with creamy garlic sauce. I picked up my pizza and the sauce was half and half, but the whole pizza had the veggie toppings. They offered to remake it and I said no, I don't want the pizza to be thrown away, I can just move the veggies to one side. The staff assured me the pizza would not be wasted so I agreed to wait again for a remade pizza.
After 10 minutes my remade pizza was ready. It was more like 70/30. And the price for the whole pie is the more expensive half. I did not want to wait a third time so I took it home.<//text>

<rating>1<//rating><name>Leigh Malcolm</name><Text>I stop here every once in a while because of the double stuffed pizzas, but the customer service is atrocious. The first time I encountered the girl at the register (I truly wish I had paid attention to name tags) I assumed maybe it was a bad day, but after several encounters with her and now seeing her manager treat another customer like dirt in front of the whole store, I've realized that they are just rude people who don't care about their store's image or their customers. I do apologize to any employees of this establishment who treat customers with respect.< /Text>< UserId.>

Called our order in, the phone service was a little snappy and the gal was short. However, she took our order accurately, and we always enjoy our pizzas from this restaurant.< /Review>

<text>Papa Murphy's is famous food it's we make you bake concept.  I placed a phone order for 2 family size pizzas,  one from their menu and another my special toppings.   I picked up my order, from start to pick up,  in 30mins. Their pizzas are in the expensive side but they tasted great.  Their service staff are nice, friendly and courteous.   I would definitely come back again.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Papa Murphy's Murphy's make their own pizza and they're very very good. They also make salads and they also do cheese bread and salads and they have a cookie dough and chocolate chip dough and drinks. Staff is very friendly. I went later tonight and there was only one staff working but she certainly knew how to put out the pizzas and do her job she did excellent. I need to get her name though. Try it you'll like it< /Review>

Thin blond haired younger lady at this location was extremely rude. I ordered a pizza and when I went in to pick it up she practically tossed the pizza at me as I said thank you. She completely ignored the thank you and turned away from me. Living up on the hill im pretty put off when I receive undeserved rudeness especially in such a quaint little town. On the other note the pizza was ok.<//review>

I ordered online, specifically choose a Cowboy, then added extra pepperoni, green onions, white sauce and chopped garlic. What I received is a white sauce, single pepperoni and green onions, absolutely nothing else. When my wife calls to complain, she is told that the person making the order didn't see the rest. So I go down personally, and take the messed up pizza with me, and show the exact order as confirmed to me both online and in an email confirmation, both of which list EVERY item to be on the pizza, and the supposed manager makes an excuse that the person making it "didn't see the order as a Cowboy, but only saw the add-ons" (major attitude as well), and shows me the order tag that they printed, which PLAINLY says COWBOY and goes on to list the added ingredients. So, I ask is the person not able to read? And then I get accused of being rude and degrading.....< /Text>

Pizza was just alright. The thing that really brought this score down was the fact that i called in my order and they told me it would be ready in 15-20 minutes. It ended up taking them a full hour and fifteen minutes after i called to make it. Needless to say i was not happy about that.</text>

< review>
I would be careful with Ibralim. He sold us tires for 1200....( They were cheaper anywhere else first of all for 800). We didn't know we were being charged a fee to finance and then he told us if we paid off in three months, we would be charged at no interest rate! Guess what this whole time we have been. It's been about 90 days and when I tried to pay so I wouldn't get charged interest, I find out I have been.  I will definitely take this higher. We weren't even shown paperwork of what it is we were signing, we were just told to sign. He was highly recommended off a friend
What a shame!Not a way to do business. I will definitely take it above him< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><review>BEWARE GROUPON USERS!!!!!!!!!! This place uses groupons for a good part of its revenue. I purchased two groupons good for brake services. When my daughter arrived to get the service, we were told it would be EXTRA to turn the rotors $30 apiece. Who does a brake job and not turn the rotors? It's part of doing a brake job. It's like buying a hamburger and being told it will be extra if you want it on a bun. This place is a joke, DO NOT TRUST ANYONE to work on your car and willing to charge you for half a job done. Your safety and your loved one's safety should be supreme. I wish I could rate ZERO STARS for ZERO acknowledgment!!< /review>< Pictures>

<pics>None< /pics><Text>If I could give this place a ZERO I would. Don't waste your time or your money! I took my vehicle in for an engine to be replaced. I didn't officially get it back for 2 MONTHS! They had it the first time for three weeks, have it back to us said it was fixed, the car died the same day. They took it back and claimed the engine was defective, then kept it for an additional MONTH and A WEEK! I lost my job, they wouldn't provide a rental car for the whole 2 months!! The owner claimed to know nothing of the issue, only after  requesting $4,000 back he finally got involved. When I finally got it back he sent me a Message detailing how he lost over $4,000 for labor cost, and parts.
Not even a week later the "service engine soon" light came on.... So they've pretty much ruined my car I'm still making payments on... And this WASN'T a BMW... just a basic Nissan ... Don't.send.your.car.here.< /Text>< rating>

Huge thanks to Wayne & his crew in Bakersfield! I’ve been doing business with West Coast for over a decade in Fresno & I’m located in LA now so I was happy to hear that there was a location in Bakersfield so I didn’t have to drive as far because my brakes & rotors were shot!!! Wayne is the man! I’ll definitely be coming up from LA to do all the maintenance on my car from here on out! Customer service is everything & Wayne delivered! See you next time!<//review>

I was doing my research before going out and have a ton of work done on a car. I went and got quotes from all the larger tire centers here in town and then i saw west coast tires and went inside. I left with a quote for better tires at a lot less price then the other guys. Their customer service is better than anyone else in town. You guys have my buisness for life.</review>

Had some work done on my car last week. Manager or who ever he is at the desk is rude and he talks to his employees in a rude way. He didn't seem happy to work there at all. Young boy in the back with the glasses fixed my car fast and I was in and out. Not sure if I will return do to how the environment is in there. And in this heat there was not water in the jug for the customers. There's more to say but I don't want to go full rant..< /text>

This place is no good. I bought my wife an alignment through Groupon and they redeemed it knowing their machine was down. They kept telling my wife to call back for about 2 weeks until she finally got it done. While she was there, one technician told her she needed new front brakes when I had just replaced the rotors and pads a week prior. Trying to take advantage of women does not go over well with me. The manager then told her they would give her a free oil change when it was time for her next oil change to compensate for the 2 weeks it took to do the alignment and not being able to refund us our money because they already redeemed the certificate. She just left there and it is now “under new management” and they refused to give her the oil change they promised. It is still under the same owner, and they will not back up their promise. This place left a bad taste in my mouth and they will not be gettig any future business... horrible customer service and even worse management.<//text>

West cost automotive
Well to start I placed an ad on craigslist looking for help in check engine light a gentlemen replied to me and said I have a bmw mechanic on standby bring it over and we will check it out for you at no cost ...so I did when I brought it over they had my car for close to 4 to 5 hours and said they couldn't find anything they said they added a fuel cleaner to the tank and they reset the light 50 or so miles down the road light comes back on so I said hell with it went and purchased a code ready and diagnosed it myself found out it was gas cap and a couple solenoids in a tune-up so I did the repairs myself week later my water pump goes bad so what do I do I have it towed to west cost auto the repair the water pump and I paid  240 or so in cash that day was happy car back on the road...4 months later brakes go bad what do I do drive it back to west cost for brake work ..sway the manager at the time ..I walk in and say hey I'm back again for repairs sway says I remember you then proceed to tell me a story of the prior manager Chris was stealing checks from people and that just freaked me out so I blew up on then asking them I hope my information wasn't involved and they said no ...sway did everything he could to calm me down I proceeded to get the brake work done this time I had to finance the repairs...brakes where never the same after that and are still not I took it back they warranty the front...8 months later my rear differential goes out ...wow I sence a pattern going on here...I gave them the benefit of the doubt and refinance the work over 2 grand and purchased 2 new tires they had my vehicle over 3 weeks on this repair 4 months later my rear differential is make noises and asked for sway ..sway no longer works there hum...wonder why point is this company purposely screwed with certain parts of my vehicle to go bad they are extremely crooked and I will be protesting about them and will blast this company all over facebook... and the better business bureau I'm going to be going back and forcing them to repair my car ar no cost what so ever...<//Review>

They did my oil change and put wrong filter.   My car engine lost all oil and I continued to drive on freeway.   Whole engine got heated and car got full of smoke.  It was very scary and dangerous.  Luckily engine survived.  I had to get car towed and fixed.   Never go there as it may happen to you , too.< /Text>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>Incredibly disappointing experience with the GM. Tried to book our party in advance, with no communication from their end for months, even after emails and calls later.  Finally, I heard back. The sad, melancholy voice on the other end of the line could hardly converse. I hope they find their social stride again and work to provide sophisticated and elegant solutions with their future customers. I used to enjoy this spot, but can no longer recommend based on the unprofessional manner, and neglect.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Highly recommend the Pork Tomahawk. Served sliced with 2 Bones along with mashed potatoes. My husband said it was the best meal he ever had.  He let me try the bone which was amazing! I had Alaskan Halibut which was delicious, but not a 5. Fit a side of the bread and butter. The butter was so delicious!   I’d say this is a great place even during Covid- we had to eat in parking lot though much preferred than the sidewalk which is next to the street. Next time I’m going fir the pork!!</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOpzyeE_JPqMceFPo5jNLW3vIFqNcBKdI8JSH6U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOJnai7Jgec6Jveb1X55EVorUU6VvkQqgAcv1ym=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

Truly a small piece of French taste in Paso. Creative and fresh food prepared just right. This evening I had a wonderful summer salad of heirloom tomatoes, compressed watermelon and basil, and perfectly cooked duck breast.

My wife had Dungeness crab salad she loved and Alaskan Halibut with a beautiful sauce. We'll be back in a couple of days!</text>

We only had a late, small dinner. The excellent bread and butter as a first bite. Then I had the Beef Tartare and my wife the Octopus. Both really excellent.
We ended the evening with the Valrhona Chocolate cake, I like the whipped Creme Fraiche with the dark chocolate.
Very nice small dinner. Will certainly come back for a full meal. I definitely want to try the Pork Tomahawk!</Review>

I haven’t been to all of Paso’s restaurants, but so far this is the best, by a lot. Really awesome, thoughtful, anticipatory service. Every dish we’ve had has been delicious. Especially that pork chop...slam!

Cool wine list with international selections that Jeff has a great hold on.

Keep up the good work!<//text>

Chef Julien knows what he’s doing and I pretty much go to Paso to come here. I live 5 hours away and every time I come to LPC, I transcend immediately to heaven. Highly recommend the tartare, hangar steak, tarte tartin, really anything and everything on their menu you can’t go wrong with. Needless to say I would consider myself a LPC super fan!< /review><Name>Thomas Columbus</Name><Gmap_id>0x80ecc5a95a89bbc3:0x286b97816108aac6<//Gmap_id>< time>

Loved everything about this place! We sat at the bar and ordered wines by the glass to pair with the variety of dishes we chose. Kumomoto oysters with  Vouvray was the perfect start, followed by a delicate Caesar salad with tiny whole anchovies. For main courses, the Local Black Cod and the Steak Frites were both delicious and perfectly prepared. The wine list is extensive and carefully chosen, a mix of Paso Robles and European producers. Everyone on the staff was friendly and knowledgeable.< /review>

<Text>The Caesar salad was the best I've had.  The appetizers were also great.  There were four of us and everyone loved their entres, beef bourgogne, black cod and mussels.  We tried 4 different deserts and all were big hits.  The service was excellent. We had a fun time and great food.

Went there after seeing it on the NYT top 52 places to visit. This was for the wife's birthday.

The atmosphere is nice - it is a little too loud in there though.

They have an extensive wine list. Seems like a lot of the wines are from the owner's family's vineyards / wineries. The beer menu is very limited though, if that's your choice of alcohol.
We got the cab and the Shiraz, and both were _very_ good. Paso Robles!

The food menu is small -ish, which makes it easier for someone like me (I get overwhelmed by choice). BUT, they were out of a couple of items that I was eyeing (whole fish, and rabbit). Apparently this large table had ordered it all. #sigh.

We ended up getting the soup of the day, the Caesar salad, olives, and two entrees (beef cheek, and the steak frites). The soup, salad, and olives were really good. I wish the salad was a larger portion though (what you see in the photo is a half portion, to be fair). The beef cheek dish was yummy too - the meat was falling off with every scoop. Very fatty though. The steak frites were alright. I'm personally not a big fan of steaks, which maybe why I wasn't impressed. We subbed the fries for a bowl of grilled brussel sprouts for an extra $4.
Overall, I wish they had more non beef options. A couple of chicken dishes or one more fish dish (which doesn't easily run out by 7 PM) would be great!</Review>

<Review>Delicious Mexican food, been going there for 5 years, get the chicharrones, fried pork rinds. I have never ordered a lot for home from the deli, but I usually get the quesadilla or burrito for lunch, and their meat, specifically the carnitas, and beans are always amazing.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Excellent food at a great price. It's casual like fast food, but home cooking flavor. Sit down or take out available. The market part seems like authentic Mexican foods and treats. There's a butcher counter in the back. A wide array of hot sauce in case you like a challenge.<//review>

<text>While I do enjoy the food. I had a terrible experience customer service wise today. I  called in my order a large super burrito and 6 tacos. When I ordered I asked for extra jalepenos. 30 mins of waiting  after I a rrived I finally receive my food and there's no extra jalepenos. I asked the lady who handed me my bag for extra jalepenos and she told me sorry we can't do that. I've been given extra jalepenos on every occasion that I've ever been there. If you can't serve jalepenos to me, I'm not sure I can support your business.<//text><Rate>3< /Rate>< user_name>

So glad we found this place. Each time we drive through we are going to stop. The veggie burrito was simple and exactly what I miss about Southern California.</review>

I ordered a super burrito con asada and I came home to unwrap a regular burrito con carnitas, I don't eat pork so I was already irritated, then I look at my tamales it's dry and falling apart inside, I go back to the store and they tell me carnitas and carne are the same as if I'm stupid and illiterate. Not only can I read the menu in front of me , I'm dominican I speak Spanish don't judge a book by its cover, they remade my burrito and put the same tamale in a new container😑 will not be returning!!!</Text>

Groceries and little restaurant inside. They charge for extra salsas and most of the time get your order wrong. Used to be very inexpensive but they increased the prices . They sell meats, mexican candies, cold drinks, and also alcohol.</Text>

Cynthia helped my sister and I get car insurance. She is very professional and friendly. She quickly found the best insurance for our needs at a very reasonable price. She answered all of our questions. We had an amazing experience with her! I definitely recommend Cynthia.<//review>

Hello Fresno...I want to share my experience buying insurance from Quick
Buy.  Their prices are affordable, the
young ladies Cynthia and Amanda are both very friendly but professional.
Cynthia wasn't pushy very easy to speak to,  and I felt confident in her expertise

I was shopping around for an insurance for my husband's cars and I couldn't find anyone to get an amazing quote for 2 vehicles until I came across quickbuy and called and spoke to cynthia she then told me to come by and she hooked me up with a great deal! I was there for less than an hour and she explained everything to me and was so kind. I definitely recommend her and this insurance shell find great deals for you all! Call today and ask for Cynthia!!</Review>

I saw the QuickBuy van outside so I went in just to check it out. The atmosphere was great. I was greeted upon entering the office and they were very friendly throughout my visit. They even answered all of my questions. I was hesitant to even get a quote at the beginning but after learning so much of what they had to offer, as for auto insurance rates and the different companies I could choose from, I had to get a quote just to see. I would highly recommend QuickBuy, as they opened my eyes on how "insurance" worked in general (coverage, limitations, etc.). Very knowledgeable and friendly staff!<//text>

<username>Francisco Guzman<//username><date>1422251909961<//date><rating>4<//rating><Text>I found these guys through google and got a quote over the phone and it sounded pretty cool so I decided to go into their office.  When I got there the lady was pretty cool with going over all the different coverage's making sure i knew exactly how insurance worked.  I thought I knew exactly what I wanted but after that it didn't sound like something that I wanted so I decided to up my coverage's.  Now I feel like I am properly Insured.  I'm glad I called these guys cause if I didn't who knows what the other guys would of sold me.

There monthly payment was pretty low plus the down was a lot less then those other guys I got insurance from last time.  Those other guys were twice as expensive on their down payment and plus it was the same insurance company that I got from quickbuy.  Makes no sense why it would be higher on the down payment in one place and then lower on another place especially when its with the same company.

Overall I think I got a great price and the service was pretty quick to.  If I didn't have to wait 10 minutes, I would definitely give this place a 5 star so I'm only giving it a four, but I'll recommend them to my friends and family.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1432843615992, 'text': "Thank you Francisco for the kind words and the opportunity to serve your insurance needs.

Beautiful  place super clean everyone at night comes out here to hangout and party you will see a few bomb fires and cheerful people I can stay here for hours just watching the waves go by you have to walk to the beach to get to it but if you don't have a problem with that it will be paradise for you<//Text>

Nice place to take the family. Some spots are more crowded then others. People just need to put there dogs on there leashes when coming close to people. Not everyone feels comfortable around animals, especially with kids around.</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Samoa Beach is one of my favorite beaches because it's so close to the road. We always hit Samoa when we're not expecting to stay very long because it's so close to the road that you don't have to walk that long long distance just to get to the ocean so we always do that like the end of the day. Watch the sunset there which is always really nice and it's so close to being right back in town. I like most of the beaches over in Eureka anyway but Samoa is close to the Cookhouse and just a nice relaxing Beach definitely bring a sweater though.< /review>< Pictures>

< Review>
A really nice place to relax or let your dogs run around and enjoy the beach. The beach is right off the road and very easy to get to, as long as you don't make the mistake of getting stuck in the loose sand. I had a great time here, and didn't encounter any unpleasant experiences. If you're one of those idiots that complains about smokers being around, maybe you shouldn't go to a beach in Humboldt County, just saying. I also didn't spot any of these alleged "smokers", just beautiful beach as far as the eye can see!<//Review>

Various places you can pull off and park from the main road. Nice for pleasant short evening stroll. Not necessarily the beach area I would hang out for the day at. Lots of broken bits of shells. Be careful of sudden rising of water.<//text>

<Review>The beach is absolutely beautiful but do not leave anything of value or visible in your car. My window was broken into for a back pack in the back seat.

I visit this place a lot since I work close by. I like how the service is always awesome and they keep the spot neat constantly. Prices are convenient and they serve big portions.<//Review>

Definitely the best outdoor dining you'll find right now. I took my husband their for his 30th birthday, I made the reservation months in advance requesting something more private or special and offered to pay more for that. However, I do not think that they read the requests for the reservation. They also do not do anything for birthdays either. I was a little disappointed by this because the meal was awfully pricey and we've had that something extra at equivalently, if not more so, fancy restaurants for birthdays and anniversaries. The meals were great and the staff was attentive. Overall a great experience, can't wait to experience this restaurant inside where there is no wind!<//Review>

<review>Went for a Friday lunch. Melodious and soothing music, beautiful space, and warm service. The olive bread already showed the quality of the food. The veggies were so fresh and the meatballs were tastier than most of the others we had tried. You shouldn't missed the black truffle cavatelli - not only for the sake of the truffles (though that's enough) but also for the sausages! We also loved the cannolo - ultra-crispy shell with mouth-watering ricotto. Thank you, chef.</review>< pics>

Very watered down flavors.. Not what i expected, had the Tagliatelle bolognese and it just didn't have any pop, was kind of dry. Not impressed with the food.

The outdoors courtyard seating was great though, and the tiramisu was delicious. Service was ok, nothing special.</text>

My daughter has recently moved to Santa Monica & she treated me to a wonderful evening at Orto.
The food & atmosphere is top notch.
I am rating only 3 stars due to our server Silvio C.
He never introduced himself, asked if we had ever been there. Then encouraged us to order our wine, appetizer & main course all at once, saying we would wait a long time otherwise.
We saw bread baskets on other tables so as Silvio was passing our table we asked him for our bread. Ended up asking him three times! Finally a different server brought it for us.
I would also like to note that the restaurant was busy but didn’t seem to be overwhelming, Silvio acted as if he didn’t want to be there.
At the end of the meal he brought our check & literally just dropped it on the table, never thanked us or welcomed us back.
I honestly don’t ever leave reviews but felt it was necessary in this case.
Receipt # M97T for reference, September 11, 2020
Again, wonderful food & atmosphere & also must let you know that every single other employee that we had contact with was great!</review>

<Review>Lobster pasta was great!!!! We weren’t very hungry but still finished all. Tomato sauce was soooo good, and noodle was cooked perfectly! Lovely place with lovely and professional servers. Lamb chops were also very impressive. Also loved panda cotta, not too sweet, with berries on top, perfect finish.< /Review>< username>

<Text>This is our second year hosting a conference business dinner at Orto. It did. It disappoint. The owner Andrea created a custom 5-course menu based on our needs and paired with wine a selection. His flexibility made working with him effortless. The food was delicious and the portions, while small were more than sufficient. The staff were accommodating and polite. We will return.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<Review>Small Italy in Downtown Santa Monica.

Something like Orto )). We started with Carpaccio di manzo Al tartufo. Totally organic and tasty. After we were ready for pasta - the symbol of Italy. My husband chose Tagliatelle alla Bolognese, me - Spaghetti alla carbonara. And I should say it was LEGEN ... wait... DARY! Fresh tomatoes, delicious original sauces and Italian Parmesan cheese made our romantic evening.

I know that Italian food are incredible, but I didn't know how much.</Review>< pics>

The food is amazing - high quality, exceptionally prepared and served. Every bite was delicious - the appetizers, bread, pasta, main courses and desserts. Our party of 15 was blown away. Absolutely everything was great! We loved it!< /Review>

Top notch Italian restaurant. Perfect place for an intimate dinner with a loved one!

The restaurant is clean and finely detailed with stonework, curtains, and Italian herb plants.
The frosted exterior glass detail adds plenty of privacy from the sidewalk and provides an intimate feel.
The wine list provides a few options for every palette and is accompanied with a chef’s menu that offers a variety of starters, salads, pastas and entree’s to suit your appetite.
Each dish was well presented, exquisite, delicious, and hands down terrific experience from start to finish.</text>

Had a fantastic lunch here with my wife. It was mid afternoon on Sunday so the place was pretty quiet. The food was simple (says my wife) but just outstanding. Glad we found this place.</Review>

We also had three salads that were absolutely delicious but also, three entrees that were to die for: salmon; pasta with lobster & cioppino. You have to save room for dessert though, the sorbets were very fresh & tasted homemade.<//review>< pictures>

<text>We went to Orto for a family gathering. Knowing we have 2 kids with us we made the reservation early at 6pm. There was nobody else in the restaurant and we got very slow to almost no service. Strike one.

After ordering, the appetizers came out very fast and everything tasted great. However, the server didn’t even ask or wait till we are done with the dishes and started to pick up the plates while I am still eating. Strike two.

Most of us got pasta which was all very tasty. Our main complaint is not about the food but the service. I do feel bad for the cook because his talent was totally shadowed by the poor service.

When the final bill comes, I was charged automatically 20% gratuity which comes out to be almost $75. Yes, $75 for service that was almost nonexistent. We have to ask for water, for the desert menu. While I was making the reservation, setting down, during and after ordering, even till when I ask for the bill, I was never told that 20% gratuity will be added to the bill. Strike three.

We weren’t going to argue with them over the tip amount in front of my guests and I think they know that. Because of all the reasons above, we will never return to Orto again. There are restaurants with way better service in Santa Monica.<//text><Date>1532751170374</Date><UserId.>113402861516244604694<//UserId.><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Impressive is the term that applies to this brand new authentic Italian spot in downtown Santa Monica. Elevated cuisine in a dignified and classy setting.
Very creative use of the local farmers market bounty, and all things seasonal and fresh from the sea......bravo!
A meal I won't soon forget.< /review>

I made a last-minute reservation on Resy and didn't know what to expect and was very pleased. Everything about our experience was excellent: our salads were crisp and flavorful; our pastas were delicious, toothsome, and innovative (the crab pasta with the grapefruit is really good); the wine was excellent; and basil/pistachio ice cream was sumptuous; and the service was really good. Oh and they have the most amazing olive bread and extra virgin olive oil! My one tiny recommendation is that they add more wines by the bottle under $50. Surely there are some Italian wines that are good values that could be added to the list?< /review>< Time>

Snubbed at another Santa Monica 'establishment' on our 25th Wedding Anniversary, we were able to get a table at Orto without waiting. There essentially was no way our experience could have been better anywhere. Professional service, the dishes were inventive, fresh and exhibited true balance. Santa Monica has many Italian restaurants, but this one is top of the class and deserves attenzione nazionale !!</Text>

<text>Andreas is very welcoming in his newly opened Italian in former Jiraffe space. Delicious fresh greens in the asparagus salad, the salmon was beautifully served and was very tasty. Our group very much enjoyed the panna cotta and chocolate mousse desert. Excited to have a new delicious Italian in Santa Monica and we plan to frequent it.< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<date>1509201995585<//date><Review>A really special new restaurant - excellent food and wine, good atmosphere, great service. Delicious starters include octopus salad, the pasta botarga had just the right amount of salty tang, and the veal chop with mushrooms was succulent and clean. Panna cotta was the perfect dessert. A varied wine list, with good range. I think this place is set to become a Santa Monica favorite - a smaller Tar and Roses, with the advantage of being open for lunch, too - and it’s a huge upgrade from Mare, it’s predecessor here.< /Review>< Name>

This place is so sad.
Needs lots of fixing up, more donations done 😞 better food and sleeping area's for people.
Proper bathrooms too.
I hope the country figure out what needs to be done for the homeless, if they do decide to fix it up i would suggest drug testing everyone. And make it more of a family shelter...then maybe build a men's area.
And add a mini church.</Review>

<Text>My fiance and i were passing through and hungry but didn't need shelter at the time because we have a car. Was warmly welcomed in for dinner and turned away when we sat down due to not staying the night in the shelter. Very disappointing due to the fact that  to be "Christian" is to be "Christ like ". Jesus wouldnt have turned down anyone who is hungry whether they were staying or just coming through because they were hungry. This is the second shelter we have stopped at on our road trip that has turned us down for something. Next day we stopped for sack of lunch and was turned down while everyone else was welcomed in having a hot lunch. We were handed four fiber one bars and a loaf of sourdough bread. Very thankful for anything !! Not complaining about that but as Christians and a Christian ministry shouldn't we be serving Christ and not the people or for ourselves ?? Gods word is posted all over the walls in the building talking about how to walk in Gods word and to be Christ like but yet we have Servants of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ turning people down for food ??? There is seriously something wrong with this picture when this place receives plenty of donations to support feeding the hungry and giving them shelter. Out of all those who we spoke with in that building there was only one man with his heart and mind in the right place and he said to us there was plenty of food and he would be wrong to turn us down if we are hungry. He even told us to sit down and enjoy a meal...just as Jesus would have. May God Bless that man and give him his own ministry for the homeless so it is done the way Jesus would want it done. God bless< /Text><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

Mike is one of kindest people in this town! He has such a beautiful vision for people! I took my cash mob in to mob his thrift store once. The gratitude we felt is something that will warm my heart for a lifetime! He would help an injured fly if he could! Thank you Mike Justice!</Review>

I wanted to like this place so bad and I went because it had amazing reviews but i had the worst experience. The guy who did my nails cut my finger, while doing the powder manicure. I couldn’t stop bleeding for a while and he showed barely any concern. He apologized a couple of times but it didn’t feel like he was really worried. The owner or manager was there as well and still charged full price for the service. Also, the quality of the manicure was very poor, I got a bunch of bumps in my nails and the cuticles were poorly trimmed. I will never go back to that place!<//Review>

I love this place.  Clean, and great quality work.  They really take good care of you here.  There are three other nail salons close by where I live but I go out of the way to come here, because they are the best. I have been all over the valley, and this is my go to.< /Review>

< Review>
This is the best nail salon you can come to. Their service is amazing, and they always make sure you are satisfied. I always go to Kenny he is my favorite person that does my nails at Palm Nails. My nails always look amazing and i am always satisfied. It’s a very clean place, and the products they use on your nails are good quality. I get dip and it lasts for almost 4 weeks. I made the mistake and went someone else and the dip started cracking a week later.< /Review>

Oh my goodness! I've been looking for a good nail salon since I've recently moved to the desert, and hadn't had much luck on good places until I came here!. I cant believe how great of a job he did! Kenny took care of me. The entire staff was friendly, the owner was outgoing and hospitable. Kenny took his time and didnt seem to be rushing through, even tho it was past closing time. I am so so happy. I definitely will keep coming back! This is my new salon and I wont go anywhere else!< /text>

I got the Deluxe pedicure, it was amazing.  Felt so good, it will put you to sleep so nice and relaxing.  I also had my eye brows and lip and chin waxed.  Then I got my nails dipped oh my goodness truly amazing.
I recommend them highly< /text>< userid>

Best nail salon! I drive from DHS to get my nails done here, and only go here. The customer service is excellent and the nail service is better than anywhere I’ve ever gone, super detailed and they always make sure I’m happy before I leave, and they fix anything if I’m not. The owner makes you feel super welcome and the salon has a vibe that always makes me feel welcome and at home!</text>

My friends recommended this place to me so I decided to come in for a basic manicure. I’m not sure the name of the man that did my nails but he rushed through my manicure and did a totally sloppy job. They were patchy and not evenly one color. You could see the layers of all of the coats he did instead of doing each coat flesh with the other so it looked smooth. He continued to get nail polish in my cuticles and did not do a good job of cleaning it all up, I still had a lot of polish in my cuticles. After he was done I explained that I was not happy with them and asked if they could do a different color or at least have someone else do them and they were really rude and refused. In order for me to redo them I would have to pay an extra $10 even though they were absolutely terrible the first time. Everyone seems to love this place but my experience was horrible. I will not be coming back and I do not recommend them to anyone.< /text>

<text>I went for the first time a few weeks ago and it was by far the best nail salon experience iv'e had. As soon as I came in they greeted me and offered me a bottled water. Then they let me know how long the wait was. A few minutes later they updated me on the time and said they would be with me in a couple minutes. Sure enough about two minutes later I was seated to get my pedi. The staff there are super nice! Not only to the clients but you can tell they have a good relationship amongst themselves. They were professional and easy going. This is by far the cleanest nail salon I have been to. They use plastic covers for the foot tubs which I thought was super neat; I hadn't been to a saloon that does that here.</text>< pictures>

It was my Mom's first time ever getting her nails done professionally and I am so glad it was at this place. Salon was clean, staff was friendly and accommodating. The lady that did my nails worked her magic to fix another places' terrible work. 100% recommended this place.<//Text>

<Review>I had been going to the nail salon across the street for years but was always disappointed with how quickly the polish and gel would lift.  Luckily a friend told me about Palm Nails.  Jen is fantastic at gels.  I won't go anywhere else.  My gel nails last nearly a month.< /Review>< gmapID>

I've been getting mani's and pedi's for over 15 years now and have been to numerous nail salons and this by far has been the best place I have ever been to. They consistently do a phenomenal job which is hard to find in nail salons. It is always super clean in there and they are the nicest couple with the sweetest workers. So grateful Palm Nails came to the desert!<//Text>

I own a domain name I want to share with them soon. Along with a business Partnership they will be proud to represent them when deliverying their quality items to existing and potential new members. Did I mention the tax right off potential?? #matchmadeinheaven<//text>

<Review>I love Costco customer service.  I find everyone, when I go, very friendly. I am handicapped and can't tell you how I appreciate the electric carts and seats provided if you have to wait for one to become available. And best part is getting help to the car. If you have a lot of pain like I do, this kind of service makes you smile thru the pain. Thank you!!</Review>< userid>

<review>The self checkout is definitely worth keeping it below 25 items and no alcohol. But if you are in for the big shopping the regular line is your only option.
I tend to find more variety in the Costco in Charlotte NC but this one is pretty neat too.<//review><response>None< /response><pics>None<//pics><rate>5<//rate>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Love Costco but the Stanford Ranch store has a space challenge.

They are constantly changing the location of staple items that, at first, made me think they had just run out. Now I know that I just have to look harder to find them.

This is the first time I have encountered this in Costco’s network.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>This Costco is always clean and organized! There is always always a huge crowd but the lines move pretty fast. We used the self check out which had no line at all, quickest check out ever. The snack bar line was long but we only waited about 5 mins for our order, with the amount of people waiting I thought that was quick!< /review>< pictures>

<text>If I could give them zero stars I would. This is my third time being here, today I came here as  an Insta cart I received the same scrutiny I do when I come as a customer. No one else’s membership card picture will be checked but mine, and there a list of other atrocities and I have to blame the location. But all Black people are not thieves or fraudsters  just think the employees at Costco  and the rude person working cashier 6 should know</text><UserId.>112748328098698597545< /UserId.><pics>None</pics>< GmapID>

Great at answering the phone. They never have the fruit trees that I want such as citrus. Also, the peony plants are way too small. The food court is good. Some leggings here are over priced.<//text>

<text>A typical Costco.  This store was clean and well staffed.  They also have several self check-out stations, no alcohol, to help expedite checkout.  Convenient location, and ample parking.  Close to grocery store and Staples.  This Costco has a lot of extras you would expect in a busy location.  There is also a Costco gas station there.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGJeYWMMjgl0rXY0Wmi8PDW9DQaeCf15vabMVc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMkL4PqybmkknxnD8symkLhEaqqyJ1qyGr28fS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrQHMyzqwokuKvR6r5_zODDY-mVLTfiALFCyZb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNYxsn0QeGWPI_7K6s-BPblpSa24zx99iCUbWDG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfO95Q7lqlpzPZi47pH6cGnLYw78djeFr7h0o6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFv1mdOfWXV3lM3JlR4bcSuf5I62Ozp49SkSjs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8nen1r-H_er-EuSh44mkH6YCihMhHjtQi-Sgg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxFdvOGOi_4cvX9l7-hgUkibuHAZUo2C1meh1n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPUzmNVGTebLKwXMIfNyCVnfAY88PAjrs5NZ_mt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7a2GjQxugWahf5LMKu53B0tPlNJOMV32IcUQw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOE8d9E0JO1gGKkslOXfgfnSevLBoru8Y2l9SO7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNZOdoAh4isBA3puw3YGiDsbpNKmdMcYCI0wkhw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNDGk-0DF-nvGgzYo9KPBkuzN3YPMyWepcotRxg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMBB-haitnFXDqUgnllraOTxW8b4zabQ2vRbMWZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPndeXELNH4QmsonvgFXMWHf2FTni1VlMVOqJ5J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-L4f3umbjc_Tg_Rpnt2Q4WQ9DJVEVvOZdqss_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu65WVvctnAhD9YKYBGOo8JCnXpPupjAOAoeXi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOwH-gWLPm0y9_DmE1CTx149pgSfDzUlMNLMNAu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUyXF4qVE9nEImk1fdnv12OlKUpW48R3UzEPBB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMShRkkfyuFAK85OB72Ppa0NuZZK87Rl6MCey_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-28YfHmcZ9qEpE7Cd8ZjPvEWm0paqTZUWgmys=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhsHPSwUYmZ9PD3UReUdvyOh-kQ8dVKSqiGFMV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPB4DXfktQuTqWFcrcSfHWeOhqiPv9WlduwiaBV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGYrkywnmGr-l0Ih379x5ZsjFGUQlScRerRo1M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEcPcmtSCwsVP0ngd0uWau7hcEpZ1QnNQEIPII=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT3semjm9uUHkgBrxP4pWG9sOV4B0JYRRoiLTK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2vMT862ZN9Wt6J4k9Rd_xQ4O8sHJDw7OmNotr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPP-Ac_isaN50vsOh9KUfanIDduXUkImDqZYl2n=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPuYyC9TD5KsKrrvP3AVmRVEszgGbfTLDQZe6Ww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpZ4K1-D4NjleOt8Rt9onq7_nQM4BN1axc4BQf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMM2a2roft_KB8f4wYJHjikR35PRsQtwTPoqwYP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNlqwozY-YJt7N84kkrQU6Zz-IpAT3IFnpzgNls=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< response>

Today, Alex in the COSTCO Optometry Department assisted me with my contact lenses purchase for 2020. He verified my VSP insurance and provided me with the costs with or without insurance. We also discussed daily wear lenses verses 14 day lenses and their costs. Alex was courteous, very knowledgeable, kind and most important to me attentive. With all the distractions around us he never wavered. He gave me his utmost attention like I was the only customer in COSTCO. That's what I call excellent customer service. Thank you, Alex!</Text>

The cell phone department is an absolute disaster. I put a phone on hold and drove 45 minutes then waited for 45 more minutes for my turn, just to be told that there was an error and that phone is a special order for someone else. Afterwards I ordered the phone I wanted and was told it would be in within 2-3 business days. It's been 10+ days now and they tell me they aren't sure what happened with my order and to call Verizon. Go to the Verizon store or Best Buy if you want a quality customer experience, these guys have zero clue what they are doing.<//Text>

<name>Raz Kaur<//name><Text>I come to Costco all the time for groceries. They always have everything I need. I love the selection of groceries and supplies they have stocked. Employees are always so nice and helpful. I just came to Costco and had the worst customer service experience from cashier Chuck W. usually I don’t have to put everything on the checkout stand and only the small things and he tells my rudely to put everything on there next time.... He also told me husband to “Make sure he always takes everything out of the cart next time.” I understand if it is busy but it was not busy and he had 1 other customer besides us. He didn’t say a single word to us after that. Did not give me the total when he was done scanning, he just stood there looking at me, while I was waiting for a total amount. He also didn’t give us a box to put all our items in. So now I have to carry everything one by one??
Didn’t appreciate his customer service, he seemed to busy to be interacting with his other coworkers rather than paying attention to his customers and greeting them nicely.<//Text></record>

Went to Costco to get a couple of Christmas gifts and there was two people without a mask.  Told Costco employee about the situation. Costco employee went up to the customer ask one time to put the mask on and the person took it off again so they kicked them out.

<review>I called this Costco before they even opened, and spoke to lady and she told me they had a product I was looking for. I asked her if she could set it aside for me since I was driving from 2 hours away. She told me that she couldn’t do that because it was first come first serve. However, when I get to this Costco and speak to customer service person in person, they tell me she lied and that if I spoke to a manager, a manager would have definitely set it aside. So in the end, I didn’t get my product, drove 2 hours just to find out that my item COULD have been set aside. So if you call this Costco and want an item set aside SPEAK TO A MANAGER INSTEAD, because they will straight lie to you!!!<//review>< response>

Generally a well-stocked shopping experience with polite customers and employees.

Ample parking. Conveniently located next to Sprouts and Home Depot for other odds and ends that don't need to be pallet sized. 😉

For the Pandemic Shopping Crowd - cart wipe table ready to go upon entry as well as a billboard with a list of items that are not currently available.

Store has been rearranged in the last few months since last visit, however the new layout seems to facilitate social distancing to the best of this location's abilities for the cold produce, egg, and dairy items.

Of the two Costco locations equidistant from our house on trips that are specifically "Costco" oriented, our family likes this one the best.<//Text>

Thankfully there wasn’t too much of a crowd! Overall the store was clean and well organized  with what appeared to be plenty of friendly and motivated staff to keep the stock from looking like wild dogs picked it over in a frenzy! Worth the trip today!<//Text>

This Costco is super busy. Parking is a pain.  However, the customer service here is great and the facility is clean. It has a gas pump area that is usually busy, but the lines for them usually move along swiftly.</review>

It's always too crowded. Hard to find parking space. Good thing is they finally put in some self checkout stands. That helps move the lines a little faster. I only go there now when I absolutely have to. Prefer Sam's Club for most things. Much easier to get in and out.</text>

This is a very odd location, they have a very disorganized layout here. Perhaps the engineers were drunk or something lol. Plus We heard people complaining about traffic and over crowded LOL they have not seen the bay and SoCal yet 😆.

Anyway its costco, they have most stuff compared to the ones in the bay, but their merchandise in terms of quality and diversity is greatly lacking.

Plus it felt that this location is small, or perhaps the way they laid out things is very bad since it takes so much of the space especially when people don't follow social distancing at all, great job on that.

The workers compared to the bay are okay and not very attentive lol or perhaps if ur non white they care about u wearing a mask and if ur white they give you a free pass for not having a mask lol.

Lastly, they had a sign from the entrance  that they were out of certain items including disinfectant wipes when we found one, evidently someone didn't know what type of products they provide LOL<//Text>

This is the most difficult Costco I've been to. The parking lot is tight, parking is scarce, and it was packed! Huge line for the rotisserie chicken! They get you in and out quickly though, so that's always a plus!</Text>

My wife has a Costco card, and I don't.  I had to get gas, so my wife used her card and then entered earlier while I pumped the gas,
. 5 min later I came to the entrance.  I've had this situation before and told the employee the same thing I always do, that my wife had entered before me and she had the card. The guy refused to let me in.  Pretty lame....what can I do without a card anyway?  We were going to look at buying a bunch of plants for the garden, but we'll go somewhere else.

Parking is also terrible and this lot has the worst congestion anywhere in Roseville.</review>

One of the worst Costcos out there. We thought coming here at 1030 would avoid the crowd.

I cringe everytime I go to this costco because it's always super crowded and it really seems back to normal except with face masks.

Be prepared to be in mosh pit mode near the meat, dairy and especially food court area no one cares for the 6 ft distance. The food court is super unorganized no markings, long lines, two associates running. Customer Service is a joke.

Pros: no lines on checkout and always well stocked.< /Text>

< review>
This is a nice, clean Costco, employees are always friendly, and I like the way it's organized inside. I love the wine, meat and produce selections and prices are the best. However this is a very busy Costco, parking is hard to find and its a very tight parking lot. Return line, checkout lines, and food market lines are almost always long. I've found the best time to go is an hour before close.< /review>

Getting gas/line was quick to little wait, getting out of there was horrible. Layout to exit back onto a main thoroughfare was a nightmare.< /Text>

This was a new experience as we weren't familiar with the Roseville, CA COSTCO. Well stocked both in goods and patrons! Although we benefited from the sales and browsing quite a lot, the best part was how QUICKLY we were able to check out! If you are a Senior, you know how much that is appreciated! Standing still for long periods of time  is often a painful process.
If there were more strategically placed resting spots in the store where people could sit for awhile between their shopping excursions there would be a 5th star on my review.</review>

<Review>I went to Costco 2 days before Christmas to buy King crab legs for our holiday dinner. I arrived when they opened, but so did everyone else. I ended up being about 10th in the fresh fish line. The store was packed, but hey it's Costco!

All in all in the crab line moved very quickly. The Costco employee was very helpful with questions about my seafood purchases. Also made suggestions for better price combinations.

At the checkout the lines where crazy long, but honestly it only took about 5 minutes to get checked out. I'll share my secret checkout tip with you. Use the last line by the pharmacy for quicker checkout at the Roseville store.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Roseville Costco is a TERRIBLE place to go during this covid pandemic.  It is very CROWDED, and many of the customers AND employees do not take the simple measures of 1) wearing a mask properly and 2) maintaining a social distance of 6 feet.  I recommend NOT going there unless you enjoy shopping in a crowded store with a lot of rude people.< /review>< rating>

<Text>The hearing aids I bought here at the Roseville store in 2017 did not seem to be working well for me. I contacted the store and made an appointment with the hearing specialist, Linda Oldham-Douglas. Linda spent a serious amount of time checking the devices over, installing new updates to enhance their features, retested my hearing and made some adjustments and related work and wham.....all better!

I had the weirdest experience at this store today.
Some of the service was great. Gilbert and Chris were super helpful with helping me get a tv along with another associate who I can't remember the name of. They were helpful and polite.

But I was wearing a backless off the shoulder sweater shirt, and a blonde sales clerk woman came up to me and adjusted my shirt saying it was falling off ( it's an off the should sweater shirt, the point is that it be off my shoulder). It was the most uncomfortable experience. Her reasoning was that a man may try to snap the back of my bra. I know she was trying to be helpful, but she definitely wasn't six feet away. We are in a pandemic, but even if we weren't having my shirt adjusted without her asking or me asking was creepy. I was with my mom who would have adjusted my off the shoulder sweater if I actually needed it. Touching my shirt is not her job.</text>

We have looked at the day and times when our local Costco outlet has the  lowest crowds and we then truly get the best use of our dollars at the safest times.  We are retired but Costco  helps us  truly stretch our income dollars.  Thank you Costco<//text>

I arrived when they opened, but so did everyone else. I ended up being about 10th in the fresh fish line. The store was packed, but hey it's Costco!

All in all in the crab line moved very quickly. The Costco employee was very helpful with questions about my seafood purchases. Also made suggestions for better price combinations.

At the checkout the lines where crazy long, but honestly it only took about 5 minutes to get checked out. I'll share my secret checkout tip with you. Use the last line by the pharmacy for quicker checkout at the Roseville store.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809b1ff000000001:0x6040260c93ea3659< /Gmap_id></record>

We love this Costco. It’s often very busy. But very well kept and managed. Make sure to get the app to check the sales for that month! Overtime it’s a great to save even more money by shopping there as household items will go on sale right about the time you need more of whatever it is.</Review>

Staff are very helpful and good humored.  The store seemed to be well stocked with just a few exceptions.   Almost everyone had a mask on BUT it was obvious that some don't understand that having a mask under the nose and in some cases under both nose and mouth does not provide protection.  I understand that people with breathing problems are exempt.  The rest of us need to do our very best to protect each other.< /review>

<username>Richnjca Rich</username><Rate>2</Rate><review>Costco Roseville only gets 2 stars today, Fri 7/10, for letting some shoppers and even a few employees walk around and not properly wearing masks.

I saw shoppers and employees seen with their nose not under the masks. This is improper usage.

I saw a few shoppers just "wearing" their masks just hanging on their chin or around their necks. I asked one such couple to "please put their masks on properly." Response from the husband was for me to f..... myself.

I suggest Costco management to walk the aisles every once in a while and ask folks to apply masks properly or leave the store.  Just posting a small sign at entrance is not enough.< /review>< date>

I always like Costco, but I can't stand the location -- people drive around the parking lot like idiots and they're incredibly rude. Those same people inside the store act pushy and rude. Folks in Roseville need relax!< /Review>

< review>
We've been going here since moving to Auburn from the peninsula (Bay Area)  and it's NOT crowded like Colma or Foster City....I'm sure it can busy but so far it hasn't been since we started shopping here. The employees are so much friendlier than what we've experienced, elsewhere and once we get in line we may wait 10 minutes and we're out the door. Shhh don't tell anyone...let's keep THIS OUR secret!<//review>

<text>The Costco staff here are very quick and they're not afraid to open more lines if there are a lot of customers checking out. Other Costco locations just seem to be overhauled with so many people checking out and the many times I've been here, I've almost never had to wait in a long line.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPW_0a-q60cmBrXM9PcHnjP0F9bhVdFaP8mOocF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTr1giXixFVoVwP4tZyRqCeULM7aJSVA1z9LU2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxa36E0z0jTXgIr0N91YkE6ALt7dWxWyUpf0Ho=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNKIWkkFAOLWXAOMxvqNY3eZKa2BJ9xYoZGrMZL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< resp>

I shop here reluctantly, to justify my membership... Always busy, tasting stands and people who don't pay attention to others (which is a lot) block circulation and turn the whole thing into a teeth-grinding experience.. Traffic getting here is poor, turn lanes take multiple lights to get through.
Would have been nice to get different hours during covid... not everyone can make it during the regular working hours or wants to be in long line on weekends...< /review>

<text>It's Costco. Much like every other Costco. However, Costco is synonymous with quality, bulk pricing, and oversized quantities. This is a pretty standard Costco all things considered, but probably the nicest in the northern greater Sacramento area.</text><Name>Ian Byerrum</Name><Rate>5</Rate>< pictures>

Friendly staff and the move the lines quickly. Store is easy to get around in and we always find what we need and then some. I like the organic meat selections and the fruit. Parking is always really difficult. We recently got new tires and the guys there were amazing and the appointment setup worked great, in and out on time.</text>

I went with a friend who is a member. When I pulled into the parking lot I was overwhelmed with all the cars. To my surprise, the store was busy but comfortable. The check out was quick and the snack bar was not only quick but exceptionally tasty. They pay their employees well and it shows with their attitudes and eagerness to give great service. Well done Costco. Now, any chance of you hiring? Fingers crossed. 🤗</Text>

<text>Costco offers many different items at great prices. They have a great return policy as well. Their return policy is pretty much unmatched by any other store. My issue with this particular location is that it is too busy. If Costco built another location across the street, they both would still be packed - guaranteed.<//text>< pics>

<Text>Love Costco, but this is the busiest one I've ever seen.  We go here weekly and the parking and traffic is consistently insane (reason for only 4 stars).  It doesn't matter what day of the week, you can hardly get in/out of this place.  PLEASE BUILD ANOTHER COSTCO to take the traffic off this store.< /Text>< Resp>

<text>Love what I find here. They have added self-checkout lines so I am very happy with Costco these days. I can get in and out very quickly. And the included warranties on some items are very, very hard to beat. For instance one of my relatives recently purchased a desktop computer from Costco. It came with a 2 year warranty at no extra charge and they bought it with their Costco Citibank card, so that gave it a 4 year warranty at no extra charge. Costco has a commitment to excellent products and service.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x809b1ff000000001:0x6040260c93ea3659<//gmap_id></record>

Who doesn’t love Costco? I come here for my groceries and a few other items. I have used Costco’s tire, pharmacy, and optical services and it’s been quite inconsistent. It’s like anything, when Costco tries to dip into too many things, the quality can get sacrificed.

The pharmacy can be convenient depending on the time of day you come. I feel every pharmacy is the same when it comes to the service they provide. I just don’t like the lines at Costco.

The optical is not worth my time waiting and the quality doesn’t meet my needs. I have amazing glasses from specialty optical shops and they’re phenomenal in terms of how clear and crisp everything is. For some reason glasses at Costco never does well for me.

I’ve used the tire services at Costco before elsewhere (not here). The tire department is okay, friendly guys, but I prefer to go to a shop where that’s their speciality so I can have a quality experienced mechanic work on my vehicles.

Overall I love Costco for my shopping needs.< /Text>

Costco has the best hot dog deal & tasty pizza & chicken salad at the food court!!! I joke around calling Costco, the $100 club, because you would be hard pressed to spend less, & usually find more to buy! The selection is always great & it is exciting to discover the new items as well as revisiting the old items to buy!!! Costco sells most of what you use & a lot more that you don't need!!! I like to fuel up at the unbeatable prices at the gasoline pumps too!!!<//Text>

It may be a busy location but the customer service is always top notch and they always busy the lines out. The store is well stocked and always has new seasonal merchandise that is up with the latest fun trends. Other than the busy parking lot, I really can't complain!</Review>

Was very clean, organized and well stocked. Cashiers and attendants were all wearing masks. Majority of them were even wearing them properly hahaha. While they are a pain in the butt their team was doing their best to stay safe and keep the guests safe. Although I wished someone was still wiping carts down before they were docked. Great job on your covid practices!<//Review>

If only I could rate this store a zero star!  Terrible attitudes from every single associate I came in contact with.  Someone needs to explain to their team members that the new social distancing rules we created by thier management not the customers.  No help at all from their rude team members.  Ill be canceling my membership.  Hello Sam's Club, here I come!</Text>

Tried to use a $37 cash voucher that was issued to my father.  He passed 4 weeks ago.  I was asked by one of the store supervisors that i needed a death certificate to show proof that he died.  $37 is chump change!  You insensitive morons!  This store has been going downhill for a while.  This experience is about as low as it gets.</review>

This place checks all the boxes. The staff is accommodating, the prices are great, and the quality is high. I’m not going to deduct a star for it being too busy; that only goes to prove my previous points.</Review>

At least once a month our family makes sure to visit Costco stocking up on food you just can't get at normal grocery stores. They have seaweed, yakult, and so many more family favorites. Walking around this massive store and trying out samples is one of our families favorite activities. Then after we finish checking out we always make sure to grab a box of the biggest pizza around.< /review>

<Review>Very nice, arrived to find a long line of people, a man with a loud speaker saying "only 350" people in the store at one time. With in 10 min we were in the store remained in line via staff shuttled to paper products and recieved toilet paper and paper towels. Stayed in line and paid for purchase and left.

Great service and cheapest gas in town. Busy lines but they are efficient and move faster than it looks like. Food court is accommodating and call ahead for pizzas and its a great deal. Plus its Costco so cant really go wrong...< /review>

Costco's great. Always good deals and bulk items.
However, I wish the mass amount of people there had better shopping etiquette.</text>

<Text>Auburn location used to be my favorite but think I'm switching it to this Roseville location simply because of the amount of Gas pumps they have. It's almost doubled compared to most Costco Gas stops. Also, the store is always clean and tidy. Shipping carts are also generally kept under control and not left around everywhere. Parking lot is small tho compared to most Costco's!</Text>< UserId.>

Not much to say except most items are discounted. Busy store but can always find parking. Cashiers lined move quickly. Added more gas pumps.<//Text>

< Review>
I always enjoy browsing Costco. You always end up buying too much and spending way too much money, but that's one place I don't mind. It's nice to go there every month to see what new stuff they have. Keep in mind that this place needs a membership to be a part of. They have excellent customer service and their return policy on stuff is great as long as you do not misuse it.< /Review>

<review>Great store, great location but the parking lot and especially inside can get crazy with people running into you and almost mowing you down trying to cross the street.

If it can be helped, I highly recommend getting an early start before it picks up to minimize the hazardous injury risk. Plus the fuel station lines won't be as ridiculous either.</review>< Pictures>

I ended up making a much larger purchase than I'd expected. All of the employees were very helpful in facilitating how I could get my items to my car; from the aisles, to the register, to the door, to the car, everyone was incredibly helpful! Very impressive, Costco!< /Text>

<review>Love Costco but I miss the Costco in Santa Clara.  They layout of the store is much better. Roseville is not laid out in cohesive way. I feel like I’m constantly backtracking. Also, I’ve been to Roseville Costco 5 times and it is always crowded—and by crowded I’m mean packed to the gills. I’m hoping they open one closer to me say in Auburn—-hint hint Costco!<//review>< Pictures>

Getting into this place is confusing due to people trying to get out and not yielding to everyone coming in who have the right of way.  This Costco is effected by a lot of people who are not considerate of others, but to be fair, our state has a lot of people who don't truly care about others.  I will say that the cashier was really nice.</Text>

Lots of stuff.   Very crowded.   Prices vary.  Not many great deals but compared to regular grocery stores buying in bulk does save money in the long run.   I found a pair of blue jeans for 11.99.</review>

<text>Love Costco just wish they had an Express lane a lot of us just run in for a couple of things and have to stand in line behind mountains of baskets. Can't tell you how many times I've gotten in line only to put my items back and leave. Waste of my time and your loss of a sale. Come on Costco you only need one Express lane of 6 items or less. Time to make your customers the priority. The additional sales you'll make from people using that Express lane will more than pay for the cashier. Promote it you'll be thanked by your loyal customers< /text><username>Sandra Garcia< /username><gmapID>0x809b1ff000000001:0x6040260c93ea3659</gmapID>< resp>

<Review>The prices are excellent! They have great deals. I don't have a membership because I take my mom with me when I go. That way we can spend time together plus I save money. I didn't give it 5 stars because the parking really stinks. People ate n a hurry to get no where. Plus there isn't enough handicap spots.< /Review>< resp>

I was going to tell the cashier guy,"wow, you guys really move people through the line," but he was concentratin' and I didn't want to mess up his stuff. Lots of different things every time we go and all the employees are friendly. That's the way to run a store.<//Review>

<Review>Has just about everything a standard Costco has, but no real garden department like some do, but it does have a gas station.  Folks are friendly and, so long as you time your trip not to coincide with busiest times, you can actually get through a line in a decent amount of time.  Highly recommend Costco travel for nearly all your travel needs. We've done comparison pricing and it has always had the best deals we could find.  I also signed up for my Quickbooks Online account through them and our auto insurance. Best deals I could find for both were through Costco.

The crowds here are pretty intense and the traffic situation is getting even more challenging. The gas station has only added to the problem, but the prices are good. Can't wait to see how the crowds  are reduced by the planned new Costco in Loomis.</Review>< Pics>

Although Costco is an all around good place to shop and the gas is the best, The parking lot lanes at this Roseville location are too narrow and the congestion of traffic is dangerous, frightening and frustrating. People are impatient and discourteous, therefore making the parking lot a perfect place for a car accident. I will take all Avenues to avoid shopping at this Costco.</Text>

Looked everywhere for new prescription glasses. Costco was the Best
$226 = frames,no line bifocals, transtishion to sun glasses.  Other places started at $300 and up.
I love my brew glasses.
Thank you Costco</text>

<text>THIS LOCATION HAS THE MOST RUDE, UNFRIENDLY, & UNPROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES I HAVE EVER SEEN..

NOT ONLY ARE WE GOING THRU A DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE COVD19, BUT SHOW A LITTLE COMPASSION OR EMPATHY TO THE PPL IN THE STORE.. JUST ALL BAD VIBES.  EMPLOYEE ACT LIKE THEY OWN THE STORE.

AND TO THE CLICKISH PPL, "KICK ROCKS, STICK THEM RIGHT UP IN YOUR EARS!" SERIOUSLY!

I WILL NEVER SHOP AT THIS COSTCO AGAIN, VERY UPPITY & NOT OK TYPE OF ENVIRONMENT/LOCATION.</text>< Pictures>

Great store to purchase the weekly groceries for the family. Lots of products, but a few of them cycle in and out if they're less popular. All products (including clothes) come in larger sizes. Frequent sales. Beyond food, they offer electronics (computers, cameras, phones), clothes, books, furniture, medications, and whey protein.
Love grabbing some samples while I'm shopping. Food court is fantastic, especially for the hot dogs. Great value.<//review>

Extremely busy location. Good luck on finding parking during rush hours but at least the gas station was recently expanded to add a few more pumps. They also have a great array of plants and flowers at the entrance and their food court is akwardly located in front of the checkout line, it would be a good spot if their were more for circulation and space for standing in line as the food court can get pretty packed. Also the gas station here is open till 9:30pm on weekdays and 8:00pm on weekends.< /Text>

<text>I like going here but you only get 8 things than its 100 dollars. So I go to get certain things. I wish they would give more sales. But it's nice that we get to try out the foods (the samples).<//text><GmapID>0x809b1ff000000001:0x6040260c93ea3659</GmapID>< UserId.>

I was really disappointed by the staff. While I was asking about item that I am looking for she turned around from me and started talking to employee about the schedule. She didn’t apologies nor she answered on my question. Very rude! Usually Costco have 5 star for service and staff but for today it 0. I wasn’t expecting to experience this kind of rudeness.
Will prepare myself for next time.< /text>

Great prices on just about everything you could think to possibly buy from groceries to mattresses to washing machines. But whatever you do, don't forget to pick up a rotisserie chicken while there. They inject them with some kind of crack liquid that makes them juicy and delicious... and somehow they sell them for $5 bucks.<//Text>

Love it but it's not big enough for the amount of people that use it! It's almost always packed in the store, in the parking lot, and at the gas pumps. They're usually good about keeping regular items stocked but anything that's a special will be gone very fast! Unfortunately the produce always goes bad very quickly. Everything else is great. The staff is always nice. The food court is always good too. I love that they've added vegan options but do miss the chocolate ice cream.<//Text>< pictures>

A very populated and impacted area, warehouse is clean and well stocked.  Thankfully lots of parking, but you will generally walk a ways to the entrance.  Costco is always fun to walk through and  if you are like me I don't care for crowds, so when I go it is all new merchandise and eye candy.</Review>

<review>OMG! I went to Costco this morning, SENIOR'S  morning,  I got there early and I wasn't the first in line, ha,ha,ha😁.  But once the 500 plus people started moving it was really great.  The  employees have their stuff together.  Treating us very nice, they, the employees, were available to answer any questions and assist in lifting the heavy things, ie: TP & PT. Wow, I was so impressed and greatfull.  Happy member👏👏👏</review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Very busy but great value as usual. I've heard this location is one of the busiest in the country. The pork loin price per lb has been reduced so a whole loin was less than $11. Great price for succulents also.< /Text>

I shop at the Citrus Heights store I went there last night the people there were amazing as I wanted to purchase a laptop.  Today I went to the  Roseville store because of the sales tax I must say your Roseville store has no one working in computers I flagged down a lady she was very rude to me I went to the front desk to ask for help he called I am assuming the same lady she said she was too busy and send someone over, someone came over and he seemed irritated he had the help me as the computer was unplugged needless to say I bought the  Computer but if I had to do it over again I would have paid the extra sales tax for the Citrus Heights store they are courteous and totally are the ones that sold me on this laptop your Roseville store I'm very dismayed with there level of customer service.</Review>

Am so disappointed they chose to no longer carry their signature combination pizza at the food court. They are still making pepperoni and cheese pizzas though. Cheese is always my fav do hope they bring back combination once pandemic ends.<//text>

<name>Shehab Almuslehi</name><Text>Unlike previous visits, cashier#5 on 09/27/19 gave everyone on his line a hard time, wasting customers time at peak hours with side talk to his co-worker, he was not even looking at the items and start scanning the next customer items when I told him those are not mine, he said YOU SHOULD TOLD ME!!!
not sure why we have the blue bars on his belt, mainly to separate items, but he was totally not focusing,
I believe the management should look at their avarage speed compare to others< /Text>< Rating>

Really good pricing, tasty and inexpensive food in the food court area.
They are usually well stocked and clean.
This Costco is definitely superior to the Citrus Heights Costco.
My only complaint actually has nothing to do with the store: the parking lot is a nightmare. It always feels like taking your life in your own hands when you go here.< /Review>

I find majority of what I need here. What I don’t like is how much money I spend even though I have less than 10 items, but that’s not Costco’s fault. Buying in bulk tends to do that to our wallets. Some workers are nice, some are not useful. They keep their store organized and I like going to the food court here when I need something quick to eat. I recommend coming here if you need things in bulk. If it’s a few items, I say support your local markets. You’ll end up buying more than you’ll ever need and wasting a good amount of the food.< /Text>

<Text>What I can say about Costco, I love this place. I find great prices all the time, I love to get my son's diapers, wipes here, also we get toilet paper is also super cheap, and of course lots more of home cleaning supplies, but they got food too, like huge bags of tortilla chips, potato chips, cereal, cookies and candy, even clothing and electronics. They have the most beautiful displays ever, this time of the year they have a few Christmas trees up already.... we got ours from there couple years ago and still in great shape and lights still work fine
But what I most like about Costco besides the prices is PIZZA!!! YUM YUM</Text>< Pics>

Store is so overcrowded you can’t maneuver a shopping cart in it, not to mention if a fire or some kind of emergency situation occurs seems as if it would be impossible for most to get out safely.  And that’s not even addressing the same issue in the parking lot & the way traffic is supposed to get in & out of it.  I pray someone looks into this before something happens.< /text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I love how they are constantly rotating out items. You never know what you might find, particularly in the electronic and gadget area. I have also come across some neat books and even some tools. My wife and I only make it there about once a month, but we stock up when we do. It is well worth the yearly membership fee. I had always heard of Costco being a "you have to buy 50 at a time in bulk" type of wholesale place. However in my experience, most items are in a reasonable quantity.<//text>< date>

Costco is required to allow people in for the food court, alcohol, cigarettes, pharmacy, or optical workout a card.

<review>From the entrance inside this store, there's a whole variety of things that are on special promotion or sale. Also, this particular location sells biggest variety of organic products. I always find this store clean, employees are very friendly, and they are great at answering questions regarding products. This place is so worth to have a membership at!!!!<//review>< Gmap_id>

I don't go often because it's a zoo. Parking is hard to find and the shopping center itself is just difficult. I know they don't like it either.
Flowers are always the best around and great prices on alcohol!< /Review>

Who doesn't love Costco?  Happy, helpful employees. Great selection of good quality merchandise at competitive prices.  Costco membership also brings some of the best travel benefits as well.  If your not a member, you should be.<//Review>

Your gas prices are about 25. To 35 cent more a gallen More than the Costco on expo. I don't really understand i would think Costco's should match prices we qent out of are way to fill up are second car after finding gass for under three dollars. Just to find yor gass to be 3.15 not cool 12/13/19<//review>

This is a great Costco. Been shopping here since 2008. I see majority of the same people working there since I first starting shopping there. It's a very busy Costco compared to most so be ready to play bumper carts with people. My family and I go in there usually an hour before closing on the weekdays and it's not so busy making for a pleasant shopping experience.</Text>

Found excellent prices! However the person helping the cashier was RUDE! There was this Asian gentleman in front of me and he putting toilet paper and paper towels on the belt and a couple item and this helper dude snatched them from the belt and had this pathetic smug in his face like the Customer committed a great sin! And the guy keep this irritated look on his face. I wondered if it was his I'm so focused look but when he spoke to the cashier...it DISAPPEARED! So for some reason HIS ATTITUDE WAS TOWARDS THE ASIAN GENTLEMAN. I could see the the customer was uncomfortable! Helper dude could have explained to the CUSTOMER, Id like to put back in the cart your items so the cashier can quickly scan and you dont have to lift these items. Can I do that for you SIR.< /Text>

<text>Typical Costco layout. The meat section is fantastic. Always fresh and top quality. The Kirkland brand toilet paper, paper towels, hot dogs and dog food are the best. As usual, there are items worth buying in bulk and lots of items you'd be better off buying smaller quantities of at a normal store.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< rate>

Costco fuel stations are always busy, but for good reason; the fuel is a great value.

Most Costco stations don’t offer diesel, which is a real pity because diesel is what business runs on. This station DOES offer diesel, which is why I was there.

The diesel seems to be of good quality, without the moisture soaking B-20 biodiesel mix that many stations sometimes have. Use of B-20 can void new diesel warranty, so you are good here.</text>

This is always a good Costco, but always very busy. Expect to drive around for a bit to find a parking spot. But it is clean and generally well run and you can't really go wrong with Costco<//review>

They usually always have sample at 1 pm. If you miss it there is always the snack bar. The price for a quarter pound beef hot dog and soda are only a $1.50.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Definitely the warehouse/store to go for excellent prices, quality, availability and cleaniness. Warehouse hours are conducive for a working person.
The store associates are easily accessible and knowledgeable on the versatility of warehouse products.
The "Treasure Hunts " are ALWAYS fruitful and exciting. ( I have had the pleasure of some great finds) and saved some big $$$$.
Thank you, Costco for your offerings.</text>< Pictures>

Who doesn't love Costco. Super friendly and helpful staff, many who have been there for years. This is busy location though, parking can be tough. Best time to go is usually later in the early evening an hour or so before closing.</text>

Costco fuel stations are always busy, but for good reason; the fuel is a great value.

Most Costco stations don’t offer diesel, which is a real pity because diesel is what business runs on. This station DOES offer diesel, which is why I was there.

The diesel seems to be of good quality, without the moisture soaking B-20 biodiesel mix that many stations sometimes have. Use of B-20 can void new diesel warranty, so you are good here.< /review>

It's still worth the money for the membership. This location is popular, probably because the selection of staples stays mostly unchanged. Best parking is at the back of the store.< /Text>

<Text>For our first time ever, I have something negative to report about Costco. We just purchased a 10 pound brisket. It turned out to be about 8 pounds of jiggly fat. The small amount of actual beef is heavily marbled, too. We've never encountered this. It's going back this morning.</Text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Everything. You can buy anything here. The store is massive! It has its own membership program, an eye care section, a deli, and more..!</Review>

I usually come in with my mindset on one thing but I come out with many more. I belong to a big family and group of friends where the quantity plays a big role. I say my needs and wants are usually met nearly everytime I visit. At this particular Costco the team members there are very helpful.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x809b1ff000000001:0x6040260c93ea3659</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Love this store and the employees, especially at the customer return desk.  Deborah is fantastic. Sam at the optical department is very friendly and very helpful. Even though we have downsized, we still go shopping there twice a week and fill up with gas weekly. Eating area is very limited.</text>

I really like shopping here because there are so many items available at Costco Wholesale at an excellent price.
Their buyers choose the best of each category and they negotiate great costs with their suppliers. They are also conscious of the environment and of delivering quality.
I trust the people and the products of Costco!<//Text>

Crowded, rude, impossible to find parking. Perfect if you're from Manhattan. Employees are rude, can't be bothered, and could care less about customer service. I'd recommend the Folsom or Citrus Heights stores...much better.< /text>

This used to be a 5 star store but it's way too crowded now to be an enjoyable experience.  The parking lot is a mess and forget about trying to make it to the gas pumps.  I suggest the weeknights as the lines are a little shorter and you can avoid the tangled mess of shopping carts clogging the isles waiting for free samples.<//review>

They used to be really really good lately all the fruits and vegetables have spoiled within two days of getting them home that's not a good thing because they're not supposed to do that but their customer service is amazing they take back everything if it's green and it's not supposed to be they took it back with no problem and no questions asked but I live 45 miles away from it so it's not something usually returned quickly. Parking is usually a little bit on the Rough Side as I'm handicapped and the handicap spaces are always full there's maybe eight of them right up front and then down a little ways there's probably about 8 more but there's never space to park even in the regular parking spaces lot of the times there isn't anything up close to drive around and around but that's Costco I got a huge parking lot and it's almost always pretty full</Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>It's Costco what's not to love. The Roseville store is one of the busiest in the country according to an employee I spoke with and the parking lot is a bit of a nightmare. Gas prices are the best around but you must be a member. The Costco Visa Card has outstanding benefits that make the store an even better value. If you make green drinks hit the produce section. Try shopping after 7 p.m. for smaller crowds.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x809b1ff000000001:0x6040260c93ea3659<//Gmap_id></record>

Costco is the bomb dot com. I got a ton of crystalized ginger from here and the quality was fantastic. There are about a hundred other bulk options for your stuff face needs. The best thing of all? They treat their customers well, and the customer service displays that without saying.< /review>

A place where you can buy a lot of different things but not as per your requirement, but instead on a discovery basis.

Not much variety of products available but you can buy basic stuff in bulk.

Lastly, I recommend going to Bargain outlet stores or Walmart if you are looking to are not looking to buy in bulk.

P.S. The pizza is below average.</text>

< Review>
Costco, a place to shop. Suggestions: 1). add self scanning system to speed up the the process. 2). Introduce a modern electronic system to find your items (RFID). This will require many computers inside the store for customers, shelves being better identified where those items are located. I expect Costco to be a 21st century store! The faster the customer shops, the happier will be. It's too much time wasted finding things and paying for them!< /Review>

First, let me tell you I love Costco and go to this one at least two times a week.  It is super convenient for me so I can stop in for just a couple items.

I've been to every Costco in the greater Sacramento area and rate this one as third.  Number one is Woodland and number two is Citrus Heights.  Seems strange as Rocklin a as a city is way nicer than either of those places.

Staff here is always helpful and professional.  Even when the lines are long they move pretty quick.< /review>

<Text>I love shopping here,  but the parking lot is just too darned small! The folks in the Optical Department are wonderful - very professional too. And you can't beat Costco for the price on eyeglasses. They were $100 less than Sam's Club.

Very very busy. Surprisingly clean for how busy it was. The staff was also much more friendly and helpful than I expected with all the chaos.<//Review>

I think the best time to go is during the week, and not on the weekends. Because during the week everybody is at work, so it isn't as busy as it would be on the weekends.
It's a good place to buy stuff. At good prices.</text>

Costco is forever crowded but this one has a good staff. They're usually pretty well stocked on merchandise and even though it was busy I only had to wait 20 minutes for a whole pizza (it's an easy $10 dinner).<//Text>

For the past 10 years I've been going to Costco and picking up Northern triple-ply bathroom tissue and all of a sudden now they don't carry it and they're saying because it's not a coupon item at this moment. Which is ridiculous it's been there for 10 years and it's not by coincidence that I only went during the time that they actually have those promotions for 10 years!! Really??<//Text>

Staff is efficiently quick, sample ladies are nice, it's Clean, organized, and always seems to be stocked. I reduced 1 star because this is definitely NOT the place to go if in a rush. The lines for parking and for the registers is a guaranteed wait. (Even if most of the registers are open.)</text>

<Text>I walked in through the exit door and had my card in hand to go to the foodcourt and I'm fairly certain one of the male teenager receipt checkers sarcasticly said, "Thank you for walking through the exit door, you don't need your card".

Same great prices, same long lines, customers stuffing their faces with samples, enough fresh steaks and toilet paper to feed and wipe all the asses of a small country, customers giving each other dirty looks and banging carts into each others' cars without remorse or admitting fault.

Great staff but this is the smallest Costco in the area. They are always out of items or just don't stock items like other stores. Bulk items like milk they constantly run out of resulting in long waits for the forklift driver. They should build a larger one in Rocklin. Recommend Costco at citrus heights as a better alternate.</Text>

Cosco just cannot have less than 5 stars considering their amazing prices and the amount of products in stock, as well as the fact that the lines take around 10 minutes on weekends when it's pretty busy. Great place where you can have a whole lunch by just trying out the samples all around the store))<//Review>

Always super crowded and never enough buggy returns. Other states we have lived in never had this buggy return issue.< /Review>

<text>First, I don't work for Sam's Club. But holy cow Costco is crazy busy. And good luck getting "in and out" quickly. Compared to Sam's Club, Costco does seem to be better quality on some items, especially specialty and seasonal things. However, for just regular grocery items, I much prefer to go to Sam's Club. I found Costco to be priced higher on just about everything we normally purchase at Sam's - toiletries, milk, eggs, cereal, etc.. Also, Sam's Club has the Scan and Go app. I can scan items as I load them into my cart, pay on my phone and show my electronic receipt at the door. No waiting in the unmanageable and cramped lines like at Costco. Gas prices are the same between the two, but much less crowded at Sam's Club.</text>< pics>

Parking is a hassle. Prefer Folsom location because parking is easier and they have greater variety than Roseville. Also, Roseville doesn't like to mark their items down.<//text>

<rate>4< /rate><text>Costco without a doubt keeps getting better, i love that they continue to offer more organic plant based options, they truly are uncomparable. I make a 40 minute drive to the roseville location. I can only hope they one day put one in Yuba city. I gave this location only a 4 star because i have had bad experiences in the past with some employees and have reported them shortly after leaving but it does get uncomfortable because you dont know who will be rude or having a bad day the next time you go. Iv been to many Costco's but have never had a bad experience except in this one. I absolutely love costco and go to this location because it is the closest to me but i do hope thier employees learn a little more about customer service or have meetings about this subject would be greatly appreciated.<//text>< Pics>

A record for my trips there.  Usually, I see a line and can't stand that long so I have to give up and leave.  Yeah, not today.  I got home feeling good and then proceeded to fall from the back of the truck while getting the groceries.  I didn't hit my head, no.  I hit my bum, right wrist and elbow and lower back.  Anyway, my venturing out doesn't happen often.  Now, u may see why.<//text></record></dataset><record>

This location is busy most of the time that I am able to go so I usually go to the Citrus Heights location. It also seems a little smaller than some other Costco stores around. They have limited options.</review>

The only complaint I have is that the Manager in the Vision Dept. informed me to get my contacts online, then I told him that I have great benefits, then he said, "Oh, you would order them here then." Then when my contacts finally came 2wks later, when I called to ask the girl if they were there yet, she told me that they hadn't shipped yet! Later that afternoon, I received a call from their automated system stating that they were there! What a "run around"!  Regardless,  everyone else has always been so kind!<//text><rate>4</rate><Time>1500503968947< /Time><user_id>103917556430789528525< /user_id>< Response>

Costco need a much bigger place. Since displaying most their sales for the month right by the entrance, so now your looking at worst traffic to get in and around.</Review><gmapID>0x809b1ff000000001:0x6040260c93ea3659< /gmapID>< Date>

I like it, it has pretty much everything you need ( lots of varieties)  But the when looking for a spot to sit to eat, it is very cramped. And I do love their samples and how every staff member there is nice, but their glasses( not the glasses themselves) will not be accepted without the prescription on printed paper, won't even let you email them it or use their printer, so, ups and downs.</Review>

There will always be a special place in my heart for Costco. The bustle for samples can sometimes be a bit overwhelming but the store itself is all you need for bulk purchases and deals. Some of my favorite items include the cookies from the bakery, multivitamins (great price), Aidells Sausages. The Store brand (Kirkland) is well trusted and provides great value. This location offers a food court ($1.50 hot dog and soda combo!! You can’t beat that. Also, it just recently started to offer cheeseburgers which I havent seen at other locations), as well as a fuel pump with some of the best gas prices in the area.

Eye Center/optometry: Advertised as open from Monday to Saturday but when I was at the store on Sunday, they had a doctor available! Walk ins possible but only if someone doesn’t show up, so your best chance is to make an appointment. Very professional doctor and proper eye exam.</review>

<Review>The parking is always a nightmare. I'm retired and quite frankly I am not sure where all the customers are from.  Don't they work? The prices and return policies  have kept me as a customer  still. Some customers are quite rude or in a bad mood. This situation could cause a customer to think whether it is worth the money saved shopping there.</Review>< Rating>

It's Costco... You know what you're getting. Prices are fair and selection is what it is. But there are rarely incredible bargains. It's just major bulk at reasonable prices.</Text>

Why do you keep shoving the spinich in the freezer? You can't hold it there for 20-30 mins.  The broken structure of the leaves shows it.  This is the worst Costco for greens. I made the mistake of going here. Everywhere else is good, citrus heights and Folsom are good. Wish i couod post my pic here</Text>

Go early or very late.  Otherwise, it will be crowded.  Good deals, especially if you can purchase in bulk.< /Review>

Had what I needed this time. Dose not always have what we need. What happen to the selling of Woolite? Costco is a bit overrated, and I don't understand why everyone thinks it's so great.</Review>

Love this Costco location. More organic foods than any other location that I've been to. Friendly & helpful employees :) Don't like that it's always busy but I guess that's because it's a great store.< /text>

<Review>Clean, well stocked, but the place is a complete zoo.  The parking lot is figuratively hell, and bumpercars, combined.  Inside, people will run you over, shove their way through, and are generally rude.  An absolutely miserable shopping area, thus the reason I rarely shop here, and docked it two stars.  Sam's (nearby) is a much nicer place to get your bulk shopping done.< /Review>< Date>

Don't get me wrong "I LOVE COSTCO", but not the Roseville one! RIDICOUSLY OVER PACKED ALL THE TIME! I would rather drive to Chico or Woodland.< /Review>

I cannot see how anyone approved of the parking in this place it's inferior and dangerous. I hope we have better engineers in the county and or state that oversee the new building and Construction in Redding. This is a shameful engineering feet and I am a retired civil engineer< /Text>

I just had two items to return. I waited in line for about 12-15 minutes. I was treated with respect and the transaction was completed quickly. No one likes to wait in line but this Costco is almost always quite busy.< /review>

<review>Great selection and pricing.  Only drawback is it's almost always crowded with long check out lines.....I find that's the case at most Costco stores I've shopped at.  Guess they're doing things right.<//review>< pictures>

Ever since they installed the gas station the parking lot is horrible but it's not Cisco's fault it's the city that made them do all of that.  No place to put your carts in the parking lot.  Never go here on the 1st of the month.  It's a great store but just always crowded.<//Text><userid>105108871495925991216< /userid></record>

Can I give negative stars? I used to be a Costco fan, but not anymore. The greaters are beyond rude if I don't have my membership cards pulled out fast enough. This location is also insanely busy, as if rude people isn't bad enough. I'll go to Sam's.<//text>

Bought a pair of sunglasses during the roadshow. They should alert anyone buying a pair that the wait at the Optical department to pick up the purchase is over 30 minutes<//review>

I love Costco, but I had a bad experience at this location. I probably spend about $10,000 a year at Costco from food to sheds, you name it I've probably bought it there. In all the years I've shopped there I've maybe returned one thing before this incident. So my partner and I walk up to the return counter and tell the employee we want to return three pair of pants that don't fit. The pants where in good condition and never worn. The employee says, "did you even buy these"? My partner replied, " of course I did, how else would I have gotten them"? The employee then says, "well it doesn't look like you bought these." We we're in shock by he accusations. While he reluctantly refunded our money, I went to find a manager and tell him what the employee had said and the manager was trying to act like my homeboy. He was like, "ahhh nah nah nah he didn't mean it like that, he just meant it like he didn't know if it was our merchandise or not, we cool ." I was like no we're not cool, I don't appreciate being accused of stealing something. He just started at me. I said I was hoping when I came to you I would be reassured and you would tell me that you would talk to your employee about return policies and good customer service. He was like yah no prob I can do that. I'll talk to him. I was like thank you and walked away. I knew it was a lost cause. I know to some this isn't a big deal, but it's extremely humiliating to be accessed of such an act, especially from a company I have huge respect for and admire.< /Text>

<text>Lines here are almost always long. The best time to go is as soon as it opens. This costco has a food court. They have recently added a few more checkstands to help with the holiday rush.

Lowest price gas in the area - enough to pay for your membership annually + savings within the warehouse of great items.

Highly recommended.</text>

I love this place! Can't wait to get a membership card! Not!
Got kicked out of the parking lot at the Citrus Highs store parking lot due to handing out flyers for a Colon Cancer run in Citrus Highs. It's a yearly event. Raising money for cancer research it's very important.
Walmart let me hand out the last of my flyers.
Thanks Walmart :-)< /review>

<Date>1522002373180</Date><Rating>4</Rating><Text>If people don't already know, membership is required to shop here. The prices are reasonable and you will find name brand items for less than elsewhere. A little bit of everything is sold here. Some things are seasonably available when the time is right, other things are staples and are available year round. Still other things come and go with apparently no rhyme or reason. This is my main reason for not giving Costco 5 stars, is I have gone on more than one occasion hoping to get something I have previously had, only to find they stopped carrying it. It's difficult to go to Costco without spending a large amount of money, but as long as you have storage space for the bulk products you can save in the long run.< /Text>< Pics>

You can move around pretty well in this very busy store. Great for going up and down the aisles. It can be a little tricky finding specific items. Stockers can be down right rude if you ask them more than one quick question so only 3 stars</Review>

A rental car, a vacation, home insurance, hearing aids and glasses, as well as food, AV equipment, wine, produce, etc, etc.
They are an ethical company that treats its employees very well, gives them health plans and a living wage, and their CEO doesn't make millions of dollars. Highly recomended.< /Text>< Rate>

A nightmare of a store that is prone to inducing panic and anxiety attacks. They are never not crazy busy. From the parking lot to the store it is so crowded it feels like you are always a step away from bumping into someone or something.</Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I work at the WDS, that's the fancy way of saying those folks who hand out samples. In my time there I have notice a very friendly, helpful and secure environment to do your shopping quickly. Only suggestion I have would be to add in an express lane, darn lines are crazy!</review>< pics>

Great place to shop, plenty of variety (as far as competing Costco's go). Parking can be difficult here, they need more space - hence the 4 stars.</Review>

for the past 10+ years ive been going to the two sacramento area costcos. this one has a good selection of items, better organized than Stockton blvd location, not as crazy busy either. weekends get very busy, so I just try to go around opening or closing to beat the crowds.<//Text>

<text>Many seasonal deals on roadshow merchandise, but these products move out and are not available just as you grew to like them, their gone. Most regular products are not priced at wholesale as it should.

it's a Costco gas station out front usually the gas lines are not as long as most Costco's there's a lot of pumps here it's pretty wide the lines seemed to go pretty quick... really the worst part of the experience of going to Costco is the traffic and the parking sometimes there's just so many people and it's a very busy intersection< /review>

<date>1435716878829</date><Rate>5<//Rate><review>I would like to express my appreciation for the care I received in the Hearing Aid Center by Allene C. I purchased hearing aids for both ears almost a year ago, they were set up by another person in that department, I made more than one appt. they never seemed  right, couldn't watch TV without close captions, couldn't understand many people's voices. Yesterday I had an appt with Allene, she checked my records and determined I needed another hearing test, she accomplished it, set up my aids, It's like I awoke in a new world of hearing, turned off the close captions on TV, turned volume down. I can hear things I've missed  for the last several years. Allene was professional and caring !
Thank you Costco for hiring such an excellent professional in your hearing Dept !</review>< pictures>

< review>
This place survives because of the brand reputation and prices. The staff is slow and egotistical. Very strange for an hourly gig. Pharmacy is very slow and line at food court could stop completely for 5-min for no reason at all. Mgmt keeps as few cash registers open as possible. Is there a bonus for keeping lines long or 3 registers open at near peak times? I've shopped at Costco stores in 12 states and this location is the worst I've seen. Don't even ask about parking issues.<//review>

Been to many Costcos and this one is pretty much the same but it's one if the busiest even on weekdays. Still the same old Costco but 4* because the foot traffic is nuts.< /Text>

Love costco. Today the pharmacist went above and beyond, with my dogs meds. He was reciewing her meds and then he asked if i signed up for their discount program. He checked, i didn't. He had me fill out thos slip , rerang my dogs meds and i got $20.65 back. I was thrilled. Costco has great deals, cheap gas and pays their workers a living wage with good benefits i am told.. Customer for life!!!<//review>

This is honestly a great Costco. The three star rating is because it's impossible to go here without serious crowding and long long lines,  both inside and at the pump.<//review>

<Date>1511078384969< /Date><Rate>3<//Rate><Text>This location is by far the most busiest. Parking is always full. Gas pumps always jammed packed. Rude customers at the parking lot, gas pump and inside the store.

Some employees show their frustration on their faces when dealing with these people. Location is not ideal especially for a growing city like Roseville and Rocklin.

Prices are inconsistent with neighboring Costco's. We did a comparison on some normally stocked items. I think this location knows its residents highest median income range.<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<review>I come to Costco for my family monthly shopping! They ONLY  take debit & American express. I can't afford to shop here every week as i do at our local Yuba city Sam's club with limited payment options & 1hr drive from my home...why I shop here once a month. The staff are helpful & I've bought 2 dslrs here at exceptionally discounted price! Keep it up & consider coming to Plumas lake, ca!🙄< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Their return policies have changed, 90 days then you get to fight with the manufacture.  Been doing that for 4 days and still have a non working TV.

Good gas price, but eating area was very cramped and needed attention. I know that there are a lot of slobs, but we still need to try.< /Text>

<review>I shopped around to find an LED TV and located the cheapest price at Costco then when I went in and used my Costco credit card to purchase the TV I was informed by the pleasent and knowledgeable cashier that I would receive a four-year warranty on the TV for FREE. Nothing better than saving money and getting an extended warranty for FREE. On my way out I use my Costco credit card to purchase the cheapest gas in town. Thanks Costco!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Review>I rarely go to Costco Rocklin. My bi-monthly Costco visit is usually to the Folsom store...much friendlier and cater to boxing for my 1 hour+ journey home with expert organizing of what I need to keep cold. This time however-as I was again reboxing EVERYTHING I had somehow dropped my $200 sunglasses in the process and didn't realize they were missing until I got outside. Retracing my footsteps and sadly  arriving at the end register that I had checked out on, I asked the young man there if he had seen them and he smiled and said yes and that he had turned them in at the managers desk. I retrieved my sunglasses and walked away feeling very different about the Rocklin store!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Always busy. Purchased mushroom ravioli that has glass in the ravioli on 8/4/2017 - no one seemed concerned when returned other half of package and showed the shards of glass; purchased a whole combo pizza on 8/8/2017 and somehow the crust was moldie.< /text>

Crazy to think of a box store as "friendly", but staff has been here so long you start to know them. The buyers always seem to know exactly what you want, so it can be a dangerous store where your wallet is concerned! More organic products on the shelves every time I shop. Go later in the evening  to skip the longer lines.</text>

<text>Too crowded and has long lines at checkout stands. It's practically impossible to navigate the aisles because there are so many people.  Most prices are MUCH higher than other stores, Ex. Ham for $3.49 to $4.99 per pound is $0.97 to $1.07 at WinCo. Parking lot is always crowded too. It's not worth paying membership fees. You can do better by shopping at $0.99 Store, Aldi, Big Lots, Grocery Outlet, Walmart and WinCo. Costco's new online grocery charges 20% to 35% than their in-store process. Probably to cover their "free" shipping but, that's a ridiculously upcharge for shipping. People are fools to shop here. We'll be cancelling our membership.<//text>< pics>

Supposedly, it's the smallest Costco in California? I really couldn't say. Everytime I walk in - as soon as they open midweek without any surrounding holidays, or lunchtime on a weekend - it doesn't matter - it feels like a blue-light special at K-Mart has just popped up on EVERY SINGLE ITEM as soon as you walk in. Or, if you don't remember blue-light special dashes, it's like the Beanie Baby craze and the insane lines just to, somehow, fall in to a dumpster-sized basket full of Princess Diana Bears just to claim them all. It's literally like that, but on EVERYTHING. Don't get me wrong, the staff is amazingly nice, but the absolute SEA OF PEOPLE is astounding. If I want just a few things, I'll skip this store in favor of Wal-Mart or Sams, just to avoid such crowds or long lines - in any department.< /Text>

If long waits and substandard customer service is what you want, then Costco is for you.
If you are more like me and you recognize that sometimes the price is right and they have what you need, then sometime you suffer for the end product.<//text>

Its Costco, its great...but this stores size, seems smaller than the others I've been to...plus it seems to be the only one in the area, so very high traffic...which means its location is packed, very tight parking and a nightmare on the weekends. Heard about a Costco in Auburn?</Review>

< Review>
Costco is costco, however, this one is VERY disorganized and scattered. Theres no flow and no one around to ask questions to. Take a page on organization from the Boise store and make it easier to find things by groupings. And for God sakes, wider aisles! Clean up the aisles folks!< /Review>

< review>
Purchased 3 Whole Chickens. NO FLAVOR WHAT SO EVER! We have been to 5 different Costcos in the last 9 years. This is the first time I wish I stopped at Taco Bell (YUCK) Horrible ! VERY VERY  disappointed . I live 45 minutes above Valley Springs so was looking forward to the Whole chickens . Purchased 3 at approx. 2PM on March/13/2018<//review>

Costco can't be beat, the customer service is excellent and all products have money back guarantees. This place is a total zoo on the weekend though so be prepared.</text>

Worst Costco ever. Its small, its crowded and full of really old people who leave there carts in the middle of isles and walk really slow. The parking lot is also crazy to get in and out of. Avoid this costco if you can</text>

Hate going here. It is way overcrowded. They don't open up more registers when it is 15+ people deep.  I live in Roseville but would rather drive to Citrus Heights.</review>

Bigger Costco, Lot of Crowd on weekends. Parking is more but still you will end up hard to find a spot.  More varieties than other costco.</Review>

(Translated by Google) What you can buy at Costco should never be bought elsewhere, because it is basically the lowest price!

能在Costco 买到的东西绝对不要去别处买，因为基本上就是最低价了!<//Text>
