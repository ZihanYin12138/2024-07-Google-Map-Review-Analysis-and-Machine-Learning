Dr DiMaccio is the best dentist I have had the pleasure to meet. I have been to many different dentists as a former flight attendant I have lived in many different states and In Iceland as well, therefore I have seen many different dentists .  I have always had terrible anxiety when I needed to have dental work done to the point I have I paid dearly for putting off seeing a dentist when needed. Since I met Dr DiMaccio all my anxiety is gone, he has a special technique when numbing that I don’t feel a thing, I don’t understand how he does it, I’ve never known a dentist that can do that. All my visits have been painless and pleasant because of all the wonderful kind people that work with Dr DiMaccio, starting with the front desk to finish, I look forward to going the dentist now, all my kids and little granddaughter see him also and they are perfectly fine and happy to go to the dentist. I am so grateful to have found this dentist, what a relief.

I had the hygienist, Kimberly, do my cleaning and x-rays yesterday, and she did a great job! I saw Abby and had my teeth whitened,  which was also a positive experience!!</Text>

I really like Dr d, I have been coming to the cost of dental for the last 11 years, I've tried a couple other dentists but it seems though every time I go in there I have a good experience and the prices are reasonable so why change! I do like their reminder system, and sometimes even does some dentist stuff for free and I really appreciated that<//text>

John P. DiMaccio is the only dentist we have used since we moved to Carlsbad in 2006.  We would not think of going to another dentist.  Dr. DiMaccio and his staff are professional, courteous and efficient.<//Review>

< Review>
Have you ever been to a doctor to get a shot, and the nurse is so good at it that you barely even feel that it went in? That's this place. I had plaque in my gums, and Dental Hygienist Patricia cleaned deep in my gums and it only felt like a normal teeth cleaning! I've gotten them cleaned elsewhere and it hurt so much that I probably left claw marks on the chair from gripping so hard. Anyway, everyone was really friendly and good at their job! Definitely going back!<//Review>

I love this place! Dr. DiMaccio is extremely personable and talented! He always takes the time to answer my questions and put me at ease. Hands down the best dentist I've ever had! I always feel welcome here and Gina and the staff even took care of my baby while I had my teeth cleaned. It makes me feel like they truly care. I also want to give a shout out to my hygienist Erin who was the nicest and most caring hygienist I've had. Thank you for your kindness Erin! 😄<//review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>First of all I’d like to say that I normally experience extreme anxiety when I go to the dentist and I didn’t even once while I was there today. The staff are all warm and friendly, and the Dr. is incredible, very knowledgeable and to the point. I have the upmost confidence in this practice. I have a broken tooth and they got me in first thing this morning and intervened immediately to get me out of pain and fight infection. They were very direct and straight forward with my treatment plan, only addressing the immediate issue, not my entire mouth. I have ran into that time after time, where they give you an overall estimate of your whole mouth. It’s much more approachable when you break it down into steps instead of an overwhelming entire mouth treatment plan. I am so grateful I found them and I highly recommend this office. I actually look forward to coming back to get my work done! That’s a first for me! Thank you La Costa Dental Care! Everyone from the front desk Traci, & Gina to the dental assistant and Dr. DiMaccio are all amazing.<//Text><UserId.>100630894614742365496</UserId.>< Pics>

If I could give them a 10 star I would. I just had my Mercury filling redone with the new composites! It was quick, painless, and my teeth look absolutely beautiful! As soon as I walked into the office, the front desk manager, Gina Hirata,  exceeded with customer care! She was extremely friendly, her smile lights up a room, and a lot of fun to be around. There was hardly any waiting time, they were very quick, and the staff was very on top of things. Dr. DiMaccio is very compassionate and very thorough and comforting. I had TMJ and he relieved it with his own technique that was very quick and easy. It felt like family there and I'll always go to them for all my dental needs! Love them!<//text>

Do not come here!...the owner sells stereos at a higher price. I went to get a stereo installed. Which I had bought somewhere else. I was sure that my stereo worked, however he did not help to make sure that my stereo worked prior to instalation. He charged me to install only to find out that my stereo didn't work. (Not his fault) he then advised that I buy a new one from his shop. He opens the new stereo and he tests inside to guarantee that it works. This guy had the option to help me prior to all of this testing my stereo that I brought for installation. Instead I left out of that shop disappointed and dissatisfied. Total rip off and bad business. Will not come here anymore and will not recommended. Do your research on stereos first.< /review>

Always friendly.  Great haircut.  I do not use any particular stylist.   Remember to leave a good tio.  These folks have been struggling for the last year.   I have always enjoyed going here.</Review>

Great place with a very nice staff. Tons of sports games on Tv's all over and lots of different services including hot towels and a neck and shoulder massage if you get the higher package. Never had a bad haircut going there. The only issue is it's always super busy. Like hour plus wait if you just walk in. On the positive or negative side, depending on how you look at it, they now have online check in. If you don't use it, you could be the one person there but another 9 in line ahead of you who are all on the way. I would recommend using the online check in so you can run an errand or wait at home and head down around the time it gives you for your approx. wait.<//Text>

Yes; they are busy.  Get there well before they open and you'll be first to get your hair cut. Or you can sign in online and then arrive when it's your turn.

Everyone there is friendly and they do a fine job cutting hair.

It's a little pricey for a cut imho; but I like the people that work there so we keep going.</review>

<rate>2< /rate><text>So inconsistent at this location. I live between two and I’ll never be back. Precious hair cut was terrible and I’ve never seen the same person in here twice and they’re always being shadowed by a trainer. 515pm on a Saturday, online check in says 5 minutes wait - I pull up 3 minutes later and open sign is off and they’re turning people away. Magically now it says “no info” and to call. As I sit outside the salon & 536pm - I’m watching stylists leave. Great way to run a business - you must not be worried about client experience or profits. I’ll take my business elsewhere.

With that said - visit the Clayton Center location, customer service is always on point, the same group of stylists are always there and you get treated like you matter, downfall they have shorter hours and it’s difficult to get in to for 9-5’ers.< /text>< pictures>

The staff is amazing, they work very well as a team and support each other. Jessica is my hair stylist and she’s always spot on making sure she meets my expectations with a 1st. Attention to detail, I recommend this shop to everyone 👏🏻 👍🏻 ☝🏻<//text>

I got a text message 10 minutes before someone was available and walked in two minutes after. I was TURNED AWAY because they were too busy and gave my sons spot away. Barely two minutes after I got the ten minute warning. Not only that, but the staff was UNBELIEVABLY RUDE in he process.  I get that stuff happens but you don’t have to blatantly condescending to a potential paying customer. We will absolutely never be going back.</text><username>Nicole Ronquillo< /username><Date>1539558921209</Date>< gmapID>

<review>Samantha takes care of my son every time and is so sweet to him. Giving a hair cut to a toddler can be difficult but she explains everything to him in a way that he can understand so that he sits still the entire time. She engages in conversation with him and his hair cut comes out perfect every time!<//review><Date>1502727510659</Date>< pictures>

Great place to get a hair cut.  Cecelia cut my hair  2 days ago and I actually feel good about myself .  Its the hair cut.  I usually have to wait a while but I was getting my hair cut after 10 minutes waiting.  Been a customer for 7 years.
Kudos to Cecilia for her hair cutting skills!
Customer for life!

Great experience. Very attentive staff who are eager to please. The facility is welcoming, clean and TVs were tuned to Sport appropriate channels. The check in system in store and online are genius.
Thank you<//review>

Professional and polite staff, clean and professional environment. Adequate haircut that can be finished off with optional treatments such as a hot towel and hair wash, and a neck message. Might cost a bit more than the standard haircut chain but they also offer more than the standard haircut chain.</Text>

4.5 also.
I just like the service.   The 2 stylists I have had were very good especially the 1 on my last trip this past Sunday.   Wanted something simple,  & she did it. Needed it for my business trip next week.<//Review>

Got here 10 minutes before opening. Still waited for a hour to get seen.  It's a Saturday and only two stylists. I get it, but come on now... They need to get some more help.   Ok haircut, only they were short staffed. Help wanted sign outside. Only went cause my personal barber was on vacay. Gave it 3 stars cause they are friendly. Hope this helps</Review>

They do not greet you.  You sign in by computer. Your  name and length of wait is posted on electronic screen on wall. I waited 45 minutes and it started over with and additional  wait of 50 minutes with no explanation. When I asked why, I was told the person had gone to lunch. No apology, nothing. I left and will never go back.</text>

<review>The mvp haircut is why i've been coming back. Of the 3 haircuts i've gotten here 2 of them were amazing. My haircut is pretty simple. Half fade on the sides and nothing off the top. One girl absolutely butchered this though and when i asked her to blend in my sideburns, hit me with a 0 inbetween the top of my sideburn and my hair line. I walked around for about a week with two bald hard lines on the top of my sideburns. The whole time she was talking about how excited she was to go on vacation soon.< /review>< gmap_id>

<review>The hair stylist Phoung was very professional. She took her time and asked my opinion every step of the way. If their was something wrong, she changed it to how I would see it. I have no issues with SportClips and the competition cannot even touch them. Facility is clean and the staff is freindly.The only downfall is the wait times. Understand though that they are in high demand and you could be waiting 45mins to 1hr 15mins for a stylist, however it is well worth the wait.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Went to get my side hair trimmed didn't even do it evenly, that's probably the worst barber shop I have ever been to and on top of a bad trimming she charged me $20 for it ridiculous will never go back again I don't mind the money but at least do the job right.< /Review>

< Review>
We booked a trip to red hawk casino.  Never heard from them and they said they would send info.  So I called 3 days before trip. I was told we hadn't paid and were not on the list. They wanted me to pay again if we wanted to go.  So I just figured the credit card hadn't gone thru.  So we said no. Then day of trip 10 minutes before bus left they  called said we were on the list and we're we still going
We don't live in Fresno weren't ready so I said will they wait. But they were leaving in 10 minutes.
Then that same day (Saturday) got visa card bill and they had charged our account 70 dollars.  This was in December still waiting for refund<//Review>

Great 4th of July trip. Our bus driver was awesome and the bus was very clean.  The other bus driver Dennis was very rude and condescending. A simple yes or no question quickly broke our good mood.  Other than that, the drive to and from was awesome.</review>

We have been using best tours for years for our school field trips. We just had a pumpkin patch trip and our driver was very courteous with our small children and overall a great experience! We will be using them for another upcoming trip in December!!!</text>

Jasmine at Best Tours & Travel is ABSOLUTELY amazing! At the drop of a hat when our plans fall through, she magically makes it happen! The drivers have been amazing, friendly and are knowledgeable while on the road with places to eat and sights to see. Thank you Best Tours & Travel for your support to make the FPU Department of Athletics a success while on the road!</Text>

Our company recently worked with best Tours and Travel to take a group of employees on a casino trip. The trip quickly grew from 56 people and 1 bus to over 150 people and 3 busses. Jasmine was wonderful in helping us with the planning and coordination of the trip. Our 3 bus drivers were friendly, fun, and above all professional. I would highly recommend using Best Tours and Travel for any group travel needs<//text>

Booked 2 seats to Disneyland for my daughter and I. Best decision ever! It gave us the lost time that I would've spent driving ourselves, for us to spend with each other. With no "Are we there yet?". Bus was clean and driver was very professional. I would  100% recommend Best Tours and Travel for anyone's travel needs. Thanks Best Tours!<//review>

<text>I love this place. Took a bit of a break, but they remembered me. I was surprised, but God bless them! Trips are fun, affordable and easy. Friendly drivers and staff. They’re also Fresno/Clovis residents who try to stay involved in the community so it’s always a huge bonus to support a family business. If you have any problems, just tell them and they’ll do whatever they can to fix.

I saw a review in which the gentleman mentioned he bought his ticket through Groupon so I began searching to see if there was anything I liked... I couldn’t find anything because as it turns out they don’t use Groupon and never have, so poor guy must have dealt with a different Best Tours.<//text><UserId.>117211963511496330146< /UserId.><GmapID>0x80945dfb078b6d77:0x65586f487a717fca</GmapID><Rate>5< /Rate><pics>None< /pics></record></dataset><record>

I've traveled numerous times with this particular company and have continued using their services throughout the years simply because they are the BEST!!! Each time, my friends including myself are greeted warmly by their morning "check-in greeter" and never fail to keep me feeling welcomed & safe from the beginning to the end of our travels. This last trip my friends and I took to Magic Mountain, the women remembered who I am and made me feel like a person and not just a number, much like the "other" companies. Two thumbs up in my book. Hhmmm, where to travel next?< /review>

My name is Cynthia Bean, I have been working together with Jasmine in the fresno office on McKinley going on 12 years now annually. I would to compliment the professional and personal experiences I've had all these years. Professional because they're always extremely friendly, always on time, the bus has always been clean and the drivers always has great personalities, Personal because Jasmine makes you feel like family, she goes beyond call of duty to meet your accommodations. I highly recommend best tours to all my family and friends and I'm looking forward to this coming up adventure. Thank you so much, I rate you as 5 stars........</text>

<review>I booked a trip to Monterey with best tours and travels. I have used many different agencies throughout the years for different trips in Canada and US and I can say by far that this is the best company I've ever dealt with. The fleets were new and super clean from the seats to the floors to the washroom. The service is personalized and impeccable. The staff which I assume are the owners since it is a family business are the sweetest and most caring I have dealt with. The bus driver we had on this trip was the best driver! It was a long 3.5hrs drive from Fresno to Monterey but they trip was smooth and entertaining since the driver was telling funny stories and talking about the history of a few places along the road. The buses are fully equipped and most importantly for me is the service and unlike the comment listed below I can assure you that this is by far the best customer service we have received! I highly recommend this company to anybody that is looking for a trip! Rating it 5 stars and I'm definitely doing business with them again</review>< GmapID>

Me and my Husband have enjoyed many trips with Best tours, they have great prices for many places. We have went to Yosemite, Monterey, Pismo a few times and Pier 39 recently. We are planning on visiting Yosemite next month. The buses are always clean, comfortable and bus driver's are friendly. I would recommend trying them out, they are always friendly and it beats driving there and back, just my opinion.< /review>

My girlfriend bought us a couple bus trips with this company. The trips were fun (thanks to her), but the service from the business wasn't very impressive. If you're going to call yourself the "best" then you should at least be good. The times of arrival and departure were never even close and the young lady who verified everyone was on the bus and ready to go had a lot of attitude. Maybe it was too early for her, but we've decided to stop using this company. There are others out there who do a better job and the employees are much more pleasant. We don't regret switching at all as we've used different companies, but something about this one just didn't seem right. You might have better luck, but we gave them two chances and they failed both times.<//review>

An amazing company!!  The family owns and works the business very professionally and they hold a high regard for ethics.  So accommodating, friendly, and their desire is for you to have the best possible time.  I have taken trips for 16 years and I only trust Best Tours.  I just went on their Paso Robles Wine tour, and it was crazy fun.  All the details were taken care of, the driver had personality and assisted in making the trip memorable, the people enjoyed great wine tasting and a fabulous time in Paso Robles for lunch.  I would highly recommend any trip that Best Tours takes.  I have been to Reno, Las Vegas, Laughlin, Monterey, Pismo, Solvang, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and so many Casinos with Best Tours and have always arrived safely and had a wonderful time, and I am completely satisfied with their service.  Thank you to Jasmine, Nadine, Nicole, Margaret, and to all the Drivers.  You truly are the "Best" in service.<//Text>

I had scheduled a walking tour of Venice through group with Best Tours-- was really looking forward to it!
48 hours before the tour was to take place, I received a text that Best Tours had cancelled the tour due to low numbers. Seems a bit unprofessional to cancel an engagement for that reason, but OK.
When I contacted Best Tours to receive a refund--I did not want a reschedule-- I chatted with a respresntative. The representative disconnected without resolving my issue and left for several minutes. When I finally reconnected, the rep told me that Best Tours could not handle my refund since I went through Groupon-- I had to do it myself.

Ridiculous. First, you put me through the inconvenience of cancellation and having to make new plans, and THEN you make me go through a complicated web at groupon to get my refund. What terrible customer service. I would highly DISCOURAGE anyone from dealing with Best Tours</text>

{'time': 1583883909784, 'text': 'Hello Evan we greatly appreciate your feedback, but regret to inform you that this is for Best Tours & Travel located in Fresno, California. We are solely a charter bus company. We do not offer Venice walking tours nor do we use Groupon. I fear you may have mistakenly posted a review for the wrong company. We did a little research and saw that there are businesses that offer walking tours under the name of BestTours but are not affiliated with our company in any way and are not located in the Central Valley. If you are ever in the Fresno area and are in need of a charter bus service we would be happy to assist you.'}</Response>

<Review>awful, do not trust them.
I called them a month before my event. I was told the date is secure and they gave me the price ,but they never send me the contract. I called them three times within two weeks and asked for the contract. Every time I was told that they are working on it and I should receive the contract by the end of the day . I never received the contract and I  just gave up on them and went to a different company.<//Review><gmapID>0x80945dfb078b6d77:0x65586f487a717fca< /gmapID>< resp>

<review>If you're looking to pick up some high quality 3D printer filament, Matterhackers is one of the best sources. Their little office / warehouse just Southeast of Irvine offers order collection of online purchases as well as walk-up service. Slightly off the beaten path, but potentially worth the trek if you're in the LA area or if you want to actually touch the material before buying.< /review>< user_id>

I love matterhackers, Shipping is light speed. All three of my ultimakers are from them. I ordered one last week and it came in one day, best ever. the rewards system is also a super bonus on why you should order filament from here.

5 stars. do not change!!!</Text>

<review>I've been using matterhackers for my filaments and supplies exclusively for a couple years now.  They have quality products and keep them in stock consistently.  Their prices are very reasonable as well.  Any time I've had a minor issue they have gone above and beyond to take care of it.  I highly recommend them.</review><date>1498767630995<//date>< Pics>

Excellent filament! Some of the best I've used. Color as well as the diameter holds very true when extruded . The price is also great for the extremely high quality product.< /Review>

Every problem or concern I have had has been solved by their helpful and tech savvy staff. To this day I will still refer people to MatterHackers because of their knowledge and experience in 3D printing.<//review>< Pics>

Your response was great!!! I was able to reach someone on the phone ( on Saturday I can't believe it)and explain my problem with the matter control touch and after emailing a couple of files. Kevin was able to narrow the problem to the auto print leveling. I reconfigured auto print leveling and now every thing is working fine. I have had my printer for over a year now and used several open software programs but had to switch back and forth between them until I found Matter Control software after trying it I was sold. It is the best software yet. After using this software I purchased the Matter control touch which is one of the best add on device I have found for my printer, Way to go Matter Control !!!!!!!< /review>

I ordered online and my order was shipped very promptly, and the filament is a good value for the cost. The white spool was opaque and exactly as expected. I'd use them again, knowing what to expect.< /Review>

I placed an order on the 29th of July, and I received it on the 30th. California to Chicago! Fast!  And the shipping was free!

I just need to say that your customer service is fabulous. Fast, true to your description, very good pricing.....Thanks so much!

I am at this very moment printing the PLA filament I just received from you........Beautiful! Great print; fantastic quality! 1.75 mm filament was spot on, 1.75mm, very consistent diameter.  And, each spool of filament I received was nicely vacuum packed.

I've placed several orders with you, including my printer, and the service was great.  Carefully packed and no damage.

Thanks so much!<//text>

The Pro series is very good quality PLA and the red is opaque and bright which is hard to find. Works great on my Makerbot Replicator 2.</review>

<review>Great, finally found an official distributer of genuine E3D V6 hotends in the states, great communication with Rhonda (thanks Rhonda), quick turnaround time and fast shipping just two days to the San Francisco Bay Area. Just ordered spare parts for my V6 hotend last night and will be back for filament.  Thank you!</review><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>I suggest avoiding this store altogether. I came all the way from Bakersfield just to have them adjust a printhead, and i was treated like a rat by Matthew, the product manager. Maybe it was because he didn't want me to leave the store without being charged first, i don't know. But charging me $70 for something that only took a couple minutes is INSANE, AND he wasn't even the mechanic to repair my printer! Before they moved offices and changed faculty, they didn't have a corporate attitude where they'd charge you $70 for a simple adjustment. Do NOT go to this store unless you want a rude a-hole charge you $70 every half hour, when he's not even the one fixing the printer to begin with. Apparently, Matthew had a very elitist attitude, and ONLY cares about selling expensive 3D printers. He needs to work on his personality, because it is HORRIBLE. I will give another star only because the mechanic solved my situation kindly at no cost.< /Text><Rate>2<//Rate><userid>116980514325866593966< /userid><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp><time>1415256701810</time>< username>

Blanca and her team are great hosts. Fine menu of Mexican favorites. Also, the hamburgers are really good (surprising for a Mexican restaurant).</text>

I eat in this spot a lot since I work in the area. I must say their customer service is always good and they keep the spot well kept consistently. Prices are reasonable and they serve large portions.< /Review>

<text>One of my regular stops each week in Hughson. Food is great & service is even better! I always get enough to eat & the price is always affordable. You will find all the locals here throughout the week, which is telling of a good small town restaurant. Check it out, I highly recommend stopping in!</text>< user_id>

Really can't emphasize how much I loved the food here... Massive portions of delicious plant-based food at a fair price, with the best hospitality. Definitely coming back next time I'm in the area!< /Text>

Delicious deserts and muffins, fantastic food. This natural organic Café is a neighborhood gem.  It is completely non-dairy and mostly vegan, but with specially sourced organic free range chicken options and add ons.
They have Venezuelan specialties, like arepas on the weekend, along with delicious bowls, tacos, salads, and breakfast options.
Google maps makes it a little hard to find with the correct address, but incorrect driving directions.
It is on the main street, but with parking behind.< /text>

The owner Rosa has been very helpful and carefully pays attention to needs in regards to health. I am a diabetic, she always asks specifically what ingredients I want and makes sugar free suggestions when it comes to orders. Definitely will be a loyal customer and support her business for she is a wise and very polite person. Definitely show this business some love and ofcourse keep healthy as possible . Peace and love 🙌< /Review>

This place is awesome! If you come on the weekend, they serve a Arepas, a traditional Venezuelan dish, kind of like a thick corn tortilla with all sorts of good stuff inside. It was SO GOOD! And they have a great little outdoor patio for safe dining during COVID. Great customer service! Come support a local business!</review>

A huge amount of natural product and hard to find in this store! A full-service cafe and bakery with comfortable table seating. I really like the Bob's Red Mill selections. They're one of my favorites! And they have a wide variety of them. A huge fresh selection of nuts and dried fruits in the bulk area with bulk spices too! A good-sized parking lot in the rear makes in and out visits convenient and you don't have to worry about Artesia traffic.
Perfect store for health nuts who like nuts! Hahaha</Text>

I have been a healthy eater for years.  Unfortunately, healthy food and tasty food are not always the same thing......The food at this place is both wonderful tasting and healthy!  And did I mention the price is amazingly reasonable?  Their veggie burger is just wonderful!< /review>

Food (arepa) was ok, but getting it was painfully slow. There were no other food orders ahead of us or after us on a Saturday morning, and it took more than half an hour. Call ahead, otherwise I can't recommend it, and even then, it's good but not great (P.S. - adding to original review: the muffin that my wife brought home the following week was very good)</Review>

Amazing market & cafe with tons of healthy food and product selections.  Friendly staff, very clean and incredible aroma and natural feel. I had the breakfast sandwich special (tomato, vegan cheese, basil paste, avocado, etc.) and it was so awesome, definitely the best ever I had. You can park on the street or there's also abundant parking if you go around to the back street, so make sure you go check it out!! Great place!!</review>

<Review>Hello, new obsession. Finally stopped into check this sorta-still-new neighborhood spot out and grab lunch. We had the vegan burger and a quinoa salad. It was So. Good. Very fresh and flavorful. Took one of the homemade gluten free pastries for snacking later 😋 It is also a market with high quality bulk items. Will be stopping by soon for a coffee and to grab some great baking staples.<//Review>< Pics>

<Text>Nice vibe here. Delicious food and friendly people. Had their veggie bowl with potatoes, it was really fresh I could tell they use top quality ingredients. Also got to sample the superfood smoothie which was amazing. The cafe has a clean and spacious seating area separate from the grocery area to enjoy a meal. If I lived nearby this would be my go-to place!<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate><user_name>Anna Walton< /user_name>< Gmap_id>

Absolutely superb “fast” food. I ordered delivery from them today... the food came earlier than expected which was a pleasant surprise, but the food! I ordered a Buddha bowl and every component of the dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked. The dish has butternut squash in it... I cannot remember the last time I had perfectly and evenly cooked butternut squash from a fast/non high end restaurant setting, it was excellent. The broccoli and quinoa as well were evenly cooked and tender without being mushy. I did not find one hard grain of quinoa as is usually the case with “fast” restaurants (like True Food for example). Only gripe is the protein portion is on the smaller side, but probably enough for most people. Def check it out if you appreciate good food 👌<//text>

Friendly staff, great customer service. Everything we ordered was tasty and clean. It’s hard to find an “organic” restaurant/cafe that doesn’t add a bunch of unhealthy preservatives in their food. I’m sensitive to nutritional yeast and this place doesn’t add it to enhance taste like what majority of restaurants that serve vegan/vegetarian food do; it’s very clean food. I’m hoping that won’t change as they get busier. Nutritional yeast is an additive/preservative that is very sensitive to the gut. There are other sources for b12.< /Review>

Good, healthy food and groceries.  But a bit pricey.  Some of the market items can be found at CVS right across the street.   A fun, little shop to browse and find many things unavailable elsewhere in the area.</review>

Great market/bakery/cafe concept with a clean, organized and pleasant to eat in environment. I met one of the  owners who was super friendly and informative presenting the variety of organic products, focusing on local quality producers, many vegan options, and care for the Planet, offering big variety of products in bulk, and promoting sustainability. I’m sure I will be going back there soon!< /review>

<Review>I love Target's dollar spot. I think there's something for everyone. You can always find fun stocking stuffers or Easter basket items. Recently they came out with wedding items from bridal gifts to wedding decor, and they are great!< /Review>< userid>

Newly remodeled store. Mask is required at this writing. Store very large and clean, well stocked. I even managed to find disinfecting wipes and lysol spray this morning. Usually has toilet paper, paper towels and hand sanitizer. A small grocery section with fresh produce. Prices a bit on the high end unless on sale. No line this morning. Self check out available< /review>

< Review>
I really enjoy coming here! It is a great place to come when you need things! The kids section has a lot of stuff for all kids. I really like the electronic section with all the phones and everything. The only things I recommend is that the bathrooms need a bit of cleaning and the floor needs to be swept a bit more. Other than that, I really enjoy everything such as the starbucks, pizza hut, and the one dollar section! I really like coming here!</Review>

I ordered an electronic online 8 days ago, and it still hasn’t even reached UPS. They’re site estimates about 1-2 days for this stage but it’s been delayed multiple times. I’ve called guest services but after being declined twice I finally reached them and received no stretch of assistance. I’m fairly certain my package has been lost, so I will definitely be getting a refund. Just waisted 8 days for nothing. Apparently friends and family have had similar problems. Do not shop online at any target. I recommend Best Buy or Walmart for electronics because they’re much more reliable. Shameful service, I feel scammed.<//review>< pictures>

Walked into the entrance of this store today and was immediately hit with the strong smell of URINE. Human, dog, whatever, it was strong and covered a good area. When you have to hold your breath just to get past the checkout stands and first few rows where it isn't that bad, you just want to either get what you came for in a hurry and leave or just turn back altogether. The most common disease you can get from being exposed to something like that is typhoid. Never going there again as your health could depend on it.</text>

Everyone is always helpful and pleasant when you ask a question, the store is clean and except for the construction at present I can always find what I came for and if not someone will willingly tell me where to find it.< /text>

The stores appear to not carry items I desire in store. They’ve reserved floor space for items that I do not want. I do not have success shopping online and therefore am unable to be a customer. I can’t find anything I need even when I try to see their app to navigate.<//text>

< Review>
Target has good products and I love to wander around the store to see what I can pick up that's not on my list. The cashiers are mostly good, but they differ in how they put things in bags, or if they bag everything or not. Sometimes I cringe when I check out because I never know how my items will be bagged or if I have to do it myself, of if they leave certain items out. I like everything bagged.</Review>

<Text>Just did some holiday shopping and it was very hectic! Luckily Deshawn was working the holiday section and definently went above and beyond great customer service for my wife. He was patient and helpful and I understand how stressful it can be working with people during this time of year. I'm so glad this is my neighborhood target!< /Text>< Rating>

The deal was that if you make a purchase over $150 , you will get $50 off if you open a credit account with them. We did so and this resulted in having no discount on the item. She was not clear on the directions of how we would get this $50 off and never mentioned that it would take 20 days. We thought that it would be an instant savings and that wasn't made clear to us. We didn't save anything as I was really disappointed with the quality of service and the workers they hire that can't even do one of their few jobs correctly.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I think Target customer service is superb .. far and away better than WalMart, and better even that stand-alone stores in malls.  The personal are always serving with a smile, the return policies are efficient and without any problems, the cashiers are wonderful … the stock is always orderly and 'in stock' - the stores are clean and draw customers who are discriminating, unlike other similar stores who draw a low-life crowd that throw litter on the floors, etc.  I LOVE TARGET!!!!!!!!!!<//Text>< name>

Normally I'd reverse customer service and try to leave whoever has helped me smiling but today I got "no" two times before I even finished my questions, so no smile for her. Anyways, Target please stock more samsung accessories.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

The compassion and caring of the check out person:  Natalyn.  I had left an item in the cart by mistake and she very sweetly asked if I wanted to purchase that.  I did not see it in the cart and it could have been embarrassing .  However Natalyn put me at ease with a comment about the cart design.< /review>

I waited in the pick up line for 15 minutes, while one staff member waited on six customers in the return line. At the same time, one staff member was putting away merchandise, and another was doing something to the copy machine. I will never place an online advanced order with such terrible service, and being ignored.</Text>

<Text>Not a target I will go to again. The person who helped us was rude and dressed so offensively that I was shocked target and the management team would allow someone to wear sharp objects in their face and on there glasses that can pose a risk to those they are helping. It was not safe and to concerning as she got close to me and my son to clear the register. There is  lots of other jewelry that she can put in her face while working.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

They promise price march but they refused to do this today claiming it's black Friday even though the price I asked them to match was an every day price by Amazon, I will buy the item from Amazon and return the Target item, good luck selling it for more than 3 time the price offered by Amazon.< /Review>

<Time>1406596331879<//Time><review>This was one of my worst experiences ever.
As I got 2 items; I went to the express lane (10 items or less), the cashier (her name is Veronica) was helping  a customer and I was next, suddenly when she is done with that customer she turned and called another customer was waiting on the regular lane asking her to come down!!! She told me that she will take her first, I didn't make any comment.
The next cashier was trying to find a price for an item; she asked Veronica who told her to wait, when Veronica done with that customer; she turned to me saying that she is closed to help the other cashier to find the item price.
I told her that this is rude and not acceptable (I was very embarrassed), but she didn't listen to me and left me alone.
This Target used to be my first stop shop, but not anymore.
I did post this on Target feedback website, but I didn't get any response.

Tracy is hands down the best nail tech around! She always goes above and beyond to ensure I am well taken care of. She is incredibly professional and very patient with me, as I am extremely picky when it comes to my nails. Mindy is also phenomenal, she gives the best pedicures and tends to all my outrageous necessities. Without hesitation I recommend booking an appointment with these two wonderful ladies!</review>

I am here visiting from Michigan, I went in and Nickie and all the staff we’re so friendly. They took all the precautions to be safe. I will most definitely tell my friends and family to go enjoy the experience. I give them a 10. 😉< /text>

They are working outdoors and they’re very clean and nice. I appreciate how quick they took care of me. Great selection of nail polish colors too.< /text>

They're open and doing mani pedis outside! (Now during this 2nd round of closures due to Covid) I was sooo happy they were able to get me in right away when I called. I was there within 15 minutes and only had another customer. They were very careful about sanitization 👌 I enjoyed the chilly breeze while getting my manicure outside 😊< /text>

Holly did a great job. It was my first time going to this place. I haven't had much luck with nail salons so, we'll see how this one goes. The place was clean and they have a lot of nail colors to choose from. A little overwhelming to say the least but great.<//Text>

< Review>
Mostly good experiences here. They are clean- which is most important in my mind. I’m not sure if the quality of gel nails I get depends on the technician or the actual gel brand or color I choose, but sometimes they last a month no problem, and sometimes they start peeling around the edges after a couple of weeks. I usually walk in without an appointment and don’t have to wait long; one time I made an appointment and ended up waiting 20 minutes past my appointment time before they had a chair available for me.</Review>

Vince is the Man. He does a fantastic job with SMS dip powder. Almost 2 weeks ago and my real nails are still flawless.</review>

<review>This place is not professional! They currently discriminated & refused to give services to a woman & her sister just because her sister is disabled in a wheel chair. That is so toxic & disturbing of them I have came here before & never again will I enter a place where they discriminate a human just for being in a wheel chair, I do not recommend this place at all there is far more friendlier places with excellent services.<//review>< pics>

I've tried a good number of nail salons since moving to long beach. The quality in their skill is apparent. The customer service has been great. They are super busy but worth the wait.<//review>

This is a great place, I went with my wife to have her nails done and I had a pedicure.  Such a relaxing hour. I was the only Male in the place ,which seemed strange, but it felt wonderful.
Very friendly staff.< /Text>

<Text>This place is dirty and they don’t sanitize the tools. My mom got a infection on her nail beds coming here. They’re pushy on trying to add more things to charge you more and ignore you or make excuses when you want something fixed. Manager lacks manners and etiquette as well as some of the other nail techs. Save your money and go elsewhere.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

<Text>This is my 2nd time coming here and I can say that this place is awesome.  I had a pedi and mani the 1st time by Lily and she was really good. She took her time providing the service and she was very thorough and meticulous. The foot massage was really nice. I didn't have to make another trip to the reflexology. The manager or rhe owner, Macy, was really nice and she made sure that everything was perfect.  I got the same thing done on the 2nd visit and was even better.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPdPrgdtqwp7QK9_L1X2-S_i8N7ZtSer9i2AXkI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPc-5WP5JHe71-EEl3sFUgXNh3Orku4KN3XakE9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< response>

<Text>Would be 0 starts if that was possible. They have discriminated against a young lady who is wheelchair bound. They were saying it would be unsafe for her to sit in a salon chair because of her inability to walk. They have embarrassed and shamed customers for their disabilities and its disgusting and absolutely unacceptable. I think they need a lesson about the ADA and how to accommodate our fellow members of the community with disabilities. Horrific.<//Text>< pictures>

<rating>4</rating><Review>Let me start off by saying that I have NEVER felt compelled enough to actually share anything negative about business, until today! I have been to L.B Market Nails & Spa dozens of times on my own and have had very pleasant experiences. That is why I was astounded by the way I was treated when I went in with my disabled sister yesterday. We did not receive the usual greeting or hello. After standing there for a while (being stared at like we were aliens), I told them we had appointments at 5pm. They looked at me and said “Oh, just for you, right?” I said no, that we both had appointments. They acted like they had never seen a lady in a wheelchair before in their life! I said she needed pedicure and I needed an SNS manicure. The manager, Lua, walked over and immediately created a scene rudely saying that she didn’t think my sister would be able to get into the spa chair. I politely told her that their pedicure chairs are the same as every other salon we have been to and that it was not a problem. (See photo below at another salon) My sister has been getting pedicures biweekly for years and she sits perfectly fine in them. I then transferred her from her wheelchair into the spa chair with ease as we have always done. Lua stood there and kept arguing that my sister is not safe in their chair. Again, I explained to her that my sister is completely safe. I explained that her disability does not affect her brain. I educated her that cerebral palsy affects her body only and she is not going to throw herself out of the chair. I reassured her that she can understand everything we are saying even though she can not verbalize it. Lua said I would need to sit next to her the whole time because they didn’t have a seatbelt. I said she didn’t need a seatbelt because it’s not a moving wheelchair but I had no problem sitting next to her while she got her pedicure and I got my nails done in the seat next to her. Lua said I would need to wait until her pedicure was over before I could get my nails done because she was not safe. I told her that was ridiculous. We should be able to have our services at the same time as we always do. I told her we would be late for our dinner plans if we had to do one of us at a time. That is why we made appointments for both of us at 5.  At this point, Lua had made us feel embarrassed and totally unwelcome. I explained that we did not appreciate the harassment or discrimination. I asked Lua if she knew anything about ADA. She said she did but I argued that if that were true then she would not be so blatantly disrespectIng our rights. It is my sister’s right to determine if she feels safe, not Lua’s. She refused to have our services done concurrently even if I sat in a chair beside her. I explained over and over how many different salons we have been to over the years (my sis is 46 and I’m 40) and how we have never had a problem or been treated so poorly but she would not budge. This treatment went on for over 10 minutes despite the fact that my sister had been sitting comfortably in their chair the whole time. I looked around and one young woman customer quietly shrugged and mouthed ‘I’m sorry’. We ended up leaving in tears for the embarrassment my sister had endured. I NEVER want another disabled person to be treated the way we were in this salon ever again. Being a flight attendant and in the service industry myself I’m appalled that something like this is happening in 2020. Flight attendants are great about spreading the word and I personally know hundreds of colleagues in the area. I’m going to tell our story and then have them share our story. I 100% believe in boycotting. We are friends with business owners in Long Beach and I’m sure they are going to want to know what’s going on in their community so they can help end this kind of injustice! Long Beach, Calif.< /Review>< pictures>

Today was my first visit to this nail salon, and I’ll definitely be going back. Holly gave me a great pedi, and everyone was very friendly and accommodating. If you go, enter thru the back of the shopping center (by Trader Joe’s), due to construction.</text>

This is a lifestyle shopping center experience. There are probably 50 highend shops here. It is designed so shoppers can park close to the place they're  visiting. It is anchored by Trader Joe's, BevMo, national chain restaurants and an art house movie theater. I go to Sanctuary Skin Care and Day Spa. The Nectar Juice Bar and Trader Joe's regularly. It's very convenient.<//text>

<text>My Girlfriend had a bad experience here.

<Review>Todd was quick and thorough. I needed a bike assembled and he got it to me in a few hours when other shops around were saying a few days. His pricing was the same as all the other shops. Highly recommend.</Review>< GmapID>

CA is seriously better than awesome. I can't get enough of this store. Almost everything sold is at a discount. Every single staff member is incredibly helpful and can I just say how fantastic Pedro is? He's incredibly helpful and I can't thank him enough for assisting in my search for a tri bike and helmet!</text>

He then made sure to give me a call when he was there and gave me some options to fix my tube and offered another innertube type that did fit my bike.

He was easy to work with and fun to chat with. Would recommend this place.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Rented a pair of bikes from Todd, he was very kind and informative about where to ride. Also asked him to assemble my bike as I had just moved and it was in a box. Dropped it off on Sunday in pieces and picked it up Monday put together and running smooth.< /text>

<Review>I called to rent a bike for the week and they quoted me $100 for each bike. The pricing on their website says $60 for a week. They said due to COVID they don’t have a lot of bikes left. So you are going to almost charge double?! You need to update your prices on your website or honor the prices you have on your site. It says this is the friendliest bike shop in the area- not if you are going to rip people off and try to price gouge then.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>The bike I rented here was in perfect shape mechanically, with brakes and shifters properly adjusted, and I got a good suggestion on a route. I often rent bikes when I travel and I often find rental bikes are not well maintained, so I really appreciated getting a bike that was in good shape, especially going up and down the steeper hills in that area.</text>< Date>

Brilliant service, going above and beyond. I was visiting La Jolla for a few days and they dropped my bike off at the hotel and collected it after. Good hybrid bike, not electric. There are plenty of hills but electric is cheating in my book.</Text>

<review>We bought an electric bike there last week so I can commute to work with the hills and a 10 mile ride each way... the bike is soo much fun and my commute is awesome. Bye, bye gas prices and hello doing good for the world and me. My kids think its great too. Top Jolt Cycle was great. Great customer service and working with us and a good deal on the bike! P.S.They also rent scooters/ moped there! I think the only place in San Diego. Thanks so much Top Jolt for making it happen!</review>< Pics>

< Review>
I went for a weekly rental on a hybrid. The bike I received was patently unsafe and in terrible condition. The rear wheel was severely warped. The tires were underinflated. Both brakes were so soft that stopping quickly was impossible (the warped rear wheel makes functioning brakes impossible). The derailleur was not functioning properly, gears did not stay in place and would rattle loudly. The entire drive train looked like it hadn't been lubricated in a year.
This was the only hybrid they had in my size, so I went and found a much better hybrid at another shop for only a few extra dollars. I returned the bike after a few hours on the first day. Out of a $72 rental, I received only a $33 refund. I wouldn't mind a nominal fee, but charging me nearly $40 for an unsafe bike is terrible business practice.<//Review>

I'm from out of town and wanted to ride the Dog Beach/San Diego River area. Top Jolt is in the epicenter of OB and had expert advice and service. I will be a repeat customer. I'm a guy that hadn't ridden a bike for 20+ years so I found a comfortable cruiser and had at it. Perfect day!<//Review>

Prices were good. Had the electric bikes for 24 hours and rode around San Diego. My husband and I had a blast. Definitely recommend as we didn't have to pay for parking where went. Todd was great to work with and it was easy to get the bikes.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Very good service! The bikes are in good condition, the brakes and gears work great. Rental is a bit more expensive than other places in San Diego, but it was closest to our location. $ 10 / hour

(Original)
Très bon service! Les vélos sont en bon état, les freins et les vitesses fonctionnent très bien. La location est un peu plus chère que d’autres endroits à San Diego, mais c’etait le plus près de notre emplacement. 10$/heure<//text>

<Text>Love these guys! I bought a bike on layaway, and while there were some hangups that were clearly out of their control, Austin was constantly in contact with me on statuses and news. When the bike finally came (earlier than expected!), they were extremely helpful in getting the bike set up for me and ready to ride. Any questions I had, they were excited to answer and chat about, and if they didn't know, they were great about finding out. I have been back many times for other things and will continue to return because they're easy to work with and just friendly to talk shop!< /Text><userid>105527933668156859907< /userid>< pictures>

Services, both sales and repair, are done by a friendly, knowledgeable staff.  They're the main reason I choose Kearny Mesa Trek as my local bike shop.
I can't be 100% happy without having a shop as good as Trek Kearny Mesa always there to help keep me pedaling.  Even more so living a car free lifestyle.

Axel has worked on my bike a number of times and has always been beyond helpful (and very patient, thankfully), going out of his way to make tight turnarounds and provide alternative solutions when parts are scarce. When I popped a spoke right before a big ride I'd been looking forward to, we chatted about a variety of solutions (spokes are seemingly impossible to get during covid) and he ultimately got me back on the bike with time to spare. Todd is also great to chat with and has provided great guidance on training, repairs, routes and more. Really everybody I've spoken with there has been beyond helpful and friendly, despite the fact that they're always swamped with repairs and customers (as they should be). Just how a shop should be run.<//review>< Pics>

< review>
Last year, my wife and I were thinking about getting back into cycling. We visited the Trek Superstore in San Diego. The Trek sales team were extraordinary in asking questions to determine our abilities and recommend the right bikes for us. A year later, thanks to having the right bikes under us, we are both avid cyclists again. Now, let’s talk service... being avid cyclist and not mechanics, our bikes are serviced at the San Diego Trek Superstore. The staff is always helpful and courteous. The mechanic/ technicians are experts, providing quick turnaround and are also willing to explain the situation and even demonstrate how to make minor adjustments on my own. My advice, visit the San Diego Trek Superstore and check them out for yourself... you won’t be disappointed< /review>

<text>Top notch attention to detail product placement, showroom layout, and customer satisfaction.  Todd Erickson and his team is AWESOME!  He showed me the best fitting road cycling shoes I've ever owned. He made sure I took the time to try two different sizes on several times each to really pin down the right choice.  I came near closing time and I never felt rushed.  He offered as much help as I needed while giving the best advice on the products.  The products I purchased are awesome.I grew up in sales and customer service and Todd is a model leader.  You can tell he has the best interest of the Trek family as well as the consumers.I am a returning customer from purchasing a Trek Madone back in 2007.  Every visit was a pleasure then and it's no different now.This exemplary customer service is a pattern and I am extremely happy to refer friends and family.  Trek Superstore debunks the myths about corporate run bike shops.<//text>< name>

<Text>So, back at the beginning of February I ordered in layaway 2 bikes xxl frame, a black and an orange one.
The black was supposed to arrive on 4/5 and the orange on 5/17.
At the beginning of April I did not receive any call or mail to let me know the status. Around mid April I called in to find out that the black  arrived right on 4/5 and that it was not assembled yet. I asked if the orange would arrive on 5/17 as expected and they told me it looked on time. I am coming from LA so I would want to go there only once. Around the 8th of May I get a call with an update. The orange one was now showing to be shipped a little later on 5/23 so they told me that it would be ready around the 30th for pick up. I called today 6/1 to check if the orange has arrived as anticipated, considering that when the black one arrived nobody cared to let me know. I find out not only that the orange now turned into red (my least favorite color) but also that they sold the black one to someone else.
What was the point of giving them the required deposit back in February to hold 2 bikes for me?? Now there is not even 1 out of 2 and the next available is apparently in 2023....
The manager guaranteed me that "he will find a solutuon that would make me happy". Now I am confidently waiting for this good resolution and hoping to change this review with a positive one.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>{'time': 1622655783643, 'text': 'Hi Paolo, thank you for your time letting us know about your frustrating experience in our shop!

Find everything you are looking for at the San Diego Trek Bicycle Superstore. The store’s staff is very professional and there is a family-friendly feeling you get when talking with sales and service staffers. I have been cycling daily for more than 50 years and have spend a fair amount of time interacting with bike shop folks. This Trek Superstore is the best of the bunch. Sales rep, Austin, is outstanding and it was a real pleasure buying a new bike from him. Additionally, I found the entire sales team to be very helpful in answering my questions. The service team is a highly knowledgeable group of expert bike mechanics. I wholeheartedly endorse this place. You can’t go wrong shopping at the Trek Bicycle Superstore.< /text>

Went to look for a road bike. They had maybe road 5 bikes in total. No one greeted or acknowledged, left after 10 minutes. Seems like more of a service shop than a bike shop.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I'm stationed overseas, and it's often difficult to find the parts locally, that I need to maintain or upgrade my bike.  That's when I discovered Trek Bicycle Superstore.  Support has been outstanding!  They've been ordering the parts from the warehouse, repackaging as needed, and shipping out to me via USPS Priority mail.  I'm informed when the parts ship, and given a tracking number.  Better yet, they don't skimp on packaging.  So often, I receive items that have been tossed around, because they weren't packaged well.  Definitely not the case here!  First rate all the way, I could not be more pleased!</Review>< pics>

When my local bike store in AZ, was out of the Bontrager XR1 tire, I looked online and located an XR1 Team Issue tire, from this site.  I ordered it on a weekend and noticed it shipped almost immediately.  The shipping cost was free and the tire arrived a couple days later, via the United States Postal Service.  The tire came in a big enough box, so it was not squished inside.  I had the tire installed that evening and after riding on it, I can say it is the best tire, I've had so far, on my Trek Marlin 7.  I highly recommend purchasing from the Trek Bicycle Superstore, they provided excellent customer service with a high quality product.</review>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>While the gear is great, as is the case with most successful enterprises it is the people that make the difference.  For customer retention, at least for me, a few dollars here or there are not deal breakers/makers, but when that is combined with competent, patient and personable individuals that is going to instill confidence and loyalty.< /Review></record>

Hello, The staff at the Kearney Trek store is excellent. Their customer service, service center is top. Special thanks to Austin, Susan, Tim, and the rest of the staff. I have purchased my Domane road bike and Cannondale mountain bike at this location and continue to do my business there. Again, thank you for the top quality customer service.</review>

I was going through my garage and found a 10 year old Trek, tires were in bad shape, and I hadn't changed a bike tire since I had my Schwinn Stingray in the 60's,  So I took the front tire in to the store picked up what I needed.  The staff was very helpful, and respectful, I will return again.  Covid standards were in place and enforced thanks for keeping this Old White Male safe.< /review>

Very delighted with my new Trek Domane Al 4 disc. I had purchased the AL 3 Disc 2021  and after riding it for a couple of weeks decided to try out one model higher due to concerns about shifting. The AL  for was significantly smoother and I decided to trade up. Very pleased that I did. I have ridden my bike about 50 miles so far and I could not be happier with a performance, fit, shifting, the overall ride, and the breaking. I’m 62 and will be riding for recreational enjoyment several times weekly for up to 30 miles per ride. This bike was a wonderful retirement gift to self!< /Text>

Even with the Pandemic situatiom putting new rules and regulations to all these businesses to protect their customers....This Trek store was able to keep high quality customer services with a down to earth smile. Special kudos goes to the staff, especially Nate. Even with the understandable low stock (back orders) of items I wanted, he never gave up showing me other options that were equivalent or better than I wanted. Thank You Trek and Thank You Nate<//review>

Great experience top to bottom. The interface and experience was everything you'd expect from a modern tech company (easy, efficient, etc) but if you need to reach out to them for a specific issue, they attend to you like your local bike shop. Highly recommend.</Review>

We arrived in San Diego and proceeded directly to Canyon Bike showroom in Carlsbad to try out the bikes. To cut the story short, the bikes were good, but the service is not. We felt unwanted on that showroom.

Our trip agenda took us to Trek superstore yesterday and we were attended by Austin, who was EXTREMELY HELPFUL and went above and beyond. While we were waiting for our mountain bike rentals. He was very accommodating, he even offered to have us try a E-bike knowing that we have never tried one. To cut the story short, we were happy with the bikes that we tried and rented and are happier with the service.

We will definitely go with Trek versus Canyon given the service that we got. Thank you Austin!< /text>

<review>Horrible. Nothing else to say. Online sales a joke. They give wrong tracking info. Package week late and you get different stories from everybody. But they sure do charge and clear your card quickly.</review>< Response>

The woman kept saying it’s only going to be a few minutes.  When I finally got to the service desk, they told me it would be at least three weeks before they could get to my bike but I could make an appointment to drop off.  Why on earth is that not possible out front.  It would be less exposure and less waiting.

Also, by limiting their hours they just have more people hanging out waiting for longer.  Kinda counter intuitive.

Bernie’s Bikes in OB had a week delay, but I was able to make an appointment within five minutes and the tune up is cheaper.< /text>< Pictures>

They actually stock what they show as available. I know that’s a low bar but in 2020 that earns a 5’er. Good communication and timely shipping as well. I will keep them in mind for future purchases.< /Text>

<text>Very bad customer service.  Lacking help to customers and very slow working staff. They need to set up a better waiting system rather then staff just coming and picking who to help next.  no name or numbers being used. There are many other places to shop at, I was about to purchase 2 bikes today, oh well. Better luck next time.</text><user_id>106398350992764204622< /user_id><date>1595281395826</date><Rating>2</Rating>< name>

Ok to be honest, my trek products are always great, service has always been good,  the thing that really made me happy is the packaging it came in. Wrapped and very personal.  Honestly this little extra touch made them stand out from every other quality bike products.  It felt like somebody out there in virtual land really cared about me.</review>

Okay, so you can find almost anything sold online or at another store for cheaper.  But 99% of those other places will not have near the customer service that Trek Bicycle Superstore offers.  That generic, recorded message that you get when you have a question about or problem with your purchase will not be the knowledgeable, helpful, friendly staff at Trek Bicycle Superstore .  Nor will that electronic voice offer to take back any item for a full refund, no questions asked.< /Text>

I went to the Trek store in San Diego during COVID-19 where they had a skeleton crew working tremendously hard to safely and expeditiously meet the massive demand of people anxious to get on bikes during quarantine. I being one of them. I was greeted by Angel, who helped me from A-Z in finding the right road bike (fit, function, price, etc). I am extremely satisfied with my bike but even more grateful for my experience with Trek and Angel who prioritized my safety and found me the perfect road bike!! Thank Angel and all those at Trek who have made this COVID-19 pandemic a little easier to get through!< /Review>

I prefer to shop at a local bike shop but I saw a deal too good to pass up. I ordered the bike. Turns out the bike was oversold. They hooked me up with an upgrade at the same price. In the end I got an even better deal.< /Text>

Bought Shimano MTB shoes online.  Looks like they had been used briefly and restocked as they had cleat install marks on bottom and the rubber bottom had obviously been on pavement.  Should have been inspected better before shipment and sale as a “new” shoe.  Waiting for response from store.  Update, they have allowed me to return the shoes, and were very nice and also apologetic about the issues.< /Text>

Easy to order and purchase.  Received my paddles very quickly for regular shipping.  It took only minutes to install. The barefoot paddles are comfortable and much better quality than the factory originals.</Text>

<Text>Surprised. Surprised..
I did buy my bike accessories from the store (twice). One of the item I purchase (Shimano Saint Pedals) was defective. I did reach out to Shimano for warranty replacement and they directed me back to the store where I purchased the set from originally.  It was impossible for me to reach customer service representative for weeks. Finally I send an email and I got a reply from them. In my email I suggested to buy a new set and send the defective one for refund as the process of initiating a warranty claim will take weeks if not months meanwhile I have no bike to ride. I was hoping that the store will understand and provide help, instead they refused and insisted that I return the pedals back for a warranty replacement. It was not feasible to send it back as I have to pay for the shipping myself and wait God knows how long to receive the replacement.
I contacted other bike shop near by whom I did not had any prior business transaction with and the were more than willing to process the warranty claim for me, Still have to wait for the claim process to go through. I was quite convinced that those other bike shops would have exchanged the defective pedals with a new one and took care of the claim after had I bought the pedals from them at  first. Most bike shops are very customer oriented and know how important for a rider to have his bike except this store that made things very difficult for me . My advise is for everyone thinking about buying items for their bikes is to stick to your neighborly bike shop as they will help you get back on the road when needed without the bureaucracy of dealing with a (SUPERSTORE) that will do nothing to for you.</Text><gmap_id>0x80dbff5b82293051:0xa2fe2a1251f80555<//gmap_id><Date>1588599279328</Date>< response>

Wow!   Superfast shipping from CA to FL...I was prepared to wait a week because of the notice that shipping may be slower due to COVID but was pleasantly surprised to get them In just a couple of days.   And, the Bontrager shoes I ordered are great, too!<//Review>

Only store I know of that gives great discounts and free shipping! They also ship fast after placing the order, only took about 2 days to ship it out the door! Can’t wait to get the new bike rack assembled and installed on my car!! It’s going to allow me to go to so many more mountain bike trails in Florida and maybe even further up north!!<//Text>

I found your website to have the most competitive prices for what i was looking for. I was a bit suspicious as i had not heard of you before searching on google shopping. However, I was pleasantly surprised! The best part about it was the customer service i received. I initially paid with PayPal but my payment did not go through due to an issue with PayPal. I was contacted within 10 minutes by your team via email; I really appreciated this as I needed the items quickly. I resolved the issue and received my items when promised. Great doing business with y'all!< /text>

People say customer service is dead? Not at San Diego Trek! Mike, Mike and Mike W. are stellar! Couldn't ask for a better bike shop to frequent. The product is great too. Love my Trek Fuel EX7 29er!< /Text>

My spouse and I have two nearly 30-year old Specialized MTBs. We decided to fix them up to help us exercise. We found Trek Bicycle Superstore's selection, prices and attention to detail just remarkable. We were able to get our bikes up and running with new Shimano cranksets, derailleurs and shifters, all perfectly matched. One cannot ignore the age of the bikes, but Trek allowed us to breathe new life into them!< /review>

Exceptional service... when you find great service like this, you should support them with your business, as when you need this quality service because of an issue that might come up, you will be glad you did.  In my case, I was sent the wrong item.  Instead of returning the item, it was about $20, they told me to keep it as it cost almost as much to return it, and then they sent the correct item in two days at no cost to me.  They quickly responded to my issue via email, within a day it was resolved.< /Text>

I went into the store with the aim to buy a cheap commuter bike for $450, ended up leaving the store with a $5,000 E-bike which has been the BEST decision of my life!! These guys really know what they’re doing! Loved every bit of the experience thank you Trek!< /Review>

Great selection of high quality, well-known products you are probably looking for. In my case, I stumbled on a discount of more than 50% off one of the top 3 best-rated road helmets, after scouring the internet for deals for quite a while. Fantastic!

I took the 'free shipping' option (US Postal Service), which came with the caveat to allow 2 business days on sale items before they ship. Imagine how pleased I was to receive an email that the shipment process had been started that Saturday afternoon, and then to find it on my front porch Monday afternoon!  YMMV, but I'm pleased.< /review>

<name>Conrad Boyle</name><Text>In the Summer of 2014 I purchased a Trek 8.4 DS bicycle. In the summer of 2019, just five years later, the plastic knob that locks/unlocks the suspension broke and no longer functioned. I was simply looking to replace this part for my less than five year old bike at the time that I have had garaged since I bought it. I took it to the Nearest Trek store and after having my bicycle for several days offered no resolution. I then contacted the corporate customer service department and spoke to Luke Borland who initially seemed like he wanted to help, but informed me that they do not stock replacement parts like the one I was looking for. The resolution offered to me was a new fork at a "discounted price" plus cost of labor. My bike and fork are blue, the colors they offered me were white and black. The fork they offered me would've cost approximately $150.00 and it wouldn't even match my fork. All i want is a lockout knob for my fork, and think it is unreasonable and unfair that a bike that I paid over $800.00 has completely degraded it's functionality. Even the Trek store in Bonita, CA that I brought it to initially told me that the bike I purchased is a "lower end bike" and I couldn't agree more at this point.  I think it is completely irresponsible of Trek to sell bikes and not offer replacement parts just five years later.</Text><user>112473639858993970902< /user></record></dataset><record>

Make sure your online order is right, because there is no online cancel option, granted they ship incredibly fast.  Disclaimer: i placed my order during the COVID pandemic, so i had some issues that took several weeks to resolve,  luckily Nate would follow up with me, and was super professional and forth right, cause I was at my wits end as no one from there returns department was responding, they were still adjusting to COVID, Anyways, Nate was awesome, and the reason why I will give this store another chance post pandemic :)<//text>

I wanted to order some replacement grips for a late model Trek bike.  I did not see the original grips on the website, but there was a generally similar set.  I put in the instructions something along the lines of "don't ship these unless they will fit a 2018 FX3".  I received an email prior to shipping from John, the online sales manager.  He indicated that these grips would work out fine, but in the event they did not, I could contact him and get them shipped back with no hassle.  He was right, too.  The grips were perfect for my bike.  This was a really great customer service experience and I expect to order from them again.  Thanks, John!</text>

<text>I bought some tube replacement inserts on Amazon to solve the dreaded flat tire issues with our electric conversion mountain bikes. Through trial and frustration, I found that there was only one tire that actually worked with the inserts very well; It was the Bontrager Trail Connection in a 26 x 2.00 size.
I normally don't purchase directly from a bike store but this time Google directed me to the Trek store so I decided to check the prices. I was amazed to find that the tires were on sale, competitively priced, and that I could get an additional 10% off. I decided to go for it and order four of them.

I placed my order on Friday and to my amazement, the UPS truck showed up with the shipment THE NEXT MORNING!

Trek has definitely won me over with this purchase and I intend to ALWAYS check their store out first, when buying anything for a bike.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<time>1534830914549< /time><review>I  was looking for an electric bike about a month ago.  Found one at a local bike shop, a demo, at a good price.  My neighbor said I should check out Trek before buying locally.  She told me she bought a bike there before and the service was great.  So, I went over and found a nice demo there.  I rode it for about three weeks and decided I would rather have a different model.  Consistent with their 30 day exchange policy, Angel, the store manager, took back my bike at full price and sold me another bike at a large discount.  All the sales people are very nice and the service guys are great.  They could not have been more accommodating.  And, I really like my new bike.  I could not be more pleased with the service and product.<//review>< Pics>

Everything regarding my buying experience was awesome! - from Daniel helping me in picking up the bike for me, giving me all those pointers and recommendations with his excellent attitude and customer service, all his excellent service was key in making my decision.

The day I picked up my bike, Nate was there and helped me through the process of understanding all there is about my new bike and even gave me some training on how to use some of the features. The two mechanics that I feel bad for not remembering their names were also superb! I know I have a closer trek store to me but I'm just going to make the Kearny Mesa store, my home store for new purchases and for maintenance. Please, keep doing such great work! And for the management, give these guys some extra days off or why not, a raise!!!< /Review>

In these "difficult" times you guys were great on prices, but more importantly delivery times.  Getting ready go back on-line and look at your tire repair kits and various inflators.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Great experience here. Rented a bike for a week and the whole process was efficient and pleasant as a rental should be. Employees were very communicative leading up to the rental period and very friendly at pickup and drop-off. Huge thanks to Angel, Austin, and the rest of the team. Keep up the great work.< /Text><Time>1551201643902< /Time><Name>Ry Ward</Name><user>111730189215575152669<//user><Gmap_id>0x80dbff5b82293051:0xa2fe2a1251f80555< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

<Name>Robin Wilson<//Name><Review>I’m sharing my experience with those of you who may be on the fence deciding on a Trek bicycle.
I purchased a used Trek Bike that I have ridden for at least 5 years.  I have been very happy with my used bike, but wanted to update to a newer model to keep up with the friends I ride with...

I absolutely love my new bike!!  I’m not exaggerating, I love the gearing, the comfort, the tires, even the seat feels great.  Thank you to the sales people at Trek!!</Review>< resp>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I rate this company/store with 5 stars as they continue to earn it.  I ordered a Project One, custom 2019 Madone SLR 7 in viper red and white - a beautiful bike!   It arrived from the factory with a damaged head tube.  My sales rep Matt Shibel and the store manager Angel Amaya both worked with me to work out a more than acceptable solution. The bike was returned to the factory for repair and repainting. As compensation for the delay and inconvenience they comped me a new Wavecel helmet, retail $299!  While fitting the bike Dan determined that in order to accommodate my desired saddle to handlebar reach a different seat post was necessary. This was ordered and installed today at no cost. This team of people have gone out of their way to satisfy this loyal customer.  They care about your level of satisfaction and go out of their way to assure it. I can’t recommend them or the Trek brand enough!<//Review>< pics>

<review>You guys are just amazing. I needed a helmet for my dad’s birthday and I asked if it would arrive on time. Keep in mind I ordered the helmet on Tuesday afternoon and needed it by Saturday and I didn’t want to pay for expedited shipping. Well guess what! The helmet arrived the NEXT DAY. While I know that’s not typical, I did live chat with someone and he said it’s in stock in CA not far from me so it would probably get there before Saturday... but the next day? You guys are so on top of it, I’ll definitely be ordering from you again. Amazing customer service, super fast shipping, very professional! Thank you thank you thank you!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

<review>Mike T in the service area is amazing.  He has been my personal mechanic since 2014.  I have dealt with lots of other local bike shops, but the service team at Trek Superstore is what makes all the difference.  San Diego has the best local shops, but Trek-San Diego is spoiled to have some of the best mechanics!  In regards to sales, nobody beats MARCO!  Nobody.  You cannot get a more personal and professional bike sales rep.  I trust him with every aspect of my bike, cycling and racing ambitions.  I have trusted this team since 2014!< /review>< Rating>

I came in because I had attempted to replace the tube in my front tire and it wasn't holding air.  The guy at the service counter inspected the rim and tire interior to make sure there were no issues, and then installed a new tube for me.  The whole process took only about 10 minutes.<//Text>

I did not know this website existed. My local bike shop and the Trek website did not have the new WaveCel helmet that I wanted in my size and color. Trek Bicycle Superstore Online did. Hidden secret. Excellent.< /Review>

My Flare RT tail light was shipped very quickly.  Although it is an expensive light it did not come with a seat clip. When I called the online manager he had an extra one and agreed to ship it to me free of charge. Very good customer service in my opinion.< /Text>

<review>I wanted to share my experience with this company, they were out of a product that I had ordered, it was an inventory issue, John called me explained the problem and worked hard to resolve the issue. John offered a comparable product. This evening I received an email from John saying that I had ordered the last two lights of the model I wanted, one of the boxes was damaged and instead of sending it he had substituted a newer light. I wholeheartedly recommend this company, they have GREAT Customer support.

<review>Excellent customer service!. Tyler who helped us was very knowledgable about bikes and so patient on explaining use and handling as this was the first time we bought bikes. We were there practically the whole day deciding, trying, and being fitted. Tyler hooked us up, even building a bike they didn't have already out in less than an hour. We ended up coming out totally satisfied and with so much knowledge on our two new Trek bikes. Would definitely work with Trek again and recommend this place to anybody who wants professional service.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
I ordered a pair of cycling shorts and received them promptly, however the wrong size had been pulled at the warehouse.  I contacted the company by email and explained what happened, and the error was quickly fixed.  I received the correct size, and a prepaid shipping label to return the wrong ones.  I'm delighted with the customer service, and would recommend Trek Bicycle Superstore.</Review>

<Review>BE CAREFUL buying here. Do your research on this place. As another reviewer said, "nice people, terrible service." This about sums it up. The people are all very nice and make you feel welcome. The actual service (so far) has been awful.

Why? They sold me a bike with a poorly chosen/installed component that broke and damaged the fork, then chose to take zero responsibility for it and essentially told me it wasn't their fault (I had owned it for a week and rode it only 7 miles, 6.9 of which were after the damage occurred). They then told me that don't accept returns (even if the reason for the return was their fault, like in my case) and told me my options were to exchange it for a more expensive bike (how convenient) or go buy nail polish and paint it myself. And I had paid them for the Velocare bike insurance, too. I mean, are you kidding me? Take responsibility for your store and your inventory, Trek. I made the mistake of trusting them, and it might've landed me in a potentially very costly long-term situation. I hope I'm an outlier and that they are otherwise accommodating, but who knows. Fingers crossed for better customer service in the future.

All that said, do your research before buying. Also, when you're in the shop, make sure the bike they're selling you is put together correctly. Dealing with them will be a nightmare if not.

UPDATE: while Angel's response sounds nice, he wasn't helpful at all when I visited the store after this happened. Even when I pointed out the exact same flaw on other bikes they had yet to sell (which he literally fixed right in front of me), he did nothing to remedy the problem I had. Actions speak louder than words.<//Review>< Pictures>

The OEM parts you need at the prices you should not have to pay. Shipping was $9.00 for a $17.00 part the size of a quarter. I could not get this part at the local Trek dealer so I was forced to buy online.</Text>

I had been to several other Trek stores in the past few days as I was searching for a new bike and this is where I met Angel who suggested a bike no other sales person had and he really hit it one the button. I also want to add the bike fit he gave me was right on. I want to add here that most of this shopping and fitting was after the store had closed. Excellence costumer service. I had a 60 mile ride the next day and as bad as I tried to find something I wasn't happy about my new bike, I failed miserably.  I love my bike!</Text>< Pics>

My Bontrager LIne Pro 40 TLR 29 Boost carbon wheelset was my very first order from Trek Superstore - San Diego, but I am extremely pleased with product availability, price out the door, and quickness of shipment. I even had a great phone conversation with a very knowledgeable bicycle technician. Ordered Monday and received today in perfect condition. Can't wait to get them on my 2018 Trek Stache 7 and shred the trails. I wish I lived in San Diego and could stop in frequently. St. Louis is pretty far away. Thank you for being great!</text>

We dropped in to this Trek Superstore to ask for help concerning a missing lock core on our rack, and to pick up some accessories and cleaning supplies that got left behind in the move.

Austin was beyond helpful and incredibly kind. He looked up our bike rack purchase (from a different Trek Superstore in another state), called Yakima for us, and got them to send the replacement pieces to the store. Austin answered all of our many questions! He also did a quick safety check on my husband's bike, including tightening bolts and lubricating the chain and spokes. Even though we're not living in the San Diego area, we'll definitely be back to this store while we're in southern California.

Thanks, Austin, and the rest of the Trek Superstore team!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

<text>Shout out to the team at Trek Bicycle Shop in Kearny Mesa.  I received a Pro torque wrench from Santa this year; needless to say the staff showed Santa how to use the wrench (display model) and recommended that I come in anytime I had questions about how to use it.  Customer since 2013, purchased a bike from them and various parts.  Thanks for being a great shop!<//text>< time>

Disappointed. I only went there to buy a couple of jackets. I noticed the jackets on line and checked store availability. Drop box said in store San Diego only. I figured road trip from Temecula. Issue is even though the jackets were there they were in boxes in the back. They were only meant for online purchase. Again that's even though in the drop online it said IN STORE. I showed the sales person the add and he agreed that the web needs fixed. He then showed me a diferent part of the Web page that said online only. Either way with the jackets in back in boxes he couldn't sell them to me with out me ordering online and then me paying shipping?  I guess you can't do in store pick up there.< /Text>

Nice bikes, but everyone I have worked with in the store are horrible with customer service.

Did a 3 day rental for 2 roadbikes and the tire on one got cut with glass, so it wasn't rideable. Brought the bikes in early to potentially get an early return or another tire. They werent willing to help me out with either.

I bought my bike at the shop and everytime i go in I dont feel like im treated very well. I'm a fan of the trek emonda I bought, but my suggestion is buy your bike at another store!< /Review>

The worst customer service I have ever  experienced. I was very interested in the Madone, but turned off so badly by their team of sales associate that I went with  Cannondale instead. After a terrible accident on my 6 month old bike, I had to find another. Figured I should give trek another shot considering how fond I was of the Madone. The chance to be able to create my own bike utilizing their bike fit machine made me feel like a school girl. Unfortunately, I was given the absolute worst customer service I have ever received. Ignored by each and every single person. I received more assistance from a pamphlet. It's nice to know Trek allows, if not promote, associates to behave in such a manner where as perspective customers are turned off to even have the desire to own a single product offered by their company.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I dont need to to to bike stores for parts because I am in the industry and do my own wrenching so dont need a mechanic either. However recently I snapped a drive side spoke on my road bike and didnt have the correct spoke.   I called up and they had the spoke... I brought my wheel just in case...fully expecting I was going to go back home and do it myself...it was busy Saturday morning... the guy took the wheel and went in the back - 10min later returned with it laced up and ready to go!   I was blown away.
I own my own company so I am very critical of customer relations with people I do business with and this shop was THE most professional bike shop I have ever stepped foot in...period.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

The fitting went superbly.  After the fitting, Stefan worked with me for the next couple of hours and set up several bikes for me to tryout.  I settled on the Cannondale Supersix EVO with Ultegra DI2.  All I can say is the final fit was fantastic and the bike set up is wonderful.  I highly recommend this store and the clientele.  It was a very good experience with no hassle.<//text>< Pictures>
