<Review>First Class operation being run by the San Marcos Grand Avenue Caliber Collision shop.  Evan, Tiffany & Gina provided exceptional customer service.  Everyone in the body shop did a fantastic job repairing the damage to my vehicle.  All boxes checked for this outfit, including my vehicle being repaired on time as promised.  I definitely recommend them!< /Review>< Date>

Caliber Collision was thorough. From Gina in the front to Devin who handled my claim and repairs. Gina is wonderful, she is professional and has amazing customer service. Devin kept in constant contact with me in regards to my vehicle. He was always helpful when I had any questions. Devin made the process for me very easy! He went above and beyond! My car looks amazing! I would recommend them over and over again. You won't be disappointed.<//text>

Evan went above and beyond through the entire process. He kept me informed throughout and was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Everything was a breeze and I felt very taken care of as a customer. I will definitely recommend Caliber not only for their impeccable work but for the amazing customer service I received from Evan!</Review>< Pics>

I was in a fender bender and my insurance referred me to take my car in for repairs and I was really impressed with the service I received from Tommy at caliber. I was kept informed throughout the process of repairs and my car looked as if nothing ever happened. I definitely recommend this establishment and will definitely come back if anything happens again! Tommy was the best!<//Review>

So my husband is considered a crash car dummy because we are constantly having to take our car in for repairs. I get so upset and frustrated having to deal with insurance and rentals, but when I walk in Caliber Collision and are met by their wonderful staff, my anxiousness disappears. One of the staff clerks, Gina is so patient and kind, she walked me through everything which was awesome! Thank you Caliber for your outstanding service. I will definitely be recommending your facility.</Text>

I dealt with Evan at Caliber COLLISION in San Marcos,  Ca.Evan was professional and dedicated to completing the work on my car. Evan stayed in touch with me  giving me updates of the progress of the completion of my vehicle.When necessary,  Evan contacted the insurance company to make sure that financial responsibility was being taken care of, and the necessary care for completing the work was being addressed.
I would recommend Caliber COLLISION, San Marco's  Ca.for your cars needs.Ask for Evan.</text>

Dealing with the workings of cars is not what I am familiar with.  The staff was very professional but because the cost of the repairs the insurance totaled the car.  I had a friend, who knows cars, look at the car and said it was not that bad.  I had it removed and repaired by anothe place for half of what Caliber would have charged.  Also, some car parts were removed and not sent with the car, which does not seem right.< /text>

Excellent Customer Service and repair work!!  Stephanie at the front desk was very professional and made it easy to understand the insurance and the work contract.  But my 5 stars really goes to Michael and his repair team.  From the beginning Michael went above and beyond for me.  He spent a lot of time accessing the damage to my vehicle, explaining the process of what to expect with the insurance and with the repair process. He also promised he would update me with repair work and update me with my insurance, making sure that the repairs were being approved and covered through the insurance.  He was the middle man and he made it so easy and carefree for me and my insurance.  That says a lot of the customer service I was given when every party involved was beyond happy with everything.  I am also so happy with the repair work.  It is beautiful, you would never know where I was hit.  There was defiantly no corners taken with the office or repair workers.  This Caliber Shop went above and beyond and I can not thank them enough for making my car repair such a smooth and easy process.  Thanks again Michael, I appreciate everything you have done for me! Caliber Cooperate you are lucky to have Michael and his team.  I am customer for life!</Text>

What can I say about this place..? They are absolutely the finest! From the first time I called in to the day I picked up my vehicle Alma was respectful, attentive and considerate. After dealing with Alma for a few minutes I knew that my car was in great hands. Repairs where done accordingly and correctly as estimated. I can thank the staff enough for the extensive work they did to my car and all the extra little touches they did. I feel so content to know that there are virtuous individuals that truly care about ones assets and go out of their way to complete the task at hand.<//text>

<Review>Horrible. Had my car there for a week did a half as job. Still had scratches from the accident and still had the nerve to hand over a car that had not been properly fixed. Had a worker there take pictures of the damages that had not been fixed. Told me to come back on Monday I went and they tried to give me a hard time. Trying to indicate that the damages where new. Had me go back today. So I went back and they tried to buff it out. Did not work. They got fully paid for a horrible job. Zero stars.</Review><rating>1<//rating>< date>

We brought our car for body work to Caliber Collision (CC).  Michael inspected and Stephany prepared our initial and also insurance estimates and have set up an appointment for its repairs almost immediately.  We then dropped the car on the scheduled day at the workshop and subsequently started getting updates on its repair progress by CC as well as from a customer service representative almost everyday until the repairs have been completed (ahead of the projected delivery date).

Michael worked on our car assiduously as it was his own, did an outstanding job in terms of professionalism, quality and schedule and has assured us of resolving any future issues pertaining to his work.

We really appreciate the customer exceeding expectation delivered by CC and thank Michael and Stephany for their remarkable efforts on our project.< /text>

I had an appointment for an estimate here. Unfortunately paperwork from the insurance company hadn't come through yet so the estimate couldn't happen.
The woman was extremely helpful though. She took as many pictures as she could so that I wouldn't have to return once the paperwork was approved. And she explained to me as much as she could. I would go here again if I needed to in a heartbeat.< /text>

That attempt failed.    The good news is that other local  providers exist that are part of USAA' s network. Working with TAG Collision now and they have exceeded expectations.  Unless you have a lot of time and patience, don't bother with Caliber.</text><time>1508184630889<//time>< name>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Customer service is lacking badly.  They towed my vehicle without my authorization, Then they lied stating I gave them verbal authorization to move it. When I asked for my rear license plate back it mysteriously disappeared from the cart containing all the auto parts that were disassembled from the vehicle.  After looking for for more then an hour and a half it then mysterious appeared coming from another building.  Oddly enough, it was with one of the same guys who was helping at least four of us searching for it the whole time.  I believe he realized I was not leaving without it.  Possibly he overheard my phone conversation to my wife stating I was going to report the license plate stolen.  It also happened to be a valid license plate with current registration DMV stickers on it.  I will never take another vehicle to any caliber collision business again.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>This location only... Service advisor Bob wait s for you to ask questions rather than take the initiative to explain work done or provide warranty summary. "Office manager" Rachel condescending  and unorganized. They do not provide updates has they occur and rely on you to follow up continually to ensure timely resolution.

<username>Daniel Botero</username><Review>I should’ve read the bad reviews and given them the attention they deserve. It’s a long read but believe me it will make up your mind in regards to ever taking your vehicle here.

The have been repairing my vehicle for over 3 weeks now. My service advisor Leslie won’t even call me anymore or give me updates on the status of my vehicle after she completely mislead me and gave me the wrong timelines. Alma the manager of this location was very nice and helpful at the beginning but now she is the one who does the calls and tells me that my vehicle is still being repaired. This place has no organizational skills what so ever my car was assembled and parts were missing almost as if a kid was putting it together and realized “hmmm I think there is a light that’s supposed to be there” after my vehicle has been “being assembled” by one of their best technicians, this genius didn’t check my air conditioner prior to working on my vehicle, so who do I get a call from? You’re right the manager asking me if my A/C worked prior to getting there. Any shop that receives a vehicle does a full walkthrough and inspection so situations like this can be avoided but again that’s not caliber collision in San Marcos. Needles to say they told the insurance the wrong completion date. I’m out of a vehicle that I use for work, a rental and all alma offered to do was fill up my gas tank with regular or premium gasoline but the kicker is my truck is a diesel fuel truck. So again is this the people you want handling your vehicle?

It’s too sad that you can’t go any higher than this in regards to complaints but since zero stars is not an option well there’s my one star for them.< /Review><time>1516825061900</time>< userid>

My teenager crashed my car, Met Life Auto recommended Caliber.  They took care of having my car towed to their downtown shop, and let me know that they were backed up due to the weekend of rain (San Diego drivers, booooo). They offered to have my baby towed up to the San Marcos shop. Once there, Mark and his team took awesome care of me and my car.  They were in constant contact.  There were a few hiccups with the repairs so it did take longer than I expected;  however, their professionalism and care made the experience smooth, and the extended repair time was no biggie.

You can trust your vehicle in the hands of Caliber!!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Wasn't able to make my original appointment @ 8:45am. Very dissapointing to find out they are not flexible on time, nor were they willing to compromise with me on a later drop off time. Now being forced to drop my car off a whole week later. 👎< /review>

<user_id>103859381351358786121</user_id><Text>Middling food, high price, poor experience.

Seoul Sausage is a Korean + Sausage fusion restaurant. Dishes include Kalbi sausage with kimchi relish, chicken sausage, Korean fried chicken, and others (the menu was not fully built out yet. Combos include a can of soda and tater tots for $3 extra. You order using a tablet.

First, the food. My group tried everything that was available on the menu (the restaurant was not fully stocked since it literally JUST opened): Kalbi sausage with kimchi relish, chicken sausage, Korean fried chicken, and the tater tots. These were all... fine. Nothing really to write home about. The Kalbi sausage with Kimchi relish should have been a wow, but it could have just as easily been a bratwurst. The chicken sausage was a sweeter version of andoiulle sausage. I was unimpressed. The fried chicken was better, but needed something to go with it to balance the dish. And the tater tots were, well, tater tots. For the price ($8 for 1 small sausage on a bun) we expected to get something substantial or something that really WOWed us.

The experience. I couldn't stand the experience. Cold, detached, and not friendly. The user orders for themselves using a small terminal, but nobody saw that you had to do this. The terminals just looked like point of sale terminals, not self service kiosks. I didn't see any signage for it, either. The kitchen is open, and the chefs are right there to look at you, but they didn't help either. The presentation was a little weak - the food came in simple paper cartons and drinks are just cans of soda.

To sum up, Seoul Sausage has many of the trappings of a food truck - fusion fare, loud noise, sort of rude staff, cans of coke, high prices - but none of the charm or exceptional food.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Located in the Oxnard's Collection Annex, this was my first time here.  I had the  Sweet and Spicy Chicken Bowl which had sweet and spicy chicken sausage, kimchi rice, fried egg and house hot sauce.  There was a little kick to the spicy chicken but it was just right.  The service was good and fast.  After eating here, the family and I went and saw a movie at the nearby theatre.  Good time was had by all.< /text>

Loved the #1 spicy sausage on a bun!

Pro Tip: while you're watching on your food, this place is right by the "Bottle & Pint" so get a beer too! They go GREAT together!<//Review>

<Review>I came here on a Monday night thinking it was going to be busy but the service was great. The food was different but it was very good. This place reminded me of Gen Korean BBQ that’s at the collection as well. The service of the workers were great and very helpful. I will definitely be coming back and will be telling others about this place.</Review>< gmap_id>

We got the KBBQ sausage bowl. The sausage was well cooked and juicy, the egg was scrumptious and the tater tots were killer! Definitely coming back. Yum!< /review>

I used to work at Amazing Lash studio around the corner from the annex and one of my coworkers recommended this place and said you can get tots with meat and all kinds of stuff on it. Being that I am from Simi Valley, this amazed me because we don’t have anything like that around and I absolutely fell in love with Seoul Sausage. Especially the tots with carne asada 😍< /text>

<Review>I had a #2 combo a couple weeks ago and it was delicious ! I went in for another one yesterday and it was not the same quality . It was a different man who made it for me , “black LA hat”.  The other younger man should definitely work more ! The quantity was too little and no show of neatness .  No disrespect but guy needs more training .< /Review><user>105130066291711101587< /user>< gmapID>

< Review>
This place looks really cool and the menu looked tasty.   Unfortunately the service is awful.   Firstly 2 employees stood in place staring at us not taking our order when we said we were ready.

They got one of our orders wrong and had attitude when we simply checked to see if we were mistaken.   After sending the order back it returned 20 minutes the same wrong order.

Never coming back again.<//Review>

The worst place in the annex to spend your money, just another over priced hipster restaurant! The food is overly mediocre and that is without factoring in the price, go elsewhere you will thank me later. Microwaved meals from the freezer isle would be better than the slop served here.<//Text>

This was our favorite spot but we came in today around 7:40ish pm to order 6 KFC bowls to go and the girl went to ask the cook and came back to tell us that they couldn't because the fryer is turned off...really

So we went to the new spot I think it's called Ramen...n ordered teriyaki bowls....our new spot now< /review>< user_id>

This establishment clearly needs more training. Sad to say it’s the manager that needs it the most. If you’re told be a customer that the order is wrong, there is no reason to treat a PAYING customer poorly. Just do your job & fix the issue? Poor service, will not return.< /Text>

Think of this place as a hidden treasure. it’s in the back of the annex food hall, and it is so underrated!! for the most part it’s cheap and your portions will get you full. right now i’m having trouble trying to finish the tater tots!! my brother got the california bowl and he’s loving it.
i recommend completely!! plus, whoever is in charge the music, send me your playlist because i’m loving it!!<//Text>

The "owner" of this establishment will soon be deported for his incompetence. The lack of customer service is baffling. If you are hungry please visit the many other surrounding restaurants. Thank you & god bless.<//review>

< review>
I am livid about my visit this evening to your restaurant in Oxnard.  I was excited to pick up dinner after a long mountain bike ride and take it home to Ojai. I have enjoyed food in the Los Angeles location and was so happy to find it in Oxnard.

First, I was told by the nice man behind the counter that he was out of cole slaw.  It was shortly after 9pm and online the hours were until 11pm but he said they changed them to 10, and they actually have "last call" at 9:30?? Honestly, I was pretty upset as that is the only reason I fell in love with the sweet/spicy sausage sandwich (the coleslaw being the sweet). I finally relented to taking it without, against my better judgement.   For some reason, it took OVER 15 minutes to prepare my food even though I was the only customer.  Weird.

I finally get home with my food and find I have only TWO of the THREE sausages that I paid for.  No coleslaw and gypped out of a dog. I will NEVER return.<//review>

This place is pretty dang good and Landon and Ben, our chefs and servers, were knowledgable and quite courteous. Get the Kalbi Poutine, you won't leave hungry!
Also, the KFC(Korean Fried Chicken) is better than the colonel, I swear.<//text>

<review>Lola's has everything you need for a Fiesta at your house!  The bakery has delicious chocolate flan cake, meat market has marinated meats, Pollo or traditional Al Pastor and Fajitas, seafood, farm Crema, Salsas, Cheeses, veggies, also cooked Mexican food. Best fresh roasted peanuts good for snacking.< /review><username>Maria Barteaux<//username>< pictures>

Honestly, I only stop here for the Mexican bread. Their produce is overpriced and the customer service lacks.< /Review>

Not too much English spoken, don't seem to be too crazy about gringos like me. But they have a lot of good stuff there. This is where I buy my fruit and juices. Check your prices while shopping, they can be a little tricky. No problem for me I'll be back.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

This market is becoming a major shopping stop for our household. You can get very good prices on produce and meat without having to buy a minimum amount. There is a meat counter in the back where you can buy exactly the amount you want. The people who work there are always really nice and helpful. They have excellent Mexican food to eat in or take out too</Review>

Super burrito was the size of my forearm. Salsas are delicious. Carnitas was a little grisly, lacking a bit of that nice citrus acidity but overall super yum.</review>

And in the jewelry store inside Lolas de Petaluma they do not return the pennies, they keep them, they did not return them to me I was sending money and like 5 people went to change checks and I did not see that they gave them coins, I do not know if only that day or they always do, I definitely do not recommend it and I will never return.

(Translated by Google) Ok ... a lot of attention .... this place has a very good variety, fresh fruit, fresh meat, more or less good prices but it is understood.
Butchery ... not all, but most of the "butchers" or people who serve you are worth it if you ask them for "ONE POUND- TWO PIECES- HALF POUND" if you pay attention they give you MORE THAN YOU ASK! ... ALWAYS!!!
Every time I go I ask them for one, two or three pieces of meat, chicken etc because I live alone.

But these people always give me more than what I ask for and I end up with extra meat without need, that they can't COUNT ???

How difficult is 1-2-3 bone! It is not a science project to attend the butcher shop!

Complaint two:
Not always but 5 times I am overcharged! All for doing it to the races!

Anyway, I recommend it? ... yes ... just pay close attention to what you buy and ask for!

(Original)
Ok... mucha atención....este lugar tiene muy buena variedad, fruta fresca, carne fresca, más o menos buenos precios pero se entiende.
Carnicería... no todos, pero la mayoría de los “carniceros” o personas que te atienden les vale madre si les pides “UNA LIBRA- DOS PEDAZOS- MEDIA LIBRA” si tú lo pones atención ellos te dan MÁS DE LO QUE PIDES!... SIEMPRE!!!
Cada ves que voy les pido uno, dos o tres pedazos de carne,pollo etc porque vivo solo.

Pero esta gente me da siempre más de lo que pido y termino con extra carne sin necesidad, que no pueden CONTAR???

Que tan difícil es 1-2-3 ósea! No es un proyecto de ciencias atender la carnicería!

Queja dos:
No siempre pero de 5 veces una me cobran de más! Todo por hacerlo a las carreras!

En fin, lo recomiendo?... si ...solo pongan mucha atención a lo que compran y piden!< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) The truth is that I only give it 2 stars because the tellers do not greet you and do not even say thank you they stare at you as if you were less than them, especially a cashier boy.
Keep in mind that the wages of each and every one of them are paid by customers in purchases

(Original)
La verdad solo le doy 2 estrellas por que los cajeros no te saludan y ni te dicen grasias se te quedan mirando como si fueras menos que ellos en especial un muchacho  cajero.

<Review>Popular w surfers. Lot and area a bit more t developed than I like but you can walk north to get your own little piece of private beach. Park on street and walk in for free entry unless u have family. Drive in and pay w family. Picnic tables, Porto potties but no Yogi Bears. 😮🌞😎👍</Review><rate>4< /rate><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMCxDrIlDOk8AAHswg88B-ycDp3gn36tZn_j6eF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< user_name>

Great place to bring the fam and watch the surfers catch some gnarly waves. I have seen many boards broken here.</text>

<Date>1590364833569</Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>This beautiful beach was almost empty. We came here on Sunday, Memorial day weekend and came down a really steep and narrow path directly from the highway, hitting the middle of the beach. It was perfect to practice social distancing as there was no one around us withing 200 meters on both sides of the beach. Water was so clear that we saw a nursing shark or something that looked like that couple of feet away from us. The only downside was that one of us unknowingly stepped into a tar and it was quite a struggle to get it off the foot and bathtub,  so watch your step:) Main parking was closed but you can park on the highway and walk down to the beach.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80e83da300ad74a1:0x71983c5b5f4ab3e1<//Gmap_id></record>

The beach is usually full of mountains of algae that attract flies! You have to walk a long way to find a descent spot.... Only portable restrooms available. Not good for swimming....  Lots of rocks bounce off your feet leaving bruises and sometimes draw blood!< /Text>< user_id>

Easy parking. Maybe 30 steps down to the sand. Best point break in SoCal. Big waves + long rides. Fun to watch em. And you may come upon some terrific driftwood sculptures on the beach.< /Text>

<review>Went here for a beach clean up. It actually is naturally quite clean as all the trash washes to the top of the beach at high tide so you can play on the beach and in the water with nothing to fear. The main activity here is wind surfing, as it is always very windy here. So not the best place to relax and enjoy a quiet afternoon on the beach. They were a joy to watch and everyone performed very well as the conditions were perfect.<//review>< rating>

With parking & bbq's on the top & sturdy stairs to walk down, this is a great beach. Showers on the mid level where the life guards are, a surfers & wind sailers for days, there's plenty to stay entertained. My favorite beach in So. Cal, by far!<//text>

Plenty of sand to take a long walk, and there is a lifeguard here most of the time. Good reef for snorkeling and scuba diving when conditions are calm. Very basic facilities.  Parking is reasonable, or you can always park on PCH and walk into the parking lot<//Text><user_name>Geoff Walsh</user_name>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) A beautiful beach on the edge of the road with fresh winds but warm water for a soak and still enjoy the scenery .. waves a little big.

Una hermosa playa a la orilla del camino con vientos frescos pero tibia agua para un remojon y seguir disfrutando del paisaje.. olas un poco grandes.< /Text>

<text>Friendly stylist! Listened to what I wanted and did very nice cut. I'm picky because I am balding like many older men. Kim did a great cut that maximized and worked with what I had to make me look like the professional I am. This is a full service salon and prices are better than chain stylist/salons.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fcea1e8559079:0x94139834f04682f7</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< review>
My wife had a haircut here sometime back and it wasn't to her liking. The person who did her hair was polite and nice but I guess there was some communication gap or she wasn't experienced. She listened to what we had to say over and over as if she understood but in the end she just did what she felt like😂. I found it funny but my wife wasn't amused 😂</review>

New to San Jose and was in dire need of a hair cut (7 months overdue), Angie cut and styled my hair beautifully. She was very attentive and sanitised all equipment prior to seating me for my appointment. Good price and good experience.<//Review>

Loving my new look.Parlor was big and spacious, you can take appointment or do walk in as well.I went to her for consultation and then took appointment for later when I made up my mind.

<Text>SUCH A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE AT LYNN HAIR DESIGN!
Not really as expected!
And the price is weird. A lady called Mai told me the price is $65 when she checked my hair at the beginning . But at the end , after its finished, a lady called Thao took me $70. Even though I said Mai told $65, but she still said my hair is long and it's $70.  $5 doesn't matter to me because I was going to give them tip, but I just feel uncomfortable with the way the took my money .

[Updated] 3 days after that.
They told me no shampoo for at least 2 days after perm. I didn't shampoo for 3 days . And when I first did my shampoo, OMG!,  it just returned to ... straight hair. Just like I never got a perm! Some hair is wavy a little bit (JUST A LITTLE BIT, doesn't look like the photo of model I showed them before I started) , but most hair are NOT WAVY AT ALL. In addition, my hair became so dry , some were damaged . I think they didn't use good stuff to perm my hair, the person who did it for me had no experience in perm, too (she was scolded by the owner because she put mousse on my hair in a wrong way !) . So, I went to the store, they admitted that's not a good job and promised to do again for me. I said I'll be back after 2 weeks because I don't want to damage my hair by having one more perm right away.

[Updated] After 2 weeks
I suffered my terrible hair for 2 weeks , then came again and showed the owner my hair . PERM doesn't work + Hair were DAMAGED ! I told her I hope this is the last time they fix because I don't want to damaged my hair many times. And do you know what she told me ??? " Go to another store and do it". Then she returned money. Omg, She got me waiting and now then just refuse it in 1 second! I can't believe . I feel so weird about this store ! Eventually I didn't say anything and just went out. I felt I cannot trust them !

SUCH A TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE ! This is first and also the last time !< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>TERRIBLE AT DYING HAIR !!
NOT GENTLE
BAD QUALITY SUPPLIES
BAD COMMUNICATION
DISRESPECTFUL
RUDE
if I could show a before and after picture I would, Angie Phan bleached half of my hair with no blending skills at all. I left the salon with puffy and tangled hair,  After I asked if she can fix it she blamed it on my hair being “to thick” then blocked me from replying. Terrible customer service. I DO NOT recommend this salon. ZERO STARS !! Don’t trust her with your hair.</Text>< rating>

Ambient is nothing special. Place is dated and full of graffiti on the tables. I ordered a breakfast pastrami and an ice coffee. Came out to more than $11. They were pretty stingy on the sandwich meat too when compared to the picture on the menu. See pictures I attached. It's item I (French Bread w/pastrami) in the breakfast menu. Look at the pictures and you be the judge.
Need the restroom? Be prepared to pay for the use of their dirty restrooms. They actually charge you 75 cents to use their restrooms if you are a customer, but if you are not a customer you can't use it at all. Lol wow! What douchebagerry.

Walked in needing 2 dozen donuts for my work crew.  Person in front of me was helped.  The person at the counter then ignored me and went to the back.  I waited a few minutes for her to return.  She did not.  When I asked for service, I was met with a loud, "I'm making a sandwich".  Waited another few minutes and she didn't come bk out.  I left and patronized the shop a block away< /Text>

Hot donuts every morning on the daily I eat hear regularly everything is up to standard even the ice cream tastes fresh and dry unlike other places who have half frozen ice cream I like the fresh cooked meals made and handled well by the friendly staff who put in pride in what they do they have stunning drinks from ice brewed coffees to countless slushie drinks</review>

It's 12pm, the donuts are left in a display that isn't closed off (exposed to the ambient air) so the chocolate topped donut I had was a bit stale. The chocolate was flavorless and was barely coating the top.< /Review>

<Review>Excellent service, quality food, the kbbq combo has a bit of everything for a nice price for a party of 2-3. The wooden interior and design sets a nice atmosphere.</Review></record>

<Review>Unbelievably over-priced. Horrible pricing. Can you believe this grilled short ribs is the large portion for $40+? If you haven’t noticed, there is a bed of raw onions at the bottom that also count towards the $40+.< /Review>< pics>

Nothing like hot Mandu Guk on a cold chilly SF day!  Lovely decorated Korean Restaurant in Heart of Japantown, with great service and great food!   But beware of what is A-ROUND this neighborhood on POST Street...... TIME IS ECHO OF AN AX WITHIN W..OO..D.< /text>

The service and the food were good but it’s a bit overpriced. We ordered their signature steak (golbi — might spell it wrong :p), pork belly, shrimp, and one soft tofu soup. For me the shrimp was the highlight. One side note is that their lettuce (for you to wrap the meat) was probably one of the best I have ever had at KBBQ in west coast.< /Text>

<GmapID>0x808580bed9afabe3:0x6984b39ba244b968< /GmapID><Review>We ended up here for a late lunch (1-2pm) because every other restaurant in Japantown was full with a wait.  We were so surprised that it was empty, and wondered if it was a bad sign.  Reviews were mediocre, but we decided to give it a try and were NOT disappointed.  This was our first experience at a Korean BBQ, and the waitress, who knew plenty of English, was really patient with us and very helpful in choosing dishes.

I have read some reviews that said children are not welcome here.  We had our 4 year old and 7 year old boys with us, and the waitress was very kind to them, and helpful in choosing dishes that they might like based on their dietary preferences!  We all enjoyed the beef bulgogi and side dishes as well as the noodle soup.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to friends visiting Japantown!< /Review></record>

Overpriced and lacking. Service was good. I literally could have made each dish i ordered, shopping at Trader Joe's.....but I get it, they probably have to pay $$$$ rent for the space<//review>

<Review>We had a BBQ combo and it was really good. I’m not a Korean so I can’t tell if it’s authentic, but this is probably the best Korean restaurant we’ve been to in the Bay Area.

We used to live in Auburn AL where there are a lot of decent Korean restaurants because of the KIA factory plant nearby, and we’ve been missing those. Glad we found a new one here!<//Review>< pics>

Over priced food, horrible service.

The portion sizes are tiny for such a high price per item. Complete tourist trap. Get the all you can eat bbq instead.<//Text>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>My family and I used all of our brain power to make the most honest review. We took into perspective portion size, price, quality, decor, and service. Portion size was horrible, we have that a 0, they gave us our water in a shot glass and all night we were joking about  how small the portion sizes were. Price was super expensive for what they have us and that was a 1. Quality we gave it a 7, they did well with their food presentation and the meat was cut well. Decor was nice and it was clean so that was an 8. Service was almost non existent except for the guy who sat us down so we gave it a 1. That leads us to a grand total of 17. We divide 17 by the 5 categories and we come out with a score of 3 out of 10. We divide that by 2 because google is a 5 star rating place. So the final rating is 2.

We're not coming back.</text><gmap_id>0x808580bed9afabe3:0x6984b39ba244b968<//gmap_id>< username>

<text>This place is alright. Their Galbee meat is good but not cheap. It's 40 dollars on a small plate. But the taste is great, I love it.

Mackerel is also very good.

You do get a lot of side dishes, rice and soup. You can get free refills on the side dishes so you probably won't go home hungry.

Service is usually pretty friendly and fast.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>The layout of the restaurant is very modernized and sophisticated. The service provided was very nice and the food was very good although very spicy but I should have expected that. I would definitely come again however to this place and try something a bit more soothing for my tongue.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>The food taste is not good and quality is on the low side.  The service also is not good.  I went on a slow time with only 2 tables to serve and It took a long time just to get more water.  The price is high for the taste and quality.  For a full bbq restaurant the side dishes should be good but not here.  There is only few different types of side dishes and the taste was not good.  If you are looking for korean bbq then go to any other korean restaurants in SF.  I know the korean food taste and quality well and this place is definitely a not good place.  They also added 20% tip on my bill since we had 6 people.  I certainly did NOT want to give even the 15.  I happened to be in the area so decided to go to this restaurant.  What a mistake< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Introduced Korean BBQ, to Karin, we have unsuccessfully tried to find a decent one for a long time. Looked for one in London and finally found this one in SF. And it top the list so far… best one I had, I guess we have to go to Korea to beat it!</text>

Not wealthy as Ad says. I and my wife when to there, and I had $42 per person dinner, and then I get the food, one is short rib, so small piece which may half as the #16, and then Saba fish, you can have it any any Japanese restaurant around $10, and then vegetable and few other dishes which are regularly automatic have. We spending more than $100 for tow, and then left more than half everything,(Because no good tastes. Any way, This is my last time to when there.
Again, Too expensive and not such good as other Korea returnables does.</review>

I'm with some other reviewers. This is not a place you would like to come back. And here is My honest review: super over priced food; worst Korean BBQ experience; the waiter is rude. Plus, they won't change your grill. Remember they only change for 3 times. You'll have to sit smoke and boiling oil😞< /Review>

They won't change your grill.  All of us got burned by the boiling splashing oil by just
sitting there. They take away ur side dishes for "refilling" and then just forget about you.
They ignore your hands all the time.

This is not what I expect with their service or food quality at all.

Very disappointed. Will NOT come back.< /text>

I love Korean and was excited to visit Seoul Garden. I had bibimbap and many side dishes. The food tasted fresh and authentic and I particularly enjoyed the kimchi which was perfect. The service was very good and I enjoyed the ambience of the restaurant. I will certainly return in the future<//Review>

My family wanted to go to Japan town mall to do some shopping and I wanted to eat Korean food so I found the Seoul Garden restaurant online and thought it was perfect since it was right there in the mall. The atmosphere was okay. There wasn't that many people there. The price of the food, I thought was pretty pricey but went ahead and order anyway since I wanted to try this place out. The waitress made us wait a really long time to place an order and not once did she came and ask how we were doing. Maybe she doesn't speak any English but it still would have been nice to see if we need anything else. My husband did notice she went over to other Korean customers more. The food we ordered was alright, I've had better. I guess there you don't wait for them to bring you your bill. I had to go to the counter to pay. I wanted to pay with my Discover card but they do not take that so I paid with cash. I told the gal to keep the change for her tips....it was about $5 in change. She told me that wasn't enough and pointed on the receipt that her tip should be about $7.50. I should have just said it's not the law I have to tip this much and the service wasn't that great but being the kid my momma taught me to be..I pulled my last twenty dollar bill and ask her to break it so I can give her the extra $3.00. I left unhappy with the service and the taste of the food as well as felt like I wasted time and money that could have been spent somewhere a lot better.</text>

<Time>1482817552220< /Time><rate>2< /rate><Text>Holy Moly this place was *cheap* despite of seemingly expensive look of the set up. Service was cheap, attitude was cheap, quality was cheap and I am still scratching my head for the reason why I went to this eatery.

OK back to the full course (BBQ table). We came here with a high expectation of better food and service due to its higher price tags on the menu compared to EVERY other Korean BBQ places we've visited in the past and boy I was so wrong on this. The only time when we were attended was at the entrance by the restaurant owner/manager and the experience just went downhill from there. During the ordering, the waiter only said what you *must* and what you *cannot* do. For instance, in order to sit by the BBQ table, one has to order at least 2 overpriced meats and they would not change your charred smoking grate until you beg so and here's the catch, they would only allow to change 2 times and that's why if you let them do your BBQ, they would just *pour* everything on the grate to save their time and trouble. There are a lot of other hidden rules that you would probably not notice until it's too late. During the whole dinner time (about 45 mins), no waiter/waitress came to say anything except when we asked for a new grate, and they did not refill any of our water/tea, nor our sides. The only interesting interaction was when I stopped the waitress from pouring everything into the grate, she aggressively handed over the tongs and pushed plates under my right elbow. However they became super *attentive* when it's near the end of the course and ready for the check. They would literally check your seat every minute to see if you have placed the credit card yet or not and couldn't wait to see you go after everything's done. What a contrast.

In regard to the food, it's OK and that's the reason I gave it a 2 star instead of 1. However the food is severely overpriced by about 50% and you couldn't even find a an appetizer that's less than $10. Every BBQ entry  (about 10 oz meat + lettuce) is from $30 to $50 and the quality is just so so. I've been to other much cheaper places where both food quality and service were superior. I would not recommend anyone who has a second choice to go here. You could probably have a better ROI of your poor $70+ on lottery- at least you could daydream a few days right?

Oh here's another interesting fact. The menu posted at their entrance does not reflect the true prices on the actual menu because they've bumped the actual prices a few times. Another interesting finding is that their actual menus are not consistent either. Some menus have salad-#8 option while the others do not.

Anyway, San Francisco in its own is a beautiful and charming city in our experience. This place, however, is a such disgrace to it.< /Text>< pics>

(Translated by Google) There is no answer. The food tasted just as good, but it took thirty minutes for the food to come out despite I had booked it from 6:30 pm.

He also gave me a doenjang stew for 10 minutes and then gave me mackerel and rice for 5 minutes. Seafood pancake took thirty minutes.

All of this was just because of the immaturity of the restaurant, so I was late to take care of the locals who came later than us.

The locals will take care of it. Ignore the tourists and take care of the locals.

Tourists ... There are a lot of restaurants here ...

답이 없습니다. 음식 맛은 그냥 그렇고 아침부터 예약하고 오후 6:30 시간 맞춰서 갔음에도 불구하고 음식이 다 나오는데 삼십분이나 걸렸습니다.

그것도 된장찌개 하나 주고 십분 있다 고등어주고 또 오분 있다가 밥을 주더군요. 해물 파전은 삼십분 걸렸습니다.

이 모든게 그냥 식당의 미숙함 때문이면 화가 안날텐데 가만 보니까 우리보다 늦게 온 현지인들 부터 챙겨주느라 우리것이 늦더군요.

현지인들은 가보세요 잘 챙겨줄 듯. 관광객 무시하고 현지인 부터 챙겨주니까.

관광객들은... 여기 식당 많은데 굳이...?< /review>

<text>First time trying this Pizza and the Location. Took a bit longer than most Franchise places, however I gotta say - give this place a try! Plus honestly, its a bargain. $21 bucks well spent.

<review>The 🍕 is AMAZING‼️💜💙❤️ even if it cost $50 I'd say it was TOTALLY 😍 worth it! Ironically you can get a large pizza for ONLY $5 👀!! 1️⃣you walk in 2️⃣you order 3️⃣get your pizza 4️⃣you go home... EASY! Even when they've been crazy busy and had no pizzas on stand by I've NEVER waited longer than 5/7 minutes😁. **IMPORTANT🛑 : if you decide to get pizza after 9:00pm EVEN THO 🙄 the hours of operation posted state "open until 10:00pm" they SHOULD mention that; NO ORDERS WILL BE TAKEN AFTER 9:30pm/9:45pm LATEST... SO, to be safe - I recommend being INSIDE the building and ORDER - NO LATER than 9:30pm.👌👍<//review>< username>

I would give a 0 stars if I could ,the girl in the register taking orders named Rumina D has a bad attitude at taking orders and wasn't have a nice professional attitude at attending  customers and the pizza I got a pizza wasn't even fully cooked, I been buying pizza from this place for many years and never had a problem but that employee Rumina did a bad job so sadly I will stop buying from this place.</review>

<text>Horrible. I called in an order for a pepperoni pizza. Came and paid to pick it up. They said it would be 15-20 mins. I said ok. half an hour later after many others got their pizza, I asked when would ours be ready. She checks the warmer, pulls out our pizza and it seems like it's been sitting there. It was coldand when we got home it was hard and tasted terrible. Yuck</text>< pics>

A thoroughly professional team. Everyone wore masks, kept me informed at all times, and were clearly skilled at what they were doing. They worked like a finely tuned machine. Exceeded expectations at every turn. Exceptional value for the cost. I wholeheartedly recommend this company. They will not disappoint.< /review>

< review>
Eleven years ago I got a solar system from Solar City/Tesla.  The inverter never worked correctly and it had to be repaired or replaced 12 times in 10 years.  Since they refused to extend my expiring warranty, I searched for other companies that would give me a reliable system.  Solar Watt listened to me and worked to update my system with a reliable inverter.  The cost was reasonable and  feel that I can finally be confident about my production.  I've found them to be an honest business.<//review>

Solar Watt Solutions is the real deal.  We transitioned to solar in 2012.  One of the smarter things we have done.  We interviewed several companies.  Some of which were clowns.  Dave presented our options clearly without pressure so we could make an informed decision.  As a small business owner ourselves, all we were looking for was a company that offered a quality product, at a fair price and stood behind their word.  Now 2020 I can confirm that Solar Watt Solutions does all of those.  Since our system install 8 years ago, we have referred Solar Watt Solutions to several friends that inquired about our experience and added them into their mix of quotes.  All of which ultimately went with Solar Watt Solutions and communicated how impressed and happy they were with their experience.  We also expanded our solar system to increase production to accommodate a "geo electric water heater" converting from propane hot water heater.  Another smarter thing we have done.  But the real reason for posting this review now after 8 years is that after the succession of heavy storms that we experienced this winter we experienced a leak under a panel section.  Hey it happens.  With no question Dave sent out his crew and remedied the situation promptly and professionally standing behind their warranty.  I generally do not post reviews.  If your in the market for solar you need to include Solar Watt Solutions them in your fact finding quote mix......the rest will take care of itself.< /Review>

But, I  wanted to wait until now for my review so that I  could honestly report on the Pool Heating and Solar Energy production combined.  I am happy to say that my Pool Heating is working perfectly  and that I am producing the Solar Energy that I expected to or more.

Before I made the decision to go with Dave Watt at Solar Watt Solutions, I did my due diligence to research several companies. At the end I made the decision to go with Solar Watt Solutions. The process was made very simple and provided me with all the answers to my questions and concerns. The biggest thing was their honesty about the entire system and process. I live in Murrieta and that was not a problem for them since they work in all the San Diego and riverside areas. My main concern was getting the process started before the end of the year and I am happy to say they even beat the deadline. The system was completed in November and I wanted to wait before I put my review to see if the system is functioning to the capacity that they said it would. Well, I am happy to say it is doing better than I expected. Thank you Dave Watt and Solar Watt for your beautiful work and for your honesty.< /Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I just went live with my Solar Watts Solution's installed solar system (4.8 Kw). I am very happy with it.
From the begging, my sales representative Ollie was taking an excellent care of me. The company closely listened to my needs and wishes. Watts Solutions was always very willing to adjust and customize my system. Ollie worked with me through all my options in the deepest detail until I fully understood my best choice.
My install was fairly involved. From replacing my old roof, changing the old main electric panel, installing a new level 2 EV car charger to digging a trench to the street to support my new solar system, the company took an excellent care of all the aspects of the entire install. Everything went smoothly. The install was hands off for me. Watts solution handled everything end to end. I highly recommend using their services. You will not be just a customer, Watts Solutions is a true partner that will guide you and help you make the right choices during your solar journey.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80dc721ed83c3baf:0xc85b1d6040dd36a6<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I bought a home that had solar panels already installed and noticed a leak in my house.  I called a roofer and they said it was from the solar panels and that it would be best to find a solar company that could come take a look.  Dave was referred many time on my Nextdoor app so I reached out.  He was so great!  Answered all my questions and was totally honest and said it would be best if I could really find who installed them because there is a 10 year warranty on solar panels/installation.

Thanks to him I really made an effort to find the company and that put the panels on.  They came out and checked the leak and I was a little skeptical of the backpedaling I was hearing.  I immediately called Dave for his advice.  He’s honest and trustworthy and I would recommend him to anyone and everyone who wants solar.< /text>< Pictures>

<Text>Outstanding service from start to finish.  We purchased a home in April that had solar system, but a broken inverter.  The inverter was under warranty but the previous installer that installed the solar system for the previous owner was no longer in business so we contacted Solar Watt Solutions to replace the inverter.  Even though this was a small job they got me up and running and provided outstanding customer service throughout the whole process.  Would highly recommend!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures></record>

Dave was very thorough and made sure that we would be able to generate all of our electricity from our panels but would still have room to grow (ie add AC or an electric car) if we need more electricity. The installation was fast. They are honest and trustworthy. Highly recommend for anyone looking for solar in Carlsbad and North San Diego County.</Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

If you are looking for a trustworthy company look no further!  They were recommended to us by some friends and we are so glad they did.  We interviewed 5 total companies and they were the clear winner.  They were very transparent, answered all of our questions and put us at ease about the whole process.  Ollie didin't try to "sell" us solar he helped us to make our home more efficient.  This was not what I experienced with  the other 4 companies we interviewed.  They all had a clear motive and it was a waste of our time. Choose Solar Watt, you won't be disappointed! Everyone from Solar Watt has been fantastic.  My husband said the installation team was fantastic, and he does not give praise easily.  This was an easy choice for us to make.  They truly are a 5 star company!< /Text>

Dave, Jim, Steve and the crew were fantastic every step of the way. The communication, pricing, and service are absolutely top notch, and I could not give a higher recommendation to Solar Watt Solutions.

Do your research and you will see that Solar Watt goes a step further. For one, they did an honest assessment of our needs and sold us an appropriately-sized system, unlike a couple of other companies we spoke to. Second, they installed a Level 2 charging station and paid to have the warranty extended, making the entire solar/charging system warrantied for 25 years. Third, they recommended a roofing company they partner with that was stellar (Adan Cruz Roofing).

Finally, the entire process, from signing the contract to SDG&E approving and turning on the system was 52 days, including an entire roof installation. And this was during the holidays!

Thank you, Solar Watt Solutions, for a great experience!< /text>

We interviewed several companies that included referrals & others from our own research.  After meeting with Jim, it was clear that we were speaking with the most knowledgeable representative.  Other companies recommended more panels at a higher cost but Jim explained it wouldn't be necessary which in turn saved us thousands.  In addition, Solar Watt offered the panels & installation at a lesser cost than anyone else we interviewed.  Everything was coordinated seamlessly & we appreciate everything Solar Watt offered to help us with our needs.  Highly recommend this company!!!</Text>

Home project that involve contractors are rarely smooth.  There typically seems to be a hang up with materials, weather, a crew has to be put on an emergency job, etc.  Well, working with Solar Watt, none of this was the case. The work was done on time and they were flexible with a couple of our requests and made the whole experience extremely positive and smooth.  I do not hesitate recommending them for solar.< /text>

Dave Watt and his company Solar Watt Solutions has exceeded our expectations in every regard. He was recommended by our roofing contractor for his honesty and quality of work. Our system went on line September of 2017 and has performed above expectations ever since. We are producing slightly more electricity than we use. We put off installing solar because of appearance. Their installation is neat clean and mostly out of sight. We hardly know it's there. We get a report monthly from Solar Watt Solutions. Questions I've had have been answered quickly by phone or email. I feel they will be there for me in the long run. It is now fun to get our SDG&E bill. Thank you Solar Watt Solutions<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>As an electrical engineer I waited to purchase a solar power system until I found Solar Watt Solutions. I have kept pace with the developments in the solar power products, the local San Diego solar systems contractors, power company incentives  and tax based rebate programs over the years. My tipping point came about after meeting with  the system designers and engineers at Solar Watt Solutions.
I had all my reservations of timing my system purchase addressed honestly and with many verifiable facts from industry website sites and watchdog organizations supplied to me by Solar Watt Solutions.
I was made aware of Solar Watt Solutions through multiple respected sources, most of whom were customers. Colleagues in the construction trades also had very good things to say about Solar Watt Solutions. They have their own crews install all of their systems. They are a small cadre of professionals with pride of workmanship. Their system designers have years of product and system knowledge and can claim prowess well above that of their competitors and would be “ professionals”.
They are a small company whom is pacing their growth and concertedly planning their marketing plan. They do not advertise. Their  sharp penciled personalized system prices do not include ANY additional costs built into them for advertising. Call this company after you have been assaulted and marketed into mind numbing product confusion and sticker shock. They will can and will educate you if you want and give sources to research, if you need that. They also treat you and your home with respect. Be forewarned... you’re gonna love ‘em!!<//text>< pics>

We hired Solar Watt Solutions a couple of years ago to install solar panels for our home.  They were knowledgable and helpful in choosing the right panels for our electrical demands.  We have contacted them only a few times since installation, and they were quick to respond to our questions. I would recommend Solar Watt Solutions to anyone interested in installing solar panels in their home or business.< /Review>

We have nothing but good things to say about Solar Watt solutions! Choosing a solar contractor is a very daunting task because of the sheer amount of competition and many in this industry use aggressive sales tactics, including badmouthing their competition and claiming superiority in a way that only they can measure. Meeting with Andrew for the initial consultation was very easy, he came to our house at a time that was convenient for us, gave us enough information for us to realize he understood our needs, but at the same time, he did not overextend his welcome trying to rush us into a hasty decision. The installation staff lead by Octavio were absolutely amazing! Very polite, did an outstanding job, worked hard, worked fast and made sure we knew what was installed on the roof and in the garage. We own a 2-story house in Carlsbad and these people are expert ladder climbers! They are able to carry a solar panel on their shoulder faster than we can climb up our staircase. Some of their local competitors have a mandatory crane installation that cost over $2,000 per day alone, but these people know what they are doing. Our system was installed very fast, and activated within days after an easy inspection with the city and verification from SDGE. Our system is already producing more energy than expected, and it comes with app monitoring via the SolarEdge app that gives real time and historical data. We are very happy we were diligent in finding the right company to install our solar panels and highly recommend Solar Watt Solutions!< /Review>

We recently decided to check into solar and after meeting Jim with Solar Watt solutions we were extremely impressed. We actually vetted 2 other companies and by far Solar Watt Solutions system, warranty  and technology was superior. We use the CoolPV Solar Panels - which uses thermal heat from the panels to heat our pool.
We have been very pleased with every aspect of our installation process -- They were very upfront and professional. Dave has also been great to work with . Everything went exactly as they promised.
We have had our system for a short time, but are extremely happy.<//text>

Solar Watt Solutions was an absolute joy to work with all the way around and they deserve the highest rating available. Even now that the system is installed and operating, I’m still in a bit amazed at  how seamless the whole process went with absolutely none of the “common” contractor delay/horror stories.
We live in Valley Center and had quoted 5 different companies for the 18 panel job. The Solar Watt Sales team was very responsive, professional and the quote was received the same day!  Even after discussing a few variations including number of panels, different manufacturers and controllers, each time the updated quote was received very quickly.  This happened with no one else, and in fact I needed to call two other companies to ask when I could expect the quote.  Pricing was very good and they never asked for an upfront fee. Only after the system was turned on and accepted by SDG&E, was payment requested.  Further, they were able to improve upon the original installation date and when it came time to install, they actually upgraded portions of the system at no additional charge. Now that it’s operating, it’s also very fascinating to watch the output on my computer.
The installation team was friendly, polite and professional.  Nice guys with friendly attitudes that didn’t mind me asking lots of questions.  Originally planned for two days, they finished in about a day and a half and totally cleaned up the site when they finished.
There are certainly many solar companies to choose from, but in my opinion, what sets these guys apart from others is their no pressure, extremely responsive, and flawless execution mentality.  There is nothing more I could have wanted from a Solar company, so to say I am very pleased and would highly recommend them is an understatement.</review>

<text>My company is PCH Services and one service that we provide is solar panel cleaning. Solar Watt Solution and my company have been working closely for about a year now. We both service but not limited to the Carlsbad and Encinitas areas. they have been referring me to their clients and vice versa. I have referred my clients to them for solar panel installation.
I cannot say enough about the professionalism and punctuality of this company. My clients have raved about the effortless process they have experienced with Solar Watt Solutions. I will gladly and eagerly recommend them to all of my family and client base. Thank you so much for such a wonderful business relationship! We look forward to a good, honest and hardworking 2020 season😁😎</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>We have installed solar panels into two of our houses and have used Solar Watt in both cases. We're very pleased with Dave, the owner, who takes his time explaining the available options, benefits and drawbacks, and has accommodated all our needs and requests. He offers the latest solar technology and does not charge a premium for that. His prices were quite competitive, especially with the big companies out there. We were quite happy with the work of his team, timing of installations and overall outcome. We have recommended him to our friends and neighbors.<//Review>< Pictures>

I did a lot of research before speaking with any solar suppliers, as the subject was new  to me. Then I contacted four suppliers, two large and two small, and requested a plan and bid to install solar in our 5,750 sq ft home in Rancho Santa Fe. Dave Watt, owner and operator of Solar Watt was included, as he had been recommended to me by my roofer who I have done business with for thirteen years. After speaking in detail with each of the four suppliers, Solar Watt was an easy choice.

Dave asked for the information from my electric bill which he needed to develop a plan and then came to the house and showed me four alternatives, clearly explaining each in a very accurate manner. (The two big suppliers told me things I knew to be incorrect and tried to sell me a larger system then I needed.They were also more expensive. The other small supplier offered a slightly lower cost but could not answer several of my questions about the system they were proposing).

The installation by Solar Watt was flawless with everyone and everything on schedule. The people working on the job were full time employees, not subcontractors, and were well trained and knew exactly what they were doing. Dave handled all of the paperwork including the permits and tie in to the electric company.

The final benefit is that Solar Watt guarantees in writing  that the system they design will produce 100% of the electricity promised each year, or they write you a check for the difference. Certainly one of the best suppliers I have ever worked with. Feel free to ask Dave to provide you with my name as a reference.</Text>

My wife Barbara and I had Dave Watt from Solar Watt Solutions install our solar system several years ago and believe me it was one of the best financial decisions we have ever made. He was extremely knowledgeable regarding solar operations and did not try to over sell us on extra panels or extra equipment, he knew exactly what would work for our home. We have a custom built home with custom tiles and many varying roof angles and he had his crew installed them in the best areas for maximum efficiency. His crew did an excellent job and were very quick and efficient and not a single tile was broken or damaged. The entire job took only a few days. Dave and his onsite supervisor were there every step of the way and kept us informed of their progress. When the city inspector came to certify the completed job, he had nothing but praise about the entire job and stated we would get the all clear in a few days to turn the system on which we did. We purchased our system instead of renting or leasing which was best for us, we received just over $8,000.00 credit on our taxes for that year. Our solar system has been more effective than was projected. We run our A/C quite often during the warmer months plus she has an all electric car which cost us nothing to operate. I think we have had 2 or 3 electric bills of less than $20 each but did not have to pay because it rolled over into credits which balanced out with the next statement.

SolarWatt Solutions designed the right system for our house, gave us a reasonable price, did a high quality installation on time, and we have been getting the predicted energy savings ever since.  They answered all my questions in detail and did not try to pressure us during the sales process.   We are very pleased with the result.< /text>

Since I had some ideas on what I wanted to choose, and what I wanted to do, they worked through different panel options/availability with me, and we found the Enphase system that would work best for my installation.

Solar Watt was a pleasure to deal with from the first meeting all the way through the installation. I first met with Dave Watt (yes his name really is Watt). Dave gave me all the details and options and the difference between the different type systems that people install. There was never any pressure and you could tell that he truly meant that he would never install anything that he wouldn't put on his own house.

He set us up with Hero financing which was the easiest financing I have ever done, and the Hero folks were a pleasure to deal with. We put a high quality LG system on the house with no money out of pocket and no payments for a year. It is great watching the electric meter spin backwards. I can even monitor how much electricity I am making every hour online.

The installation team was also great. Everything was clean and professional and the system wiring looks like it is part of the house.

They say they will give you an honest evaluation whether you go with them or not and that is what I felt working with them. Of course I did end up using them, and happy I did.< /review>

< Review>
We moved into a house that already had solar, but it was poorly supplied and the previous seller told us it covered his solar bill which was in fact a lie. When I reached out to the previous installation company, they were less than helpful. Many companies did not want to touch our house because of the existing solar, but Solar Watt worked with us thoroughly so that we could come up with a plan that would work with our current system. Ollie did a great job and had great patience when both my husband and myself wants to address many concerns and questions. The job was handled professionally and swiftly. We will be referring anyone who needs solar to Solar Watt. Thank you!</Review>

The bytes that bring this post to you were powered in their origination by the sun, thanks to Solar Watt Solutions.  The fingers that mashed out the keystrokes (that formed said bytes) happily wrote a final check for a beautiful 8 kilowatt array, knowing that the check was an investment that will pay off three or four times before the warranty on the panels expires.  Our goal was to make an investment over our heads would reduce our overhead as we head toward retirement, easing our anxiety about our increasing electric bill.

What we didn't know was how free of anxiety the process would be with Solar Watt Solutions.  Morgan, our sales rep, patiently and professionally kept in touch with me after an initial proposal, while I was distracted with other household projects.  When the time came to go green, owner Dave Watt completed the project in under a month... and that includes the time it took for us to spruce up the section of roof that would hold the panels.

We could not be happier with the process and the results.  My wife commented a number of times on how professional and friendly the crew was.  Dave and Morgan responded to each of my queries very quickly, always by the close of the business day and often after hours if a question hit me late.   Their math was solid, the price was right, and the results are outstanding.

I would go on and on, but I'd rather get back to checking the app that is telling us how much electricity we are generating.<//Text>

<review>We were referred to Solar Watt Solutions and met with the President Dave Watt. My wife and I were impressed with his sincerity and his presentation.
When they came to install the solar panels we found them to be efficient, reliable, on time and met all the commitments they made to us.
We also felt they went "over the top" to make sure everything was done correctly and to our satisfaction.
Based on our experience we would highly recommend this company for your solar panels.

< Review>
In 2015 we interviewed four (4) solar companies to give us estimates on a ground mount system that would be designed to produce as much energy as we had historically used annually (on average for the previous 5 years).  David Watt of Solar Watt Solutions was the only company that answered every question we had on site and who could design a system for our specific needs / wants and flexibility to add to in the future.  Most companies send "sales staff" out to give quotes, but when they are asked technical questions related to the investment you are about to make they (strictly sales people) defer to having to ask someone else, which was highly undesirable and less than ideal for building confidence when wanting to achieve the shortest return on your investment (ROI).  SInce 2015, Solar Watt Solutions has installed systems for a number of my friends and clients that I've sold homes too.  I have the utmost confidence in Solar Watt Solutions because of their actual pricing, performance and customer service follow up.  Hire the best when investing in energy generating solar systems.  Hire Solar Watt Solutions.
I am available if you have any questions or require additional information.<//Review>

We highly recommend Solar Watt for residential solar panel installation   We were on the brink of signing a lease agreement that would have foregone our tax credit and then I remembered Jim Mahoney and am so glad we reached out!  Solar Watt had our installation up & running in days and we now get CREDIT bills from SDG&E.  Our home value has increased and we are not on any payment plan.  Solar Watt was prompt, professional and attentive!</Review>

I've been looking at solar systems for the past couple years and was completely put off by the sales tactics used by other companies I met with. Then I heard about Solar Watt Solutions and decided to look into solar again. I'm so glad I made the call.

Their sales rep Jim was extremely knowledgeable and presented me with a very clear and honest assessment of my current power needs, the various panels available, and the return on investment of each option. There was no pressure and my extensive research prior to his visit confirmed that Solar Watt Solutions proposal was extremely competitive. I'm sure you could find cheaper panels somewhere, but I'm certain that you won't be gouged by this company.

Another pleasant surprise was how accurate they were on estimating when they could have the work started and finished. Their crew was very professional and had the system up and running even faster than promised.

If you want to support a local business and work with an ethical business owner (Dave Watt) who cares about both the quality of his work and his reputation in the community, look no further than Solar Watt Solutions. Our system is running flawlessly and it's so nice not having to shell out big checks to SDG&E anymore!<//text>

< review>
Honesty and service is what I got from Solar Watt Solutions. SWS was recommended by a friend who had done his own installation. Dave Watt came to my house and suggested what I needed.  I told him that I wanted to do my own installation. He agreed and did calculations with his gizmo to determine the best panel number/placement and gave me a price.  He handled the permitting process and sent me the materials.  They arrived on 3 pallets in about a week and a half if I remember correctly.  The hardest part was finding the location of my trusses beneath the concrete roof tiles.  I had questions about what the plans they gave me and was able to talk to a person who clarified what I was to do.  After about 3 years one of the reporting gizmos failed, they noticed this because they must periodically monitor systems.  Dave himself came to my house, found the failure and replaced the component all free of charge. Since installation I have never owed SDG&E in fact with my 25 panels i now have a $235 credit with SDG&E. I recommend them without reservation.<//review>

I purchased my solar system from Solar Solutions  in 2013. My bill went from $600.00 per month (2.5 acres, pool, well) to $300.00 per Year.. I feel so strong about Dave Watt and his integrity that I have referred six friends who have also purchased from Solar Watt..</text>

We were having some issues with our Enphase Solar system connecting to our wi-fi network, and since the company who had done the install for the previous owner of our house was no longer providing service I went to the Enphase website to find another installer/service provider who might be able to help.  I found Solar Watt Solutions on the Enphase website and gave them a call.  The gentlemen with whom I spoke was very professional and courteous and let me know one of his technicians would give me a call within a couple of days.

Dave Watt gave me a call and spent almost an hour on the phone with me walking me through what needed to be done.  I finally got it connected and then later that night I saw that not all of the microinverters were sending data.  I called Enphase customer support and after some trouble-shooting the lady suggested I call my installer.  So I called Dave again and he walked me through a few steps until we got it figured out and fixed.  And all of this at no charge.

In my mind that is next-level customer service to provide that level of service to someone who isn't even your customer.  He very easily could have scheduled a service call and come out and charged me for what he did.  I would definitely recommend Solar Watt Solutions to anyone looking for a top notch solar company.< /text>

Well I didn’t get an agua fresca because they only had one and due to my flavor instincts when being pregnant are the best so I didn’t like the drink they had in stock. I got a bean and cheese burrito. It was queso fresco so it wasn’t bad of a burrito. The beans were black beans and were okay. But the hot sauce had such a good kick. And the music was so 80s and it was a cool kick to listen to on my break to work. It was a little dirty but they were attentive with me so I appreciated that. Just a little dirty and the beans were okay, and not enough variety for agua frescas other than that it wasn’t bad.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80c2b86015907adb:0x6cfe3f343c8f83be< /GmapID></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) Of the two occasions that I have bought there. The first time beef, they gave me 70% fat and bait, the second time, pork chorizo ​​... I know that the meat they use is the one that is left over from the day, but when I get home and only open The bags, that reeked of rotten meat! I didn't even cook it, I drove 30 minutes back and almost threw their rotten meat in their faces ... too bad I can't give them 0 stars.

<Review>(Translated by Google) This place lost the flavor of Oaxacan meat, 6 or 7 years ago if I had seasoning, I bought half a pound d cup and half a sausage, I ended up pulling them, nothing authentic taste of Oaxaca, I will never return there, bad in everything

We had our brunch here. They have a fantastic menu. Kids loved mango mania smoothie and pumpkin pancakes. We loved avocado pesto toast. Garlic fries and vegetarian burger was delicious. Oh! The lavender latte and monkey mocha with oat milk were very flavorful and yumm.  Person at the counter was very nice and suggested good vegetarian options.<//Review>

Recently has an early lunch and was advised to try the Breakfast Rice dish.  WOW!!!   I passed on the egg on top but the rice with gobs of bacon was outstanding.  Very good coffee and service. My wife had her usual avocado open face on the best french bread around.  All egg dishes are well prepared and presented. Even with COVID there are a lot of people dining outdoors .  I am hooked on the Breakfast rice.  We have always enjoyed dining at the Coffee Co. because of workers are hard working and deserve our patronage and tips.. You get very good food with atmosphere from the locals.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</review>

This place is a solid breakfast and lunch place for locals and tourists alike. Starting with breakfast, they have a wide selection of coffee and tea drinks. The breakfast sandwiches (design however you please), breakfast rice (amazing to go option and even better as hangover food), and the pastry/mini pie collection all provide ample breakfast options. The lunch selection is mostly sandwich based. The grilled chicken pesto sandwich (pictured) is AMAZEBALLS in the best of ways! Who would have thought a huge grilled red pepper, mustard, and pesto would have made such a good flavor combo, right? This is not a fancy brunch spot, but it is a great place for friends to meet for breakfast or lunch.< /text>

<Review>Ordered caramel late and two bite size cheese cakes (one plain and the other blackberry).  Coffee was decent with good flavor. Cheese cakes fell really short. They are really dry and stale.  I posted a photo of the two cheese cakes (a picture tells a thousand words). You can identify the photo by the two small cup cake size cheese cake with forks on the side. The blackberry one is awfully dry. $2.50 each. I must say that’s a waste of $5.<//Review>< Name>

<Review>The pastries and pies we got tasted like they had been refrigerated for a month. No taste. I don't remember the last time I had a piece of pie this bad. I wouldn't be surprised if the pasties were all baked off site and just brought in. Def not baked fresh. Garbage cans were all over run and the coffee was cold.

There was no heart in anything we ate...< /Review>< user>

Crab cakes are made with imitation crab (actually fish). They gave me a nice piece of ham as a substitute after my complaint, which helped me enjoy my benedict. The pouched egg was great. Their bagel sandwich was delicious. Also, they have bite size and mini desserts, which looked nice.</review>

This place was so yummy! Breakfast was delicious and they had great options. The potatoes weren't my favorite only because I dont like bell peppers and I did not realize they came with peppers. They had the best waffle I've ever had and I LOVE waffles! The mocha was very tasty- just a little bit sweet.  We will return here the next time we are in town.< /Text>

Great coffee and nice baked goods. Can only give a 4 because of the single restroom that is never clean and most  often an employee comes out after a customer is waiting over 5 plus minutes. Too many customers for just one restroom.< /review>

My sandwich wasn't bad, it just wasn't outstanding. There wasn't a lot of chicken in it and I was still hungry after my lunch. But I'd already paid $17 for food and a drink so I wasn't too keen on spending more. So that was a bummer. Also, only one bathroom for such a large place, so if someone decides to take their time in there, the line can get long. On the bright side, it was a nice quiet place to be for a while and everyone was very nice. And my tea was really delicous.<//text>

I have hit this place a couple times on my way through town. The coffee is always good and the pastries selection is pretty good. They have a larger menu then you would expect and the coffee bean selection is above average.
Parking lot is a little strange you enter at the opposite end from the coffee shop and wind around the back to where you saw it from the intersection.</text>

I previously gave 5 stars, know I'm changing it to 2 stars due to their lack of service for breakfast.
The pies are worth 5 stars but breakfast 1 star. Our food sat at the window for a good 5 -7 minutes, omelette cold and salads are hot.<//Text>

When we came inside we noticed these little bite size pies and couldn't resist trying some. We got the pumpkin pie, berry pie, and the peach pie. My boyfriend added an iced coffee to that order and I just got water. The pies were so cute! The peach pie was our favorite, the other two weren't bad either. The service was friendly.<//review>< Pics>

I got the bacon and eggs with toast. The bacon was very thin and tasteless. And not enough bacon was given for the price that we paid. The eggs were also tasteless. The toast was very dry and tasteless as well. I feel like they were slightly overpriced on everything and the quality of the food was not good. Their service was pleasant, however.< /Review>

Local favorite. Love the Mushroom omelette or the new B.O.A.R omelette.  Good bagel sandwiches. Gotta be the Borgia.  Also the bite size pies. Delicious. Just know it is counter service style.< /text>

Food was not the best and service was average.  I found it to be way too expensive for what you get and overall quality.  I had a chicken pesto hot sandwich and the amount of mustard on the sandwich was overwhelming and drowned out all the other flavors.  The curly fries were standard.  I had the passion iced tea: wow was it tart!!  For my son and I to have lunch there it was over $40.</review>

First time here. Was looking for a simple breakfast. 2 eggs over easy, hash browns and bacon. Instant turn off was you prepay for your breakfast. Then while using the apple payment app it ask if you want to leave a tip. Order it at the counter then pay and get a number. The service was friendly and prompt however the 2 meal $30 breakfast was not. Bacon was very thin and tasted like paper. Hash browns were dry and tasted like old grease. I also ordered a ginger bread cookie and it was very dry and over done around the edges. Not worth the calories. It wasn't worth wasting my time complaining or to reorder. I felt writing this review would be easier. Oh and there was only one bathroom with a long line no toilet paper. I went to Starbucks across the way to order coffee and use the restroom. Other than the friendly staff the experience was disappointing.< /review>

<user>110060471389617024393<//user><pictures>None< /pictures><text>First time visiting this establishment.  Me and a friend ordered two sandwiches and a small double latte.  I guess they misunderstood and made it a large latte.  No big deal.  Forty minutes pass and we haven’t heard anything.  My coworker goes up to the counter and inquires about our order politely.  The cashier (who did not take our order) seems baffled.  You ordered sandwiches HERE?  You’ve paid? What’s your name?  Yes lady, we ordered food and paid and we have been waiting longer than it would have taken us to go to the grocery store, build a campfire and roast the ham ourselves.

It wasn’t that complicated and no one was paying attention.  I understand that mistakes are made but we were completely forgotten.  On top of that she made it seem like we had done something wrong by ordering food at the register of a restaurant.  The sandwiches were super soggy by the time we got them and it was about 20$ for two sandwiches and a coffee made wrong.  We will not be coming back.<//text>< rating>

<Rate>4< /Rate><text>My wife and I enjoy coming here for breakfast. Their drip coffee is still my favorite in town, and their staff is consistently friendly. The prices and food are average for the area. There's elements of truth in many of the recent 1 star reviews. Their hash browns had gotten worse for a while, but lately they have been spot on. It's also true that the bathroom is ill equipped for the amount of traffic at a coffee shop; I won't go into details, but it's best to keep your wits about you. Also, the child seats' belts are completely worn out. As locals, it's in our regular rotation though.</text>< pictures>

<review>Super average. The lemon poppy muffin was so dry. The portion sizes of the breakfast plates did not match the price you pay. We had to pay extra for chicken apple sausage. Uh, why? I've been spoiled by other brunch places that aren't stingy with servings. Service was lacking. I cleaned up my plates and went to the register since I didn't know where to put them and no one helped me (3 people saw me just standing there).</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The pie selection here is pretty extensive. They have pecan, lemon meringue, chocolate silk and way more too. The good thing is the pies are quite small and reasonably priced at around $4.50 each which is perfect for two to share.

The coffee is pretty decent too!

Everything in the cafe is pretty cheap to be honest but is good quality. Is it the best? No, but there is good value for money.

There's no real ambience here so it isn't somewhere you would hang out and it wasn't overly clean when we visited. I'd come back if only for the pies but I wouldn't sit in. It's really close to half moon bay so just grab things to go!< /review>

<Text>No organization and a line started to form to the door, and for no reason other than ineptness. Food tasted good, but died in the window and was cold by the time it was served.  Three orders sat in the window for over 5-mins.  One order was delivered to customers, (who arrived after we did); then, knowing there was more food in the window, the staff member went back to the register for a t-shirt sale instead of delivering the rest of the dying food.  Unsat!

It appeared there were no procedures in place for proper customer service, or possibly there was just not enough staff.  The infuriating and frustrating part is that customers are required to pay AND tip prior to receiving food or services; so I suppose what's the point of good customer service, if they have already banked a tip.  At the end of the day,  I would like my money back for being served cold food, and if that's not possible, I would at least like my 20% tip back for letting our food die in the window and the fact I had to ask for our food and deliver it myself, so the remaining dying order could be taken to the other customers.< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>Cute coffee shop in half moon bay. Don't let that strip mall location fool you. Lizeth at the counter is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, warm and adds a great deal of positive energy to the place. She let us sample a bunch of loose leaf teas. Definitely a stop for a leisurely afternoon in HMB.</Text>< date>

They offer three sizes in most beverages, and coffee ☕️ is served in ceramic mugs👍🏻unless you're getting it "to go."
A wonderful blend of locals and visitors from the city and over the mountain, where it's been soooo hot!
They come to Half Moon Bay for the day and hit the beach with the dog...
then Main Street for a bite to eat...</Text>< username>

You order at the counter but they will bring the food to you. This place is primarily a breakfast place. Although they call themselves a Coffee Company, I have not really noticed that their coffee service as anything more than average. In fact, on a scale of 1 to 5 where 1 is day-old gas station swill and 5 being the finest crafted coffee served in Milan, I would put it at about a 2.5.
The food is standard fare and is well prepared and tasty. Most of the ingredients seem fresh and their bakery is excellent. I give it 5 stars because their service is completely commensurate with the price. Also, it has an outdoor dog friendly seating area when the weather is good.</text>

One of the few places in town to get breakfast, so they are busy on nice weather weekends....and have a hard time dealing with the business.

Eggs were cold by the time we got them.

Offering chicken apple sausage sounds good, but it was pretty bland.

Before we finished we were asked twice if our plates could be removed.

It won't make you sick to eat here, and it's not overly expensive.  Just don't expect too much.   Lowered expectations are the key here.<//Text>

<Review>Not impressed with the meal and the service. Lots of mistakes in one of my friend's meals. Additionally, I had the Greek wrap and it was very very oily, and the olives in the wrap were also pretty weird (overly salty, and a very vibrant purple colour). The fruit on the side was very unripe. I would not recommend.< /Review><Rate>2<//Rate><name>Ella Rasmussen< /name>< resp>

I am not a coffee connoisseur whatsoever... Coffee was good, menu seemed pretty extensive nice ,friendly, hip staff, and the best part is that is just a couple of minutes away from the beach. When I went last weekend I actually spent couple hours they're just hanging out with friends it's a nice place to sit down and have a nice love meaningful conversation over coffee, definitely going back next time I am in half-moon< /text>

Additionally, I had the Greek wrap and it was very very oily, and the olives in the wrap were also pretty weird (overly salty, and a very vibrant purple colour). The fruit on the side was very unripe. I would not recommend.< /text>< Name>

I would give them zero stars if i could. Poor service, took 30 mins to get breakfast food that was burnt. I'm not sure how you overcook scrambled eggs and pancakes, but they were both terrible. The bacon was burnt to a crisp.  I am typically forgiving of poor food as most places have a redeeming quality, but i cant find one here.  People seemed to enjoy the pastries i guess, but i would not recommend them for a meal.< /text>

<Review>Had an unfortunate event take place at this place I usually enjoy. Granted, it was the pumpkin festival, but I waited over an hour for my food, around 730 am. Others who got there later got their food first, and the manager didn't do much to resolve my issue except offer me coffee.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Great service and food, all for reasonable prices. Much better than the chain coffee shops, and less expensive, too. Great pastries, pies, and cakes, too, although they are more expensive than several of the drinks. If I had to complain about anything, it'd be that the service can be a little slow if it's very busy.</review>

<text>Let me start with the fact that my wife LOVES this place. Whenever we are in HMB, she always wants to end at this coffee shop for their hot chocolate and desserts. It's important to get there early if you want desserts as they will sell out throughout the day.

The coffee is fair with plenty of options (and a decent price), and the staff is often attentive and helpful. The space is a little less kempt than before, and the bathroom is a little on the scary side.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x808f74b45e762209:0xac82e96fac10286e< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Nice place. I love it here. There is both indoor and outdoor seating where you can bring your dog.
Coffee is self serve and really good.
The omelettes are outstanding and they have lots of other choices as well such as pancakes, scrambles, kids choices.
To park you have to go around the corner, or you can park before the bridge and have a nice walk across it.
Plenty of flowers outside so if you sit out it's really nice to look at and smells good !!
Get the Florentine omelette!
Servers are friendly. There is free Wi-Fi and across the street is a farmstand with fresh produce.</Review>

<text>You really should not eat here. I never leave bad reviews of places, but this place deserved it. I ordered a quesadilla with a side of hash browns. I received part of a quesadilla with my mushrooms on the side with french fries. The chef apparently forgot to put the mushrooms in the quesadilla and they thought it was still acceptable to serve? Normally the quesadilla is supposed to come with sour cream and salsa. It came with neither, and when I asked for some, they forgot and I had to remind them. Then, believe it or not, they served me pico de gallo, not salsa! Who would put pico on a quesadilla......

This is BEFORE I even get to the food quality. The French fries had no flavour. My friends hash browns were white and cold. The pineapple was also WHITE. All of my friends had bad meals. Totally not worth the price either, and they make you choose whether to tip beforehand.<//text>< UserId.>

Pretty average beach and $10 to park. The town, which isnt walking distance, is more interesting and a good place to get a bite or a drink.<//Text>

< Review>
On our trip, we made a stop at Half Moon Bay to walk the touristy shops on main street and we ducked into the Half Moon Bay Coffee Company for some lunch.   What a great decision this was.    They have both a great breakfast (which is served all day) and lunch/dinner menu.   A good number of selections available on both.    Here, you stand in line to place your orders, and they give you an order and bring the food to your table.   I choose a patti melt and my husband had a ruebin.   Both were delicious.  Only complaint, if I had to come up with one, is the glass of ice tea was very small and if refills were available, it was not expressed.

They also have a great array of desserts in the case that looked delicious and at reasonable prices for their size (I mean delicious looking concoctions !!!).   But, my jeans are getting tight, so had to pass on them.   The coffee also smelled delicious.

I highly recommend this stop.</Review>

{'time': 1517350898211, 'text': 'Hi Bryan,\n\nThank you for your review and honest feedback. It disappoints me to hear you had this experience. I have addressed this issue with my kitchen staff and the waiters. The cook line should have not severed a burnt waffle and certainly the waiter should have not taken it out and requested for a new one before going to you. This is not the standard we set on a daily basis and it angers me to hear you did not receive the service you deserve. I do hope that you will give us another chance in the future to show that these problems were one time occurrences. Again thank you for taking the time to leave a review, because of honest customers like you we can try and make our business better.\n\nThank you,\nJay'}<//Response>

Tasty local spot for breakfast. Can get very busy on weekends. Offer a selection of coffee blends as well as Expresso drinks. Follow them on Instagram, randomly they will put out coupons there.</Text>

The teriyaki chicken sandwich was pretty good and quite messy. They should really have more than one tiny restroom. After eating my sandwich I definitely needed to wash my hands but there was a pretty long line for the restroom. The oreo bundt cake was a little dry but pretty decent. The service was hit and miss. Some of the employees seemed friendly but others not as much. Oh and the passion tea was good.</review>

Didn't realize they closed so early in the day.  Place was dirty, coffee drinks were OK.. Couldn't even get milk without going back inside and going behind the counter... They pulled the milk pitchers at 3:45.  Place stunk of ammonia because they were mopping the floors... Will try one more time in the future.< /Text>

<Text>Just save yourself the time and grab a 7-11 coffee if that's what you're going for. I ordered a cappuccino with heavy cream and the barista had to the guy at the register what that was, he then told her "just use the regular milk, it's the same thing." Whatever, the coffee sucked and I ended up pouring it out a half mile down the road.</Text>< time>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) We bought a pumpkin pie, and the peach pie next to it looked more delicious, so we tried to change it to it, but it was more expensive than the pumpkin pie. So, after hesitating, the boss changed it to a peach pie for free. The coffee was good, the peach pie was good, the hot chocolate was good

저희가 호박파이를 샀는데 그 옆에 있는 복숭아 파이가 더 맛있어보여서 그것으로 바꾸려고 했는데 호박파이보다 더 비쌌어요. 그래서 우물쭈물하고 있다가 사장님께서 공짜로 복숭아 파이로 바꿔주셨어요. 커피도 맛있고 복숭아파이도 맛있었습니다 핫초코도 맛있습니다<//Review>
