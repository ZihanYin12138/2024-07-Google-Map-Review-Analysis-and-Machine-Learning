They have great selections of fresh and salt water fishes, and pet birds from time to time. Pet supplies on the wall was a little bit tricky to find because it look a bit messy at first, but it gets better as time goes by and by the time you are less disoriented and learnt their logic of placing stuffs around. Although it's a small pet store, but you will be able to get what you want. Decent price. Easy to find parking on the streets and the owner couples speak Spanish, English and Chinese< /text>

For a small shop this place always has a nice selection of fish both salt water and fresh. They even have corals . I definitely recommend taking a look.<//review>

I'm a second generation customer of this pet store. They have been our go to store for about 20 years. Joe is very knowledgeable (& bilingual!) about the animals. I go to his store for everything I need for my parrot I was gifted from his store 17 years ago. Family run and family owned. I don't know what I'd do without them.< /text>

If I can give this place 10 stars I will... I will because Joe and Doris (owner) there really nice person always with a smile on there face always there to help you. They have anything you need from salt water fish, fresh water, birds and dogs, cats, hamsters, snakes any kind of animal you might have at home. Whatever you need believe me you will find it here and if you dont see it just ask him he will get it for you. I come here because I have a salt water tank at home with his advice he guide on what to do what I need with my tank and so far is been 2 years none of my fish have die.
But I just gotta say come check it out there really nice people there prices on everything are good/fair I'm just so lucky to have them close to my house in my city.
Thank you Joe and Doris for everything you guys do and treat everyone keep up the good work.</Review>

<review>I saw in the pictures before coming to this place that they have green-cheeked conures in really small cages all together. Those kind of parrots need lots of space like other birds. Please try to take care of the birds as well as you take care of the fish!</review>< date>

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>This place is very small and people have a hard time walking around. They have a variety of fish and coral but they put as many fish in a tank as possible so there aren’t actually a lot of tanks. The prices are written on a sticky note which is placed on the tanks (hard to read) and some fish don’t have correct prices or aren’t placed right. They have one tank with coral and fish on a top shelf that you can’t even really see so there may only be two tanks of coral you can see. They have a nice variety of clownfish. They have a lot more fresh water fish than saltwater. They are called Bell Bird Farm but only have parakeets and love birds and the rest is fish and pet supplies.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Tight and noisy, this place is hell for hamsters and birds, their cages are too small and overcrowded with the animals looking sickly and halfway dead. The only good thing here is the fish cages which is actually what they seem to care about. The fish tank water is always clean with no dead fishes floating around, and all seem to be bright and happy. Don't bother buying supplies here because you'll be ripped off. Only semi good note is that they will buy any hamsters from you if your hamsters accidentally bred or you got two different genders accidentally. I think they also do the same with birds.<//Review>< pictures>

I loved this place because the staff was very friendly, spoke pretty good English and had a wide variety of Rare plecos for super fair prices ! This review is biased because I came into the store ignoring all the other pets and supplies, and focused only on their fresh water fish collection. However from an aquarium enthusiast, the fish selection is great ! And the staff is friendly and helpful!</review>

< Review>
I bought my pineapple conure Riley from bell bird farm 5 years ago and have not had to take my conure not even once to vet has been and still is very healthy. Their very attentive and take good care of the birds well all animals. What I like about them is that when you buy a bird, they make sure it's able to eat on it's own when it's a baby still about 3 months before they send them home with you. That shows the commitment they have with their animals and how good they take care of them, which means they care about their customers and don't want to or will not sell an unhealthy animal just to make a sale, that speaks alot about them. I would recommend this pet shop, and will be buying another bird in the days to come.</Review>

<text>Found this LFS by chance on Craigslist. Ad mention a large variety of hard to find pleco's so I decided to make the 20 mile drive to check it out. My first impression was that this place is small and I won't find what I'm looking for. Well I guessed wrong. Found an EDJD for 12.99. 12.99!!! My LFS wanted between $20-$40 for a 1" and got me a close to 2" for a lot leas. Also their pleco selection didn't disappoint. Vampires, golden nuggets, royals, avocado, and pelckoltia compta. Picked up a 2" pelckoltia for $12.99 which I found to be a bargain. Definitely will make the 20 mile drive in the future when I get a larger tank.< /text><gmapID>0x80c2cebc0c403489:0x58b92d84c17619fe<//gmapID>< Rating>

J & Js Final Coat has been painting the inside and outside of my house for about 20 yrs.  I couldn’t ask for anything more.  And I wouldn’t have anyone else paint my house.
I highly recommend them!</review>

I was indecisive about my colors and stain and Joe directed me to a paint store that had a stain brochure  rather than the individual little samples.  That was really helpful.  Joe and Jill were very patient with us in our final scheduling and we really appreciated the crew who came to stain/paint our house.   Frank was very thoughtful in explaining what steps they were taking for each day which was helpful in planning our day.  We are very happy with the final refreshed look of our house.  They even offer a warranty of 5 years  Thank you Final Coat!< /Review>

We hired J&J's Final Coat Painting to paint exterior of our house. The men worked efficiently and expertly, with courtesy whenever we spoke. They cleaned where they worked, leaving no trash! Truly professional job. Our house now looks brand new again and we are very happy to have decided the J&J Final Coat Painting paint our home. Thank you so much.</Text>

We recently purchased a house but weren't too fond of the interior wall color so we wanted to change it before moving in. After doing some extensive research online and getting quotes from various companies, we decided to go with J & J. The comments were nothing short of spectacular and our interactions with Joe, Jill, and Shelly were very pleasant.

Francisco and Ivan were our painters and they did a fabulous job! They were detailed, neat, and cleanly. A lot of preparation went into their process as they patched the walls, removed the wall plates, laid out drop cloths, and taped the edges with painter's tape and masking paper. Francisco was especially helpful. He pointed out that the bathroom ceilings were painted in a flat finish and suggested we paint them in a satin finish as it more resistant to moisture and easier for wiping. Talk about looking out for their customer!

We're so glad to have hired J & J to do this project because it would've definitely taken us longer than the two days that Francisco and Ivan spent painting. The quality of work was simply amazing and we would not hesitate to call them again for future painting projects.< /review>

<review>Joe came to the house and gave us a fair estimate; the team came to the house when they said they would, stayed on the job until it was finished, and did an extremely excellent job...down to the last detail. They even fixed areas of stucco that needed repair as a part of the job.  They cleaned up each evening before leaving and checked with us when there was need of an answer.  They were all courteous, thoughtful, thorough, and professional.  I would recommend Joe, Francisco and his crew to anyone!<//review><UserId.>109329025390891287474< /UserId.><time>1598307734679< /time><resp>None<//resp>< Rate>

I was able to view video of their work and decided to call them for a quote, not only were they reasonably priced, they were timely, efficient and took my dark cabinets to a beautiful white. I'm absolutely in love with them and I would definitely recommend this company to someone who is looking to refresh their cabinet's.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>It was a pleasure working with J&J as we had our kitchen cabinets painted. The entire team was helpful, professional and responsive to our needs. Shelly and Jill in the office, Joe coming to our home for estimate and Walter and Rick doing the job. They did their job each day cleaned up and we couldn’t even tell they were there. We are more than satisfied with the beautiful results and will contact J&J in the future for our painting needs.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

A short time ago, J&J's painted the exterior of our home.  They did an outstanding job.  They were so good - we recently invited them back to paint the interior of our home.  Once again, they did an outstanding job and we are very pleased.  J&J's does exceptional work.  They are professional, experienced, efficient, well-equipped, meticulous, easy to work with and a joy to have in our home.  And J&J's prices are very competitive.  If you want top quality painting at a good price - give J&J's Final Coat Painting, Inc. a call.<//Text>

Nice atmosphere.  They are in the process of renovating the interior.  Patched the skate floor, installed new lockers, and will eventually replace the speakers and skate floor completely.  I love coming here.  Bring your own skates (with clean, smooth wheels only) or you can use their rentals.  They upped the price a bit with the renovations, but still quite reasonable.</Text>

It is really fun. I love the new staff. You should all ways wear white it makes you glow. But I wasn't happy when they wouldn't play the song I had requested many times and it was completely appropriate. The food also took 30 minutes just to make some fries.</Review>

Skating is fun. No inline skate rentals. And as long as you're OK with the very explicit song lyrics for your younger kids, go for it. Also, disrespectful employees and management doesn't seem to care so much.</Review>

It's your typical skating rink; dark, smelly, but somehow very nostalgic. This particular place has been run down since I was coming here as a kid. You can't beat the entry prices, much less the snack/drink prices. It's all very cheap, with decent facilities. They keep the floors and carpets remarkably well cleaned. Plus the staff is friendly enough, although you seldom see the same person more than once.<//Review>

I am now 40 and have many fond memories of my times at the rink. When I was only about 7, Ron sold my parents my first ever racing skates. I spent many summer days there enjoying the music and all the fun games they had us play. I wonder if they still do the red light/green light game and the chicken song??? If you want a great family fun time and for not much money, Viking Skate Country is the place to go. I hope to someday return to see my childhood home and visit VSC one more time!<//Text></record>

It was my first time being here and my first time skating. The people are all family friendly, kind and supporting. The workers do their best to make it fun and have a clean show. The music was great, the games better, and the atmosphere was perfect for beginners and racers. I will definitely be coming again (and dragging my friends there too)</Text>

<text>We always have a blast here! The help is so accommodating too and prices inexpensive. Have been going here since the 70's and never been disappointed. We are pleased with their party packages too as they are affordable and have been enjoyable for my children and grandchildren. We lived in Redding but now come from the Bay Area to skate! 👍</text>< pics>

<rating>4</rating><review>A fun, inexpensive place to take kids for a good time. There is a snack bar and some arcade games. There are party rooms to accommodate birthday party's for eating pizza and cake as well as opening presents.
All that said, this place is way overdue for an update. It's been the same since I went there as a kid,  25 years ago, and probably long before that.</review>< Pictures>

Terrible customer service and hours of operation. Tried 8 times to reach them to arrange a birthday party only to be told they don't have time to help me, and no one ever returned my calls. No online assistance and the management is very unprofessional.  Used to love having my kids parties here, after their current service I will not spend anymore time on them. Sad to see a part of your past destroyed due to bad management and bad service.<//Text>

I will give it a four-star rating some of the games and arcades are little old but that's not what I go there for skating ring is very nicely well kept up there's never any trouble and it's great for when it's raining and really Smoky outside in Redding California due to the fires I suggest taking your kids you guys will have fun even the grown ups</review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><text>It's a great place to take the kids. I did have an issue with them not having a referee on the floor.
Also they have skater supports for beginning skaters. They are ok but I think they should have it where they are required to stay close to the wall because they get in the middle and when they fall they have issues getting up and their learning support tips over and they can't get it upright easily so some kids just leave them and try to get off the rink. I have seen other skaters almost roll over the hands of the learning kids.
They don't have the best selection of music and in the 2 hour skating session they only did one game for the skaters. Personally it's the worst skating rink I have been too. But for kids it's a place to go and they're at least out of the house in bad weather.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Yes...it's old, rundown and lost it's former glory but for only a few dollars you can spend a wonderful evening reliving all the days where roller rinkin' it was the thing to do! I wish that someday Redding would preserve this place better only because rolling around has a feel that can't really be replicated by any modern day "thing to do". Try it out and pro-tip; play the spot game! :)</Text><Rate>5<//Rate><Pictures>None<//Pictures><date>1489944313916<//date><username>Michael Chu<//username>< response>

<review>We came here today for a bday party. It was more expensive this year than last year, which wouldnt be so bad if they didn't also shorten how many kids can come for the party, but oh well. They also shortened the length of time you get in the room for the bday, and don't really help you set up at all. On top of that that if you want more soda for the party, its $5! For less than 2 liters! Half the games are out of order. The other half are play at your own risk, 3 machines ate our and other people's money and the staff just say... sorry, not our responsibility. Needless to say I won't be bringing my kids here anymore. I used to love this place but it's just a wreck.</review>< Resp>

This is really our only choice, but it is old and does the job, nothing special. The teenage "Referees" though, they are a bunch of kids on a power trip. I am sure they double as lifeguards at the city pool in the summer time.<//Text>

I watched young children running all over the parking lot with cars coming in and out while sercurity standing outside and watching but not saying a thing about the unsafe things going on. My son will no longer be attending any event at viking skate country!! Parents please be aware of our childrens surroundings!!<//text>< pictures>

<Review>I will always visit this park. I live in sd and still I pack a tent from time to time and grab a spot here. The restrooms are clean, sites are cool all with killer views And most importantly I feel safe here.</Review><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
Awesome place for a walk, bike, or horse ride. You can take a short one mile walk around the lake area or it connects with the entire Rohr Park area. The trails are wide with plenty of space. Reviews are very nice especially right now with all the flowers blooming. Easy to get to and plenty of parking. There are even picnic spots available and benches to sit and look at the lake.< /Review>

Awesome location with so much to offer. Right in the heart of Bonita and there is so much to do here with endless opportunity to hike, mountain bike and even ride a horse. You can go all the way to San Diego Bay from here or up go inland to San Miguel mountain but riding a horse you're limited to Bonita up to San Miguel mountain. The lake is beautiful and takes about 15-20 min to walk around and it's one of my favorite places to do photo shoots here in the South Bay.< /Review>

<Review>Love coming here and enjoying Morrison Pond and the ample walking trails. You never know what you will find here. There could be a horse themed birthday party, a haunted trail hosted by the Spring Valley Recreation Center or completely peace and quite and an abundance of wildflowers and wildlife. A beautiful place to come to enjoy nature!</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I like this park very much. Even though there are a lot of RVs here, the layout gives you room and a sense of privacy. The hikes from camp are terrific and vary in degrees of challenge. The bathrooms are sparkling. The only downside is that the park is not convenient to town or a market, requiring a lengthy drive to resupply.<//text>

Great Park with running trails, vegetation and a beautiful pond. If you are looking for a great area to feel like you are away from the city without going to far this is the park.< /Text>

We did not use the camping or other park amenities; this rating is for the usage of the trails only.
From the top of the hill, you can enjoy panoramic views of the area, including the Sweetwater reservoir.<//review>

Antonio's Tires is awesome! I had my catalytic converter stolen, and most shops told me that there was nothing they could do because my car is pretty old. Ulises at Antonio's Tires led me in the right direction and gave me more options. It took a lot of phone calls, but we found a replacement converter! I don't know if I would've gotten my car back without them.</text>

This place is AWESOME! My boyfriend and i stumbled upon this shop and has been our shop ever since. Very efficient, great work and HONEST. Called to bring my sons car in for rear brakes. Took me even though it would go over closing time. Be careful who you take your car to. Take your car here. No place else. I'm serious. They even took a guy after they were closed because he needed work done right away. You won't be sorry. AND also, prices are very, very fair..< /Text>

<text>Antonio’s is the best place to take your car for either automotive work, tires and even muffler work, Antonio and his team are very nice and give out great customer service! I definitely recommend going to Antonio’s it’s the best shop around! I’ve gone multiple times to this shop for various needs even though I live in Hemet, and never have been disappointed!!!!</text><resp>None<//resp><Rating>5</Rating>< pics>

As a woman who does not know much about cars, it is extremely hard to find honest and reliable mechanics. Most mechanics want to take advantage of that, but not at Antonio's tire shop. Thank you guys for taking care of my car at a fair price. They genuinely care about their craft and service.</Text>

I highly recommend these guys. I went there because I thought I had a flat tire and it turned out to be the valve on my tired South that was faulty. They fixed it for me and didn't want to charge anything since it was a really quick fix. They are a really honest and highly recommended shop. I know where I'm going to buy my new tires< /review>

I have been coming here for years and I've had several cars serviced here. I've never had any problems. Great customer service and they really work with you when it comes to being on a budget. Anthony has worked on my cars as well as family members. Never dissapointed!< /review>

<response>None<//response><user_id>109453318469164908670<//user_id><text>I could hardly contain myself and could not wait for Omar to leave so I could write this review.

There have been few times in my life where I have been taken back when meeting a service provider. This is one of those cases.

When Omar showed up he was on the phone with the home warranty company that I use speaking about my issue, the one I relayed to the company, before his arrival.

He told me all was going to be okay, but my garage spring is one that needs to be ordered due to it being custom. I understood.

The thing that stood out was his inquiries as to how the doors are acting, what they are doing and what they aren't doing. He was not up-selling me anything and he was direct and to the point.

There was no romance in the way in which he was presenting, it was just the facts with a constant reassurement the job will be done correctly when the spring arrives and he returns.

I'm glad to have met Omar from Safeway Garage Doors. The clincher, I have had other garage techs out here who wanted to sell me garage doors in a different configuration than I have. All to the cost of thousands of dollars. When I asked Omar, he said I have the best configuration and there is nothing wrong with the garage doors I have. They are in great shape.

Refreshing for sure.< /text>< pics>

Bunch of crooks! We had same issue twice - came though First American home warranty to replace broken garage spring and claimed we need new cables and that is not covered. Charged us $150 first time and later on home warranty got us the money back. Second time - same extortion with the same tech. Will be canceling all my six contacts and moving some place else<//Review>

I am apologize for the inconvenience it has caused you. There were several invoices from the separate trips we took to your home. That does not validate an excuse though, we were prepared to reimburse you the $75 that you would have been charged for. After speaking with the home warranty we cleared up all the confusion and ensured them that you do not need to be charged for your deductible as it was included in the upgraded unit you decided to purchase. We apologize for all of the chaos and headache you had to endure. It was not our intention to charge you $75 and have the home warranty charge you another $75. First American is well aware of this situation and has updated their records. If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to call.'}<//Response>< username>

<text>Do not trust this company. First American Home Warranty sent this company to fix/change my garage door opener. I paid 750$ for their services and the home warranty fee (75$) was included in the payment, however they are denying it and the home warranty sent me a bill for a 75$ fee which I already paid. See the picture of the receipt I posted on yelp. This is Fraud. I have been dealing with this for few weeks now and I’m not getting anywhere. Do not give any business to Safeway Garage Doors.
PLEASE DO NOT TRUST THIS COMPANY. They lied to me. They tried to overcharge an innocent customer. They called me and tried to apologize and asked me to remove my comment but I told them I wrote it so others do not fall into their trap. Trust me, I would never use them again and do not recommend them</text>< user_id>

Total crooks.  Paid home warranty $75 copay for these crooks to come out.  Then they charged $440 to put garage door back on track.  Charged $149 for cables that sell for $7.49 cents on Amazon Prime.  Wanted $200 for new wheels that sell for $24 on Amazon Prime.< /text>

My technician, Nick, was very professional, courteous and informative.  He basically had to replace the whole garage door opener but took the time to explain everything to me so I understood why I needed the whole thing replaced.   He was fast and completely left my garage cleaned up like he wasn't even here.  I really appreciate the work he did and will recommend him to my family and friends in the future.<//text>

Rocky at Safeway garage doors was the most knowledgeable out of three vendors that came out for an evaluation. Not only is he skilled in troubleshooting and providing solutions, he also did the installation. From start to finish, his professionalism made it a pleasant experience. I would highly recommend him and Safeway Garage doors for your garage door needs.<//review>

Rocky from Safeway Garage Doors came over the day after I called.  He was on time and super personable. He showed us why our garage door would not open and what it would take to fix it. He also suggested some other door opener maintenance which we agreed to. His work was well done and he had us open the garage door to make sure we were satisfied.

Super satisfied.</Review>

I've had terrible experience with my home warranty contractors, sent out to do repairs.  Yesterday Rocky from Safeway Garage Doors  sent by my home warranty service, was out to repair my garage door opener.  Rocky was timely in showing up for the repairs, diagnosed the problem and fixed the door opener in less than an hr.  His professionalism  and workmanship was superior to most contractors that I've had the opportunity to work with. His employer should be proud to have him as their employee.  Keep up the good work Rocky.<//Text>

<review>I wanted to give it 4.5 stars but it won't let me do that.

Pros: on time (early even), friendly, knowledgeable, respectful, and reasonably priced

They weren't able to fix my issue, but they tried everything they could think of before calling it.

Cons: the only real negative was that they didn't call 1/2 he before showing up as they promised. It was a minor thing this time, but could be more impactful in other circumstances.

**I am amending my review after getting a second opinion from another company. The tech from the second company knew within 30 seconds what the issue was and fixed it by replacing an inexpensive part. No replacement of the opener was needed. While the rep from Safeway was friendly, on-time, and respectful, I am now questioning how knowledgeable and professional they are.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< rating>

Rocky even took the time to show me what he did to fix it, in case it happens again.

I would recommend Safeway Garage Door service to everyone. My door stopped working and eventually came crashing down breaking its glass. Rock the rep came and figured out right away how it’s missing the key cables to hold the door. He fixed the broken spring, installed new cables and even did the recommended maintenance inspection on it. He was very courteous and knowledgeable in the field of his expertise. Thank you Rocky for sharing enough knowledge with me too so in future I’ll be able to determine what I need fixed on the door and where the problem lies. Wow, my door is now 50% quieter!! Thank you for your time and effort 👍🏼<//Review>

Terrible experience I don't recommend the Service to anyone.  The employee who came to fix the garage door was so rude.  He had attitude and he seemed to he hate his job.  Towards the end he was giving me instructions on how to set up the pin code for the garage remote. I was trying and it didn't work, he got frustrated, I told him that you probably do this all day long So it's probably easy for , I'm trying my best please be patient.  Then he snapped and said DO YOU WANT ME TO DO OT FOR YOU i said no because i dont want anyone to know our garage door pin code.

At the end of The Visit the employee had even more attitude where he turned around and looked at me and a THREATENING way because he sensed that i was not happy with his service.  SHOCKINGLY we ended up yelling at each other, i got really Nervous to have a strange man acting like that inside my home.  I am a mom of two who had never ever had to experience anything like that before .. I nice and my sister were standing behind the door listening to the argument and they couldn't believe it SHOCKINGLY he started cussing me so I have to kick him out of the house.

I contacted the company manager and i am going to reach out to the company owner to report this guy.  Lets see what happens.</Text>

They took care of a warranty problem we had with our rototiller easily and with concern. They are a great local business to go to when you need help.</text>

Don’t go there they charged me more to repair an item than it was worth. Rather that fixing the trimmer they replaced any and all parts and charged 40% more than I would have paid for the same parts direct from the dealer. I was upset when I left at the hefty price tag so I did not look at the trimmer until I got home. At that point I discovered they jury rigged the throttle cable to carburetor. Not sure how you can get something that simple screwed up but they did. I had to drive 15 miles to get them to correct their mistake. My advise stay away unless you like wasting money and are ok with poor service and communication from these guys.</Text>

< Review>
I took my weed eater to see if there was a way to repair the small gas tank to Mike and his Sharpening Shop. He told me he had some plastic repair compound that could fix the small crack on the gas tank. I also explained to him that the weed eater was kind of stubborn to get started sometimes. He said he would check it out. I asked him for an estimate on the repairs and told me he would call me with one in a few days. About 3 weeks past and I called his shop to see what was going on with the repair. The girl that answered told me that it would be over a month before they could get to checking my weed eater. She called me later that same day and told me that there technician checked the weed eater and found out that the carburetor was malfunctioning and that there is no parts available for it. She explained that there was a $45 inspection fee. This shop used to be my go to shop for lawn mower repairs. But now it seems there just not interested in making repairs. They already knew that there are no parts for my weed eater, I had taken it to them before and they had told me this. All I needed was to patch the gas tank. It seems there not interested in doing small repairs anymore. I feel they will be going the way of Justus Lawnmower in downtown Turlock, it’s just sad.<//Review>

I'm not big on writing reviews but this needs to be known. I ordered some parts from the Sharpening Shop in February and it took over 6 weeks for me to get them. I understand that things take some time but when I called to see how long the parts were going to take they were rude and not very helpful to me at all. I felt like I wasn't important to them that my business didn't matter. I deal with different parts places all the time and have never had a problem like this before. I was very disappointed in how long it took and how I was treated< /text>

I have purchased from here previously with same issues  but I thought of giving it another
Try . But again Less then 2 week  from purchase  and had to bring  back 2 pieces of lawn equipment back due to not working properly.  Seems they make their  money  on fixings things they just sold  With the 7 day return policy .2 weeks is about the time problems start .</Review>

This place is so clean and every employee that I dealt with (there was 3) was so polite and helpful and friendly.  I will drive a little farther and out of my way to go to this place.<//Review>

the cashier was rude, poor customer service treated me like a bum. overall have nothing against 76 as a whole just this shop never going there again, better to go to the other gas station next to it than dealing with there bs.</Review>

I put one star, just because there no lower options. I went to this office during this pandemic, so obviously there is no face to face contact. Only security was there, who instruct me that I suppose to put my ssc, ID and my work permit !originals! - grate, there lost it. 👌
They were supposed to send it back to my address, but I never got it back. Called them, no one could tell me what happened and scheduled to call me back, which they also never did.< /text>

<text>The only reason im giving this place 1 star ia because the guard was nice, how can this place be called what it is and do not provide social social security cards? Should say on the website or on maps. Good thing i have a car< /text>< pictures>

<Text>My husband and I were extremely satisfied with the service we receive at this center. The service representatives are knowledgeable & friendly, and the wait time is not inconvenient. Because of our positive experience with this office, we only use the La Mesa office for our social security and medicare needs. Furthermore, we had to interact with several members of their staff and each time was more than satisfactory. If we could give more stars, we would. Great Job!

I never thought that I would review a Social Security office, but after our treatment by the security guard today I felt it was warranted.  This office is usually friendly as well as providing prompt service.  The security guard there this morning was less than pleasant or welcoming.  I was helping my Mother-In-Law run errands, one of which happened to be a quick stop at Social Security.  In tow is my 3 year old grand daughter.  My Mother-In-Law stood in line, with two people ahead of her, I sat down with my grand daughter.  She's learning to read and so she was reading everything around her.  We were there for all of about 3 minutes when the guard comes over and tells me that I have to keep her quiet...Seriously??!! There are people on cell phones, talking louder than her. The notices posted say that children have to be supervised, which she was, sitting in her seat, not running around, not pestering anyone...she was reading.  We decided to just go walk around outside because we really didn't feel welcomed there at all.  5 minutes later my Mother-In-Law is done.  So, for all of about 10 minutes tops, this guard couldn't stand to listen to a 3 year old read, not scream, not run around, not pestering anyone.  Please, hire someone who has a little more common sense...maybe someone with a personality.  The man never even said hello.  The only words he spoke were to ask to see inside my purse and to tell me to keep my grand daughter quiet.<//review>

This Social Security office staff (especially Jarod and Dennis) are professional, friendly and very helpful.  Their operation is quite efficient, the waiting room is comfortable and clean, and my brother and I found it extremely easy--even gratifying--to take care of our Social Security business there.  We had an appointment, which I recommend making on-line, but even the walk-ins were treated professionally and efficiently.<//review>

<Text>Came here on Wednesday about 30 minutes before closing time with my parents (yes, we are the worse kind, but its a complicated story). Then were still willing to help and call someone to help them with translation. One guy was a bit rude but the others were more understanding. Overall given that they fit us in and helped I'm happy.<//Text></record>

<text>got an official appointment and asked an official employee a specific question about my  retirement.  he said i collect on the day i turn 65 and circled the 65 saying that was the golden number.  since i only had 36 quarters at the time i asked if he was sure that i didn't need to work another 4 quarters to qualify.  he told me i was eligible at 65 and 36 quarters would be enough.  he lied, and he was incompetent, i just found out that i need 40, the original question i made the appt for.  dumb idiot i didnt feel right about him, loser</text>< name>

My parents went for an appointment there.  The Asian lady employee was extremely rude.  She looked at us as if we are dumb because we set an appointment there instead of chula vista.  She keep on bringing it up.  Why does she have such a big problem that we set an appointment there.  she continued to be rude throughout the appointment.   She gives the SSA a bad reputation.</Text>

<UserId.>108778297792924196425< /UserId.><time>1459965760078< /time><review>I am comparing this walk-in visit to the La Mesa office, yesterday the 5th of April, with 2 previous walk-in visits this past September (2015) and February of this year to the San Bernardino office located at 605 N. Arrowhead Dr. in the city of San Bernardino. When I arrived, I was greeted by a helpful Security Officer explaining this office's process. In the San Bernardino office however, I was not able to be greeted by a Security Officer until I waited (with others) for 60 minutes outside the building, in 90° heat with no seating available for anyone, ELDERLY INCLUDED. When I checked into, and received a number for La Mesa office, my initial wait to speak with a professional and polite employee providing me the forms to begin filling out was under 10 minutes. At the San Bernardino office however, the wait to check in and receive a number was 45 minutes, AND another 30 minutes to see someone at a window and begin the "why I'm there" wait. I had a seat in the lobby of the La Mesa office with 10 others waiting to be helped. San Bernardino lobby was over-flowing with approximately 80 (or more?) people waiting for help. I was called to the window in La Mesa office, was met with both a professional and helpful representative and was on my way within 30 minutes total. I had an additional 60 minute wait in San Bernardino to meet with a representative (both visits). While the customer service was comparable in both offices for walk-in visits, I WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE AN APPOINTMENT for San Bernardino office, and I can't guarantee that your wait will be "short."</review><rating>5</rating>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
I have been coming here for 25 years, and it is my all time favorite place, however it truly is for people who live in this area, not necessarily ideal for people not from the area.</Review>

Hard to get full experience because of Covid protocols but not their fault. Food seemed close to home made, good selections. Could have more selections in salsa. They cleared out our food while we were still working on it and started wiping down the table lol.< /Text>

I have been a major fan of this place for years!  Today's visit was no different.  I appreciated their COVID-19 precaution: table spacing, outdoor seating option, plexiglass barriers between booths, sealed condiments, etc.  As always, the food was on point and super quick.  Friendly staff and good service have always been a staple.  I would recommend this place for anyone wanting some great Mexican Food!  I would also suggest that you try the soups - they're great.  Also, try the "Mexican Parrillada" if you are with someone that you don't mind eating off the same plate as.</Review>

The soups beef stew and the pizole are delicious and gigantic - Definitely a meal by themselves.  You don't see this specialty in most other places. I did not try any other food here so can't comment. The staff were kind, welcoming and informative on the menu, but service was a little slow tonight.  This was likely due to being understaffed as it looked, and the server pathway between the kitchen and dining rooms are awkwardly designed for the max distance to opposite sides of the building.< /Text>

My husband introduced me to La Especial Norte 14 years ago when we first started dating, and now still married yeats later. He has been going there many years before. Now over 1 year later, you have no idea how much we missed you guys! Yummmm!  Your salsa & chips, coffee, mexican steak & eggs, and your friendly service absolutely wonderful! Thank you to all of you as we begin to get back to some normalcy. Highly recommend!< /text>

Such a long overdue review!
The food was a solid 4 stars, the service was a good 5 stars easy. We went to celebrate a birthday and the birthday boy said it was really good but he has had better steaks elsewhere. We had never been to the establishment and wanted to give it a try.

Parking sucks, its SF.</Text>

<Text>We stopped here for an early dinner after taking a walk on the beach. We arrived at 5:15 pm and there were plenty of tables to choose from. Within 30 minutes the place was packed.

Our server was great, and took our drink and food orders quickly. The food arrived really quick!

The food was delicious and the amount of food was incredible, given the low prices.

We'll definitely be back many times.</Text>< Pictures>

I haven't been to this place in many, many years. I moved 4 years ago, but was back in Cali visiting my mom, son, daughter in law, and friends. The prices have sky rocketed $15-20  per dish. You get one small basket of chips for 4 people, and the chips at the bottom were all broken. If you want more chips it's $2.00 extra. It didn't matter if you are eating alone or with 4 people the basket of chips was the same size. Black beans $1.00 extra. They said they use the same size shrimp for all dishes. We got 3 different dishes of shrimp and they were all different sizes the shrimp. You ask the waitress and she says I am just following the rules. The service was so slow. You had to ask for refills. The food was ok not the best. There are so many other Mexican restaurant that is better food, and doesn't care if you want another basket of chips. The total bill for 4 people was over $80.00. My mom talked to the manager when we left because as we were walking out this table had one person sitting there and there chips was piled high for one. They told us if there is  1-2 people you get less chips. 3-4 you get a full basket. That was not true. Very disappointing,, and I will not go back. They changed their policy a few months the waitress said..The manager said we should have asked for him and not just taken the waitress word for the new rule. What?!?! That's crazy.</review>

<text>Came here on a Thursday for lunch. It's an institution in ENCINITAS I suppose, been here since 1977, so I had higher expectations. Fairly decent crowd so many must like it. I was underwhelmed.
From the start, the salsa was average at best, probably not homemade, really basic, not spicy and too tomatoe-y, but salsa is never ever that bad, so I digress.
The carne asada burrito combo was not great. Every bit of vegetable, peppers, onions and especially the lettuce looked days old and very wilted. The lettuce was frankly pretty close to brown as was the avocado.
Then on the side is a scoop of, I guess,  some sort of slaw. Again, pretty wilty looking.
I was quite surprised I had to ask for some hot sauce, tapatio, cholula, etc. None of any sort on any of the tables.
Service was fairly prompt and courteous. Price is reasonable if only a little fresher ingredients.< /text></record>

<Review>Restaurants in the Encinitas area generally have a hard time making it. This restaurant has been in the same spot for 30+ years. That in itself tells you everything.<//Review>< pictures>

< Review>
A very nice place in Leucadia.  Old school Mexican decor made me feel at home like the Mexican restaurants when I was a kid.   Great food and generous portions.  I did not try any of their soups but they offer a large variety, served in huge bowls for a mean in itself.  Prices are very reasonable, especially for lunch during the week until 3 PM.</Review>

Ahhhhhh Wurstküche is a gem!!!! Oncce i had one of their dogs, I couldn't go back to eating any other! They're sooooo good & what's more is that they have quite a few options of the type of sausage you can get! We LOVE options - that's when you know it's good whEn you have trouble deciding what to get! Spent a good ten minUtes debating with self on which sausage to get and what drink to get too. But any which one you get is sure to be a winner. I got the Italian one and split one of their vegan dogs with a friend. Wowowowow- just wow! These boys are BIG so expect to be filled after one.. we had fries too! Oh and don't skip out on the sauces either! They're floating about on tables nearby. The place itself is pretty roomy, but with crowdds- can be a challenge to find seating! There is an outdoor area to have a seat too. Overall, this place is great and will make a return very soon !!!</Review>

The Molcajete was awesome, but the rest of the experience was lackluster. It was loud, with some screamy children. Another person in my party ordered a beer and it never came, even though our mixed drinks did. Service was slow, but otherwise nice.< /text>

Good food, service, prices and drinks. Supper cute decorations and cozy family feel! Chips were hot right out of the kitchen. Loved the purple Cadillac margarita for $8.50 was a steal! Chimichanga combo filled me up, I took half home and wasn’t greasy. Can’t wait to come back and try more items from their menu.< /Text>

We Came to try this place because we heard it was really good.  Food looked presentable but my 8 year old got sick for 3 days. We bought a brand new Car and on the Car ride home he threw up all over the backseat. Cost me a pretty penny to get it detailed. Not only that he threw up the rest of the day I had to stay up till 4am so he didn't Choke on his vomit the first night. He missed 3 days of school thanks guys!< /review>

Great for the chicken tortilla soup. Other food items to order at Norte are the shrimp burrito,

I live nearby and eat here fairly regularly because my wife and kids like the chicken soup and chili rellenos, which are very good. However, it's rare that I leave feeling like I had a great food experience. On my last visit, my food was luke-warm (the cheese in my cheese enchilada was not melted thoroughly) and my beef taco was so soggy I had to eat it with a fork and knife. Their policy of charging $2 for additional baskets of chips is not in line with other restaurants in the area. The staff is wonderful, but I feel like there's some QC work to be done in the kitchen.</Text>

I have been eating at this place for the past 20 years and the place is always delicious. One of the better Mexican restaurants around Encinitas. They have the best soups in town!<//text>

The menu had entertaining descriptions of their soups. The only downside of my experience was the service was a little slow (we ordered waters and received them half way through the meal, he must of forgot) and the seating was crammed.</Review>< pictures>

<review>One person in our group got food poisoning. That aside, some dishes had potential flavor-wise but honestly, overall it was mediocre at best and the portions were way too big/ greasy. Limited options for vegetarians - the rice is cooked in chicken broth and the guacamole tasted like it was made with rotten avocados.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dc0cf73e285b1f:0x68ba24ef607ea8ad< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The food was good.  We've come here at least once a year for the last 30 years. I was adisappointed that they charged us 2$ for a second basket of chips.  We were a party of 4 and everyone ordered entrees.  Overall we are always happy with our experience.< /Review>

<review>The tortilla soup was amazing, but the burrito was just okay. I was a little sad that they only give one free basket of chips, since 50 percent of the reason I opt to go to a Mexican restaurant is to eat unlimited chips.

It seemed like every other patron had soup, so I will definitely stick to that next time.</review>< Pics>

<Text>OMG, my boss took the back office here for part of our Christmas gift.
Wow! There was 7 of us. She ordered an something which none of us really paid attention to, she is the boss and paying....we thought she was  ordering our lunch. When it came..There was so much food and we had been eating the chips, salsa and guacamole.
Then a Bigger platter came...it was Huge!
The food is so good. The meat tender and juicy. The soup, tortillas. Everything is so good. I don't know what she ordered, but this one had, pork, chicken, beef, guacamole, tortillas. Flour and corn. Well worth it!

Holy Moly. My buddy treated me to this amazing place. I have Mexican family members who are astounding cooks. This place made me feel at home. Hands down the best Chile Relleno I've ever had. And, believe me, I have had some of the finest this planet has to offer as I travel throughout all of California and northern Mexico on a regular basis. Thank you so much for your dedication to the craft La Especial Norte. Well done.<//review>

<Review>Great little local place, terrific food! Customer service can be a little on the slow side.   I think if they came up to check on your more often that would be nice. Otherwise not too bad, but the food is phenomenal... The mechiladas are the bomb!!  The only thing I would change here is make an outdoor patio for dining, and definitely a sit down bar would bring in a lot more money and make it easier for those of us that just wanna go have a couple of drinks and some chips and not feel obligated to order from the menu or take up seating.< /Review>< Pics>

We chose off the lunch specials, it was delicious and the price was good! I ordered the red snapper and it came with a small chicken soup. The soup was delicious but unfortunately i cannot handle even a little spicy so i could not eat the snapper. It was ok though, i took it to my mom and ordered a big bowl of the chicken soup 😉. My brother got the meatball soup and tacos and loved it.< /review>

One of the best Mexican sit down restaurants I have ever been to.. they've got pretty much everything under the sun to choose from and the prices are extremely cheap for what you get. The portions are huge and the staff here are extremely friendly. Our family come here frequently with very large groups some times and they always accommodate us. Thank you la especial Norte for the continued excellent dining experience 😊 we will continue to come back 😁

Just as a heads up they don't take reservations and it's a first-come first-serve seating when you get there because they are so good and too busy and I mean this restaurant is big but they're so popular that most of the time you can expect a 15 to 30 minute wait to be seated so it's always good to have somebody go out ahead and get your position inline if you plan to go during busy times 😉<//Text>

Fajita dinner did not come out of the kitchen on a sizzling cast iron plate. Food was not hot. The dish cost $17 and had the smallest amount of beef for a fajita dinner that I've ever seen (I've been ordering fajita dinners for over 30 years). We had to pay $2 for the chips (they are generally included with dinner).<//text>

<text>Best place to go for homemade soups and family style meals. Order the Parrillada "Especial" for 2 and it will be enough for 4 or 5 people. Only $26, its the best price for your money in North County San Diego.

Mexican food is made for family style meals and this place has nailed it. When my family visits from AZ, this is the first stop for them.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dc0cf73e285b1f:0x68ba24ef607ea8ad<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Authentic class Mexican restaurant in Leucadia. No Frills - the margaritas are strong, the food is delicious. The prices are good, portions are shareable. Very filling.

Solid food at a reasonable price!
Our first time to eat here, and we are asking ourselves WHY!!! Definitely coming back! Tip, the house margarita is really good, better than the more expensive Cadillac margarita. Awesome pork Verde and the sauce on the enchiladas was scrape the plate good. Can't wait to go back and try the seafood.</review>

<review>Nice place, standard type setting, servers could have been more attentive, was only brought one drink for the whole meal.  Was with a big group, but that shouldn't deal us out of good service... Still leaving it at 4 because food was good.</review><Time>1543284382660< /Time><user>107330063111012365328</user><gmapID>0x80dc0cf73e285b1f:0x68ba24ef607ea8ad< /gmapID>< Pictures>

The service and the food is very good. You can actually order one dinner and share it. They give you so much. There is a parking problem but that's because they are busy.<//Review>

We were on vacation and looking for somewhere to eat near our hotel in Encinada, CA. I opened up Google maps and asked for restaurants nearby. This had 4.5 stars and 1 $. We're loved it. Good Mexican food for a decent price. We're got there about 30 min before closing but no one batted an eye. They were kind and treated my kids well. We were fed and out in 45 minutes (which was amazing to me!). 👍👍(two thumbs up)< /Text>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Good food, good prices and large serving sizes. The only drawback is if you are a large group like we were (about 16 to 18 people), they will not give individual or family checks. Only one bill for all of our group to divvy up into what we owed. Longer serving time since there were so many of us (we made a reservation a few days earlier so they knew we were all coming). Some people were almost finished before others were even served. Staff was friendly and helpful. We would go back again, but with a smaller group.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

I have been going here for years and nothing has changed. Still the same amazing food, attentive service, and fun decor. The fresh chips and salsa are great, and  Their soups are to die for. My favorite is the black bean soup. It is so simple with just black beans, avocado, and onion. But it surprises me every time.<//review>

They have a new manager.  I got the veggie burrito.  It comes with lettuce and cabbage shredded carrots, and cheese.  I asked for no cheese, add beans and found a few in one corner.  It was served dry with a little sprinkle of cheese on top.   The small basket of chips costs two dollars to refill.  The salsa was excellant.  With so many Mexican choices, I wont be going here again.<//Text>

Shrimp in the cocktail was gray, slimy and tasted like food poisoning. We sent it back. The cheese in the cheese enchiladas was not even melted and the sauce was really heavy.

Amazing Mexican! Chicken soup was tasty, hot and flavorful. Shrimp burrito was overflowing with shrimp and hot until the last bite. Food came out so quickly!! Will definitely be back!< /Review>

We ate here after a long day on the beach. Normally any and all Mexican food tastes so good after being in the sun all day, but this one didn't. It was really flavorless.  I also had a really hard time getting drinks. They got them pretty quick once I got their attention, but that was hard to do. I understand they were busy, but it just added to the "meh" factor of the experience. I wouldn't go back.</Text>

If you don't eat here....  you will have missed out on some of the best food ever. The taco/burrito combo was so good I nearly overdosed on pleasure... An it was such a large serving I didn't finish it till the next day.. 😁 the people serving us were very friendly an made us feel special. Really a place to treat your taste buds. 🤗<//Review>

<Text>An established award-winning joint that goes beyond the usual taco, burrito, enchilada. They specialize in delivering authentic dishes from several different regions of Mexico.  Their soups are fantastic and there are about a dozen to choose from.

The restaurant had three large group reservations and they were not properly staffed.  It took about 20 minutes for anyone to approach us to serve us water and when we needed service, we had to physically call someone to our table.  The food was well prepared, but nothing exceptional for Mexican food.< /review>

<review>BEST CHICKEN SOUP IN ENCINITAS! Man-oh-man, if you're hankering for REAL Mexican food, this is Dave & Tammy Tour's Go-To Mexican dinner. We both got a cold last winter and coincidently went here for dinner. We ordered the soup, were blown away, and ever since, whether it's a cold Encinitas night, we get a bit under-the-weather, or just want some "comfort food" this is one of our spots. Parking can be a challenge, but just plan to walk a block or two. It's worth it.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

We ordered our food for take out, asada tacos just meat and cheese, 2 asada burritos beans rice cheese and salsa and a cheese quesadilla. Every thing we ordered was wrong except the quesadilla, everything had guacamole and someone in your group is allergic, one burrito came as wet and the other had melted cheese on top with almost no meat, the tacos had tons us guac we didn’t ask for or want and all the tortillas were stale and nasty. The only thing that’s tasted good was the salsa and chips. And this all cost $55... way to expensive for the nasty food that wasn’t prepared how we ordered it.</Review>

<review>Great service, great steak. My stuffed chilies came wrapped in some type of tomato paste that I was not a fan of, and the cheese seemed dry and cakey (was supposed to be Monterrey Jack). Free chips and salsa are great tasting.
Stick with the meat dishes. Beans and rice are awesome as well.</review><Gmap_id>0x80dc0cf73e285b1f:0x68ba24ef607ea8ad< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

<text>La NOT Especial - My wife and I ate here a couple weeks ago on our way to a concert.  We had to stop at Walgreens for Tums and gum before the concert :(.  I had chicken soup, which as good and the only reason I'm giving 2 stars.  The meal was nothing but greasy starch.</text>< Gmap_id>

Just the best Mexican food in a 10 mile radius. For southern California that amounts to a lot of competition. Soups are perfect, mole is rich and complex, and Chile rellenos are tasty alone but the red sauce they add is the best I've ever had.< /Text>

<review>We were asked to seat ourselves and it took about 7+ minutes to get coffee ordered. Another 10 min to order our food and get chips and salsa. After that service was friendly but didn't come around much after food was served. Good Ortega omelet and decent menudo. Some improvements on service would go a long way.</review><date>1524423540865<//date><name>Richard Moran<//name></record>

<text>The restaurant is one of our favorites.  Really good Mexican food but some fundamentals and consistency in service are missing.  The servers do not introduce themselves and we don’t get asked how our food or if we need refills on our drinks.  Would help improve our experience.</text>< Rate>

<review>Thank god I didn’t walk here because it took  half and hour to get  water. When they did, it was the best tasting thing I had. The chips were flavorless and the salsa was nothing to write home about. The guacamole was bland and covered in Kraft Mexican Cheese. The “nachos” were dog food covered slices of cardboard with more flavorless guacamole. I think the nachos will look better tomorrow in the toilet bowl then they looked tonight. Now onto the main course. The main course was okay, but again, nothing to write home about. The presentation looked like it was prepared by a bird with IBS. And, for all of this horrible food, which mostly went to waste, it cost upwards of $100 dollars. The only reason you would go to this place is for an drunken snack. It is sad that a Mexican restaurant this close to the boarder would taste like diarrhea. Hopefully when it comes out the other side, it is not as painful as when I was shoveling it down my gullet just to keep myself from being hangry.</review><user_name>Dominic DiLuzio</user_name><date>1534653535290<//date><Pictures>None</Pictures><gmapID>0x80dc0cf73e285b1f:0x68ba24ef607ea8ad< /gmapID>< user_id>

<text>With all the new craft/urban and pricey lemonade restaurants popping up every where coming and going. It makes me happy to see a family owned restaurant still in business for over 20-40 years? I don't remember the exact year they started their business, but even so their prices are still reasonable and on top that their food is good.

They provide genuine service here and these days its hard to find good service.

I love me a good broth and their Los Caldo's don't lie. It is full of flavor and very hearty. So, before you order tacos also try the soups! Chicken first!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80dc0cf73e285b1f:0x68ba24ef607ea8ad<//gmap_id></record>

By far the worst Mexican  restaurant  I have ever eaten at ordered the Fuentes de mariscos and was horribly displeased it came with no tostadas at all so I asked for some chips because being an often eater of Mariscos aka seafood everyone eats them with either tostadas or chips well I got charged for chips would love to know how you guys have such great reviews but then realized you have no Hispanic customers very good for Americanized Mexican food beans were bland and your guys ceviche needs a bunch of work and your margarita was more like a shot</text>

I've been going to Le special Norte for many years. If you want a place to eat that feels truly like you're in Baja California Mexico this is the place and great food!... staff is friendly. There's a little bar to the left as soon as you have entered the restaurant . 🍻 ( great margaritas )They have booths in the front of the restaurant to the right and a big room in the back with quite a bit of seating. Again it feels just like you're in Baja!.... enjoy yourself have fun!.... out of country experience without going out of the country. Again the staff is very nice good people!....</Text>

<text>Super greasy... chilaquiles were unappetizing, sloppy cut chips in a green sauce, everything was glossy with grease. The waitress was not helpful or pleasant.
Bummer, because with all the years it's been here, one would expect more authentic food and better service.< /text>< pics>

The main draw here, of course, is the chicken tortilla soup.  Service is sometimes good, sometimes mediocre.  Staff is always friendly.  We usually order takeout and always feel better after the soup.< /Review>

<review>It took an hour and thirty five minutes to get the food and it was not good.
I used to like this place a lot.
Service was horrible, it took 25 minutes before chips and salsas served.
The food didn't taste the same as I always.
They didn't offer apology or anything

Wow talk about bad service!!! Sitting here for 15 minutes no drinks, no one to let us that they would be with us in a moment:/
The ambience is nice, salsa is not authentic.. tastes like Pace Picante sauce. After flagging down one the workers, we were attended to 25 minutes later. Service is Key to me as that is one of the keys to repeat customers. Although they have many locals here.. If your an out of Towner I would look elsewhere.<//Text>

< review>
La Especial Norte has been around forever and has always had a reputation for featuring some traditional dishes not commonly found on most Mexican restaurant menus.
I learned the hard way that most of these dishes like the Molcajete, strips of beef or chicken, baby cactus a special sauce on sizzling hot stone bowl, are not on the lunch menu.
I still had a nice lunch.

What I ate....

Shrimp Cocktail ~ Shrimp, avocado, hot sauce, cucumber, onion, cilantro

This is one of my favorite dished and I always order one if a restaurant offers it. Their version was good with a balance of all the ingredients.

Chicken Soup ~ Shredded chicken, avocado, tomato, rice, cilantro

Note ~ The stock had a lot of depth of flavor.

Chicken Mole ~ Shredded chicken, mole, rice, and beans.

Note ~ Good mole is hard to find, when done right it almost has a spicy earthiness to it. Their mole is very good.

I will have to go back for dinner to try the larger menu, still the lunch deals are very good ~ Entree w / rice and beans, Drink, Cup of chicken soup, and cabbage salad for $8.50< /review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>Wouldn't go back if you paid me! This place has good ratings so we stopped for dinner. The waitress was awkward, she looked at me crazy when I asked for queso, I ordered a margarita and had it sent back because there were huge chunks of ice in it. She assumed I wanted shredded beef when I said beef tacos ( I wanted beef fajita) order came out wrong. The shrimp was cold, soup had no flavor. Oh and she forgot my side of shredded cheese. $65 down the drain!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<review>Get the chicken soup,  I didn't. I've tried the enchiladas, a chile relleno, fish tacos and a shredded beef taco that looked suspiciously like an enchilada (maybe she thought that's what I said)?  I can't recommend anything other than the chicken soup and cheese crisp. (That's what my dad gets every time)   The salsa and chips on the table are good too though. He wants to go back for tamales this weekend.    I'll let you know how they are 😉< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

One of the best Mexican restaurants. The food is authentic and they have a HUGE menu. My favorites are the soups, the octopus with garlic and the carnitas.< /review>

Proof that you can get awful Mexican food in San Diego. The servers had no pride in the food at all and it is clear why. We tried multiple things. No flavor. They boil all their seafood! With no seasoning. Crazy bad. Waiter was absent and incoherent. Upon leaving our plates were filled with food. The waiter acknowledged the food was bad yet still did not offer to fix anything. Instead they recommended we come back and try something they do well like soup. We did try the pozole. It was still on the table when he said that. It sucked too.<//Text>< Rate>

Came here for breakfast.  Good service.  Good portions  Now the bad and this is just preference but huevos rancheros should not be made with over easy eggs.  The flour tortillas were big but were doughy, again a preference. The salsa is good and the home fries came with lots of onions which I liked. Overall ok.< /text>

< Review>
This is a wonderful Mexican restaurant located on the "original" coast highway in the northernmost part of Encinitas, actually closer to being in Leucadia. The food is very good, although I have had equally good Mexican dishes elsewhere. The service is very friendly and fast. The parking lot is VERY limited in size to you may have a bit of trouble with that.

They have a dish that I really, really love and that is hard to find elsewhere: Milanesas. This is where they bread and fry a tenderized piece of flank steak or chicken breast and serve it with salsa and chopped cilantro over it. THAT is a great entree! For even more milanesa goodness, ask them to cover it with enchilada sauce and grated cheese. Muy sabroso!</Review>

This was nothing special. Albondigas soup was pretty good, but the enchilada suiza was dry/bland. Chips were kind of hard/flavorless. Salsa was spicy. Margarita was okay.</text>

Hadn't been in a few years, called in an order, was told it would be 15-20min. Arrived 20 minutes later to no order ready, ten minutes later I was met on the front bench with my order. Arrived at home to a California burrito with no guacamole as requested and paid for, and two BRC burritos with no rice... it'll be another few years before I go back...😥🤨<//review>

I came here for dinner with a group of friends. We started off with the chicken tortilla soup and it was reallyyy good. I had the carne asada for the entrée and I thought it was ok. I've had better but I was pretty satisfied overall. The décor inside was very festive. However, in the booth that we were seated in there were a line of ants so that wasn't really cool.</text>

(Translated by Google) One of the few Mexican restaurants with real Mexican flavor 😋
A single observation, the Tlalpeño Broth very rich but the original one has white rice and cheese on it 😁 but still, delicious!
