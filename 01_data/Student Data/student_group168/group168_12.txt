Went in for a pedicure and I have heals that need to be scrubbed and filed the guy barely touched my heals and focused more on toenails and cuticles which weren’t in bad shape! I will not return and I will take my business back to ENVY.  I will say the atmosphere was relaxing. But, I did not get what I paid for..lesson learned</text>

< Review>
They do an awesome job with eyebrows and fullset nails and a great job with pedi's. The prices are decent but they take a lot of time to make sure it's done right. They take almost an hour to get a pedicure because they have these awesome chairs and they have the seaweed wrap for your calves and feet and they massage your feet and your your calves for you and it's an awesome place<//Review>

I've had the same nail person, Mai, for over 10 years, and I would follow her anywhere. She's amazing & the takes any salon she works at to the next level. She maintains a standard of excellence that I've never found with anyone else. The salon itself was bigger than I was expecting, but still had the 1 on 1 service that made it seem smaller. I already look forward to my next visit 😀</Review>

<Review>This place is in a great location what ever your beauty needs may be. CoCo nails can do mani and pedi needs, then there is Luxury Fades Barbershop where there are also licensed cosmotaligists for the ladies cuts, which even has a Certified Massage therapist inside, incase u need a little color in the summer but dont have time to layout stop by the stay golden salon and get ur tan</Review>< Time>

The staff is less than welcoming nowadays. Whoever the newer/younger guy is, I do not recommend. Did my nails quickly, but clearly too quickly since I received a low effort gel manicure. I chose a sparkly color and he left it PATCHY and even left the whole side of one of my nails unpainted. WORST looking gel manicure I’ve ever received. I used to be a regular at Gina’s and I haven’t gone anywhere else in at least 2 years; but I will not be returning at this point. Absolutely not worth the money and the embarrassing gel manicure. I cannot stress this enough.< /review>

Pros: Music is relaxing and not too much of an acetone smell.
Cons: staff is not welcoming, staff is not friendly, not only to customer, but also to each other. Van especially was ignorant and rude with rude gestures and comments. The place is not very clean and not sanitary.. I did not see them sanitizing tools between clients which is a great way to spread bacteria, nothing gets sanitized between clients, because of this, and rude service, I will not be coming back and do not recommend coming here. Also worst nail color job I've ever had...Pay a few bucks more to a place that cares about its clients and actually sanitizes their tools, scrubbers, basins, etc.!<//Text>

<Text>I would highly NOT recommend this place. I just got my nails done and not even a day later they felt loose and like they were coming off, she broke one of the nails and didn’t even fix it she just put the acrylic on over it. And they are not even close to flat, they have dents in them and left over acrylic on my fingers.</Text>< Pics>

<pics>None<//pics><review>Bad customer service. I signed in and a few minutes later they sat me in water for my pedicure. 45 minutes later I was still waiting. Instead of telling me upfront that there was a wait which would allow me to decide if I wanted to wait I was given false hope that I was going to be helped. When I was drying my feet off to leave someone  said "oh no someone will be right with you ". That's I was told 45 minutes earlier. I am very disappointed that my time was wasted. Don't seat your customers unless you intend to help them within a short time.</review><GmapID>0x809adf798e8dd223:0xe62681c43a8eff9b<//GmapID><rate>1<//rate>< user_id>

Do not recommend this nail salon, the "nail tech" filed my cuticle 3 times and didn't apologize, almost a week and it is still tender. I paid 10.50 shouldn't have expected more then a midiocure job for that price. Their electrical post about providing good customer service is flawed. All I wanted was my dip nails removed not my cuticles to be cut and still have dip powder on my nails. Thanks for the horrible removal.<//review>

Do not go to jon. He doesnt listen and he will tell you to leave if you dont like your nails. This place looks nice and you might have a couple of good visits but most visits will leave you unsatisfied. Not worth the money.< /text>

<text>Diana at this Solon did my pedi, she was amazing at making sure to not clip my toes nail to short and hurting me like another Solon had.  Great pedi. Hannah was very gentle with removing the acrylic off my nails. I have arthritis in my knuckles and they are very tender.  She did a great job.  Nice place.  Very clean.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
Today was my first visit to this place and I never go there again. The lady messed up with my manicure and looked so surprised when I told her I don't like it. She asked if I wanna leave some tips and when I said no, she was kind of disappointed. Will never recommend this place to anyone.<//Review>

<review>Had my nails done for the first time in a few years. Way to expensive for acrylic nails that they put a gel coat on at the end. And then charge u full price for gel nails. Also almost all my nails have bubbles in them there not clear at all.<//review>< pics>

<review>I normally  go there 2x a month. Never have had an issue until this time.
Apparently Nick is new there and it shows .  I have yet to go back to see if the issues can be fixed.
However either way, I will not be going back to Nick<//review>< pics>

< review>
I reserved a unit a couple of weeks before I needed it.  Unfortunately, the unit size I had reserved was not available when I showed up.  The staff was able to offer me a bigger unit at a great rate as an alternative.  I had never stored at a facility like this so it took some time to "get it" on how storage works in the city.  They have carts available for use, loading docks, freight elevators, and drive-in options for cars and mid-sized trucks.

My only concerns regarding this facility (and the reason for 4 stars and not 5) is that my access card did not allow me to exit the underground drive-in area with my card,  I had to use the call box each time.  It is a glitch with their system and I will update this review if the issue gets resolved.

The other issue is that their loading dock is not secure from a truck perspective...you need to have a spotter to keep an eye on your truck or lock it between each load...anyone could wander over from the nearby train tracks or road.  It's not a problem if you're prepared with a lock or spotter, just be aware.

Inside the facility is secure.  My unit felt very secure  inside the facility and protected from the elements.</review>

Their trucks are reliable and easy to drive,but I have a real issue with their storage hours. Website says one thing, but their storage facility aligns their hours with the office hours. Their weekend hours should be the longest,but they are the shortest. Weekends are always heavy and many people dump items because the don't have time to get the items into the storage they just rented. It's an injustice.<//text>

Representatives are mixed. Some are helpful. Some are unhelpful and rude. Generally, everything in the office is a slow and painful process.

Storage is units can be down a couple hallways in a warehouse. The free dollies are immensely helpful and appreciated!!

Renting a one-way truck took taking to three representatives just to be told “we cancelled your order.” That was an unfortunate use of an hour.

There “accessible hours” are not accurate for the warehouse storage area. Open at 7am, not 5am. Wasted a couple hours waiting one morning for access to my unit.

Overall recommendation is to avoid this place unless you are an exceptionally patient person.</text>

Easy peasy.. only weirdness was being asked, by a woman,  where my husband was.  Umm.. married to someone else now? I will tow my own trailer,  thank you.  And it's not my first rodeo..a woman who shows up with a class III hitch on her vehicle hopefully knows what she's doing.  Everyone helpful and safe...in and out in under 15 minutes.<//Text>

<Review>There is always a line to be waited on when I rent a rental vehicle. I reserved the truck online but still had to wait in line to be waited on. Other than that, the service was good & the rental equipment was decent.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808f857392b5516b:0x56bf4b163170ff20</Gmap_id></record>

This managger this manager behaves insolently and boldly took my rights in which the date of issue is written and said that they wrote the date of issue, although the date of issue is written in the document

he was behaves insolently rude, it is inappropriate for him to work as a manager in general . He dont afraid other witnesses customers he just screamed  and disrespect customer

<text>The worst uhaul experience in my life.  Called regional CHL for Oakland they scanned area and told me this location was the only one with an availability of the truck size I needed , went ahead and booked it , I got a confirmation email & text on Wednesday all's  good I'm thinking... Thursday morning @ around 10 30am I receive another confirmation from this location with a slight change in detail , I booked a 10 ft truck 2nd email said 10 ft Van . I called in to check & confirm that there were no changes to my reservation & the CS rep confirmed that it was a truck not van okay . Come the due date on the weekend I was 30 minutes late plus we waited another 30 minutes in line because it was busy , on arriving at counter we present the Reservation # & were told that the reservation had been canceled because we were an hr late so the truck is not available. ( unless you going to a VIP ball game or have a flight I've never known businesses to cancel a reservation after 1 hr especially car rentals after calling & confirming 😡😡😡😡 ... 1st time in my 3decades on planet earth .

Then the CS rep assisting us said they they had same truck availability for 1.30pm that very day so we agreed to reschedule  & left . @ 12:30pm I called to confirm the reservation and clarify if pick up time was 1pm or 1:30pm  CS clarified it for 1:30pm we headed back there @12:50 , where there before 1.30pm infact were at the service desk by 1.28pm  and they said the truck was not available,  CS couldn't find our reservation & needed to speak to manager? Manager told them to call the client who had the van , client said he hadn't emptied truck yet and wouldn't be  able to return it until 3pm . So all the $$ & resources spent with the back & forth could have been avoided with simple proffessionalism i.e poorly worded emails , confirming reservations for items not in your possession @ time aka double booking , & poor customer care service .

I've been a faithful customer but will never ever use this location again infact I was looking for different moving company other than Uhaul .<//text>< time>

I have two U-Haul stores closer to my residence, but keep coming back here because of the great service. With the exception of the young man who hold up the trailers, I have had different employees assist me each time, and each experience has been smooth and hassle free.  The trailer guy has gone above and beyond to make sure that the right is hooked up properly, and actually asked me to wait while he sources s better electrical connector. Someone else would have sent me it without the extra effort.

You may come here for your rental needs, but as far as I am concerned, this is MY store 😉!!!</text>

They don't deal with U-BOXES at that location, so they sent me to the U-HAUL on San Leandro St. They told me that the U-BOX had not even arrived yet from where it had been shipped. Total waste of time, what a joke.<//text>< Pictures>

<Review>This U-Haul facility is in a pretty skezy neighborhood by BART tracks and homeless encampments. With that said, the building is well maintained and the employees were extremely efficient and very helpful. It was the quickest rental and fewest problems I have experienced with a U-Haul to date. Thank you U-Haul of Oakland!< /Review><UserId.>104194135013965393845<//UserId.>< time>

They didn't want to give me a different truck had to wait  hours they told me they couldn't do nothing about it and had no replacement and I had bought the 30 dollar coverage road assistant for nothing. I ask if they coul take me to a different uhaul store they said no then I told then I wanted to rent another truck or van just to get to a different uhaul store they said they were all reserved. I did not believed them there were 7 truck and 7 vans out side. I had to take a uber to a different uhaul location to rent a truck. Worst place ever.<//Review><Resp>None<//Resp>< Rating>

<Text>Update: nope, knocking a star again. The fast swipe trick stopped working reliably, still have to fight with the box every time to get in. And they still keep shuffling unnecessary barricades around. Really hate this place...

Update 5/2019: they seem to have done something to fix the card reader... Or I just figured out a trick to make it work. Swipe the card as fast as humanly possible, and it works first try! I mean, swipe it like the Flash. Lightning fast. Then it works.

Still not the greatest experience. They keep changing barricades around the lot, making it confusing how to access the storage entrance, seemingly every month or so. This time, both entrances are open. Last month, only the railroad side one was open. Before that, only the mid-building entrance was open.

But it's secure, clean, and sensibly priced. I can't complain too much. The card swipe box was my biggest issue, and it seems to be working well, for now!< /Text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3lUsooMkdu8WgoFYDx7OaZGg0hpToUBw8jFM9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
As far as U-Haul goes this is one of the better ones. Super clean and tight. Just wish they would relax a little and not make everybody feel suspect. I'm sure they do have a lot of challenges in their business but there was this overall feeling like they were going to ding you for some infraction of the rules. Maybe it gets better if you're a return customer??< /Review>

The customer service at this location is appalling. They shipped my u-box out weeks early and it has been impossible to speak to a manager to get this resolved. Ashley’s attitude in particular is so unbelievably rude I cannot understand how she is employed. All I’ve asked is to get a call back from a manager to resolve the issue and she repeatedly gives me attitude like I’m asking for a new car and then hangs up on me. This type of service has been consistent throughout the whole organization though so I would recommend avoiding using uhaul at all costs.</Text>

My lair, accessed from bottom of the Uhauls bat cave, is around back.

Two dog parks located on the grounds is one of the major reasons I decided on the renovated sunshine Bisquick factories loft spaces.  Plus security is tight and the location is smack dab in between many of my commercial cannabis processing clients.

(WARNING) Property management recently elected to host an array of 5G digital wireless network transmitters, mounted directly in my face, and elsewhere on the top floors perimeter, and since the place has been turned into a literal microwave drumhead.

Since the arrays have been operational I have been experiencing very low energy levels and find myself sleeping 4 or 5 hours more than normal, I never used to take naps but maybe once in a blue moon and last few weeks I have been needing a mid day Afternoon nap almost every day.      So I bought an Ev/RF monitor last week and it has confirmed hazardous levels are present throughout the residential portion of the complex.

I am not the only one who feels the 5G arrays are an issue here and possible public health concern for the community at large.  The interference is being recognized in several ways more than one.

I am going to be bringing forward my concerns with management directly, still want to dig up the white papers on the transmitters to validate what the manufacturers recommendation is for separating the device from occupied residential locations.

Figured i should make a public notice, here on Google,  in advance of any other action , just in case the 5G demigods attempt to retaliate against my person, I intend to be ready for them.<//Review>

I want to make a shout out about Eric at the coliseum location. Eric multi tasks and is a solution oriented guy. He is professional and courteous. He needs a raise. I appreciate his work ethic despite problems that he had to resolve because of other people's inaccuracy. Thank you Eric!<//text>

<time>1565036253813< /time><rating>1< /rating><Review>Manager Marvin "NO" Masangcia should be sent to a customer relations class.  Let this be a lesson to me to post about these experiences as they happen rather than just letting it fly.  1st Experience approx June 1 2019.   I have had the displeasure of dealing with "Mr. No" on two separate occasions.  Once on a one way rental from Las Vegas to Oakland, my reservation included a one month rental unit that was free.  Upon arriving at the facility Marvin told me there were no available units.  Keep in mind this was prearranged online and maybe there was a mistake.  Marvin was sure there were no spaces available and he did not even have to look at his computer.  Again, this was set up in advance for 2 10x10 units.  He also was quick to point out that he was the General Manager and there was no one else that I could speak to.
I stepped outside, called the 800# for Uhaul, after about 30 min and several conversations, I was told that there should be space available as it was arranged prior to leaving Las Vegas.   Great, I stepped back inside, No Marvin?   There was another person who assisted me and found one 10x10 unit available for which I was able to rent.  Marvin was no where to be seen.
2nd Experience today
Rented a 1 way rental from Oakland to Sacramento last Wed-Thursday.  Was offered a 1st month free and using it there at Oakland.    Confirmed this was the case prior to leaving the facility, even offered to remove my things and restart the unit as new.   Was assured there was no problem.   8/5/2019 Uhaul billed my credit card.  I called the facility and was told that the GM said that I was given the wrong information and it was not possible for this to be done.  I asked to speak with the GM and began my second horrible experience with GM Marvin "NO" Masangcia.  NO explained that to  to even add that type of a thing into his computer system because it would cause a "Red Flag".
My opinion is that it is possible, but rather that think about how to make it happen and create a better client experience, and provide the opportunity to have a satisfied customer, NO is the answer and there is NOone else at Uhaul to account for this poor level of service.  Needless to say this will be my last Uhaul experience and will never refer, friends, family or clients to this facility.   I can only hope that not all of the "GM's working for Uhaul, are this rude and unprofessional.

Had originally scheduled to use UHaul on Macarther, but they had a computer malfunction. They directed me to this one at 8000 San Leandro. They had what I needed (a trailer), staff was efficient and pleasant. Store was clean. Guys in the yard were also very helpful and friendly. Great experience.< /Review>

They close the gate 8 minutes earlier than set time, trapping 2 vehicles and 7 people inside of locked building. Safety issues may need to be reviewed. Employee called Juan was helpful in this situation.< /Text>

< review>
They had a flood last thanksgiving and over 30% of my most expensive items in my storage unit were ruined.
The manager David Manges was rude, unapologetic, and sarcastic when I tried to get an assessment of the damages.
*I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!
*And if you do try them, get full coverage insurance!</review>

<rating>1</rating><review>This U-haul location is unprofessional & is ran by amateurs, I've had better experiences at other locations: Ashli Bosley is an African american lady who rented me the U-haul for a same day return. I returned the U-haul the same day I rented it after closing hours, but Ashli called me the next morning saying I didn't return the truck & keys. I told her that I returned the truck the same day, so she put me on hold so that she can double check. She then confirmed that I did return the truck, but I later received a receipt in my email charging me for 2 days of truck usage & insurance. I had to file a claim with U-haul & they told me it will take 3 days for a manager to contact me in regards. Over 3 days went by & still no response from U-haul. I had to file a claim with by bank on the 5th day because U-haul was not trying to give me my money back. My bank had to resolve the issue!.. Thank you Bank Of America, you're the best< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< GmapID>

The service was horrible! We were told we could pick up our ubox before 9am because we have jobs. Arrived at 7:15am, which was confirmed by two different employees. The man at the desk was incredibly rude,telling us we can only get the ubox from 9am to 4pm, which are ridiculous hours if you have a job. I will never come here again!</text>

<Review>last month I came inside to pay for my storage. Ask the lady that took my payment to take the insurance off cause it wasn't needed. she said "ok I have taking off the insurance, so it won't show up on the next bill. Well it did and now I have to wait for a manager to call me to fix the issue. I called the place at 9am it is now 2pm, still no call back and my payment is due today.<//Review>< rate>

-their carts were “displaced” — so you have to carry your stuff or use a dolly all the way to your unit
-staff is completely apathetic: rolled their eyes when we asked where the carts are
-water leaking in building on some units
-rat traps
-very loud alarm going off randomly
-require you to buy a specific padlock (extra charge once you arrive)< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

< review>
I was very disappointed to hear the khutbah/Sermon was only in Arabic as my wife does not speak Arabic. We were visiting SF and this mosque was the closest to the embassy. Although I did hear lots of background voice that later I figured out some one was doing a translation to someone. I guess that's how they do it in this mosque not something I am used too. Plus the location is very very bad mainly surrounded with homeless people and the smell reeks badly. Hope the community there can resolve this issue. Cleanliness in bathroom is only 2 upstairs prayer was a 4 .<//review>

May Allah (swt) guide all of us and reward those who established this masjid with great intentions. It is very sad the recent history of misappropriating funds and lack of ethics at this masjid. My second cousin had her Nikkah here and she experienced what we can only call a straight up shakedown by the Imam for more money before he would release her completed Nikkah form.

This is the House of Allah and God will protect it and God will no doubt send someone to take it over or God will allow it to be shut it down and later insha'Allah re-opened by observant Muslims who will bring ethics, programming, and people back to this masjid.

May Allah (swt) guide and forgive those who have eaten the community funds and acted in a way unbecoming of a community leader. They have consumed fire and a tiny price to exchange for a precious Hereafter.</review>

There are two Jumah Jamaat:
Before DST: 12:45PM and 1:30PM
After DST: 1:45PM and 2:30PM
Prayer starts generally after 15 mins from these times.
Please double check the timings, it may change over time.<//review>

I recently had the opportunity to dine at Tampa Garden Chinese Delight. Parking was a bit tight due to the business surround the restaurant, but there is a lot of street parking after 7pm. If you dare ;)
The location isn't very big, maybe 7 tables inside with no seating outside. Can't eat on a sidewalk!! There are however 2 large round tables that can seat parties of 6 with ease. BUT the table will become crowded if you order too many dishes. (We had maybe 6 different dishes and the table was packed!)
The portions are very generous. The food is flavorful. As a non meat eater, I had no issue finding food to eat here.

At the time I visited, they only accepted cash because their atm / credit card reader wasn't working. Not sure for how long, so bring cash or call to check on their payment options beforehand.<//review>

I love this place.  It's authentic Chinese fare that you can get right here in the Valley instead of flying across the Pacific Ocean!  Yes, the service is slow.  Yes, the decor is no frills.  But all that add to its authenticity.  It's pretty much family operated and they are desperately in need of better help.  But good help are hard to find in the restaurant business.  When you get there, don't worry about seating yourself.  Don't go when you are in a rush.  Just relax and enjoy the anticipation of yummy food that will be coming your way.  Their cares are in the preparation of the food, not pampering you and that suits me just fine.  The proprietor (I assume 'mum' of the family) is always friendly.  Always wants to feed us with her freshly hand made items.  And if she suggest to you to order something, do it.  She knows better than you what is good at her place!  Price is great.  Always order the XLB, the onion (pan) cake if it's not sold out for the day already.  I have not had a dish there that I don't like and I go there for lunch often because it is near work and have tried just about everything on the menu.<//text>

The day I discovered this little treasure was down my street and was so darn AMAZING, my life changed! haha.. seriously though, great great great food, and great service! I love the owner, she is so hardworking and so sweet. They are almost always busy, but my orders have always been done on time (even my really big orders for two families). My favorite must haves: cream cheese wantons and the best beef and broccoli I have ever had!

Don't be fooled by it's location and it's not so appealing look, stop by and give it a try!<//Text>

Had come here from time to time with no quality or service issues. Then it seems like the owner changed or something and quality went downhill. Finally my friend found a giant wad of hair and a bunch of steel wool in his food. Called it quits.</Review>

<review>Delicous chinese food. Typical strip mall eatery decor. The dumplings have hot soup in them; they are great. Best honey walnut shrimp I have had. The fried rice had bright vegetables in it. Never knew fried rice could look anything but brown. Also, the lunch specials are served all day and provides plenty of food for seven bucks. The menu can be overwhelming, and not everything is a home run. The people who run the place try to be nice but sometimes the niceness gets lost in translation.

My girlfriend and I frequent this place often.<//review><gmap_id>0x80c29bbe7fe5107d:0x47385ddc986f9976<//gmap_id></record>

<review>I love love love this place! The service is super friendly (though I've been here so much that might be why.) The food is delicious no matter what I get I never regret it.

The location is a little small, and the food can take a long while since they make it to order. But I really don't care one bit once the food is brought out.

My favorites are:
The juicy xiao long bao
Jalapeño chicken (spicy!)
Egg fried rice

With those ordered I can eat for 4 days.  The minimum credit card order is $20. And their hours are a little strange: 11am-3pm, 5pm-9pm. They are closed on Tuesday.

Totally worth it. I will love this place till my dying day.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<rating>5</rating><text>I'm a dumpling fan. I'm a Taiwanese food fan. I'm a Szechuan food fan. I'm also a Dong Bei (Northeast China) food fan. This place pleases me because it has it all! Whenever craving hits, this is always our go-to spot in the valley.

Soup dumplings AKA XLB (Xiao Long Bao) - 8 pieces. The dumpling skin was perfect and not too chewy like Din Dai Fung. Size was on the normal side but it's OK because the reasonable price makes up for it. Filling was adequate, meaty, juicy, and sweet. (I like it sweet).

Pork and chive dumplings - 10 pieces. The dumpling skin was firm and dense, good texture for the mouth. Size was ginormous. Filling was plump, meaty, and very fulfilling.

Those baskets of joy were there to please! We ordered them to pair with our Beef Lomein entree. The portion was great! I like the generosity. Topped with tons of bean sprouts and beef. I like the wok-char taste to it therefore it's awesome for me. Best of all, no MSG.

The lady is nice and always made me feel like home. This hole-in-the-wall is real and they're on the right track. I'll definitely keep them in mind whenever I need a fix. Well recommended to all ages, race and culture.</text>< Pics>

<review>Do you want dumplings? There are franchise out in glendale.. that say they are good, but they are just too busy and the food is just way too sloppy. The wait lines are long and the taste just is bland. Tampa Garden Chinese Delight is the place to go for dumplings. Most of the Chinese students form CSUN will come here. The majority of patrons are Chinese, Caucasian and Hispanics. Usually on a weekend, tons of chinese people eat here. That should say something if Chinese people eat here. That means this is a legit place to try some dumplings. They have all kinds of dumplings: Chive, Lamb, Pork, etc. It just doesn't get any better. There's only one Tampa Garden Chinese Delight and it's in the heart of northridge. It's opened by a husband and wife and grandma. The grandma takes joy every morning and night making the dumplings. Her workspace is quite adequate and you can see her if she does it. That shows you How fresh these dumplings are. She uses fresh ingredients as well. The husband does the deliveries when needed and the wife does some of the cooking with a bit of help too. Otherwise the husband does the majority of the cooking. Food takes a while to make, since the staff is pretty small, but well worth it. better order some drinks! It's not ur average restaurant will full blown a/c. But hey, if you want superb food, I would do anything for that. Besides the dumpling I love to order the hand made beef noodle soup. A popular noodle soup with brisket which is popular in china. For those who have a hard time waiting, tampa garden chinese delight has a website where you can order online either for pickup.. or when u arrive, the food is ready to serve. I usually do that, to avoid the wait. Luckily this place is the only place that gives a great deal on dumplings and I don't have to drive all the way to alhambra for some dumplings. It also saves me the time to steam and fry them at home. Definitely a must-have to try for dumplings. You should friend me if u want to try these unique places. Hope u enjoyed this review.<//review>< response>

couldn't be more thankful I know this review is a bit late but I still wanted everyone to know that the young lady working the day I got my phone was the biggest help. She was very patient and helpful. The whole store smelled and looked so clean. This is honestly the best location in town<//review>

Always been cool about taking care of any issue that I may have had with either my phone or service. Which hasn't been a problem to begin with. Customer service was also a great experience for me every time I visited.</review>

<username>Edward Clark< /username><Review>My phone got broke last night and I wanted an upgrade badly. I'm glad that I found this store. The rep "Afeef" gave me the best bundle deal with case and glass protector. He even helped me with transferring my contacts.

<text>Very unprofessional staff. Went in about insurance and came out with a brand new phone due to them saying there was nothing they could do and insurance claims can only be done over the phone even though the insurance provider told me to go into the store. The new phone I bought was supposed to come with a separate line for free yada yada only for it to appear on my bill days later and the phone wasn't even on!<//text>< user_name>

Rob was rude on the phone. Not switching from Verizon to metro with his customer service he reminded not to switch they’re a joke and he’s a gold digger.< /review>

< Review>
They always have misleading specials that never apply to this store. Also the female staff have been rude. I just asked about the 7.99 special and the female said “I don’t know” which I responded “ well.. can you ask” and she replied “ check online”. I know for a fact as an employee if you don’t know the answer you search for it. You never say “ I don’t know” specially not “look online”. Lazy ...<//Review>

I would like to congratulate Domino's Pizza of Imperial Beach of being the worst Domino's I have order food from. Out of the last four times we have been there you guys have messed up the order three time. What else is reassure is that the pizza boxes are on the ground where people can walk in a kick dirt and debris on them. The staff overall is not friendly and rude.

The visit today the pizza was ready on time but they forgot the rest of the order and had to sit for 30 plus minutes for them to mess up the order further.

Papa John up the road is the opposite and the Domino's in Coronado is great.< /Text>

After experiencing terrible customer service due to misleading promotions at this location a few months ago I stopped patronizing this establishment. But after receiving a 50% off offer I downloaded the app and decided to give them one more try since my daughter was coming down to watch the game with me. I placed the order online but when I arrived and attempted to alert them via the app I repeatedly received an error. I attempted to go inside to let them know that I was here but understandably the door was locked. I tapped on the glass in an attempt to get someones attention. A young lady inside looked at me but made no attempt to acknowledge my presence. After tapping on the glass 3 or 4 times another customer arrived and the employee that ignored me brought her order out. I attempted to ask for my order but she again ignored me and went back inside. After calling the store she came out again and berated me for tapping on the glass. I told her that I simply wanted my pizza and that the app didn't work when I attempted to check in. She pointed to a sheet of paper taped to the glass (among many other items attached to the glass) and told me that I should read the instructions. I told her that if she required me to read the notices on the glass then she could have pointed to the correct one from inside. She was rude, discourteous and condescending. I told her to cancel the order and to refund my card. After arriving at home I read the sign which states that one customer at a time is allowed in the store. This contradicts her information. I won't go back.</Text>

Great service, fast and friendly. This guy made me a special pizza that wasn't even on the menu, best I've had. No name tags, but heard someone call him Donovan. Has a nice little eat in area and a monitor that tells you the status of your pizza.<//review>

<Review>Worst experience for the first time from this location.  First I couldn’t check in from the app but what was important was both my pizza’s are dry barely any sauce and barely had cheese either I had to add cheese to one of them and put it back in the oven that’s how bad it lacked cheese.  Then when the girl brought it out she forgot the ranch which is not a big deal but instead of going inside to get the ranch someone was there dropping something off to her so she goes inside and comes back out with her keys and went to her car instead of getting my ranch.  Then went back inside to get my ranch to bring out to me.  Not even a hey do you mind if I get that first or how about hmmm I don’t Know  bring my ranch out at the same time as she grabbed her keys.</Review>< Resp>

<Resp>None</Resp><Review>Ordered online and went to pick up our order. We were there early and once we were told online that our order was completed we went to the door. We were met by an employee and he checked on our order. He came back about 3 minutes later and told us he was sorry but the order was not completed but it would be done in 5 minutes. I completely understood due to the current situation.15 more minutes went bye and finally a different employee came out and asked for names. I explained to him that we have been waiting for more than 20 minutes. He did not care. He continued to get other peoples orders processed before ours. After 25 minutes we finally received our pizzas, again I completely understand the current situation but there is no excuse for being rude to your customers.<//Review>< gmap_id>

really bad costumer service by phone. The girl from the phone was really rude!! Yeah like I get it you have work to do but just chill and try to give your costumers good service and try to help them nicely. But this girl was just RUDE! I put a star because I had to choose something in order to make a rate but honestly its a -1! I have a lot of years ordering from that dominos and to be honest this time was the last. Horrible costumer service.<//text>

Every single time I order from this store, which sadly is quite often, I select contactless delivery , tip the driver ahead of time generously and yet every single time the driver pounds on my door until I answer it and take my food. They say they can’t see its contactless , what is the point of this service if it’s defective 100% of the time?< /Review>

<Review>ordered my pizzas for delivery and the time was 30mins for delivery. Didn’t get my pizzas for over and hour and it was cold. When I called to let them know. I was told I would get a refund within a couple of days. I called back after a week and was told to call corporate. After several attempts I finally got a response. I was told it’s privately owned and that I had to contact them. Called and talked to a so called manger and 2 months later still no refund. terrible customer service.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>2</Rating><review>Ordered 2 medium pizzas and cinnamon twists.

The hand tossed pepperoni pizza was good, could have had a bit more sauce and cheese closer to the edges though.

The chicken pan pizza was not cooked all the way, it did not have toppings all the way to the edges as advertised, not all slices even had chicken.

The delivery person forgot the 2nd pizza and had to go back for it.

The cinnamon twists were good!!

This may be why I have not ordered from this location in many years.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

It’s a corporate thing. I guess.  Dominoes will short the sauce unless u ask for extra, the sauce is the flavor, u don’t short on that!  U can get mediocre pizza all over the place, I call dominoes for taste.  Haha, never again.  Keep the corporate belt tight!< /review>

Next time we'll buy a frozen pizza. The pizza that was delivered was soggy, the dough was almost wet inside the outter edge, hardly any sauce on it. By th ed time it got to me, it was warm - not hot. Taste was bland. Ease of order and fast delivery were the only pluses.<//Review>

<Review>Delivery driver was late by about 10 min. Jose was still polite and I’m sure he just wanted to end his night since I was probably the last order of the night but he could have been ontime...night have been the cooks fault?

Pizza completed cooking and quality check at 5:42pm but wasn't delivered until 6:10pm, it was 6:02 before it even left the store, that's an unusually long time. Consequently the pizza was only lukewarm by the time we received it. Also I paid for double cheese and there is no way it had double cheese, it barely had any cheese at all. My wife likes to have dominos pizza once a week, usually on Saturday evening, but if it was up to me I would be buying my pizza elsewhere. There are times when their pizza is pretty good, but unfortunately their quality control is very inconsistent.<//text>

We get pizza from here about 2 times a month.  It is always delicious, especially the handmade pan pizzas.  The staff is very friendly and I honestly look forward to picking up my pizza from here!  Never once had a problem.  Try ordering online - they have more coupons available.<//review>

<Text>Awesomer, cheaper and faster. Their $5.99 deal blows EVERYONE out of the water. The competitors keep sending us emails talking about "we miss you, come back, here's a coupon." Even with that coupon, it's STILL cheaper to get it from Domino's. One dollar more than Little Ceasar's and better tasting. Even their wings are bigger and juicier. Pizza Hut always sends freaking dry pigeon wings. As long as they have this deal, they have us as a frequent customer.<//Text>< UserId.>

Two days ago I had placed an order for a medium pizza and hot wings. Both of my items came late, they were both cold, and the ranch for my wings were both open with no ranch in them. I called them and told them what had happened and they had told me they were going to give me storevcredit which was $17. So when I tried to redeem my store credit the manager was the one who attended me and said that there was no such thing. But the manager that had given me the store credit was him. So there for why will you lie to YOUR customers saying that you will give store credit when in the end you won't.< /Review>

Food...good...service on the phone...NOT GOOD. Online progress showed pizza delivered before it was, so I called, and could not get anyone to answer...called again, and the rep could not understand why I was calling just because the site told me it was already delivered...? Teach your monkeys not to update progress ahead of time...real time is the reason, right? Thou shalt not respect idiots before me...

In general the food is pretty good. Delivery can be slow when they overschedule the delivery drivers.

<text>Note to every one that orders online for this store the store manager will cancel your order even if you have email confirmation if it is over $40 and you don't answer your phone and the number they call u from dose not say dominos oh and he will not leave a message saying what he is doing then when you go to the store he says it's because he gets a lot of prank orders that he has to pay for out of his bonus no apologies and he can't honor the online price so you have to reorder online for him to make it</text>< Pics>

Delivery is excellent, the quality of the food is excellent and the "real time" tracking is excellent. I never knew Domino's was the "go-to" late night pizza choice -)<//review>

I was told 15 minutes and I actually give them 20 minutes and when I got there it was not ready. I was ok with that so I just paid and I sit down and waited. After another 20 minutes I got up and I ask and the pizza was just sitting in the shell and they never even bother to let me know it was ready. Will never go back, workers don't care.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Worst visit to dominoes in a long time. Ignored by employees walking by while waiting at the counter. So I ordered on the app. Pizza came out super fast. But had to wait 20 minutes after it came out in order to get noticed again at the counter and to pay for my food. Got home opened up on of the pizzas to find one with out sauce! What happened dominoes? I went back, the cranky manager was very unpleasant but still decided to make us another, but told the cook to put aloooooot of sauce. So thanks</review><time>1366675822087</time><pics>None< /pics><Rating>3< /Rating><Gmap_id>0x80d94c6b634e5659:0x2e6d068e6bf15448</Gmap_id><UserId.>101829191589498060895< /UserId.><Name>T Block< /Name><response>None< /response></record>

I live in the state of Arizona my son is in California with it being his birthday I wanted to order Pizza for everyone in his dorm room so I look up the number I called them the first lady I talked to wound up hanging up on me while I was looking for a coupon code because she didn't know where her coupon codes were so I call back this gentleman has an attitude the entire time then when you call the store the automated system offers you a two liter of soda with your choice of either 2 lava cakes or one of the breads that they have or you can choose Cinna Stix for 5.99 I tell them I want that with Cinna Stix he then proceeded to argue with me that that is not what the recording says that it is only good with the lava cakes we don't like chocolate as weird as it is I know okay so after he's yelled at me that I'm incorrect on the coupon I told him fine don't use a coupon I'll pay the full $6.99 to order the cinnasticks and as soon as I told him I needed to give him the phone number so that somebody can meet him for delivery he then said wait are you paying cash or card I told him my card of course because I'm not at the school in California he then tells me oh we can't deliver because you need to sign the receipt absolutely ridiculous their customer service would be better handled by 2 year old I told him that's ridiculous just forget it I will call Pizza Hut I got 3 extra pizzas from Pizza Hut and it still cost me $15 less then what dominos was going to charge me</Text>

<Review>I've been going here my entire adult life, between 3-20 times a year. The atmosphere is very casual and family friendly. The prices and service have always made it feel great to leave a good tip. Even when we haven't come in for a long time, retiring, we are treated like family. Please support them in these trying times!<//Review>< Pictures>

<Name>Ryan Miller< /Name><Text>We have been coming here for years. The owner is super friendly always comes to hang out n chat and gives us his special home made hot sauces. Proceed with caution if you try one they are hot! Good food for the price. One of the few places around here you can get away with a 10$ meal</Text>< response>

All-you-can-eat! Hard to beat right?

While the assembly line might lack in overall freshness - it makes up for it with options.

Also, the dinner deal makes this my favorite Mongolian BBQ spot in all of Thousand Oaks.

Great service, and usually some sports on TV if you’re having lunch.

Lots of food for a fair price - and the owner has no problem setting you up with a take-home plate.<//review>

<Review>Best noodles you’ll have!!  You can build your bowl with whatever you want, as large at you want. (You have to be good as adding the noodles at the end to make it bigger). The service is amazing, because the owner is one of the greatest guys!  (For me, it’s more worth it to come for lunch because it’s less expensive than all you can eat dinner, and you can get a to go box). Not to mention the whisking and taste is nothing short of phenomenal!  Truly one of Thousand Oaks wonders!< /Review><GmapID>0x80e825232540bce7:0x1071678fd4a74bd0</GmapID><response>None<//response>< user>

<Review>Good food, lunch is ~$10 as much as you can fit into a bowl (just make sure you compress the items as much as possible). Dinner is ~14, but it's all you can eat. Allow yourself for plenty of time and bring an appetite.< /Review>< userid>

This Mongolian BBQ has been around since the 70s. I used to own the camera shop that was next door to the restaurant. Would go in there at least two or three times a week for lunch or dinner. I love the food though I do wish the selection of vegetables was more. We moved our location of the camera shop and Mongolian BBQ eventually expanded out knock down the wall and double their size. Whenever we go to Thousand Oaks we eat there. Still love the food</review>

We have gone to this restaurant for a long time.  Sometimes it gets a little messy, but if you like Mongolian BBQ this place is good.  The manager is a hard worker and really wants to please the custom.<//text>

So glad that we have a Mongolian BBQ in T.O. It is delicious and a fun way to cook food. They have added a few items lately to throw on the grill, but there is always room to add more. It's all you can eat, but I usually don't finish my 2nd dish!</Text>

<review>Really great family place if you're looking for a place that is casual and homey with good quality food and great service without needing the expensive fancy decor. Staff is extra friendly and attentive and was so impressed at how kind and equally attentive they were to kids eating there. Lot of healthy and delicious flavorful options to pick and choose for all tastes so appeals to all. Brought a large group in and it was perfect as everyone made their own dish to order so appealed to everyone.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<review>I have been coming to this Mongolian BBQ since the mid 1980's, when it was Lusty's Mongolian BBQ, and I was still in high school. The restaurant is much bigger now (they expanded into the space next door), and the food is just as wonderful as it always has been. They have a great selection of items to fill your bowl with, and each entree includes their wonderful soup, potstickers and flat bread. When I'm in Thousand Oaks, I always try to stop by. The staff is always friendly and the food fabulous. What more could you want?< /review><user_id>102246791629412008901< /user_id><Date>1528587139450</Date></record>

Decent food and small parking lot make this an average spot. They have a good lunch special - make sure you load up on smaller pieces of meat, otherwise you will get less food.

One thing is true: I have never left here still hungry!</Review>

<text>I went to see Dr. Z because I wanted to find a cosmetic dentist who could do a beautiful and painless job of reconstructing my teeth with implants and completely natural looking fake teeth. I am a big wimp and run for my life from anything painful. If teeth need to be pulled they better plan on knocking me unconscious. This place does that.

I was very impressed with Dr Z because he was the only dentist I have ever seen that gave me a REALISTIC opinion  of what was really going on with my gums & jaw heath. He didn't paint the pretty picture I wanted to hear but he did tell me what most dentists are too afraid to say--that my entire mouth was full of decay from years of smoking & neglect. My once flawless smile was in serious trouble--my teeth were falling out and the ones I still had in the front all had to go. This guy gave me a step by step plan toward my final goal that made sense to me. Nobody else I had seen for this was even close to his honesty about my situation.
I chose Dr Z out of all the dentists I have seen because getting full implants is no small decision and I believe he is the best guy for my complicated situation.<//text></record>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Text>Dr Z is a typical middle eastern snake oil salesman out to bill you for work that you actually never needed. We all should try to act opposite of any stereotypes we may potentially represent but unfortunately this guy further cements the used car salesman from Kabul persona. I didn't give a one star because his office is very clean and ripe for a swindling environment. Avoid!</Text>< Gmap_id>

The atmosphere was pleasant the doctor was great the staff was well informed .Overall, t was a great experience. Unfortunately my severe work needed is costly and must be paid prior. It saddens me that nothing will probably be completed in my case.<//Review>

<Review>Dr Z and his office staff are amazing! Just by luck I found them after seeing a advertisement about a Dental Grant, I need so much work done and didn’t have the money. I took the chance because I’m always in pain and I’m very afraid of dentists and I loved the way they treated me just during my consult.
Dr Z and his office is amazing .
Dr Z office did a thorough eval / X-rays, explained everything in detail and gave me a Grant to help with the expenses. I had a lot of work done yesterday and the shots were literally painless, Dr Z was so kind during the entire procedure. I can’t say enough. Thank you Dr Z</Review>< pics>

<Review>Although expensive, the staff was amazing and very friendly as well as detailed in explaining the process and financial aspect of treatment.  They took it slow with me and explained its a journey and I truly appreciate their understanding of my anxiety regarding visiting the dentist.  I had a bad experience with my last dentist in the Navy so it was great how friendly and comforting they were in working with me.   My Xray tech was so friendly and sweet she had me at ease soon after sitting down.  Dr Z was friendly and straight to the point which I appreciate!  Thank you Dr Z and staff for making it a great consultation!  I appreciate you and see you again soon!</Review>< rating>

Please be careful of very high pricing for the service you may receive. The office manager who is in charge of billing will rip you off. I ordered a night guard but an hour after called and canceled as I found out I can’t even use them due to gagging(referring to the old one I had which never used) and most importantly they had charged me more than double and only for the top one and not even both upper and lower. Although the night guard was supposed to be ready in one week but after my phone call for cancelling they expedited the order and they had made it ready the day after when I went back to get my $750 that I had paid cash.  Instead of helping a patient who desperately called right away and requested to cancel the order while I was one of the last patients that night, they went ahead and processed the order for quick pick up!! Are you kidding me?? Your lab picked it up right that night and worked on it after hours to make it ready for a client who has called to cancel?! I never picked up the night guard and they kept my money. I guess it was too painful to return my cash even if I had asked them to cancel right away!</Text>

Everyone in that office was extremely nice and knowledgeable. Dr. Z was no exception. He wasted ni time in evaluating my teeth and once approved by me he went to work, came up with a game plan and put it all into action.
I would recommend Dr. Z and his staff highly!< /review>

Went into the office very nervous about the dental work that needed to be done. They had amazing customer service. Dr. Z was very thorough in what I needed to do get done and what could also be done that is not urgent. The procedure went extremely well, and I definitely no longer have that nervousness about going back!<//review>

<Review>A complete disappointment!
scheduled a cleaning, only to arrive and find out they’re only doing xrays and consultation, even though i provided a copy of my recent xrays and specifically asked that my cleaning be done on that day.
accepted the xrays but held off on the cleaning because they wanted to charge more (“you require a special type of cleaning which your insurance will not cover 100%...”) and now they want $35 to send me jpg copies of xrays via email!!

such BS!!!!

i’ll be taking my treatment and business elsewhere!<//Review>< Resp>

Had a great experience at this office, the staff was very friendly as well as they got me in real quick which was nice. Also, you could tell Dr. Z knows what he is doing, he really helped me understand the issues that I had with my oral health and as well as I feel that I left more knowledgeable with how to take better care of my teeth.

Hello, I’ve been going to this dentist for about a year, and was there last week after the Covid reopening, I’m very pleased to see the precautions that are in place to keep the patients and the staff safe, the staff are friendly and knowledgeable, I was in and out quick, and Dr. Z was able to take care of all my issues that day which included getting fitted for a crown, Dr. Z is very experienced and professional and explains my options in a way that’s easy to understand.</Review>

<Review>1) I have always been afraid of the dentist. I don’t like vocalizing it because, well, I’m an adult. But I have to say the whole staff at DENT-ALL By Dr. Z put you at ease. Before my cleaning, I was given a warm aromatherapy wrap to place on my neck, as well as a drop of lavender essential oil on my hands to relax me. This is just their regular practice; I didn’t say I was afraid, and no procedures began for them to notice me getting tense.
2) As far as the cleaning, it was the best cleaning I’ve ever gotten. I’m used to feeling rough ridges after a cleaning and wishing I caved to purchase the deep cleaning with my old dentist. Dr. Z and his team made sure my teeth were beautiful after the standard cleaning :)
3) Finally, I purchased Invisalign through DENT-ALL By Dr. Z a few weeks before quarantine began. I let them know that I really wanted my teeth straightened and was tired with being disappointed with bad customer service with knock off companies (Do NOT go with Candid unless you want your file to go missing twice after paying $1800 up front and waiting 5 months for aligners that never show up!). Anyways, after we shared a few laughs, they reassured me that DENT-ALL By Dr. Z make their patients a priority and are always reachable. Even though their office was closed for 3months due to quarantine, I never felt neglected. Their considerate team reached out to me to schedule my next appointment, and even called me day of (once reopened) to reassure they were open and ready for me. Side note: they are VERY CLEAN and practice excellent preventative measures. My Invisalign appointment was a breeze, by the way. I even got a ribs recipe out of it! Is it weird that I don’t mind going to the dentist now?

The team at DENT-ALL By Dr. Z is thorough, attentive, and overall amazing! Thank you guys so much!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80dce7fe484f917b:0x941d9f73494d8772</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>It costs $25 to get your X-rays. First you pay your insurance to cover your xrays, then you gotta pay the office to get your xrays, so you're paying twice for the same thing.  This is the only office I've encountered that charges you for something that insurance is already paying for.

After my consultation, I was told I'd have to pay around $3500 to get everything I need done, that is after insurance covers $1500, for a total bill ~$5000

I went to another dentist and my out of pocket is now $450.

The office is nice, the staff is friendly, the prices are ridiculous (but that's fine if you want to pay it).  The x-ray thing is why they get 1 star. I'm not paying 2x for this.  My insurance already covers it, and I pay for my insurance, I'm not paying the office too.<//review>< pictures>

They got me in quick which was fine but yet used all my x-rays when they should of only taken 1 or 2 and then tried to charge $800 for something that would of cost less than $100. So if like to just give away money then this is the perfect place to go</review>

Great doctor and staff. I had the in office 30 min laser whitening done and I am incredibly happy about it! Beautiful office and caring doctor. He even checked one of my teeth I had a concern about and told me his opinion about it and what I should do to take better care of it. Even though I was just there for a whitening and not an exam, that speaks volumes in my book. I am going to become their patient as well. By the way office is modern and super clean with high tech gadgets.<//text>

I feel like the focus was more on making money than actually fixing or in this case cleaning my teeth... I feel like the way my teeth were being clean was very vicious and was done too quick...< /review>

2 years ago I heard a commercial from Dr z. He charged me 9000 dollars for 8 crowns. I was not happy with the service and I lost a tooth because of a mistake he made. So an implant became necessary for that tooth.. The other 7 are also not good and I m not satisfied with them.
He referred me out to do the implant. I have spent 2000 dollars on that implant but the implant is not done yet because he has not put the crown he had promised. He stopped responding to me and kept cancelling my appointments.
I have suffered for one year and he is not responsive.
I m very upset. I emailed and got no response. Others doctors who I saw after him all said his work was not good and there are problems with crowns he put for me.</text>

<Text>Took awhile to go back appointment at 11 started x-rays at 1130. Dr was pleasant and seemed honest. My only issue was with the money part. I was very confused about what they were trying to charge me for. I asked for a break down and print out but was told that she couldn't. I just felt like she was making up numbers while she talked and she wouldn't look me in the eye so made me feel like she was being very dishonest.</Text>< Resp>

<Text>These dental office ripped me off.  They told me that Denti-cal will never cover the procedures they want me to get done.  They did some deep cleaning and got me in debt that cost me more than $2000 no interest of course.  The amenities they have you’re paying for it.  On top of that they charged me $270 for my son’s root canal that is covered by Denti cal just because we have another dental coverage that’s a PPO.  I will never come to this place ever again.  The 4.5 rating they have is bogus.< /Text>< pictures>

I wanted my front teeth to move backwards,that was the only reason I wanted to see the dentist. I went to see this doctor because it was near to my place. They took a look at my teeth and asked me to do the Invisalign. I ended up paying ‘6,200’ dollars for Invisalign and treatment was just for 6 months. After completion of using Invisalign, doctor told me that my front teeth will not move backwards and it will never move even in future. He mentioned that he needs to cut my teeth for my front teeth to move backwards. I don’t know why I was asked to go with Invisalign when he was sure that my front teeth will not move backwards. I just wasted 6,200 dollars. That was my 8 months savings.< /review>

I usually visit this center during my lunch hour and noticed that their new office just opened. Made an appointment and met with the doctor. An amazing office, everyone is so professional and caring and they greet you very kindly and they are sincere. I am very happy with this office and intent to refer all my family and coworkers to experience their truly unique dental spa atmosphere. Thank you for taking such good care of me.....<//Text>

<Text>Always very apprehensive of the dentist till last month when I visited this place. Very modern and clean. Everyone there was very professional. I had made an appointment after work and due to unexpected traffic because of construction arrived late to my visit. Knowing I would already be nervous, they took their time and made sure I was comfortable and made my overall experience a very pleasant one.
Thank you Dr. Z for making sure I was not rushed thru and taking good care of my teeth. This was by far my most pleasant experience at the dentist. I plan to be a regular here! Well every 6 months for my cleanings that is .<//Text><gmap_id>0x80dce7fe484f917b:0x941d9f73494d8772< /gmap_id><response>None</response></record>

One of the most beautiful places I have hiked. The astonishing view of the lakes and mountains make it seem like you are dreaming. It's not a busy trail but the parking lot at the base lake does get crowded very early so plan ahead and get there early.</Review>

Great hike. My wife and I with two kids under five did this hike 45 years ago. I am 75 years old now and was curious to see how much change has taken place. Wow, the lower lake does not exist and the second lake is no more than a small pond. I may be wrong but I think the second lake is Green Lake.</Text>

Great hikes. Bishop pass/long lake hike is much easier than the treasure lakes hike which shares the same trailhead and splits off about half a mile in. It’s an additional 2.2 miles to treasure lakes (1st lake) on a harder to follow and steep trail. Again, long lake to the left is much easier.</Review>

<text>The lake is still frozen in the middle of April, 90% of the trail covered with the snow. Last 1 mile of the road is “Closed”, but you still can use it. Stunning views and very nice place for camping, hiking and enjoing the nature😍🏔</text><Rate>5</Rate>< gmapID>

Very scenic with tall snow ladden mountains visible feom the trail head itself. South lake is also right there. It is at quite an elevation and hence can be cold (35F) in the morning with strong winds (June 18, 2018)<//Text>

Just wanted to give a big shout out to Sean for his outstanding customer service this morning.  I haven't had customer service like that in years.  I'm just starting out with some crafting projects that will need a respirator and mask (1 of each!) and he went above and beyond in reaching out to the manufacturer with my questions and promptly called me back within an hour with all questions answered.  I realize he probably deals in much higher volumes than the lil' ole' lady from FL and her crafting project.  He was simply amazing and deserves the recognition.  Thank you Sean!!!  And thank you envirosafety! ;)< /text>

The product itself was good. I ordered a hazmat suit from them for a film production, looks great, probably also works great. My biggest issue and the reason why I'm giving them 1 star is that literally since I bought it, they keep calling me. For a year and a half I'll wake up to voicemails and missed calls from Enviro Safety asking to call them back  I told them to stop and they did for a while but I have received literally 3 calls from them just this morning. It's ridiculous and I recommend that everyone stay away from them as long they continue to pester customers like this.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>It's not often that I talk to a guy (Ryan Tucker @enviroSafety) who tells me straight out what I need *and* what I don't need to by -even though it might mean more sales.

Thanks Ryan; it's very nice to know ethics is still in vogue w/ you and your company. I'll certainly return -again and again.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Wanted to share my experience. I am a Service Director at an Audi Dealership in Maryland. With Audi's new electric products this company is one of two vendors for PPE for those certified tech's. I was able to get one of my techs in a class last min and needed the PPE to complete the training. It left me with a week to order and get the PPE. I ordered online and was worried about a warning that popped up when I ordered. I called the office and they said someone would call me back who could answer the question. Again I was worried, think everyone has been promised a call before.... Mr. Austin Maly called me back within the hour on a Friday evening. Very nice/polite and professional. He told me his vender had been delayed on a shipment and he would keep an eye out for me. He fielded many calls from me and gave me up to date information. Promised to move the shipping from standard to next day or two day air depending on when they could get it out. He also got a Mr. Gustavo Martinez involved and he was also extremely helpful. I can't say enough about both of these gentleman. The shipment came in on Thursday and my tech is now able to attend the training!. Absolutely the best customer service I have gotten in a very long time. Being in the Auto industry that is weighted very hard on customer service. I know how difficult it is to provide top notch customer service. Enviro Safety Products should be extremely grateful to have employees that exceed expectations. Thank you. You make the company better everyday at every touchpoint.<//review>

Don't do business with them. BTW, why they have a 4.7 star review if you click from their web?? Liars!

Update, just saw the owner responded 30 minutes ago. I have contacted them already. They promise a week at most for the refund. I didn't get the refund after 12 days. Why should I contact them again? Totally a waste of my time. I don't deal with them if they don't keep their promise. And they had my money for 1 month and doing nothing.

I have placed an order on Jan 25th. I was charged almost next day. However, my order was "in route" for three weeks. I don't want to wait. I sent an email to them to cancel this order. They replied that the order would be canceled and I will be refunded in a week. Don't trust them, it has been 12 days, I still don't see the refund. I sent an email again to inquiry this, no reply. I will dispute my credit card tomorrow.< /review><user>115359032737974295790< /user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I purchased 6 boxes of masks 6 days ago (Jan 24, 2020). Today Jan 31, 2020 no update status email or nothing. All silence and they dare to charge me 24 dollars for shipping.  I understand the mask supply and demand situation but another company that I ordered over 800 masks from has already shipped me the ordered masks including the same kind of masks that I ordered from Enviro Safety.  Next week I definitely will contact my credit card company and dispute the 208 dollars in this Enviro Safety order.  They cannot cheat my money easily.  I swear I won't buy from Enviro Safety any more.</Text>< rate>

<Text>I purchased 2 boxes of masks 5 days ago (Jan 25,2020). Today Jan 30,2020 no update status email or nothing. Online says order is processed but does not say shipped. I ordered eye googles from another company and had them in 2 days.  I feel like if they were out of stock the product should have said so but it did not.  I'll wait a little longer then I will take it up with my bank on getting a refund. I don't want to wait till its a dire need to have the mask when I possibly could have shopped else where for said items. Update they refunded me the money and apologized for not having stock for every where in the world was demanding these items. I would try them again in the future should a need warrant it. :)</Text><GmapID>0x809527a5f09bfc95:0x5a57fafbd7368c0</GmapID></record>

I ordered some masks on Jan 23.  At the time of purchase the web pages showed items in stock and would ship quickly or something like that.  Next day I sent an inquiry and they told me items on back order for several weeks.  I asked them why the web pages showed in stock and they didn't respond to that question.  They told me i could cancel; so I did on the morning of Jan 28 via email.  No responses the next few days.  I called early Feb waited 30 minutes and spoke with a customer service rep to cancel order for refund.  It has been a week and still NOTHING.  I never had this kind of terrible experience and probably will take legal action against this company.  They don't communicate nothing on the cancellation or refund.  No responses at all.

I purchased for 300 of 3M mask on Jan 25, I saw they are still be in stock on that time. I have paid more $300 for fastest delivery on 1 order, but I didn’t get anything until now. No answer calling, no response email, impossible cancel order, still be charged. This is a damn scam company. Such a shame for 3M company with a dealer like this!</Review>

Stop responding to negative feedback and start responding to emails you post your email address every where But you don’t respond to actual emails;

< review>
Needed items (3M helmet assemblies) for work ASAP so I paid $270 overnight shipping. 2 days later, checked on the status of the order to see "Routed". Called and the Customer Service rep looked it up and said the expected ship date is 4/15. She said "not sure if these are a custom made item or backordered or what..."; this is noteworthy since I just skimmed another review that received similar reports. I asked if anyone was planning to call me to notify me and she looked it up and said "it looks like it wasn't flagged." Pretty unacceptable. To top it off, the $2500 cost on my credit card is going to take 72 business hours to clear, so I'll be lucky If I'm able to put another order through somewhere else.</review>

DO NOT use this company if you are PURCHASING any products OUTSIDE the USA... lots of hidden fee. Need to use a money order to process the order plus you will be paying additional duties once the product arrives.

<review>I had a lot of work to do in a noisy environment and ordered some hearing protection.  3 weeks later I'm still waiting....

I've had the following issues with Enviro Safety:

1) The website does not provide any way to track an order unless you sign up.  (And if you sign up after you place an order, than that order isn't listed as "yours" so you can't track it.)

2) The website does not provide contact or operating hours.

3) My item should have been shipped, yet they have not bothered to send me an update with the tracking number.

4) Their website would not allow me to use my normal email.  (I use an email with a newer domain.  That their website rejects such domain names means it's 8-10 years out of date on that function.)  I had to use an email I rarely check.  (Oddly enough, just a few weeks after giving them that email, which has been "dead" for a few years, I started getting spam on that email address and blackmail emails asking for money in Bitcoin.)

5) I've been given several different stories on why my item has been delayed.  First it was because 3M made that item up custom, each time one was ordered.  (Something about different options and so on.)  Later they said it was backordered.  Now, it's before their closing time (and before 5:00 PM in their timezone) and, after repeated attempts, I can't reach them on the phone.

6) I have just received an email from UPS.  (NOT Enviro Safety.)  I'm having a package shipped to me via UPS SurePost and will be here in 7 days.  This is when I paid for USPS Priority 2nd Day.

It's really hard to get a clear answer about what's going on.  If I had understood that it was just a simple backorder, I'd have cancelled or not ordered from them.  While they would not have had my order that time, they'd have a chance at me buying from them in the future.

I ordered from them and placed trust in them and they actively earned distrust.  I have yet to see signs of competence.</review>< Resp>

Even in challenging times for travel, this gem still keeps its rock n roll vibe but is super clean and attentive. The restaurant is outside and open, the rooms are pristine, even minibar and remotes are sanitized and wrapped. Plus, most comfortable bed ever. Can’t wait to come back.< /Text>

The setting of this hotel is beautiful! It's so lush and green, that you don't even feel like you are in the city. It has a quiet and peaceful atmosphere. The restaurant, Cavatina, is delicious and has wonderful outdoor seating next to running water and tons of greenery! The pool is refreshing!<//review>

<UserId.>None< /UserId.><text>Never again. I travel 75% of the year. My first impression was underwhelming but hopeful. DO NOT stay in the main lodge. The hallways are DARK, and the smell is reminiscent of a sewer! I am NOT exaggerating. We immediately requested an upgrade and as a VIP Gold member we are offered an upgrade if available. While a Villa was available they refused to offer it UNLESS we paid an extra $120, over the approximately $500 paid. Additionally, plan to pay a resort fee and parking that will run you about $100 total. The Villas are much nicer but are in SERIOUS need of a remodel and updating. I could go on and on and on but you get the drift. GO SOMEPLACE ELSE!!!!!!<//text><Rate>None< /Rate><pics>None</pics><Time>1605484800000< /Time>< Response>

A jewel in the hills of Hollywood.
There are some hotels that feel alive and tell a story to the guest lucky enough to stay; This is one of those hotels. A journey back into a time when things were fun, a feeling of moving forward and immediately present is displayed upon entering this sleek unpretentious hidden hotel. The professional staff from valet, doorman, reception and housekeeping that always greet you w/a sincere smile - never saccharine.  It's an older hotel that has kept itself clean and polished over the years and has updated itself appropriately, and tastefully. The lush gardens are beautiful and beckon you to stroll before or after a lovely dinner at Cavatina. A wondefully romantic restaurant w/a well thought out wine list.
The cuisine prepared by Luis Morales is fresh, bright and bursting w/subtle nuances and the staff in the restaurant are more than accommodating. There is a levity that is pervasive on the grounds w/an abundance of rock and roll photography and paraphernalia.  This hotel might be in the heart of Hollywood but feels like an oasis w/twinkling fairy lights and a calm hush over a private retreat. The two pools are clean, cool and deep....I'm six foot two inches and despise these kiddie pools so many hotels favor presently. The large absorbent towels provided at poolside is a major plus and a detail often overlooked by many. The limited poolside menu  had options for all types of appetites. My family and I look forward to our return soon. Thank you to the entire staff at the Sunset Marquis, sorry this review is 6 months old but the heartfelt feelings are still on point. A special thanks to Yoman for providing such wonderful hospitality.< /review>

We only stay at the Marquis when we are in LA. Its location just off Sunset in West Hollywood which is perfect for us. Their onsite restaurant is awesome and we love their staff, especially Logan the bellman who is an amazing artist and has worked there for 25+ years. It is such a cute garden sanctuary in the middle of the hustle. Feels like our LA home.< /Text>

The best kept secret for a weekend stay, restaurant, outside cocktail bar, world-renowned Bar 1200, spa.......  The Sunset Marquis has a history that you can be a part of. The Cavatina Restaurant serves fantastic food. Don't be surprised if you run into Hollywood elite and music icons. I won't mention those we ran into here to protect their privacy, which is why they choose to stay at the Sunset Marquis.  Want to impress your significant other? Stay in a villa and experience not only all that I have mentioned, but also the beautifully landscaped grounds. You want high class and privacy at the same time? This is the place!</Text>

We got upgraded to a suite and super happy with it! Very convenient for West Hollywood. If your lgbt then this place is walking distance from all the night life you can imagine. There is also convenient shopping areas near by. Would stay here again. It was so comfortable.<//Review>

What a charming amazing hotel. Full of history and culture.  My favorite nights here are on Tuesday nights when the bars packed with amazing patrons.  There's the piano and live singing.  It's truly an amazing experience.

Highly recommend the Villa suites.</Review>

This hotel is perfection. Our villa, which was large, beautiful and and comfortable, felt private But everything we needed was a quick walk through gorgeous foliage. The service is top notch without feeling overly formal, the food is great and room service is always available. I travel all over the world and I think this is my favorite hotel right now.</Text>

Upon arrival, a valet greeted us warmly. Desk staff were awesome, and they had gift bags waiting for our children in the room. The grounds and hotel are amazing. Concierge was very helpful and the onsite restaurant was good, with good food and service. They will even give you free fish food to feed the koi fish. Only negative thing I can possibly say is that the hotel is somewhat segregated, with areas (and a separate pool) for "VIPs". While they do make you feel like a VIP, it kind of bothered me. Though you can walk right up to the second VIP pool without anyone stopping you.< /review>

<Text>I only used the spa and poolside service here. I wasn't a hotel guest. But I wouldn't have said it is a "luxiry" property as advertised. Service was pretty bad (I had to follow up for a menu by the pool several tomes and wait even longer). Spa prices were extortionate for the service I got. (Prenatal massage with no pregnancy pillow so I had to lie awkwardly on my side).

The hotel grounds are OK, but a bit worn out and tired looking.

They've got a few things to work on.< /Text>< pics>

Beautiful hotel with an artistic atmosphere thanks to the guitars, the portraits of the rock'n roll musicians who found haven in thus place.  It is an oasis in the middle of the city of Los Angeles with magnificent luxuriant gardens. There are hidden places with couches where you can read and smoke and relax. It oozes privacy in the different rooms. 2 elegant swimming pools. A great restaurant and a very helpful, welcoming, nice staff.</review>

<text>Just great. I had checked into Loews Hollywood which was awful and came across Sunset Marquis here. A world of difference and the way to experience LA. Very different from a stuffy hotel room! Also, staff are amazing - cool people who like their work, not angry robots like Loews.< /text>< name>

This is one of the only spots in LA where you can still smoke like a chimney, drink like a fish and not have to slum it.
It's a fantastic spot for upscale, milinals to  debauch among their peers.
It's also a hotel bar so if you meet someone worth spending some "quality time" with you can get a room.<//text>

This hotel is beautiful and situated in West Hollywood right on the sunset strip. It's calm and quiet, staff are very friendly and unobtrusive, service always timely. The two heated pools are great, we stayed in a pool-side suite and loved it. Minutes way from places like Hollywood Boulevard, The Grove, Beverly Center and other shopping and dining destinations.< /Text>

There now! In villa 31 (So this review is of that villa) which is a nice place to be, though you have to go out to the gardens to feel Los Angeles as the aesthetic of the interior design is  bland. High points are seclusion and the food and the pools. What i don't like is the lack of cohesion of the interior design and the feeling that its a club for anglo rock and rollers.</Text>

<Review>My wife and I spent five nights at Sunset Marquis and we really enjoyed our stay. The hotel room was large, with a really comfy bed and amazing walk in shower. Our room also had a large adjoining balcony, which was useful for afternoon drinks, overlooking the pool, and the occasional afternoon siesta.
We stayed from Monday to Saturday, so the atmosphere at the pool was pretty quiet during the week days and nights, however I assume, based on the Friday night and Saturday morning, that the atmosphere is a lot better on the weekend - perhaps making one's stay even more fun.
There was a slight problem upon check-out, where the valet charged us for three nights, rather than the actual one. (I wonder if this was intentional, to see if we wouldn't notice). However, this was rectified immediately.
The front counter staff were terrific. Our flight out of LA was not til midnight, and checkout was at midday. They took our bags and kept them securely, allowing us to explore the city for the next several hours, and come back and chill by the pool until it was time to go to the airport.
I'd definitely recommend this hotel to couples of families looking to have a fun and relaxing time in West Hollywood. The hotel is beautiful, and the room is comfortable. It is a bit on the pricey side, but hey - it's Hollywood!</Review>< Resp>

Really nice hotel. It's expensive but I love the decor and layout. They have that little secret garden in the middle. A nice restaurant outside, a bar inside. It has a very Hollywood vibe. Very sunny California. Highly recommend it.< /review>

Beautiful hotel in the middle of Hollywood that lets you get away from the hustle and bustle. Elegant, but not pretentious or gaudy. The staff is amazing, from the valet and front desk to the bartenders and restaurant. The rooms are generous and have a personal, apartment feel. I could not more highly recommend the Sunset Marquis.< /Review>

Sidenote: this may be a nitpick but it may help some readers: staff is fine, but don’t expect to treated like you will at most other hotels in the $800-$1,200 per night range. Something just a little off with the staff, couldn’t quite put my finger on it but I guess it just seemed like they were sort of arrogant.

The property truly is an oasis in the midst of West Hollywood!  Equally impressive was our Villa!  I would highly recommend Sunset Marquis to anyone staying in LA and I would recommend it as a destination trip if you don't have plans to visit LA anytime soon!<//review>< Pictures>

<Review>Best hotel stay ever. The rooms are modern and comparable to other hotels, but what makes this hotel is the service. It is first class and genuine all the way. From the moment we arrived EVERY person we met - valet, the bell hop, front desk, bartenders, managers, maintenance, room service, poolside service - were all welcoming and helpful, but not in a fake or uppity way. It truly made for a magical stay. The only downside is that this has made my husband and I hotel snobs. WE have stayed at several very high end hotels since then and they simply do not compare. We cant wait to come back. We LOVE the Sunset Marquis. Thank you!< /Review><name>Travelocity reviewer< /name><date>1297123200000</date>< Gmap_id>

Nice hotel but beware of hidden charges. We stayed for 2 nights and weren't aware of breakfast not being included in our package, nor wifi or parking. You are not told this at check in and overall our stay cost us $300 dollars more than we were expecting. It would be fine if you were told. If you are hoping to keep your car there beware the parking costs $40 a night.
The rooms are nice but the above leaves a bad taste at check out - pricing needs to be transparent.< /Text>

Te bathroom has lips that glow when the light is off! :) my overall stay was great! I was barely at the hotel because I was out doing the tourists stuff but the decor and vibe were right on point. I absolutely love that they're doing there part to be more green :) it's located in a good area, close to everything. I would definitely come back!<//Text>< rating>

<Text>Dinner at the Sunset Marquis was wonderful.  As a group of 6 people, we all shared appetizers and enjoyed every one of them.  All plates were empty by the end of the night, and the service was second to none.  The restaurant is quaint, quiet, and beautiful with an abundance of tropical vegetation.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>I’ve stayed at almost every hotel boutique hotel and resort  in Los Angeles and Palm Springs and this is probly in my top 3 hotels. This place is exquisite with there attention to details I stayed in a bungalow and would recommend you do the same it’s the only way to go. You would never know this beautiful hotel and small jungle was even there it’s sitting in the middle of everything but when inside you feel as secure and secluded as ever. Def recommend staying here.</text>< Pics>

A very tranquil quiet zen place in the heart of Sunset Strip. You will be whisked away by several things: the beautiful green landscaping, the black and white photographs of the legends of music and acting who have dined or stayed there and the serenity and quiet.

There are numerous comfortable sitting areas throughout the hotel, as well as benches placed in garden areas. It was wonderful to be able to sit and enjoy the beauty of it all, and close my eyes to hear the trickling fountains - without the noise of traffic or other city distractions.

The restaurant, Cavatina, is an indoor outdoor dining establishment. Be sure to check out the photo at the entrance of the restroom - I found it quite humorous :-) Food and service excellent. There is a lounge by the pool and and the entrance (Bar 1200), as well as a small cocktail area at the restaurant. And, there is a spa!

This hotel is not located on main road of this area. It is at the end of cul de sac surrounded by several luxury apartment houses, accordingly a "hidden gem". There is a rich history here; the hotel has undergone a number of changes since 1970s party days, and some of the history is evident by their "wall of fame"! Be sure to check out Morrison Gallery, which has rotating exhibits on various musicians.

I look forward to my next visit! Excellent service, I felt like a VIP from moment I entered to the time I left - worth every dime for the tranquil zen feeling!< /Text>

The staff is here is superb and very friendly. We stayed in a suite for my friend's birthday and arrived to champagne and chocolate covered strawberries flecked with goldv and more. The suite was gorgeous and I spent a more than a few minutes in the bathtub wondering how I could sneak said tub out the door.
I didn't go in the bar, but met a very friendly gentleman outside of it while walking my dog. So if you're single or want to record a hit song at their all-night recording studio, this is the place for you!< /Review>

The staff, location, food, and amenities are incredible.   The staff takes care of your every need.  If it is not at the hotel, they will make sure to get it for you.  It is worth every cent to stay at this remarkable place. I think they should call it a "Resort" instead of hotel!  I've stayed here 3 times and wont stay anywhere else when in LA.
Yes, there are celebrities here....but by the time you check out.....with the way you are treated.....you feel like one yourself!<//review>

Delicious restaurant, but the rooms need soundproofing. Any door that closed in the corridor echoed through my room, the walls were so thin I could hear everything my neighbors were saying, and the doors kept out none of the hallway conversations. I'd eat there again, but not stay overnight.</review>

From the start of the trip the service was top notch. Upon arrival the staff was truly friendly and attentive and ALWAYS A SMILE ON THEIR FACE. My wife and I posted up for the weekend in a newly renovated Deluxe Junior Suite. Try the Chateau instead, that is a much classier environment.< /Text>

I love the Marquis. Such comfortable beds, such a great vibe, awesome rooms, friendly staff, it has almost everything. The one draw back is that --in 2019 when wifi is free everywhere--they STILL charge you for it. It is ridiculous that a hotel this nice doesn't have wifi included.< /text>

Superb but wear something warm when the sun goes down if you're drinking by the pool.  Morrison Gallery is superb - Rock and Roll photos from the classic days.  We bought a superb book by the legendary photographer Terry O'Neill (former husband of Faye Dunaway, who I met at O'Neill's studio behind Harrods once!).  She was charming.  And about those drinks...they were strong, just like a good Rock Star prefers.  Cheers!<//Review>

The front desk staff never looks up to say hi when you walk in and out and every other detail is just as overlooked. The rooms are totally fine, basic 4 star hotel rooms. The water in the shower changes temperature about every 2 minutes but otherwise there’s nothing fundamentally wrong with the dates bathrooms. Facility wise it’s pretty underwhelming.. doesn’t have its own gym, small pool, and very basic little bar. Where it truly fails is in service. Just awful. They call themselves a 4.5 star hotel .. there’s no complimentary water in the rooms and getting what’s in the mini bar refilled takes days, they still charge for WiFi which is rare to see at a hotel of this class these days, and when you put our breakfast menu on the door with a time frame it means nothing to them. This morning they brought  my pot of coffee (and that’s  all I ordered) 20 minutes early therefore waking me up and said it was because they were so busy they wanted to make sure I didn’t have to wait. Why would I have to wait when that’s the point of ordering it the night before.  I would say this place isn about the equivalent to a lower end Marriott.. no attention to detail, not one special factor, and super basic.<//Review>< pics>

The staff was amazing and went beyond any expectations I had. You are a very short walk from Sunset Boulevard and the music venues and bars. I can't say enough wonderful things about the Sunset Marquis. I would suggest you stay here should you ever need a get away in West Hollywood.<//text>

I travel frequently and only stay at 4 star or better hotels. I must say we had the most trouble experience staying here. This place and their staff to their guest all seem extremely weird. So if you are not a rock and roll or a movie start reject or a hippie DO NOT stay here. Waste of money.
Ironically when we arrived, I asked the bell guy what does he think about Sunset Marquis. His response. "not sure what to tell you, I guess you have to experience it yourself" I should've known then not to check in.<//text>

<GmapID>0x80c2bebc5d279a47:0xf9b14eb420658c35< /GmapID><Text>Waited a long time to check in, until almost 3.30pm and that was despite having pre-alerted the Sunset Marquis of a slightly earlier arrival time.Room ok but carpet absolutely filthy, to the point where I could not walk around barefoot as the carpet left a grimey film on the soles of my feet and blackened them.No service in the tiny bar, restaurant closed very early. Some of the staff borderline on being rude and arrogant. Valet guys and a couple of the girls in reception were kind and friendly though.Received an unwanted wake up call at 4am on my last night. Advised staff of this at check out and they apologised and offered free breakfast but could not take advantage of this due to time constraints.Overall, a very disappointing experience.... Fork out a little extra and stay in a real hotel like the Beverly Hills Hotel, the Beverly Hilton or Chateau Marmont instead.<//Text>< pictures>

< review>
I went over to the Sunset Marquis last night to catch up with some old friends that where in town for a few days from Florida. My friend was very excited that she got her picture taken with Steven Tyler the night before and she told me that I would love the place.

I was on my motorcycle so I didnt have to deal with the valet parking / lack of street parking fiasco that all car drivers have to deal with so I cruised right up and parked up front. I found my friends in the back at the restaurant bar and they started to take me for a tour.

This is a high end rock n roll hotel through and through. There is a recording studio on the facility called NightBird Recording Studios. Some heavy stuff has gone down here at the studios and here are a few artists that have recorded here.

Aerosmith
Billy Idol
Dave Navarro
Elton John
Gene Simmons
George Clinton
Heart
Madonna
Phil Collins
Ozzy Osbourne ... and that is just a few of the names.

I walked around and checked out both of the pools and checked out some of the nice villas. This place is really high end and is within walking distance of the Sunset strip. Very Cool!

We had a few cocktails at the bar downstairs and they played tons of old 70s rock which was awesome and it was loud! The place reaked of Nag Champa which was also a nice touch.</review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Excellent hotel a short walk from Sunset Boulevard, but placed in a quiet location and just a little tight. Historically, it is the favorite place for rock stars who have started to attend it systematically since the 1960s, starting with the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. All rooms are spacious mini suites, overlooking the first of the two pools. The garden also hosts mini villas even more exclusive and eccoglienti. Impeccable service, a quality restaurant in a beautiful setting, polite and friendly staff.

(Original)
Eccellente hotel a due passi dal Sunset Boulevard, ma collocato in una posizione tranquilla e solo di poco defilata. Storicamente, è il locale prediletto dalle rockstar che a partire dagli anni Sessanta hanno iniziato a frequentarlo sistematicamente, a cominciare dai Beatles e dai Rolling Stones. Tutte le camere sono delle spaziose mini suites, affacciate sulla prima delle due piscine. Il giardino poi ospita mini villette ancora più esclusive ed eccoglienti. Servizio impeccabile, un ristorante di qualità in un ambiente stupendo, personale gentile e cordiale.<//Review>

<Review>Sehr freundliches und beflissenes Personal, durchgehend vom Valet parking über Concierge, Empfang wie auch der Zimmerservice bis hin zum Reinigungspersonal. Die Einrichtugen sind gepflegt und sauber. Die Zimmer sind frisch renoviert und modern eingerichtet. Der Pool ist gepflegt und sauber. Wir haben uns in den drei Tagen dort sehr wohl gefühlt. Das Hotel ist, bezogen auf Zimmer und Lage, sehr preiswert.Das angeschlossene Restaurant ist geschmackvoll eingerichtet und hat eine gute internationale Küche.Insgesamt sehr empfehlenswertes Hotel. Es ist wirklich eine Oase der Ruhe mitten in Hollywood.< /Review>< userid>

Da uns größere Hotelketten weniger überzeugen können, wir aber dennoch einen zentralen Platz in Los Angeles bewohnen wollten, entschieden wir uns für dieses kleine, sehr gemütliche Hotel im Herzen von West Hollywood. Das Sunset Marquis wird zudem vermehrt als Insidertipp aufgeführt - ein weiterer Grund, der unsere Entscheidung erleicherte. Wir - als shoppingwütige Frauen (wie könnte es auch anders sein :)) und leidenschaftliche Tanzmäuse konnen uns wirklich nicht vorstellen, dass ein Hotel besser für unsere Lieblingsaktivitäten geeignet wäre. Das Hotel liegt im Schnittpunkt der berühmten Shoppingstraßen Rodeo Drive, Melrose Avenue, Robertson Boulevard etc., der zumindest zurzeit beliebtesten Ausgehmöglichkeiten (Hyatt, Teddys, Les Deux, Green Door etc.) - und besten Restaurants (Spago, Dolce, Geisha House, Social, STK etc.) Wer jedoch das süße Strandleben favorisert oder an einem gediegenen Familienurlaub interessiert ist, sollte sich besser andere Gegenden wie Santa Monica oder Malibu aussuchen.<//Text>

<review>Wer mit Musik oder Kunst zu tun hat, kann sich der Energie, die das Sunset Marquis umgibt, nicht entziehen. Es handelt sich definitiv um KEIN Designer-Hotel. Die Gänge zu den Zimmern wirken schon sehr in die Jahre gekommen ... aber sobald man die Zimmertür öffnet, sagt man: Jawohl ! Große, geräumige Zimmer mit Bar, Eiskasten, super bequemem Bett ...Die Bar ist legendär ... einer der Szene-Treffs in Hollywood. Da trinkt man häftg mal ein Glas neben Al Pacino oder ähnlichen Kalibern. In Sunset ist das aber norman. Keiner fragt um ein Autogramm. Der Pool im Innenhof ist sehr gepflegt. Das hoteleigene Restaurant ist eines der besten der Stadt ... hat aber auch seinen Preis ...Bemerkenswert: Auch im ärgsten Trubel der Hochsaison: Wenn man das Sunset Marquis betritt, ist man in einer Oase der Ruhe & Kreativität.Die Hotelmitarbeiter sind extram freundlich & bemüht.Rundum ein Wohlfühlhotel ...<//review><response>None<//response>< Pics>

<Review>In einer Seitenstraße liegt das Hotel. Es ist sehr versteckt und deswegen ein wenig weg vom Trubel auf dem Sunset und Santa Monica Boulevard.

<Review>(Translated by Google) I stayed in this hotel for three days with my grandchildren (teenagers)
We had rooms in the small villas which are extremely nice, very clean, quiet and comfortable
The restaurant is of good quality and the setting very pleasant

Hotel staff are just amazing

Thank you again to them for the very efficient help they gave me when I noticed the day before our departure that I had forgotten the passports in the previous hotel where we were staying near San Diego and allowed us to collect them in the middle of the night .
Thank you also for their kind attention to wish me my birthday

If we go back to Los Angeles ... no doubt we will go back to Sunset Marquis

(Original)
J'ai séjourné dans cet hôtel pendant trois jours avec mes petits-enfants (adolescents)
Nous avions des chambres dans les petites villas qui sont extrêmement agréables , très propres , calmes et confortables
Le restaurant est de bonne qualité et le cadre très agréable

Le personnel de l'hôtel est juste extraordinaire

Encore merci à eux pour l'aide très Efficace qu'ils m'ont apportée lorsque je me suis aperçu la veille de notre départ avoir oublié les passeports dans l'hôtel précédent ou nous résidions près de San Diego et nous avoir permis de les récupérer en pleine nuit .
Ét merci également pour leur délicate attention pour me souhaiter mon anniversaire

Si nous retournons à Los Angeles ... aucun doute nous retournerons au sunset marquis< /Review>< Date>

I enjoyed the stay in Sunset Marquis very much. The perfect hideaway, very calm, but yet in one of the best location in L.A. (West Hollywood), close to Sunset Blvd. I had a two room appt., the furniture wasnt really new, but everything was alright to me. I slept very well in this really cosy King-Bed. The Restaurants offers really good food, on Sunday there is a Brunch. The atmosphere is really like it is described on the Homepage. I definitely had a blast during my stay in L.A., the Sunset Marquis was a part of it. And btw, the staff is absolutely amazing, always friendly, always willing to help and to organise required things. Next time Ill be there again.</Text>
