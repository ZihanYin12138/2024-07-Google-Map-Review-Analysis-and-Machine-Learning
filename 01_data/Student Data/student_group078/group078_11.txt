I was able to get in and out in less than an hour.  The SSA employee was friendly, knowledgeable, and courteous.  He worked at window number 3. The key is to get there  early  and have all your documents, i.e. ID,SS card etc.  The only negative was the long line to get to the service window.< /review>

< Review>
The people who work here are friendly and polite. The wait time can be quite long, but this will vary; you may want to plan for at least 4 hours. You will need to bring your S.S. Card the 1st time; after that you'll be in the system. You will need to bring your own notebook if you want anything to write on because they won't provide you with a piece of paper to use. It's best to have your questions written down before you go. They do have a booklet that has some of the answers on S.S. I lost a $40 sweathirt in this office (I dropped it) and went back to look for it in 1 hour, but it was gone and the security officers couldn't find it. This place is at risk for theft so take care with what you bring.</Review>

Showed up at 0830, there was already a line in front of the building. If you don’t have an appointment better show up early. Security comes out about 0845 to give a brief. If you have an appointment, are getting a change of name or a replacement card, you will be taken out of line and put in a different line. This line will go in the building first. I was there for a name change, it went smoothly. Security is nice and the woman who helped me was very nice. Another reviewer complained about having her purse searched. This is a federal building so weapons of any kind are not allowed. It is for everyone’s protection from the weirdos in the world. From the time the doors opened to the time I was done, it was only 7 minutes. Not bad at all!<//Review>

I've been to this office on many different occasions. And my review through out the year's is this is a very busy office serving the whole high dessert and sometimes it's fast & sometimes slow, just be clear what your there for so you will get the right worker. These people in this office have been kind and extreemly helpful. It may take a long time befor your called, but that being said means that they will also take there time helping you also! 👏</Text>

Mr. Bristol Windows 7 mr. Perez window 8 denied me a supervisor after waiting two hours had me waiting about 30 more minutes.security wants to get all crazy with me because simply I went up to the window and asked for their names that's all I did and came back down and sat down I have the right to know the employees names to report them when they're not doing their jobs right or I have a complaint it's both of the security guards want to be top flight security. Trying to threaten me that they're going to kick me out your not scary nobody there doing nothing but security guards you're not cops</text>

<name>evelyn buehler< /name><Review>Long waiting time .They are so slow and take their sweet time to give you their service . Most government employees do because no matter what ,they are secured already and have good benefits .so they don’t really care even though their salary is paid by tax money of the people they served. When you call also takes time to answer . In either way , their service needs lots rooms for improvement.<//Review></record>

If u live in the high desert please do not go to this office. The people that work there are rude and don’t know what the HELL theyre doing. We When there to talk to someone about my Dad’s social Security and took more than 3 hrs to see someone and at the end they could help much. If u do go there make sure u get everything in writing so u have prove that u went and talk to someone.<//text>

No one does their job here. I've been denied my benefits for 3 months despite being told I'm 100 percent approved. Ive watched them type my information in and say everything would work out yet weeks later I found out they didnt ever complete or submit my information. They lose forms, and are quite rude. Its a terrible excuse for a place people depend on to get by. And every time I call they say thet have zero representatives availible. They make everything about the experience awful.<//text>

I myself lost my husband of 60 years and had to wait over 4 hours just to show them an original death certificate. I was finally called back only to be told I had to give a statement to someone else.

<review>The fact that they close early on a random day like Wednesday and take 45 minutes to answer phone calls just tells you how much they care about helping people, and conflict of interest.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I went to the social security office when it first opened in the morning and I wasn't seen until 5 hours later. It was slower than the DMV.< /Review>

Slow service via the phone or even in the office it takes HOURS. I avoid going into the building all together though because it takes FOREVER to be seen.  I'm from MN though, where it takes 15 mins from walking in the door to be seen, max.  This California office is insanely under staffed.<//Review>

Wait in a line to get a number to wait in a line, then your number is called so they can tell you they are placing you in another line. Makes sense I guess...<//Review>

<review>Chili Verde skillet. Had a mild heat, enough to keep it interesting. The other dish was Southwest Chicken skillet, grilled chicken, onions, red and green peppers too. Added some Cholula sauce to spice it up. Friendly staff and owners.</review>< pics>

Food was good. My family and me were visiting Bakersfield for a wedding. Needed a place for breakfast and came by here twice. The server (never got her name) she was nice and patient with us. (There was like 7 of us, 3 were children) definitely will stop by again when in town.<//text>

Super patient server, food was really fresh. Gravy might have been a little bland, and maybe undercooked. I can still taste the flour in it. But I am grateful for the opportunity to actually eat in the restaurant again!</text>

Food and service was mediocre. Nothing special about it. You’re better off going to Denny’s or ihop.<//text>

Always pleased when I ordered here. Food is prepared well and presented nice and always hot.

The customer service I have received every time I pick up my food is off the charts. I hope the manager and it owner appreciates the staff.

I only show up ever month or so since they opened and the young lady the seats people always greets me by name and with much respect. I believe she is now a server. She deserves it for sure as she has the right kind of customer facing service.

The wait staff have been great, the food is always good and not once have I ever had an issue with my food. I say a win win< /text>

Skillets has great portions for a good price. The service can use improvement but I do recognize that is a new establishment.< /Review>

I love this place.  My wife and I eat here minimum every two weeks.  Food is fairly priced and menu is big enough for plenty of options.  The staff is excellent and we are greeted by the ladies every time. We walk in.  We have never had a bad experience or slow service.  Wait times have been minimal.<//review>

<text>New, clean, open and friendly. Reasonably priced. Coffee great. Service excellent.

Skillet made with old cold potatoes. Meat was a mushy mess. All three of us had room temp  eggs. Hash browns raw in the center.
I'll give them one more chance.< /text>< username>

I'm so happy this place is here! I was hopeful on my first visit, as it's in a busy area that needed a good eatery. Great prices, super friendly staff, delicious food, vaulted ceilings that keep the nice level at "can still have a conversation" levels, even when it's crowded. I've been back a few times since they opened, 3 months ago, and this is definitely going to be my go-to place. Eat here.  You won't regret it. 😉<//Review>

<Rate>3< /Rate><review>The Skillets Diner is new to Bakersfield and on Sunday May 26, we tried out their breakfast.

On the positive side, we found the coffee delicious and the atmosphere was pleasant. While we waited for our meals, our drinks were refilled on a very frequent basis. My wife ordered the French toast with an egg and bacon on the side. She remarked how everything was delicious. I ordered the Denver omelet with hashbrowns, a side of bacon and rye toast. The omelette was cooked to my satisfaction and the hash browns and bacon were done as asked. Instead of regular rye toast, I was presented with Marble Rye, a pleasant surprise. All in all, everything on the plate was very good.

On the negative side, service was very slow, but that’s to be expected with a new opening. It took over 45 minutes from the time we were seated before we received our meals. During this time, I noticed several people who had been waiting, left before they were seated. Perhaps the empty area in the middle of the establishment will soon be utilized in the future to accommodate more people.

We suspect that once the kinks are worked out, the Skillets Diner will be a pleasing experience for many years to come. We will certainly be back.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80ea438dc0fae2d9:0x3722d5e86d45c078<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Fairly new restaurant. Good service, great food, prices are fair although $7 for a stack pancakes is a bit much. But still a great place to eat.</text>

Was greeted upon entry and seated immediately. Waitress friendly. Food arrived quickly and was still HOT. She came and checked on us and brought Bill promptly. Food was excellent.< /Text>

<Review>My skillet was dynamite! The Santa Fe skillet! My wife was amazed it didn't come with toast but my doctor wants me to avoid bread anyway! Didn't notice it until I read the menu later but it didn't have green onions as advertised! My wife had a butcher meat burrito that she said was off tasting. We'll go back and try again! Lot more room for tables and on mellow days maybe outside on the small patio area!< /Review><UserId.>104555250557784803959</UserId.><gmapID>0x80ea438dc0fae2d9:0x3722d5e86d45c078< /gmapID><pics>None< /pics><Rate>4</Rate><Date>1563760941341</Date><Name>Chris Mattson</Name>< resp>

First visit to Skillets and it was an A+ all around. Very clean, not overly noisy, friendly waitress and the food was excellent. In fact, such large portions we each brought food home for later.<//Text>

<Review>First time here and last. I put 2 stars because the prices and menu are really good.
BUT.... the service is really bad the waitress was kinda friendly but she only came to our table to take the order and bring it back.... she didnt offer refills or check on us at all.... when she brought the food we ask for toast and extra gravy for my husbands breakfast skillet and she came back after he finish his food and i almost finished mine.... 😒
Dennys service is better than here and i dnt even like the service at Dennys 🤨< /Review>< user_id>

<Rating>3< /Rating><Review>Not much seating. If tables were arranged differently they could put more tables and not have so many people leave. When you go in it is a mass confusion as the hostess is trying to greet customers and clear tables, put silverware and sest customers while the owner or manager stands back and watches and chit chats  with some servers that look like family. The owner or manager should be going around and talking to customers interacting. Now for the food it was okay.  I got french toast combo which has 3 slices of french toast not cut in half whole slices of bread which had a different taste than any I have ever had but was ok. My husband had a chorizo skillet which had more potatoes than eggs and doesn't come with toast. The food was like warm, not a great experience. Won't be back gave you a try will be going to Renaes  food and service is a lot better.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>This place couldn't make my custom omelette.

Every new diner I go to i have them make the same thing.

1. Asked for an omelette
Inside- spinach, onion, jalapeno
Outside- tomatoes, avocado
2. Biscuit and gravy
3. short stack of pancakes

First they don't serve biscuit and gravy by it's self. You have to get 2 eggs with it. Gravy is heavy on pepper, light on the sausage and fat. The biscuit was just gross... might of been frozen.

Hashbrowns were burned on 1 out of 3 dishes.

Last and most important was they forgot the spinach on my omelette. I did point it out to my waitress and she offered to bring me a side bowl of spinach and I tried to explain to her that just putting spinach onto with the avocado and tomatoes wouldn't be nearly as good and I asked her to have them remake it. By the time it came back they just dumped the spinach on top of the avocado and tomatoes. I refused the dish and left without eating it.

11:30am= arrive and wasit to be seated
12:00pm= seated and drink order taken
12:05pm= drinks arive
12:15pm= order taken
12:45pm= coffee refilled
1:00pm= coffee refilled
1:15pm= asked if we needed anything and apologise for the wait
1:30pm= food arrived and sent back omelette
1:32pm= omelette come back wrong
2:00pm= got the check
2:15pm= they took payment.

This was there first weekend but they just were not ready... cooks and waitresses just not in the grove and the food just wasn't worth the cost or wait. Might try again in a mo nth and see if the do any better.

For now they get one star for service and quality and speed of food.</Text>< pictures>

There is limited seating since their shop is kind of small but o usually just take my items to go.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Love this place! If I could give them 10 Stars I would. Amazing Desserts! They  look as good as they taste.  And the people are very nice.  If you want to impress your lady or kids with a memorable desert this is the place! Check them out. Plus they are next to my favorite smoke shop. Plus!< /Review>

I really love this place. They have all our favorites. Most of the time, the service and quality of snack is up to par. Today, I did get a dud with the chamoy covered Apple. The Apple turned and was acidy. With that said my family and I have enjoyed many Tostimango, Chamango, Fesas con Crema y  Nieve, among other favorites.< /text>

Carmelita's always have great customer service, very friendly, they make you feel at home.
This place has a variety of delicious things, so many it's hard to choose from! Their Crepes with ice cream and fresh fruit and the Tostiesquites are our favorites!</review>

This is the best snack shop in Vista. Their menu is large, but the quality is what really makes this place stand out. Everything from the elote to the fruit cups are outstanding. I am making it my goal to eat everything from their menu. The only downside is that there is always a wait if they are making you something. The plus side of the wait is that your food is made with love and is high quality.< /text>

<Time>1544592638178< /Time><review>Carmelita’s has a *delicious* variety of desserts. But don’t come here expecting a quick desert, since they take about 10 minutes average to assemble an order. This is because it takes time to make their delicious + good looking treats. Carmelitas was my favorite place to get a chamango. And I say “was” because unfortunately on my last trip as I was indulging in my chamango I was very grossed out to find a medium length brown hair in the middle of my desert. I could not finish my treat out of disgust. This made me question their cleanliness, it makes me so very sad to say I don’t think I can go back because of what happened. It’s a real shame because their shop has such yummy creations.</review>< Resp>

<text>This place just hit me with a debt from 5 years ago for services that I never used. Absolutely terrible establishment. Do no recommend their gym to anybody, unless you enjoy being scammed, lied to, and taken advantage of. I will never do business with them again.< /text>< pics>

This place was kind enough to give me a 7 day pass to try it out but I came in on a Saturday at 12:00 pm which is clearly within there staffed hours and there was nobody here to let me in. I don't know if I would recommend this gym after this experience. If that's the way they do business than there is something  clearly wrong with management.</text>

<Text>Tried to enter the Gym but my key fob didn't work. So, I tried two more times. Still no entry. I go online to check my account says I'm paid and should be good to go. I've been a member for 3 years and don't see what the problem is. I pay for my boyfriend to be a member too and his key worked fine. This happened after hours so there was no one to address the situation.</Text>< Gmap_id>

Wow. This place is awful. Way too crowded, not a very large selection of machines. I was on the stair stepper and was actually bumping arms with the person next to me.
The bathroom had no hot water for a shower...
Just way too over crowded.</text>

<review>Its so funny that someone said NO SHOWERS. There are 2 private showers here at the Riverwalk location. Also the person who said we are open 8-5 when we are ANYTIME FITNESS. Yes we are staffed 9-6 but the gym is open 24/7 for members. I wish people would actually comment about the gym and not false stuff :)</review><response>None<//response><date>1535410647951</date><Name>ANYTIME FITNESS RIVERWALK<//Name><userid>118244142829439277207<//userid><pics>None</pics><Rate>5<//Rate>< gmapID>

Santa Clarita HARLEY-DAVIDSON...You guys Rock!  I personally want to thank Kevin and his team (Earnie, Marcie, Kelly) for giving me the VIP treatment and making my purchase super easy and fast.

Brought my bike in Saturday 8/22 with an appointment to get the Screamin Eagle auto tuner module installed on my SG CVO. The parts department had the tuner and service got my bike right in for the install. Total time in and out was 2 hours. Great job by everyone!! Thanks</review>

what a pleasant experience. I think her name is Avery(forgive me if I got it wrong) she was so kind and personable. She took time to help me find the perfect gift for my father. You don't meet people like her very often anymore in the costumer service industry, so THANK YOU. human kindness goes a long way.</Review>

Just bought my first Harley. Finally made the switch from Yamaha. The employees all made me feel welcome and they treated me like a serious buyer without being pushy at all the second I walked in the door. I dont think there was a single employee that didnt at least come by and ask how I was doing while I was there. They let me test ride two bikes and I left with a new 2020 Road King Special. Super easy buying experience. I can say it was my best buying experience out of all the bikes and cars I have purchased.</text>

love these guys, won't go to anywhere else. Great attitudes, very friendly, and I always like supporting people who setup shop in my neighborhood.

I've gone in to buy oil/parts as well as had major work done on my bike, and I'd recommend them to anyone. The whole crew really know their stuff.< /Text>

Owned by Glendale  Harley from what I was told.make me go from 4 stars to 2 just for that.was told bring bike in for service so I did ,when I arrived 1 person after another came up to help me out ....then after long explanations about who I am and why I'm there like I'm some lost boy I was finally told he has no time to just come back another day.This isn't like i made a appointment but i did just that and made sure all new i was coming to get my bike surviced.I thanked every one on the phone for the date and times which i held up to then when i got their I was questioned to who the hell i am.close that store down,there's a reason the vanise owner who ran it for over 10 years i believe ,went ahead and sold it.i didn't like Glendale Harley for refusing me service after forking out around $600 bucks already that day for tire replacement !!!!.i will stop going to these two harleys from now on.let it be heard that I'm a mechanic for over 20 years and would do the work my self as i always have but these people have my bike on the factory recall for petcock recall ,which is in legal obligation to install it.i requested to do it my self but laws are laws.these people in the mechanic parts of the place just suck.UPDATE 9/19 5pm yes it's your store ,part was shipped from Glendale to meet my distance as I live across the street.i just emailed you to see if my part has spider webs on it because, no I'm not the type to make a appointment and to then be told sorry when I get there.i work every day,I cant take time off of work you see.good day< /review>< pics>

<Review>Terrible service department.  Took my bike on a Tuesday for routine maintenance and was promised it would be ready by the end of the next day.  They hadn't even touched it when I came back at the end of the next day.  No phone call telling me it wasn't going to be ready.  Nothing.  The rep there that day promised he'd have it done the next day and "I don't make promises I can't keep."  Sorry, buddy, but you kinda already did.</Review><pictures>None</pictures>< user>

<Text>This is the worst Harley Davidson Dealership that I have ever been to in my life of riding Harleys. So as I walked in, the front door lady didn't even say hello, welcome to Harley Davidson or anything in that nature....she just looked at me then continued on into her phone...then I walked through and looked at the bikes and not even one salesman asked if I need help with anything....so I then went to the clothing area and the 2 girls that was behind the counter were just talking amongst themselves not even paying any attention to there area or guest arriving to there area. I literally walked right by them and didn't get a peep or a wave out of them. So after I figured I would not spend a dime of my money here....i then walked to the bathroom past through the bikes again...I actually got a look from the guy in the parts counter and that was it...nothing again from any salesman...and I came across the mechanics that were having a full on conversation right next to the bathrooms...and they just looked and continued on..smh...so yes this was the worst Harley dealership I have ever stepped foot in. They really don't even deserve 1 star< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1564599557854, 'text': 'We appreciate you taking a moment to review our dealership.

They rebuilt my engine twice in 6months and still didn't get it right. I fixed the oil leaks cuz they blew me off. After fixing the oil leaks, I noticed I was going through a quart of oil every 500 miles. No leaks, they didn't set the rings correctly and the oil is being blown out the tail pipe.</Text>

They advertise that Invisalign is 1,999 then when you go in they tell you it will be 6,000. How is that even close. Braces are cheaper. Don't waste your time going here. You can find Invisalign cheaper elsewhere.  I did!< /Text>

Visited Valley View after I was unsatisfied with the care I was receiving elsewhere. Karen and Denise at the front desk were very helpful in getting me on the schedule and giving me an understanding of what treatments could be done and how my insurance would cover it. The hygienists and doctors were great in keeping me in the know, step by step, with what they were doing. Far better than my previous dental care.</text>

I've been coming to this dentist for about 6 years and Doctor Yosh and everyone that work there are the nicest people and they work amazingly. They always make sure your okay and always tell you what's happening and what's going to happen, and give you advice on how to take better care of your teeth, and from my experience they are the best dentists I've ever had!<//review>

Staff was very friendly and efficient. Dr Yosh, Shawn, Daniel and Rocio were very helpful. They explained the procedure and helped me feel more calm and relaxing. Very clean and friendly environment. Highly recommend this place.< /review>

<review>The dentist is my worsted enemy, BUT Dr. Cheema made it so much easier! Very gentle and explains what he is doing. The staff is very friendly and the office is clean and friendly. I dread the dentist but after having a couple of procedures I highly recommend Valley View Dental and Dr. Cheema.</review>< Resp>

By far the most Money greedy dentist I have ever experienced. Falsely billed and maxed out my dental insurance claiming bunch of work that they need preformed on me.....which they did not. They lie about all the dental work that you immediately, which according to a second and third opinions from two other dentists were not true and most definitely unnecessary for me. My friends and colleagues experienced the same misfortune.< /text>

Dr. Cheers is great. He always finds a way to make me happy. I recently had some teeth pulled and am healing slower than I thought I would, and having some pain.  He was able to do some adjustments that relieved a lot of my pain/soreness.  I'm a happy camper.<//text>

"Dental X-rays give a very low dose of radiation to the mouth. There is some scatter of radiation and the potential for some radiation absorption by the nearby thyroid and other organs."</Review><user>114926605619319578212</user>< gmap_id>

Worst experience ever with the staff. Answering person named Rocio just cancelled my appointment because I was telling her that, as I was told, that the consultation was free and they still wanted to involve insurances. I thought free meant free. Also, my appointment was cancelled within less than 24 hrs. I should charge them the $35 that they would have charged me if it had been me the one cancelling the appointment. Don’t go here if you don’t want to deal with rude people like Rocio</Review>

Pulled pork was moist and delicious.  Portion was big. Got the meal with 2 sides. Corn bread was more like a corn cake, it was really good. Grilled veggies a bit salty for my taste. Had enough for leftovers, nice.
Bbq is the sweet kind, I like it. We also got the Pulled pork sandwich with Mac n cheese. Didn't know the portions would be so big and we also ordered a couple of tacos.  I guess we were hungry piggies.

Server was friendly and food came quickly.  No parking on site, only 1 spot.  Street parking though.
I'll go back if I'm in the area.< /Review>

I live in the inland empire and came out to LA for the day.... Checked out reviews for a good place to eat and decided to see what this place was all about. The environment is relaxed, the service was top notch and the food would puts the "zing" in amazing! Punches you in the face with flavor and makes you like it. Kudos to these guys, check them out.</Review>

Don't let the outside deceive you. The inside has a modern hipster feel too it. Good quality  food mostly BBQ with either 1 or 2 sides depending on the order. Great for get together with friends or family. Plus variety of tap beer.<//Text>

Food is fantastic...but they took combo plates off the menu for some unknown reason....That was the best way to sample all their food. We would go there for those offerings. Now we don't go as much Very stupid thing to do. Hopefully she'll smarten up!</Review>

Used The Hungry Pig for my son's first birthday luau, for about 70 people. Our guests LOVED IT. So delicious, the order was spot on and right on time. Because it's run by one person more or less, you just have to do *some* DIY with pick up and ordering in person, not on the phone/online. But it's worth it! So good.</review>

Off the beat but cool area.   ( the hipsters are  here !)
Service. Top notch
Food.  Pretty darn good.
Wife's plate
Tri-tip. The meat was  tender and cooked perfectly.  It came already drenched in BBQ sauce.  The sauce was a tad too sweet and a tad too much. Next time BBQ sauce on side . Fresh veggies=excellent , corn bread =perfect ..
I had the BBQ back ribs.  Pretty Damn good.  Not a huge portion but not a huge price.  I'll pass on the beans next time .
Overall very satisfied and will be coming back soon.
No beer :(.   Hopefully soon they add some good local drafts.</Review>< Pics>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>WOW this place has the kindest service ever. The guy taking your order was so sweet and polite... seriously never have I been talked to in such a courteous manner. He gave us recommendations and so we got the baby back ribs (just the ribs, I think it's 1 lb) with the sides mac n cheese, coleslaw and corn bread. The mac n cheese was DELICIOUS. Usually I don't like eating too much mac n cheese but for some reason, something is extra appealing about theirs. The coleslaw was great too - my bf said the coleslaw was his favorite out of the side dishes. I got the cornbread because of the yelp reviews and it didn't disappoint. Now onto the ribs, the only problem I had with it was the the ribs on the side were extra dry. It wasn't even pleasant at all to eat. But the ribs in the middle were cooked to perfection. If all the ribs tasted like the ones in the middle, then this place would've gotten 5 stars from me. Also, don't forget to use the sauces they provide! It makes the ribs taste 10000x better. Parking was easy for me since I came right before it closed, but I could see it being potentially difficult during the day. Also, I thought the location was kinda sketch at first since it's all homes surrounding it but it turns out to be a nice surprise!</Review>< user>

I thought they were well cooked and the meat had some good flavor. The ribs were pretty tender to where the meat easily fell of the bones nicely. For the sides I picked the coleslaw, which could have been a lot better, the BBQ beans were also good. I decided to add some of the BBQ sauce to the beans which gave it the right amount of flavor to it with a little spicy kick to it.

Looking forward to trying some of the other items on the menu.

Very quick and friendly service. I definitely will be returning to this place to quench my BBQ craving next time it arises.< /review>< Rate>

It's great BBQ for great prices. Keep in mind that the flavor does have a bit more of an asian flair to it.

Parking is not always the easiest so you'll have to find street parking in the residential areas. Worth the trip!<//Text>

It's the best BBQ around. The meats are flavorful and succulent. They offer a variety of side dishes including unique ones like curried potatoes. They offer several beers on tap. There are TV's to watch sports. And there is an outside patio. Street parking only.< /review>

The Hungry Pig is a great take on Pan-pacific take on America BBQ. Food and service were good. The Mac n cheese was a little dry. Ribs were great with there Rosemary and garlic seasonal veggies. Bathroom should be a little cleaner.<//text>

This place is so good! It's a little hard to find and they only have street parking but the food is amazing. They have great sides, like curried potatoes and spicy coleslaw. But that doesn't even compare to the fall off the bone bbq, everything they sell here is to die for. I've dinned in and done take out, both were excellent. They have beer on tap and tv's.</Review>

<Review>What a great find. The brisket was delicious, moist and smokey. My wife got the pulled pork and it was also a good choice. You add toppings like chipotle and I was down with that. I recommend the onion marmalade, Asian slaw and sweet bbq sauce. I will be back for sure. This is a unique twist on bbq. The guy behind the counter was very helpful since it was our first time and they played reggae which is near and dear to my heart. Jah blessings bredren< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Great pork belly & baby back ribs. There is some serious chef-ery going on here. A few unique items...like warm curried potatoes and spicy eggplant salad. The pork belly was served on toothsome zucchini, and I'm not sharing the ribs.</Review>

Their beef tacos, though not advertised, are one of the best items on the menu! Fried chicken sandwiches are a bit over done. BBQ items are the way to go.< /review>

<rating>4<//rating><review>The ribs are amazing as is the beef brisket and bbq chicken. The sides are good, but I would have ordered a plate of ribs with two sides of ribs if they let me. The only thing that would have topped the whole thing off is if they served IBC cream soda or root beer. I'm not sure why but I was craving one to wash down this meal.</review><Pics>None<//Pics><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

<Review>This place was so refreshing and nice to come to on Sunday superbowl, when you don't like all of the hype of a big crowded and loud restaurant and just wanna relax. It looks pretty basic on the outside first time seeing it, but it won't disappoint. The service was nice and friendly, and food came really quick. Nice classic BBQ menu with all the classic sides, without the lines, waits, crowd and fuss. The food is BOMB, and hits the spot if your craving that classic charred BBQ flavor.

The meat is not overly cooked and tough, and is fall off the bone. The BBQ beans are peeerfect, I'd say the cornbread was different as it wasn't sweet at all like traditionally flavored corn bread but it's still good. Tried everything from what we ordered and it was all good. Mmmhmmm. :) Will be coming back. No cons here.< /Review>< pics>

<Review>We've eaten here twice now. The food is consistently terrible. As in inedible.
From the ribs (which we didn't eat) to the mac & cheese, they get it really wrong.
I'm confused by the positive reviews on Yelp as this place is really really bad.
We frequent Bludsoe's on La Brea which is amazing and resorted to The Hungry Pig a second time as we live in the area.<//Review>< pics>

<text>We ate at this place today and at was absolutely delightful, I had the Beef Curry with Brown Rice and my friend Rebecca had the Baby Back Ribs, Mmmm Yum and we also had a side of Beef Brisket. I feel it is my duty to inform you that The Hungry Pig is by far one of the BEST eating establishments in the whole Los Angeles area, that Rebecca and I have the honor dining at in the past year. We were so pleased to meet Edie the owner who is so kind, charming and down to earth, and Josh also a very handsome polite, and courteous server. The Hungry Pig is in Echo Park, Ca. and if you're in the area please make it a point to eat there. as for us, we live very close by and most definitely this hungry pig will be seeing a lot more of that Hungry Pig. Edie I give you a big 10. Oh! and can't wait to eat at The Rustic Spoon in NOHO.<//text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The shop that happened by chance, the typical American flavor, sweet and salty, especially the baby pork rib, the outer focus is tender, just right, give five stars~

The food came quickly, everyone was so nice. All in all, just what awesome. We just paid $ 35 for a great dinner. Definetely 5/5.

Absolutely recommended. Cheap, delicious and friendly staff at the same time. At the same time very cheap, for 15 € you get superior food. In Germany, something comparable would certainly cost at least 25 €. Definitely recommended, even if it is slightly out of the way worth the way.

Absolut zu empfehlen. Günstig, sehr lecker und freundliches Personal zugleich. Gleichzeitig sehr günstig, für 15 € bekommt man überragendes Essen. In Deutschland würde etwas vergleichbares sicherlich mindestens 25€ kosten. Definitiv zu empfehlen, auch wenn es leicht außerhalb liegt lohnt sich der Weg.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c76c794da345:0x38fda4279a588463<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I never thought this pet shop would be a huge help for me. Everything when it comes to pets was all right here! They strive to provide us the best service that exceeds our expectations. I couldn't ask for more! I won't hesitate to advise this place to my colleagues for their pets. Awe-inspiring.<//text>

This store is walking distance from my apartment so my pup Sasha and I are regulars. The stock a wonderfully comprehensive selection of food, treats, grooming supplies, bedding, toys, and more. They also have an in-house vet and a self-service dog wash area. Super convenient, as sometimes Sasha gets really muddy at the dog park!< /review>

<review>Great for picking up supplies quickly. Our Petco in Emeryville closed, and this place is smaller but faster. Also, there is no live animals here unlike original Petco stores, so it does not stink. Basically a cleaner and quicker way of shopping supplies from Petco.</review>< Pics>

Great friendly boutique pet store without the boutique prices. You can find the healthiest tastiest treats n dog food here. My dogs coats and skin are amazing. They are 12 and everyone comments "what cute puppies". staff is always friendly kind n knowledgable.I buy the Merrick but all thee brands seem elevated from your standard.</Review>

<text>There was not a large variety of product, smaller establishment than Petco. They do have washroom (at this moment washroom is closed). Picked up aspirin for dogs. No animals for sale, and clean establishment.</text>< user_name>

<Text>This place is great! Super friendly, knowledgeable staff who have been super kind and generous with their time and attention to my frightened rescue dog. I love that I can try things to find out what he likes, and bring it back if he doesn't. VERY helpful, since I bought the wrong sizes of many things, and he's picky about treats.<//Text><gmapID>0x808f80c49109837d:0xd2678473aa08169</gmapID><username>Rhus V<//username>< Date>

I saw less then what the Original Petco store carryed: the quality of food-100% natural eatables was absent, toys to phoney in nature, the lighting was dark (alarming); self cleaning basin-oversized udoodle in it. Nothing was usable or workable. Sorry, if i wrong but it had a boring mood and the employees looked at you as you were a suspect.  Where is the love?</Text>

Absolutely everyone that works here is friendly and knowledgeable and treats are dog so well. Jen's training classes are amazing and our dog is always so excited to see her. Wasn't planning to do our classes at a pet store, but after meeting Jen on a store visit, we knew she'd be the best.</text>

I had a horrendous return incident of a bed I ordered on the Petco site, which the Petco store was unable to help me with for whatever reason. So instead I went over to Unleashed, where Andrea helped me for at LEAST an hour, trying to figure out how to return it and what the issue was. She sat on the phone for over 20 minutes trying to get a hold of costumer service for me, and, since it was taking so long, let me leave my name and number so she could contact me once she got a hold of them. She was so nice, patient, and so so helpful and supportive. I’ve never had quite the same experience anywhere else, and Unleashed is the only pet store I want to shop at now.</Text>

<text>Good place to get a dog wash. I'm not so sure about buying stuff there, though.  The prices seem high, but, then again, they're high at most other brick and mortar pet stores, too.  Staff are very friendly, though I did run into an issue once where the store was closed at a time when it wasn't supposed to be (short staffed)</text>< GmapID>

Good size pet supply store in a shopping center.
Staff seem both helpful and knowledgeable.
Prices are fair.. Not excessive nor bargaon priced.
Their selection of pet foods and pet toys is extensive, especially in regards to dogs and csts.</Review>

<rating>5< /rating><username>Kaela Davenport</username><Review>This was the best experience I've ever had at a pet supply store. I just adopted my dog about a week ago and she isn't loving the food I already got for her, so i came in to get some wet food to make it more enticing. Asia greeted me immediately and asked me if i needed help, so i told her what i was looking for, she asked what kind of dog i had, mentioned pitties are picky eaters, gassy, sensitive, and often have skin issues, which was everything i was dealing with! She gave me a handful of excellent recommendations, showed me their raw food options, wet food for sensitive tummies, all food had minimal ingredients, no BS fillers, chemicals, dyes, or preservatives, and all for a fair price. Her knowledge was extensive and so helpful. She got me signed up with them so i could utilize all their coupons and best deals. I will be returning to this store, and this store only. Thank you Asia!</Review>< Date>

Good place to get toys and food but not to wash your dog. You have to pick your dog up like 3 feet and put him in a sink and try to wash your dog in this small place.<//Text>

Small pet shop that feels better quality. It's nicer than petco but has a very select group of items. Items include dog, cat, and select bird items but not much else. I would shop here if I really needed but most items are cheaper at target.< /Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Overall, two thumbs and four paws up!

If you like Pet Food Express, or any other store that feels a lot less like a typical Petco/Petsmart-style huge commercial venture, with gigantic stores and staff that knows very little about what they do, then Unleashed by Petco is for you.

Their product selection is a little less comprehensive than a full-blown Petco, and I think Pet Food Express is far better at stocking well-priced, well-thought-out, and great quality apparel-type items (I always get compliments on my dog's raincoat, which is easily the best thing I never even thought existed, before I saw it at PFE, and even has a functional hood).

That being said, these little stores always seem very thoughtfully stocked, and it's hard to leave this one without a couple large armloads of good quality food (especially if you like the high-quality, grain-free, and high-protein varieties), and necessities that larger stores or other small stores simply don't stock.

This particular store is staffed by really friendly people, and if you own a medium or large dog, you can expect to actually find things here for them, like the dreaded doggie diapers you need to assist your older friend, a large variety of high-quality treats, especially long-lasting and/or puzzle types, and a great selection of hygiene products for fur, skin, teeth, and first aid.  They also carry a basic, but well-chosen and comprehensive range of supplements.  Last but hardly least, this tiny location has a tag engraver, and, of course, the tags to go with it.</text></record>

< Review>
This business was decent years a couple of years ago when I started coming. Over the years it has just completely fallen downhill. You'd assume with COVID and all that they would want the business, but the ladies who work here continue to be more lazy, unprofessional, and just rude (especially the Hispanic worker who does the manicures). Instead of setting you an appointment they'll make excuse for you to come on in and see if they're busy. So of course when you do arrive, they have 'no openings,' even though it's completely dead. It's as if they judge you base on your looks and make their decision there. I would no longer be coming to this salon.<//Review>

<text>I brought my mom to get a pedicure and all she asked for was clear. I asked for pink and they gave me a nude clear color. They charged me $60 plus tip. I tell them that I wanted pink. And they tell me it’ll be $10 more. I told them that I already paid over $70. Plus tip. And that for $10 I can just paint my own nails. They keep insisting that it’s going to be $10 and I told them that I just won’t come back again. They didn’t even care. The lady said she would paint my nails with regular polish over the clear if I wanted but that she wouldn’t be taking off the nude polish. I won’t be coming back. They don’t even care about their customers. I’ll take my business elsewhere. I’m really disappointed. I paid Over $70 for something I wasn’t happy with.</text>< Resp>

WORST PLACE IVE EVER BEEN TOO!
I went in asking to get my nails done and the girl was very RUDE.
I got acrylics done , took about 2 hours on my nails they weren’t shaped evenly , the acrylic was over my cuticles and by the 3rd day one of my nails broke .. the $50 dollars that I payed was not worth it.
Very disappointed , do not recommend.< /Text>

<Review>Talk about over priced, how did 25$ nails turn into 55$ left 5 of my fingers bleeding and was so rough. My nails were so sore and didn't do what I asked for . And just started shaping them how she thought looked good . That owner  is a joke and the girl with the pit bull face with all that acne needs to put a smile on her face always stomping around looking mad  . Been there 2 times and the place seems to never have customers . No wonder there never packed.  The girls are ghetto and just sit around eating, watching YouTube or gossiping.  Never will go back here again . Rather go to rose nails.<//Review>< Pictures>

<rating>1</rating><review>When I had a full set put on one of the nail tips was too small for my ring finger and it looked funny for the almost 2 weeks I had them on..just looked like a lousy job that I didn't realize till after I had paid and left. I went in for a fill today and to hopefully get the nail corrected I was told I would have to pay extra to have a new nail put on (even though the man acknowledged it was indeed the wrong size nail tip). I said I wasn't going to pay for the correction and the guy ended up using more acrylic to widen the area where the top should have been. Now my nail looks bulky compared to the rest. I've been in here a few times since moving to Merced 2 years ago and every time I've been in there the atmosphere is not welcoming. I am no longer returning based on their sloppy work and non welcoming attitudes.< /review>< pics>

When this place was new I loved it. In the last few months I have had  bad experiences. Twice the gel had been thinned too much. My nails were chipping within a week. Last time I had Johnny, a little gruff and painted on my cuticle. Not going back.</review>

From my experience...I would never go there again. My nail polish chipped right after I left so I went back to fix it and they wanted to charge me $10 after I just spent $100 and a tip. The only reason they fixed it was because I complained.</Review>

Bad. I made an appointment and showed up on time. Then waited for 20 min. I finally said something so they sat me in a chair. Sat and sat and then asked how long it would be. She said she was busy, and to wait. I was just wondering why they even took appointments, what is the point if they take others before you. I just got up and left. Was upset because I needed my nails done for something, and was unable to get them done.<//review>

<Text>I personally disliked, very much how my nails came out. The woman who did my nails was watching YouTube on her phone the whole entire time, & she didn’t even ask me what shape i wanted. She did her own thing which i disliked. 6 of my nails came out crooked. I would never recommend them to anyone else and i will never go back.<//Text>< username>

The owner is talented but she tried to scam me 2 different times changing prices.she also tried to charge me for length my nails were under an inch SMH she is just about money. I will never go there again she does that to ppl she thinks have money and are dumb. She went from $35 to $45 to $55 one time I went in the and if u tip which I always do my nails would have been $60 SMH all I have to say is act like ur broke when u go in there she is a real live hustler< /text>

<review>Being a little pampered by my Nail Artiste who was booked Nail Time was suggested, Johnny did a decent job, yes he does yank and over drill got 2 cuts at my cuticles but u get what u pay for 30. for white tips and 5. for 2fingers art, he had my nails completed from start to finish in approx 35min..yes he was rude when my husband asked what color babe he proceeded to answer for me ' NO color! u should just get plain acrylic (which was 10. more, don't understand that one?!)  So I just went with it knowing I have a Real Artiste to go back to. 👸< /review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

My cuticles were murdered and cut too deep, but didn't even scrub my feet. Had to ask for base coat because she was about to slap on the color with out it.

<Review>The woman said she would get my nails done in an hour because I was in a rush to go somewhere but she did a horrible job... she cut my cuticles and I was bleeding, my nails looked like bubbles on my nails (my nails were so heavy, they were sore after) and when I went to Professionails in Atwater, they even asked why I paid for these nails and actually showed me what acrylic nails are supposed to look like. Never again will I go to this place.. this is just my experience.</Review>< pics>

Worst customer service you can ever get. They will slap on insurance and other items to your plan without even asking you. They ask for your pin something they shouldn’t do. I would never recommend this store to anyone< /Text>

This is a fake. It shows the picture of the other store but the number of crooked cricket. Cricket off the 65 is so bad. They steal your money charging extra for everything. They lie and say there is no 4 for 100 plan just so you can get on 4 for 130. They will never have my business ever again. The other cricket on Honolulu is so much better. Makes you feel comfortable and best customer service.< /review>

I went so I could try one of the new chicken sandwiches, and so I could get a shamrock shake before they're gone. I got the spicy chicken sandwich, and it was actually pretty good. I was also happy that I received my order as it was placed, and wasn't missing any items.</text>

Super slow I was in drive through line at last window for at least 10 minutes waiting for my food and before that another 10 just waiting in a pretty long line I feel everytime I go I’m always waiting is go to a different one but this is closest to me and on base also as I was sitting there an employee was just sitting there on her phone.. I would give only 1 star but they actually got my order right<//review>

Horrible service and management of a facility. Walked in, stood there ten minutes not one person acknowledged we were even there. Several disgruntled people waiting for food inside, drive through seemed to be a better option.<//Review>

<Text>Why can you upgrade a meal drink to a McFlurry on the app and not in the drive through? Out of sprite and gave me unsweetened tea instead of sweet tea. Not that big of a deal however.

Long line, very SLOW, must be an issue with ordering because employee must not have been able to hear or understand SIMPLE order  had to repeat it about 4 times, pick up window slow, attendant at pay window seemed to be hurried and impatient,      Food was OK.  NO SALAD AVAILABLE.  McDonalds need to have salads all the time since this is the only McDonalds at main gate area.< /Text>

Like always, this is the weaker of the two McDonald's on Camp Pendleton. They did not have the needed requirements for a strawberry or chocolate shake, but the machine was working for once. Very long drive thru line, and when I went to the first window to pay, no one was there... after over 5 minutes or more of waiting, I pulled up to the second window because the cars in front of me had left. They were confused no one was at the first window and even more so that I finally pulled up to the second window. They were polite.<//Text>

The customer service here is beyond me. The manager should consider correcting their employees or they will lose business. The fries also have no salt.<//text><date>1611014514829</date>< name>

If I could give negative stars, I would. This location is abhorrent. I have never spent less than 30 minutes in this drive thru line, whether there is 1 car ahead of me or 4-5. Food is ALWAYS COLD! How does this happen? For all the time it takes me to make it up to the pickup window, shouldn’t my food be freshly made? Tonight I spent 1.5 hours in line STUCK! I couldn’t even drive away after waiting 45 minutes because I was stuck in line between cars. I called from the drive thru line to speak with the a manager and they hung up on me... I am so upset with this experience...</text>

Drove thru, they ignored us while sitting in the lobby while on their phones. Checked the site for the time lobby and drive thru closed and I called and they completely lied and said they were closed way before the listed times for their exact store. Obviously management is failing to do their jobs. I’ll  be passing this information to management, other customers and possibly corporate.<//Review>

It says 1200 drive through at 1129 and they answered us instantly in the drive through but told us they were closed...don't understand why they would be closed 30 minutes early but still be able to answer us instantly in the drive through.... adjust the hours online or do your job...< /text>

<review>Nice place, decent food. The French fries aren't always hot/warm and crisp, drive through is very slow always long lines and slow moving. Partly due to people making large orders since dinning room is limited (thanks Covid) and other part seems like a skeleton crew is working, basically un prepared for high traffic.
My rating will be better if COVID restrictions are eliminated and or drive through time is improved. Sitting 15mins 4/5 cars back from order kiosk is crazy. Could have went inside and ordered. But where are the signs saying order inside is available?
Maybe you will have better luck than me.
Look forward to a better experience next time.<//review><rating>3< /rating><user_name>Brandon Sheffield< /user_name><pics>None< /pics><userid>115632658109829782359<//userid>< resp>

I don’t accept the way they treat customers and there food if you ask for fresh it’s the compilers opposite they’ll just toss any old food that didn’t get giving away and sever it they the employees choose to laugh and joke instead of doing work , attitudes if u ask them to do something kindly. I went there and I asked for 2 Fresh Filets and 1 Fresh Large Fries because usually when I go there the stuff is cold so I asked for fresh this time but they still continue to do a poor job</Review>

<text>Horrible service this morning. The person had an attitude, dragging himself around. I usually come every other morning for the sausage McMuffin combo w/o egg. Same thing every morning, all of a sudden the price goes from less than $5 for the combo to $7.75. I didn’t even get ice in my drink!  This is definitely that sign that I need to stop eating at McDonalds.......

I don’t see the franchisees responding to any of their valuable feedback, what a great way add further damage to the Branding of McDonads Camp Pendleton when you don monitor your own reviews/complaints for further action.

I’ve also felt like the military community gets the shaft so many times when it comes to being offered Great Customer service because it’s “on base”. This final experience solidified the struggle.... This entire resteraunt needs to be placed on a “Performance Improvement Plan”</text>< Pictures>

This on base McDonalds has jumped the shark, for bad service, and bad food.
I've tried to go here to this one three times in the past week, and it takes more than 25 mins to get through the drive thru...
AND...they can't get an order right.
I give up. We won't be back.<//Text>

The place was dirty, 95% of the staff looked unhappy and tire. They are understaffed. Staff don't have patience for costumers. The floor was sticky and dirty like soda was spilled and was not clean properly. There was food on the floor at the other side of the counter where staff were preparing the orders. Our sandwiches were not prepared like in other McDonalds, the big mac was inundated with the spread that the bread for soggy. My friend's sandwich had her meat burnt. The French fries for both of us were not fresh, the ones that they gave us had been sitting out under the light. Did I mention that the place was dirty? I'm surprise that they are serving in a military base in those conditions.<//Review>

Wait was long, ran out of cherry pies, no ice cream ready yet. Not sure what's going on at this location. Customer Service needs help. Remember you are serving Service Members they should get the best service you can give. Our Service members sacrifice a lot to protect this country. At the very least we can do is have a hot meal and the best service we can give. Thank You to all the Service members.</review>

Good luck if you try ordering food here and definitely check your order before you leave. It’s one thing if it happens every so often, but EVERY trip? Get it together.< /Text>< Pictures>

Don't normally eat McDonald's, but it was okay; however, $2.50 for sm fry, and $5 for a really small Filet-o-fish seemed high.< /text>

<text>We went through D. Thru at 6:10PM on 6/11/20 according to the receipt and the line seemed to move normal for a McDonalds at 6pm but one thing I noticed was the general respectful employees that we spoke to. Only two employees but both thanked us & made sure we were taken care of. That is not what we’re used to from young people behind the counters or Drive thru window.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>This restaurant does not communicate with the mobile ordering app. On two separate occasions I ordered from the mobile app for pickup, but when I got there some of the items I ordered were out of stock.  Also the drive thru service is painfully slow. About a month ago I spent 45 minutes waiting in line. Most of the time it’s upward of a 15 minute wait. About 50% of the time the workers are not very polite either.<//text><resp>None</resp><Date>1585942738437<//Date>< pics>

There's usually a long wait, they are often out of everything and sometimes the food is a bit cold. BUT they are absolutely the hardest working staff I've ever seen. They have so many military customers, so I understand the long waits, food shortages and cold food at times. They work so hard and they are very friendly, even on their busiest days!<//Text>

Something in the order is always messed up from not giving all of the food we ordered to being charged the wrong price. Its hit or miss if the person you talk to about the problems will give attitude or not. The giant bug on my hashbrown was it for me. Clearly they do not care. Please if you want McDonalds drive the extra 4 mins to oceanside Blvd. I Would give 0 stars if possible.</Review>

<review>We order breakfast sandwiches and then charged us for it but gave us a completely different McMuffin. The lady serving us wasn’t very welcoming either. She didn’t smile nor sounded happy. They quality of there egg was horrible. My two daughters and I all got sick after consuming. My eldest, who was the only one that didn’t have egg, didn’t get sick. They had disgusting bathrooms and the workers were very rude. Never going there again!!!< /review><Response>None</Response><user_name>Audrey Strojan</user_name></record>

Probably one of the worst McDonald's I've been to. They're always slow, orders are usually incorrect, and their soda machine never has the correct mixtures. The service is good, aside from that, this McDonald's is horrible.<//Text>

This McDonalds hardly ever refills their soda machine. Almost every time I've gone, their drinks are either too carbonated with no syrup or have too much syrup with little carbonation. Not to mention the sweet tea is non existent. I've been given unsweet every time and have had to change it out for the watered down Dr. Pepper.<//Text>

This Google entry for hours lists them as “OPEN” currently.
Went through the drive thru, not open. Opens at 0500.
Went inside, not open. Opens at 0500.
The doors and windows reflect the correct times, however it needs to be updated across ALL platforms as people plan their trips and stops according to data received off of Google Maps.</review>

Terrible! It took 45 minutes in drive-thru at 8pm at night and there was no way to get out of line and go inside. We waited so long both of my kids fell asleep waiting for there dinner. They also got my order wrong for the kids meal and gave me chicken instead of a cheeseburger after waiting for forever. It would of been faster if I would of gone off base...I know better for next time.</Review>

Order is usually wrong but because they are the closest McDonald’s without driving across base, it’s usually packed and they have slow service and half the time you get old warm food. I haven’t heard many good things about this McDonald’s...</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><date>1561247757744< /date><Review>The cashier gave me a number card to place on my table and told me someone would bring my food to me since I’m dining in. A worker walked by with a bag of food and asked me what I ordered. After I told her, she said this isn’t my order. I sat at my table waiting for 10 minutes and wondered how much longer it will take so I went up to the front counter to ask. Turns out the bag that worker was walking around with was my food and she left it on counter so it has been sitting there the whole time. What’s the point of giving me a random number? It’s better to call out the number on my receipt and have me get up to pick it up myself. My food was cold by the time I got to it.< /Review>< Name>

On Sunday around 4:45 PM.  There were only like 8 people eating. The place was a mess, food on the floor and no clean tables were available. We had to clean our own table. Our frys were old and cold.<//Text>

I have never been inside but the drive thru is terrible. Long line or no line, it takes over 20 minutes from the speaker to the second window. Once you get to the second window, it's another 10 minutes. Workers goof off and use awful language with the window open. I'm all about making work fun, but the workers' behaviour was very distasteful and crude. If I had a child in the back, I would have been even more upset. Also, at the second window, I don't want to hear workers talking about their "protien farts" as I'm waiting 20 to get my food. There needs to be a staff evaluation of this establishment. I've never seen a fast food joint as disorganized and pitiful as this one.</Text>

Besides being slow and some times taking 15mins or more to receive my food on different  occasions, it's not a bad McDonalds to go to. My food is always correct and the employees care. Not only that but the mcdonalds is clean and well taken care of. Gives a friendly family oriented feel.</Text>

This place is garbage. Workers couldn't even get a simple pain cheeseburger correct. Then give attitude when you take back what they messed up. They should put in a chick-fil-a in its place!!! Sign the petition<//text>

The wait for less than 5 cars at the drive through is consistently greater than 15 minutes. Staff was rude on at least one occasion, and their prices are $1-2 higher per meal higher than right off base. Go to Panera.</review>

McDonald's claim to fame is their mechanized precision and speed....this place has neither. Don't bother using the mobile app either because it doesn't decrease your wait at all. This base needs Chick-fil-A.< /Text>

<text>30 min for 2 happy meals is ridiculous.... to add they forgot everything but the nuggets and toy 🤦🏽‍♀️. When we pulled up to the window it looked like everyone was standing around. Whoever the manager is needs to either retrain their employees it clean house and get employees who actually do their jobs.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80dc6528f7daf6e5:0x8fc0fc944470be65< /gmapID></record>

Absolute worst Mcdonalds anyone could ever go to. It’s been over a year in the making of just constant messing.up ever single order. Asked for bacon Big Mac and got no bacon. Asked for a double quarter pounder with cheese and got a quarter pounder without cheese. The food is never hot it is at most room temp.  The service is terrible. Only thing good about is when i have been in there it was clean.  I created an account just to do this review if that tells you something</Text>

Had a rough experience here.  The manager was running register and they seemed short staff.  The food took about avg time, but the nuggets were burnt.  They refunded the guy in from of me.  They also forgot to make my 3rd kids meal.  This place was well kept and clean, but I feel they are way understaffed and super busy all the time.< /Text>

Honestly I come here out of convenience of location but by far they have the worst customer service. Today alone bc the lady taking orders was giggling every 3 seconds she kept asking “what” after everything I ordered & after a long day of work I go to the drive thru for it to be fast HENCE FAST FOOD. I get it’s McDonald’s I shouldn’t expect chick fil a customer service but damn dude the least y’all could do is put your listening ears on when the customer is trying to order bc we can hear you giggling when you don’t turn the mic off AND DONT GET ME STARRED ON HOW I ALWAYS GET RAW UNSALTED POTATO SLICES YOU CALL FRIES.< /Review>

<review>Absolutely the worst McDonald’s... Floor is flooded from the bathroom seems like no one knows what is going on and the manager is standing there watching all of this go on.. Almost 20 mins to get my order and still gave me the wrong sandwich!! WE NEED TO ICE THEM!! That’s the only way this issue will be resolved... 22 area is no better!!</review>< Rating>

It's your average McDonald's. Nothing special but be prepared to wait anywhere from 20-60 minutes. Service is okay but if anything you should definitely go to a different McDonalds</text>

When my husband drove all the way back to get it remade, she gave him a huge amount of attitude and told him she "needed to see the sandwich". Obviously my husband got pissed and just demanded a refund. She said "oh my God, fine". Dont come here if you want sass from people who cant make simple sandwiches.< /Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>MatChe< /user_name><pics>None<//pics><text>This is the worst McDonald's I have ever had the misfortune of going to. They are CONSTANTLY out on so many things - burger patties, chicken tenders, ice cream machine is always out. The staff are very poorly trained. You could be standing at the register for a good 10-15 minutes and everyone who walks by will act like they don't see you waiting there to have your order taken. Drive-through always has ridiculously long lines. They are incapable of making custom orders so good luck trying to order something that deviates from what is written on the menu. Everybody moves sooooo slooooow that everything takes forever. It's faster to just drive to a place off-base. Save yourself the headache.< /text><rate>1</rate>< time>

McDonald's is a great place to take the kids out of the house to get a pic of your favorite food for your family and your friends will help me find the recipe to make you feel more relaxed in your room with the investigation of a few people in your life music for a couple guys who have a bd125-15 in a day or a half hour and then you get off</text>

You might as well go 5 miles out to another McDonalds, and you would still be home to eat your food before this place serves you.  I used the app and waited for 40 mins,  only to find out they forgot about my order, other times it’s been sorry we’re out of this or that, and they always seem to forget something on your order.
I’ve been pretty much everywhere, and I have a hard time finding a worst McDonald then the one on Camp Pendleton.  In the words of my 4 year old son, dad!!!! They’re Bad, bad, bad!!!</text>

<Text>Don't even deserve one star. Going through the drive through, it took  20 minutes between the time we placed our order, and the time we got to the pick up window. Car in front of us sat at pay-window more than 5 minutes before someone took their money. And then waited at the pick-up window more than 10 minutes for their one bag of food! Unacceptable!
Asked to speak to manager, to let him know that it took us 20 min to get our food, and to find out, why those customers had not been asked to park while waiting, so the line could keep moving.
To that he answered, that he was only there to stock, and that he didn't know.
Never heard of a manager who "stocked", instead of making sure his store ran smoothly!
On top of that we were short one sandwich, and didn't get any straws for our drinks.</Text><Date>1530772728834</Date><GmapID>0x80dc6528f7daf6e5:0x8fc0fc944470be65<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The servers, superb. Management, however, very disrespectful and careless. The cashiers were very polite and patient. One of the individuals in charge (basing this off of their white uniform whereas the other workers wore black) literally dropped my meal on the counter in front of me. I looked up at her, said thank you yet she continued to walk away. I said it louder to the point that everyone turned towards me so I know she heard. The other individual wearing the same white uniform pointed and me and they both looked at me, looked at each other, and laughed and danced around like they owned the place. Immediately after her short jig, the first lady in white started snapping, pointing, and demanding in a condescending tone to the worker at the fry pit to "Get to work" and then turned to her counterpart and complained how lazy "the workers are these days" openly in front of everyone. Extremely disrespectful. Very poor image of the establishment to convey to the public.< /Review>< response>

The worst Mcdonalds i have ever been to. Dont bother they will mess up your order every time, whether there is traffic of orders or not. I feel really bad for the managers because you can tell they try hard and will make up for the others mistake.but the fact that the rest of the employee keeps messing up and playing on their phone, once taking selfies at the drive thru window!
Not just that they dont even have they're stuff up to date , all the other mcdonalds just a couple miles away have the berry sprite on the digital ordering menu in the drive thru, while the one on base has to put in a lemonaid. Half the time they give you a lemonaid because of lack of communication.
I hope someone fixes this place.< /text>

<Review>Horrible customer service. Night shift is the worst. They lack on so much from customer service to uniforms. They often dont wear uniforms. These girls dont want people coming in at night. They turn away too many people saying cash only, no product availability, they dont even want to sell soft drinks. There is a 20 to 35 minute wait for drive thru, when only two vehicles on line. Fries are raw and food takes forever because they dont want you back during their shift. I'm not sure if theres two supervisors or just Nicole Cummings but should not be left along to run the store.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80dc6528f7daf6e5:0x8fc0fc944470be65< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

THE SLOWEST MCDONALDS EVER! Doesn't matter if you order ahead, go inside, or drive through, you will be waiting between 30-60 minutes. Once you get your food, it wont be correct and it will be cold. Just take the time to drive off base or go somewhere else. This place isn't worth the headache.< /Text>

Always check your order before you leave this one, and some of the employees get attitude with customers here too. One got mad at me for asking if my number had been called, rolled her eyes as she gave me my food, then angrily threw my ranch in the bag because she didn't like me asking for ranch either I guess.</text>

With only two orders at the counter.  We should not have to wait 15 for a sing order of fries.  We gave up and got a refund and no fries.  The family that was ahead of us waited longer, only to have to return because the order was missing food.<//Text>

If you’re in a hurry and there’s more than two cars in the drive through, go somewhere else. They are generally slow and occasionally get your order wrong.<//text>

Came to the drive through at 8:38pm didn't leave drive through until 9:00. Saw the cashier (Daniel) just chilling at the window talking to his friends in the car at the pick up window. Waste of time.</text>

<Review>Took thirty minutes to get two mcflurries at eight at night. Slow service. Drive through seems confused most of the time. Literally in line right now in a single lane drive through and they lost track of our order. And when the order doesn't take 30 minutes it's usually wrong anyway. Probably the worst McDonald's I've been to.<//Review><Rate>1<//Rate>< Name>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>This is by far the worst McDonalds I've ever visited.  The order is never right.  What is the most disappointing though is the employee's lack of willingness to make it right or act like they care.  I was placed in the reserved drive thru because my food wasn't done.  That was fine.  When they brought my food I told her I was never given straws.  She said she'd bring some out.  She never did.  I called the store and asked for some.  Nobody ever came out.  I eventually left with nothing to drink my soda with.  Is this an isolated incident? No.  The employees lack insight into how to perform their jobs at just a baseline level.  It's too much work for them.  Plus, my orders are wrong more than they are right.  I'd be hard pressed to find a worse McDonalds.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

This McDonald's always messes up my order whenever I go through the drive thru. EVERY SINGLE TIME I go drive thru there's always something missing. I don't get it. How hard is it for the employees to simply remember a small order.</Text>

<review>We finished swimming at the beach and wanted a snack to hold us before dinner. We decided this McD's. The line was long on drive thru but the wait sure wasn't. This place ran like a well oiled machine. Very proficient at getting our order w a nice voice and getting our order thru at the window. Good job guys.<//review><username>Shannon Thome<//username>< date>

<text>Becareful they over charge for things alot so really have them repeat your order and do your own math before payment. I understand its mainly teens and they need the experience but they need to do things right, also, last I went all orders of drinks and dressings were wrong. So make sure you check once you get your food. McDonald's is McDonald's it's just the people working the service wrong.<//text></record>

Staff is great but the excessive wait time is mind boggling. Rating due to long line and long wait inside as well. Expect 20 mins or more for your order.< /review>

Has become expected for them to mess up orders. Last thing I ordered the only thing they got right was the bun. Ice cream machine breaks so often even after corporate came in and replaced it, they have to be doing something wrong. Manager is rude as well.< /Review>
