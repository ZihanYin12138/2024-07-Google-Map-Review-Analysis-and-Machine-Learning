Close enough where we can walk, because parking anywhere in Hollywood is insane! The prices were relatively fair, especially for being in Hollywood. The meat was good. I’ve definitely had better Kbbq in K-town but this is a good quick fix place. Sesame oil provided on the table tasted watered down. The sides are good, so happy they have rice noodle paper provided with their sides! Their sesame salad is actually really good, tasty dressing. Service was good, it wasn’t busy, they continuously check on you, super nice people.<//Text>

I did not like this place, the second time I will not go back! a portion of meat is small, with an overestimate price. Expect more from this place ... At first it was nice, fun, but then I noticed the hood, it was very dirty. The hood is directly above the table .In the end I put 2 stars, for dirt and a high price. I do not understand why they put high scores in this place ???!!!<//text>

the price is acceptable , the quality of the meat specifically the chicken is not okay, the time between refilling the meat needs to be improved it is not okay to wait so long to get more food. I hope this  review doesn't hurt in any way the business but instead helps to improve.
I look forward to give this restaurant one  more chance< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2bf4615609e67:0xfd93e0f91dc54608< /gmap_id></record>

<text>This place is amazing. The food is so good. Its all that needs to be said...and if some Texan gave it 1 star well...they should go back to Texas cos I bet nothing outside of Texas meets their Texan "standard" plus anyone who is a BBQ fan knows that each part of the country has its own take...this is a delicious, local, AA establishment where the food is made with love and on Sunday.. a soundtrack of gospel and soul.< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

This place is amazing! I love korean bbq as it is, but was pleasantly surprised by the vegetarian options offered here. I'm not actually a vegetarian but I ended up sitting with the vegetarians in our group and I can honestly say I enjoyed all of the food that was served. I'm sure the meat is delicious too, considering the flavor of the vegetarian meat. Give this place a shot if you are nearby. Also try the strawberry soju wine stuff... it tastes like candy but its strong ;)<//Review>

This was so authentic and delicious! From the korean music videos ambience to the way the food was served. As a Korean American living in sf, the authentic korean food options are def limited, this really made my day! Tim was especially nice and nomi was great with suggestions. I'll def be back!</Review>

<Text>Used UberEats to order and for $8 per big bowl of spicy pork, it's a steal.  Food arrived in 20 minutes still fresh and warm.  Delicious and can order optional banchan.  I got mine with kimchi fried rice but you can choose brown rice, egg fried rice, white rice or greens.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmap_id>

The first Korean BBQ with true vegan options! You can tell that the vegan meats are marinated and full of flavor. Very friendly and attentive staff, we had the grill full at all times and the staff was proactive to bring next items as we were cooking.<//text>

<Review>I was a little worried at first.  We couldn't find parking and it looked closed.  But we made it!
Fast service,  friendly staff,  and the food is the best K BBQ I've had yet!
Adding to my review...
After a second visit,  I like this place even more! It's a different experience.  It's family owned.  Not by a bunch of quiet Koreans,  but a fun Chicano/Latino family.  The decor is artsy,  the music 80's. The menu is set up a little different and after reading these cry baby reviews,  I can answer their complaints.
The least expensive plate is $12.99 and it's all you can eat. The meat flavors are limited on that meal,  but its all you can eat.
We ordered the $18.99 plate. It came with everything you get at those loud Asian run places.  We shared everything.  And it was all you can eat.  It taste just as good,  if not better,  than any Korean run restaurant.

People are just not used to seeing Chicanos serving K food.  Get over it! Enjoy!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Straight up my favorite kbbq! This place is a great compromise for my boyfriend and me because I'm vegan and he wants Korean barbecue all the time. There's only two vegan meats but that is a lot more than I can ask for! I thoroughly enjoyed the chickenless chicken because it barbecued well. The marinated veggies were very good and I loved the side dishes! $20 for the vegan barbecue is pretty good to me because vegan meats are usually pretty pricey. Overall, I enjoyed my visit and my boyfriend enjoyed the regular meats.</Text>

75 minute wait for party of two with only two parties ahead of us. Waitress was surly with us throughout the meal after we requested an update on our original quoted 15-minute wait time. Food was just okay, restaurant was clean.<//review>

This is my favorite place when I come to LA. All the meats are so tastey, especially the spicy pork. The service is always great. All the sides are delicious too, it's a great price for the quality and the fact that it's all you can eat. Love the interior too, it's fun and different!<//Text>

<Text>The food is great, the price is reasonable, and it's all you can eat. What more could one ask for?

After going to another K-BBQ place before finding this one, I really appreciate the all you can eat and reasonable prices. Not to mention it is conveniently located for me at least.< /Text><user>115040951780093585069<//user><Time>1469351425330</Time><Name>Thomas Hinkle< /Name><pictures>None< /pictures><Gmap_id>0x80c2bf4615609e67:0xfd93e0f91dc54608</Gmap_id>< Response>

The food was okay, the tables were a bit crowded.  Excellent staff, beautiful artwork.  Not much of a selection on the menu, decent prices. I eat a lot of Korean bbq and this just doesnt cut it.< /Review>

<Text>Great AYCE Korean BBQ. Although AYCE options are limited, it was a perfect mix of meats.  The meat grill didn't cook evenly, so you definitely need patience while cooking your meat.  Also, any meat that is not eaten if over in excess will be charged at the end of the meal.  Make sure you dont tale more than you can handle. :-)</Text><Date>1553533906322</Date>< resp>

<Review>Squandered opportunity. Being one of the only kbbq places in Hollywood there is no reason why this place should not have a 2 hour wait on a Saturday night. It all starts with the menu. The cheapest ayce option comes with 2 meats, why even bother putting that on the menu. The banchan selection is very small maybe 4-5 items rice being one of the options. Salad only comes with more expensive ayce options. Next is the sauces. There is some oil and some kind of spicy mayo type sauce on the table, but really doesn't serve the right purpose. Service is also a little slow. Meat wasn't the greatest but not the worst.

I had high hopes, but unfortunately those hopes were shattered.</Review>< Pictures>

According to our friends who brought us here, this place is never packed. However, it was pretty packed when we got there. The food is good but they don't change the grill so by the end we had a super smoking grill. Service was ok....<//review>

<text>Cute name. Cute decor. Pass on everything else. Not like typical KBBQ, can't order a plate of meat and share.

The flavor of the meats in this place is very good! It's KBBQ style place, but fusion style. Very nice staff and excellent ventilation. You don't walk out smelling like a bbq yourself.  Pricing is also quite reasonable,  starting at $12.99. Great place for bbq meat without the crowds and smoke of ktown kbbq places.< /Text>

The restaraunt is owned by one awful manager named GEORGE who doesnt know the slightest clue when it comes to running a kkbq. Not to mention he treats the employees like crap for the majority of the time. Plenty of better and cheaper koreanbbq places to eat. If not Tommy's is next door.</Review>

Great supplier. Often, we run into those special motors that no other supplier has, so we come here to get them. Service is always fast, and these guys know their stuff.< /review>

Absolutely awesome. I went in to buy a new capacitor, the lady behind the desk checked my capacitor and found out that it was still good. She gave me some pointers to fix my motor. I will try to fix it myself but if not I will definitely be bringing my motor back to AAA electric motors for repair.</review>

Fast, efficient, knowledgeable, professional sales staff. This place is a clean, well organized electric motor distributor.  Another electric motor repair shop in Long Beach recommended AAA to me.  I can see why.< /review>

<review>Valentina and her team are the best! We will be forever grateful for all the hard work they have put in to making sure we got our forever home. They are very informative, always communicating with us, and just making sure everything looks well for us. Being a first time buyer, we were worried that we would be screwed over because we don't know what to do, but Valentina and her team made sure we understood every single detail of what our loan entailed. They really looked out for us! Highly recommend Valentina and her team.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>{'time': 1628726817950, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words.'}< /Response>< gmapID>

Valentina is amazing at what she does! She is extremely experienced at closing loans. Valentina has closed multiple loans for me. If you are looking for a lending who closes on time every time Valentina is the best choice!<//text>

Valentina Estes and Benchmark team are amazing. Valentina was always there for me when I had questions. I remember calling her at any time and she was always there to answer all my questions. She also cares for all her clients. She made my home buying experience stress free and always had answers for my questions. She is very knowledge able and treats her clients like family.   I was able to purchase my home with her help and also the Benchmark Team. I am truly blessed to have worked with Valentina and her team. Thank you and I aporeciate all your  help.</Review>

Everything was handled online and only had to go sign the closing. If you are looking to refinance or a loan to buy Benchmark should be your choice!!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

<Review>Valentina Estes at Benchmark Mortgage was a great listener and very knowledgeable in the industry. Which made it that much more easier to trust her since day one. My husband and I loved the treatment we got as a Veteran family at Benchmark ( by the way the office is gorgeous). Most people might get intimidated by not knowing enough about the mortgage industry let alone seeing  big numbers as a potential mortgage payment, but Valentina was always very nice by helping us understand and break everything down for us to better understand our individual scenario. Valentina is always a phone call away. My husband and I were very pleased to see that Valentina and her crew had profound respect to our Veterans of our community. Thank you- The Valadez Family</Review>< Pictures>

No doubt about it Valentina is great. If you are looking for a local lender make sure she is on the top of your list. Her years of experience really show. I’ve had the pleasure of closing a few transactions with her and never came across any delays or issues. We closed on time or before the set closing date which is a plus for our buyers and sellers. I definitely recommend Valentina and her staff they are all amazing!</Review>

She’s extremely smart and professional and very fast. She explained everything very patiently throughly and with a fabulous attitude. If something came up such as my seller was a Canadian citizen and paperwork may have been delayed because of the virus/ Canada closing , she said don’t worry and she contacted escrow and people. She went over and above her job description.  She’s a great problem solver and is geniouly interesting in helping people. Well, she made my loan happen -ahead of schedule. Valentina beautiful name beautiful person.  Definitely Call her you’ll see! She’s a dynamo!!

I would like share that Valentina will definitely get you the best deal for you!  Valentina works hard for the best interest for her clients and not what works best for her.  Valentina went above and beyond through our financing process, always on call at any time just to make sure the process was going right.  I definitely recommend her if you would like someone to trust and know that she will be helping you out because she cares for you!< /Text>

I had a great experience working with Valentina Estes and her team at Benchmark Mortgage.  I would recommend anyone who is looking to purchase a house to go with Valentina.  This is my second house I purchase with Valentina and on both occasions she worked with me to get the best deal possible. Valentina was very professional, knowledgeable and very helpful. Thank you!!</Text>

Highly recommended! Valentina helped me with my loan. This is my 3rd home  I’ve purchased in my lifetime. When I decided to sell my previous home and purchase a new one, I hesitated on choosing a loan officer. I told myself, who do I want to be chasing in this frustrating process. After I decided to go with Valentina from Benchmark I quickly began to feel relaxed and sure I made the right choice. She was professional, knowledgeable and genuine. She always spoke with the truth and was real with the numbers. Valentina answered all my calls ( I made a lot of calls) except for one but texted me and called me right back . I highly recommend Valentina! Thank you so much for making the process pleasant and always keeping it real. Thank you!!</text>

My experience with Valentina was outstanding. She worked with me every step of the way to get our credit where it needed to be, to finding the home to suit our needs, and the right loan for our budget. She went above and beyond her job title. She is very personable to work with and talk to. I highly recommend her to anyone looking for a home loan.</Text>

I had a great experience with Valentina. Since, day one she answered my phone call right away and scheduled me an appointment the next morning. I was in a dilemma were another lender prequalify for an incorrect amount. Valentina helped me, and told me the truth about the amount that I can be prequalify. Valentina is honest, efficient, professional, and dedicated. All her staff, are very helpful and willing to help clients above and beyond. Yesterday, I got the keys to my home and it was in less than 25days. I highly recommend Valentina, don’t waste your time in another place.< /review>

As a first time homebuyer, it was a very great experience to have met Valentina!! She is very professional and knows her job very well. She always carries a smile on her face and treats you very well. I never thought my dream would come true and she made this happen for us. Me and my family are very grateful towards her and appreciate everything she did to get us here as homebuyers. She explains everything to the fullest and doesnt get tired of my twenty one questions everyday. She was always very busy but she always called you back for any questions you had. I am very proud to have chose her as my loan agent!! She is someone important that I will never forget because she was always there for us & if we did not understand something she would help us right away. I would highly recommend her to anyone interested in buying a home!! Don't hesitate to choose her as your agent, believe me you wont regret it! She goes all the way out until she finds a solution for you. She is a person with a great personality, good communication skills,and works great with others. Thank you Valentina for all you have done to fulfill my dream!! I wanted to thank your assistant Elena Saldana also for her great big help and putting up with my nonstop calls! Thanks for everything Elena!! I could'nt of done it without you guys!! Elena is also very helpful and has a great personality and ready to help assist you.
Sorry for my essay story but you are truly recommended!!< /review>

The first day we came in on benchmark for pre approval we were nervous and confused, but with the warm welcome and help of all staff and specially Valentina everything went smooth. She is a very kind person that would respond to all sorts questions asked. I recommend to any one who want to buy a property. I'm glad we  ended up in benchmark. Thank you Valentina for your Time and all staff members.

I saw that you helped a lady with her mortgage......That's my beautiful friend.... she is more than a mortgage lender. She is a vessel of God reaching out to people in need. Helping out in the areas of her abilities and talents that God gave her. I am proud of you Valentina.

2 years ago:
My experience with Benchmark mortgage in  Imperial County was exceptionally great. I did not have to worry or stress about anything because everything was taken care of by the rep Valentina Estes, who is very friendly, helpful as well as educative about the loan process. She was able to advise me on how to move forward with my finances so that I can qualify for a loan. I didn't think buying a house would be easy but she made it feel like it was. I like working with honest people..... and the big plus was that I gained a true friend druing this process. Way to go Valentina!

That my beautiful friend.... she is more than a mortgage lender. She a vesel of God reaching out to people in need. Helping out in the areas of her abilities and talents that God gave her. I am proud of you Valentina</Text>

I am so thankfull and glad I had the chance to get my loan through Valentina. From the first time I went I knew she had the experience and the honesty to help me, she was loyal and got rid of all the doubts I had. If you have had bad experiences in the past and don’t know who to trust, valentina is the home loaner for you.<//Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) We are infinitely grateful for all the attention received for the purchase of our house, since they made the whole process easy and very pleasant.
All procedures were quick, with a personalized, friendly service, giving us timely advice.
After some unpleasant experiences with other companies, Valentina helped us professionally, quickly, without setbacks and with a warmth that made us feel part of her family.
Fully recommended!

Update .... thanks again for all the support to refinance our house a few days ago, with lower interest and less time .... thanks!

Coffee was decent but due to covid-19 it's a little difficult to read the menu and know what you want without making other people wait for you. Wish they posted a menu outside the line.</text>

<text>There are few things I look for in a good shop - hospitality (being customer and neighborhood focused) and serving delicious coffee. This place nails both. Steve was great guiding me through the options available. I had a very good pour over (V60) and Kombucha (strawberry lemonade) from a local spot. Well worth the visit.< /text>< Rate>

Friendly staff (shout out to Cristiana & Steve) and best pour over in town. Chill environment with good music and good vibes. Single origin beans excellent for take-home but my pour overs never turn out as good as Steve's!</Text>

Chill coffee shop that shares a space with a flower shop.

Agreeable staff that wants to please and will make what you ask even if it's off menu.

Went to California for a weekend trip and was in dire need of caffeine. Ordered an iced mocha and it was delicious. The only minor complaint is that I wish there was more ice in the coffee.</review>

This place is great if you like quality coffee. The shop owner Robert is very knowledgable about coffee and makes very good french press or pour over cup of joe. Highly recommend.</review>

The Coffee Method has some of the best coffee in San Diego. If you want a quality cup of coffee or coffee-drink, come here and you will not be disappointed.

No frills, no strawberry mochacinnos, no dollar menu specials. The comparative drawbacks of this place are those of choosing fresh squeezed orange juice over orange soda: it often takes longer to make and is more expensive.

Another thing is that they are super clean and meticulous about everything: weighing exact amount of beans for each pour over, sampling every batch of ice coffee, and washing every piece of equipment with almost OCD-like frequency. The guy who owns the place might not greet you with a smile or actively listen to your complaining about the weather, but he will make sure your coffee is good.<//review>

Really awesome chai tea lattes! I like them with zip and that's how they serve them. The atmosphere is pretty basic. They have Wi-Fi if you need it. Fun and friendly baristas. Prices are competitive.<//text>

<text>The coffee was ok but the service put me off.  When I asked for clarification on prices on the product I was mocked by the barista who offered to charge me more if I liked.   It was apparently funny on his end, but it's not funny for the customer and made me feel uneasy.  I wouldn't care to go back for that.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Robert offers quality coffee!  If you're a Starbucks or instant coffee drinker you won't appreciate or even recognize quality coffee and brewing techniques that Robert offers! Robert knows his coffee and how to grind and extract the beans properly down to the right water temp for french press and espresso extractions!  So I don't know what the gripe is from these people giving him a bad review.

My husband and I saw this place on our way to Sunset Cliffs to watch the sunset from Hodad's and I wanted a latte before going there.  We ended up chatting it up (enjoying my latte miel and my husband had a french press with the quality ethiopian bean, which Robert clearly said was a more expensive bean) with Robert for a good 40 minutes and 15 minutes past his closing hour of 6pm.  Service was great and Robert is an awesome barista.  Our first time here and I'll definitely stop by on my weekly visit to Pt. Loma.< /text>

<review>California pest control is the best company out there. My technician, David, does an excellent job and I literally haven’t seen a bug on my property in months! I highly recommend You give them a call. James and Mark are the best termite inspectors in the business and helped make purchasing a home easy and safe!</review>< Pics>

Needed a pest inspection prior to the sale of a home. Heard amazing things about California Pest Control. James came and did a very thorough inspection. On time, professional, courteous. David was then sent in to treat areas that were affected by termites. The customer service with CPC is out of this world. They know their stuff! The whole team is well educated, yet humble and helpful. They know their competition and what tactics other companies are employing that lead to failure to control the bugs and ultimately getting more money from their customers. David went above and beyond anything expected from our service with them. My family was grieving the loss of a loved one (hence the sale of the home) and the interaction with David and the team over those few days touched our hearts. They are more than a pest control company. I wish they did more services so we had excuses to hire them again. If you are looking for a group of professionals that not only have the education and skills, but are helpful and kind on EVERY a level, please give them a try. Stellar company, which is hard to find these days!!<//text>

<Text>Kyle and John were very professional and helpful with the needs of my pest control.  They both listened and took the time to give me suggestions to help prevent critters coming into my home ie…door sweeper for the garage door. I am very happy with their service and look forward to doing business with them.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

We've tried other companies and had continuous problems. We finally decided to call California Pest Control & hopped on a bi-monthly plan and we have not seen anything in months! They are also extremely professional. Dave will call to give updates and check in on problems in and around the house. I also love that they have a feature to pay online. We are going to continue service with them, I love the preventive measures and peace of mind that California Pest Control has given our family.< /Text>

Ryan B came out to inspect our home.  I informed him that mice have invaded our home.  He said that he found mice and RAT droppings were present.... rat?? oh gross...  not what an earlier rep notified us about.  Ryan also offered to repair the outside vents to prevent the rodents from entering our home-- my husband was sold at the mention of someone else providing that service!  Happy campers here!  Thank you Ryan!< /text>

Our technician (Ryan) was very responsive to our rodent problem. He explained what was needed to be done and immediately went to task. When he came back to inspect the traps he explained what was going to happen on the next visit. When he said he would be back on a certain day and time he was there as promised.  Very professional and customer service organization. I would highly recommend Ca Pest Control to anyone with pest issues.</Text>

As a small business owner it’s nice to still see that customer service is still the top priority for this company. Crawling through subfloors , hot attics , and just the plain hot days of the summer. Not one complaint from any of the employees. Always a friendly smile with a hello and good bye. Our experience with the owner Greg  and his guys deserve 10 stars!! Best guys ever!!! Thank you Ca Pest Control for everything!<//Review>

I came from a apartment complex that used CALIFORNIA PEST CONTROL. I've had different pest control companies in the past that have not been nearly as effective as this company. As most people it's embarrassing to have to admit that you have a pest problem. The I was assigned John Stevens while I was at my apartment complex. I was terrified I had bed bugs. he was very professional and understanding, he went room by room with me. I recently moved in to a house and wanted to protect myself from the previous infestation. I acquired services through California pest control. I knew right away what company to go to. I called and asked for John. he came out and immediately began a walk through with me, we came up with a plan that wold best fit my needs. we chose the every other month which is the best way to go. your covered for anything and every with just one low monthly cost. John is a very kind and gentle guy, he's very courteous and honest. he will answer all of your questions and even identify bug for you. just to have someone come into your home after being on edge because you have pest, while being treated with respect like your a old friend that John, it doesn't get any better than that. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND JOHN STEVENS, this company is great. if more people went with California pest control we could all eliminate the pest together. thank you very much John.</text>

I had a few different companies come out for a termite problem and I was not confident in any of them so I called a friend and asked if she had a referral. That’s how I came into contact with James. He was informative, professional, and personable. I appreciated his honesty in not trying to sell me on services for pests we knew I didn’t have. The other companies all had done so, without exception. And James was the only one of them who followed up with me.
The office staff was unlike the other companies as well. They were courteous and professional. The other companies’ staff left me asking, “Why am I even dealing with these people?” It’s sad that decent customer service should be a bonus and not a standard, but I definitely got it here.
And on my treatment day Dave was just a genuinely nice man to deal with. Even my grumpy old dog appreciated his manners. I couldn’t be happier with my decision to use California Pest Control.</Text>

I wanted to give a rave review to the Technician that came to address the insect issues in my place. Kyle was super professional, knowledgeable and respectful.  He even wore shoe covers when he entered my place. Rarely you see pleasant technicians these days like the one from California Pest Control.< /text>

Dave was very thorough and professional. Even came half an hour before the start time. My husband and I are delighted and highly satisfied of the services offered and want to give Dave a personal thank you and recommendation. We live in an apartment complex and was greeted with nothing but professionalism and courtesy. Dave sprayed inside the apartment and outside our apartment unit. Dave was very knowledgeable and handled everything with care. I cannot recommend enough: California Pest Control is the way to go. If you're unsure, give them a call and get it done right the first time! Thank you Dave!!< /review>

We had a bad ant problem and it took several visits.  The owner called me personally and came to my home and did the work, so I was happy.  I wouldn't use any one else.  I have and they all sucked.  These guys are great.  Communication is fabulous.  Staff is pleasant and responsive.

Ryan was great.  He came in and did an assessment of my problem with Drain/Fruit flies. He was knowledgeable and spent some time looking for where they maybe coming from.  He explained he was unable to find an entry and that it was possible there maybe a pipe leak between the walls and it seems he was right.  Plumber will fix leaking pipe.  Thanks Ryan.  I am sure I will be calling you for Maintenance Service soon.<//review>

He is extremely friendly with a very kind and gentle demeanor. It felt like I made a friend today and he shared that he was going to be my normal tech. They assign one to each customer which is nice to always know who will be coming to your home.

< review>
These guys are like family. I love Steve and have been with this company for about 9 years now.
They are super knowledgeable, helpful, and
kind. They have the best customer service anywhere.  Having a rental with a lot of issues, they’ve always gone out of their Way to do a thorough and complete job, making sure the property Was well taken care of despite having difficult tenants to work
Around.They’ve also serviced my personal home
and take care of issues quickly and with great professionalism. I will never use another company and never recommend anyone else to my
Family and friends.You will always be with good hands with these guys and I can’t thank them
Enough for the great job they always do!< /review>

Cal Pest Control was highly recommended and didn't disappoint .
As with all projects there are all ways unforeseen surprises. They kept me in the loop and found solutions in real time. I live in New York and needed very much a hands-on contractor. Cal Pest was that and more. I would absolutely advise anyone with pest issues hire this competent firm.<//review>

<Review>I have been working with California Pest Control for many years! They do amazing work and ALWAYS stand by their word, even though there's a work order signed by all parties, they do what it takes to keep things moving forward.The best thing I love about CPC is they will look at other repair costs from other companies & compete with their bid so the sellers/buyers can afford the work to be done and we can close in a timely manner! I have to say I have never been disappointed with the work performed and how professional the all are!!

Thank you for your service!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

I chose CA Pest Control because of great reviews on Yelp. I contacted them for a family member who had a severe roach and rodent issue. I have received the service expected. My calls and questions are answered in a timely manner. Appointments have been made to accommodate my schedule. And reminders about appointments are valuable. Thank you Steve for being kind and courtesy at each service call.<//text>

<Review>Great company! Honest, helpful, reliable and personable. My pest control guy, Steve, gives me a call/text the day before he is going to come to remind me to keep my backyard gate unlocked so he has access to spray. He also asks if there are any pest problems that may need some extra attention. Steve is always friendly and professional. I believe in supporting small local business.< /Review>< Time>

I will recommend all the home sellers and real estate agents to do termite pre-inspection, so you know if there is any problem and fix it with your own contractor prior put the house on market.  As most of the lenders will ask for section one clearance certificate prior funding, you don 't want to wait until last min. I have done several termite inspections through James, his very knowledge and professional and know what's his doing and give good advice how to take care the problems found.< /review>

We had ants in our home for years. Sometimes we would wake up to trails with thousands of ants. There was no way we could leave any food on the counter, or in the pantry unless in was sealed shut. I finally called California Pest Control. They are very good at what they do. Immediately our ant problem was over. It has been over a year since I've seen even one ant in our home. Let them rid you of your pest problem for good.</Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I hired California Pest Control for my own home and Steve did an awesome job! I had a bad problem with roaches. Reliable, retuned calls and responded to all concerns promptly.
I had previously used another company and was so disappointed. It seemed as though the roaches multiplied after their visit.
The very first time Steve from California Pest Control treated, the problem was taken care of the first time.
Haven’t had any roaches since!
I will never use any one else! I have also used them for my rentals because there was a bedbug problem there, it was scheduled and they an awesome job removing every trace of bedbugs!

They were excellent! Greg, the owner, came out and assessed the problem and John came out twice, two weeks apart and got rid of the problem. They were both very professional. John was thorough and did an amazing job! We've lived in the same home for 15 years and never had any pest control issues. It's been almost 7 months since they came out and we've not seen one "uninvited" guest. Pest control is one of those services you never want to use, but if we ever needed to again, we would call California Pest Control without a doubt. I highly recommend them!< /Text>

their service works. before i moved into my house i had these big nasty roaches in my garage. some smaller ones was in my house. plus i had spiders. after using CPC for couple of months, i say after the 2nd and 3rd time, the presence of bugs diminished! great job. only downside, is price, and sometimes they are difficult to get a hold off via email, but they do respond when you call. i like how they allow online payments too via paypal, very convenient for me.< /Review>

<response>{'time': 1620085403690, 'text': 'Hi Ms. Zoaya. As we discussed the reason for your upset issue, this weekend we made over 20 vegan pizzas.\nWe have not had any other reports  of illness or issues.\nWe extended an offer of other pizzas or any item on the menu at a later time as you would like.\nI sincerely hope that you feel well and will contact other customers from this past weekend regarding their pizzas.\nThank you.'}</response>< Text>
This past weekend my boyfriend and I ordered two pies one was the Gourmet Garden Pizza and the second was a vegan pie. I don’t know what they did but the pizza smelled like feet, and gave us upset stomachs. I called the manager at the encino location and instead of offering to refund us, or even show any sympathy she was very defensive and claimed there was nothing wrong with their pies. Between the very expensive pies and being sick I do not recommend this place. And it’s sad because I’ve placed orders from here before but this experience has turned me off. Do not buy.</Text>

Easy to order through google if you don’t have food delivery apps. Parking is scarce in that area. There is a small lot right behind it but I imagine that fills up quick in the day time or when they are able to dine in again. Got vegan build your own. DELICIOUS! Great vegan pizza from a not-fully vegan restaurant. I love that they give you a choice between Daiya and Follow Your Heart cheese because most places have Daiya only and that’s the worst non-dairy cheese made. Only thing I’ll do next time is ask for extra sauce. It’s a great pizza with the amount served but I’m a saucy kinda guy.< /Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><text>So many times I tried this place, disappointed every time.  It is nothing like the one that was in Woodland Hills, which was the best . This time we ordered spaghetti and meatballs, oh my God... the pasta tastes horrible. I don't know if it is left over from yesterday or if they freeze it and cook it again when someone orders but something is wrong with it.  The taste and the texture is very strange, plus lots of it is stuck in clumps and has a powdery texture when you eat it. The meatballs are pork I think,  hopefully cooked properly. The bread rolls are big, they come with frozen butter.  The salad is good. I stopped getting pizza from this place because it was not the same quality as the place in Woodland Hills.  Think I'm done ordering from here forever.  What a waste of money.<//text>< pictures>

I was in a pinch because Starbucks down the street lost power and I called this pizza place and they said I could use the WiFi. I’d say this was good luck because it’s so much more cozy compared to Starbucks. The atmosphere is way better at The Pizza Cookery anyway! 10/10 for the mozzarella sticks too.<//Review>

My bad mood was started in the first second. I was waiting cashier few minutes. Their prices was high, but I thought «hmm... may be that Italian family guys cooking very tasty. I want to try it!”. After I ordered “to go”, lady told me wait for 15-20 min. I was sit and start serf menu. And most important INFORMATION! They give free appetizers for good reviews! That’s the only reason why their rete good! We took pizza home and not surprised- it very bad. Not cooked well, terrible tastes. Worst experience and money spending!

<text>I don't know where to start. I loved The Pizza Cookery in Woodland Hills, but that one closed so I tried this one. I want to clarify that the service was very good, but the actual food was a different story.

The minestrone soup tasted like it was reheated from several days or even weeks ago and it was mostly flavorless. The bread rolls were good and fresh. The mozzarella sticks were good, but not better than the ones you can but at a grocery store. The pizza was bad as well. It was like they took the dough for pita bread, spread canned tomato sauce on it, some cheese and pepperoni, then threw it in an oven to warm up. There was no flavor other than the tomato sauce flavor out of a can.

Sorry, but I will definitely not return.< /text>< UserId.>

So delicious and fulfilling!!! Inclusive to all!!! I Have the gluten-free clam chowder with bread sticks and loved it so much got an order to go. I also got the gluten-free chocolate cake and it was so rich and creamy! My boyfriend got the  chicken raviolis and he absolutely loved it! Michele was so hospitable and suggested I try their pizza the next time and my boyfriend would like to try the calzone so we will definitely be back! Thank you and Merci!</Review>

<review>I was suprised by the quick delivery from Slice. The menu was easy . I though a little  $$$ on pizza which was not to my taste or my daughter who is a pizza freak. I also ordered the tuna salad which was wonderful  with ranch dressing. They give you big portions on both the small and medium size. Their garlic rolls are also wonderfully made. Again my daughter is also a garlic freak. I have ordered two different times and was pleased except for the pizzas.  They offer a wide variety of items from gluten free , vegan , pasta , sandwiches.  I will differently be ordering again.< /review>< pics>

<text>Oh, we just came from The Pizza Cookery!  The same warm family runs this amazing little gem of a restaurant. We've been coming since my son used to play with his tiny trucks and cars on the sawdust floor.  Now he's 23 and loves their generous and filling portions! They have the most delicious food and elaborate menu covering everything you could desire, even a wide selection of vegan and gluten-free options.  We always get the Pizza Special with their amazing salad and refreshing drinks.  Oh, everything was mouthwatering yummy!  The Pizza is loaded with cheese and your toppings, cooked to perfection.  The rolls are soft, with a buttery garlic flavor!   The salads are delicious and filled to the brim with salad and all the goodies!  Everything is brought with the warmest of service and they always remember what we love.  The service is excellent and friendly, their food melts in your mouth, the prices are great with so many options, the atmosphere is cozy with big, roomy booths, and they even have 3 big TVs, it's got something for everybody.  I hope you treasure it as much as we do.  It's our very favorite spot for Fantastic Italian Food and the Best Service!  Thank you Pizza Cookery!  We'll see you soon!</text>< Pics>

Very good pizza and salads. I have been coming here since the late 70s, and the owners (2nd) have done an excellent job: the recipes have remained pretty much the same and, the quality of the food and ingredients is undiminished. They are known for their garlic rolls, their pizza (also available as gluten free) and excellent salads. Service here is always friendly. Prices are fair but moderate.< /text>

Excellent pizza
Good family atmosphere,  lighting is great, and just the service is amazing. The food tastes so good and it makes me just too want more. Especially the garlic bread they serve just makes me want more refills on it. I would definitely come back! Just stunning!< /Text>

<review>Good as usual.  First time at this location, pizza rolls were cold and hard, asked for fresh ones...which were cold but not hard.  Normally great food.  Parking at this location is a challenge.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< user_id>

<Response>None<//Response><text>Excellent pizza, with a thin New York or thick Chicago crust.  Many other popular Itallian dishes are available. Sauces are full bodied, rich and flavorful, East Coast style. Servings are large.

Most of the menu is available as conventional, vegan, or gluten free. A selection of conventional meats, as well as, vegan "meats" and "cheeses" are offered. There are two menus: vegan/gluten free and conventional. The knowledgeable and friendly servers lead you through the decision making process.  Salads are large, crisp and fresh. Hot, just out of the oven, vegan dinner rolls, at extra charge, as well as, conventional rolls are served.

And, in the tradition of the Chicago pizza restaurants, a carpet of sawdust covers the floor.

The mood is intimate, perhaps a bit romantic. Wine and beer are served. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.

Free parking in the small lot behind the restaurant and street parking. Wheelchair accessible including bathrooms.<//text></record>

Very good Pizza in my mind! The ladies are very helpful! I really enjoy the no sauce pizza! Wish they had corporate approval to use a Garlic infused Olive Oil sauce as an alternative! The Spicy BBQ Wings is the best in my book compared to other restaurants! The manager does a great job with her staff, they seemed to be organized and very friendly! My favorite pizza is the Pepperoni, Red Onion, and two orders with no sauce! Plenty of Cheese on thin crust or Hand Toss. The store is conveniently located to my home location.< /Review>

The last time I was at the Encino store was in the 90's . I worked in a bank next  to the Encino store and I love their salad and Pizza. I moved to the bay area and been living here for a while and recently I had the chance to visit Southern California. My wife and I visited the valley and to my surprise we passed by the same store that I used to have lunch 25 years ago. We decided to have the same food that I used to eat and to my surprise the quality of food did not change a bit. Their salad roll maintained its quality and their pizza is as good as it was before. And that goes with the salad too. I would give a five star to this place.</Review>

Service started quite normally, but, we were late diners. So, service towards the end of our meal turned quite sour. Our server seemed VERY upset. I was quite understanding for our late dinner so I left a generous tip even though I felt that we were rushed out and felt uneasy.

The pizza was so bad my stomach still hurts. Dry hard crust.Where was the sauce? Dry terrible pizza. This was THE WORST Pizza my date and l have eaten in my entire life. You would better in taste and quality to get a frozen RED BARON pizza which would  be better in taste than what I ate. Your pizza is overpriced and really
SUCKS. Never Again $#&#% The WORST!!!< /Review>

The atmosphere is family friendly with a good vibe, it's not pretentious or trendy and it has the charm of being a place to kick back and enjoy your meal.

My favorites are the garlic rolls, the chicken wings are better than most wing places, the 5 cheese, BBQ chicken and meat lovers thick crust are heaven, the calamari is tasty and their Antipasto salad is incredible.  They also have a nice variety of beer and wine but the best thing is you're felt rushed to eat and leave like many other busy restaurants.

This is a family run business who does everything possible to make sure you enjoy your meal.  The prices are excellent, the portions are huge, the menu has something for everyone in the family, they use fresh ingredients and they also have a great vegan and kids menu.

There may be more trendy or chic places out there, but if you're looking for a real home cooked comfort food meal that's always a step above everyone else, the Pizza Cookery is the place to go.  It's been our go to place since I was a kid.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

I got a small antipasto salad and it came with garlic bread rolls!!!! I ordered it to go and got home and the bread was hot and the salad was crisp and cold... Super yummy!!!!!! I didn't even need the butter they had in the bag because the bread was so good!!!! The salad and bread are easily enough to serve 2 people!!!! It was a little busy so I was worried it was going to take a while but it barely took 5 mins!!!!!! I recommend this awesome place to everyone!!!!!!! I will definitely be going back to try the gluten free options soon!!!!!< /text>

<review>I am a frequent customer to this Pizza cookery. Most of the time I opt for delivery, however I will also pickup. Delivery is always within the time limits they give. When doing pickup, the kids like the game room when the games are not broke. They also have a big screen to watch sports while you wait or eat your food. The location is very clean. I prefer Pizza cookery over the other local pizza places. The food is always hot even when delivered. Going to get mine now.</review>< Pictures>

There was a coupon that didn't have restrictions on it, but they said it wouldn't work for the vegan food. I understand it's a bit different for that stuff, but the way they treated us was horrible. Extremely rude service. We ended up ordering anyway because we were starving. The pizza I got was alright ( not as for as the woodland hills one).We took the leftovers home and I found hair in my pizza and ended up tossing it. I called them and they tried to resolve it, but after that experience it just wasn't worth it. I would just say to just go the Woodland Hills location; which has better service and food.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Food is good. It's Pizza Cookery by name only. Except for the sawdust floor its not the same as the original. The rolls are just OK, the pizza was decent. Not a bad place just a little underwhelming.<//text>< user_name>

<Text>I love the authentic pizzas here.They make your order as you like it and fast. Sometimes I order ahead since my lunch break is only half an hour, and they have everything ready when I arrive.
My go to favorite is their tasty combo for one(pizza, salad, drink and almost forgot those addicting
rolls). How can you beat that for $8.99 !  See you soon for another one :)<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>I tried to like this place, I did. But there were so many warnings signs...

Things I liked:
- The salad.
- Price on individual combo. Less than $10 for a small pizza, salad, bread & drinks is nice!
- Not noisy, big room.

Things I disliked:
- I hate places where I have to struggle to find parking.
- They didn't honor the Yelp Deal I paid for because they said the combo I bought was already discounted (but it's printed on the menu and therefore is not an "offer," but simply a combo much like you would purchase at a fast food joint.
- The Pizza. Sauce killed it for me, tasted like they bought some premade pasta sauce and tossed it on top.
- The floor. When I first visited a pizza cookery, I thought this was cute but later I started thinking it was terribly unhygienic. Do they bother sweeping when something drops on the floor? Can you even tell?<//review>< user_name>

The pizzas were cooked too long, so the crust was tough. (Second time this was the case.) We ordered pepperoni and meatball, but got pepperoni and mushroom.  $71 for two pizzas and a salad is outrageous.  The to-go menus do not show the accurate prices, so were were unprepared for the high grand total.  We used to eat here often, but I think we are done.<//text>

<text>My experience was really a mixed bag of good-bad-neutral, which in itself was kind of disconcerting.

I came mid-afternoon on a weekday, so I presume the manager had the floor while waiting for the next server. She seemed bored and uninterested, and disappointingly, she actually flinched when I admitted that I'd be using a Groupon voucher (seriously, it felt like an admission—like I'd done something wrong😟—going by her countenance).

That—and the utterly disappointing garlic rolls—constitute the "bad."

In contradistinction, the “goods” were d@*n good.  The garlic was fresh; the cheese was perfectly melted and the flavors robust. Also, when the scheduled server arrived, she jumped right in to her role [unlike the begrudging manager] and kindly checked in periodically.

All in all, the lesson learned is to go during peak hours.< /text></record></dataset><record>

To be honest I thought this was a pizza place but they actually have a variety of foods from bomb salads, to pastas, and so much more all at an affordable price!

Upon entering we were greeted by a hostess who sat us right away. Our server mike is awesome, attentive and super friendly! He refilled our waters twice without us having to ask, and he provided us with such great service and always kept checking up on us as well as asking how the food is and how everything's going every now and then .  Great personality. When you have delicious dishes as well as a really good service - your whole dining experience is 100x better.

We ordered pasta for our son which came with apple juice. The kids pasta I must admit  is large enough for an adult!</text>

<Time>1410637095394<//Time><Rate>5</Rate><text>So I've lived in Encino for over 3 years now, and I'd sort of given up on finding a pizza place that was as good as my favorite LA joint. I do like Rusty's, but it's no Mulberry Street Pizza.

I dream of the big, floppy slices that you fold in half, with a slightly crispy crust, tangy/spicy sauce, gooey cheese, and lots of garlic. Little did I know that my perfect slice was right there on Figueroa Street the whole time.

It could be that most times I'm down in that area, But I lucked out last Saturday night -we needed a quick bite before a show and every other place was packed. It was open and only had one patron, so we ventured in. My slice was like the pizza I'd been dreaming of ever since I left LA. It was perfect, and I probably could have eaten half a pie if I'd had the time. My salad was also delicious with the perfect amount of what tasted like homemade dressing. My fiance got a panino sandwich with meatballs which looked really cheesy and delicious.

What made the experience even more wonderful was that we were both satisfied for only $17 total. That is unheard of in Encino.  Thanks and keep up the great service again.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>This restaurant is the definition of a family restaurant. They play kids (disney) movies on the TV's but always have a couple games on as well.  It's a very nice relaxed atmosphere.  As far as the food goes, It's consistently very good and very reasonably priced for the quality of food you get.  From a pizza place I definitely did not expect the food to be that good, it beats the heck out of any place like that any day.  This is the type of restaurant when you want Italian food you go there 3-4 times a month.  Blissimo!</text>< pics>

We stopped in on a week night for a pizza and a antipasta salad. Service was excellent, the small antipasta was enough for two of us as an appetizer. Very fresh and excellent italian dressing. We had a specialty medium pizza with green peppers, pepperonni, mushrooms and sausage. Crust was very good, no grease on the bottam at all.  Will be back again :)< /review>

The *other* Pizza Cookery is the good one. This one felt like such a rip-off, unfortunately.<//Text>

< review>
We're so happy they opened this pace in downtown Concord! Inside looks cute and clean. Service is always nice and you are able to taste test a little sample (love that). The mango flavor is delicious and refreshing for those hot days! I've also had their shaved ice which was long lasting. My ice however wasn't fully covered in flavor, some parts was just ice. I plan to try it one more time just in case that day was just an off day. Overall happy to have this place near by and can't wait to return.<//review>

<rate>4< /rate><text>The gelato is flavorful and there is a reasonable variety of flavors. The shop is clean. The portion size is a bit small so I recommend ordering a couple scoops per person. They didn't have the panini gelato. The bathroom is unavailable, perhaps due to COVID-19 restrictions. I don't recommend the shake as it dilutes the flavor. Handicap accessible doorways and bathroom.< /text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNWbbxHKfRBXgPZJOeQuEOuvWzhHsfJ7XgmeLSJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxXgo3xNJjz_8I4VdIvQaD3ILXvPoJLwo4bNWC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyxf61a7L7cjWfF6jCMpk_F8NKyo9g5Dk_kIWG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzFX7J591hY1mIBBtBmAwLthWyvIC5sRHsBuZB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnh9RZ2vNTbUeOkl4C2CXigNNsynB6JjJ1sdpt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_rVNwVt8V-C1Jm6us0HFEXvD6WhCGyW6L-jRB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6kGM86gAPVO2xGxfTxsPMsbAigQDQT7acjTEf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP_BHRTQBLbxyPetTM0D0QBCs1OSD93waqoKQ6c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPw2jLh33KAkQv8Ok3OE5S-vFechS6nzOTuD1-2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP2463Nb8G59vMWp2XFdCOCZTjQ4WeLga61WxxG=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOmmLFRgkZ45fVn47jU7ScpMvrpYjh8300wbPAt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOp_eVJiFhcod9regWMyrGX5P_nqv-RAbQMMNZo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzM6Z9iAG5Bm5UhABTG9n2HBf2OT7C1jPSv3XU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I stumbled upon this place on the way to the parking garage. I had a taste for ice cream. I wanted to treat my grandson and myself to something special. When we entered, we were welcomed.

Freddy was behind the counter. He said we could try whatever flavor we wanted. In fact, he offered several flavors. Each were the most delicious I’ve tasted! My grandson agrees! We got the 5 flavor box container for $15! We chose mango, strawberry, pistachio, dark chocolate and popcorn!

We will come again and definitely tell people about this hidden gem!

Sam also worked there and mentioned their flavors change.

They’re offering FREE ice cream on Valentines Day between 5p-7p! Spread the word! 😃<//Review>< pics>

Took a chance at the new ice cream shop in Todos Santos Plaza and I'm glad I did! They make each flavor fresh daily and have a great selection. I was offered a sample of the banana ice cream and it was so good I ended up ordering it! I'm looking forward to trying more flavors.</text>

Yummilicious. This teacher was just in the area to get some Peet's Coffee when what should she see, but a GELATO shop? Yesss!  It did not disappoint. I opted for the salted caramel and I'd do it again!< /Review>

Oh my god, one of the best Afghan ice cream in the Bay Area. The ice cream is not an ordinary vanilla but it's a true yellow vanilla that was casted and created from whole milk. The outcome of this product is superb, delicious, tasty and very very cold.

If you like Afghan sheer yakh and don't want to drive to Fremont to pay 15 dollars for some garbage fake Afghan sheer yakh then come to the concord store and enjoy this delicious crafted Afghan ice cream and they also have many more delicious ice creams to serve.<//text>

I heard from friends that they have good sheer Yakh (Afghan ice cream) and I live in Elk Grove Sacramento which is one and half hour away decided to go with my family and try the sheer yakh and it was well worth it. They sure did had best sheer yakh and excellent customer service. Will sure be back with no regret.< /Review>

Very Delicious and different from other ice creams! Theres no place that serves Italian gelato in town so this is definitely different and special .All the flavors are honestly amazing.Would recommend to all and they also serve a special ice cream called sheer yakh which is specially made!</Text>

< Review>
I ordered the “Sweetest Surprise” bouquet for mom on Mother’s Day and they truly delivered my loving sentiment. The arrangement was even more beautiful than shown in its description. Aladdin’s goes above and beyond sourcing fresh gorgeous florals and arranging them into an amazing bouquet. The detail was impeccable. I highly recommend them. I ordered online with no fuss and received professional customer service and delivery. Thank you Aladdin’s.< /Review>

<Review>I stopped by to get some flowers but wasn't sure what kind would last long for the cemetery.  The lady helped me pick and made me a beautiful bouquet with different type of flowers.  Their customer service is good. Can't talk about the prices because I honestly don't shop for flowers often so I wouldn't know.  But I was happy with my bouquet to say the least.  I do recommend this flower shop.</Review><gmapID>0x80dcd9b73810ea45:0x5516cd27a4a54ef2</gmapID>< date>

<Text>It has been a Long Winter. Aladdin Gift Flowers sent my friend Springtime in a vase!  They put together a beautiful arrangement of many different elements. The flowers and the presentation are just beautiful!  They were delivered in only a few hours! It made my friend very happy that that made me very happy too.  I highly recommend this shop!< /Text>< user_name>

This was the third time I bought flowers from this shop.  They are affordable, very well done, super fresh, great quality, and every time now have lasted me for more than a week and a half after the purchase date.  The owner is very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely be a returning customer.</review>

Sent my friend flowers, and even though I selected the most basic option, they were not 'basic' at all! They were so beautifully arranged, fresh, and delivered quickly. Would definitely order from here again.< /review>

<Text>I visited Aladdin Gift  Flowers on one of the busiest days of the year for all florists, Valentine's Day 😱. I knew it would be busy, and I expected all staff to be short due to being stressed out with nonstop customers, questions, and phone calls. They were the opposite. Patient, helpful, and really understanding. I know absolutely nothing about flowers and purchasing them, but I had all of my questions answered when I showed up on my lunch break to assess the shop. When I came back after work, they were still amazing, and very patient, helpful, and understanding. I will be returning in the future for sure, and not just for valentine's day! Also, they have very affordable prices. Me having never been to a florist, I was happy that the pricing wasn't high, especially given the circumstances of the particular day it was!<//Text><Date>1581799451706<//Date>< Response>

I recommend her to all of my friends, most of them just live way too far away (out of state) and think it's too risky to use her. Even if I had to have someone bring flowers from her Ontario store to Las Vegas, I would have done it... now that wasn't the case but I'm just trying to put it in perspective. She is a wonderful business woman and an even more amazing florist.<//text>

<review>The ladies at Aladdin are incredible. I've purchased, for delivery, 3 times with no let down.

Im active military so dont have much free time on my hands. I entered in the incorrect street address on one occasion and my arrangement still found its way. I definitely appreciated that. Thanks ladies!</review>< userid>

Alladin Gift Flowers went over and above the call of duty.  I wanted a customized flower arrangement for my Uncle's funeral and they made a special effort to put little guitars on it since he used to play the guitar.</text>

Ordered flowers for my mom the Saturday during Mother's Day weekend and had same day delivery! The flowers are in great shape and not fully bloomed so they'll last a while. The delivery person was very nice and courteous. Thank you for your excellent service.</text>

Ladies are extremely pleasant and helpful not to mention very talented and knowledgeable in this field.  Besides great customer service, the selection of flowers and plants are gorgeous.  I like to go in about every two weeks and they'll help me pick out about 5 - 10 dollars worth flowers for my home.  Teaching me to become florist.  Thank you ladies!!! (And for the vending machine too ;)) hehe. Xoxo< /text>

I order flowers to be sent to my wife at least once a month and since she began working in SF I have tried numerous flower shops and online delivery services.  However, none of them remotely compare to the quality of product and timeliness of delivery that I have received every time from Elizabeth's Flowers.< /Text>

I called and ask for the most beautiful arrangement for my mother's birthday, I live out of state so I was taking a chance not knowing what I was going to get for her. Later that day my mother called crying saying it was beautiful. Full of different flower.. Can't thank the lady enough for making my mother's birthday even more special... Gave the lady a price and she worked with it.. So thank you very much and will definty will be calling you again..</Text>

I’m 19 years old and signed up for the eureka crate, I was worried, at first, that it would be too easy, but it’s a very fun challenge. It’s exciting to see which project I will receive. Shipping has never been a problem. I decided to end my subscription, however, because I believe I have had enough fun with it, also because the crates are $30 on average. Besides that, I’ve enjoyed it.<//Review>

<review>The product has been great, but the 5 stars are even more for the customer service. I've dealt with them twice, and both times they were able to take care of the issues politely, efficiently, and without issue. They don't bounce you from person to person; you can take care of seemingly any issue (or at least both issues I had) on the online chat. I'm very impressed.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb717f76ea77d:0xbc2d8249c88108e<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>We love Kiwi Crates. It’s the best gift idea, best rainy day activity and more. My 5 year old absolutely loves when a crate arrives and is so proud of each activity he builds. We have done monthly subscriptions and purchased one time crates as well. Out of all the crates we have done, we had one with a missing item. But customer care was quick and easy with their online messenger, and very kind. Can’t recommend these enough!< /Text>< pictures>

We tried out a Kiwi and Atlas crate in November and my 6 year old daughter and I are hooked!  We have thoroughly enjoyed every crate that has come in.  I even got myself a Maker crate to try out and really loved that too.  I didn't get a crate for my 2 year old, and think that it may not be worth the price for the younger ages, but anything elementary age and up are definitely worth it.  Look for specials, they seem to constantly have promo codes to get a discount off a first box or to buy kits from the store (instead of a subscription).  Will definitely be renewing in November when our yearly subscription is up.</Text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Dealing with the customer care team was a pleasurable experience. The representative Wade addressed all my concerns in a quick, friendly and attentive manor exceeding my expectations. So far I’ve received two krates, and my daughter has instantly gravitated towards them. I love the bonding experienced they have brought and watching how my child is developing while playing with the educational toys.</Review>< pictures>

My kids really like the KiwiCo crates; we've been getting them for a couple of years now.  I love how all of the mateirals needed come in the box and they indicate the level of difficulty, the messiness, and what's required for each project, as it helps me select which project to do.  Shelby's assistance was really helpful.  She resolved my need and provided clear and helpful responses.</Text>

We really love the crates, the instructions are easy to follow and the kids like it. But they don’t have an option to make both boxes the same one, so we end up with fights and competition regarding who gets what box. We were hoping to get both the same so we could sit down as a family and complete the projects all together.</Text>

<Text>The crates itself are good in terms of variety and quality. However the management is quite poor. I had been on monthly plan and then switched to yearly plan and this has not updated properly for about 2 months. I had to call the customer service multiple times to check. My subscription info on the website and what CS person says is not synced up, which is very confusing to me.< /Text>< pictures>

I'm in the UK and have had 3 boxes for my daughter and 4 for myself.  I've just contacted the customer service team and they were very quick in answering my question.  Really pleased with the quality of the crates and even though delivery is slow at the moment I think that's a result of Covid rather than any thing else.  Hoping to be a subscriber for a long time :)</Text>

Crates have been age appropriate and my granddaughters love them! One subscription was duplicated rather than linked to an order by another relative, but Kiwico found the oversight and promptly sent new themed replacement crates.</Text>

<review>Currently waiting for a second month shipment for my 2 kids. A bit annoyed with the fact I have emailed them 2x now about questions about the packages and subscriptions and no response.  I also looked at this month's box in my profile and my children are getting 2 completely different shipments. I ordered them under the impression they would both be getting matching shipments each month.  This was the case with month 1 but month 2 no dice.  I'd love to speak to someone and get all my questions answered but it seems rather difficult.  Probably heading for a cancelation, as they seem to not make anything easy.< /review><userid>111385570589853844617< /userid><pictures>None</pictures></record>

I called and they said that they would send me the 2nd crate that should have been sent in October. I said, "No thank you" And asked for refund. They would not issue me one for November.

Dishonest, unprofessional, and overpriced business. They charged an annual subscription fee upfront but after the first two months, stop shipping out my subscription. I'm in the US, San Francisco, which is about just 30 min from their business location, so it's not about the shipping issue. It's about their system and how they run the business. Also, I check with my friend who also subscribed annual crates lives in same city as me, received all crates every month!<//Text>

I ordered one box from this people and then i unsubscribed until the box arrived to see how it is.
The box arrived many months later.
I recived the order confirmation email on 11 December 2019 but the mail office recive the package on 27 April 2020, they sent the package after discussions with support team...
On top of that two months after my first order (1 February 2020) they ignored my unsubscribtion and then charged my bank account and then refused to refund my bank account, but worse than that the box didn't arrived to this day 4 Noverber they charged me against my will and then they didnt even sent the box i didn't even orderd</text>

<Text>They have a good and creative product and my kids enjoyed building it but I’m not satisfied with the way Kiwico handles auto renewing subscriptions.
I had specifically signed up for a 1 months subscription and Kiwico automatically without any confirmation email ordered another crate for the next month.
There was no mention of an auto renewal when I first signed up for my first crate, and the difference between a termed subscription and an ongoing subscription is not clear.
My experience with the customer representative was good and she helped me out in resolving the issue (since the next month's crate was paid through the credits I earned, the representative helped me get back those credits to my account). But my husband and sister did not have the same experiences and their cards were billed, for the next month's crate which they had not opted for.< /Text>< Pics>

<username>Lixin Jiang<//username><date>1596401218929<//date><rating>1</rating><Text>My baby was born in May and I ordered the panda crate for my baby in July that is when they targeted me as a consumer on Facebook.

By the time the first crate that is designed for 0-2 month baby arrives which was the end of July, my baby was almost 3 month old.

I requested to move forward the shipment date of the second box (for 3-6 month baby) to sooner (Aug) than later (Sept); the first customer service rep told me to come back in Aug to request again, which I did. Then, the second customer service rep told me to change my baby's birthday to an earlier date, which I did.

Unfortunately, neither of these ways actually allowed me to change the shipment date. The second customer service rep indicates that they shipped this way to keep the cost of the shipping down, which doesn't make any sense because the total number of shipment doesn't change regardless of when to actually ship the box.

This company creates a good business concept; as parents, we often don't know which toys are appropriate to babies at different ages. However, I don't understand why they need to be so inflexible in the shipment dates; if you didn't order the crate at the beginning of the line (0-24 months; 2-4 years etc.) they arbitrarily set. Then, all of your boxes would be late for your baby. This is so ironic because they are supposed to fit toys with kids at different age.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>I had ordered a kiwico kit for my daughter and while placing the order clearly I had selected one time order and not subscribed for it monthly. The next month without any msg or notification kiwico sent me another order and charged me for the same. I immediately emailed them telling that I don't want the order and to return my money but it went to deaf ears! They told me henceforth they won't send me and this is the last package. The same thing happened with a friend. When you place and ordwr, make sure to go back and cancel the subscription which they add you in without your permission. I am disappointed and feel cheated by kiwico.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

As of 1:47 P.M. on Tuesday, June 9th, package is not delivered, no new update as to when it will be delivered, still the end of the business day on Monday, June 8th, 2020.  I sent an e-mail  inquiring as to what is happening and that I should expect an answer within 48-72 hours.  Last time user for this un customer friendly company.  No phone to contact them with.

We come here because it's the closet basketball court to our house. My niece is always able to find a pickup game here with other kids in the community.

Lincoln park is clean, well manicured, the equipment is in good shape, and the best part is the shade. There is shade exactly where it needs to be.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dc976b2d15db5d:0xd03e6e2ae33c2a7f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Beautiful place to walk at and to take kids to play. It just needs a restroom so people don't have to go all the way home.< /review>

< Review>
Took the kids to run off some steam after lunch its gorgeous with the palm trees and the offers great shade. Has benches to eat at spread out cozily. Has a nice playground and a basketball court. However it gets minus a star cuz who on earth makes a large patio for a kids park to have large groups of ppl to load up on liquids only to have to ride the whole family to the neighborhood subway to pee.. Needless to say, Its inconvenient. But other than that beautiful place.</Review>

My children enjoyed the park but, sadly the park doesn't have a restroom so that cut our fun time short. Restrooms are much needed come on especially with children!</review>

What an experience!!!

I haven’t been to sizzler since I was a lil kid! I went last Thursday because all the other restaurants we wanted to go too we’re had long waits. It was late after a graduation.

We sat down got a high chair for my 2 year old we noticed it was dirty so we asked was it sanitize the waitress said yes EVERY NIGHT! LOL so we all looked and said well it’s 8 at night was it cleaned today she said no but kids have came in but if WE want WE can go to table “over there and use the peroxide water!!!! I was so through!!

So the manager came by and we asked her she was like oh I can clean it for you, I said wow the waitress said we had to she said oh no I’m so sorry’ that’s not your job.

That was that the food came out about 1 hour later why I don’t know because it was only 3 other families in there with us! The food arrived cold!!! We all left with food on our plates! Fried shrimp was cold! Fries cold! Shrimp skewers undercooked and cold! Food in my sons and mother n laws cup! Stuck on the cup. Soup cup was dirty! I had all 12 chicken wings left because that was cold!  Steaks was not done! Lobster wasn’t done! Just gross!!! Bread was cold thin! I mean everything about that night in sizzler was pathetic!!

I can’t believe the experience we’ve had! No one cares it was like what ever you already paid too bad!</Text>

While Sizzler isn't high-end, it is a long time destination for people looking for a family restaurant serving a decent steak with other options like seafood and salads. This restaurant is clean with good seating and views. Staff is friendly and servers are good about checking up on patrons' needs. The food itself is typical Sizzler..it's fine. Prices are moderate.</text>

The food was delicious, but the service was poor. Tony our waiter was great, but he was pretty much working alone waiting on tables. Thank you Tony, hope you received the tip I left< /review>

<Review>Seems more delicious now that before Covid!  The steak was awesome, the fried shrimp crispy and huge, and the cheese toast... Ah, I MISSED THAT!!!  I think the baked potato got a tiny bit smaller though! 😁
Still haven't opened the salad bar (for obvious reasons) but hopefully soon enough.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

<review>The best thing about our visit on Mother's day was it was not crowded.  After eating the food I understand why. Our food was cold including the soup.  Our streak were way over cooked and dry and tuff. We didn't send them back for fear of an extra unwanted ingredient might be added. I was just happy to be out the house inside a restaurant.</review><GmapID>0x80c2b72e4901ef19:0xd67535ed82b9e85e< /GmapID><username>Monique Davis<//username>< userid>

<review>Very basic visit appeal. I guess because of the Covid Protocols, for instance they still aren't allowing salad buffets. You have to order first and they will make it for you. They didn't even put on the TV's while we were there but the waiter service was ok.<//review>< Rating>

Due to covid-19 in full effect The Sizzler is taking all precautions to prevent the spread of the disease. Outside seating was kind of romantic with my loved one. Service was great & our server was very attentive
Most importantly she was nice wit a beautiful personality. Food was hot & delicious
I really enjoyed my date @ Sizzle< /review>

The restaurant is very nice and we appreciated a lot what we ate here. It was very good. Meat is great and you can also take other food from a buffet. Everything we took was really good, staff was very courteous and eating here is not expensive.
We highly recommend this restaurant<//Review>

Great food great drinks great service and Awesome games! Service is cool waitresses are friendly sometimes over friendly lol  maybe it's the drinks talking but I always feel like they're flirting... well that's their job to get tips with friendly service. Always down for a connect four or janga challenge! Try the cucumber cooler it's a beast!</review>

< Review>
Overall, the portions were a healthy size for the price, and the food was fresh and flavorful.  My only real complaint was that I could have used more bread, especially with the tomato stew, which was screaming for bread.  On balance though, the place was well priced for great food, and the portions were good size, and the food was almost all uniformly excellent.< /Review>

Ordered the Steak & Grilled Shrimp Skewer medium rare

From left to right the streak went from well done to rare..it was all bad, not to mention my brother bit into his hamburger to find a piece of hair.

Also missing fries and clam chowder

Never eating here again<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Nothing brings me more hate from my closest friends and family than my love for Sizzler. I had a long lunch break and was able to come here for lunch and it was absolutely amazing! Take your time with the friendly server, cheese bread, unlimited salad bar, steak and veggies, and soft serve ice cream with toppings. Sizzler really is a "get what you pay for" type of place so if you are expecting something amazing, look elsewhere. But if you're patient and can vibe with the ambiance it's a really beautiful reprieve.< /Review>< Pics>

The service was impeccable the cashier helped me order a better deal, the 6 jumbo shrimps outside layer light crispy while the shrimp was juicy, clam chowder was so good with the cheese toast they give oh & the new fruit juice was just right with my meal. I will be back tomorrow for lunch because the food was good & the service was fast & they were very careful because of the coronavirus i really appreciate that...</Review>

<review>I haven't been to a Sizzler in a while but they've really stoop low in terms of the portions they give you nowadays. I hope it's just this Sizzler in particular the one by the LAX airport , but I don't see Sizzlers making more money if they literally only give you two items for $15.<//review>< Pics>

This spot is the one I always prefer. I visit a lot of restaurants but here I keep coming back again and again. The crew is very warm and the cuisine they place on your table is so appetizing. I never miss an opportunity to have a good dinner in this restaurant. I recommend this place with pleasure.<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><Text>Very high priced menu. Even the salad bar is basically 13$, nothing special just the ordinary. We came here at a last minute decision because someone closed down Hometown, Wonder who did that!? Anyways the service is cool. The guy who brought out the food was super duper nice, he should get a raise.  The food is alright. Don't get the shrimps (not very tasty). Overall it was a good experience. Being my first time here I did expect more, in the end I'm just thankful to have the opportunity to be able to pay for this experience. There is a lot of people who can't.<//Text>< Pictures>

<review>A little confusing if you've never visited.  The young lady taking our order tartly asked if we knew what we wanted. Of course,  we had no idea how the ordering system worked.  I told her that I had looked over the menu and,  unless the edge of my steak would be expertly decorated in gold leaf, I think I'll just order water. Post disarmament, she laughed and was delightfully helpful =)
Truthfully, the price was very reasonable considering we fed a family of 6...in California...for $120.
The steaks were impressive - juicy and cooked perfectly. The salad bar was fresh and more than adequate to complete a good steak dinner.
I don't think I could have asked for better. It was a last minute restaurant trip, and just a mile or so from LAX! We'll definitely return when we visit Cali again next year.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Best steaks for the price and boy you can just add a lobster tail for a few bucks 👌

It was my first time there, it looks like they used to have a salad bar, but now they bring you a mixed house salad 🥗</text>

Have not been to a Sizzler in a while after the last on I visited in Morgan Hill CA and charged extra for the Chicken wings on the Salad bar.  This location exceed expectations on the salad bar. The steaks would benefit from adding g seasoning on them. If cooked with salt, pepper and garlic, they would be amazing steaks.</Text>

Ordered the steak (medium) and grilled shrimp combo. Was considering adding the salad bar or even getting just that, but the salad bar wasn’t super impressive - a few types of lettuce and some salad toppings, fried chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, and a few flavors of jello and banana pudding for dessert.

The shrimp wasn’t cleaned very well and there were several chunks of shell on the main part of the shrimp that I had to peel off. The rice was so soaked in lemon that it was inedible.

I ordered my steak medium, and the first time it came out rare. When I got our server’s attention I sent it back. It went back on the grill (after going onto the table and being cut into - MAJOR health code violation) and around 5-7 minutes later came out very well done. I sent it back a second time and they sent out a new steak. Cooked just as rare as the first one.

The cashier, server, and manager were very nice and credited the difference between the shrimp skewers and the steak and shrimp combo, but that’s the only reason I feel this review even deserves a one star instead of the ‘I’m only giving one star because I can’t give zero’ ratings. I hadn’t been to a Sizzlers in many years and we only went because it was close to our hotel at LAX, and based on this visit I would have a hard time recommending it to others.<//text>

Always clean, can get crowded(especially for holidays). Salad bar is what I usually get, my favorite are the chicken wings, and sometimes they have Pozole in the soup section. If you want great service and are there during the day, ask if Tony is working and sit in his section. His service is always great, and will make you feel right at home.< /Review>

<time>1584065505979< /time><Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Great tasting food. Portion sizes are way off. Salad and ice cream bar are a great side order if you have kids. The wife and I enjoyed it but my portion size was way off from my wife I got the Chicken Malibu with mash potatoes for $13.99 and the wife got the baby back ribs with bbq chicken 14.99 and a salad bar 6.99. What a surprise when our meals came and my steak was 1” wide by about 10 inches long, the chicken malibu was a piece of breaded chick puck with a slice of ham and cheese, the mashed potatoes were the best part in a separate dish on the plate with salted melted butter. My wife’s 3 ribs were large and covered in bbq sauce her chicken was a actual breast char broiled I believe with a healthy helping of bbq sauce. Her baked potatoes was perfectly cooked and pressed open with there butter sauce added to it. She also had the salad bar which for her was great because it had a sea food salad in it which she loves. All together I was impressed with here’s and left hungry with mine. Heads up if you come here GET THE SALAD BAR, to make sure you meal is complete and not leaving you hungry.</Review>< Pics>

Sizzler the ultimate fast food killer. I love sizzler.
All fast food prices went up. So before you think about mc d's,  burger king or others go check out Sizzles. I had tri tip steak and a bake potatoes for 12.95. If you were at fast food places it would cost $10.00.  It makes good sense to spend $2.00 more.<//text>

So glad they are back. This is one of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Oakland. The food is delicious and always consistent. My favorites are the scallops, salmon, and the shrimp corn cakes are a great option that blends together so well. Don't leave without trying the chocolate souffle or the Panna Cotta.< /Review>

<review>This is your classic Sizzler, my nephew always gets the giant cheeseburger and fries and he loves it. Salad bar is kept fresh, we went for lunch typical busy mix of local businesses taking their lunch break and some neighborhood regulars enjoying a meal in the air conditioning, nice clean bathrooms. The crew was very friendly and helpful, nice and fast get you in sitting down and eating in just a few minutes. Only rub is parking is pretty tight, they have a valet there to help but could be a problem at lunch time.< /review></record>

The food was really good, like what I expect from the brand. The hostess was very friendly and helpful. The waitress, however, didn't remember I was there, I think, because it took a long time to come by my table and once she did, seems to have forgotten that I ordered a drink. She wasn't terrible. She was nice enough and smiled a lot, just wasn't very attentive.< /review>

<review>Bait & Switch.
Went in for the $6.99 lunch deal they have posted outside which was a burger or chicken plate or salad bar.
I asked for the salad bar which came out to $9.99.
I asked for the lunch special. Cashier said there is a $6.99 salad bar and $ 9.99 salad bar.
I said, ok, I would like the $6.99 salad bar.

Cashier said, we don't have a $6.99 salad bar. Only a $9.99 salad bar.

How does that make sense to anyone in charge?

Last time I go to that shady place.< /review><resp>{'time': 1526580835379, 'text': "Christopher, our customers' feedback is very important to us.

Fried chicken from bar is very salty, skin is bordering on rock-hard. Chicken has no flavor. Pasta cooked well past al dente, and sauce is flavorless. Salmon skin still has shards of scales on it, and table is not cleaned well. Would not come back.< /Review>< Pictures>

No other restaurant can get as simple as sizzlers, a family style of coarse. I asked a simple question about a simple sauce on the burger which the employee answered "uhh I don't know burger sauce". I didn't ask to be complicated I asked because I have an allergy and it acts like this that make me rethink about me eating here again.< /review>

I was there 4/30/19. Around 3 it was pretty slow parking lot is decent sized. We ordered steak & shrimp skewers, n upgraded to the bigger steak the shrimp was lil salty, I got also got the strawberry lemonade which pretty good just the right amount of sugar. Steak was decent size n very flavorful waitress was on point n attentive .I gave 4 stars cuz of the salty shrimp,  nice clean place will go back soon. BTW this was the san Pedro location Manchester.< /review>

<review>After standing in line for 20 minutes, my family and I sat down and the table was sticky. We had to wait for 15 minutes more to see our waitress who only said two words to us and didn't even ask if we needed anything. Our drinks were never refilled the whole time we were there and the salad bar was stocked with food that was sitting on a cart in front of the bar. I ordered beef tips which was the "manager special" and let me tell you there was NOTHING special about this crappy food. I ordered mine medium and it came out BURNT! I would suggest going somewhere else!!!< /review>< name>

<review>The quality of meat here has gone down a lot.

I ordered sirloin tips today for lunch.

Presentation was nice, two skewers loaded with meat, resting on a bed of rice. However after removing the wooden skewers there were at least half of the morsels of meat that consisted almost completely of gristle while the remaining pieces also were difficult to eat with slightly less strips of gristle and fat.

I brought this quietly to the attention of my server and she said everyone complains about it.

Is it just me or is something missing?

I saw a new feature upon arriving at the restaurant today, free valet parking! I did self park but am thinking money is being spent here in the wrong places by management.<//review><gmapID>0x80c2b72e4901ef19:0xd67535ed82b9e85e< /gmapID><user_name>Crana Lad< /user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>116366184928098485431< /userid><response>None</response>< Time>

I like getting lunch here. The place is not to crowded so you can get in, sit down for a meal and get going within 30 to 45mins. The waiters/waitresses are very helpful and nice too.<//Text>

Food was okay service sucked( or should I say what service)   had to ask a busboy to get something for me in order to get the service person over and then service person wanted to clean the table while I'm eating (which would have been fine if she had cleaned the table 10 minutes earlier).</Text>

The quality of meat here has gone down a lot.

I ordered sirloin tips today for lunch.

Presentation was nice, two skewers loaded with meat, resting on a bed of rice. However after removing the wooden skewers there were at least half of the morsels of meat that consisted almost completely of gristle while the remaining pieces also were difficult to eat with slightly less strips of gristle and fat.

I brought this quietly to the attention of my server and she said everyone complains about it.

Is it just me or is something missing?

I saw a new feature upon arriving at the restaurant today, free valet parking! I did self park but am thinking money is being spent here in the wrong places by management.<//text>

Worst sizzler ever. It should close down it's that bad. The staff are extremely rude, the food was stale or soggy and there was a grease smell that came from the kitchen. Outside there are homeless people, stray cats and cockroaches. I was completely shocked at the poor condition of what I remember being a great restaurant.< /text>

<Text>Terrible dining experience on Friday evening April 17, 2015.  My Italian grilled chicken breast was very small and like eating shoe leather.  I asked for a refill on my iced tea a total of 3 times and never got a refill even though I was assured one was coming each time.   I finally just left.< /Text>< pics>

The service here is just not good at all. You have to search for the waiter just to get a refill on your water. Food was not hot and the day was disastrous.</Review>

I was under the impression that Sizzler had gone bankrupt in '89 and closed up shop everywhere soon after...until I moved back to CA and tasted truth for the first time in twenty years.

The ribs were dripping off the bone and melting in my mouth inbetween endless trips back and forth from the salad bar of wonder centerpieceing the restaurant.  The folks at Sizzler don't mind if you're feeding a party of three with only one 'AYCE'  salad bar purchase so don't feel bad that they do when you do.  This is Inglewood, right up the street from 'Randy's Doughnuts'  and 'Roscoes Chicken and Waffles' ; do you really think they care about how much salad you walk away with.
