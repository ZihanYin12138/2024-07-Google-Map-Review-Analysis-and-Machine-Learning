<Review>Sports addicts is the only place I go to for my sports gear not only for me but for my family as well too. They have such a great selection and great pricing as well!  With the times I’ve come in as well it’s great talking with Mike (the owner) about Angels baseball too!< /Review>< gmap_id>

<review>Sports Addict is a fantastic treasure of a store. I’ve never been inside however my on-line orders have been handled with care and professionalism. Unlike most retailers, Mike Gaspar, has been totally responsive to questions and my communication with the store has been excellent.
I recommend this company for all team related goods. My purchases have been college football and pro football.< /review>< time>

<review>My son (new card collector) went in and visited Mike yesterday, he couldn't have been more helpful. He gave us great advice, showed us as many cards as we wanted to look at, and even gave my boy some free cards to start his collection. He was so excited and we are going to be loyal customers to the Sport Addict. Great service, excellent selection, and a little bit of everything for the collector or fan!!< /review>< user_id>

I was looking for a certain hat the Raiders sugar skull hat in a 7 5/8 it was out of stock but when it came back in stock Mike made sure to email right away and let me know. I ordered and received it in a few days. Mike went above and beyond with his customer service. Thanks Mike for taking care of me. I will definitely be ordering more things from his store</text>

< Review>
Ordered a Hall of Fame NBA Jersey via online. Hours later was alerted by management that the size I selected was out of stock, but I was offered options including a full refund to fix the matter. I informed management that the next size up would be fine. Management assured me they would take care of everything. From Cali to Florida my package arrived a few days later perfect. Authentic sports memorabilia & great service.< /Review>

Happy with the variety of styles for my teams. They were out of the specific style of hat I wanted so I ordered it online so I could have it as soon as it came in.  During COVID, this is a happy contrast to the local chain stores.
Owner knows his stuff too, so it's great to talk sports with him. Will always go to Sports Addict first when buying memorabilia and/or team gear.< /Review>

Awesome place to go to and huge amount of local teams. But prices are just way to high. With fanatics and all the other online places it is just not worth going here. I saw a bunch of stuff that I wanted but I just didn’t want to spend a fortune on that stuff. Very disappointing...< /text>

He made sure I got my package the next day after I messaged him (7/15). Really happy with this company. Very friendly and attentive staff!<//review>< Resp>

Hi! I called Mike from Texas where I had recently moved from CA and he was so helpful. I sent a Laker 2020 ring tshirt to my son, Cody, for his birthday. Arrived in Murietta, California in four days. Great service, a really helpful owner and the store has so many great sports related items. Highly recommend it!

Sports Addict is now my favorite spot for ordering sports apparel. I love this store! I am 3,000 miles away yet I found this store online, and ordered merchandise that was fulfilled on a timely basis. Very impressive! When a question arose about my particular order, Mike immediately contacted me via email to clarify & my merch was on its way. If you want a reputable online vendor, priced right, with quick customer service & shipping turnaround, please look no further! Thanks Mike! And keep up the great work! I would highly recommend ordering from Sports Apparel!<//Text>

<Review>This is a awesome sports store for anyone who is a Sports Fan. There is a wide variety of things for any sports fan. Mike is a great, professional person and will go out of his way to make you satisfied. If you are looking for sports items for yourself or as a gift, then come here. It is the best place in Orange County.<//Review>< Name>

There is a true commitment to customer service and satisfaction here. Through the text chat option, on Christmas, the owner was gracious enough to open the doors for me on a last minute gift for my nephew. He was able to point out ideas. He will continue to have my business. Thank you sir and Happy Holidays!!!</Text>

<text>I found Sports Addict by accident while searching for some Kansas City Chiefs hats on 09/09/19 and decided to inquire about the availability of the items since I couldn't find them anywhere else. After my email was replied to less than an hour-and-a-half after I sent it, I went ahead and ordered the items. Mike always responded to my questions and concerns in a very timely manner and I couldn't be happier with the service that I received. As a result, I plan to order more items from them in the future.

Sincerely,

Michael Logan<//text>< Pics>

Stopped by this place a few weeks a ago to pick up some items for my nephews birthday. The questions I had were answered with a level of professionalism rarely found now a days in retail. I initially went in to purchase 1 maybe 2 items, but soon I realized I'm leaving the store a few bucks shy of $100, but it was worth it. The gentleman even went out of his way to throw in some cases that surprised me, you rarely see that happen now a days, Not only that, he even thru in a few packs of basketball cards for my little nephew who had the "best birthday ever" his words. I know where I'll be doing all future purchases from here on out. Thank you Sport's Addict.<//text>

Guy's I can't tell you how disappointed I am with your customer service. I have called numerous times always getting a recording, left messages not returned, emailed only to receive an occasional reply with excuses and on top of that you used Kobe's death as an excuse why you can't provide a tracking number. How sad, have you guys heard of Fanatic's ?
I guess they must not get the orders you do, I got my order from them in less than a week.

What ticked me off today was that you  CHARGED my credit card for a transaction that you didn't ship. My guess is you never had the inventory, well I filed a complaint with about anyone I could think of.

I suspect you had better save yourself and issue a credit before this situation gets out of hand.

I gave one star because I had to for this review to post.

UPDATE:  The owner finally reached out and within a week I had my order Note it worked out for me this time - just be careful when buying on line< /review><Name>Harvey Townley< /Name></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Purchased a mug from the website.  Recieved a confirmation email with the photo of the correct mug I ordered.  The day the mug was to arrive I received an update that the mug was to be delivered that day but with a different mug pictured.

I was sent the wrong mug.  When I went back to the website they simply swapped the photo and kept the description of the mug I ordered probably hoping I wouldn't notice.  The mug I ordered is in a similar style of 4 other sports teams mug I own.  So I know the difference.  After attempting to email with photos of their mistake and trying to call them...  They have not replied or tried to call me back

NEVER shopping from them again.</Review>< Pics>

I ordered a Baltimore Orioles 2014 Majestic Hooded Sweatshirt on October 2, 2014. My account was charged on October 6 for this purchase. My status was not reflecting the order so I contacted Mike. I must also say I paid $13.75 for priority delivery. Mike contacted me with an email the next day to say he was pulling the item from the warehouse and would update my status. That is the last thing I have heard form them and I have emailed them daily since October 8, 2014. I have also called their customer service number every day as well and have yet to get a response. It is now October 15, 2014 and I am very frustrated. All I am asking is for a response that either you are sending my sweatshirt or that you will refund my money. A very poor way to do business and totally unacceptable. I read the reviews before ordering and felt that Mike had a family run business with a very good reputation. I am very disappointed in how this has turned out and it looks like by the time I get my Orioles sweatshirt they will have been eliminated from the playoffs. Mike, please do the right thing and send my sweatshirt as you are still advertising them as being in stock on your website.<//text>

The store has every sports team you are looking for, and if they don’t then the Sports Addict website sure does. The store owner is extremely friendly and helpful and can get you what you want.  The card night events are very fun and I always look forward to those.  10/10 would shop!<//Text>

Mike has been absolutely amazing at keeping me updated about my sons hat I ordered! I wasn’t aware the hat was pre-ordered so I reached out to see what was taking so long- totally my fault and he was quick to respond and not to forget about updating me when the item finally arrived for shipment!  Great customer service 💛</Review>

Great customer service! Ordered an extremely hard to find shirt for my boyfriend which Sports Addict had 1 in stock. I received it with a broken button. I emailed them knowing I could not get a new shirt before Christmas because they didn’t have any left nor did anyone in the country!! They immediately sent me the button to fix the shirt.</Review>

I ordered an item for Christmas 12/20/2016
I paid the extra to have it arrive before Christmas, I received a conformation and I did not hear anything for a day or two, so I tryed to call. I left 2 messages -never received a call back.
So I decided to send an email nothing!!!
I probably should have read the reviews before I placed an order with them....

<Review>I am very disappointed with this site.  The communication is awful.  I ordered something on 12/12/14 and I still haven't received my item (1/23/15).  I have emailed this place numerous times and have called twice.  I called during their "business hours" and no one picks up the phone, straight to voicemail.  I wish I would have read the other reviews for this site because I never would have ordered from there.  I feel the pain of the other customers who did not receive or took forever and a day to get their items.  There is nothing on the site about how long delivery takes, which makes sense because they probably don't want people to know it takes forever.  They send you an email about your order number and tracking information, but there is no where to track the package.  I am really angry and am going to demand for my money back.  Please be aware of ordering anything from this site.  I will never order anything from here again, and will tell anyone I know about how bad this site is.  It truly is not a business worth trusting.<//Review><Time>1422045234119< /Time><rating>1</rating>< pictures>

This shop is right around the corner. The staff is always helpful and friendly.  My husband and I are fans of East coast sports team and are always able to find something for us.

From reading other reviews it appears they've had a lot of issues with their online side. I've never used that service so I can't comment on that.</Text>

THE WORST!  I ordered a t shirt for a football game I was going to Nov. 2nd. He says no prob I'll ship it to you. Nov 2nd comes and goes...no t shirt.  The following week I call twice and leave a message...no response...a week after that I go into his store and he first tells me he didn't call me back because he got a new phone system...well you receive messages, why didn't you call me back? No response! Then he looks up the item and says it looks like it went back to the warehouse because it couldn't be delivered because you moved...uhhh no I haven't, but I don't need the t shirt anymore so please reimburse me for my shirt...Mike: well that will take a couple of days. Me: Why? Mike: because maybe you received it and you just don't want to pay for it? WHAT??? You just said it went back to the warehouse! So you have a shirt I paid for and you want to sell it again?? This guy is a piece of work!! ZERO in customer service...cannot believe he said that I may have received it and didn't want to pay for it!! I would stay as far away as possible from this guy and his store!!!</Text>

I would give no stars if possible. I ordered overnight delivery, did not receive for two weeks, then it was the wrong order, still waiting for replacement.< /Review>

Same story as all other recent reviews.  Ordered a few winter hats for my kids January 11th, paid priority shipping and as of Feb 6th have not received or heard anything from these guys.  Have placed a few calls during business hours and received the automated voicemail, but yet to receive a call back.   Hoping they will follow through and ship them out before the snow melts in MN.</Text>

<text>Went in to see Franklin Harvey. Paid $260 for the AAA membership and my first month on a policy for one of my two cars. (We were going to add my second car the next day) Nearly a week later, He calls me back and tells me that they are unable to cover my vehicle because it's registered under my father's name. (Thanks for letting me know AFTER you've taken my money for a week) So we cancel the policy... It's now been TEN + days since I cancelled my policies and I have still not received my refund. I call AGAIN, he no longer works at that office. The gal who tried helping me instead said they just issued my refund 2 days ago (when I was supposed to have RECEIVED my refund) and guess what. It's $141 SHORT of what I paid. AAA, you are horrible. You are so lucky I paid you in CASH. Had this been a card transaction, you wouldn't have been able to rob me. THIEVES. I had to take money out of my rent to put even more money down for another policy with Farmers Insurance while I wait for my refund from AAA. BAD BUSINESS.

< Review>
How convenient is the tripple A in Hilltop?  Very, cause a DMV is inside for registration service to it's members. Well worth it even if the price for insurance is little more that other insurance company.
Update 11/22: They have located and I almost hated them for it.  Only because they only had a small memo of notification of their move across town on their old building front door. I'm over it now and I still like how convenient they are, to me.</Review>

Great fast service, well the woman that sits in the middle. At the little lower desk where you can renew or do any DMV transactions, is a fast worker, courteous and accurate.</text>

NO STARS!!!!! But I put one for this to be posted. I have waited 12 weeks for my plates and was supposed to be contacted. I tried calling the branch and was sent to the call center who told me that the branch was not taking calls, and to drive up there to get help. WHAT?????  Then when I asked for a Supervisor ,, i was transferred all around the system. I finally got a nice young man who went out of his was to help me and I was able to speak to a Supervisor in the call center. Though my issue was not solved. It's hit and miss with AAA.<//text>

First AAA office I've been to where they didn't have a person at the maps/tour book desk, just a sign in sheet.  I just stopped in about 4:45 to get a map of the area (no map machine) and there were 4 other people waiting.  Waited for about 5 minutes but when one came around, didn't look like anyone was gong to be coming around and no employees would make eye contact I gave up and left.< /text>

If you're not a AAA member I have a question for you why not you get road service when you need it which is like insurance it's not necessary but if you ever need it look at the bill on your tow truck it'll pay for the full year of Service Plus anytime you need to renew or register a vehicle you can go into AAA and beat the 2 hour wait at the DMV well worth it< /Review>

A top notch agency such as AAA should anwer their phone's. Customer's pay the premium price to have outstanding service and unfortunately for this office they lack that professional aproach. I refuse to waste my time to leave a messege and wait for a call.
Looks like from previous comments that this issue has been ongoing so maybe they don't care... Needless to say I'll be taking my money somewhere else.< /Review>

This review is for AAA Travel. I received great service during the inquiry and booking process for our cruise to Alaska, but sadly service went drastically downhill, conveniently once we had fully paid and it was non-refundable, so beware! My family has been AAA members for over 40 years, and used AAA Travel for many years, but I'd rather book all my cruises and other travel online or with another agency than use AAA Travel going forward!

We were looking to book a cruise to Alaska, so I researched online and found AAA Travel which had competitive rates with extras such as additional onboard credits and a bottle of champagne for each cabin. I called and was put in touch with their travel counselor, Amber Smith, in the Richmond-Hilltop office. It started out great. She was very nice, prompt in answering all my questions, and providing various quotes, which led to booking our reservation.

Everything was going great, until she made a mistake by forgetting to pay our final payment and our booking was canceled as a result! When she realized her mistake, she reassured me she fixed everything and was able to rebook us to the way it was before, which to me meant same cabin, same fare, onboard credits, etc. However, to my disappointment, once we made our final payment and received the final confirmation, everything had changed- our cabins, our dining time, increase in fare, and we lost $50 per cabin in onboard credits!

All of a sudden she became less responsive to my emails and phone calls, and she kept giving me the run around. If she had simply acknowledged her mistake (she tried to blame me initially saying that I didn't notify her, but I have an email proving I did), sincerely apologized, and made it a priority to fix it, but was unsuccessful, I might have let it go. Instead, all I got was one excuse after another, placing blame on what seemed like one thing after another. The branch manager, Paul Mulig, overheard my heated tone and our discussion when I paid her a visit in person and tried to assure me that he would try to help her to get this resolved. It started looking promising, but unfortunately it ended up being no help. Just before our cruise, Amber claimed to have fixed it, by purchasing a gift certificate or onboard credit of some sort for us to use on board the cruise, but at the same time she was being extremely vague and unclear as to how or when we would get it.

To no surprise, when we got on board, we saw no sign of that gift certificate nor any additional onboard credits. The extra bottle of wine she also promised us was nowhere to be seen. She then blamed her rep at Royal Caribbean. If we did believe her, then her rep has definitely made her look bad. If I were her, I would have escalated the issue at Royal Caribbean, but judging from her actions up to this point, she didn't seem to try at all for us. Although Amber is a very nice person, as a "experienced" travel counselor she never showed she was proactive, never did any follow up without me asking her to, and never gave me a sense of any priority or urgency on making this right.

Now it is over 3 months since we've come back from our cruise and still no resolution! I have not received any follow up or update from Amber or Paul. Unbelievable. I've worked in client services for a CPA firm for many years as a successful accountant and business consultant. I was always assigned the high profile clients, because I was one of the best at providing customer service. Whenever I made a mistake, it would be one of my top priorities to work on it until I got the issue resolved, and never hesitated to escalate any issues with any 3rd parties. No excuses. Period.

I am deeply disappointed with this experience, as there is NO excuse for any of this to dragged out this long. I will never use Amber and AAA Travel again!< /Text>

Been wanting to go for over 2 months, finally got a chance. The wait was worth it, the churros were freshly made to order, very crispy on the outside, but soft and chewy on the inside. They had variety and you could also create your own. Paired with ice cream is definitely the best, the warm crunchy churro with the cold ice cream was perfect. Highly recommend and will definitely be going back again.</Review>

<text>This place was recommended to us by friend Laid back relax atmosphere, the staff are friendly and have a good knowledge of their products. There is a wide selection of gluten free sandwiches and salads The cheese sandwiches are amazing!I mark on the careful side so if I give a good review then it's well deserved. Friendly service, great location, quirky interior.< /text><Name>Stinky Crook</Name>< user>

God I love this place. The staff is so friendly you can't help but smile along with them. I always go in for my usual large iced chai tea latte and a churro. The ambiance the place creates is one of peace and tranquility. If I needed to write a paper that's definitely the place I'd hit up because of the atmosphere.< /text>

Very nice staff. I go for the breakfast bagel. Only served until 10:30. Taste great. My wife said the caramel frappé is the best she ever had. Better than Starbucks and more inviting. Parking is behind building.</Review>

They don't accept American Express. Don't understand their mindset. They're losing more on lost business especially from corporate customers than the transaction fees that they're afraid of. Good quality drinks but just lost another business traveler customer...</Text>

Only ordered an original churro. It was average at best, a little overdone/dry. With churro in the name I'd expect a little bit more but it tastes like a gentrified type place would make churro taste.  They should offer some cream filled churros or something.<//review>

Coffee definitely had milk in it when I ordered without :/  Didn't have much of a coffee flavor either which was disappointing given that was what I ordered.<//Text>

<text>A friend and I came here after noticing the grand opening sign. It is located right next to the Norwalk amc.

The ambiance is great in here. Lots of open tables and large windows with outlets at every table. Super great for studying - especially considering the free wifi.

I had a warmed banana nut muffin - it was fresh and delicious.

I also ordered a skinny vanilla latte and had it made extra hot. Perfect.

It was fairly empty on the Sunday I went, so my friend and I sat for a few hours with our computers and got work done.

Definitely a great and recommended study and coffee spot!</text>< rating>

SixPax is an awesome gym with a strong sense of community. I joined with the intention of gaining muscle and I’ve been seeing measurable results. All the trainers are very friendly and knowledgeable, know you by name, and will tailor your workout to push you based on where you’re at. I’m so glad I joined and plan to stay for a long time!<//review>

<Review>SixPax Gym an awesome gym and by far the best facility around. Siavash and Team are amazing and offer tons of support and encouragement on my fitness journey. All the trainers are really nice and are interested in you regardless of your fitness level. I really like how they give me tips and tricks to make the most of each practice session. I have been going for a while and I already see a big change lost 30 Lbs. in 3 months. Love this place! If you want to lose weight and get fit SixPax Gym is a place.</Review>< Pics>

Getting to a better physical form is easy - you do the hard work and keep doing it. Huge thanks to Siavash et al. at SixPax Gym. They are professionals who push you to your mental and physical limit safely, while providing very helpful guidelines on how to keep your body at its best. I am very satisfied with the outcome so far, and will definitely recommend this gym to anyone who is seriously thinking about shedding fat and growing some muscles.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>This place has been a life saver to shed shut down pounds. Siavash is an intrepid small business owner who invests in the community. The workouts are hard, but efficient bang for your buck (you can crush it for 30 minutes): the trainers know how much to push you for results. There is high-quality equipment like Star Trac treadmills to supplement home cardio. The Hawthorne Effect is real: we change our behaviors when someone is watching. Worth the investment.< /Text>< user_name>

This is a wonderful outdoor gym with caring trainers. We are lucky to have this gym locally. The Owner is a lovely inspiring man to our community here in Culver City. I am grateful to have him and his team helping my family to achieve our health goals.</review>

Gym is really nice and they're the only gym that has their own custom water bottles :D Me and my gf tried their free pass as I came to visit in the City because I stay in San Jose, Ca. Melanie, one of the employees was really helpful and genuine. Joey who is their fitness director was a really cool dude! The gym makes you feel welcome. They have plenty of equipment, tires, box jumps etc. Definitely a training facility I would join if I lived in SF<//Text>

Pros: enough floor space to do your workouts. two pools, one warm one cooler. coffee in the morning. friendly front desk folks. some good classes. i once needed to take out my laptop to do some work asap and was pleasantly surprised that the wifi was good enough to do so with ease. :) glad they now do mobile check-in and you don't need your access card to use a locker.</Text>

<Review>Best gym/fitness studio I've ever been to! This is one of few places that makes me feel a little like I'm back in the varsity weight room or conditioning workouts in college - working hard and smart along side a team with quality, knowledgeable and motivating coaches. Nate and Thomas have done an amazing job establishing a genuine and welcoming community. Workouts are fun, varied, effective and can be tweaked based on ability and fitness. They also follow a program that is great for members but also works well for those who come occasionally. Another great thing about P13 is the diversity (including age range and gender balance) - the crowd here is definitely more diverse than what I see at most other studios and I think it's indicative of the inclusive community here. I can go on with the many other great things but you just have to give it a try yourself! Only con is it's not closer to my house :)< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><user_id>100918483528158633223< /user_id>< GmapID>

Joining SixPax Gym has been the best choice I have made towards reaching my health goals. The group training sessions have far exceeded my expectations in regards to return on investment. I have been pleasantly surprised by how engaged Siavash’s and Peri’s routines have made me in working to improve my overall health. After my free session, I had no reservations in signing up for a monthly subscription to SixPax Gym. I have worked with personal trainers one on one in the past, and I can confidently say that SixPax Gym has provided me with personal trainer level service at a fraction of the cost. I highly recommend SixPax Gym to anyone looking to improve their health, mental or physical.< /review>

This is an amazing gym with amazing coaches. I’m on my second trimester and feel so comfortable working out with their training & knowledge. It’s an effective gym as well as an open gym which works amazing with today’s world. My husband is who recommended me here and seeing his results of loosing over 70 pounds I couldn’t wait to join and have my own experience with SixPax. Couldn’t be happier!<//Review>

Absolutely love this gym. More to the point: they offer great classes. I can't get enough of Gina Guaiumi's Total Body Workout. Gina knows how to target under-worked or underused body parts in a way that I wouldn't know how to do on my own on the gym floor. She's really in tune to which muscles are being worked, and she offers great alternatives if: the movement is too difficult; or, you have an injury.< /text>

<review>The trainers evaluate the strengths and weaknesses during the initial visit. They want to know what your goals are and they plan your workouts to assist you with you goal. This is a very friendly and professional gym. I have two son's who have been working out at SixPax Gym for two years and they enjoy it and are motivated to succeed because of the positive relationships built with the instructors. Great Place!

The team of trainers here, led by Siavash, are all incredibly motivating, friendly, good at matching the intensity to what you are capable of, while still pushing you far above your comfort zone.
I have never looked forward to working out as much as I do here.
This gym is a great community and shows great results.</Review>

Joined this gym for 1 month because I really needed to clear my mind and loose a bit of covid weight . But mainly I needed to clear my mind out of everything going on and six pack gym honestly helped me out in every way . This is a great place to workout and the staff our very helpful . The owner is very nice and gives you advise on your workouts and motivates you to continue going and to reach your goals. I would definitely recommend to try it out.<//Text>

<text>I needed to do something. But I can never do it on my own because I cop out of exercises too easily. I’ve driven by this location many times and finally decided to check them out.

It’s outside in the open which is great for the current Covid action. Everyone wears masks, everything is sanitized after each session. I’ve joined for two sessions a week. In a month’s time now, just two times a week and following their food recommendations about 90%, there’s already a noticeable difference in my physique. I’m starting to tone up, I am much stronger than I was before and more importantly, I’m starting to feel confident and good about myself again. It’s a month-to-month basis so it’s no 2 year sign up/commitment like most gyms which is great. And it’s not crossfit...no offense.

A 1/2 hour two times a week really does work. It’s kind of crazy. The staff is wonderful, they adjust to your needs and will push you but not more than you can handle. I’m hoping with another month under my belt, I can increase to 3x a week.

Trust me, I hate working out...but I actually look forward to my sessions. Highly recommended!!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1600842719692, 'text': 'Appreciate you time in giving us this great reviews! Thanks Angela, much appreciated.'}< /response>< gmap_id>

Their packages includes training sessions, unlimited aerobics equipment usage and a diet plan tailored to each individual. Siavash, the owner and main trainer is intense, honest and old-school. Every trainer I have trained with there are very kind, knowledgeable and friendly. About pandemic safety - everyone wears masks, they take special care to wipe down equipments after each training session, sometimes even in between sessions, and all classes happen outdoors with sufficient space between the members.
I have been going to Sixpax to shed some of the pandemic pounds that have accumulated and as promised the results are starting to show within weeks.< /Review><username>Tittu Thomas< /username><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba166eb67bfd:0x3d7e88ffc43c03e6</Gmap_id><date>1608401988723</date><Rate>5</Rate>< Response>

I just recently joined SixPax gym and I can say 100% it’s nothing like anything I’ve done before. I was pretty nervous at first since I had not worked out in a few months if it would be too intense, but they do small sessions of 30 mins and you get a great training session in that is tailored to where your fitness level is.

It’s a great place to pop in with plenty of parking, all of the trainers are so welcoming, friendly, and attentive. It’s truly the best spot to start or continue training!</review>

<text>I came to sixpax gym with the mindset of being there for a month just to get my body in shape for my sport. After the first month I fell in love with the workouts, the environment, the positivity, and the motivation that came with working out at sixpax. These workouts push me to my limit however, the results and the encouragement I receive from all the staff members, especially Siavash make my time there something I look forward to as opposed to resent!<//text>< pictures>

This past month with SixPax Gym has been remarkable! Prior to joining SixPax Gym, I was constantly feeling tired, I wasn’t eating well/enough and I just had no motivation. But after joining this awesome gym, I have received good, quality and professional training from Mr. Siavash, Peri and Mr. Peters. I appreciate their attention which is given to each person training. I feel challenged and motivated to keep pushing through the wobbly legs and arms! 💪🏼🙂🤘🏼

The meal plans have also been super important to my progress in the past month. Even though I have a mostly plant based diet, I think SixPax Gym has taken great consideration into people’s dietary needs and limitations.

Definitely looking forward to the next few months!</review>

I love this gym.

My fiancé referred me to this gym and I love it! I’ve only been a member for a few weeks but the results are real!

Siavash has a great personality and is a very thorough and knowledgeable trainer. He’s helped me maintain realistic goals and makes the process so much easier. Perry is also really great!

At first I was skeptical about the session length and frequency as well as the amount of money the monthly membership costs but it’s SO worth it. No nonsense, direct approach. The diet/meal plan I was given is also realistic and super easy to follow. I don’t feel starved or go crazy counting calories or anything like that. I also love that I can still enjoy flavorful foods unlike with some other plans I’ve attempted.

Overall joining this gym has been a great lifestyle choice that I am confident I can maintain.</text>

<Text>I love SixPax gym.  It has helped me tremendously in achieving my overall fitness goal.  I build a lot of lean muscle over the past 3 months after taking  time off with the gym closures during Covid.  Sixpax always knows how to whip me into shape.  I’m excited  and thankful for the  results I’ve achieved thus far.  Siavash & Peri are always encouraging, positive and  know when to give  you that extra push when you need it most.  They’re always so accommodating and super flexible with their schedule.  I absolutely recommend them to anyone wanting to get in shape.</Text>< Name>

Going to SixPax has been one of the highlights of my exercise routine. Siavash and Peri are professional, strong, kind and above all know what works for you. Individually. Everyone has a different body and strength, it’s not a one size fits all formula. They push you hard if your are lifting 12 pounds or 100,  the training has been consistent and challenging since my first day. The strength you build with time is transformative. Hitting that tire makes my day!! Thank you guys for everything you do and for taking care of me.  xxxx<//review>

<Text>SixPax gym has gone above and beyond during these uncertain times. From sanitizing the equipment on a regular basis  to moving the gym outside so we can train. I’ve been attending the gym for 2 months sticking to the diet, doing cardio, and since the first month I could already see visible results! I have Siavash  and the coaching staff to thank for my great results!

The level of commitment Siavash & all trainers have for their clients is unparalleled to any other gym or level of personal training in the greater LA area. The workout regimen and diet is fail proof and will yield you AMAZING results as long as you put the work in. I have been a client for the last 2 months and have seen DRAMATIC results following the game plan put forth for me.... Get SERIOUS and get with SIXPAX to change your life, health & fitness for the better....<//review>

SixPax Gym changes lives, I know first hand. Siavash is an extremely genuine and kind person that motivates and inspires each individual that is luckily enough to train under his tutelage.

This gym feels more like a family  and I couldn’t be more thankful than to be included. If you are serious about making a change, there is no other place to go.

I only wish I had started training here sooner.<//review>

<text>The small group (semi-private) training sessions at SixPax are great! You will work harder, push harder and perform better because of the great motivation provided.

The 2nd round of gym closures due to COVID-19 really had me down. However, the very next day after indoor facilities were ordered to shut their doors [again], I happened to drive by SixPax and saw that they had moved their equipment outside - to the parking lot. I decided to stop by, to try out the workout, and I enjoyed it so much, that I ended up signing up immediately afterwards. After 3 weeks, I can definitely notice progress!<//text></record>

Siavash is wonderful. He takes what he does very seriously and he always encourages me to do my best. I’ve never worked with a trainer before for a multitude of reasons but working with him has truly been life changing. So happy that I found him.<//Text>

<Text>I had been going to a gym for about two years prior to joining Six Pax Gym. I have learned and achieved more in the one month training with Siavash, Mr. Perry, and Mr. Peter than I have in those two years with my old gym. The trainers here will push you hard to the point where you feel yourself breaking boundaries which you set for yourself. I have grown athletically, and mentally here and I don’t plan on changing trainers anytime soon. GET TO SIX PAX GYM TODAY!!!!!!!!!!!< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Review>Since joining SixPax Gym about a year ago I’ve seen great progress & changes in my body. They will give you the tools you need like a meal plan to follow along with your weight training sessions within an intimate setting where you won’t feel intimidated, very few gyms does that. I highly recommend this gym.< /Review></record>

<review>I’ve trained at several gyms across the west side and Six Pax is by far my favorite. The best thing about them is that it’s an honest, old school workout. Free weights mostly. You get what you put into it. Siavash and Peri know what they are doing, training wise, and they push you. They also know how to individualize the workout to get the best out of you. Since reopening after the Covid lockdown, they have been adhering to the strictest safety measures. I cannot recommend then highly enough.<//review><username>Man of Steele Productions<//username></record>

Quit farting around and get up. Move. Lift something. If you lift one single rep and THATS IT... Come back and lift it twice. Just eat what Siavash says to eat, lift what he says to lift. Keep It Simple Stupid! Coaches Siavash, Peri, and Peter know whats up!<//text>

<review>I finally found the gym that offers great workout and great motivation. It has been 3 weeks since I joined sixpax gym .. I lost 20 pounds which was so hard for me to even lose 5 pounds on my own.. I just see the inches and pounds are shedding off my body . I couldn't have done it with out the motivation I found with Siavash and the owesome trainers there . The gym has some great equipments needed to have both cardio and weight lifting workout.. Big thank you to everyone. I appreciate your hard work.<//review>< pictures>

As a working professional with not a lot of time, I was looking for a trainer that would give me maximum results within the shortest amount of time. SixPax Gym has that!  Siavash (the owner) and other trainers really push you hard for 30min and you walk away knowing your body just got taken a little further then you thought it ever could and it feels GREAT!< /Text>

The owner was more than welcoming and allowed me to even try out the equipment and get a workout in.  I have an extensive background in the health and fitness industry, and was pleasantly surprised by coming across this place. The quality of a gym is not measured by physical size, rather by equipment choice/quality, management and trainers. This gym packs ALL the right equipment necessary to take on people from beginners right through to top athletes, the owner is extremely friendly with a list of credentials and an obvious passion for health and fitness. A place like this is more than you could ever ask for if you are really looking to see some results with your training. A+<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

I kinda don’t want to write this because this gym is such a gem and I’d like to keep it a secret.

This place is wonderful - Siavash knows his stuff (he’s a bodybuilder) and is friendly and helpful. Peri is also awesome and the classes really work - they’re simple and hard - in a good way.

Come to Sixpax if you want to change your body and your life. The cost is worth every penny and more.</review>

<text>SixPax Gym is by far the best gym for people who are serious about getting in shape, and don’t want the typical gym atmosphere that intimidates or shuns those just starting out. The people there are supportive and Siavash is encouraging and helpful. I would recommend that anyone that wants to really see results and have fun while getting them should join here! You won’t be disappointed! I’m only 2 months in and I’m already feeling amazing.< /text><time>1560373769698</time><pics>None</pics>< userid>

Great experience at Sixpax with Siavash and his team.  Not only for the training plan, but also the food plan that helps me to learn. Building muscle and losing body fat is not an easy process, they are always willing to teach, motivate and and inspire.  Best gym I’ve ever found! Thanks!</text>

Fantastic gym. I was definitely a little intimidated walking into the gym for the first time, 30 lbs. overweight, and without truly being able to do a single sincere push up. But Siavash and Peri are great, really work with you from wherever you're at ability-wise and encourage you to work hard and reap the benefits. With the twice a week training sessions, and the nutrition plan they laid out I've lost over 25 lbs. in about 6 weeks, gained muscle and strength, and feel better than I've felt in decades. Everyone is really positive and it definitely feels like a community. I just wish I hadn't spent two years driving past it before finally deciding to go in.<//Text>

<Text>SixPax is by far the best overall experience I have had with a gym or trainer. The environment at SixPax is so friendly and supportive, no matter who you work out with or what time of day it is. Very small sessions assure that you are getting both the help and motivation you need to push you through your work out. Maybe you have checked out the website and seen that sessions are only 30 minutes... yes, I too was skeptical because I found myself at the gym for 2/3 hours when I worked out by myself; however, these 30 minute workouts are by far the most difficult and challenging workouts I have ever done. I’m so happy I found this gem of gym and I recommend it to everyone that is serious about reaching their fitness goals. Siavash will whip you into shape in no time and he is always there to guide and support you!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>The investment you make when you come to SixPax  is your time, effort, and mentality. Siavash (owner) and Peri (right hand man) invest even more back into each individual to reach their goals. This gym has the grit, no BS/no excuse attitude that I needed to get myself to another level both mentally and physically. I am someone who has a day to day that is stressful and many people relying on me, so it is nice to have a place to be able to focus and have support from leaders who are extremely knowledgeable and push you to be your best self. I’ve never seen someone walk out angry or upset, only sweating or wobbling with a smile on their face because they no they couldn’t make excuses to not push!!! Follow the workout plan and diet and you won’t regret making this gym a part of your routine!!</review><Rating>5< /Rating><Response>None<//Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba166eb67bfd:0x3d7e88ffc43c03e6<//Gmap_id><Time>1572486863108< /Time><username>Ryan Jancula<//username></record></dataset><record>

This is a great gym.  They personalize everything for you so you don't have to think, just workout hard.  The results come fast and they are extremely supportive.  I look forward to every workout (even though they are hard!) and you will too, if you really want to get in shape.< /review>

<text>I drove past SixPax Gym countless times and wish i would have stopped in sooner than I finally did. Siavash and Peri have kept their promise to get me in shape. In such a short amount of time at 2 times a week I feel so much better, fit in my clothes better and am more confident!
Who would have thought that 30 min sessions could make such a difference.  Highly recommend SixPax if you want to feel better,  healthier/in shape and not feel insecure while reaching your goals!</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>SixPax Gym is a life changer! It’s a great, supportive environment in which I can have fun while tapping into the best version of myself. The excellent training sessions by Siavash will have you seeing results in a week! I’m always motivated & sore at SixPax Gym so don’t expect anything less than the best here! You’ll sweat so much , it actually helps hide your tears.
Highly recommend becoming a part of the SixPax family sooner than later !<//review><Name>Mars Bravo< /Name>< date>

Starting fifth week of training - it’s awesome.  One half hour twice weekly plus cardio five days a week.  I’m down five pounds and body fat down 8 percent.  I feel strong and my clothes are fitting great.  Down one size.  Yeah!  Small gym, big results is right!  I love it!<//Review>

Siavash and Peri are amazing! I had been steadily gaining weight and decided to do something about it. I was a little weary at first since it’s only a 30 minute workout but it’s the hardest 30 minutes I’ve ever done and most of al it works. 3 months in and I’m down 25 pounds! So far so good! I highly recommend!<//Review>

Over time, I've noticed a significant improvement in my overall health and fitness.  They emphasizing maxing out your reps rather than lifting heavy weights, so it's easy on my joints.

<text>If you are looking to lose weight and need someone there to encourage you along the way - then SixPax Gym is the place for you. The coaches are very intentional and give much needed encouragement.  I’ve had the privilege of working with the Owner Sia and Coach Luis and trust me they will keep you focused and motivate you every step of the way. I’ve only been training with them for a few weeks but I’ve lost 7 pounds and made significant lifestyle changes. SixPax isn’t like the other gyms with the over zealous jock that seeks attention with all the groans (no shade intended). It’s about positive vibes, teamwork, and comradery. Wherever you are in your fitness journey you can still use the support that the SixPac gym provides. Check them out you’ll be happy you came.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

George Chien<//name>
<text>SixPax Gym is a private gym set up to achieve success if you put the honest work into it.

For me, George Chien, it has been a blessing.  It all starts from the top with the owner/founder SiaVash who is extremely knowledgeable about not only fitness training but the dieting required to achieve the results.  The attention given to me while I’m at the gym (ensuring proper form while pushing the intensity limits) coupled with constant accountability of the proper diet generated immediate results.   Old eating habits and laziness over two decades was shed in weeks/months.... all done in a no frills, family-like culture.   I’ve never been this dedicated to ensuring I get my daily workout in.  Missing a day at the gym creates high anxiety for me.   Getting to the gym has been a new addiction.  I want to constantly learn and improve.

I highly recommend SixPax Gym if you are serious about getting in proper shape.   It does take the right mentality, the right attitude and right dedication to achieve results.    Once you start this journey, it’s hard to stop.  Reason is because the results are for me to keep.   No one can take that away from me.       I recommend stopping by, there’s really no excuse as they’re open 7 days a week & on most (if not all) holidays.

I’m more than happy to share more details of my experience if anyone wants it.<//text>< date>

Six Pax is a great gym and one of a kind in Los Angeles.  Siavash and his staff has a basic workout system that will  definitely get you in the best shape and more!   His workout has allowed me to maintain my diabetes and has helped me decrease my sugar level and blood pressure.  I support this gym and it has helped me get back on track on a healthier life style.  You work hard here and play hard too.  It only take 30 min and it will change your life in a better way!!</text>

SixPax gym is unlike no other training facility I've ever been a part of.  The vibe is so positive and yet very serious that inspires you to train your hardest and feel like your best!  The owner and founder, Siavash, is a very genuine professional person and trainer that sincerely wants only the best from every member!  I can't say enough good things...< /Review>

Jennifer trained me and she is great in making you to workout hard. I used to try many things on my own but nothing worked. But my friends started saying that they see lots of change in me just in 2 months I joined this place. I'm so proud to see myself in shape like I never expected. Thanks a lot Jennifer . Siavash is great in his way too, he is one great person for motivation. He trained me for few sessions. I definitely recommend this place to everyone who wants to see a different person in them !< /Text>< pics>

<review>I have never in my life felt or looked so good. THANK YOU to SIXPAX GYM!!!
Lost 35LB in 6 months. No gym has made such big difference for me. Other gym’s would look at you as just another person to make money from. At SIX PAX GYM you get the real results. There are no fake people here. Its not about looking good while you workout. Its all about the hard work, sweat and your self. If you are reading this review and you are sitting on a coach not wanting to do anything because you are depressed and lost hope in doing anything give SIXPAX GYM a chance. Here you become part of family as everyone pushes not only themselves but also each other. If you heal your body your mind will follow. Now I know I can accomplish anything! SIAVASH and PERRY - THANK YOU!!!<//review>< Pictures>

First week behind me and I'm feeling good. Had many gym memberships in the past but needed personal training to get me motivated and in shape for bikini season. Yes, we all have our reasons.  :) Love the old school style gym.  No muss no fuss. Come in,  train hard and on with your day.  Got my before pic and will be comparing in six months.  Siavash and Perry are great motivators.  I truly love working out here.<//review>

Siavash and his team is very knowledge, work very hard to help you achieve your goal. I been going to SixPax for last 4 month and lost 30lb. It is very hard to achieve this kind of outcome without any help.
Honestly you have to try them out you will not regret it. This is the best gym in my opinion. You will get lot more for your time and money< /review>

<text>I started training with Sia and Peri in April of this year. Their expertise, guidance and genuine interest provided through my individualized strength training sessions and weight management program have been been amazing and encouraging. The consistent redesigning of my sessions keep me progressing steadily and consistently. I actually look forward to coming in after a stressful day at work.

Sia is my trainer most of the time. He pushes me to achieve my maximum potential. Even when the last two reps are unattainable, he will verbally walk you through to finish the set. It will definitely leave you drenched with sweat and release of endorphin rush.

Give Six Pax Gym a chance!!!!   Make an appointment for a free 30 minute session.  You will definitely make permanent life changes for better health and well being. It is entirely worth the investment.

I am truly honored to write this review.

Thank you,

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>This is going to sound so cliche, but I wake up excited for my workout sessions at SixPax Gym!

I decided to take the plunge and check out SixPax Gym after driving by it numerous times. Siavash (owner/trainer) walked me through the process - yes, it's intense workout/strength training  sessions with Siavash and Peri but they also set you up with a meal/diet plan to help you reach your goal as well as gym equipment readily available to help you complete your daily 45 minutes of cardio.

Siavash reaches out consistently to make sure you stay on track and has proven very helpful whenever I have any  questions regarding my meal plan. I have been with SixPax Gym for a month now and with Siavash and Peri's help, have lost 10 pounds and gained a great workout community.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>BEST Gym I have ever trained at - I have been training at Six Pax Gym for almost a year and it has been a wonderful, rewarding, and phenomenal experience. Siavash is the best personal trainer around - he helped me gained muscle and lose fat. With his help and motivation I competed twice at men's physique competition twice during the last year. Results don't lie - you can see all the before and after pictures on the website.<//Text>< Response>

This gym is great for anyone that is serious about getting in shape.  Siavash has put together a intense but fast 30 minute workout that delivers results.  Siavash and Perry do a great job of mixing up your workout and helping customize a program based on your individual goals.  I highly recommend this gym!<//review>

<review>Previously, the only working out at a gym I had ever done was running on a treadmill. After starting at SixPax Gym, I felt like I joined a family that truly cared about motivating me to be my best. Not only did I start learning how to properly workout, Siavash and his team also provided me with an easy-to-follow nutrition plan designed for me, which happened to save me money on groceries too. In just under 2 months of being at SixPax gym, I'm feeling amazing with the strength I've gained (lifting double the amount of weight), gained confidence with being inside a gym (because I now know how to work out), and gained a better understanding of my diet. You should give SixPax Gyms free training session a try if you want your life to be surrounded by other motivational people which cause you to stay focused and have fun while staying in shape - which is something your not going to find at many other gyms.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Siavash and Perry are very knowledgable and attentive. Siavash, the owner, makes it a point to train most of his clients and remembers us all by our name and specific fitness goals. He checks in on diet and cardio and it keeps me motivated. Stick to his plan and you will see results fast. I’ve leaned the most about how to train effectively and fix my diet from Siavash than I have from any other boutique fitness classes in the west side. This gym will start to feel like a second home for you :)</Text>

The work outs are top notch. They incorporate a lot of different lifts that really work your whole body. Those 30 minute sessions are incredible. Also you can use the cardio machines any time you want so it's really easy to have a flexible schedule here. The diet I was provided was simple but very effective. Everything about this gym is legitimate and worth every penny. Also the entire staff is down to earth. Everyone wants you to succeed and there are no egos. Just good ole exercise and weight training. I learned quite a bit here and I progressed quickly.<//Text>

Having injured my back years ago in a car accident, I have never been able to properly train. Somehow I always ended up in severe pain. Working with Siavash and the team at SixPax Gym has been a godsend! They create an incredibly supportive and motivating environment! And I have not hurt my back once. To the contrary, my core is stronger and weight loss has made me feel 100% better. I trust the team there. I know they will work me HARD but not let me hurt myself. Highly recommended no matter who you are, age, body shape, and preexisting injuries. Just bring your commitment!<//Review>

My name is Alex Ceron and I first stepped in to 6pax gym about a year ago and I can honestly say it has changed my life completely!!! I was in the worst shape of my life, hadn’t been to a gym in over 9 years, horrible eating and drinking habits, and was lacking the motivation to do anything about it. Being a resident of Culver City and driving past 6pax gym every day I decided to call and go in for the free first session. When I met siavash I could tell off the bat he is a businessman and dedicated to his clients!! Since day one he has pushed me to be my best self in the gym, at home, and in all aspects of life! He has become a mentor and roll model for me! Since joining I have lost over 60 pounds and counting all while steadily gaining muscle!!! Siavash has truly taught me the meaning of hard work, dedication, and trusting the process. I’m truly grateful for all the lessons he has taught me and believing in me and pushing me to go harder, even when I wanted to give up and I didn’t believe in my self, siavash WOULD NOT LET ME FAIL!!!! SixPax’s gym has brought out the best in me!!!

If you want to change you’re life, lose weight, and become the best version of yourself COME TO 6PAX GYM!!! COME JOIN OUR FAMILY!!</Text>

My whole family works out at this gym.  You start your fitness journey with Six Pax and truly become a family member - they share the joy of losing a pound, and Jennifer and Siavash try to figure out where you need to work on your diet to get the very best out of your efforts.

Great place to grow stronger and more fit!  With 2 kids and 2 jobs, we don't have a lot of spare time. At Sixpax you get right to it, work hard, and get it done. They keep the intensity right at the top of where you can handle it, and the results are clear.< /Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>I went to SixPax Gym after trying to reach my goals for years.  I've done several other gyms in the past, and have put together my own home gym, and I always plateaued.  I am currently go through school to become a nurse, and with all the stress, I had gained 10lbs, I felt weak and rundown, and my blood pressure was getting high.  One week with Siavash and Peri, and I was already seeing results.  After a few months, I dropped more than the 10lbs I had gained and am now back at my old high school weight, I'm stronger, I don't feel sluggish anymore, and my blood pressure is back to normal.  Thank you guys over at SixPax so much, and you guys will definitely be seeing me again in the future.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>It has been a little over a year since I started coming to Six Pax. Four months ago, I wrote a review that explained how I believe that this gym is LEGIT. Fast forward to now, my feelings are still strong about this gym. In fact, Six Pax is more than legit. Six Pax is authentic on what they do for their clients. Only true warriors can keep up with Six Pax. Only those who really want to change their fitness lifestyle will feel and see the results from Six Pax.

I'm telling you that there are no trainers from those big gyms (e.g. 24 hours, LA fitness) who will give you the same level of motivation you need everyday than what Siavash and Peri can provide you! You don't believe me? Come check it out yourself. Oh and when you do, don't forget to say hi to me so I can tell you, "I told you so!" ;)<//text>< pictures>

With the help of Siavash and Peri, I've gotten down to the lowest I've weighed since high school while building more muscle than I have before. I'm really impressed with how quickly I started to get results and can't thank SixPax enough for pushing me during each session.< /Review>

My experience has been great! My wife USED to tell me, that when we met my torso looked like a "V" and after a few years of being married it turned into an "O". Thanks to SIX PAX, my body is returning to the "V". I used to waste time and money on equipment and weights, but now I look forward to a short and intensive workout that is old school ... like "Rocky 1", keeping it simple and doing it right. At 45, the body shows, feels and operates differently then it did at 20. Siavash's workouts are short and direct, targeting your weakest and smallest muscles to balance the body out. It's been about 6 months and I see the difference. My strength is coming back. I feel better than I did when I was in my 20's. If you want to do it right the first time, don't waste your time anywhere else. I've been there and done that with the other gyms. Quality or quantity? Don't regret the past, embrace your future. "THIS GYM REALLY BUILDS MUSCLE".<//Text>

<Review>This gym is great! I had never worked out consistently before I started training at Six Pax Gym. My body did not know what hit it after my first session with Siavash. I could barely lift my arms to work my car's steering wheel let alone use my legs on the pedals. After the first few sessions (about 4 or 5) my body acclimated to the intensity of the workouts. This is not to say that the workouts ever got easy. By the end of my first round of training I had exceeded the goals I had set for myself when I started. I am 32 years old and in the best shape of my life as of this review. I am eating better and my overall health has improved incredibly. Siavash and Jennifer provide everything you need to get in shape. They support you and give you guidance while you are there.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2ba166eb67bfd:0x3d7e88ffc43c03e6< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I lost 10lbs in 1 month by following Siavash's low fat/low carbs meal plan and weekly trainings, so results speak for themselves! It isn't cheap but you get what you pay for: personalized and intimate trainings, great advices and most importantly a lot of help to stay motivated! Also, you can come anytime during business hours to do your cardio or even pull some weight; it isn't limited to your personal trainings! Don't be intimidated by the bodybuilding pictures on the wall, I saw all shapes of people: Men, women, old or young, fat or skinny! It is for everyone. The first 30min session is free so give yourself a favor and stop-by.</review>< pics>

The gym has a culture of its own, all the members are kind and encouraging, you won't find any ego here. Since I joined SixPax, I've lost 20+ pounds, become stronger and, more importantly, healthier.

<text>I've been coming to this gym for three years now.  Since I'm not a self motivator when it comes to exercise, this place has been a blessing.  Siavash is easily the toughest personal trainer with whom I've worked out.  He packs as much exercise into 30 minutes as most people do in an hour.  I mean it. There is no time to rest.  A set of weight reps is followed immediately by a core exercise, and then it's back to the weights.  And the diet plan he recommended for me has really turned my life around.  I've managed to maintain my weight goal, be healthy, and look great.  I can't recommed this place highly enough.< /text>< name>

I recently moved to the LA/Culver City area and was looking for a new gym to join. After seeing that SixPax had a 5-star rating on Yelp and being so close to home, I decided to try out the free trial session.
I met Siavash, Jennifer and Peri there, all three of them are extremely kind and helpful. I totally got my ass kicked in the first session!! After being pushed to my limits, I decided this was the right fit for me to get on track for my fitness.
Upon joining here, I also received a meal plan to follow. Jenn is consistent with checking up on you to make sure you do follow the diet and to make sure you come in to work out everyday, even on your days off just to do cardio.
I had finished my 8 sessions and still had one week left before my new month started so Jenn threw in 2 FREE sessions along with a challenge to lose 5 lbs in 10 days or I would have to pay for the sessions, needless to say...I lost the 5 lbs!!
You can tell they care about your health and fitness here and aren't just trying to make a quick buck.
Siavash and Peri are great trainers, they push you hard and motivate you to make you feel better about yourself. I've been coming here almost two months now and see a great difference in my physical fitness.
They're the best!!<//Text>

I was 18  when I first began body building and achieved far more than I thought possible.

Siavash is very smart and understands how to work with people personally and professionally. He’s well equipped to customize a program for you. Also, I was very impressed with his life’s story and how he became the “beast” he is today!

I renewed my membership multiple times; I  have learned how to eat with discipline, train with structure and  because of the  caring person  that he is, I felt like he helped to change my life in a very positive way. He’s the best trainer and you count on him to listen, and provide feedback and advice! And of course you will learn how to change your body to how you want to look .

Both the owners are very caring, have a great sense of humor  and sincerely care about you.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba166eb67bfd:0x3d7e88ffc43c03e6<//Gmap_id></record>

Great experience training with Siavash! One of a kind instruction and approach to a great 30 minute training that felt like one on one training  even within the group session. The Sixpax crew and gym were welcoming and such a great positive and welcoming  atmosphere for folks at every level of fitness. The Sixpax Facebook page is a daily dose of motivation and successes from members! Three thumbs up to Siavash and the Sixpax crew for an awesome culture of positivity and encouragement!</review>

<review>I have been overweight for years. I went thru most of the weight loss plan that  I find on the web but all were temporary. When I lost hope and thinking about surgery, I was introduced to Siavash @ SIX PAX GYM. My first day trail session was eye opening. I made a commitment and lost 50 LBS in 4 months and keep going.< /review><time>1492740393363<//time>< pictures>

<Review>Started here in Feb 13' with the intent to drop some weight and get in shape. Siavash took me under his wing and showed me everything i needed to know about exercise, and nutrition . I ended up losing 50 lbs of body fat, and  getting in the best shape of my life . They keep you on track, and tell you to focus on the bigger picture, which is what anyone who wants to commit to fitness needs . I will recommend this to anyone who is overweight and wants to make a change, or wants to kick their fitness into overdrive.

Let Siavash assess you and get on the path to greatness! Six pax gym where it goes down!</Review>< pictures>

< Review>
I've been going to Six Pax for just about a year. Words can't express how much I have changed in that year. Not only do I feel like I am in the best shape of my life, but the confidence I feel about my body and my strength is amazing! Siavash and the team will push you - and it's awesome. It might not be the gym with the most amenities - but of all the places I researched and attended in my quest to find my "fitness home," nothing compares to Six Pax. No one has been as supportive and yet as demanding - and the results speak for themselves. My weight is down to a level it hasn't been since college. My body fat percentage is down lower than it was in high school! Try out Six Pax and you'll be hooked!< /Review>

<Text>If you are determined or even not so sure about being determined to make a change in your life, join Six Pax. This gym has a reputation to change that uncertainty to a conclusive decision.

I've been going there for a month and I have seen unreal progress. I am indeed glad to know Siavashi and Peri - two larger than life folks who will motivate you, push you, hag you, cajole you, celebrate your little successes, push you some more and then some more until you give it a hundred and ten percent. There's really no way around these two. They know all the usual excuses and reasons why we don't want to work out today... Haha! As Siavashi says 'Everything is about 'the now!' "

The simple strategy at Six Pax is that this studio is run with an ironclad sense of integrity and no-nonsense attitude. It's all about hard work, relentless perseverance, uncompromising resolve and giving each day your uber-best with a 'quasi-squint eyed teeth-gnashing focused' gaze that will strike terror in the heart of the onlooker. I kid you not, my friend.

Should you falter, be prepared to receive a text message questioning why you haven't stayed on course. Prepare to be shock and awed. But the best part is the joy of realizing your goals or simply finding yourself on the way to it, like me. These folks are all about getting you to your goal and accomplishing the little steps that so many of us feel that we really have no time for.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ba166eb67bfd:0x3d7e88ffc43c03e6<//gmap_id></record>

For the past 15 years I've worked out religiously. 6 days a week, sometimes twice a day. I've gone to multiple gyms. I've taken every class under the sun -Zumba, Pilates, Yoga, Spin -you name it! Then 7 months ago I started a new job. I stopped working out entirely. I was too stressed to do more than pass out after work. After 3 months I was an unhealthy mess. I would walk my dog past Sixpax and think, "My gawd! Look at those people. They are hard core. And dare I say, they look like they are enjoying it!" I finally went in for a consult and training. I've been going for a little over three months, and I have a stronger core, more defined muscle, and better cardio than I ever did in the 15 years of mishmash workouts. You feel as though you are family when you work out at Sixpax. You really feel the want they have for you to succeed. I'll get a text from Jennifer asking how my diet is going and how I'm feeling. I'll walk in for cardio and see a huge smile spread over Siavash's face followed by a, "right on Erin!!" And Peri never lets me cut corners and peter out, "Come on! Five more!" I can't say enough good things about the folks at Sixpax. They have achieved something truly special here. .

Six Pax is truly an old school gym.  I am talking hitting tires with a sledgehammer or lifting them at times :)  You train hard, probably harder than you may have in the past but the results are undeniable.  They are very dedicated and the personal attention that you get in training one on one is great.  For me, knowing that I'm being trained by an award winning bodybuilder and trainer like Siavash gives me confidence and he motivates me when I literally do not believe I can do another rep.

I love that the gym is open pretty much all day as well so if you want to go in and do your cardio or do a quick solo workout you can at any time.  Additionally, the rates are very favorable.  I have spent a lot of money in the past on personal trainers, especially considering that Six Pax also provides a nutrion plan based on what you want to accomplish.

Lastly, I must say it does have a family environment to it, with both the staff and customers.  There is a lot of support and I look forward to going in every day to do my cardio on days that I am not lifting.  I have gotten results that I did not think I could because I finally pushed myself to where I needed to be a long time ago.

Would highly recommend it for people serious about getting in shape.  But you have to be committed.  My first day I threw up, almost twice.  That's how badly out of shape I was.  Next time felt similar, but no hurling.  Then slowly I built myself up to a point where I can now lift and flip a tire twice my weight.</review>

Great location and parking.  Went to see my grandson play Little League baseball.  I do wish the snack bar was open.  Guessing it's not open due to covid-19.< /text>

Such an amzing place to have here in town. The kids have tons of sporting events. Here and they always want to show up early or stay a little later to play on the playground. They have swings, three slides, and monkey bars. Plenty of trees around so that you can sit in the shade when ya need a break.< /Text>

<Text>My youngest daughter has been obsessed with “her yellow sea plane” since she was a toddler so it was only natural to surprise her with a seaplane tour on her 7th birthday aboard “her” plane. Fred was an amazing pilot! He made us feel comfortable and was very thorough in our tour, giving us all of the wonderful history of the area. As locals, we didn’t expect to learn much but we did! Our 10-year old son sat in the front with Fred as the “co-pilot”. Only their microphones were working so we all got to hear their “commentary” on the history of the area. A wonderful history lesson for kids and adults! I was nervous boarding the plane but once we took off and got used to the sensation, I felt at ease and mesmerized by the beautiful views. My daughter felt a little woozy so Fred made sure to stay steady and not do any maneuvering that would make her feel ill. Overall, it was an unforgettable experience and we are so grateful we got to do this.<//Text>< pictures>

As you can see, it was phenomenal! It really is a great tour( they have several to offer) right now they fly Fri Sat &Sun, you can book for 2 ppl, up to 6, ( inside secret, decide before you go who gets to be the co pilot, you don't do anything , but get to sit in front)... All seats have views, it's an easy exit off freeway, with its own parking, if you live in the 3 hour vicinity of mill valley ,Marin.. it's WORTH IT!! TALK to Anna or Ed in the office. If you ask, they may give locals a discount,have your ID when checking in, and you have to fill out a liability waiver before, you can do your booking and payment on line, as well as waiver, SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES!!<//Review>

<text>I really can't say enough great things about this adventure! We took the sea plane from Marin over the city and then up around so many beautiful cliffs and beaches. W We went over the city and heard so many great facts about landmarks and of course the beautiful bridge. Our pilot was so great and didn't overwhelm us with talking too much- it was just right. You can cover so much more land than you would by car so you can see everything!

I think this is a great trip for tourists or anyone in the Bay just looking for a little adventure.

I also felt very safe with their COVID precautions!<//text>< pics>

<Text>Wow what an experience! I took a flight with my wife and daughter around the bay and city. The lady in reception was a delight over the phone and face to face. The only slight negative was the charmless pilot. There are two so it's a 50/50 situation and he may have been having an off day! A propley worth while thing to do and not crazy expensive either..<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPM7KUfYjDdysS2bCcrUU_wD4XU4A5PBurxrEpt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPaAEu6YYHJi2h8hRpdMXtlOj63bKrUjiSiRWQJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMMFZX9iLFp-YaVX0xRYPvycaLT-kzRKDwvfnKe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMsJWU7GryZ8ELk8jDM-0V-ADDH4bp5FycFEoIi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMjXK1W4TJHAKGDpwsxx5fqB_1IPCe7M4L58s6T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNRisQbwYYn31l5d-NM2mTjSYU7ypBFdzCtXWHK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7RHtyY7d8_dnnd7c7LOwshtYqEUPMbcTbdaHy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x8085854a5e6701dd:0x280439fb839bce11< /gmap_id></record>

I'm sure the tour would be fun. But, to the owner- you have a lot of nerve flouting public health regulations by claiming you are a an "essential air carrier". You are not an essential air carrier. You are a leisure company. You do not transport essential workers or medical supplies. You fly tourists who want to see the sights. So please, tone down the entitled attitude and stop acting like the rules don't apply to you. You're not special. Comply or (hopefully) be fined.< /Text>

<Review>We had to listen to pilot’s tour. Would have been nice if we had a chance to talk let alone speak(com unit only on when guide spoke). Very hyped pilot did not give any consideration to passengers until a child cried. $500 plus could provide better service. The views were spectacular though.<//Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< UserId.>

Definitely one of life's peak experiences. My wife and daughters treated me for this aeral tour for my 50th birthday. Our pilot John waas fantastic! Knowlegeable, courteous, and exudes confidence and good will. The weather was perfect on a mid-March weekend and we enjoyed the vistas of the the city, the bay, and Muir woods. John's flying introduced us to what the glorius birds of the bay see and enjoy every day of their lives.</review>

1st took tour 25 yrs ago and several times since, including this week. Lived in San Francisco and know the area well. This is the best thing to do in SF in my opinion. Views are unbelievable. Pilot very friendly. (Wouldn't mind just a bit less talking from him.., plus should do a bit more research as info wasn't entirely accurate..)  Highly recommended and plan to do this every time in town.<//Text>

Our pilot was so kind, he let me sit in the front and told us so much about Frisco.
For me as an aviation enthusiast definitely worth the money

My family was going on expecting a nice tour I’m 14 and get very motion sick and it took a long time to convince me to get over my fear and go fly upon hearing in conversation I was really happy I was beating my motion sickness the pilot turned around and asked me if I was motion sick I said not really a few minutes later he nose dived and I spent the last twenty of the thirty minutes gagging breathing into a bag and hating flying as a whole thanks a lot</Text>

<text>I booked a flight for my sisters birthday. They picked us up at Pier 39 and then tour before the tour begann. Paul our driver was really nice and explained all the places we passed. And we even got to drive over the Golden Gate Bridge.
Arrived we were welcomed very friendly. The seaplane with our pilot Aron awaited us already. He was great, very funny and polite. He explained everything to us and even talked to us in pretty good German. We felt totally safe. We were lucky and the only ones on board.
It was a great experience! We had great condition. No fog. My favorite part was really to fly over the Golden Gate Bridge. I could have done it a couple more times.
On our tour back to Pier 39 Paul gave us a couple tipps for life. He has seen a lot.
All together we can say: Great experience. It is worth it and very nice people. Very familiar atmosphere.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Rating>1</Rating><text>I decided to do a 2nd seaplane tour for my  son today on a drop-in and told the guy with glasses at the counter.  he nodded but didn't say athing. waiting for 20 mins later after he retrieved a sea plane and served 2 more reserved customers. then I asked him again for a tour.  at this point he said they are all booked and have to wait till afternoon.  What an smot! NO CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILL  AT ALLl!!!!  he could have say this early on or say something like let me get back to you.   I have a pilot license myself and will not pay $300 tour + humiliation dealing with this lack of customer service.  I guess I will pilot my rental plane doing my own tour.</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Name>Eco Victor<//Name><Time>1541027724346</Time><rate>5</rate><review>(Translated by Google) Excellent attention. I contacted them through their website. They answered me quickly, and answered all my questions. The ride is excellent as is the pilot. Maneuver so that interesting points can be seen from both sides of the plane. Takeoff, flight and landing were surprisingly smooth. Smoother than a line flight. Completely satisfied. Thank you so much for everything.

Excelente atención. Me comuniqué con ellos a través de su pagina web. Me contestaron rápidamente, y contestaron todas mis dudas. El paseo es excelente igual que el piloto. Maniobra de manera que los puntos interesantes se puedan ver de ambos lados del avión. El despegue, vuelo y amerizaje fueron sorprendentemente suaves. Mas suave que un vuelo de linea. Completamente satisfecho. Muchas gracias por todo.</review>< pics>

(Translated by Google) AWESOME ! Flight (45 minutes) performed in early September with a splendid weather! We received the shuttle (picked up and returned to Pier 39). Wonderful experience, breathtaking views of San Francisco, Alcatraz, Golden Gate, Sausalito, Muir Woods and surrounding areas. We were fortunate to have the French driver, very friendly (we were quickly comfortable), competent and experienced who commented on all places overflown. Unforgettable moment and to renew. I highly recommend.

GENIAL ! Vol (de 45 minutes) effectué début septembre avec un temps splendide ! Nous avons bénéficié de la navette (pris en charge et ramenés au Pier 39). Merveilleuse expérience, vues époustouflantes de San Francisco, Alcatraz, Golden Gate, Sausalito, Muir Woods et ses environs. Nous avons eu la chance d'avoir le pilote francophone, très sympathique (nous a mis très vite à l'aise), compétent et expérimenté qui a commenté tous les lieux survolés. Moment inoubliable et à renouveler. Je recommande vivement.< /review>

Excellent Customer service. Johnny was very friendly and the shop was very receptive to this first time customer. This is no doubt a neighborhood favorite barber shop. The owner was very friendly as well, making small talk and making me feel welcomed. I'll be back for sure</review>

Jenny has high level associates working for her, as she runs a great shop. Johnny is by far the most talented stylist I have ever had and will keep! His fades are perfect! His attention to detail allows the customer to leave with a great haircut experience and dam, that fade rocks! I will never go to another shop again. Thank you Jenny and of course Johnny, you are it man!<//Text>

< review>
I’ve been going to Augie & Lynn’s shop since 1997, 22yrs and counting now. From the very first week I moved to the Bay Area. Augie and Lynn were good people, and Lynn gave me many many great haircuts. I tried a few other shops early on since I didn’t always live close by, but they didn’t compare. I would drive 30mi to go Augie & Lynn’s every time I needed a haircut. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it!

A couple years ago, Lynn retired and Jenny came in as the owner. She immediately upgraded the interior of the shop, which is a whole lot nicer to hang out in. She also recently renamed the business to Jenny’s. Jenny has expanded the staff, and I’ve gotten haircuts from all of them, and all give great haircuts! They’re all friendly people, and it’s just a comfortable place to be for an hour. I see people of all types and ages going there. I don’t see any reason to get a haircut anywhere else for the next 22yrs! Really a top notch barber shop.<//review>

Good barbers, friendly and like the TVs. They have some.nice touches to this place: 4 flat.screen TVs, refreshments for sale, straight razor sideburn and neck shave, and talented barbers. One downside is there are too few people working at the busiest times. Wait can be 2-3 haircut: 60-90 minutes if you come with one barber working. Definitely go back but plan your visit.</Text>

Brian is the best. Pays great attention to detail and was willing to stay a few minutes late so I could get a cut as soon as I could make it there from the airport. Wish we had his talent and pricing in Utah.<//text>

Clean,  affordable and a good solid haircut! I got a "high- and- tight fade" for a mere $17! My barber Johnnie is full service,  shaving cream/ straight razor and all.  And great conversation too. They play good music and the wait was not bad at all. It's first come first served,  so don't forget to sign yourself in when you arrive. Plenty of parking, they prefer cash and there's no ATM.<//review>

Open 7 days a week. Friendly service.  It's cash only.
I don't usually carry any on me.
They let me go to an ATM after my haircut. I appreciate the trust!</Text>

<Text>As for me loved it when Lynn actually owned the place now I’m not so sure went to get a haircut and they left my hair uneven on sides normally Lynn used thinning shears although the person that cut my hair likes to go fast and use only a razor with guard. Listen I never post anything on internet but after the experience I felt it necessary to voice my opinion. Really miss the old time barbers that took pride in their work and did not worry about volume! That is all I have to say about that I will be looking for you old time barbershop< /Text></record>

< Review>
Been going to this place for awhile now. PHIL and JENNY is the best!!! I used to go to Supercuts and I always leave feeling worse than when I went in. It’s out of my way to go here but worth a good cut. Anytime I try to go somewhere closer to home I regret it! Otherwise, the shop is very CLEAN and the price is lowest in Town!</Review>

Great spot to get a clean fade and comb over! I get a hair cut every 2 weeks here and it's fantastic EVETY SINGLE TIME! Great quality hair cuts, outstanding customer service, with an extremely friendly environment! Would recommend to anyone if they want to look like Channing Tatum or Liam Hemsworth!<//review>

<username>Cluckers< /username><Text>Told them that I didn't go to the barber often and all I wanted was to cut my hair short (long hair bothers me). In my past experience with barbers, they would have no clue how to cut my hair with such a general instruction. However, to my surprise, the lady  barber started to work and style my hair to unprecedented lengths which resulted in a speechless and astonished customer. These ladies are serious about their profession. Go and experience for yourselves.< /Text>< GmapID>

From the set menu, we did the smoked salmon salad and shrimp as appetizers + hanger steak and halibut as entrees + chocolate cake and coconut baked Alaska as dessert. We also added a half a dozen oysters and two espressos. Absolutely delicious, calm and beautiful ambiance, and excellent service.< /Text>< pictures>

This was our first trip to Palm Springs and Le Vallauris, and this did not disappoint! We attended their brunch service on Sunday and were seated in the patio. The patio was energetic, fun and very romantic. They offered a set menu with a choice of an app and entree paired with complementary champagne and desert. The appetizers, entree and dessert were all amazing and the services was outstanding. We said it was possibly our favorite brunch we have ever attended. We wish they had a location closer to us as were just visiting. We highly recommend Le Vallauris for Sunday brunch!</Review>

Always an exquisite dining experience for newly 40 years.  Probably the best fine dining experience in the desert.   Amazing seafood and delicious soups.  And I always enjoy their perfectly prepared French 75 cocktail.  If you’re looking for authentic French, fine dining cuisine, this is the place to go!< /text>

<text>Love the cozy outdoor seating. Tables were well spaced out. Waiters were very attentive. Food was the best we had in Palms Springs - Lobster Bisque was DELICIOUS! Escargots was amazing. Duck was cooked so well with crispy skin and moist meat. Great wine list.</text>< Rating>

<Review>I will never forget this experience. From having Mark, our server, guide us through my favorite regions of France and wine to the severed making sure that our pre-fine menu was on point, this was the experience that I was so excited for. Kudos to chef, servers, sommeliers, and everyone.<//Review><UserId.>110343083159073068186<//UserId.><time>1620622444523< /time>< Gmap_id>

First the outdoor seating is perfect, it looks like you are in Provence with the larges trees. Then the team speaks French and is friendly. Finally and the most important the food, I’m French so trust me this is the real French food, delicate, elegant and full of flavors. The « île flottante «  is the same my grandma used to do for me when I was young!
This restaurant is one of my favorites in Palm Springs !<//Text>< resp>

I cannot say how amazing this place is. Roasted tomato avocado soup, escargot, the bread shaped like wheat sheaves, the V stamped butter, amazing steak, lamb, shrimp. Wow! The vichyssoise was to die for! Our service was impeccable by even Michelin standards! Comprehensive wine list! You can order in French if you wish! The owners are charming and the maitre d' is a prince among men. The bartender mad one mean Manhattan and Bloody Mary! I was beyond impressed.< /review>

This is one of the best places we have ever eaten, we were here last year for a Sunday brunch and have been looking forward to coming back ever since. You have a choice of six or eight salads, main courses, and desserts, they keep the champagne flowing. Everything was excellent. Our waitresses was from Paris and had a lovely French accent. Reservations.< /review>

They have amazing ficus trees on the patio which were planted years ago by the owner.  I was there for a birthday party for a close friend.  We had around 40 people in the private dining room.  I had the salmon and my wife had the filet.  Both were spot on!  The wines were perfectly paired for the dinner.  Overall a great place for dinner in Palm Springs.</Review>< pics>

When you go to Le Vallauris, you immediately encounter a very welcoming  and helpful staff.  The service and atmosphere is always superb.  They have an extensive wine list and the food is always fantastic.  A great venue for that “special night” or just a night out on the town.< /text>

<rating>3<//rating><review>Beautiful setting, decent service and some hits and misses when it comes to the food.

It's obvious why so many rave about the gorgeous setting, especially at night with the outdoor lights. Thai night did not disappoint, except maybe the crowd. It was the 15th of February, so there may have been some carry over from Valentines which typically makes great restaurants ordinary due to the kitchen being overwhelmed. Same goes with service. At times I felt rushed and out of place and other times treated as expected in a high end restaurant. I guess only another visit during a typical dinner service will tell.

As for the food, the Rack of lamb was delish but why call it a rack when it was just chops? The braised beef cheeks were not our fave, but ok. Same for the Red beet salad. We were very disappointed in the Spanish octopus cocktail. It was like a bad version of a typical octopus cocktail at a mariscos restaurant. I only wish i had tapatio to add some extra flavor. The real winner and highlight of the night was the Grand Marnier Soufflé. That did not disappoint, neither did the "show"<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRZrTfYHZpt4PcmINeytrRH-rxnl0b7w8gTtPy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPudDyPqwF6ixH6MHqa7Rp5URyC8Bv-qpkBiuK-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP8UEAil8Ak4aKA7XgKaFIE1aB8xlM5_cS8ajHh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMzoYfROCMxCNoSTPnCvadsbRWz9p5qMAhVQ2pN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXf-z9aFJKyitPT35mkcGCABrahEUp35h1pCX5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOc4cdCm0UPu8UjEM3MxtLI69vXxzMtHG6KXlRC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpwckvUXXcfjN_zdLXRsUoMhRHHJf-REEB0PsJ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOqtitdnITZqVZmnWYD8hPxNvCO-LO5c_AX7l1p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNT4TzH7XY0XAhWonCvGRiVJfUsABaH3OtIOlRL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPkIcRTJlHClvUvW2QLp4hUwalu7ZWG-dOiGLSP=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNpLDY9qgNKbr8HIr27NpLWaAL25LcFDnfTIkjI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2RQc5gIPcJFYyuMuizEa6VEj_RbS4u9CI55TT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOWYXN6SImsCn76vai90CebJbFYfsved5Cb4_IE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Beautiful, delicious food! We enjoyed the fixed Christmas menu, reminding us of France, with appetizer, main, and dessert.  If you enjoy excellent service with French flair, an extensive wine list, and cozy white linen tablecloth ambiance, this is for you. Worth the price, especially for special occasions. Outside seating is inviting and perfect for the desert. Looking forward to our next visit.<//Review>

< Review>
Great experience for Christmas dinner! They had a Christmas dinner menu that was so good with a nice variety of food. The lobster Ravioli was amazing for the entree! Would highly suggest ordering that! The Pear appeared to be one of the most popular ordered as we saw many going around all night. The pecan pie was the best out of the three we tried. Would go back again for dinner. Thanks for a great night. Wonderful staff too!!!</Review>

< Review>
We went here due to other peoples recommendations. The ambience was very old school chic. Service was friendly and formal. Food was good.

Overall, we found it pricey for what you received. Enjoyed our time but most likely would not return again.

Enjoyed many other restaurants in Palm Springs more.<//Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>I have been to enough elegant dining restaurants and most have an area or two that elevate them above their competitors.  For some, the food is great but the service is lackluster or the food shines more because the restaurant atmosphere somehow makes one believe it to be true...  However this restaurant is astonishing on every level. The service is unprecedented. The atmosphere and the layout are truly special. And when you combine those 2 elements with the food, you have created le vallauris..  I cannot_in us what a fantastic evening You will have after taking this recommendation. Top 3 restaurants in Palm Desert or Palm Springs.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDOj_xCQJpHv6Wp_CJ8wp7IBUtNjzJtjIbzrcQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM2A3kmx-uoFmhiLhJdOBScNrhFew_w6Csds3OR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP75Vn6Q3dUhZKbEPOwaLOrgOhKonpcfHmkUaF5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmKFRPX-J3e70C6vRST_wCxr7hCnvWtPmOR4lc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNmpr83_WlGJImX8eSIc3Htk-c6WTJFLNsnusPb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80db1baf83485a69:0x3d96a368d844e9da<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Had the wonderful experience of Xmas dinner at Le Vallauris. The food was delicious and elegantly presented. I enjoyed a dinner of rack of lamb with smoked duck as my appetizer. Both were exceptional and perfectly prepared.  The service was flawless.
I would love to return and check out the entire menu.< /review>< username>

Stunning!!! Many places want to be French restaurant but this is it! Good food comes in small portions and costs more. Yet, after leaving this place you will not be hungry but you will want to come back. I went twice, a private dinner and a group gathering of 30+people. In both cases it was perfect. Excellent food and incredible wine list. Considering many California places offer mostly domestic wine these guys go all the way back to France, whatever you desire. Even had a chance to practice my very weak French with most of the personnel. Service, food and wine all 5 Star level.</text>

< Review>
Impeccable restaurant, in all aspects, from reservation, to service, to food.

Tony Bruggemans, the manager, was a pleasure to work with. I had a fairly large group with me, and he was very accommodating and made sure we had the best experience possible. Raymond and all members of the staff (sorry I didn't get all their names to be able to mention each one individually as they deserve) provided the best restaurant service I've had in a long time.

And the food is out of this world. Special mention to the Grand Marnier soufflé for dessert. Impressive and delicious.

I received many compliments for organizing the event, but Tony and the restaurant staff are the ones who deserve all credit.<//Review>

Amazing service and food. The bread is something you can break your keto for and the sweetbreads are divine.  I would also suggest the duck and the lobster ravioli. All in all just a place you have to try in Palm springs.< /Review>

I absolutely adore this restaurant!! Air conditioning, outside, can you believe it?! This place is truly something magical. They have indoor and outdoor seating but we sat outside, in the air conditioning, under the lighted trees. They have a pre fixe menu and a hand written a la carte menu that is brought to your table via white board. Our servers were fabulous and the entire staff were so friendly and attentive. This is a great place to spend a special occasion. I had the poached pear as a starter, lobster for my entree, and panna cotta for dessert; everything was divine. I will definitely be returning.< /Text>

The service is attentive, the menu selections varied and the quality cannot be matched in the valley.  Its not just a place for special events--its a haven for escape from crazy Palm Springs during "the season".< /Review><gmap_id>0x80db1baf83485a69:0x3d96a368d844e9da< /gmap_id><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Very underwhelming experience for Palm Springs Restaurant Week. The menu was a poor value compared to many of the other places I’ve gotten to try this week, and I was pretty shocked at the lack of flavor in the food.

All three courses were bland as can be, unexciting, and lacking any texture - everything was a different form of mush. In all fairness their demographic was very old... we were definitely the only people below 50 in the restaurant, so that probably suits their target market. Most of the food was not remotely French either, which was a pretty big letdown.

Maybe their regular menu is decent, but based on this experience I cannot recommend this establishment. Impeccable service, as our server was pleasant and attentive - but that did not make up for the subpar dining experience.<//review>

Exceptional French fine dining! Expensive but well worth it. The owner walks around the restaurant and will converse in French with you. Sit on the patio set around trees wrapped in strands of white lights. Service is amazingly good - very attentive staff.< /Review>

Superb! Get a seat on the enchanting treed patio, and you won't want to leave. We felt like old Hollywood royalty, and felt worlds away. An expert dining experience in every way. Impossible to not want to try everything on their menu and wine list. And that was just at lunch....</review>

First bad experience at restaurant. We tried to order items from dinner menu at lunch. Thought we were ok but not so much.
The miscommunication I can deal with but when the steamed lobster tail came out as a deconstructed chilled salad and I sent back the problem started.

First another waiter came and explained that was how they served lobster at lunch....

Next head waiter came by I explained the issue and he threw his waiter under the bus,   being new and incompetent.

Thinking when you spend $350 w/tip for lunch resolution rather than trashing the help would be a better approach.

I will still go back as this was the first bad experience over a number of good but trashing help rather than resolving issue needs to be addressed.<//text>

I am long time winter resident of the desert I have not been to the restaurant for over a year.  I was very disappointed by the food. I had a lobster bisque which had no lobster and was equivalent to Campbell's tomato soup.
As usual the service was impeccable but I didn't enjoy my meal. Very surprising!</Text>

Entering this restaurant is a bit like stepping back into the 1960s, but in the best possible way.  It's a beautiful restaurant run by an excellent staff serving delicious food.  The menu is classically French, but some things are classic for a reason.  Dress to impress, and try to get a table under the trees.</review>

<Text>We've dined here three times and next week will be our fourth.  We love the atmosphere, the service and special attention from the owner who stops by the table for a little chit chat and has done so on every visit.  We never expect him to remember us, and that's okay!  It shows he takes an interest and makes you feel a little special.  The menu is pretty interesting, some innovative and some standards, but always high quality, always delicious. Great for quiet, romantic evenings.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80db1baf83485a69:0x3d96a368d844e9da< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The host Patrice is a gem and our waiter Olivier truly fantastic. We had a prix fixe in our group which is a wonderful value and quite delicious, fresh full oysters, amazing duck, and out of this world lobster ravioli. Don't miss cocktails, wine or dessert. Do it all. Outstanding all around.<//Text>

The service was great and the location was pretty nice as well. But the food was not worth the price, by far. It was decent but when you spend so much on it it should be fantastic. And it should all be at the proper temperature (not lukewarm sausage and octopus) and look great on the plate as well.</Text>

Last night we were taken to Le Vallauris in Palm Springs. From the moment I walked into the restaurant with the piano player playing a favorite song it was a night to remember. We ate outside under the beautiful trees and white bulbs popping through the trees. Our dinner was awesome. I started with Lobster Bisque-to die for and then had the duck cooked to perfection. The others had lobster, a special plate with lots of goodies and the filet. We topped it off with an ice cream toasting and creme brûlée. The service was exceptional and an experience we won’t forget.</text>

<review>One year ago next month I had the most enchanting special birthday party for my mother.  We had 32 people on the patio at tables of 8 each.  The food and service were just amazing. I planned it for the Sunday brunch. They have a lovely Sunday brunch every week in season so planning it for that day made my process so smooth.  The price per person was already established and guests got to choose and be served by attentive and kind staff, it's not a buffet.  Everyone loved it and I'm planning a much smaller repeat this year for her.  It's become a family tradition destination; a truly special patio under their lovely and very old trees. Thank you Le Vallauris.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

We enjoyed a lovely evening as first timers here.  We had the delicious tuna tartare  and duck and pistachio salami appetizers, beef cheeks and sweetbreads. The live piano music was nice but for me,  with the clanking of the bar behind us,  it was a bit on the loud side.  You might want to reserve the larger room for your table.<//Text>

<text>Excellent country French restaurant in Palm Springs.  Excellent, knowledgeable and attentive wait staff.  We truly enjoyed the 5 course chef's menu, but plan to go back to try some of the a la carte entrees.  $$$ , but not outrageous for the quality of the food and service.  This is going to be one of our stops each trip to Palm Springs. Good variety, esp Bordeauxs, of French wines including 1st and 2nd growths.</text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1551162298458, 'text': 'Thank you for your appreciation !\nSee you again soon.\nSincerely'}</response>< gmapID>

We have enjoyed dinning at Le Vallauris numerous times.  When we decided to get married this was the obvious choice for the venue.  As always the food was absolutely delicious and the presentation was beautiful.  The service was impeccable.  The management, bartenders and wait staff did everything possible to provide the highest level of service - they surpassed our expectations.  The atmosphere is truly stunning.  Due to the food, staff and restaurant, this was a remarkable experience – it could not have been any better.   We look forward to returning often.</Text>

<Rate>1< /Rate><Review>Very disappointed in our treatment by the maitre d'. We called a month ahead and switched a previous reservation to Sat night during Christmas weekend. When we called they said they could only seat us at 5:45 which is earlier than we preferred, but we agreed. When we arrived, they did not have our reservation. We were among the first patrons but they said they had no room to seat us the garden and put us in an empty room that never filled up, nor did the garden. The food was good, service was slow. Owner offered to move us out to the garden after 2 hours but too little, too late. $500 meal for condescending treatment - shame on them .< /Review>< Response>

<Review>A very good, though pricy restaurant. The patio setting is spectacular. The food was pretty good though I wouldn't say excellent. I suspected a real foodie might even call it mediocre. I'd probably give it about a 7 out of 10. But given the setting I still recommend it for a special night out.</Review><pics>None< /pics><Rate>4</Rate><user_name>Ted Inoue< /user_name><UserId.>110204891685770336136<//UserId.>< Time>

This place was very busy in the morning with a different menu so we tried it at dinner with reservations. The location is great with street parking and the restaurant interior is very cozy and comfy with earthy tones and good light fixtures, very modern. We ordered the sweet soy sauce fried chicken KFC which was really good. We also ordered the bulgogi fried rice and beef burrito k. The bulgogi fried rice was okay but I felt it was soy sauce rice with frozen vegetables and then the beef being added on top and not seasoned too well. The burrito k was good with fries but a little strong with the raw onions. Service was impeccable and attentive and quick.<//review>

After a disappointing start, Le Vallauris ended up being a very fine dinner with excellent service. Our 7:45 pm reservation turned into an 8:15 seating at the table next to the servers' door to the kitchen.  But staff & the maitre de made up for it with solid attention to our meal &
requests & a closing glass of champagne.  A classy, high cuisine restaurant it continues to be.</text>

Excellent food and well worth it! My husband and I came here last night and this place has the most enchanting atmosphere! Service was very good as well but I give it a 4 star though since we had several people come and ask how everything was but not one of them looked at me and asked. I found it to be rude even though it didn't seem intentional but everyone should be recognized at the table, not just the men and since I am the one who also will decide if we will go again.<//review>

<Review>I'm still scratching my head and trying to understand how they received a 4.6 rating????  Ambiance="A" We sat out back in a patio setting filled with interesting trees. Appetizers="D" The mushroom tarte must have been frozen and then microwaved to order. The octopus came with a chorizo "leather" that was not very appealing. Entrees="D" & "B" The lobster ravioli pasta was about as thick as the chorizo leather. The lobster ravioli sauce was lacking flavor and any depth. I had the sea bass and it was good. Properly cooked piece of fish with a decent sauce. For entertainment value, you must engage with the "somelier" Bruce, it will be self explanatory. Hands down, one of the most leading reviews I've seen on Google. We would not return to Le Vallauris if the meal was free.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>We lunched there the Monday after Thanksgiving, so it was sparsely populated, and we got to sit anywhere we liked in their gorgeous courtyard. The service was wonderfully friendly and unpretentious, especially since we were dressed in hiking gear.

I tried the boar pâté, which was decent, and the hangar steak which was fantastic. Would probably eat here again.< /Review>< Pics>

Where to begin? I had heard nothing but great things about this French restaurant. I was really excited to enjoy amazing food with 4 of my best friends on the last day of the year. We were lucky to get a reservation (we thought) and our taste buds would be exploding with amazing flavors.
From the moment we walked in, we were met with an overcrowded entrance/lobby which was surprising to me. I thought we had a reservation to start enjoying dinner at 845. Instead, we were moved into the bar area where a band was setting up and a dance floor, which was overcrowded with others waiting to be seated as well.
We had to seek someone out from the restaurant in order to get a table after waiting almost an hour. That is not what you expect from an upscale locale. Once seated, we were surprised to discover that there was a pre-fixe menu with a cost of $160 per person. Having prior fine dining experience I wasn’t thrown off by the price, as long as the food was up to par.
After placing our orders we each enjoyed our appetizers and the excitement was increasing for me, a great meal was about to be enjoyed.
That’s where it went all wrong. Our waitress and her assistant started putting spoons out as cutlery for our next dish. We thought perhaps a pleasant surprise was in store, perhaps a nice French bisque soup or something exciting.
Instead, our deserts were brought out. We all stopped the waitress and let her know we had yet to receive our main dishes. I had ordered the Branzino however when it came, I smelled it and immediately knew it had sat too long or was not fresh. We asked if we could exchange it for another item. We were able to exchange it for the lobster.
Sadly, the lobster (3 of which where ordered by our table) was cold. That is unacceptable in a restaurant of this caliber. I took one or two bites and just left it, I was not about to go down that slippery slope of suffering through a bad dish. My other friend ordered chateaubriand and she was also surprised at the coldness of the temperature. Now I was upset that the restaurant we had been looking forward to all weekend was underdelivering on expectations.
The meal ended with a subpar dessert, in which the main waitress had to correct the direction of the placement of the dessert.
Before leaving I requested to speak with the manager, which never happened. Instead, we were given the on lobster off at market price ($48). I did make a call the following day and spoke with the manager, who let the owner know and he would be calling me back.
The result of the call was as follows: nobody else complained about the evening and the pre-fixe price included entertainment (band), dancing and party favors. They don’t like to rush people so if we were expecting to be in and out they apologize for that experience. However, they have been having this event for the past 45 years. I guess we should know their history, despite this being our very first visit to the restaurant. He was unwilling to credit or offer a discount for our experience (nearly a $900 meal) but rather offer a complimentary bottle of champagne upon our next visit.
No thank you, this place is dated and the way things are dealt with in a service industry that relies on reputation lets me know that we are not the caliber of diners they host. I sure wish I had a different experience. I will let any person who asks about this restaurant to steer way clear.
Not impressed, extremely underwhelmed and absolutely offended.<//Review>

Visited this restaurant after reading positive reviews, however our experience was negative. Greeted by a maitre d' with a sense of humour bypass. Shown to a table crammed in between other diners when most of the restaurant was empty, then moved to another table after we declined the cramming. Were served a bottle of water and some bread and were then forgotten despite there being more waiters than clientele. We weren't even shown a menu. After waiting 15 minutes, we paid for our water, explained why we were leaving to shrugs 'who cares' from the miserable maitre d' and left.< /Text>

Le Vallauris Restaurant, has a vigerious and detrimend staff. Starting with the Valet, which are owned and operated by a woman but extends her twin sister and her father as her main employees. They are there every day except in July and August when the season is closed due to hot temperatures. The hoast when you come in are very nice, welcoming, and make sure you are seated right away along with your guest. The waiter and buss boys were great. The only thing that was not right, was when we received our drinks.we waited for up to 10 minutes to get an ice tea. This was up setting, due to the fact that we cheer our hoast whom is picking up the bill and to our veterans. Overall, the food was very delicious , well proportion you , and had a great ambience.< /review>

<Review>I have been introduced to the restaurant and to Paul and Omar in 2005. Whenever in Palm Springs I make it a destination at least to eat there once. Two years ago my fiancé went with me for the first time and for both of us traveling to many place in Europe, Le Vallarius has the most exquisite food, superb service, a wine selection out of this world, the most romantic ambiance and Paul and Omar are the hosts with most gentlemanly manners.
Looking very much forward to start the New Year there with a fabulous dinner again and to celebrate it with our friends.

<Rate>2< /Rate><Text>We received a gift certificate worth $150 towards what we thought would be a fine dining experience at Le Vallauris. Note, onsite parking is very limited, with "valet" service available, we opted for street parking and walked the few steps to the front door.

Our host must've been tired - his less than enthusiastic greeting, coupled with a mechanical "follow me", made us think back to a crabby greeter at a Denny's  (apologies to Denny's). With no eye contact, he mumbled something unintelligible, weaving his way towards the back patio seating area.

Plenty of seating for two was available, but despite being well-dressed we felt like our back wall seating missed the mark (see photos).

A magic marker style menu on an easel was plopped down with scribbled specials (no notes re accompaniments or sides), followed by a fixed price, two choice menu. Passed on that.

Our waitress was cheerful and attentive but somehow a couple that showed up after us received their appetizers first.

We shared the escargot, my wife had a delicious and well-prepared filet mignon $43.00, I had the passable .5lb (after shelling) sautéed lobster $48.00. A half-ish glass of red or white wine will set you back $14 - $18 each. Various meh greens on a bed of doughy something finished the plating.

Sadly, Le Vallauris has probably seen better days - indicated by the faded TripAdvisor and other gradings posted at the front entrance.

Tucked away in a vintage residential area, the eateries on Palm Canyon, a couple of blocks away, might provide more for a gift certificate.</Text><username>xfirehurican<//username>< Response>

<Text>If you want a place where you can buy just about any Cuban food product this is the place.HOWEVER, beware!! This place uses that very ancient system of charging. The put a very flimsy little sticker on the products with the price of the item. When the cashier begins to charge you, they add cents and even dollars to the item. For example an item has that little sticker for $2.49 but the cashiers types in, very fast mind you, $2.99. On a large purchase, this adds up to dollars in total. If they notice that you are trusting and not even paying attention, like me, they really stick it to you...!

Just now I arrived home from a purchase with them, wondering why my bill was so high. Every time I go there my bill is way higher than I guesstimated. I mean way higher. Finally I became suspicious, something that I never do. I checked my itemized bill against all the products purchased. And indeed...! They had over charged me $12.53, using the very method I explained above. And I guess this dude at the register really saw me gullible, because he rang up an item for $7.99. The highest price item I purchased was suppose to be only $5.49.

Also, watch out with the expiration dates, especially items in the freezer. Like the "croquettas," just about all of them have no expiration date. This is a major violation with the U.S. Department of Health. Always reach for items in the very back of the freezer.

I highly recommend when you go buy there, bring a calculator with you. And as you put items in your cart, add them up. If an item does not have a price on it, ask! Don't trust them! Believe me, these type of people have a history in Cuba... and is not a good one. They are shady crooks!< /Text>< Pictures>

It's small neighborhood market that must be doing something right because it seems it's always busy so that creates a parking issue since there's no enough spaces. You can find some produce at really bargain prices but some others seem to be excessively mark up.<//text>

<review>All cuban products that you need you can buy here,  from Spain too.  But store is small and too crowded. But worth it since it's the best selection of Cuban and Spanish commodities you'll fiend in one place.< /review>< username>

This is about the only market left to find Cuban products
and also products from Spain, I have always found the meat
to be fresh.  The owner is friendly and is a pleasure to shop here.</text>

<Review>Carne asada is why I come here. They have other great meats. I love the Yam or sweet potato candy at the 2nd register in the liquer department. Cuban food and other SPANISH fruits and veggies. Soda from many countries. The biggest avacodos.< /Review>< pictures>

<time>1449853365417<//time><Rating>5< /Rating><text>I go to el Mambí to get my Spanish and Cuban products. They are always well stocked with all you need to make everything from a Cuban arroz con pollo to a Caldo gallego!
In addition, when you get there they always greet you with a polite "buenos días", "buenas tardes".
They make you feel welcome. It's as been in a small pueblo in Spain. This little market is a jewel of our culture, in Glendale.< /text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Carne asada is average like any other Latino store. Service from the cashier is Very rude. She needs to remember if she does not like her job, don't take it out on her clients!! 😤 Very disappointed!!😞< /Review>

Since starting school at UCSC, I’ve been a regular here along with friends. The staff work so hard and send out meals as soon as they can. So far, I’ve enjoyed all of the meals I’ve ordered (my family is Chinese and we frequently eat home cooked Chinese food, so I’ll vouch for the decency of this Chinese takeout). They also have plenty of vegan options that are just as delicious as the other menu items. The veggie buns are a must (vegans or non vegans!)! Fluffy with a perfect mushroom filling. One time I accidentally ordered something incorrectly and the owner quickly made me a new batch with no charge at closing time (even though I tried my best to pay), which I am extremely grateful for. They make me want to order from them because they treat their customers well and I trust them to always give a quality meal! Food is also great when packaged for takeout. They separate the sauce from some dishes to prevent sogginess so I can reheat it at home. Definitely worth a try! Especially now, takeout is crucial for these restaurants. Support the community if you can!< /Text>

<Text>I loved it! This is the first restaurant that I have gone to that has shown pictures on pretty much everything in the menu, so I don't just have to guess what it is I chose to eat and the amount that I would get. The food was absolutely delicious and the price was decent when compared to the amount we were given. I 100% recommend eating here!</Text>< Pics>

<Text>I treated myself to take out, which I've rarely done since COVID. I was terribly disappointed with the simple mixed vegetable dish I got. Besides tasting like an old can, some of the mushrooms were difficult to chew (rubbery) and I discarded them along with the canned veggies that tasted like metal. I choked the rest of it down since I was hungry and had already paid for it. I've enjoyed their food in the past. Something has changed for the worse, and I won't be returning.</Text>< pictures>

< Review>
I took a chance and ordered online delivery for my first meal with Shun Feng. I ordered cucumber salad, soup dumplings, mu shu shrimp and shrimp shu mai. Firstly, it took them MAYBE 20 minutes from the time I ordered to when the deliver guy showed up at my door, so that was cool. But also, they left me a note on my order that I was outside their normal delivery zone (the website still let me??) but to please pick up next time. I thought that was so nice of them!! Now on to the food... The cucumber salad was delicious, the soup dumplings were decent (probably not the best choice for delivery on my part since they were luke warm upon arrival and I tried to steam them again, poor idea), shrimp shu mai was pretty standard but guys, the mu shu shrimp was the star here. I have never had such fresh mu shu! I was expecting it to be oily, soaked in sauce, mushy but tasty (aka a standard Chinese takeout mu shu) but instead the cabbage was tender, the shrimp were plump and there was no sopping sauce, just a perfect amount of delicate broth! I have tried three other Chinese restaurants here in the area and I can honestly say Shun Feng is at the top. I am currently reordering for dinner right now! But for pick up ;)

Review edit - the Wor Wonton soup is the best wonton soup I’ve ever had. It is so flavorful and comforting. I will be back for more as these days get cooler!!</Review>

<review>The food at this restaurant is truly excellent. I‘ve been eating Chinese food for years and was super super happy to find such a great place moving into the new area. On TOP of that, I just went back for my second time and they told me that the online site (not their own site or any mistake on their end) we had ordered through overcharged us the last time that we we came, so they noted my phone number and the amount I had been overcharged (I had no idea) and told me this when I showed up next, cutting it all off of my bill for this new food order. I was absolutely blown away that they remembered that and gave me the discount just by me calling in with my number again. Not only do they make amazing food but they have AMAZING business practices. Will surely be returning!<//review>< Pictures>

Don't buy anything from this restaurant. I ordered scallops and prawns and got 1 scallop and 3 small shrimp not Prawns and mostly vegetables, I also bought fish and got 4 very small pieces of rubbery fish and mostly vegetables. The hose special chow main had 1 shrimp 1 chicken 2 beef all noodles no vegetables and was very greasy.  Horrible food don't go there!<//text>

<review>I’m not a person that normally complains or tries to give restaurants a hard time but this time I had to leave a review. I just ordered take out from this restaurant. The staff was very friendly, the food was ready quickly, and I even left a tip but when I got the food I could barely eat half of it. I ordered the general tso’s chicken and it was just a container of fried chicken and another container of sweet and sour sauce with vinegar. When we asked them about it all they said was “that’s how we make it here”. In my previous experiences I’ve never had general tso’s chicken like that and it was disgusting. Secondly, I ordered the cream cheese wontons and they were utterly tasteless and not enjoyable at all. I will not be eating here again. Just a fair warning. I tried saying to my self just be grateful that to have food but this was just a waste of $25.< /review><rating>1<//rating><user>116592063369614488221</user>< name>

< Review>
While the service was fast, my vegetables were virtually raw and my shrimp had a disturbingly mushy texture coupled with an awful, fishy taste. The corn in our veggies also had an off texture, was grayish in color, and tasted like an old can. We also had the salad (a giant piece of lettuce with this clear, thin, super sweet and oddly sour 'dressing') and soup of the day, hot and sour soup, and it had nasty canned peas in it.
Everything was dirty. My fork had caked on, old and dry food, my cup also had some black things stuck to the inside, and there were bits of hardened rice under the lip of my plate.
There was no filter for the tea that we ordered, so we were having to pick out sticks and leaves every time we poured a cup.
Seaweed was mixed into all of the vegetables, which, while it's not necessarily a complaint, for the dishes we ordered it was odd. Chopsticks weren't offered to us either, which was something I noticed about the few other white appearing families in the restaurant as well. Asian customers were all offered chopsticks to eat with, while all the white customers were handed forks without even a question. This isn't the worst thing in the world and maybe I should have asked, but it felt like there were assumptions being made and that made me uncomfortable.
And last but not least, I felt we were being rushed to leave from the moment we sat down. We were being checked on way too much to see if we were done with our plates yet, and they brought us our check before we had even finished.
Perhaps we came on an off day, but it was truly an unpleasant and unenjoyable experience for me, unfortunately, and this is not a restaurant I'll be eager to return to.</Review>

Their menu says they deliver order of $25 within 3 miles. While when I tried to order, they said I have to order $35. My address is absolutely within 3 miles (2.3 mile according to Google map). And they gave no reason for this, even didn't apologize. Bad service.

Their food is not good either - especially dry and flavorless rice. The only reason I wanted to order was they deliver. Now I have no reason.<//Review>

Every time we travel and stop in santa Cruz.  We have a lunch or a dinner at this place. The food is comforting and pleasant. The taste is not that greasy and not that salty. A fast decent place to eat when you can't find something else open. They are also very friendly and affordable plates. Many   veggie place to choose from as well. Great location on a shopping center to look around.<//Text>

Ordered take out. When I got back to my hotel, opened the bag and was highly disappointed! Boxes of dry, over crusted bread pieces. Barely any chicken in the boxes. The sauce was open and spilled all over the other boxes. There was no forks or napkins and the egg rolls were soggy! Disgusting food. Terrible service.</review>

<text>This place is perfectly fine. It has a big menu and a good selection of multi course combo dinners. There are options, but not always exactly in the combinations you want on the predetermined dinners. The prices are fine but not an especially good value. The service is always fast and nice and the portions are pretty big. So it's definitely not the best Chinese food I've ever had but it's still good<//text>< Time>

I ordered sweet and sour chicken in a combo plate. The meat was extremely dry and impossible to chew through. None the less I tried to make the best of it--only to end up with foods poisoning. Had eaten nothing else within the incubation period for this, so this is where I got it!! Ugh! The first time ever, as fast as I've ever officially known, that I have ever contracted food poisoning.< /text>

I wanted to try someplace new and this restaurant was recommended to me.   This type of food is new to me.  The appetizer I ordered was a plate of lettuce, a plate that had a large fried egg filled with vegetables,  and a bowl to dip in.  I had never seen anything like it and had to ask how to eat it.  The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was delicious.</text>

<Text>Came here on the 4TH  and enjoyed the food. We got the single person combos and were very pleased with the portions. The staff were very kind to us and we like smiles and they smiled plenty.
If we ever come to Santa Cruz for a getaway again, we will keep this place in  mind for a bit of good food.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Text>3 to 3.5. Service is prompt and minimalist. They are kind and do say thank you. Now the more important part, the food. It's good but not great. I had dumplings and the hunan beef. Pot stickers innards were bland, human beef wasn't crispy enough. It's like they're almost there but not quite hitting that great mark. Coupled with the reasonable pricing though,  it's an all around good deal. I will go back.<//Text>< Rating>

I've only been to this restaurant twice, but the first time my family and I tried it, we knew we had to come back when we visit Santa Cruz again. It was a charm the first and second time.  We will definitely be back for the third charm.< /review>

< Review>
Best Chinese food. Fresh, not oily. Wonderful staff, very friendly. Don't know where Meghan and Julian ate, but hard to believe it was here. Owned by a wonderful family that has always gone out of their way to please us. Frozen? Not in the 6+ years we have have been eating with the current and previous owners.
As far as the positive reviews being fake, nonsense. We have enjoyed Shun Feng since they opened in Felton. We have been through an ownership change, where the previous owner stayed on to train/help the current owners get situated. The current owners have maintained the high standards they started with. If there is any "fake" reviews, look at the percentages. Sounds more like underhanded competitors. Rather than knock your competition, up your game.< /Review>

Their food was pretty okay, but my partner and I didn't really like the orange chicken, it was a little bland and seemed a teeny bit undercooked. But when we asked if they could take it back they did, and removed it off the bill which was nice. Other than that the main area was clean, bathrooms were okay.<//review>

I have had lunch here many times when I only have 30 minutes and the food is super fast yet hot and excellent. They will also add whatever meat you would like added to your dish. They make an eggplant with garlic sauce that isn't very spicy but excellent in flavor and includes quite a bit of that wood ear mushroom(which satisfies me).<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Horrible food, the reviews are all fake! I ordered. Mongolian beef and they brought me a bunch of sautéed vegetables with hardly any meat. They cooked it in like 2 minutes. Beware of this place! I ended up going for a pizza after leaving $30 here< /text>

Good food, good service. Also offers takeout. Sometimes there can be a wait of 10 minutes or so to be seated during their peak times.</text>

<Date>1546297996025<//Date><review>I definitely recommend this place! My fiance and I were looking for a place that served vegan options and Shun Feng offers quite a few! I ordered the vegi-chicken with eggplant in Sezchuan sauce with an order of Chinese green onion pancakes. My fiance ordered sesame chicken with chicken fried rice. He said it was the best Chinese food he'd ever had and I agree completely! My vegan meal was absolutely delicious!! The staff were very friendly too!🙂</review>< name>

Everything I've eaten here is delicious! Top quality food, the best Chinese in Santa Cruz--I haven't tried ALL of the restaurants but I have tried a LOT of them and their food all pales in comparison for sure. They make the best chicken fried rice I've ever eaten, and I highly recommend the Sizzling Clay Pot of Peppered Chicken with Chef's Sauce....it makes my mouth water just thinking about it! A nicely decorated and very clean place, always a plus.</Text>

It's ok. Not used to the way they cook and nothing stood out to me as far as taste. Tried their Kung Pou dish and I was not a fan of their style of sauce used. It's a no frills Chinese restaurant -- but to their credit they do serve mock-meats for the vegetarian taste-buds. It could be just me and I go by taste only... but they did have a good turnout of customers the night  I was there.<//text>

<review>Service is great and the food is delicious with a fantastic portion. The three dinner specials are amazing. You get some variety for a great price, and it is usually enough food to split with two people (but it will depend on the people). I highly recommend and have already gone back several times.</review>< pics>

The foods pretty good. They have a traditional chinese menu and cook it to the liking of my chinese friends. They also have an american chinese menu if you're looking for sweet n sour chicken etc. The price isn't bad at all considering how much food is in santa cruz< /Review>

Shun Feng might be the best Chinese restaurant in Santa Cruz. We had Wor Wonton Soup, Singapore Noodles and Beef and Asparagus. The beef dish lacked flavor, but the veggies and meat were fresh and well-cooked. The soup and noodles were spot on! We'll be back!</Text>

<Review>Lunch specials are a deliciously good deal. You pick an entree item that comes with rice (excluding chow mein meals) and you get soup and salad beforehand. The staff are super nice! The garlic chicken chow mein is so yummy. My favorite Chinese restaurant in Santa Cruz by far.<//Review>< time>

<Gmap_id>0x808e4030f9749301:0xfa816c089902aaa2<//Gmap_id><text>Shun Feng is a traditional family-style Chinese restaurant, complete with spinning center piece tables and all. I've been to a lot of Chinese restaurants all over the bay area, and this is definitely one of my favorites. Large menu with tons of options, and it's not too confusing (some pictures in the back) like some Asian restaurants can be. The food itself is served fresh and hot. Hunan beef, lemon or orange chicken, and honey walnut shrimp with house fried rice or wanton soup is always my go to. The meat is crispy and cooked well done, the sauce is great and the vegetables in the plates are a nice touch. I'm not a big fan of dim som, but my party usually orders it, and the bread is fluffy and moist. I usually even end up ordering some of the sesame balls with the sweet red paste filling as a dessert. Also very crispy, hot, and tasty. Its all moderately priced, so expect about 20-30$ for about two people (depending on how hungry you are.) All in all, the food here is great and the staff is friendly and quick. I haven't been to a better Asian restaurant in Santa Cruz. Shen Fung is my go-to for a dinner out with friends.<//text>< rate>

The food was near unpalatable - definitely purchased frozen. When I tried to return the dish, they refused to do so (despite having taken only one bite).

The manager was very rude about the situation, I would avoid as there are plenty of better places within walking distance.<//review>

<Rate>2< /Rate><Review>Seemed great at first taste, and was so excited to find a decent chinese food place in santa cruz but then i cut into a walnut prawn and it was grey...and not de-veined...and then the beef wonton was either not wrapped correctly or the beef was just falling apart maybe overcooked? Very disappointed, even their sweet and sour chicken was too thick and bready the ratio of chicken there was awful. The Wor Wont Ton soup was to sketchy  for me as i detailed the prior shrimp concern and the chicken was too chewy just a big fat disappointment. Spent $50 and wish i had gone elsewhere...staff is friendly and delivery was quick/on time= the only plus...<//Review>< Pictures>

I go to this superb place often because I enjoy the ambiance that is characterizes this restaurant. The team is very welcoming and qualified. The service is extraordinarily fast. Most important, the food you eat is first-rate. I visited more than once and I was always happy. The pay is decent. I recommend this restaurant to to everybody.</text>

<review>Amazing service! They brought our takeout food all the way to the car even though it was not at all expected. The gluten free pancakes with added chocolate pieces were pretty good as well. You can now eat outside but there’s construction going on so it’s not that enjoyable. They also offer a few $6 meals between 2-10 pm everyday! And have a 20% off coupon with the code IHOP 20.<//review>< Pictures>

They served us with used dirty cups, during a pandemic this is ESPECIALLY unacceptable. The tables were sticky and the food was mediocre, but that was about what I expected. Messed up multiple parts of the order as well.</review>

<Text>Every time I go to IHOP on Angus and El Camino Real in San Bruno, the waiting time for seating  isn't bad at all(10mins top). The services are not for me to complain of especially when it comes down about the food and how it's prepped..I leave nothing but empty plates and a $10 gratuity after handling my inexpensive bill and happy I leave!<//Text><Rate>5</Rate>< user_id>

Waitress kept forgetting us. We were right in the middle of the floor but she kept passing us. Had to keep yelling, EXCUSE ME, to get her attention. I felt dumb lol. Food was good but took forever to come out. Literally just ordered eggs and pancakes.<//Review>

I like the old school vibe and you can chill to live jazz in the lounge/bar.  I have never had a bad steak here and the lobster bisque is exceptional.  The seafood is decent too and the waitstaff is excellent.</Review>

I ordered a French Toast Breakfast combo. It was a wholesome meal. French toasts were really soft and fluffy. Hash browns were really good. The other person with me ordered pancakes, and they were great too.</text>< Pics>

Compared to the last IHOP I visited, this one was much smaller. However, it's IHOP, it had the same menu as the previous one I visited in LA and the food was of similar satisfying quality.

The meal I had was something called bacon crusted chicken which consisted of bacon (obviously), cheese, potatoes, chicken (again, obviously!) and hollandaise sauce. It was very tasty!</Text>

I ordered a meal to pick up. I went inside to pick up the order. The host told me to wait outside in a very rude way. Then I looked in the glass door and saw the cook was letting her nose hang out of her mask while cooking. I called my wife and told her...she said cancel the order.

BE CAREFUL EATING HERE. MAKE SURE THEY ARE FOLLOWING THE COVID 19 PROTOCALS FOR THE SAFETY OF THEIR CUSTOMERS, NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES!<//text>

As much as I luv pancakes 🥞, I was disappointed with the service. They said 10 mins for a table & we waited 1/2 hour... I even burned my arm. We sat outside & we flagged 3 ladies to take our order. Took about 20 mins to take our order. Plus having to ask 3 times to get our water glasses🥤 was a bit much...

When I get bad service, it’s really hard to enjoy food. Without water refill, I felt like I was choking.

The real kicker of this is that it was my boyfriend’s birthday and it started horrible with bad service at IHOP...< /Review>

The food was great and quite affordable. They are doing a good job in maintaining the cleanliness of the restaurant moreover now because of the pandemic. They have assigned seats and tables to comply with the social distancing requirement.<//review>

<Review>Came in after 8 so I can't blame them entirely, for not having any S&P shakers on the tables cuz they were all being washed.The restaurant was slow, but it seemed like a good place to get a late dinner. There were just a few people on staff and only a few customers in at this time.

I ordered a 55+ dinner of chicken fried steak and a green salad (cuz there was no soup), and I asked what came on it was told only tomato & red onion. I asked if there were any cucumbers I could but no. I conceded to ask for extra tomato, to which she complied. I asked about salad dressing and there were only 2 kinds & none of which was my preference... Blue Cheese. (I settled for Ranch on the side).

When the salad came tho, there were lots of RINGS of red onion laying on top & lots of bright red tomato wedges, which was really great to have. I did have to ask for a side plate so I could cut up the onions & cut the tomatoes smaller. I then asked if there were any croutons, expecting the answer would be "no" since they weren't on the salad already, but my server said there were, and she brought me a BAGGIE of croutons! LOL

The dinner arrived before I could finish my salad unfortunately, so I pushed away the side of cold food in lieu of the hot food that had just arrived. I opted to order it with a side of something called "red potato hash" instead of mashed potatoes (cuz mashed were powdered from a box). they brought me a side and gravy because I had asked for greeting to be put on top of it and it wasn't which was fine. The broccoli that I had was rather cold, but the chicken fried steak was huge! It was overcooked for my taste but I just finished half of it.

All in all, I guess it was an OK dinner for being here at IHOP because I was hungry oh, but I probably won't be back due to the limited selection they have on the 55+ dinner menu. One can't expect to have 5-star service necessarily in this type of establishment. It is what it is...& it filled the gut!< /Review>< user_name>

<review>Food was alright but environment was tense. We heard arguing between the staff. When we were ordering, she was walking away while we still wanted to order more. Felt like we had to yell our order to her because she was in such a rush (restaurant was slow). We ordered coffee and hot chocolate, server brought creamer for the coffee but she said she did not hear us say we wanted coffee. So what was the creamer for? I wanted another hot chocolate to eat with the rest of my meal (which they charge for another cup of hot chocolate fyi) and I was never brought the second hot chocolate but was charged for it. The restaurant was not full at all.< /review><resp>None< /resp><user>111517597698662495755<//user></record>

Ordered online, picked up- no problems whatsoever. Food was great (consistent with the IHOP I've known my whole life, which is important to me!). They got my group's breakfast cooked and ready in about 20 min. Been there a few times now because it's quick, easy, and delicious. Had a gluten-free person with us too, and even though they can't guarantee no cross-contamination by nature of their workflow, her Celiac's didn't flare up, so I'm thankful for the caution they still put into her meal.</review>

<Review>Food was pretty good as usual. However, one of the waiters didn’t let my brother charge on battery that was much needed for our time in SF. That is also part of the service and we felt it no complying with such simple thing affects their review.< /Review><date>1577687277103</date></record>

<text>Very unprofessional waiters.  Gave us receipt before we even asked for it telling us to hurry up and didn't give us our water until we  asked her again. Paola was also taking tips off tables she didn't even serve food. Will not come back. Alicia was the server very rude! Food was wrong I ordered gluten free pancakes and got regular pancakes! I'm allergic to wheat and I get this! I will not come back!</text><username>German Avila<//username>< Time>

This is a great place if you want a quick and delicious breakfast (or brunch) if you are really tired when you just woke up. Great views and great service this is a must go if you are in South San Franscisco.< /text>

Be careful when ordering online. They WILL give your food away to someone else. It happened to me 3 times in a row, and I don’t even eat there that often. 2 stars because the food itself was ok.

I hope whoever picked up my order enjoyed the burger....</Text>

The service was bad at this location. Felt animosity between the workers and management.<//text><time>1579458870101<//time><Gmap_id>0x808f79d9ee81dd73:0xa3304f8625faf0b6</Gmap_id>< userid>

<review>Very unprofessional management that prizes profit over any customer service. There were 6 groups waiting and over 6 tables / booths open. But they were not seating anyone as they were only catering to online orders from UberEats and DoorDash. Avoid unless you want terrible service.< /review><Response>None<//Response><time>1574533020135< /time><rating>1<//rating><Pics>None<//Pics><user_id>107465264125007287458<//user_id></record>

IHOP isn't really the place to go if you're vegan. But if you're visiting your grandparents and they want to go to IHOP, then you can do an online search for what's vegan at IHOP and find a few options. I ended up with steamed broccoli and potato, which was just fine with ketchup. You know, whatever keeps the grandparents smiling, right?< /Review>

<Review>The waitress we had was really lousy.  She skipped our table numerous times when we were trying to grab her attention.  It took our waitress literally 15-20 minutes to come back to our table and check how we were doing.  She forgot multiple condiments and such that we requested. She even forgot to split the order and had us go up to the cashier and fix it.
I feel for some reason the waitress just didn't like my friend and I from the start.  No idea why.  She was more than friendly to the table behind and around us,   but for us?  It was as if we didn't exist.  Calling her effort the minimal possible would be a compliment.

The food was decent,  but the seating was kind of uncomfortable because of our pretty lousy experience with the waitress.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

The food here is ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! !!The menu looks great but I was with 5 ppl and we all hated it! My Swedish Crepes tasted like no joke--CARDBOARD!! The older server literally ignored me to the point that I had to walk up to her hiding in the kitchen to tell her that we ALL wanted to LEAVE. NEVER AGAIN....I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS PLACE IS STILL HERE!</text>

They have a sign on the wall that days to make sure that items are covered in your car but it should day don't leave them in your car. Another guest had all her luggage stolen. The cops came and said this is a thing for this area so everyone is aware of this issue. The service and food were good it just was a bad experience because it's a bar neighborhood. My son was devastated to lose his stuff. Wouldn't want this to happen to anyone else. They target rentals the cops said.  If you have VALUABLES FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE.

< review>
Just left the IHOP at 5AM this morning. After entering unoticed and being stared at by some vagrant or possible staff member in the corner seated I finally was noticed by Oscar. I said " just one" followed by "good morning". He grumbled at me then walk a couple of steps then threw the menu on the table. I told Oscar that I changed my mind and left the establishment. The end</review>

<review>Parking: Medium-sized lot that can fill up fast on the weekends.

Decor: Your bland corporate diner booths. Not very roomy. Overhead hanging light is too bright. At least it's clean.

Food: Very middle of the road. The omelette was quite bland, had to add quite a bit of Cholula sauce to get any kind of flavor. The pancake slider felt heavy and boring after the first one. The buttermilk pancakes were large and chewy but otherwise forgettable. The mixed fruits was fresh enough but there wasn't much of it.

Felt overpriced for what you get, especially for a chain franchise.

All in all, you should go to one of the many better options nearby, like Millbrae Pancake House.</review>< pictures>

Not impressed at all. Waitress continuously forgot our orders, there was lipstick left on my coffee cup from the previous user. Disgusting! Was not happy with their service.<//text>

We waited for the food for 20+ minutes and when the food arrived, half of it was cold and half of it was warm. The waitress was giving us an attitude the whole time, and won't explain to us about the all u can eat. She just said u get lots of pancakes. We noticed she was less impatient with the other table. However she was very quick when we were almost done, we were very unhappy about that. We stayed there as long as the table next to us so I don't know if it was a cheap move to order all u can eat or asking her about the menu since we don't eat pancake very often. We don't want to go there again. Any other restaurant will offer better food and service.<//text>

One of my favorite all-time IHOPs anywhere in the country, and definitely best I've been to in Bay Area.  This location is in one  of the iconic IHOP blue peak-roof buildings, not one of the newer, plain jane ones, so immediately it's special.  Bright interior.  Serving staff -- at least at night when I usually go -- are awesome, especially Oscar.  Food is better here than the other IHOPs in South SF and Daly City -- good chef.  Again, I'm talking about night crew, never been here daytime.  Also, this location is open 24 hours on Fri & Sat nite, which is a big plus for me.</review>

<response>None<//response><Rating>3< /Rating><Review>(Translated by Google) I live close to the area and sometimes I have to go to dinner at this place (it may be that you have a good staff on duty and a cook dedicated to their work and it is one of those days that you decide to return). Today 11/13/2020 I had the experience of arriving past 6:30 It was a cool night with little rain, I parked my car and proceeded to request a table, a waiter sat me at the available table (for a change there were no more customers sitting, just me), but what there was was a cook 👩🏿‍🍳 with a reggaeton at full volume and well intoned to be sung (and the presentation of the food passed to the last term, the important thing was to turn up the volume and speak bad things from his other colleagues from the previous shift, which makes me so unpleasant, there was a person who seemed to be the leader on duty and only the Reia from the words of the cook and him without putting a stop and out of respect for me) in the For the time that I was there I could hear from reggaeton, band, bachata, cumbia and she changed the music as well as cooked! I could add more things but I would ask that the people who work in this establishment be more dedicated to their activities, as well as teach them to cook 🧑‍🍳!

Hoy 11/13/2020 tuve la experiencia de llegar pasando las 6:30 Era una noche fresca y con poca lluvia, estacioné mi auto y procedí a solicitar una mesa, un mesero me sentó en la mesa disponible ( para variar no había más clientes sentados, solo yo), pero lo que sí había era una cocinera 👩🏿‍🍳 con un regueton a todo volumen y bien entonada para estar cantado ( y la presentación de la comida pasaba al último término lo importante era subir el volumen y hablar malas cosas de sus otros compañeros del turno anterior cosa que se me hace tan desagradable, había una persona alparecer era el líder en turno y solo el Reia de las palabras de la cocinera y el sin poner un alto y por respeto a mi persona) en el tiempo que estuve pude oír desde regueton, banda, bachata, cumbia y ella cambiaba la música así como cocinaba! Pudiera agregar más cosas pero si pediría que las personas que trabajan en este establecimiento sean más entregadas a sus actividades, así como enseñarles a cocinar 🧑‍🍳!</Review><user>105407422607483737058</user></record></dataset><record>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Always good to go to an IHOP, you know what to expect. You have a wide menu and more deals like pancakes. The difficulty will be choosing what to eat and knowing how much coffee you can take.

(Translated by Google) This service was the worst. I ordered three-milk pancakes, they gave me regular and charged me three milks. This is the second time I ask for shake and they didn't sell me. He was the same waiter and his name is Oscar. How will it be possible for them not to have to sell. Pity really service ...
