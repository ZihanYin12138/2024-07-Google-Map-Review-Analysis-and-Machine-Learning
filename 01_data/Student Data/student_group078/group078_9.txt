I came in for a quick visit and met so many REALLY genuine people here.  I'm working on learning basic crossfit and how to do the rope climb. The normal members that come to this gym are SUCH nice people.  They saw me struggling and stopped to give me tips and to help me learn. I was scaling the rope (poorly, but could climb it) by the time I walked out of the facility 40 minutes later.  Clean, lots of state of the art, top end equipment, spacious, and a great / friendly staff.  Would highly recommend dropping in and checking them out.  WELL worth the stop.  Thank you guys so much!</text>

I have been going to Crossfit Tustin for almost three years now, and I love everything about it. The people are all top notch, the programming is on point, and it's just a fun place to be. The space is large, and well kept, and management has done a good job of adding value to the membership. Coach consultations, body scanning, personal training, meal plans, skills courses, and recovery options are all available on site, which keeps members engaged for more than just the class workouts. Having traveled to many different boxes around the world, I can safely say that Tustin sets the bar across the board.< /review>

Very simple: Best Programming! Best Coaching! Their customer service is phenomenal. They have the best accountability around. The coaches truly care about making you a better version of yourself every day. The gym produces great athletes yet, not intimidating at all. Everyone is so welcoming. Best gym in SoCal 100%.< /review>

I have been a member here for a year now and I have loved every moment. The workouts are always challenging and there is a great sense of community amongst the members. It feels as if we are part of the CrossFit Tustin family.
The coaches are extremely knowledgeable about the CrossFit brand of exercising and are always reinforcing proper form/scaling of movements to fit each members level of fitness. I have been doing CrossFit for almost 10 years now, and Tustin has the best group of coaches I’ve ever met.< /review>

<Review>I’ve always been intimidated going to the gym because I’m a smaller built guy!  I finally decided to go with my husband to CrossFit Tustin and observe!  After a few times, I decided to join. Now I’m hooked and have been going regularly for 3 months. The coaches there are amazing, they train and encourage you but also know your limitations to scale down your work out!!  It’s been great!!< /Review>< pictures>

<review>CrossFit Tustin has created a community culture where everyone competes against themselves in order to accomplish their personal best fitness. Goals and instruction are differentiated according to individuals’ strengths and areas of growth. Skills are modified as needed in order to help athletes from beginning to elite levels to progress. Talented and hard-working coaches are able to assess and make in-the-moment adjustments to workouts in order to meet individuals’ needs. Whether it’s general fitness or elite athletic performance that a member is seeking, everyone is welcomed and well-supported in their goals. This is a friendly, warm atmosphere with members who have been a part of this community for many years and it is growing larger with new members and new friends every day.< /review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Review>If you want a good workout, this is the place to go. Doesn’t matter if you are a beginner or an elite, you will be challenged to your fullest potential.
You are also surrounded by motivating coaches who make it a priority to make sure you are doing the movements properly.
Great team and community.

LOVE CrossFit Tustin!! Excellent coaches!! State of the art facility with plenty of barbells, Assault Bikes, C2 Rowers, Ski Ergs, Airform Runners, etc!! Plus, there’s 2 bathrooms/showers which are great if you’re going straight to work!! However, the most important for me is the people!! Friendly, encouraging folks who push you to be better!!< /Review>

I moved to Orange County a little over a year ago, and when I moved, I started looking for a box. I had multiple trail days lined up, and luckily for me, Crossfit Tustin was the first one. I walked in and immediately felt welcomed by the coaches and the people. I finished the workout on my back and knew this was the person spot for me. Since then, I have gotten stronger, faster, and my conditioning as improved like crazy. Although those things are great what I love about this box is I have never walked in the door without being welcomed. Such an amazing community. Such amazing people.

I look forward to it every day. If you are someone who is reading this review and wondering if this Box is for you, it is! It does not matter your fitness level the programming and coaching are fantastic and will help you reach your goals.</Review>

CrossFit Tustin is a wonderful box and has amazing coaches. They have built a welcoming community from fitness to elite athletes of all ages.
The coaches really stress safety and proper form to prevent injury. Each WOD is challenging, but can be modified or scaled for your level. The staff care about the members and want to help you reach your personal goals. If you are looking for a fun place to relieve stress and get fit, this is the gym for you!< /Text>

You're not going to find a better equipped crossfit box in orange county.  That being said, what really sets this box apart from the rest is the people.  The community is awesome.  Be prepared to get texts when you start missing classes or skip a workout with movements you may not particularly enjoy.  That's the kind of accountability and friendships that you get here.</Text>

This has been by far the best work out experience I have ever had. Prior to my time here I always felt frustrated in the gym due to my lack of knowledge and physical build. The trainers at CFT are incredibly knowledgeable and personable. They know how to push you to do your best and get the most out of your workout. Safety is always at the forefront of each session and the group atmosphere is healthy and encouraging.

Great people. Great workouts. I definitely would recommend to any of my friends or family.<//review>

I made a decision to join cross-fit Tustin last year. It was the best thing I've done for my fitness. Gym is always super clean. Jevon, Joel, Andrew and Adam are super knowledgeable and awesome friendly coaches! If you are thinking about cross fit this is the gym to be at. Give it a shot you wont regret it.< /Review>

CrossFit Tustin has been a wonderful find! The facilities are quite large and very clean. Equipment is super well maintained and there is lots of it to go around. All of the coaches are fantastic and keep an eye on you throughout your workout to ensure form isn’t slipping and offering suggested tweaks for improvement. Classes can be big but I love the competitive feel / energy of having so many others (of totally varying fitness levels) around. Been to many CrossFits over the years and this is the best overall experience and community.<//text>

•There is a sense of belongingness at Crossfit Tustin. The coaches are motivating with the intention of improving their athletes. Coaches reach out and re-evaluate skill and development. The programming caters to all levels with classes scheduled conveniently all throughout the day. Well equipped, sanitary and open space. What makes it even better is the community. Amazing energy•< /Text>

Great place to get in shape. The coaches are very knowledgeable, friendly and really take the time to breakdown the technical aspects of the exercises. The workouts are very well rounded with a good balance of cardio, Olympic weight lifting, core and accessory work. Crossfit Tustin also stands out with the implementation of ROM WODs. A yogaesque stretching session -usually done after Thursday workouts- that really helps alleviate lactic acid build up from previous work outs. My favorite aspect of the Crossfit Tustin's business model is the sense of community they create. Joel and his team do a great job at encouraging that sense of community by organising lots of fun in-house events and also by supporting and promoting lots of community events. This is most evident in the member's support of each other during tough work outs. All in all Crossfit Tustin's well balanced workout regiments and friendly members makes it fun to get in shape on your way to becoming an elite athlete. Thank you Joel and team for all you do!<//text>

A fantastic fitness family that offers programming for all ages and skill levels.  Experienced coaches that go the extra mile.  This gym has the latest equipment and lots of classes for all hours of the day.  Open gym Sunday is my fav.   I have learned SO much and achieved so many goals after being a member for the last couple years.  I've been to many CF Gyms (Boxes) and  this by far is the highest rated of all.< /Text>

Being a fitness enthusiast my entire life, I've tried CF a handful of times but it never stuck.  I've always felt like there's been a lack of guidance (which is really important with complex lifts) and some bad programming at other boxes.  CF Tustin is the first place that has gotten me to stick to it.  The coaches are knowledgeable and experienced enough correctly cue complex lifts and the programming here is on point.  Every workout is scaled to each individual's ability.  The workouts are great, but what really makes this place special is the fun community culture that's been created here.  At the end of the day, this place actually gets me excited about working out and that's no easy feat.< /text>

Crossfit Tustin is amazing. Great community. Fun energetic. The staff is great, supportive, patient, fun and flexible. The one thing I truly like about Crossfit Tustin, is when I don’t feel like working out but I show up, my classmates, the environment makes me push harder in a friendly competitive way. I leave class feeling like I have accomplished something for the day and happy.<//review>

I love Tustin Crossfit!! The staff and coaches harbor a great environment and the people/community is AWESOME!! There are day 1 beginners to advance athletes but everyone encourages each other and it brings out the best in people. I've been to a lot of gyms and trained several different disciplines and I can honestly say this is hands down my favorite place to workout, sweat, and fitness! Come and see for yourself! Thank you Crossfit Tustin!!!<//text>

The gym has great equipment, a lot of space internally, great knowledgeable coaches, great running markers, numerous classes (both in time and diversity) and most of all great people. Everybody is friendly, welcoming and genuinely care about each other. There is also a very nice balance between high performance athletes (always doing RX or RX+) and athletes who modify, plus a pretty core group of people who work on additional conditioning on the side. Highly recommend dropping in for a class to experience it for yourself.</Review>< pictures>

Absolutely recommend this Crossfit Gym. The coaches and facility is great! I’ve been coming here for almost a year and a half and have no complaints. The music is always on point the atmosphere is great no matter what the time of day it is. There’s such a family vibe here and it’s all because of the awesome coaches. Adam, Aaron, Jevon, Joel and Megan are so professional and polite and very knowledgeable.< /Text>

First, and most importantly CF - Tustin has Amazing Humans and it becomes family. Second, the facility is awesome and coaching great. Third, it's a place you'll be able to become the best version of yourself and achieve those short and long term health & fitness goals. So whether you are a casual fitness athlete or trying to be/or are a competitive athlete, Tustin has something built for you.< /text>

This was the first time I have ever done CrossFit and the the things I have learned are unreal. The coaches are very hands on teaching all the mechanics to perform each movement correctly ensuring you don't get hurt. Im not going to lie I was very skeptical in the beginning but I love it. Thank you guys!!!</text>

<text>I highly recommend Crossfit Tustin as your everyday gym! The owners and coaches are incredible. They are all very knowledgeable, friendly, and have great personalities. They also know you by name. The equipment is in great condition and very clean. Not only are the owners and coaches genuinely nice people, but so are the members. Before I found CF Tustin, I trialed a few other CF gyms...they were super clickey and  just gave off a not so welcoming vibe. At CF Tustin, it's pretty cool that not only the coaches make you feel welcome, but the members do too. Give them a try!</text>< gmap_id>

I love this place...the Coaches are experienced and caring and the community is welcoming and inspiring.  They say that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.  CrossFit Tustin helps me raise the bar.

A couple other things I like about this box.  The equipment is varied and well maintained and the size of the space is perfect.  Not so big you feel lost and too small so you feel claustrophobic.

Everyone at this gym is on their own journey...some of us are 9 to 5'ers who want a challenging/functional workout and who have a limited amount of time and some of the members are athletes who compete.  It's inspiring to see everyone, everyday crushing.

My husband and I workout at 4:30pm M-F.  We relish our rest days on Sat and Sun but by Monday we can't wait to get back.

If you decide to try it out find me and say hi!< /Review>

<Text>Crossfit Tustin is really great!  They have classes to fit most schedules as well as open gym during the day when there are no classes.  The facility is large and clean.  However, the main draw is the coaching staff and community.  The coaches work hard with the new people to make sure they learn correct form, and will scale exercises to everyone's level, so they can get the most benefit from each workout.  All the CFT members encourage each other, and it's a great environment.< /Text>< Pics>

Could not recommend a CrossFit gym more. After researching and trying out different places I showed up at Crossfit Tustin and felt at home. The Coaching staff are engaging, friendly and knowledgeable giving each workout its own purpose and intensity. They take the time to make sure you are engaging with the workout movements correctly and are diligent to instruct on why and how each movement ought to be done. The facilities are spacious, clean and well supplied, even with the occasional  40 people working out at once you can find a space to get the workout you need. The community that CFT has built is amazing, not only do the individuals in each class know and enjoy being together but welcome in each new person with intentionality and kindness. Whether you are looking for a place to get a daily workout or to hit that next level of fitness I encourage you to come to Crossfit Tustin, you won't regret it.< /Text>

Every time I am in Orange County, this is my go to box. I can't say enough good things about it. The facility is great, couching is awesome and the members are very welcoming.

If you re looking for a place to drop in, this is it. If you are local, stop looking and join!<//review>

If you’re looking for knowledgeable staff, clean facility, tons of equipment and the best community anyone could ask for come visit CrossFit Tustin. CFT was my first exposure to CrossFit. I had never formally visited a gym, and very limited experience, all the coaches and fellow CrossFitters were extremely patient and always willing to provide guidance. A major factor for me choosing CFT is their hours. I needed classes later in the evening and they are the only ones in my area with 6:30 and 7:30 pm offerings. Overall, I cannot express how awesome this community is. Come try a class and experience it for yourself!</Review>

Crossfit Tustin is an amazing Crossfit box. From the coaches (who are informative and love what they do) to the space (which is large and clean) to the equipment (which consists of pretty much everything you could imagine) to the hours (open gym all day long with lots of great class times) to the members (who are ALL welcoming). I've traveled and moved quite a bit for my job and can honestly say CFT is at the top of the list when it comes to CF gyms. Whether you are looking to drop-in or join, you won't be disappointed.< /review>

Hands down THE best Crossfit gym in OC!! I tried 4 different gyms in the area and this one is by far the best. I went to many different crossfit boxes whenever I traveled and crossfit Tustin is by far the best!!

Good mix of Male/ Female coaches, programming is great and challenging, lots of classes at different time of the day, also open gym hours.

Mix of super fit competitive crossfit athletes and “normal” people LOL

Even if everyone is on his own fitness journey (losing or gaining weight, gaining muscles/ strength, working of specific weightlifting skills, competing in crossfit…) everyone mix well together.

Joel, the owner, is also very connected with a lot of health specialist in the area, when I first started to workout there I asked him if he could help me find a good chiropractor in the area and he recommended me one. She helped me a ton with an old neck injury I was struggling with for years. If you need help with an injury or with nutrition, they have coaches or qualified people they can recommend you.

There’s also a massage therapist, who is at the gym for a couple hours every Friday, very helpful if you need some advice or some body work done!

Equipment: they have a lot of EVERYTHING (Assault bikes, rowers, ski erg, peg board, tons of free weights, barbells) and it’s well maintained! They have a big bright space (lots of daylight) and high ceilings, great for rope climbs!

If you workout there regularly, BONUS you will also meet Bentley & Maverick, the gym dogs!!! They are awesome and bring even more life into the place :-)

The only downside is that it’s a bit pricey, but it’s California, everything is more expensive here and you get what you pay for! I’ve been to other gyms who were charging a bit less, but the quality of the coaching/ equipment/ space was nothing compared to this place! Totally worth spending the money if you are ready to make some changes in your life and invest in your health & fitness, you will find a coach for you at that box and you will get results pretty quickly if you put in the work!! If you want results, this is the place to go to! Thank you Joel, Adam, Jevon, Aaron, Megan, Chris…and all the other coaches!!</Text>

Great place to work out. I'd been searching for some decent gym that has equipment I need for my workout routine but hadn't been able to find one until I found this gym. Staffs there are very helpful and friendly. The only downside is their bit overpriced monthly fee for an opengym. Everything else is perfect.</text>

Crossfit Tustin is more than just a « box », it’s a 2nd home !
Fantastic staff and coaches, friendly members always supporting each other and pushing everybody to his own limits to improve.

As an expatriate (from France), definitively Crossfit Tustin is one of the best part of my expatriation !< /text>

Tons of equipment, really solid coaching and no egos in the gym. From games level athletes to old guys like me, we all work out together and encourage each other (though some may use a little more weight than me and finish the workout slightly before me). It's all fun and a great workout with the coaching ensuring that you meet your fitness goals.

Crossfit Tustin has a great community and wonderful coaches. I have been a member for several years and I don't even want to think about the shape I would be in without them. All are friendly, enthusiastic and very supportive. The coaches are well trained and make sure you do movements the right way, keeping your work out safe and effective.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Text>I have gained weight ever since having my lovely second kid and 3 years have passed without working out. My mom’s sides are all diabetics so I had to keep working out to stay away from becoming one as long as I can. I tried many workout routines and crossfit was something that I always wanted to try but was scared. I was scared of falling behind or of not understanding what to do as crossfit seems to have its own language. But my husband told me Crossfit Tustin is very welcoming and kind so I started here a month ago. I am still a bit shy but trainers are all very specific and kind and always answers to all of my questions. I have not been long enough to share on my improvements or how much stronger I got but I love coming here to workout. I’ve learned a lot of new things as well as fixed some of my bad forms. For me it is alot of fun. So challenging and keeps me out of breath but one hour of doing something good for myself sure feels great 👍🏻</Text>< Pics>

Crossfit Tustin has a great community and wonderful coaches. I have been a member for several years and I don't even want to think about the shape I would be in without them. All are friendly, enthusiastic and very supportive. The coaches are well trained and make sure you do movements the right way, keeping your work out safe and effective.<//Review>

Great Box!

I was in town for 2 weeks from Canada, and the coaches here were great. Been working on muscles ups for a while, and finally got my first one here!

Thanks guys!<//Text>

Life changing in so many ways. Extremely welcoming community. No need to be "fit" to start. Commitment to my health and fitness has never been higher. Made countless new friends. Kept me sane during a stretch of unemployment. CFT actually helped me get out of unemployment and into the job I wanted when I moved to CA. There aren't enough thanks to go around.</Review>

I have been a long time runner and joining CFT was my first real exposure to cross fit. At first I struggled with the work out due to several years of just running and never felt judged or out of my element. The coaches were patient, encouraging and have so much experience to help your form along the way. I worked one-on-one with Andrew and the guy is truly an exceptional athlete and person. After just a few months, I have noticed a huge difference in my body, endurance and performance. I will add that the managing partner, Joel, is a very nice person and is running the gym in such a positive manner where it attracts good people, good training, and good experiences.  I am very,very happy being a part of CFT.</Text>

< Review>
Crossfit always sounded crazy intense to me and I was never a competitive "sports sports sports!" type of person so I was very nervous to try it out. However, Crossfit Tustin is so unbelievably welcoming and warm that you feel at home as soon as you step in the door. Everyone is friendly and genuinely excited to meet you and to work out with you. There's no pressure there to be better than anyone else - the only goal is to improve upon your own skills and to try your hardest. It's a true community that not all Crossfit boxes have and I've never felt stronger, more confident in my own abilities, or more connected to so many fantastic and inspiring people.<//Review>

My wife and I have been going to CFT for about 3 years and I couldn't imagine being at a different gym. Whether you are a seasoned crossfitter or testing it out for the first time, CFT is a great spot for both. The new members always seem welcomed and quickly become part of the regulars. The space is large and quality. The coaches are top notch, attentive and committed. Most of all, the community feel here is the best. These people--coaches and members--become your advocates, motivators and friends.<//text>

I was visiting Irvine area and I needed get in my daily wod.  I dropped in at Crossfit Tustin and I almost didn't want to leave.  Everyone was super friendly there and made me feel very comfortable.  The box was huge and it even had an Oly lifting section  I would recommend CF Tustin to anyone that is local or just visiting.  I'll definitely drop in again when I visit the area.< /text>

<Text>If you've never tried crossfit before then you should stop in a few before signing up with any of them. I was at a horrible crossfit and didn't realize it until i tried a few others. The coaches at Tustin are great. They enforce correct technique over heavy weights to prevent injury. When you're injured you can't work out. The people that work out here are in amazing shape and they really support each other.  The gym is huge compared to other crossfit's I've been to and is always clean. I cannot say enough good things about this place, i only wish i found this place sooner.</Text><Resp>None</Resp>< userid>

<resp>None<//resp><Review>When you’re considering a medical or aesthetic procedure it can be intimidating and anxiety-producing. We all want a fair price and a good deal but we also want quality and precision. Korman’s reputation is what caught my attention. Very reputable in the Bay Area and they have awesome package deals and promotions. The entire staff is kind, welcoming and very professional. I was put at ease the moment I walked through their doors on Story Rd. I honestly can’t fathom ever going any place else at this point.

<Review>I did a procedure on my face therefore I did my research on Doctor Korman and his staff before going. The truth is, no amount of research done can tell you how great they are until you go! The staff is incredibly friendly and place is fully COVID proof. Stephanie did an amazing job on my procedure. Nicole was very helpful as well and answered all my questions. I can proudly say I am so much more confident. Every penny was worth it. Thank you to Doctor Korman and all his staff</Review></record>

<Review>Dr. Korman is a perfectionist and a true master of his skill. Nicole, who handled my initial appointments and all my questions and concerns is the sweetest and is just a doll to work with. She got back to me right away, even on her day off. Professional and friendly. After 3 months post op, I can say the results are everything I envisioned and more. My results have been described by my boyfriend as being "Perfect"!< /Review>< Pictures>

I was seen back in April for a breast augmentation. Everything from schedule, to the day of, to after care was top notch! Any time I had any question, all I had to do was reach out to Nicole and she was so quick to help me out. The customer service and bed side manner is wonderful. The team in the surgery center did such a good job of calming my nerves and keeping me relaxed. I am so happy I decided to have my surgery done here. My results are also amazing.

<Review>The last few years, my eyelids were becoming noticeably worse. I was always the person running towards the camera. After a while, I opted to not take pictures or made sure I was wearing sunglasses. At forty-three, I decided to schedule the blepharoplasty. (upper only) The results tremendously surpassed my expectations and my insecurity had disappeared. Dr. Korman took his time to explain the procedure and provide reassurance. He is thorough, patient, and has a wonderful demeanor. During surgery, I was completely relaxed, talking, and singing to the music of Stevie Wonder!

I cannot emphasize enough the professionalism and authenticity of
Dr. Korman and his entire staff. My surgical experience was amazing from beginning to the end. I would highly recommend him to other patients.<//Review><gmap_id>0x808fb6d294b305bf:0xe03b01608dc5ad28<//gmap_id>< Resp>

< Review>
Dr. Korman and his staff are top notch! After researching several different plastic surgeons in the area I am so thrilled that I went with Dr. Korman. I couldn't be happier with the outcome of my surgery.
While other surgeons weren't sure if they could do what I wanted, Dr. Korman was open to my ideas and instilled confidence. He is a highly trained, experienced, and gifted surgeon who I felt absolutely safe with. He is professional and has a nice demeanor. Between him and his staff I was well taken care of. They were all so attentive to me and my needs. Every question or concern I had was promptly answered and followed up with. I plan to go back to them for more services and highly recommend them!< /Review>

Everything was great with Dr Korman. He's great to talk to, super knowledgeable, and very experienced. My results are amazing and I have no regrets. The only reason I removed a star is because I sometimes have to wait an hour or more past my appointment time to be seen.<//review>

I was pleased with the results after the first treatment; there was a noticeable difference.  I ended up going back for a second set of targeted treatments, both because the first set worked but also because the first set didn't achieve full results (which is what I was expecting, based on the discussion I had with Korman beforehand).  I was overall pleased with the results, as well as the professionalism that Korman displayed in setting expectations and implementing the procedure.  I'd recommend them to others.</review>< pictures>

< review>
Dr. Korman is an artist!  He did some work on my wife a few years ago and this year on me.   I was able to lose ~80 pounds over the past few years leaving me with a lot of extra skin.  In fact, back when Dr. Korman worked on my wife, I met with him and he said that I needed to lose more weight before he recommended I have anything done.  It took another 2 or 3 years to lose more weight but I'm glad I listened to his advise!

I was 280 pounds at my heaviest and am now 200 with no extra skin hanging around.  I appreciate Dr. Korman's honesty, realism and true artistry with the human figure.

Dr. Korman,  thank you for helping me look as good as I can with my body!  This was the first summer in 15 years I was able to take my shirt off at the beach without feeling uncomfortable.

The entire Korman staff has been wonderful and easy to work with as well.  Everyone has been really kind and professional throughout my experience.  Keep up the great work and know that I will highly recommend Dr. Korman in the future.

Thanks for helping me change my life!<//review>

During the whole process with Dr. Korman, he was a delight to work with. Dr. Korman has a great team working at his facility that provide great customer service, from the first initial consultation to multiple follow up after the surgery. Nicole  kept in constant communication with me to make sure the pre and post-surgery gave me the best results while making sure I was doing great during the whole process. Overall, I would recommend Dr.Korman and his team to anyone because of there amazing customer service and their helpfulness.< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Korman and Patrick are fabulous. This office is very clean, and the staff are professional, welcoming, and non-judgmental. While this is a busy practice, it is run well and patients are given the time and attention they need, and treated like human beings. I met with Patrick for my initial consultation. He was very patient, reassuring, honest, knowledgeable,  supportive, and non-judgmental in addressing my many questions and concerns, and exploring my goals.

<Review>I was skeptical of the effects from cool sculpting but I'm so happy to say it was a positive experience! I worked with Patrick from the Mountain View office and from our first consultation he provided me with straight talk which was much appreciated. I never worried that I was just a dollar sign but rather a customer in which this office was interested in helping to achieve the results I desired.< /Review>< name>

Dr Korman was referred to me by several of my friends who'd had surgery by him recently. Since they looked so good I decided to get a lower face/neck lift with Dr Korman. I am so happy that I did! The work he performed and the results are great and I am thrilled. His office staff is also great. Clean office, great dr, great results, friendly staff...who could ask for more???<//text>

I could not have asked for a better experience, from the moment they answered my call before I even scheduled a consultation to all of my follow-up visits! I would recommend this practice a thousand times over!</Text>

< Review>
This review is written 3 months after I got coolsculpting done in 6 different areas. This was my first time doing it so I was quite hesitant but Patrick was very informative during the consultation and addressed all my concerns around the procedure in a transparent way. My biggest concern was the possibility of coolsculpting backfiring and causing paradoxical adipose hyperplasia. Patrick reassured me and told me that the chances of this happening were very small.
The procedure itself went smoothly. I had redness and swelling immediately after, which quickly resolved in a few days.
Around a month post procedure, I started feeling the results as my clothes fit more loosely. The problem areas I had the procedure on were definitely smaller. I am a petite person so it'd be very difficult for me to achieve the same results through exercise and dieting alone. I feel like coolsculpting was definitely worth it!<//Review>

I started going to Elisa for hydrafacials 3 months before my wedding and she changed my skin! My skin has never been clearer or glown like it does now. She is amazing and helped me find a skin routine that has forever changed my life. So thankful!!<//Text>

Dr Korman is the only surgeon I will allow to touch me..... my husband thinks he is amazing... I am 47 years old and because of Dr Korman's amazing talent,  people say that I look like I'm in my early thirties. Dr Korman has an artists eye, a doctors attention to detail and the bedside manner of a friend.<//text>

<text>Patrick from Dr. Korman's office was great!! He was easy to talk to.  My whole Coolscupting procedure was quick and well worth it.  They were super nice and accommodating to be able to squeeze me in last minute for an abdominal treatment. Not to mentioned the results were unbelievable!</text>< Rating>

Went for Coolsculpting with Patrick from Dr. Korman's office and he was great!! He was easy to talk to and helpful about explaining everything that was happening. The procedure took about 2 hours. I'm happy I went there and looking forward to my final results.< /Text>

<Text>I was unhappy with my excess belly fat and semi- hanging flap above my c-section scar. I had 2 children but my last birth (3 years earlier) just really cause my abdominal area to look worst than ever due to the c-section.

Nicole B. was so patient our first time speaking over the phone. I had a lot of questions and concerns because I was new to body surgery. Nicole was really kind. The consultations are FREE. I met Nicole in person and she was just as kind as she was previously on the telephone.

I really did not want to get a tummy tuck since it is more invasive also healing time required.

First time meeting Dr. Korman he friendly and easy to talk to. I had a lot of anxiety (exposing my most self-conscious area my tummy). Dr. Korman said I would be a good candidate for SmartLipo/Vaser. I would get the procedure done one abdominal, back, underarms, and thighs. Yay! Dream come true!

The front office helped me process my loan with Credit Care. I was able to schedule the procedure and get in only a week later =),

Day of Surgery:
The surgery site is next door (same building, different suit #), the staffs were very nice getting me situated for the procedure. When I woke from the procedure there was a nurse by my bed side helping me and wheeled me out to my DD's car.

Post surgery:
Healing was pretty smooth although there were lots of swelling the 3-5 days. I had a post op appointment the next day, and Dr. Korman told me I had about 7 pounds fo fat remove @-@.

I'm on post surgery day 6. I can already see a difference already no more muffin top, and I have a waistline again! I can't wait to see how it'd bee i the next 3-6 weeks!

Everyone at the office is so kind and extremely nice. I have so many questions and they were always so patient. Thank you Farheen, Stephanie, Nicole and last but not least Dr. Korman. Thank you all, for making my first experience with w/body surgery go so smoothly!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Today was my first treatment for my double chin via coolsculpting. It was my first time too, I’ve never done anything in my face neither in my body. So i was a bit scared. But Patrick was so professional and was actually so good that all my worries went away and I felt comfortable in my chair and was very excited :-). I did not feel any pain at all or any discomfort while the coolsculpting machine was in my chin. After 45 minutes Patrick massages the area, i felt a little tenderness, that’s it, not painful at all. While the second massage on the second area i felt nothing, no tenderness. It’s because Patrick was gentle and again really good. I highly recommend Korman Plastic Surgery, it’s worth your time and money. I can’t wait for my second treatment. Thank you very much Patrick, see you in five weeks :-).</review>

Dr. Korman is very professional and his staff are extremely kind and helpful.  I feel like I can return for procedures without feeling much stress or concern. I went into Korman Plastic Surgery for scar revision and also decided to try some cool sculpting. I had open heart surgery last year and I noticed it wasn't healing as well as I had hoped.  There were a few raised areas, one in the middle was particularly bumpy.  I was worried that they were keloid scars and I had heard those are difficult to correct.  When I met Dr. Korman, he took a look at the scar and informed me that what I had was actually hypertrophic scarring which is much easier to treat.  He reassured me that he could repair these areas without cutting the entire scar again.  On the day of the surgery, he was very patient and kind with me. The team made sure I was comfortable and ready for the resection.  During the procedure, Dr. Korman made sure that I had enough numbing agent so that I could not feel the cuts. He worked quickly and efficiently, I was home in no time at all.  After the scabbing was gone I realized just how flat he made the scar look.  He offered my steroid injections as a part of the surgical fee and explained that I had the option of using silicone bandages as well. Now, I am using Embrace silicone bandages that his nurse showed me how to apply.  I will add more pictures, but I can't believe how much better it looks already.
Next, the cool sculpting!  WOW!  I had heard about it on TV so when I learned that they offered it at Dr. Korman's office I decided to give it a try.  I have always had a hard time losing the fat on my lower abdomen above my pelvis. I am generally thin, so my little pot belly seemed to be quite noticeable. After enduring a few embarrassing comments from others, I became pretty self conscious about it.  I was always told that it was probably my posture but when I came in Dr. Korman, he told me that I could potentially lose an inch or so off the area but that I should make sure to strengthen my core and work on my posture as well.  He and Patrick were so motivating to me that after the cool sculpting procedure, I really stepped up my exercise regimen.  After the first month, I noticed the difference in my belly and it motivated me even more to continue to push myself.  Now, after two months I can't believe how much different my stomach looks! I can see the definition in my abdominal muscles and I no longer feel like I have a pot belly.  The cool sculpting clearly works and I feel so much more confident... just in time for beach season!<//Review>

<gmapID>0x808fb6d294b305bf:0xe03b01608dc5ad28</gmapID><Review>I had my first coolsculpting treatment 6 weeks ago by Patrick and Serena from Dr. Korman’s office.   I had my belly, oblique, and back areas treated, which required 2 cycles altogether (35 minutes per cycle).  The process was not at all cold nor uncomfortable as I expected....just a little messy from the gel on the applicators.  At 6 weeks post treatment, I feel a slight reduction in my belly area.  But they said to expect results in about 3 months, so I’m sure I’ll see more results later. Patrick and Serena were very professional and thorough, and Dr. Korman was very pleasant to talk to. If you’re considering coolsculpting but still on the fence  about it, I totally recommend you go for it. I wish I had done this a couple of years ago.<//Review>< pics>

Why go to Dr. Korman you ask?  My experience from start to finish, one word... AMAZINGNESS!  In February of this year Dr. Korman performed a Brachioplasty (Reduces excess sagging skin that droops downward also known as an arm lift).  I am delighted with my results as I am going on month five.  Price was competitive, staff was well-trained and knowledgeable, doctor was accessible, surgery staff was kind and caring and follow-up is what really just seals the AMAZING!  It's like someone holding your hand while you ride the bike until your training wheels are ready to come off.  I really cannot say enough positive things, it was a 5-star experience and continues to be -- Gina<//Text>

<Resp>None</Resp><time>1526532063510<//time><review>I contacted Dr. Korman's office to get a CoolSculpting consultation after seeing their Diamond Crystal rating on the CoolSculpting website. I wanted a practice that was professional and had a lot of experience with the treatment and I was not disappointed. Dr. Korman's staff are very friendly and professional, particularly Patrick who explained the procedure to me and patiently answered all of my questions. I felt very confident that I would be in good hands for my treatment.

I had CoolSculpting done on my abdomen and inner thighs and it was such a pleasant experience. Patrick carefully drew guidelines on me to make sure that the applicators would be placed in the optimal locations and then explained every step before proceeding. I was able to work on my computer for much of the time using their guest WiFi. The rest of the time I put in my earbuds and listened to music. The only uncomfortable part was the 2 minute massage of the treated area after the applicator is removed. Well worth it, in my opinion!  I can't wait to see the results!<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< user>

I moved up here from Los Angeles in 2013 and needed to keep up with my appearance with price in mind. I began searching for the competitively priced offices for my Dysport/Botox treatments. I'll get back to that in a minute.

In 2016, I FINALLY decided to get my breast aug. So, I began interviewing doctors all over the Bay Area. The consultations began to get very repetitive, BUT every doctor seemed to have a different opinion with scar placement/incision site.  Honestly, there wasn't an office that I really felt 100% confident with.

When I met Serena at Dr. Joshua Korman's office, I felt like I knew her since childhood. There was no question that went unanswered, no fear that was put at ease, and no financial hiccup that wasn't fully solved. Then I met Dr. Korman. At first he seemed quiet and somewhat tough to read; however, I now realize why. He's a freakin GENIUS; he's observing, calculating and already putting together his strategy for how he would work with your body type, build and potential hurdles. Needless to say, I trusted him instantly.

The kicker, is that he was ALSO interviewing ME! He made it clear that he wants these types of procedures are “Happiness Surgeries,” not problem solvers. Let me tell you, NOT ALL SURGEONS CARE LIKE THAT. He took the time to explain ALL the pros/cons of each incision site. Unlike the other surgeons I met with, Dr. Korman doesn't have a preference (or one incision site that he's most comfortable with). I got to decide for myself because he can perform with precision from any of the options. I left that day feeling informed, confident and excited!

When I went home, I began doing some research and found that he is not only an amazing mind and doctor; but, he's genuinely a great person who gives back to the community and is STILL an educator in his field at the HIGHEST Institutions in CA after already having his own practice for over 25 years. Meaning, he's constantly learning and needing to keep up with all the new technology.

After my research and consultation experience, it was a no-brainer; so I scheduled my surgery. I just hit my Two year anniversary (February 2018), and I still say, “Best damn decision I have ever made.” I ABSOLUTELY LOVE my girls. I have never had one issue, no sagging, pockets are tight and right, they fit my frame perfectly, project off my chest amazingly and I couldn't be happier. Dr. Korman is a genius.

Back to the Dysport/Botox - have you ever experienced over-diluted product and bruising? Yea, low cost USUALLY doesn't mean top quality.
I now visit Patrick Ly a couple times a year at Dr. Korman's office. I can't say enough about Patrick; by far the best human ever!

Please take my word for it, as over the last 2 years, I have developed an amazing relationship with the office and have NEVER been dissatisfied, or felt any in-professionalism with any of my visits. I have had Dysport, Fillers, and am planning to do laser hair removal soon! So excited!
Patrick also did Cool Sculpting on me last year on my “flanks” (love handles) and on my lower abs. SUPER happy with the outcome and am blown away with how it actually works (it does take a couple weeks to fully rid the dead fat cells). I loved it SO much, that I actually had a second round done for my 'back fat,' as I call it (flanks again, just farther back). When I went for my second round, they had the newest adapters and equipment for the cool sculpting technology! CLEARLY, they keep up with how quickly the medical field is advancing.

I am so happy with that whole office and with EVERY time I visit.. If you want the best, want the professionals, want the expertise, want the newest technology, and want the best RESULTS... go see Patrick, Serena, and Dr. Korman at one of his THREE offices. You won't regret it, I promise!</Text>

When I initially visited Dr. Korman'S office to inquire about a face lift, I first met with Katrina, Dr. Korman's assistant.  Katrina was friendly, reassuring, and well educated in the field of plastic so that she could answer all my questions.  She clearly explained the pre and post-op procedures. I then met with Dr. Korman who was also warm and easy to talk to.  Dr. Korman and I decided what type of work he would perform on my face for my facelift.  Then Katrina clearly explained the fees for all aspects of the surgery.  A few weeks later, Dr. Korman performed the surgery and I am thrilled with the results.  I look refreshed!< /review>

I was referred by a friend who had a more complex procedure, and this friend exclaimed how happy he was with the work.

To start, Dr Korman gives a consultation for his procedures. I thought I would need something more invasive, the same as my friend, but he treated me like family and suggested cool sculpting as a better place to start. He said I didn't have much dermal fat left over and it would be a better value and easier recovery. I learned then that he will offer solutions I actually need, and not offer solutions that are excessive or have risks I don't need to take.

I had been exercising a lot and eating healthy, and my body showed it, but I couldn't get rid of the stubborn belly fat that remained no matter what I did. I didn't want to go the unnatural route to burn it off and harm my body so I decided to give Dr Korman's advice a try. I'm very glad I didn't have to undergo surgery and I am quite impressed with the results. They were most optimal because the procedure did its part to destroy my fat cells, and I did my part to continue to eat cleanly and exercise.

Next I came to Dr Korman for a botox treatment. I used to go to one of those chain places for my preventative treatments for wrinkles and headaches. It started out well and I was really impressed, but my usual left when she got promoted and I haven't found a person since who can treat me and have it work in first trip without a touchup. Dr Korman uses the best quality and freshest of botox. I had the best treatment, first try, that I've had since I started. I made sure I went to the gym earlier that day as planned, and not after my treatment to ensure the botox was able to take its full effect.

Finally, I decided to go for something more difficult. I always cut myself shaving because I have a mole just above my upper lip. I wanted to also have moles removed from my back. Dr Korman, again, gave good advise and further strengthened my trust. I didn't want scars by removing a mole by the root, but slicing was a good alternative if a mole wouldn't grow back.

I opted to only go for my face mole to play it safe. I also wanted to go with someone who is good at what he does because it's my face. The mole removal would be a functional improvement but I didn't want to go to a knock off place and have someone disfigure me also. Dr Korman let me know what was going to happen each step and walked me through the procedure to keep me relaxed. The end result is that the mole is gone, and there are absolutely no scars! The slice was flawless and the Neosporin I used assisted in the healing.

To sum everything up. Dr Korman is a very skilled and caring individual. He does top-level work and goes for perfection, and has a wonderful sense of humor in all my interactions with him. He is someone I can trust. I was able to achieve optimal results each time I worked with him because I also did my part and took responsibility for my body in each recovery. He will always keep up his end of a procedure. Be sure to keep up your end as well and take good care of yourself.< /text>< user_name>

I was staying across the street and my travel partner and I decided to escape the weird club that turns down for nothing that our hotel lobby turned into every night and check out the Frolic. Any bar that puts itself forward with such a lovely neon sign in the midst of more modern facades was worth at least a quick visit, we decided.< /Text>

We come to Dave's on Broadway when we are visiting Glendale. We always feel welcomed here. It's nice when we make it during happy hour. I enjoy eating peanuts while drinking a nice cold draft beer. Sara and Laura Jean are very friendly. They have free hotdogs not sure if it's just during happy hour. I would have to say they were pretty darn good. When you are in town stop in the oldest bar in Glandale I'm sure you will meet a new friend. They also have a pool table.Till next time...cheers!< /review>

Classic dive bar and the oldest bar in Glendale if not LA! Karaoke is a theme at least 3 nights a week which makes for a great excuse belt a song you love or listen to surprisingly talented LA singers do their part; all parties feel welcome to do so here. I love Sunday's where they have a fun DJ and free pool aswell as a bartender that sets the bar (pun intended) for excellent service and vibe!!< /review>

I met many local amazing musicians.  In the past, Dave's offered live entertainment, open mic nights and karaoke. I sang with bands and was blessed to sing on a couple different albums.

I have mixed feelings now about coming here. It's extremely convenient for me but several visits to karaoke has left me with a feeling of disappointment and emptiness. I know that late in the night, the bar gets new young blood and they want to cater to them, but when I arrive at 11:00 with only a few names on the list, buy a couple, three drinks and get to sing one song around 1:00 a.m., I feel I have wasted money and time.

Tonight, I heard a couple other people complaining similar stories. Maybe Dave's doesn't need the neighborhood standbys anymore. I certainly don't see the regular faces I use to see.

That being said, the bartender is awesome and newcomers seem to enjoy themselves. "The times, they are a changing."</text><response>None</response>< name>

Popular. Dive bar. Difficult to get on the single pool table. The bucket of beer is reasonably priced. Loud.< /Review>

Went on a Saturday evening about 6pm. Was seated immediately.  Sushi was well made, and tasted good. Serve was excellent. Price is as expected moderate. I would indeed come back.</review>

< Review>
Cool spot they got different activities throughout the week we stopped by on Wednesday they had karaoke going on. 90% was locals just hanging out. Drinks are reasonably priced and you get to choose from nuts or  Pretzel bites ( I think) I got the salted nuts.

Seems to seat a total of 15-25 and fit about 50 people they do have a back walkway/ally to hang and smoke. Would I come back? Yes.</Review>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Best "dive bar" that isn't a dive bar in Glendale.  Cheap drinks (like the only place in town where I can get a $5 Fat Tire), pool table that is $1 (free on Sundays), free hot dogs by the pool table and it's actually a clean place.  Open until 2am weekends I believe.</Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I gave this venue a 5 star for a Monday night as it reminded me of being in Ireland where everyone gets along with cool live music. There was an amazing americana rock jazz almost country originals band. I just found their facebook page The Still Moving Project.  The atmosphere was great fun with a sense of community and a young crowd. The time I went one or two musicians who came along were invited up to play with the band on their last set and it was super cool fun!<//Review>

The daytime Bartender Sarah was very pleasant, although the bartender who has been there the longest has turned into a nasty gossip and talked about her boss and other customers in a knifing way.  When a girls drink was tampered with and her credit card was lifted, the bartender became a two faced coward and told the girl she would have to leave and threatened to call the police on her, instead of helping the girl find her card and merely replacing her drink. .. shameful behaviour. New threatening ownership perhaps?  Clientele intimidation? Disappointing.<//Text>

I to have passed this bar many times living in glendale and i have not once tried to go in until recently. My impression of the place was amazing as i saw that what i thought to be just old men sitting watching tv and drinking was a more younger type crowd. Me and a friend went and sat at the bar and people watched as they sang kereoke. The bartender was even singing here. I saw a few cute girls here as well which made it even better.<//Text>

You can help people without being rude or giving nasty comments or putting people down. They need people skills. Some professionalism and common courtesy from staff would be nice. I guess Sierra view doesn’t hold their staff to any certain standards when dealing with the public. God bless them because they need it. And God bless all the people that got to deal with ugly staff.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

<rating>1</rating><Review>I came here because of severe abdominal pain, waited more than 6 hours for the results. I could’ve gone to a professional hospital in LA and this hospital still wouldn’t have given me my results. I also talked with a guy who came to the same ER in fear of being in the midst of a whole HEART ATTACK and he’s been waiting even longer than I have. Highly suggest going anywhere but here. You could probably die and still be waiting on your results.< /Review>< pictures>

If you want to wait 2-3 hours in the ER waiting room and for them just to send you home (and going to another hospital and they keep you) this would be a good place to go too. Horrible Place better off going to another hospital. Just in it for the $.< /Review>

I was recently hospitalized at Sierra View for five days. The care that I received was excellent. The doctors and nurses were attentive and kind, and ensured that I was well enough prior to be discharged. Thank you to SVMC’s teams! Keep up the good work! You are truly heroes!<//text>

< Review>
My son was seen there on 8/23/2020.. For a deep wound on his elbow . all staff was great and caring from the time we arrived . His nurse in the ER was sweet and caring. And comforting to my son when he was scared to get the stiches done.. She even offered her phone to watch something on youtube to distract him.... I just want to say thank you for all the doctors and nurses and other staff for all their hard work..< /Review>

Honestly Idk why this hospital has so many bad reviews...I guess it depends on the day u go if they are in a bad mood or good mood...The times that I had gone to the ER for myself and my daughter we have been treated very good...Also in the delivery section floor the nurses are always nice to me...I had great experience with both my baby deliveries...And now yesterday 11/23/20 I had surgery and I was treated great by all the staff...Or maybe they look rude or sound rude if u the patient talk back to them...But I had had great visit experiences...< /review>

The first greet from dr was, “you’ve come here 55 times”. I’ve lived here for 8 years and have been to emergency room only 3 other times. I had to request blood lab work because he intended not to request it. I get more blood drawn for my routine anemia than they did here. He said ZERO of lab results and what they tested for....absolutely ZERO. He discharged without addressing pain and said “ I don’t know why you have pain...this is an emergency room”.  I gambled going to ER during pandemic with a medically prone child at home to not have my pain addressed.  The medication he prescribed is useless...it needs to be liquid. Here lying in pain.< /Text>

I was at the emergency room for three hours for kidney stones. They did blood work and still had like eleven patients ahead of me. Had to drive to Delano hospital for treatment with "that pain" which took another hour. I never received treatment or results from my blood work yet I still had to pay. A rep calls me to make payment arrangements and never sends the bill. I just received a collection statement requesting full payment. I have no words for this experience. One star is too much.< /Text>

<review>I would give this establishment a no-star review if I could. The amount of women I personally know that have either actually DIED or suffered life-threatening symptoms after delivering their children here is outrageous and tragic. The labor/delivery nurses are completely at fault due to their delinquency. It is common for nurses at this hospital to leave gauze and other surgical objects inside of their patients after a surgery (e.g. all the women I knew that delivered here had gauze left inside of them and suffered infections and one actually lost her life). And to top all of this inadequacy off, the doctors/hospital affiliates (when informed of these issues) ride them off by stating that "nurses get confused/busy and can mess up, it is not a big deal". I suggest anyone interested in delivering their child here take heed of this warning and find yourself a decent hospital. I have no idea why the nurses at this establishment are so unorganized and lazy (like come on did they not learn the most basic rule that one should always take count of your surgical equipment prior to and after a surgical procedure in order to avoid leaving something inside the patient). I just wish that the hospital would uphold better standards/protocol when hiring/training their nurse staff. I get that it is very common to call out the "nurse" for being "half-witted" but I am sincerely concerned at the lack of care these individuals carry for their line of work. Seems like all they care about is a paycheck and the hospital simply cares about not getting sued. I would never try to demean the hard work that comes along with these medical jobs, but I truly do not think that they care about what they do and that is pathetic. Just because the patient does not fully understand their rights, does not mean one should take advantage of that. Shame on any of the employees that have taken part of or have been passive to these issues.< /review>< time>

Went in to ER with symptoms of a stroke. Waited over 5 hours to get a room. The only reason I’m giving 1 star is for the first Doctor I seen. I don’t know his name, but he immediately ordered tests, showed a tremendous amount of concern did an excellent neuro exam and admitted me for further evaluation.  After he went off duty the physician (if you want to call him that) came in, asked what happened and as soon as I started talking he turned and walked out saying he was going to find me a bed. I had to spend the entire night on a gurney in the ER and the entire next day. It took over an hour each time I pushed my call light for help until a night shift nurse named Michael (a traveler) came in and was right there for me whenever I needed anything. They moved me to telemetry that  evening after change of shift.
I got so many different answers from staff that after 3 days we left completely confused. Too much detail to go into. Just wanted to basically say. I will NEVER go back there again.</Text>

< Review>
Came in to the ER after a self-inflicted suicide attempt the day before, to ask for a mental evaluation, waited around an hour and a half to speak to an assigned nurse (not the staff that did basic heart rate tests and allergy questions) and another hour and a half hour later to see an actual doctor-- I interrupted Dr. Safarian when I was upset and wanted to leave by that point because I didn't feel the clinic was appropriate, and then he threatened to withhold me "involuntarily for days" if I interrupted him again. Which I did, when I reacted in disbelief and asked "are you threatening me?" and I was kept there for several hours until they got fed up with me asking if what they were doing is legal or not. The doctor's first inclination was to order me not to interrupt him again because I was upset, and then move to forcibly keep me in the hospital "for days" without outside contact.

The nurse that was assigned to me kept saying he'd get my clothes, but after the fourth time asking I peaked out the doorway and saw him having a casual chat with a receptionist. On top of negligence he was just flat out lying to my face, 20 ft away.

At one point they took away the phone I asked for and refused to return it, denying my family who were waiting in the ER and only 'allowed' me to leave after coming VOLUNTARILY, if I saw the same doctor who threatened me to 'clear' me to leave. Awful place. Awful people. The only positive to that day was the crisis worker they had to bring in, which gave me a list of mental health clinics to go to for a mental health evaluation and a contact number to lodge a complain. I went the same day to the clinic.

I hate the fact that my grandfather is currently sick in this same hospital and has to stay there.< /Review>

MD derived sick satisfaction using inappropriate humor at me and family expense.  Turned our concern into a joke and made no attempt to apologize for childish behavior.
Yes I know all about facade of pretending to care about legitimate complaints.  So, this google review will be just as effective as the Patient Experience Officer.  The fact is - even crummy doctors don't grow on trees.  So, there will never be anything meaningful done about the terrible attitudes your staff bring in the door.<//Review>

<review>They maybe deserve half a star.... that should be an option.  The nurses are unwelcoming,  stand offish, and seemingly disinterested in patient care.  They act as if requesting help or information is a major imposition on their time.  Personal conversations prioritized over patients. There seems to be only ONE dr. to oversee patients.  WOW. I keep reading horrible review after horrible review spanning back months.  How embarrassing. Please don't direct me to call a patient care line because it clearly is as ineffective as the staff.</review>< pics>

I was given a hit list to get rid of some of my employees from the Administrator and my Director at the time who where from Lindsay. I refused to do this so i was brought in and demoted and was offered less than half of my current pay. I would be making less than the new employees hired after my 26 years of service. I am very glad to see they are no longer there. I worked with the Doctors and Nurses for 26 years, they where all great, i could not ask for better. I was heart broke to leave my staff and friends with no notice. I thank God they have better leadership now. My advice to them is take care of your loyal staff, they are hard to come by. I have relocated to Oregon since leaving, and I am working in the Mental Heath field, this is my true calling.

<Review>I had surgery at this hospital this past week. I will say I was very skeptical and worried because of all the reviews I’ve read.

But I’ll tell you this, the PreOp RN Manuela was wonderful - she got my IV in with one stick (which is a big deal) & was very friendly, the CNA was very nice as well and oriented me to the room and what I needed to do.

The circulating nurse Julie was very comforting and explained to me exactly what was about to happen. I was able to carry personal conversation which not all nurses do.

The anesthesiologist Dr. Dillol (not sure if I’m spelling it right) was wonderful, I expressed my worries to him and how I was trusting him basically with my life and he made sure to comfort me and inform me very well to the point where I trusted him. He was very patient with me and my concerns, I also received a call from him the day after to see how I was doing.

Dr. Reader, my ENT specialist & surgeon did a great job from my first office visit to now that I am 1 week postop without any complications.

I’m not sure how every unit in this hospital is, but my experience here was great. Thank you.</Review></record>

Was diagnosed with Valley Fever 2 months ago, rarely go to the Hospital, have received X-rays, CT, ultra sound, MRI, along with lab work, and today on my Birthday went in for  guided needle biopsy of my liver, in which made me very nervous but the care and wonderful staff and Drs at SVDH eased my fears and the whole operation turned out smoothly, I truly reassured by they Professionalism and care, other people receiving care seemed very comforted and well taken care of, Thank you all at Sierra View District Hospital</Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>came in for emergency treatment for my husbands life threatening condition after being shown to a hallway bed seen by a p.a. My husbands while suffering with chills and fatigue. Was set upon by nurse phillip who upon seeing me and my husband homeless situation demanded him to get up immediately to move to another room . seeing that he needed assistance didnt offer any nurse phillip threatened to call security even after my husband informed him that he was weak and needed a minute then told us he had one minute to move before he called security. My husband nearly fainted in his rush to switch rooms. Thank god he didnt. Just because we are homeless we were treated like animals instead of humans. We were embarrassed and frightened. By far the worse emergency room and hospital ever.< /Review>< Pictures>

I went to get stat mammo and breast ultrasound. There is a lump and I have a long family history of breast cancer. It's been days and the rad still hasn't read the study. This hospital is the worst when it comes to patient care. They should seriously be investigated.<//text>

I would never recommend going to the ER here! Apparently they have only one doctor so we have waited over 3 hours and still have not seen a doctor! With the amount of people that go to the ER in this town you would think that they could afford to have more than one doctor!! I should have driven to Visalia Hospital!!!< /Review>

<Text>I would give no star if I was allowed to but I have to give one in order to write a review. I have never been to this hospital but it is a nightmare. The registered nurse is rude along with the old lady who accompanies her. It is as if there is nobody else in that backroom that can help besides that one RN in the front. I left as soon as I saw how rude they were being and how long the wait would be. There were people who had been in car accidents sitting and waiting for two hours. This place NEEDS to be shut down.<//Text><user_name>Andrew Flores<//user_name>< UserId.>

Worst hospital trip ever.
Not a single member of the staff even acted like they cared about what was going on. I had to ask for a blanket 5 times before finally getting one. The doctor ignored everything he was told, then disappeared for the remainder of my visit. The nurse went on her lunch without saying a word. I've never experienced such incompetent apathy from a team of medical professionals.

Bottom line: Take the time to go to another hospital. It just might save your life.<//text>

< Review>
This hospital is the worst ! My dad final days of life the nurses and cnas on the third floor left my poor father laying in his poop and pee for longer than an hour. Took me several times just to have someone come change him well the cnas and nurses were laughing and talking all loud about things outside work. On top of that when I approach them they talked very rudely towards me saying I never called them when I did through the nurse call button  which took them another 30 minutes more just so my dad could get changed. And on top of that I told my dad’s RN he needed to be changed. No one came until I started saying this would NEVER HAPPEN IN VISALIA. This is the worst hospital to go too. I wish I could give no stars at all. I wish my poor dad final days in that disgusting hospital weren’t spent like this. Left him sitting on his butt for three days straight they never  bothered to turn him. And gave him a bad open butt sore. Worst experience me and my family went through well my dad was waiting to be sent home for hospice care. !</Review>

My personal experience with this hospital has been a "mixed bag"; both good and poor.
The main complaint is the ER, which has overall good, caring nurses but DREADFUL doctors!
There is a woeful lack of ER beds available, resulting in far too many seriously ill patients having to recline on chairs pushed together, rather than getting a bed...or even a gurney.

However, the main hospital is well run and efficient and-unlike the ER-has caring, conscientious doctors.
I received overall good quality care each time I was admitted for surgical procedures and overnight-or longer-stays.</Text>

Horrible Emergency Room, took my mom last night at 6pm. She had been throwing up for 2 weeks straight and lost 7lbs she looked so pale and could barely stand I didn't want to wait till next week for her appointment with her oncologist so I decided to take her. We were in the waiting room for 2+hrs  Then were finally called to a room at 9pm. They just hooked her up to the monitor and no one came back in at all till 1230am. I finally got frustrated and went to tell the nurse that she just wanted to go home  The nurse said "okay then" and just walked away.  20min later the doctor came in asking what was going on, he was sooo rude  it was unbelievable he wouldn't even let her finish her answers. Instead of her feeling relieved that a dr was finally there she felt worse. We told the nurse we want to leave now we're not waiting for the dr to come back if he ever does decide too. I get that its busy but why not have more doctors there. There was only 1 rude doctor working. It's my fault for giving them a 2nd chance, it would have been a lot better to make the drive out to Visalia.  She goes to Roger S. Good cancer center there at Sierra View and they are amazing I have no idea why the ER is completely different.. would give this negative stars if possible.< /Text>

Feel like dying? Look no further! Come on in, take a seat and kick back you could probably go unnoticed till you meet your demise! Feeling thirsty? Drink from the faucets, it's more chemically altered than microwave sludge! What's that you say? You only have a short amount of time to die before the crazy house catches you? No problem, just grab a dirty needle lying around under the beds and off you go!! From dust to dust you can litteraly choke on it, just grab a handful from behind the plant pots!< /text>

Treated there many times over the years and been happy.  Kinda bothers me though why people go to KDH in Visalia instead.  Layoffs few years ago and I think it made a big difference in employee morale as a whole.  Treat staff great and they will treat patients better and in turn have more patients and therefore,  better profit margin and client loyalty!<//text>

Horribly slow process in the ER compared to other prominent hospitals that actually stands by their commitment of excellence when it comes to urgency and patient care I say this because I’ve sadly known a patient that passed from waiting too long in this ER.as director Shay Moore should really re-evaluate and step up her protocol.<//text>

Chris Seitz P.A. from Sierra View Medical Center was very professional and the excellent staff their was able to quickly supply my own Physician Dr. Mating with all the needed information that Dr. Mating needed to continue my treatment.  Chris Seitz P.A provided thorough information to not only my physician but also to me as the patient.

I have seen the E.R. Techs and nurses provide some of the most optimal care.  They care about their patients.

Keep up the great work.<//review>

<review>I think that some of us tend to only comment or write a review when we are angry, and yes the place gets packed but only because other people do have health problems too. The staff has always been so nice and really made me feel like they cared! In and out in 30minutes!< /review>< gmapID>

<time>1559943209186< /time><Text>This is by far the worst hospital. Especially labor/ delivery I was scheduled to be induced and it’s been a few days that they just keep giving me the run arounds. And to top it off I’m in so much pain but since I’m not dilated enough they can’t keep me. I’m past my due date so I just change hospitals and I’m going to deliver in Visalia this hospital doesn’t care about anyone especially the nurses in labor/delivery!< /Text>< username>

This hospital should be shut down or get better employees!!! I got there at 1:00am & end up leaving at 4:50am without being seen. I find it very unprofessional that the employees that were there all they did was be on their phones & talk about the patients. Then to top it off they too busy not paying attention they overdose a patient & were talking about it like it wasn't nothing. I recommend everyone to just go to Visalia hospital instead of Porterville!!! Be safe & go to a place that know what they are doing instead of going to Porterville & u just might end up dead!!!!</text>

The doctor didn't run any tests on my son when he came in there with his right side hurting. then gave him pain pills and told him he was free to go. He is still there. I called and told them he cant walk and can hardly talk cause the pain is so bad. he don't need pain pills he needs to know what is wrong , what is causing the pain. Some doctor they have huh. I told him to tell the dr to run tests so that he knows what is wrong.< /review>

< review>
If there were a way to give it negative stars, I would. If I were in need of dire medical attention and had the choice between being taken here or just left to die, I would choose being left to die. I feel I would have a greater likelihood of survival being left to die than being taken there for treatment. I wouldn't put it past this facility to have someone brought in for a broken leg and they end up removing both kidneys and sending the patient home with no kidneys and an untreated broken leg. This may sound ridiculous and far fetched, but ask yourself, "is it worth the risk to go here or is there anyway I can get to another hospital?"</review>

My father had a very bad experience while in the hospital.  Our family decided that it was necessary for a family member to be with him at all times so that they wouldn' t mistreat him.  Very sad!  No one should be mistreated--especially when they are sick.< /Review>

<Text>NO THANKS

Never had been here till last week  but I came here after a whole 24 hours of not being able to hold down anything, severe abdominal pain, high fever, etc. finally after an hour of waiting and throwing up still in the waiting area, the Dr came by for 2 mins and said you will have to go to the other side because you need an IV, so after sending me out (still throwing up in the blue bags they give) I waited a whole 2 hours to be called to the other side and they put me on a bed in the hall! After sitting on the bed for over an hour the Dr on that side told me i was not feeling well because of my period and that there was NOTHING wrong with me! Y'all I was so mad, so dehydrated and still throwing up I just walked out. How can this "Dr" tell me I don't feel good from my period?? I have a surgery scheduled in 2 weeks and I am so scared and nevrvous to do it at this hospital. If the ER staff are that uncaring, boy am I in for a big surprise!< /Text><username>Katy Roberts 100</username></record>

<Text>There is a reason why this place went from HOSPITAL to MEDICAL CENTER and it can't be for any good reason's right. Well after multiple bad experiences here if we need urgent care we go to Visalia and if it was for the kids we went to the children's hospital up north. I can go off an multiple near death experience from friends and family members but only know of 1 good experience and that was with me in 2008 and that's the reason for 2 stars and not just 1. Well you are more then welcome to come in for your self and create your own experience if you haven't yet. Lol< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The only thing positive about sierra view its proximity. But if you want good and fast service best make the trip to visalia. The employees dont even want to be treated there and that says something!<//Text>

< Review>
Sorry but my mom always told me I'd you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all. For this one time in going against my mom's suggestion. The emergency room is horrible. My sister in law was in the emergency room for over 7 and half hours waiting to be admitted into the hospital. She actually saw 2 Dr's, andthey both had different opinions. I really felt the Dr's were very incompetent. I'm sorry to have to leave a review like this because this is the hospital in my own town and we have no other options except to drive to Visalia over 30 miles away. All this money they're putting into this emergency room/Hospital has no made it even a little better.</Review>

Hospitals should have high standards. One thing wrong ruins the experience cause well its your or your loved ones life on the line. Ive seen sick contagious people on the same floor as people being wheeled in for surgery. Long waits to see anybody. Me and my girl had our baby here and i been here for 24 hours and counting and they have refused to give me food so i have to leave my girls everytime i get hungry and that gets expensive and makes me feel like im not there for them as much as i should be. And one night we went to see our baby in the nursery and no nurses were at the station. One fonally showed up and we asked her to help us get in cause we needed to feed our baby and she grabbed her paperwork that was unrelated to what we were doing and ignored us after talking to us. We had to wait for 2 more nurses to show up before one of them let us in. Its a shame cause there are some nice people here but a few bad things ruins the entire experience cause well its a hospital and we should expect the best from somthing thats supposed to save lives<//text>

The OB / Labor Floor was great while i had went into labor and finally got sent from the ER . While i was giving labor my sons Dr.Lisa Garbner she was great. They worked as team and it went fast . Now being discharged took sooo long. But the ER experience was horrible . Extremly worried my son at 2 months got a high fever of 101.4 and has went has as 102.1 extremly dangerous for an infant. As we wait...... for what flt like 2 hours my son kept jerking and shaking.i had thought  he was going in to shock. So i ean to get a nurse. And it tokk almost 10 min . For her to find the doc. And as he checked my son and what i mean is just looked him over and felt his temp he said okay.... now tell me why u are cryjng.... and i said what ? Why i am crying ? What do u mean ? Look at him why does he kepp doing that (as he crys so much he cant evn brethe. ) he says what do u mean hes a baby hes guna cry.  And i tolf him no he dont cry l ike that there gots be something wrong. Thwy just smerkdd and asked me .. os this ur first baby. ? I repky yes. And he smiled and said okay ill just send my nurse to get blood and  and urine sample  with took them over 3 times to gwt the neddle in because the nurse didnt seem to have a clue or was pre pared . Rolling around the room. With a baby layin crying woth a needle in his arm a women hold him down .  And he needs to grab a diffrent need be cause he missed ....thats not the nurse  put the cathiter in him wrong one time and had to do it agaain . Still no pee till she took it out n he peed all over the. Bed the she stck a bagg in him that was sealed properly. Times and experiemces like this make u wanna learn home medicines ir remides  or make u wish u had a car... if u ever come. Here for somethinv simple...id rather call my doc n schedual an apt. Then wait for 16-18 hours for a doc and assistance.

<Time>1497197734684<//Time><rate>1</rate><Review>We only go to this ER if the emergency is so bad that we can't make it to Kaweah 40 minutes away.  I recently had to go to ER.  I couldn't talk but was aware of everything.  The doctor was RUDE!  To say the nurse & phlebotomist were BAD would be a step up.  They couldn't get any blood so they stuck me >25 times including feet, neck, back...  I had the bruises for 2 weeks to remind me!   The urine sample was worse but I won't go into that.  There is 1 wonderful nurse that kept checking up on me but I wasn't lucky enough  for him to be my nurse.   After it was all said & done, they sent my CONFIDENTIAL (HIPA LAW!) records to 2 doctors' offices without my consent!
A couple years ago my husband was admitted to SVDH for 5 days.  They were "waiting for a consult from Stanford" (really? Stanford made you wait 5 days???) and forgot to give him the prescribed medicine after the first day.  I begged them to send him to Fresno or Stanford but they refused. Finally they released him  at 8 PM on the 5th day.  He was back in ER 6 hours later.  THANKFULLY that ER doctor recognized the true emergency & personally handled the transfer, by ambulance, to Fresno where he underwent emergency surgery.   That neuro-surgeon  said my husband should have been dead or a vegetable due to how serious he was.  Thank God for miracles & watching over him!
I DID have a good expedience in the OB department when I delivered my baby (13 years ago! )The nurses & doctors in the Labor & delivery ward are WONDERFUL.  Many are still there 13 years later.   Still its not appropriate to give an extra ☆. I'd write a separate review and give it ☆☆☆☆ but that wouldn't be a true reflection of the hospital as a whole.  SVDH needs CHANGE!   Maybe they need to NOT have 4/5 board members be doctors!!<//Review>< Pictures>

They should have staff in Emergency Room that aren't on their phone!!! Went up feeling sick to ask for a bag and older lady was on her phone and looked up until she saw me. I asked for a bag and she comes back and gives me pads!!!! If she wasn't too busy looking at your phone maybe she would of been listening!!! Ridiculous.</text>

My boyfriend and I came in to order some takeout. The service was great, the kitchen staff hustled, and the food was some of the best I've had in a long time! I am so happy we have some leftovers for tomorrow.</review>

Very impressed with not only the taste of the food, but the presentation of the food! Very friendly staff! From the moment we walked in, we felt welcome. They have the best tasting seafood, very fresh! & to top it off they had the option of fresh squeezed orange juice for our little girl! Definitely coming back and highly recommend it!</Text>

The molcajete is great, but the tacos are greasy.  Quiet enough to relax after work and watch a game without being overcrowded.<//review>

<name>Luc *<//name><Review>Wife and I got sick after eating here. One of the young girls working there probably family was eating food of someone's plate. They tried closing the little kitchen doors after noticing I was observing them. Won't eat here again. Food wasn't really that great probably shouldn't have went through with finishing our meals and avoided the upset stomach. Just our experience though.<//Review>< response>

Called ahead of time to make sure they had a certain size and brand of tire and they confirmed they did over the phone. Drove almost an hour to get there and finding out they didn’t have the tire they said they had. Had to wait over an hour and half for them to bring the tire from their other location here in Modesto after they said it would only take about 10-15 minutes. Will that was a lie!<//Text>

I took my car there couple years ago for repairing flat tire. When they brought my car back I saw damage on my rear bumper.
When I complain about it, they said that I have to call them back because they need to check the cameras. But when I called them they said they couldn’t see anything in video. They also refused to show me the video. I saw my car when they took it and I was 100 percent sure that they did it, but they were lying to me.< /text>

I believe honesty that they deserve 0 stars. I went there around 4:10 today may 24th 2020 and they said they’re close when clearly is says 5. What kind of business is this where they can’t stick with their words. If it say you close at 5 why are you closed at 4:10. Then he lied to me saying the doors where closed when clearly several doors where open.</review>

<Review>I bought rims from the Manteca location and I went to their Modesto tire shop for a tire rotation. I was greeted very fast and I asked if they could check out a shake I had in the steering wheel. They found out the problem was my brakes gave me a great price and fixed them right away. I always get excellent customer service thats friendly, fast & easy from this tire and rim company. Best part is that they have numerous locations in Modesto, Manteca, Tracy and elswhere throught the central valley so they are never too far away. I think they are the BEST TIRE AND RIM SHOP IN MODESTO AND MANTECA!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!< /Review>< username>

They told us that the lights were on before which was a huge lie. Now we have to pay even more money. They were so mean and unprofessional. Im currently filing a complaint with the board.

Honestly bad service! When I asked questions they were never answered on top of that rude customer service! When I went i felt like they push me to the side and to top it off when my car was ready they didn’t even call me a different costo we came up to me and told me my car was ready and that they were calling me but I didn’t hear them calling me and I was sitting like 7 steps away from the front area! Never going there again! If you want good service you’re deffinetly not going to find it here!.</review>

Walked in and asked the older worker for a price on used tires said 40$,  later asked another guy and price changed to 35$,  they really need to get everybody on the same page and see which one is it. Glad i asked. I Would of offered 5 stars if it wasnt for that situation because other workers and manager were really polite changed the tires within minutes thanks👍<//text>

They did the chamber kit front and back on my 2008 Dodge charger R/T and I'm very satisfied and happy with the price other were charging almost $2000 and I had to wait almost 4 to 5 days for parts and work amigos tire pros did it for little bit more then half the price and had my car done and ready in 2 days there very helpful and understanding of any situation also have 2 different types of payment plans make you feel like family I highly recommend them< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Should have read reviews before shopping here.. Everything was great and it slowly started to go down hill First my estimated delivery for my rims was not the one given i had to wait longer than what told. Second i had asked them to hold my old rims and tires and they did when i went to pick them up about 2 weeks later they had missplaced them they couldn't find them. 3rd the new rims i bought i had asked them to put locks on them but never received the key. Unfortunally i had a flat tire today and called them to ask for a suggestion since i couldn't remove the lugs well the person that answered the phone was very rude to come by the next bussiness day and he would find one for me. Not even the original key he was just going to give me any one. Well i explained that i had a flat tire and was stranded and asked for advice.He said i should tow my car i said "i am sorry sir you expect me to tow my car because you didn't give me a key to my lugs" he said "well you'r asking for an option" and at this time he had already raised his voice at me. I said well yeah because you are suppose to be the proffesional he answered well you can get a socket and try to removed them. Well here i am trying to find the socket and remove the lugs for 3 hours and not to mention stranded out of town with my kids. After trying so hard i had to drive my car damaging my rims to a close by Auto part store only for them to tell me that i was about the 4th person that they had done this too because that auto part store does the delivery for their parts and that they don't give out the lug keys to the customer... I am very very dissapointed with this place rude customer service if they would have done the job correctly and have gaven me my key to my lugs i wouldn't have had to move my car with a flat tire and getting my rim damaged it wouldn't of taken me 4 hrs to figure it out and get home... I usually never write reviews because i hate them but my self that works with customers all day and as a store manager i can say there is no communication between co workers no organization what so ever and really poor management. Really dissapointed in the service they offer first and last time i will ever purchase from them.< /review>< pictures>

<response>{'time': 1538508044815, 'text': 'Thank you for sharing, Rosa. We do not believe the paragraph above accurately describes the situation.  We understand you phoned the shop nearing the end of the business day. Although we were approaching the end of our day we provided you with multiple options: towing your vehicle to the shop so we can assist and stay open late, or checking with a friend/family member to see if they would assist with the socket and lug nuts. It is difficult for us to provide action when the vehicle is not at or near the shop. We take customer feedback very seriously and work hard to provide all with a 5-star experience. We are sad to see that you believe we fell short. We hope to have the opportunity to show you what it is that has made us into the successful and professional business we are now, in the future.'}<//response><Gmap_id>0x80905360b72cdac1:0xabf7d93721371af4</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Avoid this place!!! Horrible service!! Was supposed to pick up truck on Thursday but had to wait at shop on Saturday to finally get it! They didn’t get to install the grill even after the truck was kept there from Wednesday-Saturday afternoon. Also found a dent on the door of our brand new truck that was not there when we dropped it off! Take your money elsewhere!</review>< Gmap_id>

<text>Awful experience. Will never bring our vehicles to get serviced here ever again. If you have a nice vehicle I would not, I will repeat WOULD NOT recommend you to bring them here. The drivers DO NOT know how to park vehicles. They drove my nice car and smashed my bumper against the curb and cracked my bumper in 4 different areas. Luis was very unprofessional with the situation. Made me feel as if I was in the wrong. Did not want to take full responsibility for damage that was done. Driver admitted to driving vehicle against curb and Luis still had the nerve to say it wouldn't do that much damage to my bumper. Very unprofessional to treat a customer the way he did. DO NOT BRING YOUR NICE VEHICLES TO LOS AMIGOS. Luis was very unprofessional.   I'm a very unsatisfied customer.< /text>< Pics>

This is the worst place for tires or mechanical they tell you a price and then after the work they tell you another price way higher afterwards. I do not recommend this place and they get mad because you tell them that they don't keep their word and feel offended other places have better services and cheaper prices valen pura verga<//review>

(Translated by Google) I would give them zero stars or rather less 5 ... bad service until this date I await the call of luis k according to me they will replace my rim k was damaged from the first day my wheels were incomplete they were missing a cover I went and they took a photo of the Rin damaged and they will call me back to see if they would replace it or not, I really do not recommend them.

Tried the Bagel Pizza and I didnt really like it. Flavor wasn't good at all. I'd give that a 2 out of 10. Also had a mango smoothie and that was bad too. Had a chemical taste to it. Yuck.< /Text>

I LOVE THIS PLACE! She has the fluffiest donuts and the ice coffee is the best! I don’t drink coffee but I drink this one! Linda is so sweet and don’t get me started on the heavenly pizza bagels! If you want fresh good food, come here!</Review>

Amazing mom and pop donut shop. If you're looking for a quick and on the go breakfast or lunch this is your spot. Linda actually takes the time to get to know her customers and always remembers what her regulars like.</text>

<Review>I love the bagel pizza and i recommend it! You will be very satisfied because the other donut shop is no clean and rude employees but here is very kind, talkative, funny, etc. 🍩 i always come to this donut shop because they can actually cook good food! 5 stars for this donut shop!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Lucky donuts is the best donut shop. I've been coming here for so many years and it still taste amazing. I recommend the number 6 breakfast burrito it's a fire burrito. Awesome customer service and awesome experience.</Text>

All countertops are dirty, i can see dust all over the place and i noticed an icecream freezer thats out of order and there's a bunch of items stacked over it. The walls are stained the cash register looks to be greasy... I don't think i will ever be going back.

(Translated by Google) This place is for me a little corner where I can share with my children because since they started walking I brought them to eat their donut at Lucky Donuts and breasts. It is a wonderful custom because they have the best donuts and varieties of juices, tea and breakfasts for my children and I like to have breakfast in this place the atmosphere and the courtesy of the owners is fantastic I recommend them with not 5 stars with a hundred stars

Bought a new part from a different store but I couldn't get a sensor out of the old one. Though they could not find the right part I was just going to order brand new, they took time out of their day to break the nut loose out of the old part I broke, saved me 35 dollars and a lot of headache trying to get that sensor free.<//Text>

As a small shop owner, I rely on the local parts vendors for timely and accurate parts ordering, cross referencing and delivery. The staff at this particular Orielly auto parts has far surpassed any vendor i have delt with in my 17 years in the profession. If they dont have it, they will get it in a timeframe tha fits your needs. The biggest advantage of having a group of highly trained parts professionals at my disposal is that they understand the difference 10 minutes can make in the sale of a service depending on parts avalibilty and they always hual A$$ to deliver my parts and keep my business thriving. Good folks at the Pollock Orielly.< /text>

<Text>I have to say that not only is the management is wonderful, BUT SO IS THE STAFF!!!!!  I have met Robert outside O'Rielly... and he was always professional and friendly...I have also visited this location recently with various car problems.  No matter who was working any day, they all upheld a high level of professionalism and integrity.  I was especially impressed when I brought in a power steering pump housing completely unassembled, and a worker there helped me walk through the pump disassembly , reassembly and other important info.... I was blown away!!! These people really care about you and want your business! They will go the extra mile, and then some to get your car working at it's best!  As a automobile novice, I salute these folks!  No body wants car problems, BUT EVERYBODY wants someone with affordable and knowledgeable answers!<//Text>< Pics>

<Review>I appreciate the quick and friendly service that Gary provided for us today. My husband too in the car yesterday to remove a dent at the shop and when he brought it home I noticed that it wasn’t smooth as it should be. I called first thing this morning and Gary responded right away. He came to our home that afternoon and took care of it perfectly. Fast and professional service.</Review>< pics>

They have saved me so much money versus going to have my car repaired at a shop.  Love this family team.  They will accommodate your vehicle at any location and they work fast.  My car is always beautiful and ding free.  Saved me through the early years of my son damaging my car as a toddler/kid and now they repair his vehicle as a teenager.  Just love them at DentPro!!</text>< name>

<Review>Came to my house, arrived on time, explained everything and then got to work! My car looks good as new. I was not inconvenienced at all, it took me no effort and I did not have to drive anywhere or leave my car. They were fast, knowledgeable, and professional!

<review>I've used this Co. for many years, and always with excellent results.
I used to call them for dents and dings in my fleet of trucks before I retired.
I have also used them many times for my personal vehicles as well.
That includes but, not limited to, my $65,000 restored 1971 Camaro and, even a Harley Davidson (dent in gas tank).
I highly recommend.

<review>Gary came by on time. Was very friendly and professional. Did an excellent job fixing the dent on our car. Gary exceeded our expectations and we will only use Dent Pro in the future and I will ask for Gary to do the work. Very pleased with the process and results.

< Review>
After a year of searching I found a 2007 Subaru Outback Wagon in perfect condition. Recently a grocery cart put several dents in the passenger side front door, something I didn't think could be fixed without a big hassle. Cory from DentPro came to my home to try and 'massage' the dents. He was on time, polite and professional and within 15-minutes managed to return the door to looking like new, there is no evidence it was ever dented! Excellent work, I highly recommend DentPro!</Review>

They came to my house, fixed a dent in the door of my Dodge Challenger in less than 20 minutes, and  it looks perfect.

I can't even tell where the dent was.

Thank you!! 👏👏👏👏👏

I definitely recommend them and will seek their services again for future dent repairs.

<text>I just recently purchased a pre-owed 2010 Mercedes Benz S 400 in almost perfect condition with only 50,000 miles, she’s a beauty!  I inherited a few door dings on the car that I wanted to have repaired.  After calling around for quotes and hearing that a repair job like the one I was requesting was risky and my windows could break.😬  I shared this information with Cory, he assured me that I had nothing to worry about and he started the door ding repairs.  He did an Amazing job, it was like the dings were never there.  I would highly recommend these guys especially for high end-aluminum cars.  Thank you and I’m not a paid spokesperson.😃<//text>< pictures>

If you are particular about who touches your vehicle dont hesitate to call them to set up an appointment. I had a dent on the body line of my truck and they removed it at my house within 15 mins. Im the only one who ever does any work on my truck but once I seen the dent on my door I knew that was something I couldnt handle. I was able to get setup an appointment within the next 2 days. Shane came out and did a great job removing the dent. You would never be able to tell that it was there. I would recommend them to anyone who needs paintless dent repair done.

I have used Dent Pro for many years and in several different cities. I am a car enthusiast with a small collection, and they have fixed just about all of my cars. It's such a drag when you really take care of your car, just to have something happen, but it's comforting to know that they can work their magic and the dent is gone, even to trained eyes like mine. The process they use is not just physics or technical knowledge. It is magic! I always have their card with me 😁< /Text>

6 days after I bought my new truck, I was devastated to see that I had 2 dents in the rear fender.  I called DentPro Sacramento because I had gotten a referral for Cory.  Looking at the damage I was skeptical it could be fixed.  Well, was I wrong!  Cory came to my house and was able to make my truck look just like new.  I can’t recommend Cory and DentPro Sacramento enough.  I will definitely use them in the future.  If you are stressing about a dent in your vehicle call them now, you’ll be glad you did.<//Review>

Have used dent pro on several cars over the past 15 years or so.  I have always been satisfied with the quality of the results.  I have never been able to see where the repair was located after the job is done.  I do not hesitate from calling dent pro for any dings that happen to my vehicles.   I have had work done on my Porsche, 2 different BMW’s, Mercedes and a Mustang.</Text>

DentPro repaired car twice.  Once was unknown parking lot fender bash.  The other was for a contractor who damaged the car.  He was ready to pay a thousand dollars in what he thought a body shop would charge.  Got the estimate from DentPro and he was shocked ( and pleasantly surprised) that it could be done so inexpensively.<//review>

<Review>Corey did a great job on my car. The dent was a difficult one since it was a sharp one, deep, and on the body line, surround by yet a soft but large dent of about 4 inches. Four hours later, it looked like the dent was never there. Great skill and service!< /Review><time>1574984935587<//time><rating>5</rating>< response>

<Text>DentPro did an excellent job replacing my windshield.  Cory answered the phone, explained the process, gave me a fair price, and set up an appointment.  He came to my office and replaced it while I worked.
I would definitely recommend him to my family and friends.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I had a small dent in my trunk for years, and I could not figure out where it came from. Every time I would go to my car, it would stand out like a sore thumb to me, even though other people claimed they couldn't see it. I finally had the time to get the dent removed, and after doing some online research and checking reviews, I decided to use this company.

I called them to arrange a time to fix my car. They came to me to perform the work, which was great. If I recall, they were not open during the weekends and were only open during business hours during the week, which made arranging the service a little more complex. (I work in a gated parking lot and I can't have unauthorized vehicles in the lot) so I had to make arrangements to leave my car at my house while I was at work.

The car technician that fixed my car showed flexibility and picked up the keys from the leasing office and performed the work on time during the promised time window.

I did not enjoy the payment experience, which is why I only rated 4-stars. I was called by the technician after he finished the work and he asked for my payment information (while I was still at work and did not have a chance to inspect the work done prior to paying--remember, the vehicle was left at my house and I got a ride into work). The tech advised me that there will be pictures attached to the invoice I receive AFTER I pay him. It's a little backwards to see what you're paying for only after you've forked over your money.

Will I use them again? Yes, absolutely. They performed quality work at a decent price, and were punctual and had good availability. Will I still be uncomfortable coughing up money before I'm able to see the work performed, yes, who wouldn't? As long as the prices stay reasonable and they have good availability though, I'll be a loyal customer :)

Update: After I left the above review, a DentPro co-owner called me to thank me for the constructive feedback and to let me know that they thought my suggestion was helpful. They did NOT ask me to come back in and edit my review, but I am choosing to do so because I think it says a lot about a company that they monitor their Google reviews and took the time to look up my contact information in their internal system and call me for no reason other than to thank me for taking the time to leave a review and for pointing out a possible area of improvement. A lot of companies these days would get defensive when possible areas of improvement are identified, but they demonstrated a willingness to improve and open-mindedness that is difficult to find in a business these days. Because of the improvements being made to the pre-payment photo review process I am adding that one star back.<//Text>

<Time>1571256665548< /Time><text>Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Cory was able to take out multiple dents. Long ones on the front. Small ones on the door.  And ugly ones on the front of the hood from rocks.  I am thoroughly impressed.  You never know what you’ll get when getting dent removable.  I have seen some terrible work.

He was not only professional. But he did it quickly and as a last minute request.  My wife and I couldn’t be happier.  I will definitely use his services again.

I think the greatest compliment is referrals.  I am recommending that everyone get a hold of DentPro and ask for Cory.

Thank you again!<//text>< rate>

If the body shop has to take apart your car to repaint the damage, when they put it back together it will never fit as tightly as new. Best bet is not to take apart your car and go paintless. In my case, Cory had to remove a tail light to get behind the dent, but the repair is flawless. DentPro was able to make an appointment quickly, the repair took a matter of minutes, and they come to you. I would easily give them a shot first.</text>< pictures>

Very well run organization that provides real value to car restoration market.
I had three estimates, from $1800 to $2250, to repair a dent on my car. Someone suggested I call Dentpro. Very glad I did as they were able to do a great job for $325.
They came to my house, went about their task in a  very professional manner, and took a little less than an hour to complete the entire job. I was so happy that I asked them work on another small dent that had always bothered me, but that I had given up on having repaired.
Happy to have the opportunity to speak up for Dentpro. Will call them again without hesitation if the need ever arises.</review>

<Review>Fast and professional! I called them for a small dent on my door and they answered the phone right away. They came out to my work and fixed it right there in the parking lot. They explained what they did, what damage they could not fix (a tiny dot of missing paint), and warned me the spot is soft so the dent could reappear. It did not cost an arm and a leg and a year later the door is still dent free. I will be giving them a call if I ever need their services again.<//Review><UserId.>104066400051229225501</UserId.>< Name>

I use DP all the time, I’ve used both Sacramento & Sonoma DP’s and they always amaze me, outstanding work at a fraction of the price & hassle of a body shop. I have 2 cars including a 2002 Ranger Edge that looks new thanks to DP, I get tons of compliments on that  little truck. They also do all our race team vehicles and they keep us looking good! Thanks!</Review>

If anyone out there saw and took the time to read my last review of DentPro, you need to read on.  Soon after posting my last review concerning a disappointing experience with DentPro, I received a phone call from store owners Laurie and Gary Kleinfeldt.  The two were very concerned about my negative experience with their business and set out to make amends.  I could tell by our conversation of their sincerity.  They apologized for my loss of time and asked if I would consider giving them another opportunity show why DentPro is the best in Sacramento.  Well, fast forward a couple of days and Gary shows up at my house to do the work personally.  The results were amazing to say the least!  I pride myself in admitting when I am wrong, and boy was I ever this time. To receive a phone call from the store owners tells me everything I need to know about a business.  They will continue to have my business in the future and I encourage everybody in need of paint less dent repair to give these guys a call.  You won't regret it.  Thanks, Gary and Laurie!</text>

I bought a new 2019 Ram limited and somehow got a door ding, dentpro fixed it and a month later I got another one 😡. No problem Dentpro came to the rescue and it looks brand new again! They really know what they are doing and are very responsive. I highly recommend!😉</Review>

These guys came highly recommended from the Toyota Dealership.  The Bottom line is they got the job done right the first time and made the door dent left by some butthead disappear.
The size of my dent was about a nickel sized dent on my at the time Brand new Truck. I couldn't sleep at night knowing this dent was there. I did some research and asked the dealership who they would recommend looking for a good referral. They told me DENTPRO's of Sacramento. I called and made an appointment they showed up on time and in about 15 minutes my baby was perfect again. I hope to never have to use DentPro's again honestly but if I do I would not call any other company. That is the best thing I could say, I hope they feel the same knowing they earned my loyalty as a customer.<//text>

<Review>I was a bit skeptical when I started researching paint less dent repair and was not impressed with the way the other paint  less repair companies treated me while I was getting estimates.

Gary at Dent Pro looked at the damage on my vehicle  and assured me that he could perform the repair . I was pleasantly surprised when I picked up my vehicle today .

Gary did an amazing job!. I highly recommend Dent Pro to anyone including my family and Friends .

Thanks Dent Pro !

I highly recommend DentPro for all of your Paintless Dent Removal needs. Cory showed up promptly when he said he was going to and did an outstanding job getting two dents out of two different vehicles. He did such a good job I wasn't even sure where the dents had been. Made both of our vehicles look brand new again. Thank you DentPro, you have a loyal customer although I am hoping we don't have to call again anytime soon. Hoping my wife and the garbage can will stay out of each other's way.< /review>

I had originally posted a poor review for this business after a miscommunication with the office staff. Cory gave me a call back immediately to try and sort out the miscommunication. Very professional and timely. When we met in person, we were able to talk and figure out something that worked for my situation. Completely changed my opinion on the poor situation. Thank you Cory!</Review>

<Review>I use Dentpro past 12 years and they service my race cars, sports cars and family haulers whenever needs arise.  Gary and his son Corey are fantastic with excellent communication.  They do the best work in Northern California hands down.  Corey fixed a subpar dent repair on my Prius recently and it looks amazing as usual.  Would highly recommend their services without hesitation.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>{'time': 1571361512626, 'text': 'Thank you Michael!

I had my 1991 BMW 325is completely repainted a little over a year ago. It was perfect. Somehow/somewhere, I don't know how, but I got a little annoying dent near the gas filler door. Most people wouldn't notice it. But it bugged the heck out of me. I finally decided to try out a paintless dent removal specialist. DentPro had good reviews so I got a quote and scheduled a repair. Brandon the technician was great, he let me look over his shoulder and showed me how the speciality tools worked. He did a perfect repair! My BMW is flawless now and the universe has returned to order. Thank you DentPro and especially Brandon.< /Text>

<Review>Great job and great service from Cory. He came to my workplace in Rancho Cordova to pop my dent out on my van within 10-20 mins tops. If you ever need a dent to be pushed back out don’t be hesitant to give Dentpro a call and have Cory come out. He did an awesome job making it looked like the car was never dented. Thanks Cory!< /Review>< pictures>

Impressive work! I called out Cory from Dent Pro to remove a dent in my brand new F-150. My truck was hit in a parking lot within a week of having it, and I never thought it could be fixed so well. Dent Pro's services were quick and convenient as well as top notch. Prices are more than fair for this amazing service and skill. My go to source for any future dents!< /Review>

<Review>Lazy, uncaring customer service.

I scheduled a 9:30 appointment over the phone, and when I showed up at 9:33, a completely uncaring, unfriendly "receptionist" (who was just moments earlier browsing facebook at his computer and switched to the corporate website just as I walked in) told me that their appointment book read 9:00, that I was half an hour late, and that the technician had moved on to another job.

I explained that I had scheduled for 9:30 and that this was not my fault. The look on his face read "I don't care" without him actually having to verbalize it. His eyes glazed over as I spoke. So he rolled into "Well, we can reschedule you..."

Summary: They incorrectly set up my appointment, cancelled my appointment, and didn't even make a courtesy call to see if I was on my way but just stuck in traffic. They just assumed I was a no-show and moved on. Lastly, the lackluster customer service made me wish I was standing in line at the DMV instead. It is quite possible that the technician (there's only one) is competent and hard-working, but my experience at the front desk told me that they didn't want my money, nor were they interested in fixing my dent. So do yourself a favor and take your business elsewhere. Apparently, these guys believe that making money in this economy is so easy that treating customers like crap is acceptable.</Review>< Response>

Cross Word Christian Church has been our home church for over a year, and wow, God moves here. Pastor teaches straight from the bible and his style helps me understand how to apply it to my day to day life.<//review>

Wish I could give this testing location 0 stars. I took a COVID-19 nasal swab exam on 06/23/2020 and when I called today, on the 5th day when my results should be ready, they told me that my test had been cancelled because the tube was not closed properly and the liquids leaked. They cancelled my test without notifying me whatsoever.  I urgently needed these results because I started feeling symptoms on 06/26/2020 and the only solution they offered me is to get called to be rescheduled for an exam. I am out of options and choosing to go to the emergency room instead. Please save your time and do not get tested here.</Text>

Tracy and her assistant Matt were great in helping me refinance my home plus an equity cash out.  I am self employed so it required some extra effort but I always felt Tracy and staff were there to help me along the way.  Highly recommend.< /Review>

My experience with Tracy has been outstanding. I have worked with her on 2 deals so far and she is fantastic. Extremely helpful throughout the process and always has a positive attitude to any problems that may arise. Whenever I needed questions answered, she is very quick to respond and help me out. Can't wait to work on more deals with Tracy.<//review>

My husband and I just completed a transaction of purchasing a home.  The team Jodi Fischer and Silvia Newman were a hard working team for us.  The tag line Loan Warrior is very fitting. They were on the ball daily making sure that every thing went smoothly.  I would recommend This team to anyone!< /Review>

<text>If I could give Tracy Bolen more stars, I would!  She really and truly went above and beyond for us...I think she stressed out more when things didn't go smoothly than we did!  Through NO FAULT OF HER OWN, our process had some bumps and dips due to different state issues and other things, but she went to bat for us all the way through it and we communicated every step of the way.  She was truly a pleasure to work with!</text><Name>Julie Tannock<//Name><Date>1620766201375<//Date>< GmapID>

I highly recommend Kevin based on three things that I love about him and have helped me personally. Kevin is knowledgeable, honest and caring. What I am going to share with you about him, also extends to his team and his company, but I am going to focus on him here.

Knowledgeable: Kevin is passionate about his job, and that energizes him to remain up-to-date and informed about any opportunities or challenges that your loan may encounter, and he confidently and calmly plans and guides you accordingly. He does not speculate when there are unknowns, but he and his team investigate on your behalf, and provide you with the facts. This quickly translated into trust between us when we began working together which allowed me to follow his guidelines efficiently.

Honest: Kevin does not exaggerate or downplay, but he informs you. That for me is always a sign of the respect that a person extends to you. Tell me the truth, and let me decide what it means, right? He gets it naturally. Kevin is punctual for the things that he can control, and is great in communicating what to expect for the things that he cannot control (oh those meticulous underwriters!) Also, Kevin takes responsibility when there are any mistakes on his side. Our first interaction that won me over was how he handled my complaint about a misunderstanding involving people who worked under him. He listened patiently, explained his opinions and addressed the issue to my satisfaction. I felt zero defensive tone in his words and action. I was truly impressed.

Caring: Kevin is a caring man. He is personable. He is interested in you and your stories. He remembers what you care for and what you are concerned about even if you lose touch with him for months. I enjoy my calls with him and probably take too much of his time with my stories but he is kind of a man who is genuinely interested in you and your dreams. When you cross the finish line, you feel that he is genuinely cheering for your success, and if there is a stressful moment in the process you feel he is beside you and not on the other side of the table shrugging his shoulders.</text>

We were delayed closing on our house by 3 weeks because he didn’t have any sense of urgency. Instead of 6 weeks, we closed in 9 weeks and we were very close to losing our house because of it. Simple papers to sign that would have taken 2 seconds to email were sent weeks later and that contributed to the delays. He didn’t communicate throughout this process at all. We had no idea where we were and what needed to be done because he couldn’t send a quick email of “hey, I need these statements”. Statements that were sent instantly as soon as I knew he needed them. He didn’t do his due diligence when it came to verifying what type of property we were purchasing and therefor we lost a loan because they don’t loan to a rural property. This also contributed to the massive delay. I emailed him regarding a serious matter, and he never emailed me back because he had no idea that we were even going to go with the credit union that sent me information to sign! Spoiler alert- I didn’t mess up, but it would have been nice to get a response to know that I didn’t just financially ruin myself.

I have a very long list of why you should never work with Shawn, those are just a few.

If you want communication and you want to close on time, don’t work with him.

On a positive note, we closed and received our keys on Christmas Eve.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Working with Tracy Bolen and American Pacific Mortgage was smooth and seemless.  Tracy is a consummate professional whose knowledge and acumen ensured that I was expertly taken care regarding all aspects of the mortgage application and processing.   So happy to have worked with her and would highly recommend her to anyone looking to refinance their home loan.</Review>

As a first-time homebuyer, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. Emelia Marini with American Pacific Mortgage made the whole process extremely easy and enjoyable. She was patient, calm, and took the time to explain even the smallest details so I could feel confident in my decisions.  I was pleasantly surprised by her quick responses to emails and texts, as well as her willingness to talk me through different processes on the phone. When my bank put up a small roadblock, Emelia was able to come up with several solutions to keep the ball rolling and not delay closing. I have already recommended her to friends and will continue to do so in the future.<//text>

He is very thorough, easy to communicate with, never misses a deadline, and keeps you in the loop about everything. He is great with following up, gets back to you very quickly if he’s not immediately available. I like that he gives us the conservative, worst-case scenario, so we have been pleasantly surprised when our payment always ends up being less than projected instead of more. He is very up front about all fees, and is willing to explain anything in terms you can understand. He is your guy!!</review><name>Ashley Cowan</name>< gmapID>

Throughout the entire loan process Chuck was very professional, he communicated  with me, replied to all of my questions and concerns with a quick response time. Time was very sensitive for me with needing to secure a home loan still Chuck and his team made it happen and I closed on a beautiful 4 bedroom 4bath home Jan, 20, 2021 with 3.2% fixed! I would recommend Chuck to all of my friends and family!<//text>

<Review>American Pacific Mortgage seem to only employ top talent!! I have done loans through APM for new homes and investment properties, as well as refis in both CA and TX. Tony Close was my rockstar loan officer for the CA loans and for TX I had the awesome team of Connor Pollock and Jenny Patricio. Their professionalism, efficiency and responsiveness was unparalleled. Attention to detail is critical in lending, to avoid delays, set backs and frustration. I have purchased 10 properties throughout the years and poor lenders/brokers can make the experience so stressful/dreadful. My transactions with these individuals at APM made the process easy and even perhaps enjoyable :-); I would highly recommend them to make home buying a bit less stressful as they are on top of their game at all times, super friendly and even bring a bit of humor to the crazy lending process.<//Review>< Date>

<pictures>None< /pictures><review>I worked closely with John Gremm and Chuck Jarrad III in getting our mortgage application approved by the VA and American Pacific Mortgage.
Their quick response to any questions or issues I raised was extremely helpful in leading us through the process, including all of the extra requirements of VA paperwork.  When I called John for assistance, he either picked up the phone immediately or called back within a few minutes.  APM provided excellent customer service throughout the process and the closing actually happened on schedule and without any complications.  I strongly recommend APM, Chuck, and John to guide current home owners and new buyers through the new mortgage process or a re-finance of their existing home.  No other company has been this helpful and professional in meeting our refinancing needs.  I respect and trust both of them, and thank them for their help.</review><rate>5<//rate><Response>None</Response>< user_name>

The whole process was painless!  The fact they have an app for signing documents was a huge win.  We loved having the ability to take care of things quickly from our phones and not having to rely on finding emails.  Overall, we had a fantastic experience.< /Text>< Pictures>

We worked with Tracy to refinance our house and she was very responsive! She gave us a great rate and the app to turn in documents made the process so much easier. I was able to upload everything on their. I highly recommend Tracy!<//text>

Where do I start!? From the very beginning they have the MOST helpful with the mortgage and home buying process. Being a first time home buyer I naturally reached out to my own credit union and other local banks to no avail and very little help and direction. I ended up getting connected with American Pacific Mortgage and the loan originator Ms Wendy and everything began to fall in place! She gave us a realistic loan approval and explained our options. From the beginning to the very last day (signing day) she helped us with every step. Always within a phone calls reach. Always willing to help and guide us. She did a terrific job educating us on our options and really made us feel comfortable with the home buying process. If you are in need of a mortgage loan, this is definitely the place! They are honest direct and most of all helpful with the process. No unnecessary fees tacked on to the loan which was a major plus! Thanks again For all of your help! I’ll be back when it time to buy another one!<//review>

Nidia helped my family with our first home purchase.  She was professional and  knowledgeable about the different loan scenarios available to us.  She was a great communicator, always available for questions and was efficient answering them ALL.  Our loans closed smoothly and on schedule. She was able to get us a great rate and we couldn’t be happier with the experience. I would recommend Nidia  for all your home loan needs.</Review>

I highly recommend Preferred Rate. I was in the middle of refinancing my mortgage with my lender when I had a question. They came highly recommended by not one, but two of my friends - and I see why.

Richard Hanover and his team were able to get me a much lower rate than I was being offered by other lenders. He also explained to me how I could drop my PMI if I brought a little extra money to closing - which is going to allow me to save quite a bit of money over the next few years. My previous lender didn’t even mention this option during the process.

I’ve bought a few homes before and I’ve refinanced once before, but the process was easier and quicker than any of the other times. And they went out of their way to make sure I had a really good experience.

I can’t recommend Richard and his team enough. I really appreciate all the work they put in on my behalf.< /Text>

We worked with Jose Menendez, and he is the most experience loan officer I’ve ever meat. From the beginning of the process of getting qualified to the day we closed, he was always responsive on any questions or concerns. He was also extremely careful to give us the best Loan and rate possibly for our needs. Look no farther if you like professionalism, experience, and extremely good communication. Thank you Jose for all you help!</text>

I owe a lot to this company and their team.  I was going through a divorce, in Forebearance on my previous mortgage and trying to fix my credit.  Alan Plat was my loan officer helping me with my refinance.  But before I go into this Phillip was the person that I watched on youtube that helped me to realize that their was hope for me in the storm I was in.  Many companies said they could not help me while I was in Forbearance but American Funding reached out to me.  They looked at my financial situation and gave me an honest opinion on what I needed to do to get my house refinanced.  They help me get my credit fixed,  pay off debt, and also gave me a path going forward to make sure I am never in this situation again.  I can’t thank then enough for the help they gave me.  If you or anyone you know is wanting to find a way out of a financial storm and to get your house refinanced.  Please contact this company.  They have my highest recommendation and respect.  As I am a veteran who just retired right at the begin of COVID and no one was hiring.  This company was patient with me and once I was able to find employment helped me get back on track while ensure the refinance process was smooth.  They even found a lien that had been placed on the house due to divorce mess.  Thank you for everything.  And when I refinance again this will be the company I use.  10 stars.< /Text>

Second time refinancing in one year with APM and nothing but good things to say. Kristi is amazingly responsive and patient, and Tracy is so prompt and efficient with paperwork. The rate is incredibly, but the most impressive thing is how low the closing costs are. Less than half of what we were quoted from American Financing<//review>

We worked with Paul Gaston to refinance our mortgage twice now, each time saving us a whole percentage point and thousands of dollars. With this last remortgage, we were not only able to make our monthly payments lower, but also shortened the length of the loan overall. Paul is very thorough and walks us through the process, explaining everything clearly and in a way that makes me feel comfortable asking any questions I may have. I HIGHLY recommend working with him and often give his contact info to anyone I know looking to buy a house. I honestly wouldn’t trust anyone else with it.</Text>

Now, with these record low interest rates we decided to refinance. I contacted Jose and he was on it. He found us a great new rate on our VA loan. The process was so smooth. Any questions you have Jose has the answer. He is looking out for his clients and always trying to find the best rate possible. To purchase or refinance look no further.

<Review>I was pleased with my entire loan process from contact to closing. Gerald White, my loan officer, performed splendidly along with his dynamic fellow staff Kathy, Jason and Brian. The process was seamless and professional throughout. The legendary duo, "Batman and Robin" never worked more closely together than did those four in resolving issues and time lines that I would have found overwhelming. I felt like a newborn that had taken its bottle, went peacefully asleep, and awakened to find the whole process efficiently completed. My gratitude to their entire staff. Great job!!<//Review>< pictures>

<rate>5</rate><review>Gary Krakowski and his team knocked it out of the park with their services. As a first time home buyer, I didn't know what to expect; however, all my concerns dissipated quickly after just one phone call. Gary and his team allowed for a stress free, streamlined and smooth process as a first time home buyer. Despite the obstacles COVID-19 presented, Gary and his team were very informative and kept an open line of communication throughout the entire process. Aside from their proactive and friendly communication, Gary and his team were very informative and patient, which was much appreciated as a first time buyer. Throughout the process I genuinely felt Gary and his team were looking out for me and my interests, as I didn't get the corporate, impersonal vibe you'd typically expect with other services. Will definitely recommend to friends and family, and to anyone reading this now... you won't be disappointed!</review>< Pics>

Angie went above and beyond for me on this transaction, I explained my needs to her and she surpassed them. She was available for me at all times especially when I had questions (I had plenty), even when she was extremely busy, which is highly appreciated. Angie was very transparent,  incredibly knowledgeable, courteous and patient. I went through a few offers on properties before my final purchase and Angie was there to help through each and every one of them often coordinating with my agent behind the scenes. I couldn't have asked for better support throughout such a stressful process. Thanks to Angie I am now a proud homeowner!

<Review>We have worked with Dave a number of times in gaining financing for both our home and rental properties.  He has always done great work for us, getting the best rates available and negotiating the oftentimes difficult maze of underwriters and regulations.  He responds in a timely manner to our requests and needs.  He operates in a very professional and personal manner, which is always a good combination of skills.  I plan on working with him in any future property purchases we make.</Review>< Pics>

We were refinancing the current mortgage and prepared for the long and stressful process from day 1. But John took care of everything and the refinancing process is easy, painless and straightforward like applying for a new credit card! Highly recommended and will definitely work with John again for my future mortgage needs.</text>< Pics>

Kyle Wright of American Pacific Mortgage is a consummate professional. He was recommended by my real estate agent to help us with a transaction we thought would be relatively straight forward but ended up being somewhat complicated.  Kyle is a creative problem solver and through every step of the process kept things moving, came up with ideas to help us through obstacles and always kept us in the loop. Kyle and his team were very responsive, explained things to us so we understood what issues we were facing and they always had a solution. Our refinance transaction was processed expeditiously.  Kyle and his team are awesome! I would not hesitate to work with Kyle again.</Text>

Rich was the best! He was very involved throughout my entire homebuying process, and went above and beyond in SO many areas. As a first time homebuyer, he carefully walked me though everything every step of the way. From the onset he was very in-tune with my needs and made sure I was comfortable within my monthly budget, not just based on my debt to income ratio. He also provided great personal perspective on buying a condo in Chicago specifically. I felt prepared and informed from my very first showing through closing. Highly recommend!</text>

Very pleased with the service I received getting my re-fi. I will say it took a good bit longer than I expected and with more paperwork in the past, but I was told that this was mostly a result of COVID and demand for new loans.  My broker was helpful and responsive to me every step of the way.< /Text>

The company in diamond bar goes above and beyond. Samuel Castorena keeps you updated in every stage of your loan.  There were times where I had needed the follow-up and reminders and they were so professional throughout. The staff is friendly and courteous. They are also technically advance w their program and e-signature process especially during COVID where you don’t want to leave your home. Please check the company out and talk to Sam.</text>

Before finding APM, I used another major mortgage originator, and it took almost 3 months because they took on too many applications.

We could not have been more pleased with Tracy Schroeder and her team at American Pacific Mortgage. They handled our refinance with utmost professionalism and expediency. Their communication was consistently clear and helpful. APM's app, too, was easy to use! I highly recommend  them.</review>

<text>APM was incredibly fast at turning around my documents and requirements, and I was able to refinance in under 30 days.  Before finding APM, I used another major mortgage originator, and it took almost 3 months because they took on too many applications.  By moving my refinance over to APM, I lowered my rate and closed much quicker.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>I would recommend Angela Qawi 1000x over.  She was so helpful throughout the entire process, even for a first time homeowner like me who had a million questions.   Thank you so much Angela for working to keep me in the monthly payment budget I asked for and even lower.</Review>< Pics>

<review>Jenny is Conners assistant and is honestly THE BEST. Always helpful, always answers the phone when you call and is quick to act.

You will NEVER get ahold of Conner and he will NEVER call you back. Ever. I know we are all busy and very important but come on... it was a very frustrating experience.

From the beginning I had expressed multiple times that if possible I’d like to be in home in the 4th of January due to a new job starting. I was given a lot of false hope... I get it this stuff takes a long time. There are many people involved. But don’t say “ya it’s possible” then never tell me what’s going on.. I turned things in within minutes of receiving items and they on the other end took days-weeks to get processed. Deadlines where always drawn out.

So good luck to you buying your new home!<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None<//resp><Gmap_id>0x809ae77d9c8ff043:0x3ab43459f95be68e< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I worked with Peter Schilling. He was great. Clearly a numbers guy who doesn't mind (in fact, I think he kinda likes it!) running numbers on the spot for any scenario you throw at him as well as presenting some you may not have considered. He came up with an option that was better than the one I was going to use. Highly recommended.</text>

John Ruiz is hands down the best mortgage advisor I have every dealt with. I would highly recommend John Ruiz if you are in need of a new home loan, refinancing, or going through a divorce like myself and needing hand holding all the way through the process....
If I could give a rate of 10 stars I would.. I can't thank John and Dorothy enough for everything they did to help me secure my loan...< /review>

I was referred to Richard Honquest by my realtor, and I am very thankful he was the one who guided me through the process. He was always looking after my best interests, and regardless of his busy schedule he had always took his time to make sure I understood each and every step of the process. As this was my first purchase I'm sure I had asked many stupid questions, but he was always accommodating and understood where I was coming from.

I won't be looking at anyone except Rich for my future financial ventures, and will be working hard to hope that it becomes a reality where we can  cross roads again.< /text>

Although our loan application process met many bumps and turns in the road, all of which were out of APM's control, Tracy and her team were able to close the deal! Tracy followed through well and stayed on top of it.
Thank you!<//Text>

A+ Transaction. Quick communication, and follow up. Easy to get a hold of, never waited more then minutes for a follow phone call. Closed on projected close date when major curve ball was thrown at us. Will use Gary and his team for all future needs.<//text>

Chuck Jarrard was the loan agent for our first home. He was responsive, fair, and ultimately helped us achieve a closing in under 30 days (which in Phoenix is unheard of.) We can’t say thank you enough to all the hard work Chuck put in on our behalf. Thanks, Chuck!< /review>

Francesca Sourbis was our loan advisor. She was great from the first phone call until closing day. This was our first home buying process. We had 2 other lenders that we were dealing with before we came to American Pacific Mortgage, and we were not satisfied with customer service, interest rates etc.. We was referred to Francesca by our real estate agent. The moment we contacted her, we was pre approved in no time. She was so communicative through the whole process with emails, texts, and phone calls. She helped us get a decent rate. Also, It really helped to be able to text her after business hours to ask questions.  I highly recommend her.</Text>

<Text>I only have 3 words for Jorge Ramirez - ABOVE AND BEYOND! Jorge was helpful, explanative, available and not only answered our questions, but encouraged them! He went about and beyond every step of the way to make sure we understood a very new and complex process and that we were not only comfortable but thrilled with everything. Jorge really made our experience as first home buyers smooth and easy, and we could not more highly recommend someone to not only a first home buyer, but to any home buyer!</Text>< pics>

Great experience for our first home purchase. Worked with Rich Honquest. He was patient, thorough, and always willing to answer questions. Also, was willing to match competitors rate. Highly recommended.< /Review>

When loans are closing in 90+ days these days, i was able to close within a month for a refinance. Communication is great with Rodrigo, and his assistants/Closers, and almost efficient. All questions answered and explained thoroughly.<//Text>

I am so pleased to contacted Bob Bless and his Mortgage company. Bob and Ali Rodriguez helped me get my mortgage  with a great rate. The application was smooth and easy, at the closing they solved what ever little problems we encountered  and I am for ever grateful to them.

<text>Sean and his partners at American Pacific Mortgage helped us with the refinance of our home. It has been quite an up and down process with the pandemic but he managed to get it done at a great rate and for less years. We can’t thank him enough for the hard work he has put forth and I highly recommend him and American Pacific Mortgage.<//text></record>

<review>Mitchell Chernock is very friendly and personable, but there were times where he did not outright answer my questions, because he often would get sidetracked by telling a story about himself or someone he knows. I submitted the documents he and his team requested of me as quickly as I could, but there were times when his team lacked good communication within their own unit. On multiple occasions, I had Mitchell and/or different team members contact me for documents that I had already uploaded into their online portal days ago and those documents hadn't been reviewed in that time; they were just sitting there. Without my and my husband's consent, Mitchell tried to charge us a fee in order to lower our interest rate. He acted like he was the one who was able to give us such a great interest rate, but in reality, we were the ones who gave ourselves the lower interest rate, because he was charging us to buy points, which is something that we had not discussed or agreed to. On our loan disclosure, he had additional fees and no lender credit towards us. When we questioned him on this, he said, "Well, I have a company to run and employees to pay." He did not seem to care that as his clients (who have stable jobs and incredible credit scores) we have a family to care for. We decided to consult with another lender Ben Swett (who is amazing and we HIGHLY recommend), and he pointed out all of the questionable items on our loan disclosure. Ben helped us negotiate with Mitchell, so that we can get a better deal. Something I feel we shouldn't have had to do in the first place as his clients. Also, from the beginning, I disclosed to Mitchell during a phone call and on our loan application that we would be gifted some money from my parents. He said that was fine and didn't give me any further instructions. We deposited the check from my parents, and it wasn't until we were close to wrapping everything up, Mitchell told us that we need a copy of the check, which we didn't have. We spoke with our bank, and they told us that our lender could retrieve a copy of the check faster than we could, so we emailed the bank's instructions on how to attain a copy of the check to Mitchell and his team. Mitchell called my husband and alluded to the fact that he can't get a copy of the check, because it was illegal for him to do it, even though our bank said he could get it. Two of Mitchell's team members contacted me and asked me to get a copy of the check, and that's when I finally told them of my dissatisfaction with their service and how they're constantly making us jump through hoops instead of helping us throughout this process. Not once has Mitchell apologized to me or my husband for his lack of professionalism and reluctance to help us. He continued to act cheerful and go on as if nothing was wrong, and he would repeatedly say how he's worked so hard to get us a great deal, but at that point, it all felt very fake and narcissistic of him. Another thing, through the majority of this process, he only contacted me and would leave my husband out on emails and texts. I addressed the issue by telling him that he needs to include my husband in all communication, because we're buying the house together and my husband needs to be in the know of what's happening. Mitchell continued to only contact me even if it was my husband who was reaching out to him via text or phone call. I'm definitely not satisfied with Mitchell's actions and service.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x809ae77d9c8ff043:0x3ab43459f95be68e<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Jeff gets a A+++++,
For a first time client, he treated me like we have been doing business together for years. Without mentioning any institution directly, my mortage company that I had and have been over paying every month would not even work with me on a Refi. My own bank with my savings and checking at could not even get  call back..Jeff answered on the first ring and keep me up dated daily to the day we closed.</Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x809ae77d9c8ff043:0x3ab43459f95be68e</Gmap_id></record>

Thanks Said for the support and efforts to get financing process completed. My case was unique and complicated due to my work outside US. You fought for me to overcome obstacles.

I hope we can do more business in the future.

Well, JJ Mack and his team have crushed it again. They locked in an insane rate while cutting the term in half. Do yourself a favor and consider them to service your loan or refinance.  You will not be disappointed.< /Text>

Bottom line, if you want a lender who will be honest, straightforward, gives you true facts and doesn't put assumptions in your head, this isn't the company you want. Period.<//Review>

<text>Allessandro was awesome to work with. This is my 3rd time working with Allessandro and he always makes the process of applying for a mortgage super easy. His associate Jill was also very helpful in making sure things went smoothly. We closed on our refi in about 25 days. Would easily recommend them for anyone looking for a easy and quick mortgage process.<//text>< gmapID>

Jeff Larocco is so awesome he helped us to buy our home and walked us through every step.  We came from California and did not know anything about the loan processes in Illinois.  Then when the interest rates went down he helped us to refinance to get a much lower rate.   Thanks Jeff<//review>

Applied for a refinance. My Lender,  Vicky Orusa, has assisted us in the past. Her vast experience and knowledger, porfessionalism and friendliness helped us to smoothly go through this transaction. Even amid the Covid, this company is able to bring 5 star service.<//text>

This is the 2nd loan we have done with Frank because we had a good experience with him and his team the first time.

The process went smooth again, he answered all our questions again and he got us a low rate again.

I think he was looking out for us because we ended with a lower rate than what he promised when we locked it in.</Review>

I've been waiting for this opportunity to share my experience with the godsend that goes by the name Halee Epling Daily. This incredible woman gave me peace when I most needed it, and the skills and knowledge to successfully complete what can only be described is a very complicated transaction. Halee had to manage not only my real estate transaction, which was a contingent sale, but the pressing needs of the other two buyers downstream of my house sale which were also contingent sales. Not only did Halee provide me with regular updates; she was always willing to answer my many questions, and maintain contact with the other party to the transaction.  I cannot say enough good things about Halee. I will forever be grateful to her and will recommend her to anyone needing loan services.</Review>

It was a pleasure working with Steve! Funny story, I actually chose him randomly from the AP Mortgage website, looked at everyone's pictures and thought, "oh, he looks like a nice guy." AP Mortgage was the preferred lender for the property I purchased and unlike other lender websites, I didn't see a way to just apply for a loan on their website. There was just a form to fill in your information to have someone contact you to give you a quote. Well, I waited a day and no one had contacted me other than an email saying someone will reach out, so me being impatient, clicked around the website and found out I can send in an application after selecting a loan officer and visiting their page!

Anyway, Steve was great! He has experience working in this field for quite some time, so he was watching the market to get me a good rate. If anything important comes up that needs to be done right away, he always calls. Everything was a breeze, no huge hiccups. He takes the time to explain things in ways I can understand, since this is my 1st home, I didn't know much of the process at all.

I went into the process with certain expectations and knowing I would need to provide alot of documentation, so I think I already had most of what was normally required. Due to my personal circumstances, Steve suggested I provide more work history to show consistency and a letter with explanation of gaps. I thought it was a great idea to be extra thorough to submit all of it in one big package! I have read other's experiences where they feel annoyed that they have to keep submitting more because the underwriter keeps requesting additional information and I did not feel any frustrations regarding that at all.

I would definitely work with Steve again if given the chance and refer him to my friends and family :)<//review>

I was referred by a real estate agent to two Mortgage companies but I also wanted to interview a third one as well. I read the reviews on line about American Pacific Mortgage and being very impressed I selected them as my third option.  Right from the start JJ Mack at American Pacific Mortgage was a go-getter, very responsive, and communicative; he seemed to be two steps ahead of the other mortgage companies and got things done in a timely manner. I selected American Pacific Mortgage as my mortgage company.  JJ Mack took the time to help me through every step in the process and explained everything fully easing my mortgage anxieties.  He personally called me on multiple occasions updating me on the process and letting me know what to expect and when to expect it so we could meet our target dates.  JJ Mack is reliable and trustworthy and I know he had my best interest at heart and because of that I can't tell you the stress he took from me!  He is a professional in every sense of the word!<//review>

I wont come back. The two Mortgage brokers where  bob Enright and Camilla Papaioannou. If you want to deal with people that take you for granted  and not get back with you ever choose them. You will be the one calling them or texting them and maybe they will get back with you while your in the process of a refinancing. I guess they dont need customer's..<//review>

Matthew Hergert came highly recommended.  On our first meeting it was clear we wanted to work with him.  Matthew has such an illuminating personality.  It was his experience and knowledge and PATIENCE I appreciated the most. Our experience was such a pleasure from the beginning to the end.<//Text>

This is the worst Mortgage company to every deal with. Not only did I have a horrible experience (4 months) with the process of getting a home come to find out Melanie Overmoe and her team calculated numbers wrong and I seem to have to pay more money out of my pocket (escrow) even after signing my loan and moving in my home. Then come to find out they sold my loan to the the worst loan company 15 days after I signed my paper work and I had not even moved in yet with no notice. DO NOT DO BUISNESS WITH THIS COMPANY!< /Text>
