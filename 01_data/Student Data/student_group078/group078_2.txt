Impressive customer care! I went to the store to change my plan, and Phil made things very easy! He walked me through all my options, and focused on what would save me the most money. Surprisingly, I was eligible for an upgrade, so he helped me pick out a new phone. He devoted a lot of time and effort to make sure I was comfortable with my decision, and I knew every thing about my monthly bill.

The whole team was really on their game. They were very thoughtful and turned what could have been a frustrating experience into a fun social hour. During the final phases of the transaction, they experienced a technical issue that required the manager to call IT help. Phil was aware that this was going to require a wait so he offered to get coffee. It was a perfect break! By the time we came back, the manager had fixed the issue and we were ready to go!

Thank you so much, Phil and Capitola team! You are all amazing! Can't wait to come back to pick up my new tablet! :)<//Text>

<username>Ron Warren</username><Text>If I could give ZERO STARS I would.
I came to Sprint after many years with Verizon.
Since June 2016 I have been waiting for them to send me and my wife our Verizon contract buy put.
Every time I talk with the numerous managers they say "it's been escalated". "I will call you tomorrow". Do not believe it.
They took my phones, I have given them paperwork twice.
I HAVE NOT ONCE BEEN CALLED BACK.
I even talked with the District Manager 2 weeks ago , Pat Coniglio, "I'll call you back tomorrow". That never happened.
It's like they want to push you so hard that you'll snap and do something that lands you in jail.
LET THE BUYER BEWARE
Thanks for all your crappy service.
"The bitterness of poor service outlasts the sweetness of an imagined good deal".
Thanks Pat I thought you would be different.< /Text><Date>1490301285485< /Date>< user>

We are recommending to all our friends, that they should also switch to Sprint & go & get Phil's assistance.

<review>We were lied to after thoroughly asking about our out the door price, they added on another 35$.  One year later lied to about receiving a new phone (not refurbished) for insurance. Low and behold they gave me a refurbished phone. Record your conversations. The manager and the employees tell you what you want to hear to get you on contract. Be ready for spending 5 hours at this store as myself, my wife and a friend has all done.<//review>< Resp>

This place can't do anything with you Sprint phone or account.  Have tried a couple of times to make account changes at this location but they are not a corporate store and really can't do anything but sell you a phone.
Overall Sprint is the worst rated phone company and spending any time discussing service quality with a Sprint customer will tell you everything you need to know about why you shouldn't choose Sprint.< /Text>

<text>Pushy sales staff. They don't care about you, they just want you to give them a perfect score on the post visit survey. They told me, "Anything less than a perfect score is a fail, you don't want me to fail do you?" Word to the wise, I do not want you to fail but I don't want a guilt trip either. During the sale I felt like they would say whatever they thought I wanted to hear in order to sell me on more and more expensive merchandise. Unless there is some kind of miracle or they do something to make up for this unacceptable, obnoxious behavior I will not go here again. Worst experience I've ever had at a Sprint store!<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x808e159dd0961043:0x8bb0b9ae4242ce3a< /gmap_id></record>

<text>I went into Sprint today, desperate to pull pics off a 12 year old, deactivated phone without Bluetooth. These pics were of my son (the 4 legged kind) who very recently passed away and cables weren't recognizing the photos. Then, it showed the phone was in lost or stolen status!

Phil Atkinson, Asst. Mgr went ABOVE and BEYOND to make that happen for me, and for that I am eternally grateful. He sat on the phone with customer care to get that lock removed. We don't know yet if it will all work out, but thank you isn't enough.</text></record>

Worst customer service ever. RUDE. Phil helped me buy my phone. (At which time he explained nothing about my new phone and I had never had an I Phone) . He also told me what I needed instead of giving options to me. I switched from wifi to cable internet. My phone quit working. Apparently there are NO Sprint towers in my area. I called corporate. They said my account should have never been opened with no coverage. They are going to wave the rest I owe on my phone and told me to take it to the store for a refund. Phil was working. I had printed out the chat with the corporate saleslady to point out some things. He got very angry and rude and said that none of them were true. I asked him to call the manager. He pretended to but did not. We then asked to call corporate with him. 3 times in a row he said it would just frustrate us more and be a waste of our time. By the time we called they were closed. I have filed a formal complaint, and so has the head office. I have never been talked to in such a manner where I am spending my money. Phil seems to have an anger problem. BUT, that's not my problem.< /text>

<text>Anthony, the Sales Assoc., is excellent.  Always helpful, knowledgeable, friendly and patient.  I'm always impressed, and completely satisfied when I leave the store.

<text>My partner and I were attempting to take advantage of the online Sprint deal for one year of free cell service if you switch from another carrier. After a very lengthy process online, our new sim cards came in one day, and following the directions, we tried to activate our phones online. Several frustrating hours later, we were told we needed to go to the Sprint store in Capitola to activate the phones.
Amanda, George, and Trey worked with us for two hours to make the online deal work. We were on the phone with customer care for over an hour, and without the staff's careful help and guidance, nothing would have worked. They really advocated for us every step of the way, shared our frustration, and kept both their patience and their humor. Five huge stars for all three, and we'll keep our fingers crossed about our experience with Sprint as we begin our free year.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< user_id>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Terrible!

We came in an hour before closing to look at upgrade options. I was told we’d receive a $15 credit on my Hulu bill, and that was the same cost for new phones, great! This was the manager that assured me. He then had us work with Tre....

Tre was unprofessional to say the least. He complained about his hourly pay to us and joked about how he wasn’t going to do anything the manager just asked him to do. He wasn’t paying attention to what he was doing, and when I logged into my new phone he said I was logging into too many accounts so we had to set mine up the old school way.

An hour after they closed my phone still wasn’t ready. He told me to come back at 10 Am the next day and that I couldn’t take the new or old phone with me! I took my old phone.

After we get home we realize, while my fiancé has his Apple ID on his new phone, he has my phone number! Tre put my number into his phone and created the 2 hour delay that day.

The next day, show up at 10:15. A trainee is there and he says my new phone is ready. We explain the mix up, and he doesn’t have authorizations and we need to wait for Tre who should be there in 10 minutes. Tre doesn’t show up until 11:20! No wonder you get paid what you do! He literally shrugged sorry to me when I asked what happened to 10AM and then said maybe two words after. I asked for a managers card and I got the stores number.... helpful. You were just in there joking about your email accounts, so I know he has an email. If you haven’t been fired yet it’s only a matter of time.

Two weeks later I get the text to add Hulu. We have the Unlimited Package with Hulu which I told the Sprint Manager, and that’s apparently not eligible for the discount. So the entire reason I went through all this BS is because I was told my budget wouldn’t change; you got me and the sale. Great job!

I prefer not to deal with any Sprint store because I’ve never had a positive experience ever, but Sprint won’t allow me to upgrade online. When I mentioned this to the manager, he jokingly said “you should come in here anyways just see us!” Never again, you guys suck! And this is exactly why I didn’t want to come in; told you so.</review>< Pictures>

<review>Horrible. Terrible service. Tired to up sell me on everything, even though I was eligible for a free phone and my current phone had insurance. He never mentioned I could have gotten a free fix... found that out online after I left. He was extremely annoyed that he didn't make a commission on me.

The staff are not friendly especially the manager. We went to another location and the staff seem to cater to only their fellow Hispanics. We signed in yet people that just got there who did not sign in but were Hispanics were seen first. Not a good place.</Text>

<Review>So lazy all they care about is selling if any other issue they just say go to a corporate store. I worked for sprint for a long time 3rd party and you can do everything. There was a young mexica. Guy that was tryinv to help but this mixed girl was just sitting there say no you can't do that. Just complete laziness don't waste your time coming here!!!< /Review></record>

The store has new staff, service has diminished. It's a 3rd party retailer. It's service center has left, basically you just buy phones and accessories. The true problem is still with a Sprint company itself and the lack of quality cell service in Santa Cruz County.<//review>

I moved here a month ago, and this is a wonderful place to call home! These are nice apartments in a great area. The entire front office staff (Cheryl, Maria & Shanna) were incredibly accommodating and welcoming. The grounds and facilities are kept clean every day by friendly, courteous maintenance staff (Frank, Bryan). I plan to update this review in six months.< /review>

*update:

estancia reached out to me once and left a message. I was unavailable. I called back and the person I needed to speak to wasn’t in the office. I left a voicemail shortly after, still have yet to hear back. Yet again my message hasn’t been returned, and it’s been over 2 weeks. I also called after that during normal business hours and didn’t get an answer.
Unfortunately, I am busy and can’t keep chasing down staff. Is there any way I can email someone about this?

side note: kids keep ding dong ditching people’s apartments. it’s unsafe especially during a pandemic

Been here a long time. office staff NEVER picks up their phone- ever. I have left multiple messages because one of the gates hit my car and left damage and have yet to hear back. On top of this last night part of our apartment was flooded because the water line to our washer broke. I called maintenance emergency after hours and left 3 messages and still have YET to hear back. It left damage behind the washer on top of it being flooded under our appliances. Our baseboards are literally coming off because of the water that flooded last night. Just wish they’d take care of their residents better.</text>

I have been living here with my family for a year now. The apartment is laid out well, and has a large kitchen and gorgeous quartz countertops. The bedrooms are on opposite sides of each other, and the master features a large closet with built in shelves- perfect for all my shoes! The washer and dryer is in-unit, the appliances are stainless steel, and the cozy living room has a cute little gas fireplace. Our patio is nice sized, and we get lots of hummingbirds.

Maria in the front office is super helpful, kind, and a true asset. She responds in a timely manner to any phone calls or emails, and cares about the residents. She helped me locate some missing packages during the holidays, and makes sure that my maintenance concerns are addressed in a timely manner. She is a Gem and one of a kind!

The reason for 4 stars instead of 5, is because not everyone is as helpful as Maria. I had let the office know for months that a sprinkler was broken all summer, which was causing flooding. It was not addressed timely, and I had to get corporate involved. The community water bill is divided between residents, and it was attracting mosquitoes. It also made it difficult to walk my dog when the grass was constantly over watered. There are homeless that live behind the ravine, which our family has personally called the police on multiple times. They are known to jump in the pool during the hot months, and have broken into a car, as well as the soda machine and mail boxes. I hope that a wall can be built, just as the homes on the opposite side of the ravine have- for safety.

Otherwise, there are lots of kids for my son to play with, a nice sized pool, a decent gym, and overall a nice place to live.<//Text>

Maria is awesome. Some of my mail had the address cut off- she recognized my name and called me to come get it. She could have just just sent it back to the post office, but she went above and beyond. Thanks Maria!< /Review>

I recently went with my friend to find a new home for her and she ended up moving into these beautiful apartments. Such a quiet place to live, I stayed the night and the next day walking around we came across the friendliest maintenance guy frank. He was genuine and caring when he asked how my new friends home was. Thanks estancia for having a great staff.<//text>

I just recently toured Estancia with Dayna, looking for a 2 bedroom and I am very pleased. The community is so nice and the amenities are just what I am looking for. The staff was so nice and friendly, everyone has smiles on their faces and are more than welcoming. Dayna was so helpful in answering all of my questions, I can't wait to come back to sign a lease when my current lease is up!<//text>

I have been living here with my husband for 8 months and I am liking it. It's a big complex but I am happy because I feel safe. Sometimes neighbors can be loud but that is something that happens in every apartment complex. There are 2 grocery stores located very close (Stater Bros and Sprouts) which is very convenient. Covid 19 hasn't allowed us to fully enjoy all the amenities that we have been paying for which is why I am giving 4 stars. Overall happy to live here!<//Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>First of all, by writing this review, I would like to express my gratitude to all the personal in charge "Management Team, Leasing Consultants and Maintenance Staff" of the Estancia Apartment Homes for the great experience and beautiful time that my family and I have had for the last 4 years of our lives living in this beautiful place.
Five stars are not enough to show how happy we are with Estancia, specifically in regards to “Dayna” (Leasing Consultant) who’s very knowledgeable about her work and has been very patient and effective in solving and answering any questions we may have had in a timely manner.
We originally were interested in Estancia because of the location (one of the best areas to live in Riverside) but that is not why we ultimately chose to live here, the staff made us feel at home since the very first time we meet them.
Shanna (Manager) is very kind and has always been a great help, she takes her job very seriously and professionally making sure all areas are clean, safe and well maintained and always strives to make the best improvements possible.
We recently had an issue with the refrigerator and the microwave and when I was on my way to the office to make the report I saw “Frankie” (Maintenance Associate), as soon as I told him about the issues with the appliances he called the office right away and quickly came to check and understood the problem. He got me on his list of priorities and within couple of days got replaced with a new microwave and fixed the refrigerator. Thanks Frankie for his sense of urgency and quickly helping us solving the issue.
If you are looking for a place to call home that will treat you like family, look no further! Estancia Apartment Complex is calling! Also don't forget to ask for Dayna!!!< /Text>< Date>

<Review>I visited the property with a friend who was looking for a place to live. We felt very safe, Management had Co-Vid 19 policies in place. But, it was hard to see the Manager's smiling faces through their masks. They were very helpful, professional, in answering all our questions and concerns. We toured the property, plenty of parking, BBQs, Gym, Pool was clear and inviting. The Apartment complex was just what my friend was looking for. I will be coming back to visit and when my lease is up will be moving in here as well.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I have resided here for nearly ten years and can wholeheartedly express that this location has gone above and beyond to meet my expectations. I believe this in part has to do with the staff that helps manage this location, in particular Shawna, the acting supervisor at the moment. The staff, Sheryl and Daniel, has ensured that any concerns that I might have, either with my direct unit or surrounding area, are always a top priority. Instances when I did have questions or comments, the staff was always there to ensure my needs were met, in a fast and effective manner. There are not enough words to truly encompass the amount of work this staff has gone to ensure that all my concerns have been met. The maintenance is another cog in this well-oiled machine that I feel needs to be recognized as they work extremely closely to the staff and ensure that all maintenance problems are resolved whenever one may arise in my unit. I have chosen to make my home at this location for the past ten years, not only because our safety is a top priority and the amenities are constantly being updated, but because of the customer service the staff has provided. I do not feel I could gain this level of customer service for a different location; therefore, I choose to stay with Estancia.<//text><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1597108284201<//Time><user_id>111789515889235602687<//user_id><Gmap_id>0x80dca57038e3304b:0xd73a1f51823a59e1< /Gmap_id><name>MP AH<//name></record>

I’ll be moving in in a week and the process has been timely and enjoyable thanks to Maria Lewis. As soon as I applied online, she reached out to me within the same day. All the necessary tasks needed, she took care of quickly. The apartment itself is very nice and clean, so I can’t wait to move in!< /Text>

<Text>Had a great experience moving into an apartment here recently! Dayna was very helpful and answered my many questions day after day without getting impatient. So far the community is super nice and calm, the maintenance team is very helpful and responds to simple requests in a timely manner, and the apartments themselves are very nice.

7 month update: It's very difficult to get in touch with the leasing office, and even when you're a resident they don't give you an email address to reach them at. I don't usually have issues I need them to resolve, but they're tough to get a hold of when something does come up.</Text>< pics>

Frank has done nothing but an outstanding job for me since I moved into this complex three years ago. He always is so courteous and professional. The best part is he is very reliable. The last time I needed his help was when my air conditioning went out. It turned out we need a whole new unit and the management was dragging their feet getting having a new one put in approved. But Frank kept on them the entire time and even provided us with portable air conditioning units while we waited.  He kept in constant contact with us all the way through to the end and even after checks in to make sure everything is still working. Thank you Frank for all your help!</Text>

WOW. what can I say about Frank. Frank has done nothing but an outstanding job for me. He always is so courteous and professional. The best part is very reliable. I usually request Frank to come look at the maintenance request. One he shows up in a very timely manner. secondly he explains whats he going to do and thirdly when he is the building i hardly notice him. But once work is completed he goes over on the repairs he made and how to prevent them. Thank you Frank</review>

I moved into these apartments a year ago and I have to say that it has been a pleasure to live here. From the start of my move in, Cheryl was fantastic, and to the tiny maintenance issues that I have had, Frank has been exceptional. I can honestly say I have no real complaints right now. My neighbors for the most part are great, my kids love it here, and the staff keeps things running well! Thank you all, and thank you Frank for putting up with those small issues when I first moved in! :)<//review>

Apartment employees are great. Especially I would say their Maintenace is out of the ordinary. I believe the gentleman usually help us is Frank. He might me Maintenace manager or something but I am not quite sure. I remember during the summer time AC gave up. Usual apartments has work orders which has long wait. But frank took care of it within and hour. He also was very helpful when we moved in. Great Maintenace program or personal is certainly a great asset for an apartment.

They will tell you one thing and do another. They don't call you back and things always get misplaced/lost. (Including my 30day notice) luckily I had a copy.. The fire alarms always malfunction and go off for no reason. In addition to that.. I was moved out on the 17th because I was told my lease was up on the 19th then was told not to worry that I would not be charged extra just the rent amout. Then I was charged extra. I ended up having to pay about 1k at move out when is was all said and done when I tried calling about it no one called me back. So happy I moved. 🤗<//Review>

I have lived here for a number of years. While it has never been great the location is good and they allow pets. Ever since the new owner took over the prices have escalated and the overall property has declined. Sure they painted the buildings and gardeners come twice a week but that does not make up for trash everywhere (especially in the gully by the dumpster) and dog poop that does not get picked up, perhaps because the poop bags rarely get replaced. Children play on the lawn and I can't imagine what they step in as they race around. Speaking of children there is a shallow pool here that, I am sure, exceeds capacity daily and becomes a giant toilet at the end of the day. The staff is okay but totally ineffective. My lease is up soon and I will happily move on but I feel bad for the residents left here.<//review>

Manager didn't assign a parking space, but told us our apartment included a garage. About two or three months into our lease, they started charging us extra for the garage.

These guys are not honest. We left after one year and they came up with all kinds of fake cleaning fees. I didn't fight it because I was making a home purchase and didn't want the headache over $350. Bottom line, nice apartments, but bad management, bad customer service, look elsewhere!<//review>< rate>

ITS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE....Parents let their brats run WILD screaming & yelling, UNSUPERVISED! Management is to lazy to get off their asses & do something about it!  Its a very FILTHY place to live. ...they charge you for "valet trash" but yet the dumpsters are overflowing and trash everywhere! Not to mention the break ins, and the thefts that have taken place around here, Mgmt wont tell you that, but ask us and some of our neighbors, we will tell you the TRUTH...Also You are lucky if you get your mail ! On a training route so different mail people everyday! The Mailboxes have been broken into multiple times, as well as vehicles. They have had TVs out by the pool that have been stolen. Speaking of the pool area, if you are a adult paying rent here & think you will get to enjoy a few hours of R & R by the pool, or enjoy the jacuzzi, think again! forget it, it will NEVER happen here!...Kids RUNNING AROUND THE POOL, SCREAMING & JUMPING IN, even climbing the gate to get in! Mgmt sits in their office not doing a thing about it!   Gas has been stolen from cars in our parking stalls! The owners are to stupid to put cameras up!
Parents are NOT Parenting THEIR kids, (cant wait til those brats grow up & tell their parents to  F.O.  cause thats what they will do without any discipline! SLAMMING DOORS, Running thru SCREAMING & YELLING!
Let those parents reap what they sow!
Upstairs people have no common sense or common courtesy either STOMPING and slamming drawers, etc. Its absolutely the WORST place I've ever lived!
Let the Greedy Owners with their pathetic Mgmt here reap what they sow as well...KARMA is coming !<//text>

<Text>Two stars for the located only . It's pricey and it's dirty ! I don't get how you cant have staff when charging 1500-1800 for an apartment . Plus the pool is a mess ! There's kids running around everywhere, they go into the gym to mess things up and the staff doesn't do anything .the  Pool forget trying to relax you have a bunch of people that don't even live here drinking ,smoking ,  cussing up a storm . The manager doesn't do anything and they don't care . They told me well you need to call the police ! Excuse me I pay this place 1600!!!

< Review>
Maria and Frank were very helpful with my move in, and with an issue with packages being sent to a previous tenant. I plan to update this review after 3 months.

Update: So far so good, maintenance requests have been promptly taken care of, office staff (previous/current) have been helpful.</Review>

Came with a group of six and our server was attentive and helpful. The atmosphere is casual and they have a TV (low volume off to the side of the room) that they were willing to adjust channels for us. The quality of the fish was good and tasted fresh. Their rice is seasoned nicely so that it complimented the fish on top which I enjoyed. Presentation was pleasing and clean. I would recommend this for a casual sushi night out or with groups - they took us without a reservation with no hesitation.<//review>

<text>The service here is always great.  The sushi chefs are kind and often fix up complimentary appetizers, which is a nice touch.  The sushi rolls are pretty good and the prices are very reasonable.  The atmosphere isn't the best but its a comfortable place to get some sushi.  Our go to place for a quick good sushi dinner.<//text>< Name>

I used to love this place but it's not as good any more.  My Sashimi Salad had plenty of fresh fish but it had chili oil on it, and very little salad greens, no rice at all.  My favorite Salmon Skin Asparagus Salad was different too, soggy and cut into smaller pieces.  My roll was wierd, a nice piece of salmon wrapped around some too-spicy puree of something.  Time to choose a new favorite sushi joint.  Everything here tastes the same, the food has lost its character.<//Review>

Sumo is always consistent and fresh. If you have a friend with similar tastes definitely take a look at the boat option on the menu. Staff is great and they can always fit in a big party on short notice for me.< /text>

Do not go here for the Sushi I have tried Spicy Salmon Roll, Tuna Avocado Roll while the fish is fresh the Sushi is poorly executed in terms of flavor profile and cut of fish.

Go here for the Lunch Special! One word Sesame Chicken, get this and you will guaranteed be back, and get some extra sesame sauce. All of their cooked food is really good, so maybe if you get a cooked roll it might be good but I have not tried them.<//review>

Came here with friends. The atmosphere is, well, lacking. We sat down and they had "Wild 106" - a local radio station - on (loud) for music and the station was on a commercial break. Seriously? It felt like we were at a Carls Jr.

We walked out. Sumo Sushi, PLEASE pay a few bucks a month and use Spotify or Apple Music.</Text>

<Text>7pm Friday night.  Tables not completely full, nobody waiting for a table.  My family of four doesn't even get acknowledged when we enter.  After 10 minutes of standing there and having the staff walk by we left.   Not a single person was the least bit apologetic about customers walking out.  Apparently the last customer was complaining about the slow service so maybe it was lucky we were ignored.  Wish I can put 0 stars.</Text>< Date>

Probably one of the better sushi restaurants in SLO. Great, prompt service and fresh food. Sushi can be sketchy, but Sumo has a very consistent quality. They don't have cheap splintery chopsticks either, but higher quality bamboo ones. I'm always impressepd with Sumo. Wonderful!< /Text>

<review>Sometimes Sumo is a 3 star experience... Sometimes it's a 5. I'm not sure what accounts for the inconsistency, but it's a little strange.

The first three times I went, it was extremely good, and for a very reasonable price. The rolls were simple, but very well made and very robust. The spicy tuna in particular was excellent, with a bright red color that showed freshness and ample use of spices. The sashimi was mouthwatering and perfectly cut. Even the miso soup at Sumo is particularly great. My brother and I got out of Sumo for under $40 at dinner, and to put it mildly, we ate a ridiculous amount of high quality fish and appetizers.

But then I've been there twice where the experience was different. Despite the place being nearly empty, our server took about 10 minutes just to get us menus for some reason (not typical), and we got one water refill after we had already finished our meal (kind of pointless). I ordered the same spicy tuna roll, and it was completely different from my previous visits... It was a pale orange color, and was mostly rice. Not great. The California roll was also overburdened with rice and the surimi and Crab mix was grossly filled with a ton of mayo.

The price during lunch on a Wednesday was also somehow more than it was during dinner on a Saturday, even though the visits were just a few weeks apart. The staff wasn't as friendly either, and never asked us hoe our food was.

It's strange that the experiences were so totally different in a span of just a few weeks... But they were. I love Sumo, and have some great memories there with friends and family. I just wish they were more consistent.

Tips:
Sit at the bar. You get a lot more service there, and the chefs will even talk to you about your food. It's a nice experience.

Wednesdays offer extremely affordable saki bombs. If that's what you're into, I doubt there's a better deal anywhere else.

The spicy tuna roll is pretty cheap and is (usually) extremely good. It's the best I've had anywhere when it's done right.< /review>< response>

Got my Civic Exhaust manifold (already removed from the car) welded in less than 5 mins. The person helped was very attentive and helpful.

Very reason charge for the job and was the same amount the quoted over the phone.

Will be my go-to shop or any future automotive welding jobs<//text>

<Date>1564607320824< /Date><Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Wow I would definitely have to say one of the best Express muffler places in town. I brought in a late model Mercedes Benz Sudan, as well as a early model BMW. He did a tremendous job on a BMW. So a year-and-a-half later, I decided to bring a late model Mercedes Benz and have that exhaust updated. And again Great Job! When they say Express they really mean it. 2hr or less! YES.
Now don't let Mercedes-Benz and BMW confuse you most people bringing cars in there aren't bringing in those type of vehicles. To be honest every time I've been there I see Hondas, Nissans, Toyotas, that includes Scion, Volkswagens, Cadillac Escalade, ext. This place has great prices, I haven't found anyone to beat them.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrO8e2Whr1QyfVcqyV0u6mhx7pQ07KEspF42ne=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM6E_UCUiwb8omr_FCpIY3WONiWNEtzCYg7vbsg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3wTZH0roZmjRXDQ6NYdbnq3Zt7Tfe9eHZfBov=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x808fcc65172ef38f:0x64c3a99989a03f52< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Cheap if limited in this capabilities. I once took a catalytic converter I bought from Amazon and took it to them to get welded on my car, they did it for $60 without any fuss at all. More recently I went to them to fix a header leak, they decided not to take on the job fearing they would break the studs and end up taking the cylinder head off.</Review></record>

Worst customer service...EVER..Can't believe they are still open.  All I wanted was to purchase a couple pieces of tubing about 2 feet long and have a couple bends put in them. Was willing to pay what ever he was going to charge me. He told me I had to bring the car in and they don't sell parts. Went to Babe's Mufflers on The Alameda. They didn't even hesitate,  10 minutes and I was out of there with better than I came in for.< /review>

Great pricing for muffler installation, plus they installed my new muffler the way I wanted it done. Although their business front is not the best by any means, I would recommend this shop for those with exhaust needs.</review>

Have only met one employee who works in the evenings but she has been soooo awesome both over the phone and in person. The first time my partner and I went in person, we forgot what we went in for (so silly) and after the helper got us talking, she recognized my partner's voice (from a previous phone call) and pointed us to the stuff we were looking for (what a life saver!!!!).< /Text>

Thank you so much! I greatly love the service that I received from the staff working in this shop. He was very accommodating, nice, and helpful. Honestly, he was the one to help me find the best pet, and I loved it. Their shop was clean, comfortable, and pets were well-arranged. Eventually, I came to realize that I will come back from time to time here. Again, thank you for the service!</Text>

My beloved Doberman died almost 13 years old and my heart is broken losing my best friend. I'm getting a Dobie pup and the awesome girl working there was so nice and helpful.she gave me some samples for food. Great place to go. They aren't a huge store but they have the most and best things for all animals and birds. I like buying there.< /review>

Best customer service each time I go. The girls who rotate the registers are sweet and knowledgeable as can be. I've never once left buying a product from them I feel unsure about. they have cat adoptions on the weekends and low cast vaccine clinics so it's a really versatile place for all pet needs. I've been going for the last five years and live nearby. If I didn't live in Burbank, I'd still go to these folks. 100% recommend!!</Text>

<Review>People of Burbank and surrounding cities, support your local small business establishments. Great place to buy pet products for fido. And for goodness sake, don't pet the talking parrot...i mean really, the sign says "I bite" and people still stick their hands in the cage. I wonder if this is part of Charles Darwin theory that the dumb will not live long...but seriously, support your local business< /Review><Response>None<//Response><rate>5< /rate>< user>

< Review>
Really great selection of products, especially for dogs. I've been going to Centinelas for a while and just walked into this store out of curiosity and was surprised at how competitive the tiny store was to the much bigger Centinelas. They have always had a cheery attendant at the register and I really like the small and local vibe.</Review>

The people that work here are very nice and helpful. As much as I prefer shopping at smaller local stores, this place's selection is kind of lacking.</Text>

<Review>The food was not that great. The BBQ Pork was mostly fat, and I bit into a bone and almost broke my tooth. The Kung Pao was ok, the veggies were not cooked at all, the chicken and the total flavor was good.
Mushroom Chicken was ok. Again the veggies were way undercooked.

The only thing that was pretty good was the Coconut Shrimp and Chow Mein.
The shrimp had a great flavor and was still a little crunchy. But I guess that was because it was just made and brought out when we were ordering.

The Chow Mein was the winner of this combo plate. It was so goood!

This is just my opinion,  you might like it if you like fast food Chinese food.
I give it a 5/10.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Happened upon here Christmas Eve, and have been back a few times since. Good food, at a reasonable price. And they give you very large helpings. We love the spicy fish, and coconut shrimp. Noodles aren't greasy either. We ate in the last time... restaurant was very clean and bright. Only gripe had been the cheese wontons...the same as all other restaurants. On the east coast, they mix crab with the cream cheese for the filling... haven't found them anywhere out here. The addition of crab rangoons, on the menu, would automatically make this restaurant my favorite one. 🖤</Review>

I liked the coconut shrimp. The bbq pork was awful. Very fatty. Seems like more fat than meat. The rice smelled like fish & tasted like it too. The chow mein was pretty much spaghetti noodles with very little flavor & almost no vegetables. Never again for us. It had been recommended highly. Only the prices are good. We'll stick with Panda Express.</Review>

Not good at all.  Got Mongolian beef and there was WAAAAAY too much onions and like literally 5 pieces of beef. Got a full cup of onions on top covering all the meat. I love onions so I looked past it, but the beef was gross as well. It was super sweet and warm at best.  Ugh.

Food was fresh and ready. Portions for a 3 choice meal was enough for two people!  Got the string bean chicken, mushroom chicken, and coconut shrimp along with a drink. Two adults ate for under $12! Good price and good fast Chinese food.< /Review>

<Text>I came on a Sunday at noon. The food was some of the freshest I've seen at any of these fast food chinese places. Portion sizes were huge - at least 35% more food than what you'd get at Panda Express. Tasty, clean, good value!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

I've read some of the reviews, to JESSICA RAYA, what a harsh thing to say,  maybe you were having a bad day that day,  I been eating there for years,  NEVER HAD A PROBLEM,  they give you plenty of good tasting foods,  fresh,  and tasty,  my favorite,  CHICKEN WINGS. Me  My wife and daughter travel far but its worth it to go.</Review>

The restaurant was neat and clean, as it usually is. Their jalapeno chicken is a little different from all the others. I highly recommend it. And the sweet coconut shrimp. Your taste buds will thank you.< /review>

My parents thought they'd celebrate their anniversary at home last night (4/15/18) with dinner and a movie. They decided to get Ho Ho Chinese Food for dinner - cheap, simple, good, you know? Well after they got home and had their dinner, they weren't feeling too good. Come to find out this morning, they were hit with food poisoning. Happy Anniversary, right? We'll definitely be staying away from this place.<//text>

Great location for delicious Chinese food. Arrived at five, it wasn't busy. I'll return with my friends. Prices are decent for the quality.< /text>

Just about the worst, most cheaply made highly salty Chinese food you can find. I made the mistake of trying this place out I can't figure out one of my crazy friend Dre recommended it, unless he had a stroke and lost his sense of taste and hasn't told me about it!<//Text>

<Review>My husband and I ordered our food from this restaurant through door dash. Our food was cold, my teriyaki chicken had no sauce, and we weren’t given chow mein, and for the cherry on top, we found hair in the rice!  DoorDash gave us a refund. We called the restaurant to tell them to check the rice because our food had hair. We also complained about the other instances and instead of an apology, the manager says “Next time, come in to order the food and it be hot”
Me: “so you’re telling me that if we come in and order ourselves, that there will be no hair in our food? Us ordering delivery is what put the hair there???”
Manager: “yes, yes, come in next time”
I am so glad I wasn’t there in person for this conversation....... and my husband??? He has been vomiting for a while. This place needs to be shut down.<//Review>< pics>

<review>**AVOID IF YOU DONT WANT TO BE SICK**

I’ve been going to this location since my family moved to riverside. Always been great experience but since new ownership the restaurant took a 180 turn. I never learn my lesson and keep going back and every time it’s the same I get sick. Yesterday my father and little bro and his friend took home food from there and now my little brother is at kaiser with food poisoning violently throwing up and his friend sick at home as well. These people either don’t know how to properly cook, don’t store food correctly or don’t wash their hands after using the restroom but I WILL NEVER EVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80dcb056eeda5f49:0x74384cc4cc512da3</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<review>Its a great place if you're looking for nice size portions, however if you're looking for traditional cuisine its more Americanized. There's plenty of parking and the staff are quick and friendly</review>< userid>

The chow mein has no flavor at all and it tasted too soggy not to mention that all of the sauces that they put on there food like teriyaki sauce is so watered down it looks like liquid when they pour onto your food it's disgusting the teriyaki sauce is not even thick like it is supposed to be. It's so watered down it makes your food soggy. Not to mention the food gave my husband and I a stomach ache.<//Text>

The food was bland and the portions were pretty small compared to other places in the area. The fried was was just greasy rice without any veggies or egg. The amount of lo mein I received was laughable, so I purchased an extra small portion side of lo mein.. 1.99 for a box of lo mein that was like the size of two fortune cookies! My friend wanted a vegetarian option. No tofu was allowed for the standard one or two item plates.<//text>

<Review>We went to this place tonight on the advise of a trusted friend. I have never been somewhere where people are soooo incredibly rude to you and your children. The food was awful and tasteless. Teriyaki Chicken was dry, Orange Chicken was tasteless, Fried Rice wasn't fried and was insanely dry... and chow mein was nasty. They have a sign that says "Refill one only" - which in our mind meant that they offer 1 refill. WRONG... and Misleading! They charge you for everything... even for an extra to go box. Don't go here... if you are expecting Panda Express or Pick Up Stix, DO NOT GO HERE! VERY RUDE OWNERS... AND VERY BAD QUALITY!  AND THEN THEY STAND BEHIND THE COUNTER AND TALK RUDELY ABOUT YOUR FAMILY IF YOU ARE EATING THERE!<//Review>< username>

The name of the Guy is ( Martin ) He is so polite and so nice you will not expect it! Everything seems so good. I told him I had to go talk to my mom about the storage space. He said it was going to be $54 a month for a 8 x 5 storage space. I was walking out with my daughter and he said to me before you go I’ll give you a special $29 this month and $30 every month from now on but you have to get it now. I said well I need to go talk to my mom are you gonna be here tomorrow he said no I’m not gonna be here the whole week. So I went Looking for my mom but she was sleeping. So from $54-$29 I thought it was a good deal so I went back without my mom’s confirmation and told the guy I was going to do the deal. He started doing paperwork ask me for my debit card swiped it for  $44.12 sadly at that point I didn’t see the amount he charged me. So he first charge my debit card and then gave me the form and said sign here while I was reading the form I told him why is it saying $44.12 he said just sign that one and I’ll explain everything right now . He said don’t tell anybody that I’m giving you this deal. So by then I already had signed the form I was trusting him. Then once he seen I had already sing the form he tells me it’s going to be $39 a month and if you’re late one time it’s going to go back up to $54 a month he started being super straight up and not the person I was dealing with at the beginning my daughter was there to prove that I am not lying I felt so mad that this guy had played me so hard. I looked into his eyes and I told him you lied to me you made me sign and charge my card and you lied in my face he kept saying I didn’t lie I never said it was $29 a month he said I said $39! So at the end I was really disappointed because I already had paid and signed that form. I walked out I asked my daughter did you hear when he said 29 to start and $30 a month from now my daughter said he has I heard him I’m so disappointed in this please.< /Text>

Nothing special about the place, just an average self storage place. The only reason I'm giving this two stars is because they upped my rent by almost 15% more with just a two day "heads up"<//text>

All major storage facilities issue increases in order to offset property costs, rent changes from competitors, etc. We looked into your account, and it appears that we transmitted a notice to your address on file on October 24th, so you should have received a letter via first class mail shortly after.

Excellent customer service by Rainey. She was very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.....not the type of customer service you typically get from places like this but I was very pleased with her customer service attitude. I appreciate the quick and informative way she handled my whole storage rental process from beginning to end. Left feeling very satisfied. Thanks Rainey.< /review>

In order to amend or update a lease, the primary tenant does have to be physically present in order to provide written consent for any changes to their account. Unfortunately, since your aunt is hospitalized, there is nothing we can do in this regard.\n\nIt does appear that your relative is authorized for access to your aunt's account, however, we were unable to assist you in the event that you do not have a key to the lock. We were able to provide you with a gate code, and after finding your key, you were indeed granted access our property and your aunt's storage unit.\n\nUpon further review of this complaint, it was revealed that an incident report was filed against your relative on New Year's Eve. Apparently, after our Property Manager, Rainie, had kindly warned your party of an early property closure due to the holiday, your relative had nearly gotten into an unprovoked physical altercation with her. This lead to the police being called to the property and was a clear violation of our rules and regulations. As mentioned earlier, security is of utmost importance. This kind of conduct is not tolerated and we reserve the right to revoke access to any tenant or guest. If you are capable of behaving within the provisions of our rules and regulations, then you are more than welcome onto our property.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nManagement"}<//resp><userid>102895404660301117651</userid>< rate>

<text>I have read so many reviews here stating what great customer service they have , not true in my case, it was terrible, especially from a ms. Rainey. After posting a past due payment for my aunt that wound up in the hospital from a heartattack, we were not given access to my aunts unit so that we may remove her belongings before the next months payment. Ms. Rainey never updated the notes on the account to allow us access. She was all to happy to take our money but did little else to make this an easier process. She even had the nerve to suggest that we go to the hospital and take a selfie with my aunt giving a thumbs up. They also asked to speak to her,  even tho we told them she could not because she has a trache in her throat. After having the woman at the counter get ms. Rainey on the phone, she said she would not change anything on the account, and that we need to come back tomorrow and when she is in the office. After explaining that my mother was made executive to my aunts estate when she was admitted to the hospital the woman at the counter said she would talk to their lawyers and see what they have to say. Well after waiting in the parking lot for 20 minutes with an angry mother the woman at the counter came out and said they would give us access if we had a key to the unit which we did. Overall a terrible experience , the woman at the counter was helpful but ms. Rainey needs to work on her customer service.
P.S. , I don't know what they have going on at this facility but there seems to be a lot of people hanging out at the facility. I mean they weren't loading or unloading anything, they seem to loiter and do repairs to cars in the middle of the aisles. I even witnessed one of these people bring in 2 cartons of eggnog and asked that the woman at the counter store it for him in the refrigerator, then go into the bathroom with two other people, I'm  going to take a wild guess and suggest they are homeless and probably live in their unit, and it seems to be permitted by this facility. I will be calling corporate and filing a complaint .<//text>< user_name>

<Review>UPDATE!!!
One negative is access closes too early on Sunday’s and holidays...Customer Service is not the issue, that is good.....BUT,  after being their Customer since 2017, I'll be ending the relationship by the end of month. One of the two reasons is the excessive price increases since then. $30 dollar increase in less than 3 years. You'd think after leasing a year or two, you would get a break...NO... they break you all right....BEWARE....DO not be late. I've been late 2 times and the most recent late fee was $55.00. They added a $20 lock out fee(paid on 29th,) but I called a week ahead and said I'd be late on a $203.00 monthly rent (I forgot about them adding fee, they didn't mention)mind you, in almost 36 months I was late 2 times...that's it....they will do one courtesy wave.but they increased their late fee...I also rent another 10x20 from Store America in SB. They do not charge the excessive fee that this Arlington location does. Plus I get Military discount at the Berdoo one, not at the Arlington one...Now, they should have free donuts on Mondays like the one in NorthBerdoo!

I'm very pleased with the customer service, Ranie is very professional and knowledgeable. I've been here for a few months now and the times I've come into the office to make a payment she has been friendly and takes the time to remember everyone's names and she brings positive energey, I recomemed this facility for its cleanliness and friendly staff, i feel i can trust my belongings here as well.The move in process is quick and painless, she is very throrough and explains everything in great detail. She is the perfect person to go to in need of a storage whether you lost your house, going through a divorce, or simply just trying to get your house in order, she always has a smile and works very hard. I hope my review helps you chose a place you are happy with. Not to mention, they have a move in special of $29.99 for the first month.<//Review>

New Life Church has been our home Church for 10 years.  Pastor David is an incredible Pastor that has a true gift from God and all of the staff is so helpful. This church will truly welcome anyone and come as you are. We feel so blessed to be part of the New Life Family</review>

This is my church home! I've been attending for 14+  years. The pastoral staff is annointed by God. The emphasis is on personal growth, community awareness in the 5-Cities and beyond, missions, both domestically and internationally, and most of all, keeping our focus on Jesus Christ, our Lord!</Review>

<Review>My wife and I have visited this church twice since arriving to the five cities area, I knew in my heart that this was going to be our church. I met pastor David, he is an incredible pastor led by the holy sprit. I look forward to meeting more people, becoming a new member, engaging and growning spiritually. If your looking for a spirit filled and god led church where you feel free to express and worship god, this might be the place for you.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80ec5eda809f9551:0x9a4f40cbba8d99ad< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Michelle was really helpful. Found everything I wanted. And I got a 10 percent discount!
The delivery driver was very nice, too. Found my house was no problems. I'll definitely use you again.<//Review>

I love this delivery service. It is my favorite in town. Not only for canna products, but like just in general. My last delivery person was April. Who did a urgent job, but I do an order from them every couple weeks and every driver I've had has been amazing. Door Dash & Amazon Fresh should look into this level of quality.<//Text>

I order about once every 3 weeks and they are ALWAYS amazing 👏 Their communication is awesome and they are always so professional  and so courteous. One time I had ordered the wrong item and they were great about coming back to exchange it.  The driver did not even want to accept my 2nd tip but I insisted because it was it was MY error and I am out in Lincoln! I strongly recommend them.< /Review>

Michelle was very helpful as far as product info and helped me to decide about which product to choose.
I got Space Monkey Space Cakes and my favorite Bird Valley FSO!
To speak on the delivery service, talk about FAST! By the time I hung up with completing my order, the driver Erin text me about ETA. Erin was at my house within 30 minutes or less.
She was very bubbly and nice. Very accurate with change and took her time.
Thanks ladies!</Text>

Excellent delivery service and Keaton and Marcus are always punctual. Flower has always been excellent and they are one of the few who carry smokiez edibles which are one of the few that actually work it seems. They also have a Veteran discount for you fellow veterans<//Review>

The message mentions the team member Hayley, I’m not sure if that’s the person I was initially texting but she was very helpful and thorough. I was able to get the Raw Garden concentrate BOGO $1 :) Jasmine my delivery driver was also quick to arrive and very nice.</Review>

<Review>I've been with Sac Confidential since they first opened and years later I'm still with them. I can order from them and I never have buyers remorse like I did the few other times I've tried other delivery services. They actually have the best prices and you can never go wrong with any of the Space Monkey products. I also think the people that work there from the drivers to the phone operators are very friendly and personable plus they always make me feel  welcomed and appreciated. I couldn't imagine ordering from any other place.< /Review><Date>1605064894528< /Date><rate>5<//rate><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Sacramento Confidential is my go-to cannabis delivery service. I live in Sacramento, and their drivers always bring our edibles and premium flower to our door expediently and courteously. Highly recommended if you are looking for a marijuana delivery service.<//Review>

{'time': 1593565412104, 'text': 'Riley Riot,\nWhen was it that you did the purchase? We do not even show a Riley in our history. If you would call back and ask for a manager (916)520-4512, they are always available to resolve any issues. As far as the cart dates, we are within the laws of expiration and we sell only non expired products and sell accordingly when it comes to dates and rotation. And do not stray from that otherwise we would end up with expired products. Three months ample time for consumption prior to the expiration that you had stated. Wish my milk would last that long after I buy it but it is not the case.  Thank you for taking the time to post the review and bringing some of this to light. If you could reach out to management on the details of when and what time you had the issue so we can speak with our staff member and correct this from being an issue in the future.\nStay Lifted,\nSCD'}< /Response>

This is the easiest time I have had with orders being delivered. The order is processed quickly, and communication with the store is easy and positive.

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Worst service I’ve ever had there. Employees kids running and screaming around customers trying to enjoy there food. The Server brings food that ends up being wrong and never comes back to even refill drinks. We had to get up and go to front counter and ask for a refill. You have lost our Business. We usually really enjoy it there but with everything that happened not happy. If it would have been one thing you never know. Maybe the owners need to hire a Manager that can manage when there not around. Would have given a zero star but wouldn’t let me go lower than one. Not happy<//review>< pictures>

Ok so we did just that.We sat for about 20 minutes before someone came and took our drink order mind you it was not that busy we finally got our drinks I ordered a strawberry margarita and my wife a iced tea my margarita was the worst drink I have had in years as you can see in the picture.

The chips and salsa
The salsa taste like a can of tomato sauce blended with some Tabasco sauce. The chips were probably bought at Costco not fresh at all..

The food took about 35 minutes to come out. Me and my wife ordered the Same thing chicken taco and a chicken enchilada..the taco was way to dry to eat the beans and rice was probably the best thing on the plate after eating here we definitely will not be going back to eat or to have drinks....<//Text>< rate>

<Review>Owner gets drunk at the bar while his buisness goes in the toilet. Been coming here since I was a kid. Never again.

How do you book a party of 15 at 730 when your kitchen closes at 8 and then tell us at 7:53 that your out of most everything including chips and to hurry up and order. Terrible business.<//Review><Rating>1<//Rating><Time>1617170578307</Time></record>

Main course was good but all 4 of us hated the refried beans.  Too dry and too many whole beans.  Seemed like they plated the dish then heated the beans in the salamander. On the other hand it was nice to be able to go out. Restuarant was very clean and service was excellent!!< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><userid>110094099451968294519</userid><Review>Me and my girlfriend went to taco Tuesday and the first thing we noticed was the chips were cold. In the past I remembered the chips being served warm because they were placed underneath a heat lamp. The salsa was unusually bland with absolutely no spice and my girlfriends margarita had very little to no alcohol with a small amount of salt on the rim. This was a huge disappointment because in the past their margarita's were flavorful with plenty of salt on the rim. At this point we were almost ready to leave, but we decided stay and order our usual hard shelled tacos with shredded beef and chicken. Then its gets worst because it took a long time to receive our order and when the tacos were served they were cold. They also lacked flavor, cheese, tomatoes, and the meat was filled with water, which made the tacos turn soggy. The music was annoying loud and they played a medley of rock, pop, and country with Pandora ads. To conclude, this is our last time dining at Bella Nita's because their staff doesn't take any pride in their food or customer service!!! Goodbye and Good Reddens Bella Nita's!!!< /Review><name>Joseph Zamora< /name>< Gmap_id>

<Text>My boyfriend & I enjoyed going
to  "TACO TUESDAY!"  We loved going there, but today I was very disappointed with my tacos,  my drink,  the music & the service.  The food had no flavor, the chips were cold, the salsa didn't  taste good, food is not  like it used to be. My Margarita had no salt or alcahol, it tasted like pure ice .  The service was not like  the service we were used to.   They were playing loud rock & country music, no Mexican  music was played.   The whole atmosphere has changed I don't think we'll be going back.  Hmmm??  Not sure why they are changing from what La Nita's restaurant  used to be.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

Pretty good but my burrito was dry. Some of the chips were delicious then a few were rancid from old oil or something. Good salsa.</text>

<Text>Love Bella Nita's (formerly LaNita's for decades) carnitas, fajitas, nachos, chips, salsa, and original wine margaritas. Generous servings, great friendly service, lots of tables and booths for groups of all sizes plus a big group room. Just go!<//Text>< time>

Love this restaurant for over 40 years, in three different locations. So sorry to see the closing of a stand out staff and friends.
Best wishes on your new adventures!!! And new opening of a sports bar< /review>

<Text>Party of 4 , EVERY PLATE came out 10 minutes apart. Fish & shrimp tacos-TERRIBLE. Absolutely no shrimp, was fish in tortillas, that couldn't even be chewed, no cheese, no lettuce, NOTHING. Asada fries, AWFUL, meat appeared VERY old, daughter didn't take a bite. Boxed it, our dogs wouldn't eat it. I'd give 0 stars if I could. Worst "dining" experience, ever!</Text>< pics>

Always the best food! My #1 go to for Mexican food.... portions on beans & rice have gotten allot smaller compared to when we first started coming here many many years ago.  Also the change awhile back on the charge for carrots now. I don't agree with but I still get them occasionally. I know they waisted a lot because people didn't eat them. But instead of charging they should have just started asking if people would like the carrots instead. Same thing with chips & salsa just so it doesn't get waisted if it's not wanted. Another suggestion would be to offer one or the other.<//Review>

Love this place! We drive from Dos Palos to eat here. Friendly service, all chips and salsa you can eat! Good portions for cost. Must take home extra chips and salsa.
If you haven't tried it already, you've got to try the Fried Ice Cream! It's yummy!< /Text>

Awesome food and friendly staff. I have been going there for 40 years. My father and his buddy's started going to lunch there in 1964. We have never had a bad meal.<//review>

<review>Reminiscent of the old lanitas, it has great atmosphere and good food. I got a food item called "carnitas dinner" they gave me at least half pound of carnitas with tortillas and a side of rice and beans and it was great. with my soda I believe my total was like 20$ and that's because the dinner was 14 dollars itself but in my opinion worth the money and worth trying</review>< Pics>

<userid>113671261886073025583</userid><Name>Rosa Goodhart</Name><Text>My Husband told the Girl at the register he wanted two Chili verde burrito dinners and she said they had two choices with one or two burritos with rice and beans. He asked if they were big portions and was told yes. So he ordered one burrito in each for $24.00 total. He got home and when I opened them the burrito was the size of the .49 cent frozen burritos you get at a store. I called and asked for a Manager and was told by the lady that answered it was her. I voiced our Concern as I noted and she went on the defensive and said they had one size and according to her she even made them herself and was portioned correctly. I asked for her Boss since evidently she didn't care about my concern and she said that would be her Husband and he owns the Restaurant. So now she goes from Mansger to Owner. If this is how they run their business then I will never go back!< /Text>< Resp>

<text>Maybe this place was good at one point, but it is not good at all. Overpriced very bad quality of food. Cheap nacho cheese taste like it's been sitting in a hot pot all day and the Carne taste like hamburger meat. I won't come here again. Thsee days there's no excuse for such poor food. Even the lady's Chile Verde was overpriced for the quality of the plate.<//text><rating>1</rating>< Response>

<Review>Excellent place to eat. Maybe under staffed at times but its worth the wait. Excellent waitresses and very generous with there chips salsa and carrots. I miss Merced but Atwater just as good because they kept the MMerced waitresses. We dine there regularly and have always been satisfied.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80916b0d41660163:0x81429b93cdaa6c68</Gmap_id>< Resp>

We used to have a lot of spiders and other bugs in our backyard and now I never see them. They also treat our grass for fleas and ticks which is a must if you have animals. The technicians are friendly and easy to deal with. I would highly recommend!< /text></record>

Moxie has possibly the nicest work force next to Disney. We’ve used Moxie for 10+ years and never have had a problem or issue. Always polite, always going a little beyond what is required and the service works. No more spiders or ants in my home. Perfect!<//text>

This review is for an ongoing quarterly pest control service. I really appreciated getting a call and text notice in advance of the visit. Overall, everything was great - customer service, on-site service and follow up to make sure any questions or concerns were addressed. Will continue to use Moxie and highly recommend to anyone else.< /text>

They always are very professional and accommodating when they arrive at your home. If you need them to do more in the backyard all you have to do is explain to them where and if you need more applied.

Been with Moxie almost 1 year and half and is very happy with there service. There customer service is excellent with scheduling or using another time to do the moxie applications.

My most important thought is it is that they are environmentally friendly and also if you have animals they are safe from the items they apply to your home.

Great service and I will recommend to many people...</Review>

I have bait traps for rodents that they check and fill.  They are also spraying for beetles and earwigs.

We have had other companies, but Moxie beats them hands down!  We have dogs, rabbits and birds.  The chemicals they use are safe for our pets.  When a rodent eats the bait, and gets slow, our large male dog catches them for us.  The bait is "2nd Generation" meaning if my dog did eat the rodent, the bait would not harm my dog.  Great Right?!  Moxie has been wonderful and responsive.  I can call anytime I see a pest and I get added to their schedule.  Thanks Moxie!<//text>

<text>Tech arrived on prearranged day.  Everyone was home, gate was locked.  Normal tech would ring bell and we lock up our 2 large dogs then unlock gate.  Tech only did front yard and left.  Called, they were going to send him back.  Didn't happen.  I called again and the lady I spoke to was WONDERFUL!  The tech (not our usual) showed up, rang bell.  I do like this company, they have ALWAYS fixed things or worked with us, even coming again for ants!  Thanks Moxie!< /text>< pics>

It was so bad I cancelled the same day. Good luck trying to reach someone in Management to talk to once they have your money you can forget about it. Be sure you read the fine print cause they will try and get you for additional money. Shame On You Moxie.
I have never written a review before but it's been so bad I had too. Try any others but this one.< /review>< rating>

The technician showed up promptly at 8 a.m. and was very helpful in explaining everything he was going to do and performed each task professionally both inside and outside the home. He also assessed the front yard with the amount of ants that were in the front along the house and explained the granules he was placing down to combat those ants outside the home instead of just a barrier or spray. This was my first experience with Moxie and so far so good, even my wife was pleased with the professionalism of our technician Julio.<//text>

<rating>4< /rating><Review>The younger man was very polite and asked if I had any questions before he got started.  I asked him where his face mask was.  He said it was in the truck.  He went back to put it on without hesitation.  I appreciated that he had it on the whole time he was mopping off cob-webs up high.  The other man sprayed the perimeter of our place.  He held a mask up in front of his nose and mouth, but did not seem to want it around his ears, which was OK.  I was blowing leaves by where the spraying had just been done.  I went to the other side of the house to see if he could spray two places on our front porch, but they had already put the bill on the door knob and left.  I would have like to have them spray more, but did not have the chance before they were gone.  I guess they did a good job.  They were certainly fast.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I’ve been using Moxie Pest Control for almost 5 yrs. Today, 1/19/21, Jose Gutierrez was the technician who sprayed my home today.  When spraying around the house today, he must have kicked one of my landscape lights and it broke. The least he could have done was letting the homeowner know he accidentally broke the light instead of me finding it out later. I’m very disappointed and am contemplating canceling  their service at this time.<//Text>

Always friendly and very helpful when I have questions.  Very professional.
Update when service is coming is great.
Last year I had a major new bug issue and they were ready and willing to come immediately to take care of the situation.  And, they did take care of the bug issue for sure.  They also called after the service to make sure everything was ok.  Several follow-up calls after as well.  I know if I had any problems, Moxie is ready to help in any way.  Thank you for your text messages and for caring about your customers.< /review>

Technician, Julio was very friendly, professional and thorough..
I like that the materials used are pet friendly, yet effective and kills, ants, spiders, earwigs, etc.. Also, they will return in between regular scheduled maintenance if there is a problem at no additional charge. There is a lot of greenery around my home and I hate bugs! I usually start seeing bugs again after about 5-6 weeks after service. I called the company again, and they returned with no hassle.< /Review>

I had to call because I was promised my rates would not change and even when they could not find the notes of my conversations they went ahead and honored my request.

< Review>
We’ve been using Moxie for more than two years. Before using their service, we were constantly finding black widow spiders in our garage and patio areas. Since using Moxie, our spider and insect problems have been resolved. Their employees are friendly and courteous and eager to help whenever there is an issue.<//Review>

**BEWARE OF SCAM!** I have been greatly disappointed in the quality of Moxie's products. My husband was tricked into this RIDICULOUS "contract" where he was promised a low initial cost and then subsequent services scheduled quarterly. Each time they come out, we have forked out over $100 and then STILL have to deal with nasty spiders and bugs!! They have sprayed inside twice now and I honestly see no difference. I called to complain and see what could be done and all they told me was that since they gave my husband a great deal on the first service, we would have to pay $180 to cancel!!! WHAT. THE. HECK. They claim their services are satisfaction guaranteed but if you want a refund, nope. Can't get one. So now we have to buy at least 2 more services (at $120 each) or pay $180 to cancel! What a friggin RIP OFF. Be very careful of what you sign up for. I have never heard of a company offering to come back out and spray more of their product (that doesn't work) in lieu of a refund like any other reputable company would give. I do not recommend this company and will be sharing this review on all my social media platforms to warn others!</review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Sat down With Moxie Rep. Jordan and he was an absolute gentlemen! He was incredibly understanding and accommodating to our needs. So he sold us on Moxie. Then I was contacted by Ryan, she was from the office and was a complete professional. There was a discrepancy on our 1 year contract , but she took care of it right away and the issue was immediately resolved.
The very next day(today), Charlie arrived during the time he was scheduled (a huge deal! Bonus points!) Charlie went over everything he would be doing and was ready to answer any questions I might have. Charlie went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.
Overall, Moxie has started this service agreement off right! If your're looking for a great team who will take care of you, give the Moxie team a call. These guys service several of the houses in my neighborhood, so they must be doing something right!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Door to door salesmen are probably the rudest people I've encountered. I tell them no thank you and point to my obvious "No solicitation" sign. After I shut my door they hit my door one more time, ring the door bell and flip off my camera.</review>

<Text>Stay away from these people. They sold me on a quarterly rate where they come out every 3 months. They said if have any issues in the 3 months they would come out again. I was having the same problem with ants less then 30 days. They charged again for the visit saying the quarterly starts now. Such lies they sold me on. Shame on them.</Text>< Pictures>

If I could give a zero, I would. Note that there is a $160 termination charge, and their sales won't tell you until you signed the contract and terminated the service. And their quarterly service charge is way too high than any other company. DON'T USE THEM!< /Text>

I’ve used pest control companies before and their customer service was horribleeeeee it honestly felt like they had no education about pests they were just given the job, but when Moxie came he literally informed me of things i didn’t know about, he updated me and told me what he was there to do and when he was done he didn’t just leave he updated me again, let me know the next steps and i felt comfortable. Literally saw results that day, pincher bugs started crawling out and dying lol thanks Moxie!</Review>

My husband wants to cancel your service because the sales person who sold us the contract lied to us and said my niece up the street had your service and loved it. That is why we switched, but she has never had your service.

Cristian did a complete job of treating my house. He took his time and made sure all areas were properly taken care of. I even saw him look at the trap that is set outside of my garage for rats and mice. I have not seen that before. I would like to have Cristian be my regular service person if that is possible.

<Time>1562966176139< /Time><review>Never received contact prior to them showing up. Thank goodness we were home because our protective dog was in the backyard. Very disappointed with the service. The sales guy really upsold what they would be doing. The guys who sprayed was in and out in less than 15 minutes. Was told he would be checking inside our house and garage as well. And not to mention I walk out my front door and all the cob weds and eggs from what he took down we’re just on the ground and left for me to clean. Happy it wasn’t my kids that walked outside. Very disappointed in the company. Was excited to see the outcome of everything that he stated would be done. And not to mention the call you have to do prior to them coming out, went over everything the sales rep told me and still they didn’t do half the stuff they stated would be done.<//review>< Pictures>

The customer service department & sales staff are excellent! I did however experience a lack of professionalism with the tech that came to my house for service. While inside my home I could over hear him speaking with a friend about his previous evening. I did not appreciate the language he was using well within earshot of my 11 year old son. My husband, family, & I do not use words that he chose to say aloud in front of my closed bedroom window that I could hear clear as a bell. If he wishes to have casual conversations with friends on work time he may want to think about what he’s saying, how he’s choosing to express himself & who can hear him. Not professional at all!< /text>

They were very professional. They came within the window of time scheduled. They let me know an hour before they were to arrive. They explained what they would be doing. They sprayed the outside and the inside as I requested. They were very friendly. They did a great job!</review>

Just got my first service done by Moxie. Joe the technician was amazing! Very professional and thorough. He took down all the spider webs around the house, then sprayed the exterior before moving on to the inside. He was very thorough and explained everything. Great customer service.

Our property has some unique problems with ants (the way they get into the house) and ALSO spiders that I have been terrified of since childhood.  Alex genually cared about my concerns and left me a with a feeling of confidence that I wouldn't have problems in the for see-able future. And if it should happen,  a single call to Moxie would bring a trained tech back to our home within a few days at no charge.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Moxie has been an excellent Pest Control Service Provider.  I have had above and beyond service since day one, which I did not expect.  Every technician that has come out has done the job perfectly, especially or favorite Jered Alt.

Jared has always been always been professional and has been the most personable and professional Pest Control person ever.  We are very happy with him and Moxie treating our home.

Definitely recommend Moxie as a Pest Control company!< /review>< Rate>

This salesperson from orange county was in menifee trying to sell me the service and was really pushy with little boundaries. I went in my house to discuss it with my wife and came back out and I told him that I like to take my time and that I will follow up with him asap, because I was actually interested in the service. I said "that's your number on that magnet you gave me right?" He responds "I'm going to have to take that magnet back since your not a customer." I was done at that point and assertively asked him to get off my property and threw that business card out my door way. He didn't want to leave. I went from asking him to leave to having to tell him 3 times to get off my property. You can keep your petty magnet! You will never have my business!!! I will make sure my neighbors know.</review>

I noticed the application on the yard was simply hand throwing material poured out of a cup. The application was done here and there not uniformly. Simply...hurry up and get out of here.  Spray application was not done under pool chairs or other out door furniture as explained When contract was signed. It was only sprayed around the furniture area. Spray application was not completed around the entire pool. This was all noticed from security cameras.< /review>

I lived in Murrieta CA 40026 notting hill rd. I sign up for the service. Guys came very next day to resolve the problem. Didn’t help. After 3 weeks they came again and no results. They was 4 times at my house with no results. Stuff is nice and friendly but - no results. I had to move to another house within few miles away from previous adress. They call to setup another service #5 ... but we moved already. Charging me cancellation fees 150$- I’m ok with that and I paid as well.try to avoid this service. Maybe they use right chemicals but guys didn’t spray properly 4 times even after $ tips. They nice and friendly on the phone but house full with roaches. Will never recommend them. They promised to resolve the problem but I guess didn’t work out. People try to call someone else.im father of 5 kids and the oldest one is 10 years old blind disable kid. He was always on the floor...im  very upset</Review>

Your tech showed up at the appointed time.  He spoke to both of us.  He did the work outside, we think, but with the rain it was hard to tell.  When we went to look for him, we found the bill on our front door in a water-proof bag.  We were here, but did not hear if he knocked or rang the door bell.  We were told the chemicals in the spray were moisture resistant, so they would not wash off in all the rain.< /review>

I had David H. come out and I’ve had him a few times now. He is all around great! He explains things before he does it so I know what’s going on. Before spraying inside the house he makes sure I’m okay with certain areas prior to spraying. He always explains to me how the chemicals work. It’s great!!<//Review>

We specifically agreed in advance on multiple occasions that the Moxie technician would arrive between 10:00 am and 12:00 noon.   On 8/10/19, the technician did not call beforehand to say that he was running late.  I received a text message after 12:00 noon saying that the person  was 30 minutes away.  When I responded to the text message and called the office directly, I was told that the technician had already provided service????  WTH!!!<//Text>

Moxie has always been effortless in keeping insects at bay. They come to your house every few months and do routine maintenance so there are no more infestations. Great company to work with!<//review>

Jared serviced my home and was very helpful in answering my questions. I contacted the office to inquire about additional detailed services and they were very accommodating and responsive. They scheduled David to come out for an assessment. David was very professional; answered all of my questions and put my mind at ease. Thank you!<//review>

Moxie is a wonderful post control company. They have kept my animals flea and tick free for over 2 years now. The help with snails, ants, spiders, and pincher bugs os also greatly appreciated from my family and garden.</Review>

Charles Sanders  got to my house 15 minutes before the scheduled appointment time, this is great,  he can start early and finish early so I'm not tied down waiting and can go about my day.

Moxie’s customer service was excellent.  All of the employees that we interacted with were kind and helpful.  We needed help with a flea problem in our house that had not responded to our efforts (foggers, soap dishes, diatomaceous earth, etc).  We noticed results right after their first treatment.  We were very pleased!<//Review>

The technician was here for 12 min from the time he rang the doorbell to the time he left the receipt at front door. 12 min for 130.00? We used to pay 50.00 less for double the time spent treating our front and back yards with the same quality. I know I can always have you come back out but we shouldn't have to deal with that hassle.

I was told by the salesman that the chemicals they use were pet friendly and yet, I find out these are really strong chemicals that can kill my bird, dogs and fish.

After following the guy spraying, he said he doesnt even spray higher than his hips....what about the wasps up high? What about the spiders in the bushes????

Now I feel they got me locked into a year contract that I cannot break. You need to beware if you are not getting the proper service. This is our first day and I am already disappointed.<//review>

Since I started their service I don’t see any insects in my backyard and inside the house. We had lots of ants problem inside our house every year, now not even one ants or spiders inside the house.
I strongly recommend Moxie Pest Control great service and friendly staff.</text>

CROOKS, STAY AWAY!  Signed me up thru a salesmen at my door which I never do, lied about payment plans and had me sign a tablet and gave me no contract.  Later said I signed a contract that was much different then what I agreed to in person and started charging my card.  Also my house was NEVER bug free and was only worse after their 2 visits which in the end cost me almost 500 dollars!

Edit - They commented below they were sorry for the miscommunication, so sorry they charged me again and forced me to go thru my bank to stop charging.  Not very sorry it seems.< /Review>

Unfortunately, I was working at the time Moxie employees came to service our home, but my husband was home and he was very impressed with the service. He said the guy did a lot.....cleaning spider webs and such, besides just spraying around our home.</Review>

<text>Cody Merrylees, the tech that came out to do the spraying, was a sweetheart ! He answered all my questions and gave me details of what to expect. I can not yet rate the effectiveness of the spray eliminating the ants/spiders since my initial spray was just 2 hours ago....but I wanted to give a shout out to our wonderful experience with Cody ! It was an extra hot/muggy day and he was a trooper ! Hope the spray is as effective !</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1532460250249, 'text': "Hooray for sweethearts like Cody!

I was very surprise when I gave him the payment first and He said you can pay when I'm finish, I was shock because the last serviceman I had told me that he had to collect before the job started so I just assume it was Moxie Normal requirement payment up front. David really took his time and he asked me questions regarding any pest problems of concern, this serviceman was concern about doing a THOROUGH job and he did it no rush and even reminded me that I had left the key in the gate. I will contact Moxie to let then know that I will want Mr. David to be my serviceman for now on and I will recommend Moxie Service to my cousin whom just purchase a new home in Riverside thank you  CJ haymond< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>{'time': 1539015835121, 'text': "Thank you so much for spreading the word, CJ!

I have been very happy with the service for over a year, but gave 4 stars because of an incident today. I had to be home to keep my two small dogs inside while they sprayed the back yard which was scheduled for today.  I waited until 3:30pm and had to run to the store up the street for dinner. I received a text at 4:05pm that they were 30 minutes out which was plenty of time to get home. Then one minute later at 4:06pm I received another text saying they were servicing my home but the dogs were out so I'd have to reschedule for the back yard  I immediately texted back letting them know I was right up the street.  I also told them that if the dogs were inside (which they always run inside when someone is in the backyard) to go ahead and spray. They won't come back out before I get home.   They texted and said they would pass my message on to the tech. And then silence.  I finnaly get a text saying they couldn't service the backyard and that I'd have to reschedule. Really? In 10 minutes the tech had discovered the dogs, texted the office, then sprayed the whole front yard and dusted the spider webs? IDK, it just felt like what is the point of being a loyal customer who makes every payment on time if they cannot extend a simple courtesy.  And honestly, if I would have had the 30 minutes like the first text stated, I would have been home and this wouldn't have happened.  :( In all fairness, they do a great job and I have been really pleased.</review>

<Review>David Huerta has been to our house several times rain or shine. He is very professional and friendly. I checked several other pest control places before selecting moxi over a year ago.  Best prices and outstanding service.

Yesterday we had Jered Alt. He did an excellent job as well. Very professional.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Time>

<Text>Commercial Acct. - I was not happy that you refused to do the empty apts. in addition to the  two apts. per month which was my understanding and what you have done in the past. It is especially surprising because last month there were no apt. to service - so it was just outside service that was provided.    In addition to that, the cost of gopher service was high, especially when I'm already paying for your service....and then I still have gophers which you refused to service today as well...There was NOT Much Moxie in my day today.  Not happpy with the customer service at all.< /Text><GmapID>0x80dcb131a9e03249:0xc74166cd0fb6c380</GmapID>< name>

< Review>
Commercial Acct. - I was not happy that you refused to do the empty apts. in addition to the  two apts. per month which was my understanding and what you have done in the past. It is especially surprising because last month there were no apt. to service - so it was just outside service that was provided.    In addition to that, the cost of gopher service was high, especially when I'm already paying for your service....and then I still have gophers which you refused to service today as well...There was NOT Much Moxie in my day today.  Not happpy with the customer service at all.< /Review>

Joe was great !
My 85 year old Mom has dementia and was convinced that apiece of string  on the floor was a bug in her room ! She insisted on having him spray in there . He went in there and sprayed the room and picked up the string off the floor and put in his pocket and let my Mom know that he zapped them all and she could now rest well ! Thanks for going above and beyond the call of duty!<//text>

I recently canceled my service with Moxie due to making a false promises. I origimaly  offered a certain quote for quarterly service
I was going to change to a different Vendor due to a better price for the same service when I notified Moxie they made me a a false promise they comited  to a reduction on previously quoted price therefore I was very pleased with their way of customer service and retention. But 6 mo tha later I get a  notification that my rate was going to go up even higher than I was paying before. When i spoke to the Manager she was very rude and told me that there was no way i could get that rate and there was nothing she could do therefore I told her to cancel my account since they would not honor their previous commitment. I am not satisfied with the way this was handled therefore I am took my business to another provider.</Text>

Had Rep Jordan come out and tell me all bout the services they offered. Signed up for a next day start.....Field Expert Marc came out and took care of my bug issues. He was very professional and answered my questions. They showed up within the ETA they gave me and also called me to inform me that they were on the way. Thank you Marc.</Review>

We have had Moxie for several years and have always appreciated the courteous service we have been provided with by all of the field experts we have had.  This continues to be the case with Wesley, and he was able to identify where our pest problem was (pigeons) and gave us suggestions about how to take care of the problem.< /Text>

We had a serious ant problem and had a previous pest control company called Hawx, but they weren’t able to remove them.

Then eventually one day a man named, Michael Fleming, came to my door and offered to remove the ants if I swapped over to “Moxie Pest Control.” I hired him right on the spot and scheduled my service for the next day.

The ants were preparing for the attack by fortifying their homes in my yard all night. When the Moxie trucks showed up in the early morning the battle of ANTwerp began. Michael suffered many grevious wounds, but the ants had even more casualties. The battle waged within the span of a two hour window.  Eventually the ant queen was slain and the ants were forced into retreat in my floorboards where they went into hiding.

Thanks to my warranty I just kept calling Moxie and they kept coming back for free finding the survivors in my floorboards. One of them went by the name “Ant Frank.” She kept a record of the battle and the said hiding afterwards. Eventually she was caught and moxie took her to an unnamed location where she was never heard from again.

Moxie did an excellent job and I would recommend them to my friends.<//text>

I have had 3 different pest control company’s in last 5 yrs . Moxie is by far the best pest control I have ever had - they came the day I called and did a fantastic job - fleas can get overwhelming overnight
And the customer service is great - no contracts
And a great price . Thank you Moxie pest control
You guys are great . Patti<//Text>
