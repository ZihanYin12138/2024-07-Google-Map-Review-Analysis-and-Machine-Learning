<text>I had the worst experience ever! My sister and I visit this nail shop on 2/13/21 and the services was horrible...They kept trying to tell us what would look best for us and not doing what we was paying them for...They overcharged me( they said my nails was 50$ feet was 36$ but charged my card $94 ! two nails broke the same day , because they wanted to be cheap and use less nail powder then possible! one lady named Jane was taking off my old nails and ripped the corner of my nail and skin off , where I began too bleed!<//text>< rate>

I have been a customer of this place for more than 10 years!! Lately they have been rude and not trying to provide service to me.  I feel like my business does not matter to them.  I don’t think a loyal customer for more than 10 years should be treated the way I was.  And I went there even though services are not great and they are over priced.  I guess I stayed with them cause I don’t like change but there are attitude now is making me change to another nail spa!😡</Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Review>Aware that this is a Vietnamese-owned nail shop, I understand that sometimes there maybe language barriers. HOWEVER, this doesn't excuse rudeness and disrespect. These ladies handle customers very unprofessionally. You should NEVER treat a person the way they treated my mother, much less a CUSTOMER. VERY RUDE, DISRESPECTFUL, AND UNPROFESSIONAL STAFF.

bad customer service!!!  I’ve had the worst experience with them yesterday and the lady at the very back of the table was super rude.  So long story short  I came in the first Time to get a full set and a cool design on my nails and I went home unsatisfied  because I didn’t like the square shape so I felt uncomfortable.  And the powder still look to fake and fake and it was just so sloppy I didn’t like it.  So the next day I went back and it was the worst mistake!!!!  I explain to the lady politely of why I didn’t like my shape and I wanted to reshape my nails to a coffin instead and she got so offended,  repeating herself saying that I liked it but of course I did at first,  but I’m allowed to complain about my nails I am also a customer.  So as soon as she sat me down she really tried to charge me $10 for the same nail design I had before and $10 for reshape.  It was absolutely ridiculous I was so mad and her attitude was just ugly and not cute !  She tried to rip me off   . DO NOT COME HERE.<//text>

About a month ago, I came here for a full set, almond shaped, and walked out unsatisfied because they didn’t look nicely filed. I went home and fixed it myself. I decided to give them one more chance and went in yesterday for a fill. HUGE MISTAKE. I asked the lady if she can trim my nails just a bit because they were long. She quickly filled them but didn’t really go over it with her tool, which left acrylic all over the edges of my nails over lapping on my skin, which looked really off when nail polish went over it. She also didn’t file my nails correctly. I left really bummed out. I feel like she rushed with me because she wanted to attend the woman that came after me, looked like a customer that she has a relationship with. Never coming back here ever again!!!!!!< /text>

If I could give 0 stars I would. First off the moment we walked in they were rushing us to our seats and didn’t let us look at the colors. Then the lady doing my pedi she was very aggressive and rude. She hurt my foot and nails. On several times I asked her to please be gentle and it was as if I was speaking to the wall. I asked for a creamy white I came out with pink nail polish. Terrible! I guess if your looking for cheap, quick and small verity of colors come here. May I add there are air holes in my tows already and I’ve finished about 3 minutes ago.</review>

<Review>I normally only get my eyebrows done here because they do a great job but when i got a full set and pedicure it just wasn't a great experience i asked for long nails she cut them to short and the lady who did my pedicure was pointing out the discoloration on my leg and asking if it was infected and I explained to her that I've had it for years it's a discoloration from being burned when I was a child so just made me feel very uncomfortable so I will never return not even to get my eyebrows done< /Review>< pictures>

Horrible service!! Rushed through both mine and my moms pedicure. They didn't even rub the lotion out on my legs. And they weren't busy at all. Place is completely dirty, towels overflowing the bin, dead bugs all in the window, and they don't use new supplies on your nails! So rude. I won't ever be coming back here again.< /Review>

Went here to get a fill sat down with lady in the back table... she looked at my nail and told me that they were ugly I asked her can you please fix them and that's the reason I went to that location.... she gave me the nastiest look ever then started speaking in a different language, by then another woman walked up an they both started to look at an point at my hands,then she said my nail polish was cheap an I needed gel, I told her I painted them myself an the polish was OPI she then smirked an apologized jokingly. By this time I asked my sister to pick a color for me since I decided not to go with gel... (she seemed upset I didn't get gel) the fill was horrible an she also cut me with the drill my nails look yellow and deformed the shop it self was small and dirty the women were rude except for one lady named Stacy.... other then her good luck worst place ever don't go to this place...< /review>

Worst place in the world I got a ring worm here twice. The first time I wasn't sure where I had gotten it. Mind you I'm not a dirty person I clean my bathroom very well with bleach. There was only one explanation this nail salon. Please beware this place is dirty.</text>

<text>Got a fill and pedi here. I was not a happy girl. At first she gave me a price then at the time to pay she completely changed it. Then she didn't want to accept my form of payment. Which was a complete hassel. My nails didnt come out to my expectations including the fact I brought a picture. Pedi was ok. Place isn't fancy but the pro is it was quick and really no wait time. Still, I would not to this location again.</text>< Pics>

< review>
There is bad customer service. I asked then to do my eyebrows that I had already paid, the lady told me to come back next week to let her finish, so I came back and she keeps tell me to come back the next and the next week. So then i called her, and told her to finish my eyebrows, and she hung up on me rudly telling me to come again next week. I do not recommend this place.< /review>

Best CHAN CHAN from SD just to get their food to-go! Their wings with Chan Chan & Honey sauce are so addicting! It will make you go back for more! Not to mention, the spicy tuna and beef kimbap are soooo bomb!

We will always come back here! Highly recommend! I think their chicken is better than bon chon.

Customer service is great and they never mess up on our order!<//Text>

Korean Fried Chicken: 11/10
Honestly, this has got to be my favorite Korean fried chicken. Despite the usual long lines, I always find myself coming back munching on their delicious chicken! It's perfectly crunchy, and oh so tender! Their wings are way better than their tenders, but both are  so freaking delicious. I just think the wings holds the juices way better than the tenders do. Also, PLEASE TRY THEIR SWEET GARLIC SAUCE. I normally am not the type to like garlic flavored food, but this just compliments their chicken so well!

Chanchan Kimbab: 10/10
The kimbap is certainly worth the bang for the buck. It's huge. If you grab one small fried chicken and one kimbab, its certainly good for two people. (mind you, my friends and I eat a lot, and grabbing one small fried chicken and two kimbaps was WAY too much). It's a typical traditional kimbap, and you really can't go wrong ordering it! It's delicious!

Other:
I was actually not a big fan of their white pasta. It was just too much sauce for the amount of pasta they gave you, and pretty bland. But I don't think most people come here for their pasta anyways.I think that if you stick to the fried chicken, kimbap, or other korean foods,  that it's already fantastic.

Overall: Price is fantastic. I don't think the add-ons are worth it, but they're not baldy priced either. Food is great! Especially their fried chicken and kimbap! Wait time is so-so, depending on when you get there. If you're coming at peak hours (lunch time or dinner time or post work) expect atleast a 20-30 min wait. But honestly, the fried chicken is worth waiting for!</Text>

I could probably eat here everyday, but that would be unhealthy lol, so instead I'll just give a big FIVE STARS and highly recommend! My favorites are the chicken bites, spam kimchi fried rice with cheese on top, and any of the kimbaps. It's all delicious, but I think if you try these three things you definitely won't be disappointed. The wait can be long at times, but I really don't even mind because I love the food that much. You can also order take-out if you are short on time or don't want to wait. The service is also always super friendly and food is served fast.< /Text>

Food was good.  Even though the food is Korea's equivalent to fast food, it did take some time for the food to come out.  I do wish they would put less sugar in everything.  Most dishes tasted sweet.  It's definitely not a healthy place, but more of a comfort food store.  No long lines and plenty of space/tables.  The interior was modern and clean.  AC was nice.</review>

It is one of the common dishes in their resto. And also their Kimchi (fermented vegetables) one of their oldest dishes. Without kimchi, dinner is considered incomplete. I am very satisfied with their food.</review>

oh how i miss this chicken, and how i regret not ordering even more on my second trip through. the sauce i ordered the first time was a little too ketchup-y for my taste, but still was pretty good. the second time i ordered i got sweet garlic sauce and it was, just the absolute best. i didn’t even care that it was cold by the time i had brought it home, it was just that delicious. 10/10 absolutely understand the hype< /text>

If you ever go to Chan Chan, these are the must try items: Sweet garlic chicken (you can order extra sauce to dip the chicken with... their sauce is the bomb) ; spicy cream cheese kimbap, chan chan kimbap or beef kimbap... all are very yummy!! Also the soup from beef ricecake is very unique, love it so much. The queue could be long during dinner time, especially on the weekend. You can put your name down on the list and go shopping around (Daiso, Mitsuwa...) while waiting. Highly recommended!!</review>

Easily the worst banchan I've seen.  See pictures.  Never came by to refill, but maybe this is the kind of restaurant where that doesn't happen?

Plastic and paper cups?  This is super wasteful.  Also, why are the cups is so small? well I'm eating your salty food, I need water which means I have to continually get up to get some.

One thing I think can be fixed is tipping at the beginning of the meal. This means no incentive to make patron experience enjoyable, or even convenient.

The reason I might be a little unfair in this review is because I recently found out it was fast food. So maybe support service should be expected?<//text>< name>

Great Korean self serve bun-shik house.  The kimbap is huge and tasty.  Also try the Kim mari. Which is Chapchae noodles wrapped in seaweed and then feed fried in batter.  The menu is quite large and has something for every craving.  This place is an extension of the restaurant just next door.<//Review>

< review>
The place had a very nice atmosphere. The portion size of the food was very good. We ordered the chicken bites with the sweet chilli sauce. We ordered the sauce on the side and we were happy we did because the sauce was overly sweet without any hint of chilli. We also had the Kimchi and spam fried rice and the chan chan spicy rice cakes. The fried rice was a little too greasy for my liking but the flavor was all there. We absolutely loved the rice cake. It has a sweet taste when you first eat it and then the chilli hits the mouth. It hurts to eat but it's so good you can't stop. It was very delicious. I would most definitely recommend this place and I will be back for sure.</review>

Delicious fried chicken with an option of sauce on the side.  Our order came with four side dishes of kimchi.  Spam and kimchi fried rice is served on a sizzling hot plate which is wonderful since we like our food piping hot.<//text>

<Text>This spot will remind you of college time with chicken wings, kimbap, spam kimchi fried rice, fried dumplings, and rice cake. This restaurant targets young customers and college students who need quick and trendy food. This is a good spot to grab lunch, dinner with friends, or simple dinner after school/work. One more of the advantage is it locates in a very convenient complex that attracts traffic to the store.

Highlights of the menu:
1. Fried chicken wings with Chan Chan sweet soy
2. Fried chicken wings with sweet garlic
(I prefer dipping over sauce on top to keep the crispiness of the chicken. Wings and tenders are both great)
3. Cream cheese rice cake (ddeck bock ki)
4. Spicy seafood fish cake soup
5. Kimchi and spam fried rice<//Text>< pictures>

Chan Chan is serving yummy Korean Snack foods such as Tteck Bbock Ki
(rice cake with  red pepper paste), Soondae(Korean Sausage),  Fried Chicken, Kimmari(seaweed with noodles), Fried dumpling etc.

You can enjoy snack foods and meals.< /review>

<text>This is more Casual Korean than traditional so don't expect the usual mountain of banchan. Quality food on the other hand is to be expected. They just expanded recently but even then they are always busy. That says a lot about their quality.

Definitely recommend!</text><Name>Bo Tian< /Name>< gmapID>

Probably a good place if you are in your early 20's and don't care about food quality. This is food from a bar not so much a restaurant. At my age, I've had great tasting, high-quality food and this place wasn't for me or my family. We were probably not the target patrons and will not return.< /text>

19 small pieces of Spam in their Kimchi Fried Rice 'With Spam'. Third time I've ordered for takeout only to find no chopsticks. Luckily this time I was at home.
Also no napkins provided.</Review>

<Text>Decent experience of Korean food.

Chicken is way overpriced but soft inside and crispy outside(6/10 if not for the batter). Sagol ramen is on the salty side and soup base is underflavored(salty but not enough savory), but good for a quick bite.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Reviewing one star because of the telephone orders. It is extremely hard to hear over the telephone with lots of background noise. And coming here and my order came out wrong. They said "the thing is, we always review the order over the phone" understood, but it would make it easier for us customers if we were able to hear very clearly which was a need that was not being met. I felt rushed when I was ordering over the phone.< /review>

<text>Great place for small groups. They don't have a lot of seating and there's usually a small wait, but it is well worth it. You have to go up to the register to order once you're ready to, but they'll bring the food to you. They have wet wipes for people who eat with their hands, and a water station as well. Other drinks are available. Their sauces are offered either mixed in or on the side. Their kimbap rice roll came with 10 pieces. Their rice cake dishes have options for extra cheese for a dollar which is totally worth it.<//text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyseS8rbgqlf63fMLvfK_dXwwtwy68jHHA6ZJe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

I'm surprised of how good their fried chicken is. It's not made here. It's made in heaven. It's very godly!  It's like we are brought to astral plain. It's very crispy yet juicy. Their fried squid is also good. Their kimchi spam fried rice is a great compliment to the whole experience.

Absolutely recommended.

I was so disappointed about manager.
I was order of phone call he told me very rude.
When I ask about food also very annoying to me.
After when I picked up my food and I ask him about who got my call and he got my call and he is manager of restaurant. Please when you feeling is not good don't take any order. I don't understand why I feel bad when I buy food and pay for it.  I'll not be going again, but the boss will have to re-educate the staff and training the manager. This is service job!!!!!!< /review>

<text>Food is decent, I think I've had better for a much lower price. But my problem with this restaurant was not the food, rather it was the customer service. Walked in, not a single greeting (although they greeted every other Asian customer. I'm Hispanic sooo i don't know about that). On the other hand, I approach the cashier, and I'm on a good mood, I'm ready to greet them with a smile, but the first thing he says is "Hold on" puts his hand out to me, and continues with his technical
Difficulties on his POS.

Not only was I taken back from His tone, but after that, I was just irritated... it looked like the boss of this cashier noticed my demeanor change so he tried to apologize and say "please hold on" and sort of grinned and FINALLY made eye contact with me.

Few minutes went by and they finally took my
To go order. This was originally a Postmates order but got to keep the food since my Customer did not pick it up. I asked for extra red sauce on the side and all he said was "unavailable". I asked why? And he just kept saying "unavailable". So... let me get this straight... you can't give me sauce on the side?? Okay... I just handed him my card and wanted to pay and get it over with..

Again: food was decent, but paying $57 for 4 items was a little much for me.

Definitely did not tip. Definitely won't be coming back. I Didn't feel welcomed here.

A tip to the owner: teach your son or whoever this cashier is some manners of common courtesy... (just because I don't speak your language doesn't mean you treat me like an idiot). One of your servers kindly answered my question, but he was in the kitchen. Your front cashier needs to soften up.<//text>< username>

Very clean and neat, inside this small restaurant. The services were great, and I recommend this place for family lunch or dinner, although this place can get very busy during weekends. The food is okay, not too good or too bad, and I think it has reasonable price.< /Review>

Chanchan is korean street/soul food style restaurant, and its the only decent one near the Irvine area in my opnion.
I have tried all kinds of their menu while being a regular here for the last five years. While sweet garlic chicken and the spicy squid rice cake/chanchan rice cake are the most notable/popular items, there are some menus that people are afriad to try but are surprisingly really good. So i think its bebficial for everyone for me to share while reviewing this place.

Spicy cream cheese kimbap- i know; the 'cream cheese' part throws everyone off, and i am not a fan of cream cheese inside rice rolls either lol. However, this rice roll came as a big surprise. The spicy sauce in the rice roll balances out the usual greasiness that is present normally in the cream cheese rolls. Moreover, they spread their cream cheese inside the rice roll, not put chunks of cream cheese in it (which is the main reason normal cream cheese rolls throws me off) As far as I know, everybody was surprised and mostly loved it once they tried this roll!

Bibim pasta- this one is similar to jjol-myun. It is chewy pasta noodles mixed with spicy, sweet, sour sauce with a lot of vegetables. So it can be a little bit like a noodle-salad. It is also the only few vegetarian menus available here, but it is full of flavor. I regularly crave this pasta haha. The pasta however is normally too saltly for my taste so i always ask for 'less salty' option when i get this.

Red red bites with cheese added on top- yes, the name sounds intimidating, i know. And it even looks intimidating too, with the chicken covered in really red-looking sauce. But it is actually not that spicy- like you dont have to be a spicy lover to enjoy this spicy. I think that it is only a little bit spicier than regular chan chan rice cake. And the sauce is really really good. Personally, i think it is better than the chanchan chicken sauce (the spicy-sweet soy). And with melted mozzarella cheese added on top, the chicken becomes heavenly.

Spicy seafood fish cake soup- i noticed that a lot of people usually get regular fish cake soup when they crave some broth with their food. But i recommend this soup because the difference of flavor between the two is substantial. The spicy fish cake soup is packed with seafood flavor (and also contains seafood other than fish cake). If you enjoy the spicy seafood noodle here, than you will also enjoy the soicy fishcake soup(they taste similar). So it is worth a try.

These are the menus that I can think of right now, but i will update my review once i get to taste more new menus!

The place also used to be small and packed, but they remodeled and expanded to twice the original size, so the service and the atmossphere naturally became much better than before.

I love korean street-style food,and have been eating them all my life(grew up eating the food in Korea). And trust me, this place is the best one in Irvine  and one of the better ones in orange county.< /Text>

1st time here with my husband. Didnt even know what kind of food it was till I sat down to look it up.  Never had koren food at a sit down restaurant before. We did not know what we were ordering. GREAT SERVICE! They helped us choose what to get, glad we stepped out of the box on this one.  The food was delicious!</review>

<text>I was pleasantly surprised to find this place while looking for korean style cold noodle, neng myun. Chan chan features varieties of korean street style foods in Irvine. It looks like the place has been open just recently and there are few things they can improve upon. First the cashier warn us that the food will take 45min to cook even before we put an order. That's a little turn off from customer's perspective even if that's accurate. It turns out the food came out just 10 minutes after we order, so that was good. I immediately noticed that their menu is terrible, none of the pictures of the food matched the description of the food. Okay, enough of my complaints about operation (which I don't base my review on) and talk about food. I ordered their mixed blood sausage, spicy rice cake with squids, and their house special chan-chang kimbop. Kimbop was delicious like how it looks on pictures. Dduk boki has this nice charred and spicy flavor. I highly recommend everyone to get that squid dduk boki. Between that ever chewy rice cake with that more snappy but also chewy texture of squid creates instant classic dish. Their blood sausage or soondae was pretty decent. I usually don't like to order soondae from non-soondae specialized place but I just wanted to try. That was a lot of food for around $30. I will definitely like to come back and tried their chicken wings and other dishes.< /text>< Pics>

I was sooo hungry! I was hungry for Jjampong and she said they had a uniquely flavored version.  Okay. I'm game.  We went to Chan Chan and I walked in 10 mins before they opened and said "may I use your restroom?" They said they didn't have one and to go use the one at the Japanese Market. I thought "ok, i get it, its a small place"  So I went and I did and returned.  By the time I got back the line was full up out the door! I was so excited!  I thought "This place must be great!"  Well she had already ordered and it was Dokbokki, Kim-something (fried noodles in a seaweed wrap) Kimbahp, and Jjampong.  Turns out that its not Jjampong and it's just some type of seafood soup.  Not very good at all.  I'm not picky but I dumped my small bowl back into the large bowl and couldn't eat it.  The rest was just kinda blah.  Keep in mind I was starving and i'm fat and I still didn't like it.  I think the hype is greater than the food.  I usually will try something twice but not this time.  Sorry Chan Chan.<//text>

Great kimbab!  Love the chan-chan kimbab and the spicy japchae.  Their dduk plates are also great.  They close a bit early so make sure you plan to get here before they close!  It will be worth it.</Review>

(Translated by Google) Deep fried chicken, rice cake, Kimbap. Menu-oriented restaurant that young people like. There are actually many students. When the knife is pulled, the broiler scene is not bad.

(Translated by Google) English / Korean Review

I ate Chanchan Gimbap and Sagol Sundae Soup. It was around 1 o'clock on Saturday, so I waited 10 minutes. Gimbap was $ 8.9, and sundae soup was about $ 14. Spicy and soy sauce served together. But the price of $ 9 seems expensive. (CA is expensive for food.) Sundae soup was very different from Korean Style. It's a little salty with 5 ~ 6 sundae and intestines. If you do not like, please ask Sundae ONLY in order. The rice doesn't come out separately. If you like Korean snacks, it is worth a visit, but the price is higher than Korean snacks.

찬찬김밥과 사골순대국을 먹었습니다. 토요일 1시경이라 10분 정도 대기가 있었어요. 김밥은 $8.9 였고 사골순대국은 $14 정도했어요. 김밥은 매콤한 소스와 간장소스가 같이 나와 찍어 먹으니 맛있었어요. 하지만 $9 의 가격이 비싼 듯하네요. (CA 가 음식 물가가 비싸지요) 순대국은 한국 순대국과 많이 달랐는데요. 약간 짠 사골국에 순대 몇개와 내장이 많이 들어있더라구요. 내장 싫어하시는 분들은 순대로만 요청해 보세요. 밥은 별도로 안 나오나 보더라구요. 한국 분식을 좋아하시는 분들한 한번 가볼만 합니다만 한국 분식에 비해 가격은 비싼 편입니다.<//text>

(Translated by Google) It is a pretty good Korean restaurant. Unfortunately, most of the dishes cost more than $ 10.

꽤 괜찮은 한국 음식점입니다. 아쉬운건 대부분의 요리가 10달러 이상이라 2명이서 갔을 때는 한국 분식집처럼 여러개를 시켜놓고 먹기 쉽지 않네요.<//review>

I really liked the gym but their accounting dept (aka Erica Grijalva, manager) is totally unorganized. They charge you fees 3 months later. I’ve been in business a long time and this place needs better communication and professionalism.< /text>

The owners really don’t care about the safety of their members. I wanted to cancel my membership because I didn’t feel safe or comfortable being there anymore and one of the OWNERS said my reason wasn’t a valid reason for them to cancel my membership! How is that not a valid reason!? If someone doesn’t feel safe or comfortable being in a place then they shouldn’t be forced to keep going there! The owner was incredibly rude and disrespectful towards me and boyfriend and we highly DONT recommend anyone signing up at Gold’s gym in Watsonville!!<//review>< Date>

It was better before the gym was reduced to it's  original size. Before the Covid it was always packed and no parking, so once this is over, it will be too packed again.</review>

We camped at New Brighton Beach for Labor Day weekend, but I still needed to get my workouts in. Golds In Watsonville has everything you need to get a great workout regardless of what you're doing.  The facility is clean, the staff was friendly and the locals were focused on getting their workout on - so there weren't people camping on one station forever.</review>

I love my gym especially the aqua classes. Corine the instructor is challenging and yet knows exactly what we need and what we can do. She is fun and has built a community of aqua warriors!  Let's be real, I am a fat person, my gym clothes don't match my shoes and I don't wear cute visors. I huff and puff and I work hard in the water. I wear a bathing  suit with shorts and I feel COMFORTABLE at this gym and in this class. I work hard and I am really strong because of my work out. Check it out.< /review>

It's a little too expensive considering the fact that they reduced the gym space and crammed everything into one section of the building</Text>

<Text>Most of the time, the equipment I need is available. They could use atleast one more set of DB weights, and maybe increments of 2,5LB. As I workout with my lady, and I see other ladies that might like that idea as well. Some members don't put their weights back, which is so annoying. Management has been told, and given ideas, but to no avail.<//Text><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808e1aec459edb07:0x2f99acbee201e653</gmapID><user_name>Refugio Rodriguez<//user_name><Time>1525056990331<//Time><user_id>112047774121236949535</user_id><pics>None</pics><Rate>4<//Rate></record>

I liked until i was physically attacked by an instructor/manager there! The owner hide video footage of the attack from staff and refused to speak with me in person only cause of her close friendship with the attacker! Come to find out though all there equipment is old and out dated and the showers are always needing repair as well! So glad to be at a better gym with new equipment! The best instructors are at 24 fitness and inshape anyways they all are skilled and are a much friendlier group then some of the instructors at golds!!!!! I suggest the drive to sc so worth it!!!< /text>

(Translated by Google) I like the greatness of this gym, they always keep it clean and the areas are very comfortable to do your exercises, of course, you have to take into account the time when you go as in everything, you can fill and it will not be so nice , but there is always room for you.

Excellent customer service. They were able to help me in a pinch. I dropped my S10 and the screen shattered. They were able to help me with a quick screen replacement the same day! Highly recommend them!< /review>

Made by screen look very bootlegged after repairing it for 15 min which is too quick. Seemed like they just wanted easy money. Srsly looked like I had a kids toy iPhone</review>

They told me that it should be an easy repair .
Came back in a hour and my iPad was as good as new .
Fast professional and reliable service.
Will definitely recommend this place to anyone trying to get their Apple devices fixed at affordable prices.< /review><name>yaya<//name>< gmapID>

TO ANYONE OUT THERE TRYING TO GET THEIR PHONES REPAIRED DO NOT GO TO THESE GUYS!!! THEY USE CHINA KNOCKOFFS!!! FIND A REPUTABLE COMPANY THAT USES AUTHORIZED PARTS!!! This place doesn’t deserve a rating for the hack job they did on my phone screen and LSD. They use third party cheap china knockoff parts to repair your phone. They will not cover your costs but will charge you more. Screens are weak, glitchy and defective and will literally just crack out of nowhere. These guys are dishonest and are out to get a quick dollar on people with budgets and will cheat you out of your money. They shouldn’t be operating near a phone at all.</review>

Our Dogs loved their stay at Elaines Pet Resort.  They practically dragged us in the building on our drop off day!  They had a meet & greet a couple of weeks prior.  We picked them up after a 10 day stay and they were perfectly healthy and happy!!  I highly recommend!< /Text>

Have used Elaine’s Pet Resort for years for our dogs. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They offer a variety of packages for boarding your dog, which our dogs have always enjoyed. A complete pet resort! We will continue to use Elaine’s for boarding our dog as long. A 5 star rating place for pets!</review>

They were really good with our dogs, even though my one dog peed on everything and tore up her and her brother's bed. They bagged it up, which I thought was kind of funny.. Not sure what they thought we were gonna do with it once we got home, but it just kind of amused me.< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
My dog had a bad experience at Elaine's.  I gave them specific care information that was not adhered to. She is very lean and lost 3 pounds in a week long stay.  Although their reviews seem very good, unfortunately this was my first and last experience at Elaine's Pet Resort.</Review>

The receptionist was very helpful and it would of been nice to have my pet stay there but unfortunately the meet and greet rule that they have is the reason for the low score what is someone supposed to do when they are coming in from out of state and will be arriving after they're closing times on a friday. Maybe they only take in local customers, also my pet would of needed to stay in a over night kennel during the last 30 days. Im sorry but my dog has a very large back yard during the day and he is inside the house at night 7 days a week they're is no need for him to be staying at over night kennels. Only time i consider it is when we go out of town.<//review>

Cute place with a few frozen yogurt options, tons of beautiful(I can only watch the sugar filled desserts) gelato. They also have banana split, root beer floats, cookies... Not sure if they have regular ice cream. I had the momma Apple pie low sugar frozen yogurt(13 grams for 4oz) it was amazing. Wish they had more options for people watching sugar. My friend had the mango gelato and he said it was delish. Overall it was nice. Good dessert, clean, kind of friendly cashier. I'll definitely go back.
They have great deals a few days of the week. Sunday, Monday and Tuesday I remember, not sure about rest of the week.</text>

< Review>
Always gone here since they've opened and have always been happy with what they offer. However, I think it would be nice if there was more than one non-dairy yogurt flavor, since, as a vegan, it limits what chooses I have. (I will say that the past non-dairy flavors have been great, just would appreciate more of them).< /Review>

<Text>Fifth time I have taken my family here and it just keeps getting worse. I think they don't train employees. Shave ice is important to me, it's my favorite. But I literally threw out more than half of one today. I told them their lime had turned last time that was a year ago and it is still gross like mold. They say they have coconut but they haven't the last three times. I live close, if it was half decent I'd be there weekly. It was an ice brick with old syrup. Gross.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<response>{'time': 1511386225137, 'text': 'First of all please let me personally apologize.  Rather than go into great length in a message, I would greatly appreciate being able to speak with you personally.  In no way is it acceptable that our customers are treated in such a manner regardless of having a bad day, being close to closing or whatever else may have been on employee’s mind.  We are a small family owned business and we strive very hard to impress upon our employees that our Customers are first and foremost our main priority and that our customers are to be treated with kindness and appreciation.  We pride ourselves in superior customer service, and this is not the refection that I want our customers to have of Crazy for Yogurt.\n\nUnfortunately, I do not know which shop, day or time in which this incident occurred.  If you would be interested in speaking with me directly regarding the matter, will you please email me your contact information at info@crazyforyogurt.com.\n\nAgain, I profusely apologize for the way in which you were treated.\n\nLynda F., Owner'}< /response><Text>The yogurt is always good here but tonight I was treated very poorly. I had gastric bypass and not everything sets well on my stomach anymore and tonight I was craving some frozen yogurt. I stopped in and asked to try 3 flavors and the young lady snapped at me stating “your only allowed two, that’s it!” I attempted to explain why I would like the other sample and she refused. I told her I did not like the two flavors I tried, could I please try the third one. She let out a deep sigh and walked away. I told her I understood why they probably had to put the two sample rule in place but I can assure her I would buy something I just wanted to make sure the flavor was going to set on my stomach. She seemed very frustrated for me to even be in the store. She tossed the sample cup on the counter and walked away again. I understand it’s getting closer to closing time and she is starting to clean up, but still no excuse for rudeness! I’m a very polite person and attempted to explain why I asked for one more sample, which ended up being the flavor I got. There were 5 more flavors I could have asked to try but didn’t. I get we all have bad days and she was following what the was instructed in certain , but once again there is not excuse for rudeness! I will not be coming back here again.... even if it’s the only yogurt shop close to my house!! Sorry crazy yogurt but you just lost a customer!</Text><Rate>2</Rate><Name>Shawndra Harrelson< /Name><pictures>None</pictures>< userid>

<Name>Jessica Cates</Name><Time>1542163360835<//Time><rating>2</rating><Review>I would normally give a 5 star review because I love this place and our family has been going for a long time. We came into the shop tonight for a yogurt and I was thrown back by the service we got. When we first walked in we were not acknowledged for a minute because the worker was to busy talking to her friends. After standing there waiting I was rudely asked "what can I do for you". I asked for sample cups and did not know there wasnt samples anymore. I had to get a sample from the worker and one of the samples was not available. I was informed that she would have to get some but instead of helping us she went back to talking to her friends. I am very disappointed and wouldn't of even bothered buying a yogurt tonight if my son wasnt already excited about getting one. I understand not having sample cups anymore but if this new system is going to work than you have to have employees willing to help there customers.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>
{'time': 1543274931850, 'text': 'Hello again Jessica, we have already responded to your review on our Yelp page but we wanted to be sure to address it here as well. Again, we apologize that your visit was less than exemplary as that is never our goal. When we first responded we had yet to speak with our employees, however, after hearing their side of the story it seems more likely that there was a misunderstanding than poor customer service on our part.\n\nI was honestly shocked by your account of what had occurred because I do not believe any member of our staff would blatantly ignore our customers or prioritize socializing so I went in to the store immediately after you posted your review and addressed the situation post haste. For one, I just wanted to clarify that the "friend" our employee was talking to was actually another one of our employees. The second misunderstanding was that when she stated that one of the samples was not available, she said that she explained it was because a flavor change was just performed which means we ran out of one flavor and had to clean, sanitize, and restart the machine with new product. While unfortunate, we cannot predict when this will happen and it does take some time to complete. She mentioned that because it was just changed, it was not quite ready to be served but that she would be able to get you a sample once it was ready which I believe is why there was no urgency to retrieve the sample.\n\nAs mentioned in our previous reply, there is a BOGO available for you on your next visit which is still valid. We just wanted to share our side because every little review can help or hurt our business and a small misunderstanding can make the difference in us keeping the doors open or closing down. We really hope our customers can understand that we do not train our employees to do a terrible job or give bad service but that we are all human and sometimes honest mistakes or miscommunication can happen.\n\nThanks again for leaving a review, we hope we can turn it around on your next visit!'}<//response>

The sign on the door says they're open from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays, and online says they're open until 10 p.m. . Yet when I went in at 9:16, they told me they were closed and then lock the door after I left, even after I told them their sign says they are open until 10 p.m. normally I love this yogurt shop, but I was very disappointed in the staff that was working< /Text>

I've been coming here cause it's closer to my house but lately there's always something going wrong. The machines often don't work and the dryer doors always open when in motion and when you bring it up to the employees they always make it seem like it's your fault. I will no longer come here and it may be closer but there are better laundromats out there. I strongly recommend avoiding this one.< /Review>

The quarter machine stole my 10 dollars. I asked for help and they accused me of lying. The customer service provided by one lady worker was horrible. They will not refund my 10 dollar's until two days when the owner comes and reviews  the cameras. This Business takes advantage of its lower income community and people.</Text>

DON'T WASH HERE !!! THEY HAVE BED BUGS!!! I was washings night with my wife, and as we finished loading up the washers. I bought us some sodas, and we sat by the folding tables as we were talking I had my arm on the table. And I felt a pinch, it was a bed bug biting me so quickly hit it off my arm and started shaking my clothes off! Never going back. Bellow is a picture of the bite.<//text>

<review>I've tried different times and days (just not in the middle of the night) and its always crowded. The place is large and its kept really clean. My only two nitpicks about it are the machines are all frontloaders, so there's no way to separate my laundry into smaller loads. The other is the parking. The main lot is really small and everybody double parks to unload their laundry. There is an upper lot, but then you have to carry your laundry up and down stairs.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

One of the best laundromat I've visited so far. Never too busy, enough washers & dryers, and staff is always friendly. They have a few vending machines for snacks and washing products you may need. There are few arcade games and claw machines to keep the kids entertained. No Wi-Fi.</Text>

We had an amazing experience here! Took us only 30 minutes to complete everything which was amazing considering the DMV takes hours! Definitely would recommend to everyone and I will be coming back with business again! Thank you so so much!< /Text>

I was in need of registration tags and an address change. While google searching I found this awesome place. I got there, and there was no wait. Had both things taken cared of within minutes. This place is awesome and the gentleman that took care of me was respectful and knowledgeable. I really appreciate people like him.</text>

<review>I was recommended to visit Express Auto Registration DMV San Diego to register my vehicle and to do a title transfer. The process was effortless and very affordable. Usually anything to do with the DMV would be highly stressful and involve long wait times... both were avoided by visitng Express Auto Registration DMV San Diego. I will never go back to visitng DMV after such a positive experience. I wish I could give this business ten stars.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Would give 10 stars if I could! Jeilani was soo helpful with assisting me in getting my title transferred for my out of state vehicle and also helping me register my car to California. He provided me with information for where to get smog check completed and also provided me a list of documents I would need for the process. I came in and got everything done in less than 25 minutes. I always dread going to the DMV and being able to come here made my life easier. Jeilani is amazing! Will recommend this place to anyone who needs assistance. Thank you soo much!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Very fast pace service! Jeylani (manager) was able to save me 4 long hours at the dmv and get my paper work done with him in a few minutes. I appreciate the fast service. Also, friendly staff and clean neat office made the experience more comfortable.

Will do my next auto renewal here.</text>

Jeilani was super friendly and efficient. I had a great time at the DMV. A phrase I would never thought I would be saying. By explaining everything he made me feel comfortable with the service and the process was smooth and easy. I was in and out within 20 minutes.<//review>

During this Pandemic as we all know DMV and other services had gone virtual, except the only thing is it’s still in the beta test phase as I had done a title transfer on their virtual office and has not heard back in 3 weeks now. So I google other places and found Express Auto Registration DMV San Diego spoke to a representative there and within a few minutes I was there title transfer, registration renewal and new plates was done in one go with no hassle quick and easy. These guys know what they are doing trust me read other reviews and go check them out. Thanks guys for the quick and easy process you took all my worries and stress away now I can look forward to having my motorcycle on the road again.< /Text>

Went in for auto registration. It was fast and quick service. I was greeted at the door with the smile. They made the process so simple. Nothing beats not having to wait in that long dmv line. I didn’t have to spend the best part of my day in a dreadful line. They were efficient and knew what they were talking about. The prices were competitive and they don’t over price you like the other guys.
Highly recommend express auto registration. I’ve been here for three of my cars. My family has been coming her for years. NO MORE DMV LINES FOR US.<//text>

<text>As someone that's completely new to car registration and everything related to cars, coming here was amazing. Unfortunately, I didn't get his name but he was incredibly helpful and patient. He walked me through each step of my required forms and was incredible efficient. I was able to get my car registered right away and learned more about the services that they and the DMV provides. I learned how easily I can transfer car titles as well. Everything was explained clearly with full transparency and patience. I felt truly taken cared of. If you need to quickly do anything with renewing your car registration and title transfers, this is the place to go!<//text><response>{'time': 1595004591098, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving us wonderful review.

Came in to get my registration renewed. Paid and was out the door in like 10 min or less. Unfortunately that same day was a holiday so the dmv was closed and couldn’t process my registration. Jeilani took copies of my insurance and registration and was able to help me out after hours. And came back the next day while they were closed for the day to pick up my new tags and registration. I highly recommend this place and jeilanis service. fast and easy. Will be going back for future services. Thanks again.<//Text>

I had expired tags and I wasn’t aware. And I wasn’t gonna deal with DMV lines, I stopped by here and I renewed my tags and I was in and out in no time. I will definitely get all my DMV services here.</review>

< Review>
Tag was expired and I didn't want to wait in the DNV long line. My husband told me that he had gotten his tags from Express Auto Registration in the past and they were really quick and nice. I gave it a shot and I was  happy as well! I was out in 5 mins! Keep up the good work Express Auto Registration!</Review>

<Text>Let me start off by saying that I am not one to write reviews, but because of my experience at Express Auto Registration, I had to take time to express my experience and the exceptional service. Mr. Jeilani is one of the friendliest and most outgoing people I have met. I found this place after a quick search for alternative DMV service. I went there around 9:30 and unless than 15 mints, he was about to complete a title transfer. I recommend this place to anyone who is trying to avoid long waits at the DMV and the best customer service. 5/5 for me.< /Text>< pictures>

I highly recommend coming here, pretty sure I was in and out within less than 40 min (beats waiting around in the DMV even if you scheduled an appointment). The gentleman working there was very nice and willing to assist in anyway with renewing my registration. For any military folks, yes you can still get the discount here !< /text>

I am honestly so impressed by how friendly and professional Express Auto Registration is. I was in an emergency situation and needed to do a tittle transfer for my vehicle. I came here and I am so glad I did. Since Jeilani was very patient and helpful and made my experience so much more easy. If anyone doesn't want to deal with the difficulties of going to the DMV this is the perfect place. Will definetly come back in the future.</Text>

I was in need of registration tags and an address change. While google searching I found this awesome place. I got there, and there was no wait. Had both things taken cared of within minutes. This place is awesome and the gentleman that took care of me was respectful and knowledgeable. I really appreciate people like him.

Thanks< /review>

Jeilani (I hope that's spelled right) was very efficient and super polite too! We had plates in hand in about 20 minutes for our out of state vehicle registration. Skip the DMV headache and go to Express Auto Registration instead, it's worth every penny of the fee.</Text>

<Review>I have a car from out of state that I needed to register and I was all excited when I found this place that could take care of it with out going to DMV. I get there on Friday morning at 9:20 and it is closed. Does not make a lot of sense why they are closed when the business hours say otherwise. I found a place called The Tag Shop just a block away, that is in a really cute old house who was open and took care of my situation quickly. They even do the smog check there. I highly recommend not wasting your time driving here and being letting down!</Review><Gmap_id>0x80d957f4e7d69a07:0x5c70d2183886c222< /Gmap_id><resp>None<//resp><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

This place is awesome. I was in and out in about 10 minutes. My registration was over due and had been avoiding going to the DMV because of the long wait. I googled auto registration renewal in San Diego and this place popped up with a great review. It was definitely a good experience, very friendly staff and quick. You can't beat that if you have a busy life. Thank you Express Auto Registration. I highly recommend this place. 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍</text>

I’m international student from Europe. Bought a car I did my smog at USA smog station. The gentleman at the SMOG recommended this place. Express auto registration has made the whole process very easy to do. At first I wanted to go the DMV. Is good I came here at Express auto registration.  I did the Title transfer and got my Tags on the spot. Check out this place and SKIP THE DMV.</Review>

<review>This name and category for this business is incorrect. I was attempting to go to the real DMV when this kept popping up. It is misleading and faulty as this is not a DMV office! I have suggested and edit to Google to update.

Side note this review is not regarding their service but rather how the business has been registered on Google. I am sure the business itself might do what it claims to do.

This review is the fact that this business is listed in Google as if it is the DMV Office. This is incorrect, misleading and frankly illegal to impersonate a government service (much like impersonating an officer)!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Just purchased a car from craigslist, went to the DMV seen that there was a 3 hours wait time, so quickly went on Google and Google searched auto registration places. Express auto registration was the first want to come up, so I called and the gentleman who help me on the phone was courteous professional and very nice. Walked in and got my paperwork done with in six minutes.  I will see you next year express auto description for my renewal. Keep up the good work!< /Review></record>

<Text>Gentleman who assisted me with renewing my expired license plates was VERY knowledgeable and friendly to my 3 yr old daughter and I for the 10-15 minutes I was there.
I waited maybe 2 minutes for the previous Customer to finish up. It was DEFINITELY worth their fee to
1) renew license plates on a SATURDAY morning
And
2) have a friendly person on the other side of the desk that ACTUALLY pays attention to me when I talk.
I SHALL go back next time I need to renew another car's license plate!<//Text>< pics>

Went to the DMV and there was about a 3 hour wait...called express and a friendly gentleman said there was no wait so I left DMV and dropped in....I was in and out in 30 minutes. Very convenient and quick, gentleman was very friendly and helpful. Well worth the extra $65 to not have to deal with DMV.<//Review>

Arrived there at 0945, and doors were closed; called them and they said they were in break (mind you, they open at 0900). They said they would be back in 30 minutes... waited like a fool. 45 minutes later they said they were 5 minutes away. Unbelievable. Ridiculous. Will never use their service; ended up going to Umi Smog & Registration which was 1 minute away. Only clicked one star because otherwise, system won’t allow you to leave a review.<//Text>

I just bought another car and I previously had sent my sister in law to this office because I saw the reviews. She told me how fast and professional they were with her that I went to check up myself. Gee they are the best! I was there for only 7 minutes and came out with my new registration. That Jeliani guy is THE MAN! I recomend it 100%<//review>

<review>Just left this place and it was the greatest DMV experience I've ever had. I walk in with no appointment and no lines. I transfer my car registration from AZ to CA, and the Gentleman at the desk was polite and kind… Ucash helped me finish my registration stuff. I got all my Registration paper and my Tag on the spot in about 15 min. Just come to this DMV by San Diego State. University and College. Thank you Ucash.</review>< Date>

This office saved me a trip to the DMV when I bought a car.  They did all of the transfer of title, fees, registration, etc.  What a huge relief because I was buying the car from someone who had inherited it from their dad. After much Googling and trying to navigate the DMV service i found Express Auto Registration. The staff was so helpful and provided all services i need it and was very efficient. Thank you Express Auto Registration.< /Text>

Literally closed, the note on the door talked about Memorial Day, not the Saturday before; showed up an hour before listed times and door closed, no one answered knock. Went to The Tag Shop based on a review 2 weeks ago and they were open.< /Text>

<Text>No one likes dealing with the DMV. Moving from out of state I made an appointment with express auto, parked my car, had a seat and a before I knew it not only was it done, the plates had been swapped in my car, the paperwork done , and I was legally in California, car and all. I was amazed. Thank you 100% times.<//Text>< gmapID>

Edit: I left an amazing review for this place initially. After 3 more visits, I’m not sure I’m coming back.

Our first visit was amazing. Who I presume is the owner (an Asian man) was extremely kind and helpful. It was 12:30am and he made us the best Thai Tea we’ve ever had. He made us feel welcome and relaxed. That’s why I wrote a good review.

Our second visit was awful. My husband and I went to get Thai Tea from here at 12:00am. One of the workers (a Hispanic male) refused to serve us Thai Tea and told us they stopped serving any drinks at 6:00pm.

Our third visit was OK. A lady served us and we ordered Thai Tea. We asked and she said they never stop serving drinks.

We visited a final time tonight. At around 12:30am, we went to Super Star Donuts. The same worker from my second visit was there. He was in the back making donuts and his mask was on his chin. One of his colleagues stopped making donuts and came out to serve us. He DID NOT have on a mask, even while making the donuts. That’s when I left and went to Winchell’s instead.

Masks are mandatory in store. There’s a sign on the door. So why are these employees (who are breathing on my food) not wearing masks?

I won’t be returning. It’s such a shame because their Thai Tea is delicious, but I value my ability to breathe more than donuts.< /text>

I have been in Fontana since 1991, and would always buy donuts here, I stopped buying a few months ago, last Tuesday I bought a half of dozen and all of their donuts taste really bad, they have a really nasty aftertaste of "old oil" and heavy, not light and soft as before, I called the shop this morning and a lady with a heavy accent answered, I asked for the owner and she replied that the owner is not in, and she ask me what do I need to talk to the owner for?, I asked her who she is, and she answered just a worker,  then I asked her again and she claimed to be the manager, I told her my concern about the donuts tasting bad and that it might be that the oil they fry the donuts in may be too old, she got angry and hanged up. Really? that is how you handle your business with customers? customers are you paycheck, no customers no paycheck.</Text>

The croissants are delicious and often sold out before 7AM.

The coffee is great too. It's the epitome of doughnut house coffee.

Prices are good too.<//review>

<review>Pizza was good, but the wings were pretty generic. They tasted like store bought frozen wings and were actually kind of cold in the centers.. And they drenched it with so much sauce I could barely even see the wings. Maybe that's why my 6 piece wings only had 5 wings in it.</review><Time>1575940826763<//Time><resp>{'time': 1576613929315, 'text': "Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us.

I think it's the best pizza in town cause it's not more dough than toppings, but they could add a lil more toppings. Over all reminded me of a place called "paddingtons pizza" in Oregon that is the best place that has pizza.<//review>

I love love their veggie/combo pizza, my girlfriend loves the All Meat classic and their garlic cheesy breadsticks are delicious. I mostly come to this location for carry-out as I don't really like to eat in here as it's mostly small tables and only a couple of booths. But the pizza is great.< /Text>< pics>

<text>I absolutely LOVE me n eds!! The list of topping choices is impressive, my personal favorites being the artichokes and fresh mushrooms! The crust is AMAAAAZZZZING!  Wings and wedges are delicious, salad bar is offered and your choice of fountain drinks or a nice cold beer.
The restaurant id ALWAYS clean, and Ive never had any issues with accuracy of my order. I must say, I have been to on weekends and the staff at times seem overwhelmed, but in all fairness, service and quality has never bren compromised even when super busy on a Saturday.
You will not be disappointed!< /text>< pics>

< Review>
Worst customer service ever. The lady (manager I'm guessing) was extremely rude. Made me wait like 15 minutes just to tell me they stopped serving beer. Wanted chicken and they told me that they ran out. So I ordered a pizza and when I tried to pay they said they dont except cash because they didnt have any change. So 25 minutes wasted time just to find out that there wasnt a damn thing they could do. I was Clearly frustrated and the only thing the manager had to say was "get the f&%k over or dont come back". Needless to say 10 years I been going there and they lost my business.<//Review>

Me and my family love Me n Eds.Always order from the panama location. We always do delivery and Last few times(3) they have been either forgetting something we ordered or pizza was done wrong. Today I got on to write this review because we have called and been nice about it to tell them they messed up on the pizza or forgot something. But this time I'm upset . The driver is always cool. When we call to tell them they blame it on the drivers like if the drivers made the pizza .<//text>

I gave two stars for today's visit due to the awful customer service. The manager was extremely rude. I ordered a thick crust pizza and received the regular crust. When I told the girl at the front she denied my claims. My friend ordered a thick crust as well, and I compared the two so she could see they were different. Didn't matter. Overall, a disappointing dining experience<//text>

<text>We placed an order over the phone to eat there and when we got the pizza it was not what we asked for. Had to eat it because I was on my lunch hour, didn't have time for them to remake. Sad because my wife had to pick off the onion and mushrooms which we didn't ask for.< /text><user>106283639924663038210<//user>< response>

Very disappointed. I wish I would've checked our pizzas before leaving. There was hardly any sauce and barley half the pizza even had cheese on it. We got there 2 large for $25, a pep & pep with black olive. There was that at least but VERY DRY & what'sa pizza with no cheese. I feel like we got robbed.<//Text>

<review>Let's start with my bias, I like Me-N-Ed's pizza and eat there whenever I can.
Tonight I ordered delivery and then  changed the order at the last second because not everybody wanted what I wanted.  Josh and the people there went out of their way to make sure I got the pizzas we wanted.  The pizzas just arrived, on time and taste great!
I'm happy, the family is happy, Thank You Me-N-Eds!</review><gmap_id>0x80ea401bb5a17a29:0x14d68ea3f54222e5<//gmap_id><rating>4< /rating><name>Will Risenhoover</name></record>

All other types of dressing is available at the salad bar.  The pizza was good as well as the potatoes, but I do like more ranch dressing on my large salad than the 2small containers they give you (I also like to sprinkle jalapeños on my salad) but I don't want to end up paying the cost of a pizza for it.  Hopefully you are a thousand island  or bleu cheese type!  Pizza was good<//Review>< Pics>

My family's favorite pizza place in town. It isn't brilliant, but it is consistently good, cooked properly, the crust is yeast-y and crisp, and the pepperoni isn't too oily.< /review>

Great food, big tvs. Nice arcade games. They should get morw arcade games to make it an ultimate arcade fun zone like johns incredible pizza. It would make the company better because the pizza has such great quality and flavor while johns incredible pizza taste like cardbord.<//Text>

<text>Worst service of a life time! Came in after trick or treating and they made it very clear that they did not want to serve us. They didn't let us sit in the back with a party of 17. They were short and rude and made us feel unwelcome especially the cashier by the name of Michael, a younger kid with a chip on his shoulder. I will NEVER RETURN. His manager will hear from us. If you're considering this place, don't waste your time.< /text><response>None</response>< rate>

<text>Who charges for ranch dressing?!? - we went in last Thursday. I ordered 3 pizzas,  2 orders of Buffalo wings and 1 order of potato wedges.  We got our order,  ok,  so where's the side of ranch? Maybe it's petty but to charge for ranch even with a $70 order to me is ridiculous,  side note the dough on their thin crust was hard.. won't go there again.... truly disappointed.<//text>< Pics>

<review>Very rude as soon as we came in the door the cashier informed us at 8:07 that they closed at 9:00 and the pizza took 15 minutes to cook. Also said everybody has to be out of the building by 9:00. You could tell they just didn't want to wait on customers. So we left. Won't give them my business anymore. Clearly these people don't want to work.<//review><rate>1</rate>< Date>

We are sorry to hear you are not a fan of our style pizza and we can definitely say we do not make east coast style pizza but that is what makes us unique here in California.  When it comes to the our boxes saying that we are "award-winning" that is the absolute truth and we are very proud of the accolades we have received over the 60+ years that we have been in business as most of the awards are People\'s Choice.  That means our guests voted for us which is such an honor.  Thanks again for stopping in and have a great day!'}<//response>

First time there and the last too. I didn't care for the taste of the pizza and the price is ridiculous for the size of their nasty pizzas. The salad bar was good though, but I wont ever go back. =\< /Text>

The pizza was ok but we were sitting there for about 20 minutes & noticed that people who got there  after us had come & gone with their food so my sister went & asked them if it was ready & noticed that it was sitting on the counter getting cold. She asked the manage about it & he said called us which he didn't. He didn't call anyone & there were maybe 7 or 8 other people in there so we would have heard him.< /text>

We also offer a gluten-free crust so if you decide to give us another shot, you may want to try the GF crust option instead.  Thank you for your review and we do hope we see you again!"}< /response>

< Review>
Horrible customer service. I placed my order on their website and input my credit card information in return was given a order confirmation. When they finally arrived they said I need to pay and he said he's never heard of anyone paying online? Really? Anyway rant over, customers lost.</Review>

A perfect and magnificent bike/hike trail. Just beautiful and full of everything u want. I saw many families with children, couples hanging out, friends mountain biking and on and on. You will not go wrong. Go and have fun.<//text>

This hike was pretty great. Super easy for beginners. Water was refreshing and cold. Theirs multiple little trails on this one which I thought was pretty cool. Exploring at its finest. Getting down to the waterfall was very steep so be careful. Theirs picnic tables by the waterfall great for lunch. Free parking!<//text>

Parking was pretty full on a Monday, so I can only imagine what it would be like on the weekend. Get there early. Nearly the whole trail is exposed so wear sun protection.</text>< Pics>

The Paradise Falls loop trail is a 4.1 mile hike. Id suggest going counter clockwise towards Lizard Rock, which has nice views. The trail will then take you down along the creek leading up to the falls. Do yourself a favor and take the Indian Cave trail back towards the parking lot. You can climb through if you crouch.< /Review>

The trail then drops down steeply into an area of volcanic rock with a spectacular 70 foot waterfall plunging into a large pool. The return leg of the loop is an easy meandering trail along the banks of Indian creek, with a number of lovely picnic spots along the way. You will be surprised that there is such a nice setting amongst the suburban sprawl.
Beautiful,relaxing place.</review>< pictures>

Great hike to do with kids. Fairly easy. If your not a fan of steep hills it might not be for you. Alot of fun.</Text>

Paradise falls is only one of the hidden gems provided in this beautiful Wildwood Regional Park. There so many hiking trails here and the views are amazing. My friend and I did Paradise Falls trail and Lizard Rock trail(this one was very steep and many inclines) definitely a cardio challenge indeed.  The only downside would be many hikers not wearing their mask.</Text>

<review>Trail starts out wide, from a large parking lot. Its maybe 2 miles roundtrip, being mostly downhill on the way there and uphill on the way out. The view is best if you cross the stream. There are picnic benches down by the falls and you can take an alternative route back...reconnecting the trail at the teepee on the top of the hill.< /review>< UserId.>

<review>This hiking trail always has beautiful views! I went the day after it rained and there was so much water. Although the water did not look clean... That makes me wonder if the sewage from nearby homes is being dumped here. Wear a mask as a form of respect to humanity. I’d say 70% of the hikers were not wearing one and then look at you funny like you’re the weird one. The parking lot is closed and must park at the local park nearby according to the city signs. Beware that you may not find parking because I did not find any parking on a Saturday afternoon. I had to park on the residential streets even though it is forbidden to do so. There is ample of parking on these streets. Happy hiking! 😊</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<text>Paradise falls was very beautiful, I loved the scenery. Hiking trails were nice and pretty easy. The one thing I liked about this hike was that it has all signs of the trails and directions of trails, the waterfall was beautiful, the water streams were nice, there were lots of picnic tables. Favorite part was the waterfall and Indian cave, make sure to go inside the Indian cave to continue the trail.</text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPKwcJm6Gj_TI_ZFto9v4cJ_ZP-URSCuRyZqDY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM83s8lej4MeW_etxNFWE1OPCti8G0pF506TKw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxvKEGVMHmE_eUi33-NtC6wUL_x22thK7BKUY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoPume3ov8i0jjhKvhk238DEdQH1WjIkBOjLw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjAJOqpzjOQLm5cfGin1FF7Nhf-UqSd_lWFhQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXNvWcKY42YVDCMkJVeynaPsaebBaa36De_V8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures>< Response>

Great place to take a hike with hidden treasures like Paradise falls.  Plenty of wildflowers along the paths at different seasons are a nice treat. There are a ride choice of trails to take with hikes as long or short as you like. The parking is limited and there are hours that are enforced and the gates will be locked.< /text>

This hiking trail always has beautiful views! I went the day after it rained and there was so much water. Although the water did not look clean... That makes me wonder if the sewage from nearby homes is being dumped here. Wear a mask as a form of respect to humanity. I’d say 70% of the hikers were not wearing one and then look at you funny like you’re the weird one. The parking lot is closed and must park at the local park nearby according to the city signs. Beware that you may not find parking because I did not find any parking on a Saturday afternoon. I had to park on the residential streets even though it is forbidden to do so. There is ample of parking on these streets. Happy hiking! 😊</text>

Easy hike to falls but give yourself a challenge and hike up to Lizard Rock.  4.6 mile loop from the falls to rock then back to parking lot.<//Review>

<Review>I was a bit let down that you can't swim in the falls because it's contaminated with pesticides from run off water. Other than that, the walk from the parking lot to the falls is a short one (a bit over a mile) and the park offers a descent hike to lizard rock. Parking is free.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x80e830f715c78d0d:0x83a3768f2d292691< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful open space to visit with many streams and exquisite natural beauty. Incredible Vistas and colorful wild Mustard covering hillsides in a golden color. The plants are over 6 feet tall. The variety of trails leading to the falls vary from easy to difficult. The falls are incredible this year. Look for mallard ducks and frogs.</review>

This is a popular and awesome hike for my two children. We can make it to the falls and back without issue. Lots of people, though, so be prepared for bad parking. Bring lots of water in the summer months!< /text>

One of the best parks to visit.  It is a true miracle hidden among the mountains.  It's always full of people.  Water is crystalline and cold.  When it comes to the waterfall, it is no longer to be removed.  The waterfall has a refreshing coolness that you do not feel in any other place.  Very convenient place to go with family.  The air is very clean and fresh.  Within the park there are places to relax until you reach the waterfalls.</Review>

Very nice hike in a semi-arid canyon setting. Can get quite warm, but there are drinking fountains available. Waterfall was running even during an extended dry spell. Easy walk to the falls, but a bit of a steep walk back out.  Recommend< /text>

Done this hike millions of times even before living in the air. People seem to just know about this place somehow. The Indian structures bring broad appeal and the caves are also a treat to see. The water seems so tempting to swim in but as everyone loves to repeat to you is that it is sewage runoff... Doesn’t change the beauty one bit!! It is very dusty around here driving your car off road. A nice hike</review>

Good hike, long stretches of land with inclines. Not a massive cave, but you can climb through it and the waterfall is nice.< /text>

<text>Great place, but I believe in the water is some Urban runoff. Smells a little bit like sewage, otherwise great little waterfall, highly recommend. Great shade for picnics as well< /text>< Time>

Easy trail to the Paradise Falls. It has water almost all year round and a family of ducks living in the water area. You can also connect the trail to Lizard Rock and back to parking lot to make it into a 5 mile loop.</text>

Easy hike to falls but give yourself a challenge and hike up to Lizard Rock.  4.6 mile loop from the falls to rock then back to parking lot.<//Review>

<Review>The place is pretty.  A lot of people, and the water kinda smelled.  Made we wonder why people would swim in it, even though the signs say not to, and there are manhole covers that say "sewer" along a good part of the stream.</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMLQLcVus1Eo8XCayQnb48WY6u6-NL2Wu71o_h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPIszCjhKkIb-OX2oZCI1BJ3S3lhcNJlKmttDt9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8FDFQydeEtRIe5u-gehi7ClS5hOpTfGycAJSs=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< response>

<review>I really like this park.  Lots of room on well maintained trails.  The only thing I have bad to say is that water does smell a bit weird.  Definitely not a swimming hole.  I've only hiked part of it but would like to hike more of it.< /review>< Response>

Went over to see the waterfall and the teepee. It did not disappoint even though it clearly states do not swim in the water, people still jump in and I don't blame them lol its a nice place to relax and listen to the water fall once your down there.</Text>< time>

< Review>
Loved this peaceful place.
It’s not a very big place and it can et very crowded close to the waterfall but it totally worth it.
You can picnic in the area, probably somewhere a little farther away from the waterfall.
It’s good for an easy hiking day!
It’s easy for kids too.

<text>Nice short hike to the falls. A little steep if you take a jogging stroller like we did. Nice wide path to the trailhead for the falls where the path gets kinda narrow. It is also nicely maintained with and has several sets stairs that get you all the way down to the water.</text><Rating>5<//Rating><userid>118356338221575680857</userid>< pics>

Hiking, falls, swimming hole, cave and a tee-pee, all makes for some fun exploring.< /text>

Year round flow in Southern California complete with Loon Ducks. It is a treat to see in this area. Nice short hike from Wildwood park in Thousand Oaks or a little longer hike from Santa Rosa Hill Canyon Trail head. With Reflection in water - Paradise Falls look like a flying Albatross - Just amazing!<//Text>

This is a pretty easy dog friendly hike. The elevation changes are pretty significant, but nothing too challenging for a beginner. There were a few water fountains along the trail and even public restrooms a little ways past the falls.< /Review>

I walked past paradise falls all the way up to lizard rock and back home. Paradise falls is the most interesting place in wildwood park, but in my opinion there are many places that are more beautiful and you can sit and contemplate your naval in peace and quiet with restrooms and water fountains nearby.<//review>< resp>

< Review>
Nice trail in the burbs, I have never seen so much water at the falls. It was a little muddy and the second creak crossing was not passable since the bridge was out. Parking was closed so I parked down the street at the park, don't park in the streets, I saw a cop giving tickets when I left.</Review>

Beautiful hike and waterfall. Not too kid friendly due to lack of area to hang out at the falls but easy to access from the parking lot.
We did a quick loop...hit the falls, Indian caves and teepee all in under 3 hours.< /Text>

Different trails to explore. Scenic views with a decent size waterfall. Too many people around the waterfall but come in the early morning.
Short hike to the water fall about a mile. Easy hike.< /Review>

Love hiking here, it's so beautiful, though walking back up from the falls is definitely a good workout!< /Text>

One of my favorite hikes to do with my family! Although i wouldn't take a stroller if you plan on going down to the waterfall. The trail gets a lottle narrow.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>Paradise Falls is beautiful! It's a romantic spot. But it's also a spot where a person can just sit and rest. It's a little hard to get to if you are old, like me. I am 58 and it took me 45 minutes each way. Be sure to wear hiking shoes, not sneakers or sandals. The path is VERY slippery! And even so, be prepared to get your feet soaking wet. It's safe. There's no crime in the area. So you can go when it's dark. But it's a pleasant trek and a beautiful spot! I strongly recommend visiting this spot, preferably with a picnic basket if you have a couple of hours to spare.< /Text>< pictures>

Great place for a hike, whether on your own or with friends and loved ones! Lots of trails, a cool little cave, and a lovely creek with a beautiful waterfall make this a place not to be missed! It even has an area for picnics and benches in a couple of unexpected locations. Highly recommended!< /text>

Good for a short hike. Has long flat trails with some short elevations. It was cool to see a waterfall at the end. We stretched the hike to include the lizard rock. It was amazing. Very long hike and mostly uphill. The rock is at the top and just before reaching you can take the trail back to the parking area. Awesome to spend weekend mornings.<//review>

Such a great hike. We took our time and spent about 2 - 2.5 hours doing the loop. I recommend starting early in the morning if it's going to be hot that day. Plus it starts to get busy closer to the afternoon.< /text>

<review>Dog friendy, awesome hike in the morning.  Waterfall was a surprise, the reason I say is that it hardly rains here and seeing  the waterfall was great. Especially nice when it is foggy in the morning.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzjT_qtijqCyO0iJAz3JJg9krlmpfwAoy0uAKm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMz39tOXdNuq8yOSdB875IKGxlpqKFgoCEZpuuj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPRJ8793gqv2P8I1YTUrJBC6FiTbm25ZTCo54Qj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

Beautiful hicking trail hidden in the middle of the mountain. To get here you have so many other trails that connects to this trail and  can make the experience more intense. You can go back and forth in 2 miles or add a couple more trails and make this a 6.5 miles trail. Make sure to plan your trail ahead of time and I guarantee it is going to be a lot of fun.<//text>

Easy hike to an urban waterfall!!
There are two (primary) ways to get to the falls. Most people usually enter the park from Avenida De Los Arboles. But there's a 'secret' entrance from the downstream side of the park. From Santa Rosa Valley, which is basically E. Camarillo, you take Santa Rosa Road to Hill Canyon Road. Passing through a gate after the Hill Canyon trailhead parking lot, the road becomes Hill Canyon Fire Road. You just follow it for about a mile. You dead end at the Hill Canyon wastewater treatment facility and the trailhead to the falls. It's exactly one mile along the bottom of the canyon, along the North Fork of Arroyo Conejo creek. There are four small bridges to cross and a restroom facility at the Oak Grove picnic area...</text>

Nice hike to a really great waterfall.  It's an easy hike, our 9 year old had no problem making it the entire way. We packed lunches and had lunch at the falls.  There is also a covered place to stop along the way, the tee pee, where you can get out of the sun on a hot day. We've done the hike multiple times and the kids love it.< /Text>

What a great adventure for mother's day!! My boys and me enjoyed it very very much! The scenery is absolutely breathtaking and the waterfall is magical. I wish the water was a little cleaner to swim in it, but my boys still played on the creek beside it. If you want nature, you will be in bliss here. Love it!!<//review>

<Review>This is a Moderate trail. A short almost 3 mile to 4 mile round-trip depending on what route you take. Very scenic. The natural vegetation, the trees and flowers that fill up the place, countless birds and butterflies all for a treat to your eyes.You will not believe your eyes that there is a waterfall right in the middle of a suburb. A lot of families, come here to enjoy the quietness and beauty that nature has to offer<//Review>< rating>

Absolutely love this place. Beautiful moderate hike which definitely ends with a great payoff. I'd recommend this hike to anyone. I do believe it is closed down currently due to the fires which were located right next to the trail but have not been so I can't say for sure that it's closed.< /review>

Paradise falls are very nice, the access is fairly easy and to reach the falls the trail is not that hard.
Just remember to bring plenty of water, a hat and sunblock, it feels very dry alone the way and there are not that many trees to get shade.
Half way to the falls there is a teepee and a water fountain to refill.<//review>

Really cool spot to hike to. It's not a far hike nor a particularly strenuous hike. We made it with a stroller though at some parts it is certainly not recommended to take a stroller. You can't swim in the water, but it is a beautiful little spot with some fun rocks for exploring for kids or adults.</Review>

******Do not go swimming here***** The water is runoff from the streets on its way to the treatment plant a mile away. Imagine swimming in the Los Angeles River. Wonderful to look at and the only area in Wildwood you cant see houses and roads. It is a moderate and mostly flat trail to get here. The end is a hike downhill. You would not expect a waterfall to be here when you park at the trail head next to cacti.< /text>

<Review>Cool hiking destination through Wildwood, cooler here than on the trails. You really shouldn't swim in the water, but climbing up a rock wall to a little grotto behind the water fall is pretty neat. Fun place to explore and cool off.<//Review>< resp>

A beautiful waterfall somehow still alive in the dry Southern California.

Its very small and weak compared to other, wetter areas; but for its location, its five stars! Best and biggest waterfall I’ve seen on any nearby hike.<//Text>

It's a fun hiking experience, and it's family-friendly! Just be sure to wear good shoes because most of the hike to the falls is down hill and it's likely you could get your feet wet if you're not careful when you want to go to the other side of the falls.< /text>

First time hiking there. Nice and cute , short and easy hiking,  doable for little ones.  There's a small stream going down the falls with wild ducks there,  and lots of picturesque spots with the falls view from the rocks.</Text>

Not a very pretty hike, most of it was spent on a dusty dirt road (not ideal on a hot, cloudless day) and when we got to the falls it was PACKED. Many people not wearing masks.</review>

Walking to the waterfall and back is a great way to get some exercise. The trail is easy to walk but has a significant elevation change. To the waterfall and back to the parking lot is about 2 miles. Parking lot has ample parking.< /review>

Great hiking spot - who knew there was a waterfall in the middle of Thousand Oaks?! Easy enough for beginners and with its many trails, difficult enough for experienced hikers. Lots of mountain bikers cruising around as well. Beautiful area and fun for the whole family!</Text>

Everyone wondering how the waterfall runs year round.  Well it is water from the wastewater plant that is nearby.  It is safe as it has been treated before entering the stream. But still wouldn't swim in it like I have seen people doing many times.<//text>

Family and dog friendly hiking trails with a waterfall.  Most of the trails could accommodate a stroller but near the waterfall there are stairs down to the water and a narrow path up to view the falls above.  There are water fountains for drinking near​ the falls and there are bathrooms at the nature center.  There is also an Indian cave you can climb stairs to reach.<//Review>

There are a number of ways to get to the falls and you can also stop by the Lizard Rock and the teepee that's why it's never boring... There's also plenty of parking so don't have to worry about your car being towed. 😂< /review>

Nice area, good views, and you can get a nice workout on the trails. It can get really busy, and parking can be a pain. I recommend going early to beat crowds.</text>

<review>A nice easy hike perfect for the whole family, Fido included. The hike is an easy loop and there are plenty of signs letting you know which way to go. There are three different sites, besides the gorgeous views, to see while on the hike. First there is a giant tepee where you can rest and debate exactly what it was made for. Next is the Paradise “Falls” and the quotations are there because it was more of a water spout than a waterfall, but CA is in a major drought and maybe I just wasn’t able to see it in its full glory. You don’t want to go in the water because it’s actually a runoff from the street and you can even see the oil resting on top of the water. However some filter on Instagram can fix that right up for you. Finally there’s the “cave” and again the quotations are there because it more of a dimple then a cave. There is a little hole to crawl through to get on top of the cave, but coming back down is really steep. The whole hike took about 1.5 hours and most of it is in direct sunlight so bring plenty of fluids and lots of sunscreen.<//review><user_name>Nyssa Buck< /user_name>< Pictures>

This waterfall seems to run all year round. It's not too long a hike to get there. You don't even need to pack a lunch. Just some water and you will be ok. This is a short hike to a really beautiful waterfall. Don't go in the water because it's not clean. But dipping your feet in for a good photo won't kill you. This and Eaton Canyon are the best waterfalls in Socal.</Text>

This is a fairly easy hike to an actual waterfall, right here in Thousand Oaks.  The scenery is lovely and the trails are wide and well marked. There are a number of inclines - but we saw many children with families easily tackle these hills. (Not recommended for the elderly). In addition to the waterfall there is a giant Tipi and a Cave that the youngsters will love. The waterfall area is always crowded with young adults playing loud music, but if you press on West past the falls (along the creek) you will find a lovely, large, wooded picnic area - with quaint foot bridges, and even an indoor restroom! Tip: fountain at the Tipi is ideal for refilling your water bottles.<//Text>

17 June 2016 This was a fun hike for me mainly cause I'm not a fan of hiking. I had a bad experience before and was scared to do this but it was worth it. We did see the water fall its not pouring down like in the picture but it's enough that you wont be upset you did the hike. But i must say please be ready for all the little gnats that will fly around you the closer you get to water. They were quite annoying. We did see a bathroom but a park ranger has to open it at least for us it was locked so I would recommend to use the bathroom before you come for just in case matters. We will be doing this hike again tomorrow i read someone else's comment on the incline and depending on the trail you choose yes that incline will get you. Other than that bring a backpack and water and enjoy.  = )< /text>

The parking lot was near full at around 5:00pm but I was able to find parking. At the parking lot there is also a port-a-potty bathroom if you think you need to unload before the hike.

I spent about 2 minutes in front of the billboard trying to memorize the trail and the turns I needed to take to get to Paradise Falls but in hindsight, this was unnecessary. The trails are really well marked, not to mention this is such a popular trail that there is bound to be someone to ask if you feel you're lost. In addition, there seems to be cell signal (Verizon) all throughout.

I did hear some rangers talking about snakes but I didn't see any on the trail that day, probably again because it's so populated that if there were any snakes around at the beginning of they day, they probably moved away from the trail.

About half way through there is a drinking fountain where the giant teepee is and I think there is also a fountain right near Paradise Falls. If you're cool with drinking from these do yourself an additional favor by leaving the water bottle behind.

This is also a popular area for people with drones so if you don't like that, you've been warned.</Text>

(Translated by Google) A good place to walk. You can also bathe in the river but it is a little below the waterfalls near the village, there are places to bathe in the river

(Translated by Google) Superb walk.
In the middle of the far-wesr, without the Indians, but with many beautiful landscapes.
Montage, flower, cactus, trees, butterflies, animals, mountain lion, spiders, in short ... a great time to share.
It is 1 hour walk from the parking lot to the river, but the show deserves
Trust me, you can go there !!!

(Original)
Superbe balade.
En pleinndans le far-wesr, sans les indiens, mais avec beaucoup de beau paysages.
Montage, fleur, cactus, arbres, papillons, animaux, lion des montagnes, araignées, bref... un super moment a partager.
Il fait prevoir 1 heures de marches du parking a la rivière, mais le spectacle le mérite
Faites moi confiance , vous pouvez y aller!!!</Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) A national park located about 2 hours drive from the center of Los Angeles.
You can worship the scenery that appears in the western drama.

<Review>(Translated by Google) The waterfall is beautiful. But dirty water due to mud and algae. Ban on swimming. But at the same time a great place as a hiking goal. Reach the shade and source of water in the heat!

(Original)
Водопад красивый. Но грязная вода из-за тины и водорослей. Запрет на купание. Но при этом отличное место в качестве цели хайкинга. Дойти до тени и источника воды в жару!< /Review>< Rate>

<Date>1532463073489< /Date><resp>None<//resp><review>(Translated by Google) If you do a tour on the west coast of the USA, this small but beautiful waterfall should not be missing. Warning: only suitable for tourists who can still walk uphill and down stairs. Can only be reached by foot. As a result, classic mass tourism is not to be found here.
Please plan a 25-minute walk. No entry and free parking. Furthermore, I can't just warn anyone going it alone ... there are very, very large coyotes here. Although there were four of us, someone always sneaked about 10 meters away.
But the local ranger also warns against going it alone. Rattlesnakes, poisonous plants and whatever else a steppe valley has to offer. Be sure to read the notice board at the park entrance.

(Original)
Wenn Ihr eine Tour an der Westküste der USA macht, sollte dieser kleine aber wunderschöne Wasserfall nicht fehlen. Achtung: Nur für Touristen geeignet, die noch Steigungen und Treppen gehen können. Ist nur per Fuß zu erreichen. Dadurch ist hier nicht der klassische Massentourismus anzutreffen.
Plant bitte 25 Minuten Fußweg ein. Kein Eintritt und freie Parkplätze. Weiterhin kann ich keine Alleingänge nur warnen...es gibt hier sehr, sehr große Cojoten. Obwohl wir zu viert waren schlich immer einer ca 10 Meter uns.
Aber auch der örtliche Ranger warnt vor Alleingängen. Klapperschlangeln, giftige Pflanzen und was so ein Steppental halt noch so zu bieten hat. Auf jeden Fall Hinweistafel am Parkeingang lesen.</review>< Rating>
