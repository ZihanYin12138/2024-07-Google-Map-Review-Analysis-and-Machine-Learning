<Review>Everything looks amazing. The noodles are thick and creamy. The egdrop soup you see here is delicious and only 10.45.
All items start at 10.55 and go to about 15

Took my Sapporo girl here, she loved her white miso while I loved my spicy red miso. Naturally, miso broths won't be as creamy and pork fat flavorful as pork broths, so keep that in mind when trying the miso ramen.
Now, for both, generous slices of pork (not one like some cheap ramen shops), with enough noodles and broth to fill you up for lunch for about $10. Really hungry? $15 lunch special with the pork on rice, fried rice, gyoza, etc. Even though we were both hungry and didn't have breakfast, could only finish 75% of the fried rice + pork on rice bowls that came with our ramen.
But, this is not complaining. Fried rice is made well enough that you want to take it home for later, if you didn't already vacuum it up. Lunch special comes with teas, sodas, etc. Iced green tea was just the thing to balance out the spiciness of the red miso ramen (which isn't searing hot thankfully).
Definitely delicious, a place where you just keep eating and eating even if your mind is on something else, and before you know, it's gone! =D
Nice, comfortable spot away from the packed craziness of Sawtelle's ramen shops. Sufficient street parking at meters during the day (only 3, 4 parking spots to the side of the building free). Just remember - same building as the gym! Stay on Olympic and don't turn right (north) like Google Maps accidentally tells you. Service was prompt and attentive for the light crowd, maybe five guests at Thursday lunch.</Text>

<rate>4</rate><Review>Checked this place out (2017/6/10) after driving through Sawtelle on a crowded evening. I wasn't sure what to expect, but am quite glad to have stumbled upon this place!

What I got and what I thought:

Deluxe White Miso Ramen (2017/6/10)
- had a distinct and balanced broth flavor
- solid noodles that could absorb the soup flavor
- thick-cut pork slices that help counter the saltiness
- cabbage (along with the bamboo) help provide a variety of textures
* Something about this dish gives a soothing sense of hominess (beyond the typical ramen experience) and would entice me to come back on a monthly basis or so.

While my dining experience here was somewhat limited, I really enjoyed the food and the quiet atmosphere, and also appreciated the historic timeline of the restaurant mounted on the wall. I am looking forward to future visits to try out the rest of their menu!</Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5DnshF_vInoDq2hm4kB_Xp66H2Hwx48KE1FEO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOIng6AAsbssAXjn2cQ9XAWJ7ls4_0qRdE0mdTU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80c2bb0b7cd824b7:0x6ff9667b2de281f7<//GmapID></record>

Let me preface by saying this review isn't about how good the food is in general but how good it is compared to the other ramen places in the area. It's fairly priced. I used to live in Japan and have had a lot of ramen and I'll say it's the least best out of the 5 or so that I've tried around my apartment. But in general it's good food.< /text>

<Review>I enjoyed this place! It is a chain restaurant that started in Japan in 1963. Got the deluxe red miso ramen, which came with a soft boiled egg (cut in half) and three thick, delicious slices of pork.

Donsanko isn't just a second or third option type of ramen shop. I can see myself coming here even if Daikokuya weren't busy.<//Review>< Pictures>

Unfortunately, I have had instant ramen that was better tasting than this place.  I came here because of the good rating. Not sure why this place is getting so many good reviews.  Wow, I am still in shock at how bad this place is.  Sorry.< /Text>

The ramen is consistently good. I can't say its authentic, but it's tasty. Portions are decent. Most extras like egg and pork are considered side items that need to be ordered separately.

Service is always professional and efficient.

Best of all, we've never had a problem getting a seat!<//Text>

The parking is an issue here and there is no pickup parking spot if you are ordering carry out. I ordered two ramen bowls. Neither of us got the hard boiled egg that was supposed to come with the ramen and we were not given chopsticks with out order. The flavor was good but the issues with getting the food and with the order made it an unpleasant first impression of this place.<//Text>

Nice spot slightly away from the Sawtelle crowds when you just want ramen and a good side of gyoza and don’t want to wait, like forever. Friendly staff. Tasty and quick. Hits the spot.</Text>

SUPER delicious and authentic ramen. Might be the best kept secret near Sawtelle. The lines to every other place on the area were out the door so we decided to try this place and it did not disappoint!! The staff was so BEYOND friendly and the food was fab. Do yourself a favor and try the spicy fried rice as a side...YUM!!< /review>

<text>Tasty ramen, gyoza, and some sides. Really great value menu (ramen side and drink for about $15) and there are specials every day.  Service is very friendly. Not much decor and no alcohol but the food is delicious. Easily overlooked since little Osaka is near but worth checking out.<//text>< Pictures>

<text>We love this place! On our last trip we had the soy sauce and 50 year miso- both excellent. The 50 year had a good substantial broth with an extra helping of bean sprouts. The soy sauce ramen is our standard fare- the kids prefer it over any other ramen on Sawtelle. Staff are friendly. Will come back regularly!< /text>< Pics>

Delicious ramen (50 years Classic Ramen) Hokkaido style both noodles and the signature creamy broth cooked to a flavorful perfection, and the service is super polite and prompt as you would expect from an authentic Japanese establishment. We are definitely coming back.</review>

Great authentic taste,  wife is Japanese and loves it.   Good variety of Ramen aside from the too common shoyu and tonkatsu flavors.   The combos are a great deal and their fried rice is really tasty.</Text>

Food was not bad but the broth for the seafood Ramen was a little too thick, with too many vegetables and not enough seafood for my taste.  It also was not served until 10 minutes after all the other food at the table had arrived.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I got miso ramen. The soup is rich but not greasy, and the noodles are crunchy with crunchy noodles. The soup is also hot and full of vegetables. It was really delicious.
It is a ramen of Japanese taste.
The dessert apricot tofu was also delicious!

味噌ラーメンを頂きました。スープは濃厚ですが脂っこくなく、麺はちぢれ麺でツルッとしています。スープも熱々でお野菜たっぷり。本当に美味しく完食しました。
日本のほっとするお味のラーメンです。
デザートの杏仁豆腐も美味でした！<//Review><response>None</response>< username>

<Text>Great spot to get a quick haircut. I brought both of my kids (a toddler and a high schooler) and they came out great. It helps to have reservations with the gentlemen, to save on waiting time, but we were seen right after a couple people in front of us came in for their times.

We had regular cuts at $16 each. Cash only!< /Text><username>Jeanette Hernandez</username><Gmap_id>0x80c2cd225293ebef:0x44bae33ccb49f27<//Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp><time>1606594927260< /time></record>

Great Barbers and always obey their own hours unlike other barbershops. Only 17 for the service at the time of this posting which is still a bargain these days. Great service!</review>

<Rating>3< /Rating><text>Hello, my son in law recommended this place to my son, He mentioned that he went in and he said hello and none of the 2 guys and 2 ladies that were there responded back with a hello or a good morning, I think you guys should be more polite with your clientele, your Hispanics and all of the people that go to your shop are also Hispanics, you guys do a great job in cutting hair, but you need to be more professional with your customer service . It doesn’t hurt to say good morning, good evening, or a simple hello,to greet your customers. Don’t forget we give you business. Thank you.</text>< pictures>

Probably my favorite food place in the world. The BBQ chicken sandwich and salad is THE BEST... I've moved away from Santa Cruz but still think about it often. Owner Farouk is super nice and extremely funny!< /text>

Best Panino Sandwich that I ever had in any restaurant. The crunch on the bread was exquisite and the filling of each of the Panini was perfect. We had the classic clubhouse, artichoke, and caprese. All three were mind-boggling. I would recommend this restaurant and it's singular Focus on making the best of 1 item. So many fail by trying to be too diverse on their menu and everything is mediocre instead of having one fabulous food. The atmosphere in the restaurant with the soft background music and the masks on the wall and eclectic decor was perfect again. Try the dessert...We shared a Brownie Sundae... The owner presented the Brownie Sundae vertically in a goblet topped with whipped cream... which made it also unique... plus it was tasty.<//review>

My mom and I each ordered a half panino and half soup combo for lunch. They were absolutely delicious, with perfect crusty toasted bread and cheesy fillings. I got the caprese with pesto, mozzarella, and tomatoes, she got the artichoke hearts, mozzarella, and red pepper pesto. Her lentil soup was spicy, hearty, flavorful. I was so sad I couldn’t really eat any since I am allergic, but I snuck a tiny bite for flavor and paid with a mild allergic reaction (not recommended, but was worth it). I got the tomato soup, which was a nice side to the sandwich. There were several other interesting vegetarian sandwich options, and also a make your own grilled cheese section. I recommend coming here for a delicious filling lunch!

Decor is a bit creepy for me with some scary masks, felt a bit voodoo-esque, but perhaps that is the charm.  Dark, cozy, mysterious. I would not want to be trapped there at night.< /text>

<review>I really like the ambiance here, it's mellow, friendly, and made me feel like I was witnessing 20th century Paris. The paninis were food, tapenade was even better. I ordered the salami and pesto panini and, though it was good, the flavor palette seemed a bit too same-y, meaning I got bored of it before I got full. I recommend this spot nonetheless :)< /review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<review>My pressed sandwich was filling and delicious! The owner is present and friendly. The chef came out and gave us great recommendations & cooking tips. The free Wi-Fi is fast! The decor is kitchy & fun. It was dark & cool & welcoming on a hot afternoon.< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNorZgEc5C0N-jJafY98f_mGVovIXHcwxWeeJR-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< response>

A hidden gem in Santa Cruz. Delicious, and large paninis most for 10 to 12 dollars. Plenty of vegetarian options in a laid back old time cinema setting.<//Text>

This place is just weird. The paninis are ok, but it seems like the owner is just putting you through his strange decor choices and personal preferences, like his hatred for mayo (it says that and other weird stuff on the menu). You're making sandwiches for clients, not yourself...</Text>

I recently bought a car from a nearby dealership and they provided a free wash. Wash was at most mediocre though.. maybe because it was free? Not sure but could've definitely been a lot better..< /text>

Half a hour to wash car 3 hour wait to get car whipped down 1st time going there. Don't know if i'll return. Talked to a few regulars they don't know why it's taken so long not normally like this. I may check them out again when it have time to kill. In it 1233 sunday by receipt out at 445pm. I'm three blocks away.<//review>

There was no attendant at the front and took a while for anyone to acknowledge me. The attended I did pay took the cash straight to his wallet. The car wash barely has any pressure and even the rotating arms barely spin. Not worth the price at all.<//Text>

Stopped in on a rainy day and needed a thorough vacuum and the seats wiped down before heading out of town. They were very accommodating and offered just a vacuum and wiping seats down for a very good price - I was just so glad they were even open!< /Review>

I saw Skinpeccable Dermatology about seven months ago. I am so over-the-top happy with the results! I've been getting so many compliments from friends asking me what have I done and why I look so much younger... I feel so confident, not wearing make up. I never left the house without make up, even went to the gym with make up. Now I can leave the house not wearing any make up at all whatsoever and I feel beautiful!<//review>

Skinpeccable has been my go-to for all my skin concerns for over 10 years now. The clinician and medical staff are polite, gracious and caring. The vibe of the clinic is peaceful. I always feel like I’m in the best hands. They do great work and I recommend them wholeheartedly.< /Review>

<Text>This is a fantastic dermatologist. I have had several procedures, including: chemical peels, fractional laser treatments, and various filler injects. All to my satisfaction, for the most part. The staff are also fantastic,  and provide great customer service. Be prepared to park on the street, and pay the expensive meters; or simply take a ride-share.<//Text>< name>

I was very impressed with my treatment by Dr Darvish and his staff to remove stitches that Walter Reed National Medical Center has inserted after MOSH Surgery in the DC area.

I had had previous laser treatment 3 yrs ago by his staff and I was delighted to come back to him during this visit to Santa Monica.<//review>

<Response>None< /Response><text>I met with Doctor Raphael Darvish a week ago,  about some deep wrinkles that I had on my face. He discussed the options for me and thought that injecting filler to the areas would be best. I trusted his honesty with me and I had him do the procedure, where needed. I had no pain ,hardly any swelling and very little bruising. He is so gentle and took a lot of time with me, making sure he did everything perfect. It is now a week later and I am so pleased with the results. I definitely look younger and better.He did not make me look like a freak, which was my fear of having anything done. I have never trusted any other doctor, to do anything on my face, because I did not trust them. I would give Dr. Darvis 10 stars if this site would allow it.</text><user_name>joan Gardner<//user_name>< date>

Yesterday I went to see Dr. Darvish and I can highly recommend this clinic and doctor. I have so much respect for everyone at Skinpeccable. They are very welcoming, every person there is knowledgeable and friendly.
When it comes to injections Dr. Darvish is the one! Very light handed and quick. I love how he explains every step and makes you comfortable.
5+ stars for this clinic!

Thank you Skinpeccable and all you do!
You all will continue seeing me come back!<//text>

<review>I went to skinpeccable last week to have Dr. Raphael Darvish tell me what to do, to correct some deep wrinkles, that I had on my lower face. A friend told me to have fillers injected but I was afraid of the results. Dr. Darvish spent a lot of time explaining everything to me and I trusted what he said and had him do the filler procedure.
I had very little swelling and no pain during, or after the procedure.  I usually bruise easily, but there was
very little bruising. I love the results and I look so much younger. I feel
terrific and now it is a week later and I am no happy with how I look. I would never go anywhere else and because of his honesty and professional manner, I would trust anything he would suggest to improve my appearance. He is one of a kind and it is no wonder that his other reviews are all excellent. Nothing fake here, he really is terrific and knows what he is doing.<//review>< pictures>

I love, love, love Skinpeccable. They have been helping me take care of my skin for ten years. Dr. Dharvish is extremely professional, knowledgeable and listens to what you want and need. Kathy is amazing with the laser. The whole team is fantastic. The office in Brentwood is cute and clean and modern. I will never go anyplace else and I highly recommend them!<//text>

<Review>Absolutely amazing experience! Everyone is so sweet and considerate. Dr. Darvish is a master at his craft. I’ve had the fractionated skin resurfacing treatment done twice now and I can’t say it’s completely painless but I will say they go above and beyond to make you as comfortable as medically possible. If you’re looking for a dermatologist in the Brentwood area look no further!<//Review><rate>5<//rate></record>

Went to Skinpeccable in Brentwood for an ILP treatment. After going over the options with Kathy, the laser nurse, she administered the treatment accordingly. She was knowledgeable and made sure I was comfortable throughout the treatment. The office is clean and nicely decorated. Marcie at the front desk was super helpful. Highly recommend.<//review>

< Review>
Had a wonderful experience here with great results. I have been consistently receiving hair removal procedures over the past three years with Kathy at Skinpeccable.
Not only is Kathy the most lovely human being, I have had fantastic lasting results.
Hair removal can be pricy but at this location you will not waste your time or money. I have sought out deals via Groupon and have found that more often than not the lasers are out of date, weaker and the results are inferior and disappointing time after time.
The lasers at Skinpeccable are top quality and if you see Kathy she is exceptionally diligent which makes all the difference. I highly recommend this place, Five Stars *****< /Review>

<review>Friendly, informative and does a great job zapping away those imperfections with the latest high tech laser tools.They are always on time, you hardly have a chance to sit down in the waiting room before you're seen by a dr and the appointment takes no more than 10 min. It's pretty awesome.< /review>< Pics>

The office was clean and modern, the front desk staff were nice, and my doctor seemed to actually care about me. I couldn't really ask for more so I know where I will be getting my next yearly mole check up.</review>

This is a long overdue review as we've been going to Mr. Kebab for years! It's the only food my family, some of whom are on keto diet or low carb diet, can agree on. The owners are super friendly and flexible. I love the fact they started doing online orders recently...it makes things super convenient. I sometimes place an order then go to Safeway next door to shop for groceries then pop in at Mr. Kebab to pick up my to go order.

We always get the chicken kebab plate. It comes with salad, 4 chicken skewers, rice and house bread. The combo lamb and beef kofte kebab is also good. It's a lot of food...I always have leftovers for the next day. The meats are always juicy and tender. I'm so glad the combo plate comes with rice because it's soooo good. The salad is always fresh. My kids especially love their garlic fries.

In the years I've been coming to Mr. Kebab, the food has always been good. It's always met my expectations.<//Text>

Been going here for at least 5-6 months now, great food. Just found out today it's under new ownership and we met the owner. She is great, food still delicious! Heads up, they're working on changing everything online. We expressed that and owner was very patient & pointed us to the changes. Will continue to come here!< /text>

One of my favorite restaurants in the area! We usually get the chicken kebab, beef kebab, and babaganush ... So yummy ... Meat is tender and flavorful. Beef is slightly spicy. Comes with warm bread and no problem asking for more. Owner is super nice. Have never left behind any more when we eat here.</Text>

My favorite spot to eat! My personal favorites are the Buffalo Garlic Fries, as well as the Taco Tuesday Special Chicken Halal Tacos. The new Management is really professional and I will always be a long time customer! Hidden gem in the Heart of Union City. And the best part is that it’s HALAL! Mr Kebab is DELICIOUS!!

The falafel is very good. The vegetarian plate was a very small portion. They forgot to send the bread that supposed to come with the plate. It's not bad but not sure if it is worth it the drive.< /Text>

<review>Whoa!!!!  A small store front looking from outside in, but inside the restaurant was quite a bit of room.  Anyway, I had the sandwich with Chicken.  They grill and rotisserie as Mediterranean Meats are usually cooked.  Mr. Kabob serves Salads (with choice of meat), Kabob's of course, Gyros, Wraps and Sandwhiches called "Doner".  I had their Doner Chicken.

The Bread had some type of seeds cooked into it.  The bread is also very soft with air pockets when taking a bite reminded me of biting into a Marshmallow..  The Chicken was chopped and cooked with sauteed onion.  The Doner sandwhich was topped with Fresh chopped Romaine Lettuce, Tomato and onion and traditional Tzatziki Sauce.  The meal also came with a side salad.

It so happened that the Doner was a little messy than Chicken on a Gyros or a Wrap for that matter, that whatever pieces of Chicken fell on the plate, then used it to top the side Salad and make a Chicken Salad as a second meal.  Delicious!!!   I recommend Mr. Kabob, but will officially give a 4 Star rating because no Military or Veterans discount were recognized.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOD_gXTIAbDiFLKHup5HHbvjy_ixB0xLy9HkyEb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP9K4GA2AEWj9LQPXw5cabc-gSFOOMh5GL5TSSS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP17_I6xqHH8zFnkoHm6DCK0afsfPD8dE2ei6x0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFTrgGMxPY0fJlkUTEUkiEOUaD_s66Bnh4if25=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOvDmH5zS5K9KkBD97aV5XQOVOLJ6XPG98AVZ2a=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO7A3iXZ2xm3eMtHbnljlYtM4aHXSyWUvsin2Va=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN01KXujVRmvlQfIrA3xYtzrlHzmg18e9OI-X3h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnr_UOnvxr_D1q6orbTE_d9mFiC7LPNwu5pnqA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJfNuLO7CwXqWj5oa3y00QwUCU221LRRnlfNyb=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOVSwpXc1tTKzPjHKkOozflCbl8SHSLChj7yj4Z=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMXEMkX4dWjoMcPdHKlsmpX8WK4kAXcNkCNPfPg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOsfOScOFfSuRB0Ziddc_eizWNTKZmox8QUIhZZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None< /Response><GmapID>0x808f95618c447739:0xb35ef1111ebf6fec<//GmapID></record>

<Text>Food is good and tasty not overly great---2.75 Stars. The meat portions are small, but the prices are also reasonable and the quality is good. The ambience is similar to a nicer Subway. The service can be slow when busy and the staff is friendly. Had the sampler appetizer which I highly recommend as the hummus/tabouli/falafel/dolmas/salad are pretty authentic with good portion sizes. The chicken skewers were dry and very small, but the rice and salad were good. The lamb kebabs were super tiny--think the size of those red n white hard swirl free mints you pick up walking out of the restaurants, however they were tender and nicely seasoned. Would go back for lunch occasionally if craving this style food, but would not make a special trip unless I just happen to be in this area.< /Text></record>

<Review>We found this place online, and did not read their reviews. When we got there that was the picture they promise to serve you, and look what i got from second picture. I born and raised in Mediterranean culture, so Mr Kabob this is shame. Either change the picture of Iskender and put a picture of what you serve or close that shop. Sorry< /Review>< UserId.>

Food didn't took long to be ready only 10 min. Teastly food especially the bread. It is very expensive compared to what to get in the plate meat is very small pieces and rice not much.<//Text>

<Review>Close to Logan and the Union City  BART station, great food, great quality, and good service. Been going here for years and it has only gotten better. I usually recommend the chicken or lamb kebabs, but they also make a delicious gyros! This menu is a little pricey but worth every penny. (Also Halal!)< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>$9.00 lamb wrap

Pros:
Great tasting food

Cons:
The amount of meat is a joke.

It should be called a salad wrap with 4 thumb sized pieces of meat.

If i was paying $5 for this, I would understand, but this is a $9 wrap< /Review><Rating>2< /Rating><date>1544243042864<//date>< GmapID>

I always felt that the best kebab houses were in England. That was until I came across Mr. Kebab. 5 stars does not do this place any justice. Always fresh and delicious. I come here more than once a week...and I'm very picky about my food. Great service and food. If you haven't already been and tried this place then you owe it to yourself to do so. Best of Turkey is right here.<//Text>

I'm not sure I could ever get tired of the lamb kebabs. My wife loves the falafel. Great food, good portions. Best kebab place I've tried.< /Review>

<pictures>None</pictures><rate>4<//rate><Text>Visiting from out of town I stopped by Mr. Kebab for some lamb kebab.  The food was good and tasted fresh.  I must say that I was sick when I went so my palate wasn't in tip top shape.  Don't expect over the top Mediterranean flavor, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a bite in Union City.

Restaurant was very clean, staff was friendly.  Pricing was reasonable, I paid about $13 for lamb kebab, salad, rice, bread and a fountain drink.< /Text></record>

<text>I love Mr. Kebab! They have a true family vibe and their culture and love can easily be tasted within their food.
My favorite is the Chicken Kabab Plate; the chicken is very juicy and tender.
The mixture of the well seasoned food, lemon rice, Mediterranean salad and other sides all blend with ones pallet effortlessly!
I'm glad I live near by as I'm quickly becoming a regular!<//text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I haven't been to Mr. Kebab in a while. Mr. Kebab reminds me of my childhood! Brainchild, the children education tutoring center was right next to Mr. Kebab back in those good old days of 2003-2007ish. I forgot when that brainchild closed next door, but I remember buying the fries from that place in my elementary and middle school years. In high school, I got one of their plates of lamb kebab, and it was delicious. It's been a while, and I want to go back!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp></record></dataset><record>

<review>My boyfriend and I really like this place.  The food is GREAT!  We have noticed a change in their salad and I must say it's an improvement.  The previous salad wasn't bad but I like the new one better.  Everything we've had there has been very good.< /review>< Pictures>

Halal meat is served here.  Owners are known Muslims. Good variety of combo plates and wraps. I had the Lamb and chicken skewer combo. It was pretty good and came with rice, salad and bread. But I think it needs some kind of hummus or yogurt or some kind of sauce on the side. Also tried the Turkish tea which was good. Good amount of seating inside and friendly service.< /text>

Friendly, fast service.  Delicious food in generous portions.  I come here again and again,  and I'm never disappointed.  Best shawarma plates in the East Bay.  I don't say that lightly.  I'm very picky about my food.< /Review>

Absolutely wonderful food and great service.   The Kofte Kebabs were tender and flavorful and the falafel was on point.   Found this place close to my hotel while on a trip to CA.   If you're ever near Union City or heck San Fran for that matter, go check out the food here.<//Text>

<Review>I had the falafel plate and husband had the lamb kebab. Amazing hummus and falafel in my dish. The lamb kebab was also good. I feel the meat is generally overcooked in some places, but not here. But the baklava took the prize. Since my husband loves this dessert we get it in almost every Mediterranean restaurant we go to. This was by far the best one we've had.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x808f95618c447739:0xb35ef1111ebf6fec<//gmapID></record>

< Review>
Came in here starved so I ordered beef and chicken kebab combo and added extra beef kebabs. Now this was close to about $15. So we get the order and everything tastes great. but here's the small problem. The meat was as small as my thumbs! Seriously it looks like ordered a rice plate with mini kebabs! I could find more meat on a single wing! Regardless if it tasted good or not, I felt completely ripped off and I still had to eat after this because I ordered a adult meal not a kid's meal!
I've been to numerous kebab places and this is the first place that serves this puny little excuse for meat! What am i supposed to fill up with this? A 20lbs 1 year old?

No thanks, even though the owner was friendly and nice, for the price it's not worth it!</Review>

High quality and very tasty food. Staff is quick and attentive. I've had falafel wrap and the combo doner plate. You get a ton of food so watch out, it's all good so you may eat the whole thing. I've also tried the baklava and the guy also told me how to make it. It was amazing.< /review>

I am a frequent “take out” guy from MR Kebab, they know me as MR Barcalona. Being going there for years and have had no problems with the quality of food...... until last night.. June 7,2018. My usual order, Chicken Kebab plate.
The chicken was uncooked and the rice was very sticky and tasted like someone dropped a bag of salt in it. So I called up and spoke to someone who said he was the manager, first I asked if the place was under new management,and I told him I am a frequent customer and that this time the food was bad quality. His response “ sorry but are very busy that why”. I told him that was not acceptable, he didn’t seemed bothered,so I told him adios for ever.
Will neve Patronize ever!</Review>

I’ve been here a million times now. The owner Hasan loves making quality food. I’ve had their kubideh/Adana kabob and thought that was the best until they served me the Iskender Kebab and now I can’t eat anything but that. Hasan is so amazing with his employees (he call’s them partners) Rahul and Ravi are equally nice to me. Ask Hasan for his awesome black tea as a side order. I can’t eat ever without that flavorful tea.< /text>

This is the best kebob in the area. Don't miss it.
This is a great place to eat. Their Kabab is the best. I would give them 5 stars if they had provided the best service too.
I ordered on phone thinking about eating at the restaurant, but when I got there, I found my food packed for to go. I asked them that I wanted to eat in the restaurant, they gave me two plates and the boxes and told me to deal with it myself. Maybe, it was a misunderstanding or whatever. I still like this place and recommen it to others too.
Their foods are Halal.<//text>

<Review>I've been in this restaurant more than 10 times by now. The food tastes great and prices are really low. When I'm writing this review, you can get a chicken doner sandwich for $5.75 and the sandwich is huge!

Also try the deserts (baklava, kunefe,etc.). They are doing it there and they taste great! Worth a try.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Friendly family restaurant.   I've been there about 4 times now.  I've tried the fallafel plate, the chicken kebab, and the combo with lamb, beef, and chicken.   All were excellent at a very reasonable price.  The portions were large enough that I ended up eating half my wife's meal the next day for a full lunch.  My favorite is the fallafel plate with hummus, beans, and a mixed salad with bread.   Well worth going if you like Meditarranean/Turkish cuisine.</review>

Only loving, patient, knowledgeable and caring people work here.
I have adopted here, used their clinic services and they have helped me find my lost fur baby once a long time ago.
I love this place. They are an important part of our community. Our animal loved ones and us wouldn't be able to function properly without them.
It's the kind of place that makes a community better.<//Text>

<Text>I would leave 0 stars if I could. They tell you to be there at 7 for drop off of your animal, but you do not need to be there until 8 when the line has dwindled down to something acceptable. If you are coming from farther away than 20 minutes I would strongly suggest not getting there until 8:00 a.m. or going elsewhere. The staff was rude and discourteous and they never answer their phone. They do not verbally instruct on restrictions for surgery and expect the email that gets lost in your spam folder to do their job for them.  The idea was to save money but really it ended up costing in the long run because the drive. Spend your money elsewhere and start de-funding places like this.< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I have had two rabbits spayed at this clinic. Both healed well and had no complications. The price is very reasonable especially compared to other exotic animal vets which will charge $300-400 for a rabbit spay. The only reason that I am docking a star is for the following two reasons: 1. it is extremely difficult to get ahold of someone over the phone. Your best bet is to email to get an appointment, 2. the staff is under the false impression that you must fast a rabbit before surgery. DO NOT fast a rabbit prior to surgery it increases their chance of gut stasis and complications. Staff and logistics aside, the surgeon knows what he is doing and I can recommend a rabbit owner to this clinic.<//Review>

Compassionate staff with terrific follow-up. A little too much time spent on hold when communicating via telephone. Apparently the vet and assistants worked well with my cat as he was minimally traumatized after his visit.<//Text>

<Review>The people there are very nice but the way things are set up needs a little bit of work and you have people that let their dogs poop everywhere anywhere and some people don't pick it up you should have more chairs outside to sit-down outside in the shade for those that have knee problems back problems or if they are handicap.<//Review>< rate>

I brought in 3 cats to be spayed and the check in room was full of people with their dogs and cats. She expertly handled all concerns,  plus she took phone calls. She was knowlegable, polite, and had perfect poise. A job well done.<//review></record>

Ledesma Tire Shop, say's one thing and mean's another! Recommend having several stand bye shops numbers if you get turned down for service on your vehicle, i.e. ' Auto Worx' for alignment. Guys are old school and they make it right with no excuses!< /Text></record>

Used to be good. Last 2 visits, I took my truck to replace the tire valve. I ended up leaving with a huge bubble on the sidewall of my tire that is in brand new condition. I had just inspected the tire before taking it to get the valve replaced. It had no bubble. 2nd visit, I took my car (with brand new rims that I got on Dec 10) to rotate the tires. The guy who did the job let go one of my wheels letting it fall flat onto the ground. You could hear the loud bang from the rim hitting the concrete. The result, the entire border of my new rim was scraped and dented. Never coming back again.</text>

Wow.  The rumors are true about the staff being fast, attentive and friendly.  Came here on a Saturday at 3pm, and was hesitant on driving in because of how the lot looked "ran-down" to me;  my wife said to just go in, since we're here already, and was immediately attended to and told the prices of an oil change ($65 full synthetic).  I asked about a wait, and was told they could work on it now, to pull into the garage.
So far I'm impressed, as I write this while they work on the car; I noticed two of the mechanics whistle while they work, adds a certain assurance.
Usually I go to TomBell Chevrolet (Redlands) or Jiffy Lube (Anywhere); the former is a distance from us but a favorite of ours, and the latter is decent but can be expensive for no reason.  So, this may be our new place.
Took 15 minutes for this oil change.  Wow.<//Text>

These guys are friendly, fair and do great work.  From repairing two tires for me and doing the brakes on my Jetta I couldn't be happier.  If you need a dependable mecahnic in the Fontana area this is the place to go, period.< /Review>

I don't even know what Warhammer is. I just walked into this place thinking it was a board game store and Tony told me what it was about and then directed me to three different shops around the area that could provide what I was looking for. He also sent me away with a gift just for stopping by and now I will probably be back to learn how to play simply because of his demeanor. Absolute top-level customer service.< /Review>

The manager, Tony, hands down the best and most passionate person that I have had he pleasure of dealing with. Super knowledgeable and welcoming. If you’re new to the hobby like myself or thinking of seeing what it’s about, go to this store. Worth the trip if you are out of the area.</text>

Came from the Rancho area looking for a new hobby spot and checked this place out, and I gotta say it's great! It had some tables going, was well stocked and the manager, Tony, was extremely helpful and knowledgeable with what I needed! 5 stars, totally worth the drive< /Text>

My wife and I visited the shop and Tony took the time to help us get a paint scheme for her Thousand Sons army squared away.

I placed an order with Tony and it shipped FAST which was amazing considering the situation with the pandemic. Can't say enough good things about Tony and the store. Definitely stop by if you need someone who is friendly and knowledgeable about 40k. Besides who doesn't need another box for their army??< /text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

<Review>Updated
l called in searching for a 2 item which unfortunately were not there
However Tony the awesome guy who answered the phone was very kind and helpful
He seems to love his job which makes me happy and I would recommend him for anyone looking for help or awe inspiring service
10/10 Tony good job

I was finally able to visit the location in person
Tony greeted me kindly which kindness is in great demand these days
After informing him of my interests needs and price range he knew exactly what to suggest adding different examples with comparison in a very simple and comprehensible manner
I am very new to the games and Tony picked up on that
In truth he could have taken advantage of the situation and encourage unnecessary purchases
However he was more concerned with meeting my needs
"I'm not a salesman, I'm a consultant."-Tony
Because of his honesty and sincerity I now have the Elite Boxset with a unit of scouts on route to home

Minor note  I had called prior to arrival so as not to impose and made a minor request for him to spray disinfectant around just to ensure "Nurgle's blessing" was present
I could smell the subtle scent of it still in the air which set my mind at ease knowing that my two associates who are susceptible to the virus were taken care of
Thank you Tony
10/10 + 5 bonus points for spraying disinfectant< /Review>< pics>

As you'll see in the other reviews, Tony is one of the nicest guys you'll meet. If you have any questions or need anything, he can almost certainly help. If you're just getting in to the hobby like me, this is the place to do it!<//Review>

<Text>Great first impression. Great stock, good vibes from the one guy who runs the place. Not large enough play space though to support more then 4-6 players at a time. More of a store then a place to bring tons of tabletop friends and hangout. Needs more chairs and space to play.<//Text>< Pictures>

So I was just walking through the strip mall and was not really sure what I was walking into.  My first impression was awesome thanks to Tony.  He was extremely welcoming and passionate about this game.  While it might not be for me at this time, anyone who is into this stuff appears to be in great hands with staff like Tony!</text>

Great GW store. Tony is great and extremely helpful. The shop is small but they have painting tables and war tables ready to use most days. The selection of 40k and Sigmar is great.< /review>

Had the absolute pleasure to meet Store Manager Tony today at the Riverside Warhammer. He is engaging, friendly, and passionate about all things Warhammer.

Wishing him and the Riverside store all the best, I have no doubt this location will continue to thrive for years to come!< /text>

I found this location on accident during some halloween shopping next door, I am fairly new to warhammer and dont really know too much but the manager tony makes everyone feel welcome and comfortable enough to ask for any help with anything you dont understand. I'll be coming here for all of my warhammer needs< /Text>

Walked in the store a few weeks ago, store owner Tony is great, explained everything from building painting and running the demo. I was nervous about joining because of not knowing if there would be enough people to play with.....but everone is friendly and you can always get a match and build and paint your army without feeling rushed.</text>

I walked in looking for some minis to use in my D&D campaign, I walked out with a new hobby (Warhammer of course) and new friends. Now I have a new hang out spot for working on minis and I love the vibe here!</review>

What a wonderful community theater! The seats are comfy and the facility really clean! Today my best and I saw Young Frankenstein and it was fantastic! It was just the right amount of ridiculousness! The play was hilarious and the cast was perfect! Bravo to all who put on tonight's production! Hope to see this play again next year and more Mel Brooks productions!  Will definitely be back to this theater!</text>

< Review>
The theater is great as a theater goes however, the "Gestapo" from Dance Image who goes way overboard with the preshow announcements regarding the taking of photos, theatre etiquette, etc. always is beyond extreme. If you are there for the annual recital of the aforementioned performing arts company and its your first time BE READY for that guy😂🙄!</Review>

This civic theater has one level about 400 seats. Two aisles and several entrances. Parking is free but one has to navigate several skinny lots located to side and back of theater. Very comfortable seats and good view lines to stage. The production we saw was Hunchback of Notre Dame. Big cast and chorus with live orchestra. Wonderful and heartfelt.<//review>

<Review>I've been to a number of performances here over the last few years and have always had a good experience.  Excellent shows and a comfortable venue.  The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that intermissions are generally a little too short (not enough time to finish a cup of coffee or hot chocolate) and the parking can be a little tricky if you arrive late.  But worth the drive.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2d393990cfee5:0xda69cc4c6f4fd3be</gmap_id><Resp>None</Resp>< Pics>

<username>Phil Goodman<//username><review>If you have never seen live theater, what are you waiting for?  Their productions are 100% professional and the ticket are very inexpressive.  Get their season tickets and save even more.  If you really dig it, then consider getting involved with helping them produce their next production.  Set construction, painting, staring... Okay, one step at a time.</review></record></dataset><record>

In the world of high end jewelry/watch shopping there's Davidson and Licht and then there's everyone else. From the moment the door is opened for you by a dapper gentleman who smiles and calls your attention to the hand sanitizer, to the champagne/scotch (or chilled bottled water if you prefer) and candied orange slices. This place is pure class without the pretentiousness which usually accompanies multi-million dollar jewelry caches and Rolex/Cartier Authorized Dealer status.

My wife and I spent at least two hours (probably closer to three) poring over various Rolex, Cartier and IWC watches and truly extravagant jewelry. Not once did we feel pressured to purchase. Not once did we encounter the "slickness" all too familiar in high end sales salons. What we did feel was supported and guided through our decision making process. To that end, we owe particular thanks to Orlando, his expertise and his patience. Aside from being a genuine and convivial fellow, it was clearly important to Orlando that our purchase was the right purchase for us. No pressure. No undue urgency tactics. He simply used his knowledge and experience to educate us about what we might like the most and let our preferences lead us from there. Thank you Orlando and thank you Davidson and Licht for a magnificent shopping experience!<//text>

I've bought two watches from Davidson & Licht and will 100% be coming back in the future. The store is conveniently located, spacious, and spotless. The staff is friendly, knowledgable, and accommodating.

I mainly worked with Jake for my purchases and that experience was nothing but phenomenal.  The first watch purchased was a gift for my Dad so there were quite a few unknowns at the time.  Jake was able to help walk me through the decision process, find me the perfect watch, and extended the return/exchange window to make sure I felt as comfortable as possible with the purchase.

After that first experience, I was hooked. Jake stayed in touch via email, and kept an eye out for a particular watch. We checked in monthly, and he was able to find me my watch much earlier than expected. The pick up process felt VIP -- special presentation table, sizing, detailed explanation, everything! Jake and Kevin went the extra mile to make sure the experience was flawless.<//text>

My husband and I came here looking to replace an engagement ring, I was looking for something similar, but of course better. We always try to buy from family owned businesses whenever possible, so when I was searching here on Google I looked for 3 things. Of course best reviews, being family owned, and also being around for more than 30 years, so we went to Davidson & Licht. We had the pleasure of Orlando assisting us, he was very helpful at helping design a ring to my desire, and it turned out more beautiful than I ever imagined. We also had a deadline that we hoped to have it done by, and he was able to make that happen for us, with a few days to spare too! I couldn't be happier! Thank you Orlando and thank you Davidson & Licht< /text>

Excellent service. Orlando was quite professional. He took the time to answer our questions, understanding that we do not live in close proximity to the store and it wasn't like we could just drop in at any time. On the phone, he exhibited patience with his courteous nature. In person, he displayed class, was polite to my family & pleasantly assisted us throughout the entire process without making us feel any pressure whatsoever. Highly recommend this business & that you go in and see for yourself!< /text>

After a pleasant conversation on the phone with Jake a few days prior, my wife and I dropped into the store last Sunday to check out some watches. We were greeted at the front by Kirby who was extremely friendly. The store at the time was rather busy, but multiple individuals continued to check in with us while we waited.

We were eventually helped by Orlando, who was incredibly professional and patient. My wife had a rough idea of which watches she liked but wanted to see some on wrist. Orlando stood by offering information and support as she tried on several before landing on a particular Cartier model.

We couldn’t be happier with our first experience here. Definitely plan to be back!< /Text>< pics>

I went to Davidson and Licht to get my watch tuned up and repaired. I was greeted by Alex and then introduced to Jake who oversees the repair department in Walnut Creek. Both men were very cordial and efficient. Jake made a couple of recommendations, gave me a quote and a timeline and I was on to my next appointment in a timely fashion.  I was very impressed.<//text>

<review>What can I say, Jeremiah is simply the BEST!!!
He help me find a nice gift for myself. Several of my friends have dealt with him in the past and he came highly recommended. He did not disappoint! He was able to find the exact watch that I wanted and his service and communication was top notch. I look forward to reaching out to him the next time I’m in the market for a timepiece. Well done Jeremiah, well done my friend.< /review>< Pics>

First time purchasing Panerai from this store. Jake was so kindly helping me through out the process including email back and forth.

He even setting the watch aside for me until I came to make the purchase since it was the only one left in the store.

Couldn’t be happier than that!

Top notch & all stars customer service indeed.

Will be back when I’m ready for my next watch collection.

<text>Absolute best service around.

A few years back we had D&L custom design and build all our rings and we were blown away at the level of service from everyone at the Walnut Creek store.

Recently we went in to get our rings resized. The process was not only painless but the staff was so kind and helpful once again. The high level of service combined with the quality workmanship are just a few of the many reasons we won’t be going anywhere else as long as D&L is around.

Thank you all!< /text>< UserId.>

He treated us and our “treasures” with great respect and even cleaned them along with my wife’s rings.

Everyone there is very professional and friendly, and I’ve never felt pressured to purchase something I didn’t want. On top of that they have a lot of small touches throughout the purchase to make it unique and special. I’d also like to give a special shout-out to Jeremiah and Orlando for being a huge help with all my purchases!<//Review>< rating>

<Text>Amazing experience buying new earrings.  We arranged to meet Paul on a friday afternoon.  He spent over an hour with us looking through their collection to find the right pair and even offering options to possibly make custom changes.  They have a beautiful selection of fine jewelry and their staff have years of experience to suggest the right shape, cut and size to match your style, appearance and budget.  Especially like the idea of the wish list they will keep, so hubby can go by before holidays or birthdays to see what I have picked out!< /Text>< Response>

Incredible, simply incredible. Purchased a Rolex from Ruslana last year and have been back several times since. Even if we’re in for a quick shine, Davidson & Licht treats us like royalty. This is the kind of jeweler that you want to build a lifetime relationship with - we pass dozens of jewelers on the way from San Francisco just to experience Davidson & Licht. They are really THAT great!</Review>

They listed to me what I wanted as a customer and provided me few options. They were not trying to make a sale. Their goal was my satisfaction. I really appreciated that. Thank you Janel and Orlando. I am very happy 😀😀😀😀. I will remember this experience for the rest of my life.</Review>< name>

< Review>
I had the absolute pleasure of being assisted by Janell. She was patient and very knowledgeable. I had told her that my intent was to try some rings on and learn more about cut, clarity and color. She didn’t treat me any different after knowing I wouldn’t be purchasing anything as I was just in the preliminary stages of doing my research. I 100% recommend working with Janell.<//Review>

I have a passion for horology and have been searching for like minded enthusiasts who could educate, guide me to the right pieces to add to my modest collection.

Jake F at D&L has been an amazing consultant, who sets proper expectations and looks to provide options on what could be a fit based on my personal style and interests.  I rarely take the time to write a review but he went well beyond my expectations of being a true sales professional.

When I first stopped into Davidson & Licht seven months ago to inquire about a grail watch, I was immediately impressed with their overall professionalism and especially their highly knowledgeable staff. I felt an immediate connection with Jake as we talked watches. I placed myself on their waitlist and Jake and I kept in touch via email after that initial visit.

A month ago I again visited Jake at D&L to ask about a specific watch for my sixtieth birthday. Jake said he could get it. Sure enough, last Friday Jake called to say he had the watch. I immediately drove over and purchased it. Jake was great at explaining everything about owning the watch and he even sized it perfectly the first time (no small feat). Not once did I feel pressured to buy. My entire experience with D&L and Jake has been nothing but positive. Thank you!<//text>

I have purchased two watches at D&L and in both instances the service was simply outstanding. Incredible staff, very helpful and knowledgeable. A special shout to Orlando, who served me both time - they don't come any better. He made the whole buying experience an absolute joy. The fact is you can buy most (if not all) of the brands that D&L carry for the same price at many stores, so how you are treated is the difference. And i have never been treated better as a customer than I have at Davidson & Licht.</text>

Had a decent experience. The representative that helped me was very knowledgeable and did not pressure me into buying anything. He gave me several options and answered every question I had. My only concern was he could have been more attentive when it came down to purchasing the ring. Updates on when the ring will be in and why it took a while to receive the ring after paying in full. I had to reach out personally to find out. Customer service could have been better, as far as offering water, etc especially when deciding to make a big purchase with a well established jeweler. Overall  they have great product and are knowledgeable. Customer service could improve.</text>

I cannot say enough about her professionalism, enthusiasm and her personal approach to helping her customers. If you want a no pressure and down to earth experience shopping, I highly recommend seeing Ruslana.< /review>< Pics>

I've been on the market for a new time piece for quite some time, and there are only so many authorized dealers  in the area. I specifically chose Davidson & Licht purely based on reading reviews, and I had no doubt in mind this was where I wanted to go.

From the moment I called and inquired, David was fantastic. He answered all my questions and provided me names of potentials representatives to ask for if I were ever to come in. I ended up going the very next day, today.

David recommend speaking with Jeremiah, and I noticed there were a lot of great things said about him based on other reviews. When I arrived, I was greeted right at the front door. Everyone wore mask and you get hand sanitizer right when you enter. I initially said no to water but was brought one anyway, thanks! I let the nice representative in the yellow dress know I was waiting for Jeremiah. Orlando came over, greeted me and started to help me. I didn't want to wait too long so why not. Once Jeremiah freed up from his previous client, he came over and stepped in. It was awesome to see the teamwork and camaraderie among peers.

My experience with Jeremiah was great. He is definitely a product expert, knew everything about the pieces I was asking about. He was also very patient and sincere as I was debating between a few different pieces. He was honest, never once made me feel like I had to purchase anything. I never felt he was pushy or just trying to make a sale. I guess that's the different when it comes to luxury retail. I ended up picking up the piece I came in for, and the whole experience was everything I expected and some. We ended up having a nice conversation, not even about watches. Jeremiah and Davidson & Licht is my go-to now moving forward for time pieces.

Jake also came and helped me size my piece, much appreciated. He went above and beyond to make sure it felt just right. The entire team here at Davidson & Licht really made me feel at home and great about my purchase. Everyone was beyond helpful and a pleasure to work with. They are as advertised, and I recommend coming here for all your time piece/jewelry needs. It's all about the experience, and that was exactly what I got.

Big shout out to Jeremiah, Jake and Orlando, and the nice lady in the yellow dress. You got a customer for life. I'll always stop by when I'm in the area.<//Text>

René and I had such a wonderful experience at Davidson & Licht. Orlando was tireless and professional in his efforts to support us as we searched for our wedding rings. As diamond novices, he was patient and taught us both all about diamonds so we could choose the perfect stone for my ring. Once we had a chance to shop in several stores, we knew that this was our shop and Orlando was our guy. I have the most beautiful ring and we're so thankful to Davidson & Licht for the impeccable customer service and stunning jewelry that will keep bringing us both back for future purchases. Thank you!< /text>

Ruslana has been welcoming every time my family goes to this Walnut Creek location.  She also is very engaging, often keeping me in mind when pieces come in. The occasional phone call or text, along with her welcoming demeanor make me want to come in and skip other local jewelers. And when she’s not around Jeremiah and the other sales staff share the same courtesy.</review>

<text>Been to a couple Rolex authorized dealers but not like Davidson and licht in Walnut Creek the service was great and Orlando who had helped me narrow down my choice was very knowledgeable. Everything from the little candy snacks, to the cold bottled water and the champagne glass to celebrate the purchase. I Was able to get complementary custom engraving which was really cool. If you are looking for a new watch or piece of jewelry with no pressure experience this is the place will definitely come back here for all my jewelry needs.<//text>< Time>

I went to their store looking to get a custom wedding ring after I heard great reviews from some friends. Everyone there was extremely professional and the all around service was fantastic. I got to work with Alex Licht mostly who was their custom jeweler and I couldn't be more happy with the service and the final product! He was able to create everything to my exact (and slightly ridiculous) wishes which I was do grateful for. Needless to say I will be going back to Alex and the rest of the team for all my future jewelry needs.</Review>

<review>Overall, I had a positive and pleasant experience at Davidson & Licht. Jake Flood was courteous, knowledgeable and most of all patient. He helped me decide what model of Rolex to purchase. The watch is on my wrist as I’m writing this short review and I love it. Thanks Jake!</review>< response>

Doing business with Davidson and Licht is a pleasure.  They have a very good selection of unique jewelry all of which is high quality.  Orlando was more than helpful and very knowledgeable regarding their product.  I have been and will continue to be a patron.  They will be able to take care of all your jewelry needs,</Review>

< Review>
When my husband and I went to look for engagement rings 4 years ago he asked if I cared where he purchased a ring from. I told him somewhere that is reputable but most importantly a place that will treat us like family. You have your pick of reputable jewelers in the East Bay but none compare to the service, friendship, and experience you will get at Davidson and Licht! Any time we find ourselves walking around downtown Walnut Creek we will pop in to get our rings cleaned, typically a quick in and out activity at most jewelers, when we walk in we are greeted by name as if we are walking into our families homes for a visit. By the time we find ourselves leaving its been a 45 plus minute visit catching up with everyone. LIke I said the employees are like family and treat us like family. We have worked with Orlando since day one and over the years our relationship has gone from client, jewelry to a true friendship. If Orlando isn't available or isn't in everyone else we have worked with has gone above and beyond to make us feel at home. Davidson and Licht is everything we hoped for in a family jewelry< /Review>

Excellent customer service from professional, courteous and passionate team. I have purchased several watches from D&L and now consider them my only AD in procuring hard to find pieces. Orlando has helped me with my selections and I highly recommend his services in particular. 5 start experience after the sale for any kind of services that your watch might require, as well< /Text>

I wanted to recognize two individuals at Davidson & Licht, 1 whom I’ve built a great relationship with and made a purchase of Tudor Watch for my fiancé back in October of 2020, and then 2nd individual whom I made several purchases with at Forevermark Jewlers also in Downtown Walnut Creek who is a recent addition now to the Davidson & Licht family. Jeremiah Aguiao who is the manager at this store went above and beyond to make sure that I was satisfied with my purchase, my fiancé had purchased 2 watches previously from here for her employees and I wanted to get her something nice for her birthday. I had originally ordered a Tudor Watch back in August of 2020 and was told it would take about 3 months to get in, unfortunately it kept getting pushed back and back but eventually I was able to secure a different Tudor Watch for my fiancé and Jeremiah was able to work with me on an even more expensive Tudor Watch in which my fiancé really liked! I’m looking forward to doing a lot of business with Jeremiah in the near future. The 2nd individual who’s new to Davidson & Licht is Hank Stenner, I’m so excited for Hank and his new role with Davidson & Licht, my fiancé and I had a previous existing relationship with Hank when he was at Forevermark in Downtown Walnut Creek, I purchased several pieces from him there over the last 2 years. Hank is a professional and takes a valued interest in what’s important to your needs and goes above and beyond to make things happen. I’m excited for what his future will look like with this store. We stopped in a few days ago to look at some pieces and Hank was awesome as always.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

We had 2 watches that needed tune up /cleaning.  I got mine back on time but my
wife’s needed further work. We went to Hawaii and got held up there for 9 months. Davidson & Licht kept us posted about the watch. The staff  are very knowledgeable and professional. I highly recommend this company and will not hesitate to be repeat customer.< /review>

The people at D&L are pros, very friendly and attentive. I’ve purchase two watches from them.

The warranty on my watch was still in place however the watch was sent to Rolex in Texas and Rolex would not honor the warranty based on what they called impact damage. I didn’t damage the watch. It just stopped. What’s the use of a warranty then?</text>

Awesome Experience! I’ll give them 10 stars!!! The doorman was courteous. The staff were so attentive. As soon as we walked in,  we were offered something to drink such as water or coffee. Jeremiah (in-charge of the watch Dept) answered all our questions and helped us find the perfect Rolex watch for my husband’s birthday gift. Ruslana, the sales lady who finalized the sale, provided us with excellent customer service and offered us champagne. Both Jeremiah and Ruslana were very professional, knowledgeable, and very patient. We are so pleased. We will definitely buy from Davidson and Licht again.<//review>

I, initially, contacted this AD via phone.  Ruslana gave me an insight of the current availability/allocation of certain Rolex models and the wait list process.  Her friendly demeanor, ability to listen and willingness to answer my inquiries that most of the AD’s lacked, without a doubt, made me choose them.  I’ve visited/phoned several of them in NorCal, but did not have the same reception.

My initial impression was more apparent when I visited her to check out their current inventory and express my interest on certain models.  Although I left the shop empty handed, she assured to keep me posted.  She did just that.

As promised, I was invited on two separate occasions as models on my list were available.  However, I had to pass as both of the timepieces didn’t sit right on my wrist.  They were too big on my wrist.  She completely understood and said, “I wouldn’t be offended if you don’t purchase it.  I want you to be happy and have the right watch that you really want.”

Today, it’s was third time the charm.  Unexpectedly, she called and I drove there.  I end up with “the watch.”  She was patient enough to provide a quick tutorial about the watch.

I give D&L five stars for the unmatched service.  Thank you for the hard work.< /text>

<review>Ruslana Jurkovic was the kindest and most courteous jeweler I have ever worked with.  I have been in many jewelry & fine watch stores and she is not only been the best but also highly knowledgeable on the purchase I was hoping to make (which I made a week later after contemplation).

Had another great experience at D&L. All the staff were very friendly during a very busy time on Christmas Eve. Special thanks to Orlando who was great and helped me with a watch. I highly recommend D&L.</Review>

Davidson and Licht in Walnut Creek has been providing my family excellent service and support over the years.  Most recently, Ruslana Jurkovic has really impressed us with knowing what exactly will look best....be a new piece for my wife or a watch for myself.  Highly recommended.< /review>

Helpful staff. The doorman is a nice touch. Came to look for a Panerai watch. The selection was lower than normal, being the 26th of December, but the salesman did share other inventory with me and suggested he could order as well.< /Text>

Jeremiah and the crew at D&L are really great to work with, very professional and very nice as well.  I picked up my first new Rolex from them and it was a top notch experience.  They have an excellent selection of watches and jewelry and I found the staff to be friendly and welcoming.   They’re at the top of my list for my next watch/jewelry purchase.<//review>

Blown away by the service. I sent an email asking about the wait times for a black bay 58 (expecting it to be several months). Orlando called me back within the hour to tell me they had one in the showcase and it was on my wrist the next business day. Will definitely go back for any luxury watch purchases in the future.< /text>

<text>I stopped by today to pick up
my watch that I had repaired. Foolish me arrived 3 minutes after closing time. What most don’t know is jewelry stores can’t let people in after closing due to insurance / safety reasons. Kevin happened to be outside and after talking to me he was able to facilitate getting me my watch by going to the back alley. I’ve been without my favorite watch for months thanks to Covid and Kevin made sure I didn’t have to wait any longer. This is just another example of the littler things Davidson &. Licht do for their customers. Thank you!< /text><pics>None<//pics><Response>{'time': 1605734259766, 'text': "Michael, We are happy to hear that you had a great experience with our Team member Kevin.

<Review>We had a wonderful experience buying two new Rolex timepieces with Jeremiah. He allowed us to take as much time as we needed to make our selections. He was gracious, courteous, patient, knowledgeable, and very easy to work with. We will continue to work with Jeremiah for all of our timepiece and jewelry needs.< /Review>< userid>

We thoroughly enjoyed our watch shopping experience at Davidson & Licht.  Jeremiah was extremely professional and knowledgeable.  He helped me in advance to surprise my husband with a Rolex for his birthday and made sure the adjustment was perfect.  It made the birthday celebration absolutely special.< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>The folks at D&L really are extremely friendly and helpful.  I was looking for a hard to find Rolex watch and they suggested I add my name to their waiting list. I wasn’t optimistic but I went ahead and sent an email with my details. Jeremiah responded graciously to my request and encouraged me to check back in occasionally.  Each time I visit I’m greeted with friendly hellos and a very knowledgeable staff. And just a day after the last time I checked in Jeremiah followed up with a phone call. With their most recent Rolex shipment, the watch I was looking for had arrived!  This is a first class local jewelry store where service is everything.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I love coming to Davidson & Licht Store. Their customer service is great. You will always receive first-class treatment here. The entire staff is amazing.
Last week I received a call from Orlando that my new Tudor Black Bay GMT had arrived. This is a pretty difficult watch to obtain. I picked it up on Saturday and I absolutely love it. Thanks to Davidson & Licht and Orlando I'm enjoying my first Tudor. I appreciate it very much.
Thank you guys, you are the best!<//review>

Great experience! Went in to look at wedding bands for myself. Kevin Yates assisted us and was so nice, knowledgeable and helpful. He suggest a ring I loved, helped with sizing and offered to call the designer directly to customize it. The next day followed up to tell me they could do exactly what I wanted and had the order all ready to go. My fiancé and I even enjoyed a glass of champagne while we were shopping. Thanks Yates!!< /Review>

We came here looking for an engagement ring. We were treated with excellent service and would definitely come back here. The service is second to none. Orlando did an excellent job taking care of our needs and really went the extra mile to explain certain aspects of a ring to us. We will definitely come back here. Thank you so much!< /Review>

Back in 1996 when I was 5, my mom and I went to Davidson and Licht to buy my dad a watch for his birthday.

After we’d spent a few hours in the store and she’d picked out the watch, the owner said he had a surprise for me. He presented me with this ring and said he wanted to give me my first diamond. 23 years later, here it is!

Thank you Davidson and Licht for such a thoughtful gesture that really went the extra mile! What amazing service, it meant so much to us back then, and I still wear the ring on my pinky now!<//Review>

<text>Friendly without pressure atmosphere. They provide you with all the information and allow you to shop without pressure. Customer service is excellent. Glass of wine/champagne/water, they will feed the meter on their dime, etc. I've personally worked with Orlando and can't say enough about his service.</text>< Pics>

<Text>We have shopped at Davidson and Licht for the past 10 years.  We have never been disappointed. The quality of the various pieces of jewelry offered, from a variety of artisans, is excellent.
We have had the absolute pleasure of working mostly with Ruslana, and sometimes Mary.
Through the years we have purchased many beautiful Mikimoto pearl pieces. Ruslana recently worked closely with our son to create a custom diamond engagement ring.
Whether we just stop by to look, or go inside with the intention of purchasing something, we are greeted with a genuine smile by everyone and we are never rushed.  We wouldn’t buy jewelry anywhere else.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

All of the folks here are so friendly, professional, welcoming and knowledgeable. In particular, I’ve had lovely chats with Mary, Kevin, Orlando, and, of course, Jeremiah. He manages the watch side of the house, as far as as I know, and he loves, loves watches and knows the brands inside and out. From Jeremiah, I purchased a signet ring, a Tudor Black Bay 58, and, most recently, an IWC Spitfire (new for 2019). Jeremiah has a great, intuitive sense for what sort of watch would integrate well with a client’s collection. Of course, you have to let him know what you’ve got already to better inform his already exquisite intuitive sense of what might work for you. I cannot recommend Jeremiah highly enough. Super nice gentleman, total professional and a down-to-earth guy. I know I’ll be buying more watches from him in the future. Thank you!</Text>

It has been a few years since I've been into this store. When I entered today, they remembered me and took the time to catch up on things. I found what I wanted quickly and was able to pay and get gift wrapping quickly. Great place to do your fine jewelry purchased.<//review>

This store is great and they have a spectacular watch and jewelry selection. Orlando helped me and is awesome at making sure my needs were met. I bought all my watches here and they’re excellent at keeping them maintained. I bring them in yearly and never had any problems with them. They are very professional with servicing and are excellent at communicating when your watch is ready for pick up. I would deal with these guys again and again.</Review>

I received "the call" today from Kevin regarding my interest in getting a Rolex watch after waiting a reasonable amount of time on a waitlist. I arrived at the Davidson & Licht store a couple of hours later to pick up my watch. I am a returning customer and was treated with 1st class service and education - not unlike the first time I bought a watch with them 2 years ago. Kevin explained so much about the watch and Rolex and even had my other watch cleaned while I was waiting. Every time I have visited this store, the presentation of the merchandise, the customer service from the front door greeter to the watch professionals are just the best. I will always buy my fine watches with these folks. After returning to work later in the afternoon, I called Kevin again to thank him. I am beyond thrilled with my experience! This is the store to go to...</review>

<Text>From the moment you walk in or if you call,  the service is excellent. They are informative,  helpful, and communicate clearly. I had a simple service of taking out a few links. Even though the watch was purchased as a gift from another state, they did the modification quickly and honored the manufacturer service agreement. I thought it was unfair that they were not charging me anything I offered and insisted to pay for the service. They declined politely.  The watches and jewelry they display are all beautiful and with the highest quality in mind. Go in and admire their offerings and the staff also teach you so much about jewels and watches. I would recommend them highly if you need any jewelry services or purchases.-Dr. Janice Wang DDS< /Text>< pics>

I have purchased a couple of items here. Jeremiah has been extremely helpful each and every time along with the other associates. I didn’t know what to expect the first time walking into the store as I was in gym clothes but they didn’t seem to mind and was friendly and answered all my questions. The whole staff is friendly and easy to talk to. Recommend coming here and you won’t be disappointed.< /review>

Orlando was absolutely fantastic. Product knowledge was A++. Customer service was a 20/10. He had patience, showed us options, and ultimately helped me pick out a watch that I love! I’ve worked with Orlando for years and he always delivers a top quality experience. Thanks again!<//Text>

The more I work with Jeremiah, John and the D&L team the more they become a true partner in providing those special pieces for life’s special moments.  I just picked up a Rolex for my mom who is turning 75 and the thoughtfulness and attention to detail in making everything perfect was just great.  They go above and beyond.

Very kind and knowledgeable staff.  They don’t follow you around like other jewelers do, they give you your space and are happy to come over when you’re ready. We’ve had numerous transactions with them over the years and are the only jeweler my wife and I trust.</Review>

I’ve had my eye on that clever and unique little tool watch- the North Flag- for quite some time.  Came into the store for the first time, and Kevin provided me with outstanding service, showing me all the features of the watch, explaining why it was so special, while also showing me and explaining the differences in other Tudor references.

I returned to the store about 2 weeks later, when I was ready to purchase.  This time Jeremiah assisted me.  He was simply amazing and treated me like I was a long time customer, even though it was only my second time in the store.  I was not rushed, pressured, nor looked down upon in any way.  While he was preparing the purchase, I wandered over to the Rolex display and returned to advise him of my admiration for the Air King, and without hesitation, he brought it over for me to try on.  Simply stunning watch!!

Treating me with respect not ‘going through the motions’ goes along with me, and Kevin and Jeremiah deserve 6 out of 5 stars!!</review>

The staff is lovely and knowledgeable.  I needed the clasp on my watch tightened and assumed they would have to send it back to Cartier. They fixed it right there, right away and for free! And then cleaned my watch for me! Thank you guys. I will be back!</review>

We’ve been regular customers for years. It’s always a pleasure to do business with the knowledgeable staff at Davidson & Licht.

Over the years they’ve helped us with jewelry and watch repair, and special orders. I’ve purchased watches there, and they have an impressive selection of unique jewelry from creative and talented designers.</text>

The experience was truly fun and exciting, not intimidating at all. If buying a watch is this enjoyable, then I’m in trouble because it’s going to be the start of an expensive collection (or investment). Time to start saving for the next watch!<//Review>< Pics>

I have traveled the world over and have been to their countries best jewelry stores. When I was younger, naturally naïve, for jewelry I went to Tiffany’s to by jewelry for my girlfriends. Yes they were giddy and happy. However, if you know anything about jewelry, the saying would be something like ‘everyone has that exact same jewelry’. (Plus Tiffany’s name on the item is 40% of the cost) It worked in high school, but what would really stand out is something unique that was special and leaves an impact. Davidson and Licht is the diamond in the rough! The elegance of white gloves door men, complementary offering while you browse. A rotating selection so you will keep coming back. Absolutely friendly staff lead with elegance by the ultimate maestro, Orlando, that will do anything to help you and even procure exactly what you desire. They will never ever push you to buy anything, they are honest, and care about you unlike almost every other jewelry store. Every time you visit they will be happy to clean your jewelry. Walk in with no intention and just look... I have found one of kind jewelry that spoke to me, that embodied my relationship with my partner so perfectly that when I presented it to her it was as if I had proposed. They can also offer you the best gem stones in the world. This place is not just for women, it is equally for men as well. My first purchase was ‘Hearts on Fire’ diamond studs. (A diamond cut 100x the precision over all others, of the four C’s in diamond rating the cut is most important) Personally I am a watch collector. A mechanical watch mechanism created centuries ago is still considered the highest reaches of mans mechanical achievements, period. They have a watchmaker and goldsmith on sight as well. It’s a one stop shop for all your jewelry wants and needs like maintenance. They have gone all out to get me a Rolex almost impossible to get, but they got it! They have guided me though it all. I am a pilot myself and they suggested the new B55 Breitling, it was meant to be and literally saved my life! Honestly each watch they sell is very special. These watches are meant to last a lifetime and an Heirloom for all generations. I want them all, the IWC Pilot, the Cartier, Tudor and many more. Of course Rolex is the best for a reason. They are the best engineered and always one step ahead of everyone else with unmatchable precision. Everyone there knows my name and greet me with smiles and we converse like you would with any friend you haven’t seen for a period of time. Originally they were in a small mall location... Now they are on Main Street and a beautiful two story building that has clean lines yet that classic elegance (and finally! Parking in the back) They will go out of their way to assist you. The second floor could be arraigned for a private moment where they can arrange Champaign, flowers in a pristine environment exuding with elegance for moments such aa an anniversary or proposal. Often walking out of Tiffany’s my wallet hurts, leaving Davidson and Licht’s lights my soul and leaves a lasting genuine smile on my face. I will never go anywhere else. The owner Jon is very personable, caring, supremely genuine and I respect him for his leadership and creating the adults ultimate ‘candy store.’ His son Alex is an amazing goldsmith. Support this FAMILY OWNED business and you will never be disappointed! It is truly a unique treasure that is rare in these modern times; every customer is a VIP! I implore you to take the time even to just visit; give it a shot and I promise you will understand. Satisfaction Guaranteed.</Text>

<time>1563310569377<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><text>Orlando is an amazing Consultant.  He is very knowledgeable and fun to work with.  We looked at many diamonds and settings and he never tried to rush us or push us to pick a certain one.  When I found the setting I wanted, I asked about customizing it.  My fiancé was not sure what we were designing so Orlando took the time to “mock up” a sample so David could understand what we were talking about.  After we were done, he said he would check if my requests were possible and get back to us.  Within a couple days he let us know it could be customized the way I wanted.  I am very excited to see my custom ring finished in a few weeks.

My 16 year old daughter had her late aunt’s ring which she had been wearing on a chain because it was way too small.  The staff carefully examined it and said they could make it to the correct size.  She was very worried because it is her prized possession.  When she got it back and put it on she nearly cried!  It was beautifully done!

The entire staff was gracious each time we visited!  It is the kind of customer service that really stands out.< /text>< pics>

We brought along a loose diamond purchased elsewhere to have it evaluated as well. We were not treated very nicely at a local competitor when they found out we would not be buying the diamond from them....they were actually rude. They ultimately showed us a diamond that was very poor quality-almost the poorest. This is why we decided to come here instead. I am so glad we did! We were greeted, and after giving some initial information we were offered water and champagne. What a different experience already. We met Orlando, who helped us patiently and informatively through the process of choosing a style and material to best suit the pear shaped diamond we brought in. Orlando also took the time to evaluate our stone and give his honest opinion-he was impressed and in no way annoyed that we already purchased a diamond. We were more than pleased with our entire experience here. I look forward to writing another great review once we have the completed ring!!<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>They were very nice and courteous. From the door valet greeting us with his smile and guiding us in the right direction to the respectful assistance we got from the representative. We went to get a Rolex watch and a put in a repair for a Citizen watch. The representative educated us on the different eras the watches were, the potential type of repairs and options we would have if they couldn't repair it. He even provided estimates on the values of the watch. The water and candy were a nice touch as well. The representatives were even attentive to my rambunctious toddler. The only reason why I give them 4 stars is because upon my return the 2nd time to pick up my repairs, the representative different from the first was very snappy and she wasn't as welcoming and helpful</text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They were very nice and courteous. From the door valet greeting us with his smile and guiding us in the right direction to the respectful assistance we got from the representative. We went to get a Rolex watch and a put in a repair for a Citizen watch. The representative educated us on the different eras the watches were, the potential type of repairs and options we would have if they couldn't repair it. He even provided estimates on the values of the watch. The water and candy were a nice touch as well. The representatives were even attentive to my rambunctious toddler. The only reason why I give them 4 stars is because upon my return the 2nd time to pick up my repairs, the representative different from the first was very snappy and she wasn't as welcoming and helpful</Text>< Date>

This is the only place anyone should ever purchase a watch from! They have amazing customer service, they remember you when you walk in, and the staff is always friendly. I have had the privilege of working with Orlando, and have purchased two watches and a winder from the store. The price is fair, Orlando bends over backwards to ensure you are satisfied with your purchase and they always return phone calls. When customer service is coming hard to find, Orlando and the staff at D&L have not forgotten what is important. Highly recommend, there is no one better!</text>

The Team at D&L is always friendly, welcoming and eager to assist.  The overall experience is very pleasant. Employees like Jeremiah build long term client relationships. Through a wealth of knowledge and advocacy with Dealers, there isn’t much he and others cannot do for you. Our family has been doing business there for almost 20 years. In today’s world, that says something!< /text>

<text>This was my first visit to Davidson & Licht Jewelers. I was assisted by Jeremiah regarding a vintage, 1940’s watch repair. Finding the correct parts for this very old but sentimental piece was a lengthy task. I was extremely impressed by Jeremiah’s follow up, letting me know the difficulties that the watchmaker was experiencing. Unfortunately, in the end, a complete repair was not able to be accomplished but the watch was returned running, lubed, and the crystal beautifully polished. I will once again cherish wearing my father’s watch in spite of it running a tad bit fast.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Wonderful jeweler where I purchased my first luxury watch 5 years ago and have been impressed with their service ever since. You do truly feel like royalty when you walk in , from the doorman who greats you, the offer of bottled water and candy orange wedges (on a silver platter!), to the personalized attention with sales associates remembering you by name! I highly recommend D&L!</Review>< userid>

Orlando is absolutely amazing. After failing to find the quality of services both myself and my soon-to-be fiancé were looking for at both Shane and Tiffany’s, we were relieved to find someone as knowledgeable and friendly as Orlando Rosario at your Walnut Creek location.

Not only did he help me find the perfect engagement ring, his level of professionalism and sincerity has assured me that I have found someone with the level of expertise I have been looking for.

I would recommend Davidson and Licht to my family, friends, colleagues, and  acquaintances.

Thank you Orlando and everyone at Davidson and Licht. I am happy for all your assistance as we journey on towards our marriage.

Kindest Regards,

Orlando was absolutely amazing. First and foremost, super knowledgeable and personable. Took care in getting to know us and was a great example of true customer service. Offered beverages immediately upon entering the store. All other employees acknowledged us and said hello. We felt extremely welcome and taken care of. No pressure on where and what to look at. Listened to our needs and offered help appropriately. Orlando made the experience of engagement ring shopping so much fun, especially since it was our first time! It felt like he genuinely loves his career and we were excited to know about the family history of D&L. There seems to be so many perks in being their customer and we can't wait to come back as I know we will be well taken care of. Thank you again Orlando for making our experience unforgettable. We loved getting to celebrate with our favorite drinks as well :) Such a treat!<//Review>

Davidson & Licht Is a pleasure to work with. Especially Jeremiah, his knowledge about watches specifically (IWC & Rolex) is unrivaled. Not to mention the way he  and the rest of the store treated me. Felt like family. Thank you so much! I definitely just became a lifetime customer!</Review>

I’ve been shopping here for last 3 years and have purchased all my favorite pieces from this place. Very unpretentious - I had started at Tiffany’s just down the street but they refused to clean any jewelry not purchased at their store -  ‘a liability’ they said. Well, tens of thousands of $$ later, I hope they rethought their liability insurance. Too late for me. I love my new store!</Text>

When I was ready to buy a watch, I did my research and went to check out an Omega and five Rolex authorized dealers. After spending time with the people at each store, my wife and I made the easy decision to come back to Jeremiah Aguiao at Davidson & Licht.

Jeremiah is very knowledgeable about the Rolex line and gave us all the information we needed without any pressure.  He always treated us as if we were the most important customer he had. His expertise and professionalism made it easy for us to order my new time piece from him. When it arrived (earlier than he promised) he excitedly called us to say it was in the store. We also had my wife’s Rolex and my old Omega serviced there.

We highly recommend you pay a visit to Jeremiah and his team at Davidson & Licht when you are in the market for a luxury time piece.</review>

<review>I have visited D&L multiple times to find unique pieces for my girlfriend and have always been treated like family when I am there. The energy and expertise is always appreciated. The quality is not only in the product they sell it’s also the people assisting in picking the right piece!<//review></record></dataset><record>
<text>Davidson & Licht is an amazing place to get the special forever piece of jewelry.   Mary has been a great partner when working through the special details of a particular piece of jewelry.   She takes the time to get to know you so the your final piece is perfect for you.    This is the only jeweler I use for not only new pieces but also revising old jewelry into new pieces which carry more meaning.< /text>< date>

<text>I recently purchased a Rolex and the quality of service you receive is extremely professional. The products are high quality and never a doubt in my mind that they value your business like family.

If you are in need of a timepiece or fine piece of jewelry, go to D&L.<//text></record>

<review>I had a very nice watch that also has a lot of sentimental value that wasn't working. I was nervous searching for the right place to have it serviced. Davidson and Licht has the finest timepieces in the world in their showroom so I knew right away they would take care of my watch. The service was 5 star at every moment.

Bought my first watch from here (3rd total in collection) and it was great experience. I never felt pressured to buy, and the staff were knowledgable and were happy to let me try on whatever my heart desires even if I knew I would not be buying the higher end pieces. Overall landed on a Tudor and I am happy with the experience and watch. Thanks guys!< /text>

<Text>Bought several Rolex watches from here and just recently picked up another hot watch on the market, the green Submariner aka the Hulk.

I thought I might have to wait another 3 months to get this watch but this morning I received unexpected phone call from Jeremiah and said the watch I have been waiting for is available for me to pick up.

Thank you, Jeremiah for fulfilling my wishlist a lot sooner than expected. I am extremely happy with the new purchase and the service you provided.< /Text>< resp>

You find a place that  Is supposed to have a 5 star rating.You go there because they have one in stock to purchase it and the only person that seems to be intrested in you is the security guard. Me  and my wife stood at the rolex counter for 20 minutes. The salesman must be pay by the hour because if they were on commission that's one sale I wouldn't want to miss.

Since 2004 I have had the pleasure of doing business with this local legacy. Their staff is comprised of consummate professionals and has exceeded all expectations particularly surrounding service on my previous purchase, and expertise with new and pre-owned luxury brand watches. I’ve also been fortunate to have worked with the same individual throughout the past 15 years. I highly recommend this fine establishment.< /text>

You must stop by if you're shopping for any kind of jewelry or watch. Their prices are comparable to anywhere else and, most importantly, their quality and service is far better than what you will find anywhere else. I went Davidson & Licht while looking around for an engagement ring and had the best experience you could ask for. Orlando was an amazing help and never once felt like I was being sold or talked into anything, unlike almost every other shop I went into while looking for the perfect ring. It felt more like I as being helped by a friend that only wanted to help me get exactly what I was looking for. During one of my visits I was even helped by the one of the owners, Jon Licht, and he was extremely nice and so happy to help with all the questions. Everything from start to finish was as easy and relaxed as possible and my fiancé has the most beautiful engagement ring and we both couldn't be happier.<//Text>

You must stop by if you're shopping for any kind of jewelry or watch. Their prices are comparable to anywhere else and, most importantly, their quality and service is far better than what you will find anywhere else. I went Davidson & Licht while looking around for an engagement ring and had the best experience you could ask for. Orlando was an amazing help and never once felt like I was being sold or talked into anything, unlike almost every other shop I went into while looking for the perfect ring. It felt more like I as being helped by a friend that only wanted to help me get exactly what I was looking for. During one of my visits I was even helped by the one of the owners, Jon Licht, and he was extremely nice and so happy to help with all the questions. Everything from start to finish was as easy and relaxed as possible and my fiancé has the most beautiful engagement ring and we both couldn't be happier.<//Text>

<review>I have gone to Davidson and Licht for years now. This is the best jewelry store that I know in the bay area. They take care of all their customers and they know you by name. I will never be going to a  different jewelry store.  I am glad that I went to them my first time ever going to a jewelry store.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Davidson & Licht is the best Jewelry store in Walnut Creek when it comes to fine jewelry, watches and customer service.  Jeremiah and Mary always greet us with a smile and they both go above and beyond to accommodate our jewelry needs.  Jeremiah has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to Rolex Watches.< /Text>

<Review>I have been visiting Davidson & Licht for several years now and I absolutely LOVE the people there. I am always greeted with a smile and the feeling is so warm and inviting from everyone who works there, it's like a big family. Although the store on Broadway Plaza was very nice, I have to admit I think the new store on Main St. is absolutely gorgeous! I was blown away the first time I walked in to see the huge selection and beautiful architecture of the store. It's truly an experience to browse and try on all the exquisite jewelry, you can just get lost in there. If you are looking to escape for a little while and feel and be treated like a princess, shop at Davidson & Licht, you will never go anywhere else!<//Review>< pictures>

Ruslana was fabulous! She listened to me and gave great suggestions. I wasn't planning to buy today, but Davidson & Licht has a generous return and exchange policy. AND as a member of the LGBTQ community, I didn't feel judged AT ALL (and they are in the heart of Walnut Creek!) D&L are officially my go-to jeweler.<//text>

I gotta give a shoutout to Ruslana! Just absolutely amazing service. Story: I was in a time crunch for an engagement ring and had to have it in 30 days. And from start to finish she absolutely took care of me. From helping me picking out the diamond to the band and then going out of her way to make sure I received it in time for my proposal (and being in constant contact with me with updates)...she is literally, absolutely, unequivocally the BEST!!! Oh and the quality of the final product...unmatched. Wife loves it so much!< /Text>

<rating>5< /rating><review>I have been visiting Davidson & Licht for several years now and I absolutely LOVE the people there. I am always greeted with a smile and the feeling is so warm and inviting from everyone who works there, it's like a big family. Although the store on Broadway Plaza was very nice, I have to admit I think the new store on Main St. is absolutely gorgeous! I was blown away the first time I walked in to see the huge selection and beautiful architecture of the store. It's truly an experience to browse and try on all the exquisite jewelry, you can just get lost in there. If you are looking to escape for a little while and feel and be treated like a princess, shop at Davidson & Licht, you will never go anywhere else!< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I have been a loyal customer of the Walnut Creek store since the mid-90s, perhaps earlier, and have missed shopping there since having moved out of state.  When my wife and I visited the new store on a recent visit, we discussed the possibility of upgrading her wedding ring with Jon Licht.  We ultimately decided on a wonderful band and beautiful center diamond from his extensive inventory.  However, the ring needed some customization.  We left it in Jon's capable hands and a month later, received an exquisite and beautiful ring, which exceeded our expectations.  Over the years, we have found the employees to be very friendly, knowledgeable, and the brands carried upscale and reasonably priced for the quality.  I highly recommend this jewelry store and visit it every time we're back in the area.< /Review>

I have known Jon and shopped at Davidson and Licht for over 24 years. In that time both he and his staff have been exceptional in terms of service but also as far as the jewelry lines that they carry. He helped my wife and i custom design various pieces as well as show us designers that he knew that she would like. I have rarely met anyone in the retail business who is as attentive to his customers as Jon is.
There is nowhere else that I would go for purchasing jewelry then his store.<//review>

<Text>My wife & I have been customers for several years now. Our experience with the owner and his sales staff have always been pleasant & friendly. I firmly believe in getting what you pay for. This store gives it's customers their full attention. Whether it's watches or jewelry, they know their products!!! Most customers who go to high end stores like this already have an idea of what they are looking for. The professional sales people here only help the customer make an informed decision of what they want to purchase. Never felt pushy or condescending (as some reviewers had written).  First experience with them was a simple watch battery change, now we are customers for life.</Text>< Pics>

Jeremiah was a great salesperson and a true pro. He knows his watches, movements as well as dial finishing. I would heartily recommend him for any watch purchase (and a signet ring purchase, too)l Once Baselworld is over and I see what new Rolex watches come out, I'll be back. Thanks, Jeremiah!<//text>

<review>5 stars is an understatement when reviewing Davidson & Licht. Not only do they sell only the highest quality diamonds, but their customer services is unmatched. It is almost as if when you buy a piece of jewelry from them you become a part of their family. I have never experienced customer service to this level. When walking through the door I am greeted and welcomed by every person in the store. The jewelry I bought will last for generations to come, and will never think of going to another jeweler. They stand by their jewelry, and when walking through Walnut Creek, they are always happy to clean and service my jewelry at no charge, making it look exactly like the first day I purchased it. I am a customer for life, and look forward to many more purchases in the future. 100 stars.<//review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

Jeremiah and Ruslana are absolutely delightful!  I've been annoying Jeremiah for the last 2 years now and he never made me felt like I was unworthy of his time like other high-end jewellers.  He was always patient and helpful.  I finally made some purchases with more to come.</text>

This gem in downtown Walnut Creek is a must-visit for anyone looking to add a piece of exquisite beauty and quality to their collection.  The staff is exceptional, both from a customer service standpoint and knowledge of product.  From the moment you walk in, you sense the pride and professionalism of the staff and the warm and welcoming atmosphere.  From fine watches, to engagement rings, to gorgeous diamonds, Davidson & Licht has it all and takes great care in your experience and satisfaction as a customer.  Highly recommend!</Text>

Jason and John are the best in their trade! They are confident in their selection for their customers and gentle with their approach.  I never feel pressured or like they are trying to up-sell me. I am very specific when it comes to my taste in jewelry.  I love classic and timeless and D&L displays my exact taste, while carrying contemporary pieces that are very unique and not commonly worn by every other woman in these parts.  I have an appreciation and respect for small businesses and will continue to patronize D&L for their customer service, knowledge and family ownership.< /Review>

I just visited the new store in Walnut Creek. What a fabulous place. I have always found the staff to be very professional and helpful and they did not disappoint once again. Davidson and Licht has all the best brands of watches and fine jewelry. I did also see some of the most creative collections I have ever seen including a new brand of Diamond Mosaics called Pleve'. Each piece is unique and made by an artist so that was really a fresh new concept!<//Review>

Convenient location and a great store. I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase from Davidson Licht!  Jason was great to work with and very attentive to our needs.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a engagement ring or any type of jewelry!<//text>

<Review>My husband and I love D&L.  We are treated like family every time we walk through the door, from the doorman to the owner himself, John.  We have purchased several pieces and all have been of the highest quality.  August has helped us with each purchase and we are always amazed with his depth of knowledge and pleased with his level of professionalism.  He continuously goes out of his way to accommodate us from providing historical appraisals to making sure that we have that exceptional piece for anniversaries or special occasions.</Review><date>1481149077605< /date>< user_id>

I used to feel intimidated by the fancy facade/decor of this place, but that disappeared the moment I went in for a second opinion for the repair of my engagement ring. The entire staff have such warm, friendly and genuine personalities, so I felt instantly at ease the moment I walked in. The doormen always remember you and are equally as kind and welcoming. I'm so happy that I went in because they fixed my ring for a fraction of the price as a nearby competitor, and offer to clean my other jewelry while I wait every time I'm in. The free parking in back is a true bonus. I really like how I didn't feel rushed or passed over simply because I went in for a small repair and wasn't spending much at all. This kind of true customer service not only wins my trust, but it also warns my respect. Very well done, D&L!</text>

This is my second purchase here. Jon Licht knew exactly what I was looking for the moment we met. We found a superb engagement ring.  Never was pushy or rushing me into buying. There is a reason why you come here, it's the QUALITY, the VALUE, the SERVICE, the GUARANTEE you pay for. Highly recommend Jon light and his team, you won't regret there expertise and professionalism!< /text>

My wife and I decided to pop into Davidson & Licht to have her ring inspected while waiting for a dinner reservation. Even though we didn't buy it there, they were happy to clean it and made sure the diamond was secure. They were extremely warm and welcoming, making us feel right at home. Not sure when my next jewelry purchase will be but I'll definitely be stopping by Davidson & Licht.< /review>

Davidson & Licht’s new store is amazing! I came to look for a graduation gift for my sister and the staff was super friendly and helped me find lots of great items within my budget. They even offered to clean my jewelry while I shopped! I’ll definitely be sending my boyfriend here when we start ring shopping.<//Text>

Beautiful store.   We also went there for the Walnut Creek Halloween Trick or Treating--they appear to be pillars of the community.  The doorman was SO sweet to my kids--TRUST ME!  that means a lot!   I think it says a lot about a store and when they care about the city and the people in it.     Bonus: they also have a goldsmith, watchmaker, and gemologist on site!   That can be handy!< /Review>

I work in downtown Walnut Creek and finally decided to check out the new D&L store after passing by many times. Even though I was just in jeans and a t-shirt, the doorman was super friendly and I was quickly greeted by a nice salesperson. I told them I just wanted to browse, and they offered me some water and candy while I looked around. Overall, great experience, beautiful store and friendly salespeople. I'll probably drop in again for my girlfriends' birthday.</Review>

<Text>In an age where customer service has blown out the retail window there is still one store that understands the definition.  From the moment you walk through the door you are treated the way locally owned businesses used to treat their customers.  You are greeted with a genuine smile, offered water and candy (I know….I was shocked too!) as they learn about what you are looking for and how they can help (Thank you for not pressure selling me!).  The employees have all worked there for a long time which speaks to not only their knowledge of fine jewelry but also to the fact it must be a great place to work.  I am also impressed that the owner is always working at the store.  To me that speaks to his drive for a quality experience buying a quality piece of jewelry (wow…that sounded like I work for them, but honestly I can’t explain it better).  Davidson & Licht not only has the best selection of Rolex watches in the Bay area, they have the best shopping experience (finally a store that gets it).  This store reminds me why it is so important to support local businesses that still care about the customer and not a bottom-line.<//Text>< gmapID>

I have been a customer at Davidson & Licht since 2007. The customer service is impeccable. The selection of jewelry and watches are so good. I have personally bought several watches as well as many of my friends there. The new location is awesome and stunning. This is what a jewelry store should be and look like. Kudos to the staff especially Jeremiah. He really knows the products.<//Text>

In one word: fantastic! I have been to quite a few jewelers in my 57 years, and Davidson & Licht, by a long shot, have the right mix of professionalism, friendliness, and honesty. I have taken my beloved Rolex watch, which I have worn every day for 30 years, numerous times to have links taken out & put back in, water damage repaired (my fault!), and a broken crystal replaced (again, my fault!). I have received service above and beyond one's imagination. In fact, we were so happy with Davidson & Licht and my watch, that my husband bought the male version of the same watch, and he, too, is very satisfied with his purchase. I'll end my review with one final word: integrity.</text>

I love all my shopping experiences at Davidson & Licht.  They are very personable, knowledgeable and most of all honest!  One of the things I love about them is that they don't try and sell you, they listen to you and really find the perfect item for you.  Their inventory is extensive from the classic styles to high fashion pieces.  And what can I say about their diamonds  WOW!!!!!  DAVIDSON & LICHT  is the perfect Jewelry Store, I highly recommend them.</Review>

Came in with my fiancé not really knowing what to expect. Wanted to just look around and was actually planning on purchasing elsewhere. Was very impressed with the salesperson's knowledge and patience while we looked around. While the price was slightly higher than some of the online vendors we were looking at, we decided to buy both our diamond and setting from here.  We knew we could go back to them with any issues and just had a great experience working with them, would absolutely recommend to anyone looking.<//Text>

<text>I have always had a great experience shopping at Davidson & Licht and working with their sales staff. They are so welcoming and knowledgeable about the jewelry and I feel confident about every single purchase because I know if I ever have a problem they will take care of me. They really do have outstanding customer service.

But! I recently popped in to see the new location and I am now INCREDIBLY impressed. The space is luxurious and their new designer jewelry is beautiful! I had such a great time walking around & trying things on & I fell in love with the Pleve collection! I couldn't believe how unique and interesting this mosaic jewelry is - definitely not something you see in other jewelry stores around here & that's why Davidson & Licht is so special.</text>< pics>

I have been hearing for months about the new Davidson & Licht Jewelry store on Main Street in Walnut Creek  and finally had the opportunity to see how amazingly beautiful and breathtaking it is. How special it was to be greeted by their courteous doorman before entering the store, and then  treated to refreshments before starting my shopping experience. The service and expertise is only surpassed by how comfortable the salespeople made me feel while trying to decide what I could and could not buy that day ( at least 20 pieces pop into my head as I write this review).< /text>

The staff is very friendly and the service is great. We got to meet a lot of the family members, and worked closely with the owner's son, Jason. Especially becasue we designed a custom band for my fiance, there was some initial anxiety on how things would turn out, but the entire process was very smooth and a lot of fun, and we love the result!<//text><Rate>5</Rate><name>Jason Badger< /name><Gmap_id>0x808561c3cc99e1b1:0x6a8a963fec593186<//Gmap_id>< Time>

<text>Upon a recent trip to Walnut Creek I decided to stop into Davidson & Licht to buy a gift for my girlfriend since they carried her favorite designer Todd Reed.  Not only did they have a broad and nice collection of his work, they also had Panerai and Rolex watches for me to take a peek at as well!  From start to finish my experience at the store was top notch.  The team was professional and knowledgeable on the numerous questions I had about the jewelry and watches.  Definitely worth a trip to check out this store!< /text>< pictures>

I have been going into Davidson and Licht for several years now and the staff has always been very warm and welcoming.  On my last visit I went into the new location on Main Street which is stunning!  Not only do they have a great selection of jewelry and watches, the store really knows how to provide great customer service.  Looking forward to visiting again soon!<//Text>

Beautiful new store with plenty of light to see the jewelry.  The staff was friendly and knowledgeable and spent plenty of time with us even though we were just looking.  Never felt pressured.  Cozy bar area in back.  Will definitely return.</Text>

<Review>I love going here.  The new location is amazing. Stop by just to see the new location and how it is set up!  Inside they have a great selection of jewelry. The owner is usually around the store and very friendly. He seems to be in this business quite awhile and is very very knowledgeable. I always go back to his store first when considering a jewelry purchase. What really makes the place special is his attention to your needs.  If you need a gift for an anniversary, birthday, holiday, or just for fun they can find the perfect item to make that special someone happy.
Finally their James Bond watches and the Breitling Commercial for watches are awesome. Gorgeous P51 and  F4F.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x808561c3cc99e1b1:0x6a8a963fec593186<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Davidson and Licht set the standard for jewelry shopping in the Bay Area.  From its excellent and knowledgeable staff, to their quality pieces of jewelry, to their beautiful building, nothing is less than first rate.  The staff was incredibly helpful when I went to pick out my wife's 21st birthday present.  I would recommend this place to anyone.< /review>

< review>
Ruslana is AWESOME! Went to her for our engagement ring. We had been to a few other places and found that many shops had diverse options, and looking back at it now that my fiancée and I are engaged a huge reason we came back to D&L was due to the service provided my Ruslana. She took her time knowing how important of a decision this was. She went above and beyond and also eliminated so much for the stress factor with me considering my fiancée left me with 3 on her “wish list.” Ruslana was there to confirm that the one I thought she liked the most was correct. She is now like our/my own personal jeweler, I go to her for holiday gifts and will be going back for our wedding band.we even decided to invite her to our wedding when the time comes.  Great place and Ruslana is an amazing resource for anyone looking at engagement rings as a couple or in secret. Highly recommend  reaching out to her for advice anytime me or my fiancée aren’t working with her!<//review>

Davidson and Licht set the standard for jewelry shopping in the Bay Area.  From its excellent and knowledgeable staff, to their quality pieces of jewelry, to their beautiful building, nothing is less than first rate.  The staff was incredibly helpful when I went to pick out my wife's 21st birthday present.  I would recommend this place to anyone.<//text>

This is a beautiful store! My boyfriend was in the other day looking at watches and he was very impressed with their selection. They also have an on-site goldsmith and watchmaker- and even gave my bf a tour of their service rooms upstairs. I know this is the place to go for all of my jewelry needs, from a watch service to ring redesign, necklaces, bracelets and diamonds or even a Rolex for the bf!</text>

I was having dinner with some friends in the area and happened to stop by Davidson & Licht to check it out… this store is beautiful! The doorman greeted us and we were offered some water and candy while we browsed their jewelry collections (I definitely found a few items for the wish list). I’m sure I’ll be stopping by again soon - they even have a goldsmith and watchmaker upstairs.<//text>

<Text>On our 5th Wedding Anniversary I decided to surprise my wife with something exquisite. I got her a pair of Mikimoto pearls since she is a beach lover and since she loved to wear her little black dress.

I spoke with Mary of Davidson and Licht and she helped me decide what to get for my sweetheart particularly the size. I described to her my wife's preferences and took Mary's advice for that perfect luxurious pearls.

My wife was so happy the moment she received her anniversary present and she totally loved it. She wears it all the time at work, special events and it made her look more feminine.

Thank You Davidson and Licht for the great customer service and for catering my need. Quality Service,quality product for a special life event.

I guess it's true "Happy Wife, Happy Life"

I went into Davidson Licht's only to have my too tight wedding ring removed. The staff greeted me at the door with champagne, guided me to a comfortable chair, and relieved my sore finger of it's too-tight band. You would have thought that I had announced the intent to spend lots of money on jewels! Thanks so much to everyone for their attention and kindness.<//text>

<text>My husband treated me with a necklace and engagement ring from Davidson & Licht, and my experience with them has been consistently excellent for over 10 years. As the years pass and my jewelry is still so enchantingly beautiful, the quality of the pieces becomes more apparent. Recently, I needed a repair and re-sizing for my engagement ring, and I returned to the store to pick up my ring today. The doorman remembered me and warmly welcomed me back, and I was immediately approached with a courteous, calm and professional spirit… precisely the experience I've had with every single visit to Davidson & Licht. I was regaled (as I've always been) by the pristinely captivating, yet embracingly comfortable ambience. My ring was impeccably repaired. The employees were sophisticated, attentive and thorough. I am so pleased with the outcome of repairing my sweet engagement ring… a piece of jewelry that is so precious to me!!</text>< resp>

I have had the pleasure of dealing with Davidson & Licht for over 30 years.  From their small store in Broadway Plaza to the beautiful showrooms that they have built on Main St., their attention to their customers has never changed.  If you go in more than twice they remember who you are and what you last purchased.  The sales personnel are knowledgeable, friendly and tactful.  The owner is a really down to earth gentleman that is always interested in stopping for a brief chat if he is in the store.

In the last thirty years I have gone in for everything from getting a new battery for a watch, having a mangle ring fixed to buying diamonds and pearls. There is no job too small or too large for their on site jeweler to tackle.

When you go in be prepared to remove all your jewelry for cleaning (free of charge of course) and they always offer you refreshments as soon as you walk in.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I have been to the old store in the Broadway Plaza and was completely blown away by their new location! This is a grand building; from the staircase, skylight and even vines growing up the sides of the entrance, it was very impressive. A few of my friends are watch collectors so I decided to check out their Panerai and Breitling selections. They definitely have a large collection and their watch guy really knew his stuff. They even have their own in-house watchmaker. I’ll definitely be coming back when I’m ready to pull the trigger.</Text>< pics>

Davidson & Licht are most certainly a 5 star jewelry and fine watch store. They have an amazing collection of luxury time pieces and they are the exclusive dealers in the in the East Bay area for Bremont watches. The high-end exclusive watches on show speaks volumes about the store, and to compliment this the staff are very friendly, helpful, and extremely knowledgable about their products and their industry. Every time I visit I have a wonderful time and I am very well looked after. It's always a pleasure to spend time with the Davidson & Licht team.<//text>

<text>I bounce from the east to the west coast quite often, and have my 'favorite' stores on both ends.   The newest addition to my west coast loves is Davidson & Licht.  The design of the Walnut Creek store is absolutely breathtaking.  I was greeted warmly and  throughout my visit the staff was incredible.  I was also introduced to a new brand, Italian designer Roberto Demeglio.

The designs are cutting edge and BONUS every piece is stretchable along with double BONUS a lifetime warranty!  The rings I can wear on any finger and the bracelets slide on easily so no help is needed.  Beautifully crafted with ceramic, gold and diamonds, these are my new go to accessories for all seasons and on both coasts.

THANK YOU EVERYONE @ DAVIDSON & LICHT!  <3<//text>< Time>

I was strolling down the street of Walnut Creek to window shop for jewelry and finally decided to stop by in Davidson&Licht. At first  was very hesitant because their new place looks so grand and fancy and I was just wearing my basic Summer shorts flip Flops and tank top.Anyway,When I step in the entrance,Charlie the door man greeted mě and mind you he has a very pleasing personality.While browsing, a very warm, professional good looking gentle man asked on how can he help me. It was Mr. Jon Licht the owner of Davidson&Licht he helped mě decide on what diamond cut,size,my birth stone and etc. should I have in my tiny little finger. He is very well knowledgeable and even I haven't purchase anything yet He offered mě to clean my jewelries.I feel very privilege meeting him and the Rest of the staff. If you want class and quality,i highly recommend D&L.  They are superb,sophisticated,high end and many more. I couldn't wait for my next visit and have my diamonds,and speaking of diamonds,the clarity of theirs are flawless. They also carry mikimoto, rolex,hearts on fire and a lot more. You will really feel ať home and will be taken care of. Moře Power D&L< /Text>

Nice store but wow , the staff is so rude!! They seem to really judge you when you walk in the door! Someone should let these people know that those with real wealth don't feel the need to flaunt it ! They should maybe a little kinder to the busy moms and dads from lamorinda!<//Review>

<review>My fiancé proposed to me about a month ago with the most stunning ring, from Davidson & Licht. When he proposed, the diamond was set in a beautiful white gold presentation band. We went to Davidson & Licht to change out the band to platinum as well as look at wedding bands. During my experience, I worked closely with Vince. Vince was able to show me several different bands. I am very indecisive and was taking forever to make up my mind, but Vince assured me that I could take as much time as I wanted. I never felt rushed and was able to really think about what I wanted while talking through it with Vince. When he noticed that none of the bands I saw were “the one,” he offered to replicate my presentation band in a platinum version. I was elated and did just that.

I returned a week later to have the band switched out when it arrived. This time I was helped by Mr. Licht, his son Jason and Vince. While having my ring set, I was given espresso and water while they walked me around to different areas of the store to look at band options. They thoroughly educated me on the different metals for men’s wedding bands and how they differ both good and bad. They were able to guide me in the right direction and arrive at a decision. Once that was done, they began walking me through my band and went through my Pinterest with me to get ideas of what I was looking for. And once again, they thoroughly explained the pros and cons of the band style that I had selected and offered similar variations that would be more resilient in the years to come. When I was finally able to arrive at a decision, they were able to write up a quote for the order. As if that wasn’t enough, I then had Vince show me necklace options for my wedding. When I briefly explained an idea of what I was looking for, he immediately pointed a necklace out to me that was absolutely perfect.

The experience I had both times was outstanding. I could take as long as I wanted and could ask as many questions as I had. They were informative, incredibly friendly, and most importantly professional. I look forward to my quarterly visits for ring cleaning as it’s always a pleasure to visit. I highly recommend Davidson & Licht for anyone looking for quality paired with a great jeweler relationship. I wish I could give them 6 stars...</review>< Name>

< Review>
The new Davidson and Licht store in Walnut Creek is "the" place to shop for luxury watches and jewelry brands in the East Bay. The selection is amazing and the associates are knowledgeable, professional, and make your shopping experience fun and memorable.  They showcase the largest selection of Mikimoto pearls in the East Bay, my favorite!  And not only the fabulous basics of Mikimoto but the one of a kind jewelry designs and South Sea pearl strands. Contemporary and elegant.  They also have an amazing selection of Rolex, Panerai, and another favorite of mine, Cartier.  Everyone should stop by and when you find the design of your dreams, you will enjoy the celebration with the friendly staff when they open a bottle of champagne.  Enjoy!</Review>

<review>It is rare to find a high end jeweler that makes you feel at ease along with having impeccable  customer service. This jeweler has the best selection of diamond jewelry, designer jewelry and watches. I purchased several watches from Davidson and Licht and have been impressed with the top notch customer service they provide from start to finish. But it doesn't stop there - they ensure your investment is taken care of for years after purchasing your watch. That's why I keep coming back. The staff is extremely knowledgable and are experts in providing the best advice for whatever you're looking for. Be it designer diamonds, a Rolex, Brietling or a newer up and coming watch line such as Bremont. They will help you find the best one for you and I promise you'll be back. Jeremiah is stellar and a true expert at helping you choose the best watch for you. I love the watches he helped me pick out. I highly recommend Davidson and Licht to anyone in market for fine jewelry and watches.<//review>< pics>

<Name>Lucas Soltero</Name><Text>I heard of Davidson & Licht from a friend of mine. I wanted to get my parents original wedding rings resized, so they can have them for their 50th anniversary. It was short notice so I took them in, the staff was more than helpful and they were knowledgeable. It only took a couple of days to get resized they reset the loose diamonds and cleaned everything for me. The rings came out perfect the first time and my parents couldn't have been happier.< /Text>< Time>

Your experience begins with a nice greeting from the door man who will offer to put change in the meter for you. It is always nice to have free parking (back of the store - you just have to ring the bell) Immediately I was greeted by Vince and he became my personal shopping helper. I came in for earrings, specifically the harts on fire collection. The stones are cut so perfectly the light that's comes back out of the diamond shines like no other. You can look through the scope and see how perfectly symmetrical the diamonds are. They are the best cut diamonds in the world, and "Cut" is the most important of the four C's. I was drawn to the 1ct. pair and tried them on. I was sold.
The next day I came back and Vince immediately greeted me again. I wanted to be sure I made the right choice. I tried on a larger more expensive pair and he said they both work but the smaller ones are perfect for everyday wear. He suggested I keep the ones I got. I really appreciated that he didn't up-sell me. Turns out they don't work on commission, how amazing is that; I feel like I can breath unlike at other jewelry stores. Vince made great conversation during the whole experience. He offered to appraise the alexandrite ring I brought in for free. He had me examine my stone with a loop (10x magnifier) and I mentioned that I wish I had one. He helped me out with that too. This has been such a wonderful experience and it gets better! He also steam cleaned my old earrings and new ones. A free service with unlimited visits. I started to talk to Vince about my favorite watch brand Breitling and I asked him to show me some. He brought me over to the section and he pulled out one of the versions I was interested in. Wow, it was beautiful. I just had to get it. In a flash it was on my wrist and fully registered with a 5 yr warranty. He advised me to come in every year or two to get the pressure checked, again free of charge. I brought up a watch winder and he said I'm glad you brought that up, we have a few store models from a vender. He showed me how to use it and put it in my bag. Are you kidding me! It seriously keeps getting better! And Vince was absolutely the best, I would give him a million stars! This jewelry store is by far the best I've ever been in. The cleanliness, the free beverage and snack, the amazing customer service. I would recommend this place to everyone, absolutely the best service you can get. Good buy Tiffany, good buy everywhere else. This is now my go-to jewelry store and look out for Vince. They are all excellent, he is just my personal favorite.< /Review>

<Review>I've been buying watches for over 19 years at Davison & Licht and most of these years working exclusively with Jeremiah.  Not only is he a walking Rolex and Panerai encyclopedia as well an overall watch expect, but he is a pleasure to do business with.  He knows and remembers his clients likes and taste and never disappoints.  Jeremiah is extremley professional and doesn't rush or pressure you with making a purchase. He's very patient explaining as much or little as you might want to know about a watch.

There are other non-authorized places to purchases watches on the internet nowadays, but I choose to buy from Jeremiah, he really turns what would otherwise just be another average purchase into a whole positive experience.

If I had to single out one specific part of the follow up service I appreciate the most, it would have to be there annual no charge Rolex refinishing, it's like getting a new watch ever year without spending any money...it's really one of the best value added follow up purchases I've seen in this industry.< /Review>< gmap_id>

<Time>1409468022023</Time><Rate>5</Rate><text>My wife and I have always been treated well here, even when we were "just looking". We bought a Rolex a number of years ago at their other Walnut Creek location. A few weeks ago we needed to have the band adjusted so we came back. To our surprise it wasn't there. We googled it and walked to the new location.

The new store is beautiful! We walked in with jeans and tennis shoes. We were immediately greeted and helped. While we waited we looked at their large selection of Rolexes. We met Jon Licht, the owner and Jeremiah, the in-house Rolex expert. We learned so much from him about the history of Rolex. Jon has a great sense of humor and gift of gab. We bought two Rolexes! While we were looking they offered to clean our rings and our watches. They cleaned and polished them for free.

We spoke with Jon about our 25th anniversary next year and our desire to have rings made for the special occasion. He put a $100K ring on my wife and walked away. Then I wore it walking around the store. When Jon came back we discussed different possible designs.

We were treated as if we were part of his family. We were not dressed well. We were not wearing a lot of expensive jewelry. We are gay. Sometimes other stores do not give us the time of day, so we just leave and find another store who will treat us with respect. We did not feel this way any time we entered this store.

I highly recommend shopping here.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808561c3cc99e1b1:0x6a8a963fec593186<//GmapID></record>

Excellent detailed service.
Jeramiah and Jake were outstanding in going over procedures.
Owner Mr. Licht very personal. A nice touch when owners are involved and active. All staff spot on and sharp.
Very impressed with all aspects of their operation.
Product, service and facility.
Well done!!<//Text>
