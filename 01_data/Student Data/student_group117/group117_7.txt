<Review>I had originally planned on having the four tires on my vehicle to be replaced at my local Costco Tire Center in Antioch, but unfortunately that deal went south quite quickly.
So I decided to try America's Tire in Brentwood to see if they could try to match Costco's invoice price that was quoted, they didn't just match them they beat their price. The same tires and service.  The Customer Service at this facility was outstanding,  the quality and selection of products was impressive.  I have found a better place in the future to shop for my Tire replacement.<//Review>< date>

Since closing the Antioch store, it took me awhile to go ahead and try the Brentwood location. Glad I did. I'm completely impressed! Super fast and honest. Friendly and knowledgeable employees with great customer service.  Bring your cell phone with QR scanner for even faster check in! 😊< /Text>

Great service from Alex and Mark. I have past experience buying tires here as well and they were always great. Go here instead of Big O Tires which are crooked and always causes damage to my car and for some reason gives 400.estimates to fix each time something different but always around 400.So go to America's Tire instead.They seem more honest,and reasonable in prices and fixed my tire with a nail for free even though tire was not from them. Good place.< /text>

I purchased a set of tires from this location and I was very pleased. They changed my 4 tires and swapped out my old spare tire for one of the better tires that I was having replaced on my truck quickly. The staff was courteous and friendly. I will definitely be returning in the future for my tire needs 👍🏽</Review>

They are truly honest people and give their professional and personal opinions on their products and services. They saved me a ton of money and have a great price promise guarantee. They took two nails out of my tire that the dealership said was irreparable. The dealership wanted me to buy new tires, but after taking it to America's Tire, they found that they both were merely within the tread of the tire and easily pulled out with no complications. Mercedes sent me on my way with 2 nails in my tread to continue to drive on them, getting deeper and deeper, while America's Tire took them out with no issues.. AND this service to repair is FREE. And they did a complimentary inspection on the rest of my tires and sent me on my way. I'm back, 2 weeks later due to sidewall damage to purchase a set with them... never again at the dealership. They truly are AMERICA'S BEST TIRE SHOP ♡ thanks again to such a great team of people. Excited for my new set tomorrow once they get the order in.<//review>< time>

<review>The service of the actual install and work was great, however I ended up waiting 2 hours simply because someone forgot to call me when my vehicle was completed!! I called the store once it hit the 2 hour mark and some guy said "oh yeah, your cars been done for a while now" yet I never received a call... Such a waste of time. Not returning to this store.< /review>< GmapID>

Made appointment last week to have tire rotated and balanced. I went in,  they asked for my keys and I waited inside in a very cool building ,since it was too warm for me,and I waited til they finished ,  I was was out in less than 30 minutes.. People there pretty professional and answer questions you may have.  I been coming here since I moved here 10 years ago. They always took care of my tire needs.</Review>

Avoid this place. Even though they have lower prices, their customer service is severely lacking. So much so, I will happily pay a higher cost to get better customer service. Sadly, like others, over the years I have remained a loyal customer of this location by purchasing multiple sets of tires for the multiple vehicles I own (4). I will not be returning.  When I want my tires rotated, as offered as a free service, they should rotate my tires. They SHOULD NOT give me a policy section why they can't do it or claim it's a concern for my safety. I am the customer! Just provide the service. But at this location they will not. They deny the service to pressure you into buying new tires.  I will eventually be purchasing new tires soon but not from Americas Tire. Plus, this isn't the first time I've had an issue with the customer service at this location but, in good faith, I gave them a second, and a third chance.<//Text>

America’s Tire is the Nordstrom’s of Tire Companies. Every single time I come here I receive exceptional customer service. It’s disappointing other companies do not operate with excellence.<//Text>

Came here to get tires unmounted and tires mounted on a new wheel but damaged both wheels while demounting.
One of my new tires is leaking so i went back to the store that installed and said i have a pinhole on the beadseal.
They claimed they have nothing to do with it and can't do anything about the tire.
Most likely ripped a beadseal off that spot and using the pinhole as a excuse.
Everytime i come here something gets damaged and scratched even when you used the best employee.Says alot about this store.<//Text>

<Review>2 sets of tires at American,  my Goodyear tire developed a bubble on the sidewall at 5000 miles.  They wouldn't even cover a manufacturer defect.  Goodyear will reimburse AT but they charged me 80.00 for the replacement tire.This is the only tire store that sells insurance so you're not saving any money.  I'll never go back.< /Review></record>

**1st timer** Made an appointment to install new tires on my Mom's car. Dropped it off with a 1 hour "promised by time" and went for a pizza over at MOD. Came back and found out that they only had 3 of the 4 tires they promised me, so they installed the next best tire (extra 10,000 mile treadwear warranty) at no extra charge, and it was ready to go. Excellent service!
(*edit*) forgot to mention that they extended their "cyber Monday" offer to me, and a technician helped me fill it out during delivery. 5-1/2 stars ✨ 8f I could. 👍</Review>

<review>Very quick and professional. Manager Dan evaluated the problem right away and his team of technicians helped me with a slow leak issue. I was afraid of them damaging the paint finish on my wheel but they were skilled enough to fix it without any damage!! I'm definitely coming back here whenever I need anything tire related; definitely a positive experience.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Response>None<//Response><Review>I stopped by here in a pinch yesterday as I felt one of my wheels was imbalanced after rotating them in the morning. I pulled the wheel off and asked them to balance it really quickly as I was out and about with my kids and have a lot of driving planned for the weekend. They did this for me quickly and painlessly and I had my wheel back on and was back on the road in like 10 mins. They were booked the rest of the day but took a few short minutes to take care of me and didn't even bother to ask if I'd bought my tires from them (which I did). Above and beyond customer service right there, something that's hard to find these days. Thanks guys!<//Review>< user_id>

I waited 3 hours for them to even take a look at my flat tire, to tell me they couldn't repair it. You are more interested in sales, than in customer service. Free rotations and service mean nothing. Flats happen and there should be a dedicated employee to address these immediately. An appmt was not possible. Very disappointed. Would not recommend purchasing tires from this location.< /Review>< Pics>

Well I've been a customer for over a year now, & I've never had a bad experience. Every visit had been top notch service. One of my visits I dozed off to sleep from working the night before. While they worked on my car, they gently woke me to tell me my car was all ready. They went over everything they did, & if I understood & if I had any ?'s. Thank you for such great service guys 😘< /Review>

Usually a wait but they price match and usually will give you a discount on something. And the $80 insurance has come in handy a few times when I've gotten flats. They will either repair or replace the tire.<//Text>

Very disappointed this time.

Fortunately I was not in a bind to get a slow leak fixed so the only thing wasted was my time. I knew(and was told) I would have to wait because I didn’t have an appointment, and the next available appointment was three days from now. That doesn’t work for me. I waited as long as I could, and other customers with flat repairs came and left due to the wait time while I waited. In short, if I can’t get a random leaky tire repaired in less than two hours and have to go somewhere else to get it done, I’ll likely buy my next set of tires there too.</text>

Came here twice. First time was about a month ago, I came for a flat tire repair and boy was I shocked when I was told there was no cost for the repair. I told the folks here that I didn't buy the tires from them and they said it doesn't matter.  In the process of fixing one of my tires, they discovered another tire had a nail and went ahead and fixed it too (at no cost).  Last week, I wanted to replace my tire before my road trip and of course I came here. The guy took a look at my tires and was very honest in suggesting just to replace the rear ones as the front ones still got good life on them. Had both my rear tires replaced and out of there in about 30 minutes.  Prices here are very competitive (I think they were about $0.05 cents more) excellent service and professionalism by everyone here, I will be a repeat customer.< /review>

<review>I arrived at America's Tires in Brentwood at 7:45 hoping to have my car tires rotated and balanced. There were 2 men in front of me At 8:00 am sharp, the door was opened and 5 service agents greeted each customer. It was so refreshing to receive smiling and welcoming faces!
I had the pleasure of seeing Zach. He asked how he could help me; I asked if I could get a tire rotation. I was waiting to hear that I needed an appointment or that I would have to come back later in the day.
Zach said I will get you right in and asked for my car keys! He invited me to sit inside while he pulled my car to the shop.
I saw several agents speaking with customers. Each was kind, respectful and focused on all their customers.
Within 20 minutes Ryan called my name and approached me saying my car was ready!
Ryan drove my car out and with a great smile said have a great day.
I was home in 10 minutes. My entire journey from home to America' s Tires was less than an hour.
I highly recommend this establishment for their outstanding customer service. I felt respected as a customer and confident that my tire rotation was completed properly and safely.
I will return after 4000 miles to this Brentwood location.</review>< userid>

<text>I purchased the warranty on my tires through them, which I HIGHLY recommend, and needed to have a replacement. The tire was completely covered and only paid $8 for coverage on the new one. Exceptional service from the representative zack. He was quick with the process and polite. Would recommend an appt at this location for they do get busy but are quick.</text>< pics>

Not really sure what another reviewer said about a "hustle". I bought two good quality tires, they were mounted and balanced and ready to go in an HOUR and for a great price. I was pretty impressed with the free repair they did a few days later when one of my two old tires started to go flat.
The guys here are always professional, friendly and personable. They're very helpful with any and all questions and concerns. I won't be going anywhere else for tires. Excellent customer service is very hard to come by these days.< /Text>

<text>The customer service is top notch.  I recently visited for a tire rotation.  After it was finished, honestly a few days later, I noticed my center cap to my run was missing on my back driver side rim.  I called them and they never once questioned the circumstances.  They immediately ordered a replacement cap and called next day to let me know it was already in.  I arrived and they had me out of there within 5 minutes with a new free center cap.  Never questioned my claim and just did the right thing.  I am now a forever customer.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<review>American tires is very costly and a quote for 2 fires was 45 dollars each but came out to a total of 140. I might as well buy the tires myself and put them on there. They also do not know any good places to get your car serviced. They gave me a number for a guy who can fix transmissions but he was so rude I had to hang up. Also the wait is very long, but at least the workers are nice and respectful<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I've become a regular here because of the service. A good example would be something as simple as getting my tire pressure checked and adjusted. Any other place I've stopped by and requested this to be done and you're made to feel like, "Serious? We're busy selling tires here. Let me see if I can find somebody to do this".
At America's Tires its being told to pull my truck up to the first bay and there is usually somebody on it in less than a minute. All very polite and friendly employees.</text>

I had an interview that day and brought my car in with a flat tire afraid that it wouldn't be able to be fixed in time. The service tech Zach made sure my car was taken care of as quickly as possible,  so I could make it on time to my interview.<//review>

<text>Good service, but I had to wait 2 hrs. Time is precious to me. This chain has a location in Antioch as well,  close to Somersville and had never taken me more than 30 min. I recommend it, if you are not willing to wait 2 hrs in the Brentwood one.< /text>< Name>

< Review>
Great service and an outstanding price.  Went first to Big O and then to America's Tire.  America's Tire, for 4 tires, was $151. less.  The tire quote was for the same tire (BF Goodrich 255 R16 99W).</Review>

Ok, got new tires and rims on Craigslist for my truck and they needed balance so I went to a competitor since he was able to do this on a Sunday and he even gave me a discount. Instead of $40 he charged $35.  But when asked about the sensors in the rim, he explained that they wouldn't work with out pulling mine out of the original wheels.  I was reluctant to do the time sake and monies.   Two days later I went and saw Lorenzo at America's Tire Company and he programed the sensors on the new wheels to my truck and we didn't have to pull the old ones from my original wheels - and no charge....<//text>

<Response>None<//Response><text>I wanted to make sure you all here about a great experience as it seems most internet reviews seem to be negative.
I have been a regular customer for many years and have always had a very fair price and great service with all of the America’s Tire branches. I am a sales rep so I drive about 30,000 miles a year so every 2-3 years I’m back spending my hard earned dollars here. I moved to Antioch, CA in late 2009 and found the Americas tire closest to me was this one in Brentwood. I have always been taken care of whether it is a new set of tires, a rotation, or a flat repair. This store has a great staff that get me in and out as quickly as possible. Yes, this store is BUSY and I am a patient man.
I wanted to send out a special note and thanks to SEAN TRADER, the assistant manager. He is  very knowledgeable and suggests the best new tires for me. I was disappointed with my last tire purchase of Continental’s that only lasted 47,000 miles with a 90,000 mile warranty. Of course, Sean applied the proper pro-rating and suggested the newest from Michelin. He really knows was to suggest when I ask for things like “quiet ride” and “long mileage”. I feel confident with his suggestion.
The independent Consumer magazine test I read said the Continentals were #2. The Michelin Defenders were #1. I did not care for the noise from the harder compound. That’s why I chose the Continentals. When Sean told me the details of the new Michelin HR’s I was sold. These have an 80,000 mile rating so I’ll see you again before that. Hopefully, at or beyond that.< /text><Time>1510617439732</Time><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

It was last Saturday when we went to this supermarket to buy foods and others for the preparation for my daughter's birthday. The staff at this place was very helpful that we shop there conveniently. It was all organized!< /Review>

<Text>Mira Mesa Marketplace is a cool place to check it out. I like the area.  People around there are nice.  Parking there can be a little tricky because it can get crowded.  There are plenty of places to eat and shop at. The Old Navy is located there, a book store and plently more shops.  Also there's a movie theater.</Text><resp>None</resp>< Rating>

It's not the associate, it's the schedules these guys are on or not on.  You guys need to over lap lunches I'm the returns. I stood there in pain with hip and shin inflammation and couldn't find a place to sit so I had to hold the makeshift wall up.  Overall, never a problem with any  Home Depot associates, they are always professionals😊👍<//review><userid>108302295708561687842</userid><Resp>None< /Resp>< pics>

< Review>
So glad I found this cafe in downtown Covina. My order was ready in about 15 minutes and due to covid, they brought it out to my car. I ordered the kids pancakes, kids french toast and a protein sandwich...all were amazing! My kids are picky eaters and loved every bite. The fruit was fresh and food was flavorful and well portioned. The little note on the bag was also a nice touch. My kids said this is our new go to breakfast spot.<//Review>

<Text>Great cozy comfortable place. All freshly made dishes. The food is awesome and they do make fresh pastries during the week. Plenty of parking in area. I've been here twice and enjoyed  the restaurant both times. The breakfast sandwiches are great. The pancakes are awesome.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMeEjiH2kIUKK98s0PN7nT7z_7s-fOhYmKjEiK-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNHcSYKQEWCTz3zCcQj2r6J1Xg14NZIQCxAKz5V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMHSQb4sXMTaWLzCcfSNTFwnmssXl_l3TZiW17M=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPb04LxXOoygk_5WV4Zxi7kTbjKPbtMpovpHeww=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNnATsLXk4c4SOssmGtTMhSp8wBnHNml1djKeqg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoFKkQQsLGwO_4l4Y3SH8EGnN_A5iXrM7Wtwvi=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< resp>

It's a small business but everything shouts BIG. Customer service is excellent.  You are asked if you're eating in or if you're ordering to go. Eating in, you are seated promptly, asked if you want something to drink. You're given ample time to review the menu. Excellent choices. Order is taken and food is brought out in a timely manner. Food is delicious and ample. Love this place. I will be back.</review>

Which can all be attributed to one waitress, long brown hair ponytail, we understand this is a small local cafe, we knew it was busy, so we were fine waiting, however the waitress was in a terrible mood, made sure to ignore us, we saw 4 parties that came after us get their food first before we did.. we waited 2hrs to be able to eat, during that time we saw this waitress tell new customers coming in that "they were overwhelmed at the moment and could not take them" a bit rudely in my opinion but make that judgement for yourself, she was just trying to empty the place out, which we did see, as we waited for our food, it was a lot of little things, to much to go over honestly, we were patient and trying to make the best of it since it was my mom's birthday and i wanted to take her here because I love the food, it's a nice little local place, but I have never seen such a rude waitress. Anyways,  try going on weekday maybe when it's not so busy, or trying to get some extra help in there, but I just figured the owner would not appreciate her sending paying customers out the door. It was not one incidence, she did this multiple times. If she can't take the pressure of a packed restaurant, then maybe she needs to find something different to make some cash.</Text><user>112394952773921468420</user>< Pictures>

I absolutely love this place.  It's a little hidden place off Citrus.  It's quaint,  relaxing,  and the food is very good.  I especially love their chai tea latte - delicious!  Service is friendly.</Text>

Hidden treasure. The atmosphere was very tranquil and the food was delish. Enjoyed stuffed french toast, an egg scramble and great coffee. A must try. Will be taking the 47 mile drive to eat here again. So worth it.< /review>

Yours and Mine is one of the brightest spots in the Eastern SGV’s breakfast choices. While their youth as a restaurant can lead to longer waits, the menu more than makes up for this sure-to-be-improved challenge. From the fluffiest pancakes in town, to the excellent scrambles and the fine lunch options, Yours and Mine has scrumptious food that tastes fresh and inviting. Don’t miss the sign on the door for the specials because the pumpkin pancakes were a revelation and the omelette variations have also proved excellent. The pricing is solid, although combo options are not as clear. But the minor growing pains will pass and you will still get to indulge in some delicious creations at this charming spot.</Review>

And just went in today again and was totally reminded why I fell in love with it....the food is always just so fresh and so very well made. French toast is delicious and soft and perfevtpe balanced with freah fruit. The bagel sandwiches are just so damn mouthwatering and so good. Avocado is fresh ..onions are crisp... And I honestly don't even like tomatoes and they were so juicy and fresh that I loved them in my sandwich and couldn't get enough. I have never been so satisfied from breakfast spot. This place is my favorite. And the cute little tables, the music...the nice homey vibe is just so cute. Just go try this place.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Name>

<text>I really wanted to give this place a chance, I really did. The menu seemed interesting, the atmosphere was cozy, and I wanted to support our local small businesses. So we get there (party of four) and the one girl working (hostess/waitress/busser) told us she just needed to clear the tables and we'd get seated right away. I glance around and there is maybe three small families waiting/ sitting at their tables with unhappy faces (should of been a red flag) and I see there are five other EMPTY tables that just need to get plates picked up and wiped down. Okay I think, five minutes top.

FORTY minutes later we finally get seated, I honestly don't know why we hadn't left. But we are troopers and we continue to wait. Three other parties got seated at the same time we did, even though they arrived after us. Next, we are still waiting and ten more minutes and we get our menus. Waitress girl is all over the place, giving menu, taking orders,  serving drinks all out of order. Some one came in to order to go and left happily with their food. Yet I still don't know what demon possessed us but we are still waiting it out.

One hour and 20 minutes later we are barely getting two of the four coffees we ordered because they need to brew another pot. That's it last straw we storm out of there hungry, with headaches, questioning life. Absolute worst dining experience ever. They need either more help, or better train staff, the cook or owner even poked her head out a few times, she could of helped out and made things run smoother but didn't. Do not go here!< /text><rate>1<//rate><gmap_id>0x80c3285b3049022f:0x8d781a0d4b36483a<//gmap_id><response>{'time': 1518383036673, 'text': 'Hello Felipe...I first want to apologize for your experience at Yours & Mine yesterday.

< review>
Despite the complications of coordinating an international move from the UK during a global pandemic and Brexit, the Schumacher team did a great job at taking the stress and worry out of receiving my household goods. The Move Coordinator I worked with was fantastically communicative, taking the initiative to contact me with updates and information when she received it. The crew they sent to deliver my goods were polite, professional, and took great care when handling my things.

I've been impressed with Schumacher, and will use them again should I need such service in the future.</review>

<Text>Working with Schumacher to get my beautiful, 1970s vintage chairs from Paris to New York was a dream. In the age of COVID, when there are a million delays, things coming damaged, lost etc, these guys went above and beyond. They contacted me on a Tuesday and all of my chairs were delivered on a Thursday, and ON TIME! The window was 9 to 11, they came at 9 am sharp. The two deliver guys were incredibly thoughtful, polite and speedy. They carted all of the garbage away without me even asking. Their head of coordination was so responsive, I honestly couldn't believe I was dealing with a logistics company this efficient. I would strongly recommend Schumacher for any international shipments. Highly professional, efficient, communicative and most importantly thoughtful.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPsH8jNA5ew4JqEog3dCpCTc8HxprU_-ysAIKX9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< resp>

We moved from Denver, CO to Sydney Australia in Sept 2020. Mark Neville was unresponsive when the packers came to pack our house in 1 day instead of 2. They packed, food, medication and anything that wasn't nailed down. Because we sold our house and were moving overseas, we could not reschedule.
As a result, we had to find a place to stay the night, buy and extra suitcase and pay excess baggage on 2 flights.
We did not get a response as to where our container was until we arrived in Sydney and emailed the CEO of Schumacher.
Once we finally got our boxes and furniture in Sydney, furniture was damaged, a large part of my dishes and glasses were all broken, items were bent. The packaging was incompetence and damage was due to their negligence.
We were suppose to have an entire container and we are missing a part of our sectional sofa, 1 box of kitchen items and things from random boxes were missing and incorrectly labeled.
Shumachers response was pathetic - they don't care.
I would never recommend this company !</review>

<Date>1602030592129< /Date><Text>Schumacher Cargo Logistics personnel and staff were highly professional, very courteous, and incredibly helpful from the moment my furniture arrived in New York from France. As I was away when my furniture reached New York, storage was set up in New Jersey until I was back in New York City two months later. I will state emphatically that every one at Schumacher Logistics, whether in California or in New Jersey, demonstrated extreme professionalism and courtesy. The different departments of the company were in contact with me on a regular basis, they guided me so that I could obtain the necessary Certificates of Insurance required for the delivery, and they immediately set up a date for the delivery. The movers arrived promptly as scheduled, delivery was quick and efficient, the whole process was carried out smoothly and without stress, and the furniture, once unpacked,  was in its original condition. I recommend very highly Schumacher Cargo Logistics to anyone needing to move personal belongings internationally.<//Text><Rate>5< /Rate>< resp>

Special thanks to Schumacher Logistics USA and Allied Pickfords Australia for exceeding my expectations.  Their professionalism, ongoing communications, and packing/delivery expertise made for a seamless trans-Pacific household move.  Not one broken item! I would highly recommend their services and would not hesitate to engage them again.</review>

<Review>It was my first time moving from Us to France.
After few estimates, I wanted to share my great experience with Schumacher Cargo, had the opportunity to work with Jennifer Rabotin, she was so patient regarding all the process, (I called so many times before taking my decision), she answered to all my questions, and she was so efficient.

I was pretty happy with this new experience and her precious support, it was a pleasure to work with her team as well.

Her team was curtois, attentive and thorough.
I highly recommend their services.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp><Rating>5<//Rating><Gmap_id>0x80c2ca6c29ff06c9:0x1f0f2b8571378b1f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I have now been waiting a total of 5 months for delivery of a shipment of household goods from the US to the UK.  The shipment was first sent through southeast Asia (the long way around) and now is apparently in Singapore.  The company has not made any credible explanation as to: a) why the shipment was sent the long way around or b) the reasons for continued delays to the itinerary c) what can be done to assure delivery, or d) where the shipment is actually located at this time.  At this point, it seems unlikely that I will ever see the shipment again.  Do not send anything of any value.</Review>

The estimate, logistics, planning and pricing was all completely explained and we understood every step of our move. The team that packed our stuff was polite, professional and were clearly concerned with insuring that everything would arrive safely. The delivery was the mirror image, in so far as they demonstrated the same care and professionalism , but this time in unpacking! Though I never want to move so far again, if I do would definitely use Schumacher Cargo again.<//review>< pics>

<Text>I am shipping my MINI Cooper to Southampton UK. Just a little car but it means the world to me. Everyone has been so helpful to plan this trip. Since it was the first time to ship, they were all patient with me and my many questions. Mollie and Jake in Savannah process the car in 30 minutes for shipping and their service confirmed I selected the best company to ship my car. Many thanks for everyone's help.</Text><userid>113998851195947640085<//userid>< name>

Thank you to Atlas and Schumacher Cargo for getting my personal belongings from Utrecht, NL to Des Moines, IA. The packing team was absolutely amazing. The shipping from Rotterdam to NY went quickly and  customs clearance went perfectly smoothly. Finally, the ground transportation to DSM and into my new home went perfectly well even though that happened in the middle of a snow storm. Thank you<//review>

<rating>1</rating><text>I've worked with Schumacher twice on our shipping container move over to Denmark and back.
The first time, moving to Denmark, there were a few off things, mostly about keeping us on the loop, informing us of the milestones, delays, etc., Especially bad was the performance of their subsidiary in Germany to deliver our furniture after being stalled for 4 weeks in Hamburg. They refused to deliver in Christmas so we had no furniture for one week. Schumacher did not manage their German 3rd party.
On our way back, we decided to give feedback to Schumacher about the previous experience and work again with them, to simplify things and hoping that the feedback would improve the experience. It got worse. Our container left Denmark on Nov-11th and stayed sitting in a warehouse in Hamburg until Christmas. When I followed up, they said they would try to put it on a vessel on Jan-8th. After that, we were unlucky to be inspected by German customs (not Schumacher fault). When they finally put our container on Jan-27, we learned that a vessel departs every Monday towards the Americas.
The ordeal did not end there, the vessel has arrived on Feb-20th (12 weeks later, when they commit to deliver door to door between 8 and 10 weeks) and now they've sent us a $3k custom inspection invoice with a one liner description that says: Inspection.
Not only haven't we been informed or cared for during the whole process but on top of the extra costs this is involving for us in additional Airbnb + rental furniture expenses, now they send us a $3K bill without explanation, context of justification. They really have no shame.

I would work with someone else if you're going to ship your stuff overseas. I made the mistake twice< /text>< Pictures>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>MUST READ.  The complaint involves a damaged vehicle, numerous missing household items (The estimated value of the items that turned up missing is approximately $10,150.00), and excessive fees (above 60% of original quote) which were not disclosed by Schumacher Cargo & Logistics Inc. I was charged an additional $4,698 fee for services provided by Hamburg Sud Singapore Express (Voyage 004E). I was never informed that a separate transport fee was to be charged for transport services by Hamburg Sud. Although, it was one 40-foot overseas exclusive freight container, Schumacher Cargo & Logistics, Inc., created two different invoices (HBLs) LGB007286 and LGB007288.  However, they did not notify us that by creating two different invoices, this would consequently affect us because we would incur duplicate charges for one 40-foot freight container at each port of inspection to its final destination, Valencia, Spain. On January 30, 2020, we received an email message our container was picked by US Customs for a random inspection. However, on February 5, 2020, we received another email we were required to pay the amount of $146.46 USD for a "release charge by mistake".  We contacted Schumacher Cargo Logistics, Inc. by phone and email requesting an explanation for this additional charge.  They never replied by phone nor email but we only received threats indicating that if we did not pay this additional amount, they would leave our items at the present port and not continue to ship our items to its destination.  The only reply by Schumacher Cargo & Logistics was "shipment On Hold". At the present time, we do not know why Schumacher Cargo Logistics, Inc., charged us for this amount because they never had the courtesy to return our calls and emails. Furthermore, on March 11, 2020, they billed us for additional charges of $4,698 USD ($2588.40 and $2,110) for CUSTOMS INSPECTION AND DEMURRAGE HAMBURG SUD (CARRIER) FEES.  Similarly, I called and emailed Schumacher Cargo Logistics to inquire of these additional charges.  The only reply was threats on their behalf that if we did not pay the additional fees our belongings would not arrive to the destination. Consequently, due to the coronavirus travel restrictions, we were unable to pick up the shipment until September 26, 2020. Henceforth, we were required to pay storage ($4,331.17) starting March 25, 2020, to the date when the container arrived to its destination-Valencia, Spain. After travel restrictions were lifted, we were finally able to pick up our shipment at the storage site.  Upon taking inventory of the items, the following items were missing.  In addition to the missing items, one of vehicles was damaged.  The BMW passenger mirror was broken and the door paint, dented, and scratched.
Nevertheless, on October 8, 2020, we received an email reply from the following sales representative:
"Hello, I have emailed the warehouse staff in Gardena I
hope they will reply soon about missing cargo."
Kind Regards,
Ron Turnage - Sales Representative, Automobile Shipping
Up to the present time we have not heard back from anyone in Gardena or any other Schumacher Cargo Logistics, Inc. office. As has been noted, Schumacher Cargo Logistics, Inc., charged us an additional $5,245 USD from the original quote of $3,115.00 USD--60% more than the original quote. This amount does not include additional $4367.67 for unloading, taxes, customs, storage, and duplicate billing for one 40-foot exclusive container of which two HBL invoices (LGB77286 and LGB77288) were paid to Sparber Líneas Marítimas in Spain. In addition, we had to pay an additional $1,100 USD for a storage space for the missing cargo never arrived to its destination. Total expenses and hidden costs $29,647 dollars</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Tried to get a price quote based on an ad in which Schumacher claims to provide global shipment services for importing motorcycles.  When asked via telephone if they do in fact provide such services, their representative seemed confused, and admitted that all they do is move furniture for families, and do not handle shipping from India, Africa, or South America (location of three factories) where the bikes are made.  Advice to Schumacher:  stop claiming you do stuff that you don’t.  That wastes customer’s time.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>My family has used Schumacher logistics twice now and one of those times being in the middle of the Global Pandemic lockdown. I can't begin to describe the level of timely service they provide and the open communication throughout the whole process. When we have the opportunity to move overseas again we will certainly be utilizing their services. I think it is their broad reach of trusted partnerships throughout the globe that help them give such a high quality experience.</Review><Rating>5< /Rating>< Pictures>

We used Schumacher in November 2019 to move some items from NY to Ireland. It was a sort of test run because we planned to move the bulk of our home to Ireland eventually. The few items  (including a cast iron and enamel sink) made it intact and within the timeline we were given.
The pandemic hit and we put our NYC home on the market. It sold, so we called Schumacher again and scheduled a move for September 2020. This time it was the full contents of our house, including loads of art and an upright piano.
The salesman, Chris Licalsi, did a virtual walkthrough and gave us an estimate which included adding our storage space to the total. The price was fair and within the market rate, so we decided to go with them based on our previous positive experience. Chris was totally honest and transparent both times we used Schumacher. His affable manner and patience was  assuring.
The movers were scheduled to take 4 days to pack and load our home and our storage locker. The crew, Charles M, Luis D, Lito H, and Joseph K were exceptional. They packed our possessions with great care, crated the piano and a glass table top, repacked most of the contents of our storage container in order to make them more secure for sea travel. Finally, they loaded the shipment onto the overseas container, closed up the container and we took photos of the secured  shipment and the numbered lock. We received the detailed inventory list as a pdf, and the timetable for arrival in Ireland was set. The container arrived on time with no hassle.
The receiving moving company in Ireland were equally helpful. They handled the paperwork and customs and walked us through the process. The dispatcher sent a crew of eight men and two shuttle vans. Our house is in the countryside and a shipping container would never get close to the house. The container was unloaded within three hours and all furniture placed and reassembled.
We were able to completely unpack within a month of arrival and not a single item was damaged or lost.
I highly recommend Schumacher for any overseas household moves.</Text>

I used schumacher for a move from New York to Melbourne, Australia. They had the best price out of all the companies I looked for, and what seemed like the best service.
I was in touch with a few different agents throughout the move. It was all pretty straight forward, my goods took roughly 3 months to arrive.
No complaints, would use them again.</review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Schumacher handled my shipment from the UK once it arrived in the USA.  They kept me informed of the progress and requirements of customs and the employees were great.;  very friendly and professional.  My only complaint is they say your delivery will be made by a massive truck, that I doubt will fit on many residential streets, and that if they use a smaller truck for a shuttle there would be a minimum fee of $350.
My shipment was one small crate so that cost would have been ridiculous.  They agreed to ship it from the port by other means because I said we would unpack it ourselves.  They were very accommodating in this case but don’t know about other situations.</Text>< Pictures>

<date>1600195454746</date><Rating>1< /Rating><review>I used Schumacher for shipping household goods and my car from Germany to Missouri. Household goods started out rocky. When my belongings were surveyed they greatly underestimated. On pack out day I had over double what was estimated. I ended up having to leave a lot of things out of the shipment. Looking back I could have completely gotten rid of all my families clothes and our kitchen things and buy higher end stuff for the price difference instead of shipping it. They did renegotiate a better rate for me, but I budgeted for a certain amount and I understand a little overage, but my stuff was grossly underestimated.   After that I didn't have any problems with the household goods part. A Representative kept me updated on that move and even called to make sure the contracted company that delivered my stuff had contacted me.
Now, the auto side is a different story. They were super nice and responsive while getting the quote. The local company they contracted to pick up my car was horrible and it wasn't until the day before pick up, I had an actual pick up date. I was moving out of the country so this was super stressful. Then they would not give me a time frame they would pick my car up. Again, super stressful. I found out at 1500 in the afternoon that they would pick up around 1800 that night. Since they could not give me a time frame I had to arrange a pick up closer to my work and not where I was staying all last minute.
Once my car set sail, I had to practically beg for information. Customer service is non existent! After several weeks I would ask about my car only to get short replies, "We don't have a driver." That was it.
My car cleared customs in the US July 20th(I am writing this Sept. 15) and is still sitting on a lot awaiting to be transported to me. Oh, and after all this they tell me Missouri, right on I-44, is a hard place to deliver too. That might be true, I think its an excuse, but no one bothered to provide this information before.
I understand the impact COVID has had on transportation, I do, BUT I could have had my car last week, but Schumacher did not pay some sort of lot fee and the lot would not release my car to the driver!! I find it hard to believe a shipper as experienced as Schaumacher claims to be did not know this ahead of time. Was my car the first car to ever be at this port or lot or whatever it is?  They did not reach out to explain what happened I had to call, only to not have my call returned, and then email to find out what happened a couple days later. They told me the same driver would be taking the same route the next week. Its is passed the next week and no car or explanation as to what happened again.  All of this frustration and the one star review is entirely preventable with good customer service in your auto shipping department. It seems reading all the reviews now this is a common problem with this company. Shame on me, should have read reviews. I will not be using this company again.<//review>< pictures>

I had an excellent moving experience with Schumacher Cargo Logistics. Arpad Egei liaised with me from the time they received the shipment until it reached me. He was very supportive and helpful and incredibly compassionate about the stress of moving overseas. My goods were delivered in good order, on time and the delivery driver unloaded and checked each box. I can highly recommend their service and would not hesitate to use them again.< /text>

< Review>
I used their service to move from New York to Frankfurt Germany. Price is a bit high but worth the money. The coordinator manager Eugene is very friendly and responsive; the packing team came on time, get the job done within an hour and wrapped everything quickly and professionally. They really know what to do with china, glasses, paintings etc.
Items arrived in time and no damage.
Excellent follow up customer service too.<//Review>

Awful experience overall; poor professionalism and customer service. The Company has poor values and definitively not customer oriented.

They try to rip me off with additional costs over a "Door to door" agreed and signed contract for an international move, where I'm totally aligned to and within contract boundaries.

This in addition to:
1. no engagement AT ALL from any of their agents unless you reach out first (every time I had to ask where all my furniture was).
2. their system sent an automated email "We'll contact you in 3-5 days for delivery time" after US Customs clearance and then agents 'forgot' to follow up; when I contacted them 2 weeks after I was told a bunch of lies. In fact, my stuff got "magically unblocked" 24h after. What a coincidence.
3. once I finally got contacted for the delivery, I was initially told to wait another month, which was the last drop I could take: like driving my stuff from Los Angeles to Seattle was going to take longer than a ship sailing half the planet from EU. Ridiculous for the few things I moved. It was simply too much.

Definitively NOT recommended at all.
And I'm not saying that, because of COVID-19, I kindly asked to be looked after because living in a totally empty space for months, in a Country you don't know, is tougher than anyone else. Which of course did not happen...< /Review>

< review>
I contracted Schumacher Cargo Logistics to ship my household effects (about 260 cubic feet) from San Jose, CA to Brisbane, Australia. They did a first class job from pickup at my apartment in San Jose to delivery to my storage cube in Brisbane.

Communication was excellent throughout (thank you Kimberly) and all my goods arrived safe and sound.

What you want when shipping your valuables overseas is a firm you can absolutely trust, because it will take a long time and there can be a significant variation between estimates and actual duration. It's a complicated procedure dealing with container ships from one side of the world to the other.

In my case, US customs decided to open the shared container which added a couple of weeks and resulted in an extra charge. This is stated on the contract, so be aware that it may happen to you.

You may find cheaper quotes out there, but check to see what they offer. The service Schumacher offers ($16 per cubic foot) is a full, door to door service.

It may seem a bit expensive but it is a very reliable service and they treat your valued possessions with care. At the end of the day, you want a shipper you can trust; the actual dollars are secondary.

I highly recommend Schumacher Cargo Logistics.

Regards,
Geoff</review>

<text>I planed to ship  my household good from San Diego, USA to Austria. I found Schumacher Cargo Logistics in Google.

Schumacher Cargo Logistic packed my shipment mid February to ship it right away. But because of COVID 19 my flight was cancelled, so I asked a very nice Gentleman VALERIO MARTELLI to hold the shipment which he did. Any time when I called him and I had questions, he was very nice, helpful and always friendly. He put my shipment in storage for about 4 months until I could be able to get a Flight to Austria.
Here in contacted me a very nice lady Julia Czirokova and she took care of the customs paperwork, On August 4th they delivered my shipment to my home also very nice delivery guys. Everything is here and in grate shape. I WILL RECOMEND
Schumacher Cargo Logistics ANY TIME.

THANK YOU ALL.

Terrible logistic company. Start to End is miserable.
CSM POV is this is what we are... Terrible to start with while booking. Shipments arrives in 13 weeks when 8 weeks were quoted. End of the day - shipment arrived with broken boxes... delay cost a lot. Compensation - ZERO. As others have reviewed, shouldn't have booked this company at first...
Already sent email to martyn choen and as mentioned response - "this is our service". no need to contact me if you don't have anything to compensate....
Unfortunately No: I have uploaded pictures below so it can confirm goods are not settled. Claim is separate story primary issue is delay. Rather then me calling I would expect your CS team to contact me on the email based on my previous emails.</text>

<Time>1587926583628<//Time><rate>1< /rate><text>I shipped a car to Finland from the Elizabeth New Jersey location after dealing with Christian Mager from the Los Angeles office.  I asked for an "all in" quote including port and customs work on both sides of the transaction.  Christian then sold me a bill of goods and kept piling on costs once he had my car and my money.
The original one month timeline turned into four.  The cost doubled.  There was no customs clearance in Finland and I spent hours and hours driving back and forth to the customs office when Schumacher sent me the incorrect paperwork. Christian was unresponsive, unhelpful, and the only solution he ever presented involved me paying even more money.
Run away from this company.  They are at best incompetent, and at worst, lying cheats.  I will never deal with this company again and you shouldn't either.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

I would highly recommend these guys and company. We had our precious shipment delivered from the UK to California, these guys were fantastic at communicating from the start and when they arrived, we talked everything through, they placed things where we wanted, moved things around for us, made zero mess, cleared up, fast efficient and just really respectable chaps. I'm not sure on comparison price of other firms but if you want a reliable, honest and careful team handling your goods I would definitely recommend. We will be using them to ship back or things to these UK.< /review>

I can't believe I gave them a single star. Three of our boxes went missing and they are denying a claim because the overseas agents didn't note any missing boxes. Well, the original manifest never made it to the overseas shipper. There was no tracking system as far as we could tell. Customer support ignored us for weeks. You should throw your belongings into the ocean instead of ship with them, because if you don't do it, they'll do it for, and they'll make sure you pay for the pleasure.

Edited to add: If you really were trying to improve your customer service you would reach out to me personally and attempt to resolve this matter. Not only did I lose items I needed and cared about, I was treated very very badly in the process. Accidents happen, but horrible service, not honoring an agreement that I paid for, and not tracking multiple boxes in any way shape or form are deliberate.</text>

Absolutely horrible service!

I transported my brand new motorcycle last year, when the bike had been received- the starter had been left on and therefore the battery was totally drained and needed the battery to be completely replaced.

Ron was my transport manager and he has strung me along for 8 months now - telling me that he is looking into this matter further. He had told me that their insurance covered the bike during transport, but so far has refused to reimburse me for the cost of the new battery. I'm pretty sure big deal federal investigations take less time than Ron is taking to look into my battery. Now he is not returning my emails.

RE SCHUMACHER'S REPLY:

You are correct that we had a scheduled call for that date, but Ron had missed our scheduled call time due to a sales meeting. I had also emailed him again on Dec 6, 2019 asking for an update and had never received a response.<//text>

<review>I had some large items which needed to be freighted from the USA to the Middle East.  Not being from the States and not knowing any US freight forwarders, it was a quick internet search, an email, and then a massive hope that things would go well.

There was a warm feeling straight away as the response from Schumacher was immediate and to the point.  My enquiry was distributed to the relevant dept and person, and we then had a constant and productive communication.

My equipment arrived, and I changed from sea freight to air freight.  That didn't phase Schumacher.  They immediately switched things around, and then once all sorted, the box was on a flight to Dubai.

There was an extra step which was actually more important than all so far - the handling of the freight in Dubai.  Schumacher stepped in again though, put me in contact with a local agent here, and all continued to run smooth!  Schumacher did all the behind-the-scenes liaison such that all I had to do was nominate the delivery address within Dubai and provide my residency documentation.

To say that this freight task was seamless and painless is an understatement.  And putting my money where my mouth is, I have another US-to-Dubai shipment on the horizon - using Schumacher is the only company that I'll be contacting!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< gmap_id>

< review>
This company will attempt to price gouge their customers at any opportunity. I used their service indirectly through an international shipping company in the UK and paid $1000 for door-to-door service at a normal ground floor address. After delivery I received an additional invoice for $350 for use of a completely unnecessary shuttle. The shipment was 20 boxes to my single family house and they decided it was easier and cheaper for them to use a small van and then charged me an additional $350 for the 'service'.

So Schumacher just replied replied to my review and apparently I can't respond to their reply directly so this edit to my review is my response.
There is plenty of space and normal access for an 18 wheeler in the urban development where I live. 18 wheelers are in and out regularly for moving furniture. Our driveway is wide and straight. $350 is a ridiculous price for a small van rental, I can rent a UHaul for $40. This is price gouging pure and simple.< /review>

We used Schumacher as they gave a great original experience when they acted as receiving agent receiving and delivering our goods from the UK some 30 years ago.

We decided, at short notice, to return to UK this Christmas(2018) and I contacted them to be our shipping agent.

Their staff moved very quickly to provide a quote which we found to be very competitive.

They came very quickly to pack and clear our house in the limited time frame we requested. Even when our plans hit a small road bump they worked with us to store our goods safely.

All that said our goods are now in the UK and everything made the move successfully including our pai tings and grand father clock! and their UK partners were also excellent in the customs handling and final delivery phases.

If any one is having to make an international move I would recommend them without reservation.< /text>

Had an absolute terrible experience.
Once they get the money to move a car overseas they will stop communication. No one replies to emails or phone calls. No idea where the car is even well beyond the promised transit time.
Then at some point you will receive a Bill of Landing automated email - of course half the information on there is wrong and port of discharge is a different one than originally booked.
I hope I will get my car at some point.

<pics>None< /pics><Name>Ingrid Smith< /Name><review>This company has the worst ethics in the business. Our classic vehicle was shipped from Australia to the USA. We paid for 'door-to-door" service. They charged 27% more than the closest competitor and we accepted it as they were supposed to be "the best in the business". The car was not blocked during the voyage and sustained damage. Once it arrived in port we were sent an invoice which included "admin fees'" and "messaging fees" - none of which could be explained. Then on the day the vehicle was to be delivered we were told (rudely!) that we had to pay an additional fee or the car would not be delivered. Extortion, pure and simple. We would NEVER recommend this company to anyone. The behaviour and unethical practices we have encountered will be reported to the California Department of Consumer Affairs.</review><UserId.>104795936423193323883<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<review>We moved our household from Idaho to England. Everything went smoothly from the move-out in May to the move-in in November. Furniture, kitchenware, and valuables were packed professionally, including our antique grandfather's clock and baby grand piano. Our goods were loaded onto the ship within a week and arrived in England within 6 weeks. Everything was placed into storage for four months until we could move into our new house. Upon unpacking, everything was in good condition with no damage to anything. Throughout the process, it was easy to contact the appropriate person through email, with all questions and concerns addressed.< /review>< pics>

It has been very frustrating so far. I used Schumager Cargo Logistics to move my household goods from USA to Manila. As advertised, they promised a door-to-door service without hidden fees. For my surprise, the local agent is asking me for 300 USD for the tax exemption. I contacted the East Coast office and they are refusing any accountability. It takes them days to respond and simply, I will not use them again or recommend them. I used Anglo Pacific in the UK to move my things from London to Manila without any hidden fees or issues.< /Text>

< Review>
My experience with Schumacher Cargo Logistics was wonderful. They explained clearly to me how packing and shipping were going to take place and everything went fine and in accordance with their description. It took a long time (2.5 months) for my shipment to travel from Texas to Italy because it was a relatively small one (ca. 20 boxes), but this was part of the deal and the reason why I was able to take advantage of their convenient rate for a shipment within 100 CFU and spend less money than paying for a 'regular' cargo on my own. In any case the price was worth the service. Schumacher Cargo Logistics staff was prompt not only in answering my questions but also in dealing with small glitches along the way. They allowed me to deliver some additional boxes to their warehouse after the main shipment was already there and reassemble it in order not to exceed the 100 CFU we agreed upon (and the related price). They helped me significantly with the paperwork required by European customs. They also covered some additional fees their European associated partner claimed after the shipment arrived in Rotterdam.
In conclusion, I strongly recommend their services to anyone moving from US to Europe.</Review>

The Schumacher Cargo team made our first international move (USA to New Zealand) a great experience. They did our quote and scheduled our move in less than a week, helped with all the paperwork, were reasonably priced and continued to communicate with us every step of the way. Our belongings were delivered in the same condition as on pick up; like they never left the house. Kimberly went above and beyond in helping us through any issues that arose. Great service overall.</Text>

<text>Unfortunately, I had a really bad experience with this company. First, I contacted Schumacher for a quotation to ship my car from Arizona to Saudi. The sale agent representative was nice and he replied really fast which was great. The estimation was $1850 from Arizona to Saudi. So, I decided to drive from Arizona to Long Beach California to minimize the cost to around $1150 as the agent told me. The agent told me that whatever I put inside the car will be for free. Surprisingly. After I dropped my car at the company in Long Beach, it was not easy to reach the representative agent again. Weeks later, they sent me the shipping invoice with the amount of $1840!! After reviewing the invoice, they charged for items inside the trunk! It was weird to me that the agent never clarified with me that whatever I put inside the trunk will be charged, but what will be inside the car is for free as the accountant told me, it doesn’t make any sense at all. I tried to contact the representative agent, but he never replied to my email. I did recommend this company to three of my friends who wanted to ship their cars to Saudi, but after my experience, I will strongly recommend them to think again about it especially after my experience. I do have the emails and the names of everyone for proofs.< /text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Very impressed and highly recommended Schumacher Cargo Logistics especially with Rachel Ulale's service, and of course  great help for us military soldiers. The process was very smooth. The conversation we had in Cali was exactly what happened here in American Samoa. She was very professional, resourceful, and very informative. Also gave very good tips in getting documents prepared to take to their agent here in Samoa. Also important to note is that she ALWAYS responded timely in my e-mails. I highly recommend to all military soldiers to seek her out when it's time to ship a vehicle, house hold goods etc...</Text>

<Review>I highly recommend this company for international shipping. A big thank you to Ariel Martinez for answering the many questions I had throughout the process of shipping my car from the U.S. to Europe. When my car arrived at the destination, I continued to receive great customer service. I was under a time crunch and my case was pushed to the forefront to insure I received my car at a certain time. Again, thank you Schumacher Cargo team.<//Review>< rating>

We used Schumacher for a move from Texas to Scotland. They were a bit pricier than the other quotes I got but they had good reviews and did a full service type move. I felt that it was worth paying a bit more for a company I had more trust in.

The pick up in Texas went very well. The crew was professional and did an excellent job packing everything, even though we did a lot of it for them by pre-packing our items into plastic bins. In the end, only 1 small item was broken and 2 things turned up bent.

It took awhile to get our things from Texas to port in New York; almost a month, which seemed slow to me.

To get them out to sea and into port in London was a reasonable 2 weeks. And then clearing customs took another 10 days, which was also reasonable.

However, getting the goods from London up to Scotland and then delivered to us took over 5 weeks. This was pretty absurd for such a small country as the UK. And we actually contacted the company ourselves after such a long time, they didn't call us first.

After all of that, I still would have reviewed Schumacher well. However, the 1 notable piece of furniture that we actually shipped over, a large office desk, was left in pieces upon delivery. The delivery team couldn't figure out how to reassemble it . Thus they gave up and just left us with all of the pieces.

I contacted everyone involved on the sales and management side and they agreed to have the delivery team come back out to assemble it. However, it's been a month since that was coordinated and they still haven't arranged me to take care of it.

I couldn't go any longer without a working home office so I had to spend my weekend figuring out how to put the desk back together. That's not what I paid several thousand dollars for.< /text>

It doesn't get much better than Schumacher Cargo Logistics. As someone who's used a few companies in this field over the years I can honestly say that the friendly service and most importantly quality of the service is second to none. An example is the way they pack vehicles for shipping, they put every bit of care possible into making sure it's perfect, very well protected and respected, we've never had one ounce of damage. Highly recommended.</review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>I communicated a lot of with the east and west cost offices. The shipping went fine and smooth the problem is the hidden fees (60% additional feed from the original shipping cost) and the biggest problem is that they will not disclose these fees even if you ask. They will simply ignore your questions as if there will be no fees then at the end you will get hit with all kinds of fees and will hold your goods until you pay.<//Review>< pictures>

As a company we can understand the frustration of receiving a bill for more than what you thought, however we do not have hidden fees, nor have we ever. We are very transparent when it comes to disclosing what is included in our final bill. For vehicles, our quotes and terms state that the amount does not include destination terminal handling fees or duties.\nFrom our quotations - "Taxes, duties, custom inspections, destination customs clearance, port charges, unloading or delivery services are not included in our quotation."\n\nOur sales reps also let clients know this ahead of time.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED – TOP COMPANY!

I have had the pleasure of using Schumacher Cargo for the past 7 years on several occasions now for international moves from/to Europe/US and back to Europe... I shipped with them both household goods as well as my car several times and each time, they don't cease to amaze me in a good way. I probably wouldn't have moved so many times across the ocean if I didn't have Schumacher Cargo to rely on! :)

I have only always dealt with Mr. Martyn Cohen and his professionalism, excellent superb service, precision and responsiveness is unparalleled. I always get an immediate response from him but today, he actually replied to all my questions at... 6:15am (!!!) local LA time, which left me at a loss of words! This is simply how they do business - they won't deliver anything but utmost perfection, care and actually human touch and understanding of their clients needs, concerns and yes, ever changing plans.

I don't think I could ever convey my gratitude to Martyn Cohen and Schumacher Team for making the most difficult and stressful event into such an easy smooth experience! Schumacher Cargo will make your move a breathe and you can embark on your adventure without worrying about your precious cargo! THANK YOU FROM YOUR MOST LOYAL CUSTOMER!

Best wishes,

A majority of shipments are not selected for inspection, and unfortunately yours was chosen. This type of inspection can happen to any shipment and with any shipping company. We dislike these as much as you because they cause such confusion leading our customers to thinking we're deceptive when we work hard to be honest with our customers.\n\nWe also want to affirm that there are no hidden fees at our company.\n-The insurance processing is clearly stated in both the invoice and the insurance documentation itself. At any point before shipment, you may choose to remove the insurance and you would not need to pay for this if so desired.\n\n-The customs examination is done by the US government and is random. Our company does not inflate or exaggerate these costs, and we provide everyone who is selected by examinations with their invoice from the CBP Centralized Examination Station. Customers can also call in and confirm the charges with US government to see that none of this happens because of something we do incorrectly.\n\n-We offer the ability to pay by card as a convenience with the 4%. Customers can also pay through cash, check, and wire transfer with no additional charge, though your bank may charge for the wire transfer. This is not hidden and the details are clearly on the invoice along with the other ways to pay.\n\nThank you so much for shipping your car with us and we hope that you one day choose to ship with us again despite what happened with the CBP.\n\nHere is the CBPs information if you would like further clarification:\nDomestic US:1-877-CBP-5511 (877-227-5511)\nInternational: 202-325-8000.\n\n-SCL Management"}<//response>

<Text>Stay away from Schumacher Cargo. I've never felt so deceived in my entire life.

I just moved back home and had to ship my car from California to Spain. I was given a quote for $1520 and paid in full when I dropped off my car with Schumacher Cargo. After TWO MONTHS of waiting for it to sail, they let me know that the container was halted by US Customs and want me to pay an EXTRA CHARGE of $743 or else they won't release my car.
I was NEVER told about US Customs inspections and had I known they were so expensive, I would have never shipped my car.
I stressed the need of going with the cheaper shipping method to my sales rep Kevin Lucarelli since I was on a very tight budget, and he never warned me about any such possible fees. I'm not shipping a Ferrari, it's actually a $13K car for which I'll have to pay total fees close to $3000.

Communication has been very difficult. Many of my emails were ignored and had to resend times and times over. If I asked 4 questions, I got 1 answered
Worst part is that out of all the shipping companies I talked to, they seemed to be the most trustful.

I feel completely scammed and ignored by Schumacher Cargo.

Here are the hidden fees I've come across:
- $75 for processing insurance documents
- $743 for customs exams (their fault, since they are the ones preparing the shipment and did something wrong that caused the container to get flagged for inspection)
- 4% of any invoice for paying with a credit card (ridiculous fees for a company operating internationally in 2018)
All these should be part of their business costs, and not something that honest customers who are going through the stressful process of moving overseas had to deal with.

I regret hiring Schumacher Cargo and now I can only hope I'll see my car again.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2ca6c29ff06c9:0x1f0f2b8571378b1f<//Gmap_id>< rating>

<Response>{'time': 1529014892327, 'text': "Hi Simone and Malcolm,\n\nWhen our moving crew arrived to pick up your goods, they could already tell that there was going to be a much greater amount of cubic feet than estimated. Our moving crew alerted us of this, so we called you with options on how to proceed because we did not want to pick your goods and make you feel like a hostage at all. You could had chosen to cancel at no cost to you or had us stop collecting goods once we reached your original estimate amount, but your decision was ultimately to pick up all the goods and move forward.\n\nNo other moving company would have even called to let you know about the volume discrepancy and offered the option to cancel; they would have picked up your goods irregardless. Other moving companies may have given you a lower quote initially, but that would have been for your estimated amount of goods. Give your revised amount of cubic feet to any of the other moving companies and you'll see that their quote will be wildly higher as well.\n\nWe gave an honest quote based on the estimate volume, but the amount of goods wasn't accurate. Even with that, we're all trying hard to figure out solutions to this discrepancy such as lowering your rate as much as we can or having you to take back goods until we get back to the estimate volume. You also haven't even received an updated quote and rate adjustment to reflect the higher volume, we only told you at the price at the rate you were quoted at. It has been one day since picking up your goods, so we sincerely ask for some time to formulate the next steps for you.\n\nThank you so much for working with us and we want you to be happy at the end of this process.\n\nSCL - Management"}< /Response><Review>We hired Schumacher to handle only the US portion of our international move as they were unable to provide door to door service in our particular case.

After giving them a detailed description of the three bedroom apartment's worth of goods we needed shipped, they gave us a quote and we moved forward, however there was an upset when our price increased by five times after they picked up our goods. It turns out their quote was for a much smaller volume than we had clearly described, perhaps because we described a three bedroom apartment instead of describing our goods in terms of cubic feet, so I advise prospective customers to know the exact volume they intend to ship in cubic feet to avoid these unpleasant surprises. We ultimately negotiated a middle ground in price increase, but are still paying much more than we had budgeted and wish we knew ahead of time to make sure everyone is on the same page in terms of volume.

All that said, Schumacher is an organized, professional company in an industry that can be rather disorganized and in many cases outright shady. We chose them based on their reputation and trust their competence.< /Review>< rating>

An update since previous posting. After having wired the additional fee for our customs inspection (we had 3 requests for payment within a 24 hour period) to add insult to injury we had to send the dispatcher a copy of the receipt we had received from their company as they were unable to locate it.

Fast forward 13 days later, we requested the name of the local transporter as well as contact details. Schumacher stated they couldn’t provide contact details but were willing to provided a name. One Google search later the result was a registered company with 1 truck and 2 employee. Professional??

18 hours ago we were advised our goods would be delivered today between 12.00 -4.00 pm. At 6.10 pm a u-haul truck arrived with several guys, I am astounded to say the least.

$65,000 worth of goods which excludes fine art of $60,000 (due to the insurance company parameters, We have a uhaul and some guys at a cost of $11,000. You decide.</text>< pictures>

< review>
Schumacher International Movers handled our move from Reno, NV to Brisbane, Australia.  I investigated other shipping companies before deciding upon the Schumacher firm, for the following reasons:  realistic estimate of charges, clear communication, and prior reviews.  Our agent, Mark Neville was able to thoroughly explain all the details and charges, and he, or one of his assistants were available whenever I had a new question, even weeks after the shipment departed the U.S.
The movers who packed our goods (including 2 motorcycles) were very competent and careful.  On the Australian side, the moving company that Schumacher contracted with was also very professional and competent.  I would have no problem recommending the Schumacher firm to family and friends.</review>

I recently used Schumacher Cargo Logistics to transport a vehicle from the UK to the US.  Being new to this process I was really taking a chance with a company I was unfamiliar with.  They did an amazing job explaining the process, outlining the costs and overall providing a very competitive rate.  Throughout the shipping  they were available to answer questions, maintained great communication and kept me at ease.  I highly recommend their services.  I will continue to use Schumacher in the future for all of my shipping needs.< /Review>

<Text>I am going through hell with these clowns. They have my car somewhere in Germany. Worse, the title was supposed to be sent to me while car was in transit but idiots don't read the file and shipped the title to somewhere in Germany too. As of now my car and its title are unaccounted for. They only answer the phone if it is a new sales call so I have to use burner numbers to get them to answer.

Wow these guys breath fresh air by far the cheapest for there quick and not a scratch on it and it 29ft so that would of been tough. Christian Mager was the best bullet like communication answer any questions immediately. I had a problem with documents and Christian sorted all for me. I bet alot companies wouldn't do that.Will be using Schumacher and Christian again next year the only people I would ever use. Thanks very much guys.</Review>

<text>Our UK moving company were daft enough to subcontract the US side of our UK to US move to these shambolic operators. Our possessions cleared customs January 2nd, and they still haven’t confirmed a delivery date. Abundantly clear that they don’t give a damn about customer service and prompt delivery - we are being treated like an inconvenience and told “we don’t have delivery dates for your area yet”. Good customer service would dictate that when you are holding the contents of a household, you MAKE a delivery date happen, and as soon as possible! Terrible and inconsistent communication throughout the process - still no-one has taken the initiative to contact us about anything without us first having to call and chase.

Take your business elsewhere to people who care about their (albeit subcontracted) customers!<//text>< Gmap_id>

{'time': 1520364124359, 'text': 'Hello Ben and Sarah,\n\nYou are correct that you possessions cleared customs on January 2nd, but the container still needed to be unpacked into our depot which can take a 3-5 business days. At that point, we estimated that we would have the deconsolidation done by January 8th, and that it would be ready to go. As soon as your goods were unpacked and ready to deliver we contacted you and let you know that we were in the process to dispatch and confirmed all delivery details.\n\nI hope you understand that it would be extremely difficult to create an accurate delivery date until we finished unloading all of your goods in our depot. It can take about a week from customs clearance to having the goods unpacked, and we needed to complete that before confirming the delivery.\n\nThank you for working with us, and your review has helped us find components of our communication process that still needs improvement.'}</Resp>

<Review>i recommend Schumacher cargo to ship vehicles oversea
i use them for 10 years and everything was smooth and easy thanks to a perfect organisation and communication
they are in the market price for ocean shipping all the time
Jenny from LA is great ...
they also arrange ground shipping from all over the USA and thanks to their locations east and west coast it makes everything possible
regular start from LA, Houston  and NY
again, thanks to Schumacher cargo (Jenny, Hugo all team...) and will definitely use them in the future</Review></record></dataset><record>

Was very happy with the team at Schumacher. We used them on the US side for our move from Sydney to Los Angeles. From the very beginning our sales rep Mark was always responsive and just made the entire experience much less of a pain. Also, their movers were great on the delivery day. Right on time, friendly and extremely patient with us. Would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a good international mover!</Text>

It is very simple advice. Try your best to avoid shipping your stuff with this company. My story was that I shipped my car from USA to Saudi Arabia with them and I paid the full amount for shipping. However, once the car reached the port in Saudi, their agency in Saudi charged me extra money. Their agency said this charge ($440) nominated by the shipper Schumacher. When I talked with the Schumacher, they said that this charge for Taxes, Duties, Custom Inspections, Destination Customs Clearance, port charges, storage, unloading or delivery services. However, I paid for all for these for another $600. Hence the $400 was simply the money goes for Schumacher and his agony overseas.  I sent cars with different shippers from different states to Saudi Arabia. However, this is the first time I face such as an issue. So my advice to you stay away from them.</Text>

To our great relief, household goods that were carefully packed and shipped from Los Angeles to Beirut arrived intact, including the specially crated chandelier.  It was good to learn that Schumacher worked with a reliable local partner (GIFCO in this case), whose personnel were impeccably qualified to process endless bureaucratic hurdles and deliver the goods in a timely fashion.  Schumacher is good and, even better, seems to know that an equally solid organization must be ready to pick up the burden at any destination.</text>

Update to Schumacher response:

Please send a genuine response to all items in the report.

To illustrate how this is done I will address your email point by below:

1. To date, we have not had assistance regarding our claim from your office, despite having paid for an insurance coordinator. Evelyn the claims coordinator has missing in action for over 2 months. Our claim has been ongoing for over 11 weeks and still nothing has been repaired, replaced or compensated for.

2. Your CEO attempted to compensate us $5000 for over $10000 in damage to our house, nothing for services not provided (which equates to approximately $10,000 in missing services) and then tried to roll in the $52,000 damage to our goods as part of his $5,000 compensation offer. When I refused this he removed the $52,000 of goods damage and upped the offer to $7,000. So in effect he offered us $7,000 for $20,000 in damages. Who on earth would accept this offer.  I am insulted that $7,000 for $20,000 is good will!

We have also stated clearly to your CEO that we did not want compensation for the house damage, but wanted it fixed. Your CEO refuses to give us his insurance details so our house can get fixed. He has told us to use our home owners policy or sue him. Again not feeling the good will or the willingness to work toward a resolution.

3. The marine insurance you arranged is also a bit laughable. I assume this is the policy Jawon Corona in your office could not get correct after three rounds of corrections with an itemized excel sheet I provided each time.

Original review text:
If there were negative reviews available, Schumacher would have them all. I have done many moves in my life, both national and international but have never come across such an incompetent and unethical group. I like many of you reading reviews, saw a good overall rating for the company and thought they could be trusted. Dig deeper and check out yelp, BBB and mover websites and you will see the horror stories.

Below is a summary of our grievances.

We hired Schumacher Cargo to do a full pack up, move, deliver and unpack from Seattle, Washington to Dublin, Ireland. What we received was very different from what we paid for. Our dispute centres around four major issues:

1. Services we paid for not provided/not provided in a professional manner
My wife had to ring Schumacher multiple times the first and last day of the packing because the movers did not show up and did not have enough resources to get the job done.

Fast forward to the move. The move was delayed two weeks because the paperwork was not filed correctly by Schumacher. This caused the financial costs listed above plus destroyed our Christmas holiday.

2. Damages for items delivered
As we have unpacked boxes ourselves we are finding many missing parts and pieces (as well as numerous damaged items.

Again because of the poor packing job, in total about 25 percent or $52,000 of items insured are damaged, missing parts or just plain missing.

3. House Damage
In Seattle, the timber floor was gouged as the movers dragged things across the foyer floor. In the Dublin house there were dings in walls and moulding, a cracked tile in the kitchen and marks all over the walls in the corridors and stairwells.

4. Additional Fees Because Schumacher Did not Provide the Proper Documentation to the Dublin Movers
Our goods were delayed over two weeks because Schumacher did not provide the local mover in Dublin with the proper import paperwork. This delayed the delivery and cost us an additional 165.00 EUR fee and 1,062 EUR in port charges.

In summary, for the $23,446.78 we paid Schumacher we did not get the service we paid for, over 2x this amount in damaged goods, damaged houses and additional import fees.</review>

<Review>Initially the process of shipping a 1957 MGA car to England was a coordination disaster! We went through one dispatch coordinator who was useless. After requesting a new coordinator we were assigned Dicarlo Bennett who was a breath of fresh air!

Dicarlo was professional, organized, responsive to questions and more. Had we not been assigned Dicarlo, we considered legal action.

If ever you decide to use Schumacher Cargo Logistics to ship a car…request Dicarlo!

I’ve given the company 2 stars but Dicarlo Bennett deserves 5 stars!!!!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2ca6c29ff06c9:0x1f0f2b8571378b1f</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
I started planning my auto import a year in advance.  Filip and the schumacher team were great at answering the barage of questions despite it being a year early.

As the time came near, they were great on handling the paperwork with the US Custom and agr departments and British export requirements.

I was concerned when i dropped the car off with their unit in Southampton as the normal vehicle inspection was repalced by a few photos.  Mario was great on listening to my concerns and wrote me out a hand receipt amd provided me vital evergreen shipping info for the car.

Evergreens shipment tracking system was fantastic and i was able to follow the container from beginning to the end (and clearing of us customs).

Schumacher had their freight forward customs broker handle all the work at the port.  It went flawlessly and the car was ready for pick up within a few days of arriving in port.  I was expecting months!

I picked Schumacher as a one stop shop for my import needs and they didnt dissapoint.  The car arrived in perfect condition.

Many thanks to the Schumacher team for making this process enjoyeable and hassle free.<//Review>

I had the most awesome experience. I worked with OSS Worldwide Australia and Schumacher Cargo Logistics to get my furniture delivered from Australia to LA. They kept me up to date the whole time, but the best thing was...

They emailed to tell me the final delivery would take 3-5 days. I'd been living from a suitcase for over a year, so I emailed to ask a crazy question - If my stuff could in fact be delivered the next day (it also was my birthday, so it was a deadline I'd had in mind for finally being settled). I got a call from Luis at Schumacher at 7.20am on my birthday and he said "Good morning Jodie, Happy Birthday!! We're delivering your furniture TODAY". It honestly was the nicest thing I could have asked for.

10 out of 10, I will use them again for sure.

Ps - It was really affordable.</Text>

<text>Schumacher made a terrible job.
We asked the team as soon as they arrived to protect the house as its a brand new house and we don t want any damages.
The team was a team of 3 guys.
As soon as they arrived they started complaining about doing the job, they were taking it easy and didn’t protect anything.
The container in Switzerland has been very well handled and loaded by rooms, very organized to make the job easy for the move in team.
One guy was the team manager and spent the morning over the phone.
The two other guys started unloading for the container to leave as soon as possible, not taking in consideration the good work that was done loading it in.
They didn’t t pay attention placing the boxes upside down... my husband has to stop them before they put the mattress on the street ground. Then seeing that they kept on complaining he decided to help them out as it was already a while they were here and nothing was in the house.
The two guys were complaining about how it wasn’t mentioned to them to bring the boxes in and to unpack and rebuild furniture ( as we opted for a full service removal). Even if we showed them our contract mentioning all prestations included they kept on denied. They explained they were not part of Schumacher company, just 2 random guys hired to do the job, that they have been told just to unload and that’s all.
Seeing how everything was going in I started to unpack all fragile items and then all the rest.
My husband had to rebuild the furniture as the guys didn’t t want to do it.
In the middle of this the team manager left his phone and decided, as we pushed for it, to go to the Recology point to remove some debris.
Before leaving us in this mess he handed my husband 500$ to pay the two guys.
That felt unreal. How come would us have to pay the two guys??
As he left, the two guys came to us saying the manager will not come back and they decided to leave with our house full of unpacked boxes, I assembled furnitures and full of debris. My husband gave them the money and they still asked for a tip!! Unbelievable. Of course as they didn’t protect the house as we required many times we have stain on the carpet, scratches and holes on the wall and near the entrance door.
Feeling bad as he said, the manager came back when he found out the guys were gone. We contacted Relocately immediately to let them know what was going on.
The guys was no use unless the bring the debris out which he did and then left.
My husband before the manager left wrote everything down to email Relocately but also in the Schumacher contract.
Now 2 months after we are still waiting for Schumacher insurance to refund the money for the diamanté’s made in the brand new house and still awaiting for a compensation from Relocately.
The big joke is we have been offered 150$ compensation for a full day of work for 2 people ( m’y husband and I) where we were not supposed to do anything, and the 2 guys left with 500$ damaging our house and the job not completed !!!!!
Relocately defending they are doing us a favor when Schumacher do not accept our version of the facts.
So how can I recommend both of them??
When you move abroad, and we are use to it, we never had any issues, we don t have to do anything and it takes a 6h job. Of course there is some organization to be made when the team leave but we never were in this nightmare situation with 2 young kids in the middle.
As I said, it is 2 months and neither the compensation neither the insurance payment have been done yet.</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

These guys were incredibly professional and efficient. Moving is always a stressful endeavor, but it helped that these guys handled everything so smoothly. They are moving us from NYC to Frankfurt, Germany, and it's still in transit at this moment, but the pickup from NYC was quick and easy. I'd highly recommend them to anyone looking to move internationally.< /review>

<text>From start to finish my move from California to the Netherlands with Schumacher Cargo Logistics has been an excellent experience. I had requested quotes from many companies and their fee came out as competitve especially given the high quality of personal service. When i had questions someone always emailed me back quickly and efficiently. Instructions for preparing my move were clear and detailed. When the crew came in exactly the date I requested they were very careful friendly and efficient in getting my goods ready forthe journey. Having arrived in the netherlands i was contacted by a very pleasant to work with company. They kept me posted on the customs process and when it came to delivering the goods again they were very careful and personable taking my especially sensitive new housing circumstance fully into account. Overall its been an excellent experience that exceeded my expectations.

<review>All but three things  (a glass, a plate, and a lampshade) in a 20 foot shipping container that went from Ilympia, Washington to Trondheim, Norway made it here in one piece and all items are accounted for. AMAZING!

In this day and age where consumers are no longer loyal customers; and with companies, it seems like it’s a race to the bottom when it comes to providing excellent customer service; I feel like I totally lucked out in selecting Schumacher Cargo Logistics.  But luck had nothing to do with it. Rather, it came down to a company (Schumacher Cargo Logistics) that quite simply excel at what they do best: Shipping and relocation, and it is my absolute honor to post this glowing review of my experience with Schumacher Cargo Logistics.  I will definitely use Schumacher again when returning to live in the States.

Needless to say, if you are in need of logistics company to relocate your household goods CONUS or OCONUS, I highly recommend Schumacher Cargo Logistics.

<text>UNFORTUNATELY NO OPTION TO GIVE ZERO STARS

DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY! THEY WILL CONTINUE TO CHARGE AFTER ITEMS DELIVERED WITH MADE UP FEE'S

We paid to get our personal items shipped from the UK to USA with a British company Britannia Movers International who outsourced the US part to Schumacher Cargo Logistics in Los Angeles, 550 W 135th St, Gardena, CA 90248

Having already paid for the agreed service we were hit by customs charges in the US and were given an invoice to pay without the breakdown of the charges and how our portion was calculated. As they had our goods, we had to pay otherwise they would charge for daily storage.

Having settled the custom charges we were given a form to fill out for the delivery address and we stated on the form that there were between 40 -50 steps. On the day of delivery, the guys mentioned it will cost $150 for carrying the items up the steps, we told them we had declared on the form that there were steps and nothing more was said. They continued to carry our items up; we paid $40 in cash to the delivery guys for their work and they accepted this and did not mention we were short of $110. After they had left, we received an email with an invoice for $150. The delivery guys did not communicate with us as we would have told them that we will carry it up the steps ourselves.

We have tried to explain to Schumacher Cargo Logistics directly as this is an unfair charge. Their response was to refer to the form ‘if additional fees for shuttle, stair carry, elevator or any other accessorial services to incur, the balance must be paid by customer no later than 7 days of delivery date. The balance can only be paid in cash on the day of delivery.’  on the same form we declared that we had between 40 -50 steps and not once was this mentioned that the cost for extra steps would be $5.36 per step after the 8 free steps (Also not mentioned on the form).  The way the form was worded suggests that if any of our information is wrong then there may be additional charges, NOT that they might decide to charge us what they feel like after we have already accepted delivery.

They have now threatened to send our invoice to collections if we don’t pay by end of tomorrow 8th Feb '19. Surely an invoice in dispute should be put on hold until a resolution has been made.</text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

< Review>
This was our second move with Schumacher (first from Tucson to Germany, and now back to Tucson). The service and communication were very clear and fast. We were told precisely, what the customs charges might be (the quotation lists that additional customs charges will arise and after calling them to ask, they clarified that the charges will be billed after customs clearance). There were no surprises with additional charges - everything was communicated and explained before we booked the shipment. We dropped off our belongings in LA and Houston ourselves to save some money and the warehouse crews were incredibly professional and friendly. To see the warehouses and the level of organization going on there put our minds at ease because we knew that our motorcycle and household goods were in good hands.
Schumacher was not the cheapest quote that we received- but its a company where there are no surprises or additional charges or delays - it was a worry free experience for us - well - just as worry free as an international move can be :)< /Review>

It was a difficult experience working with Schumacher Logisitics We would recommend they provide further information during the sign up process, such as an estimated range for delivery time (ours took significantly longer than quoted) and customs requirements (was also not clear what Schumacher would arrange and what we would arrange). The associate working directly with me could have been more responsive, though senior management was helpful to help explore and resolve some issues.</review>

I move from Yangon, Myanmar, to a small town in far West Texas. All was good. Communication all along the way was very good. It took three months but it was a not a full carton and I was told it would take some time. All in all a good experience and I would use Schumacher again.< /review>

I highly recommend Schumacher Cargo Logistics and want to thank Yvonne Crowley and her team for timely communication, transparency and exceptional service with delivery of my consignment from Sydney to San Francisco. I was notified on a day the vessel left Sydney ETA in USA point of entry is 1 July. On 26 June I received details of  US customs process that could potentially result in delay and additional costs. On 3 July I was notified vessel arrived as planned and my consignment was cleared by US customs ( therefore no delay or additional costs), on 10 July  I was asked to confirm availability for delivery on 19 and 20 July and advised actual date & time will be confirmed on 18th July. On 18th July I was advised delivery is next day 19 July 2-4pm. Delivery truck arrived at 8min past 2pm and shortly my furniture and some 40 boxes were efficiently yet carefully brought into my apartment on the second floor without any issue. Awesome job, thank you very much !< /review>

2 x Motorcycles have scratches on the fuel tanks after shipping with Schumacher. Car had footprints on top of it and damage to the paintwork. Not all Schumacher (US&UK) admin fees were quoted resulting in surprise admin fees increasing cost by about 1/3 at destination port. Advice? Read small print, ask for destination fees quote, and more importantly, use someone else.</text>

. I wanted to ship my car from USA to Saudi Arabia, and I only choose them because of their high reviews, and certainly they were not the cheapes, but I wanted my car to arrive safely so I paid the extra money. However when I received my car the roof had lots of big dents ( around 6 )
The dents were not all over the roof, just the front side of it so that is why you get two stars instead of one.
When I ship my next car, there is no way I'm going to use these guys again.
currently I'm contacting them and will let you guys know whats happens.<//review>

Rachel Ulale was our representative and I can't say enough nice things about our shipping experience with her. We were first time shippers and Rachel was knowledgeable and nice and took the time to walk us through the process. She even took us on a tour of the facility when we dropped our motorcycles off which went a long way towards reducing our nervousness and gave us a great view into their process. Thanks!</Review>

I have tried many different shipping companies over the years but my experience with Schumacher Cargo Shipping with the assistance from Mr. Joey Smit is extremely indescribable. However, he helped me to arrange for my shipment in a very difficult conditions, regardless the challenges he was ready to find out a solution even when the problem was not a part of his task. Mr. Joey is a very professional person who is very understanding and understandable. Last but not the least, Schumacher Cargo is an excellent shipping company that you should be on the to top of your choices.<//Text>

Kevin Luccarrelli is a horrible contact! I advise going with anyone else for your shipping. Because I'm sure it is a reflection of the entire company, because I tried to contact others, weeks ago upon seeing his failures, and again, had zero replies to emails and a phone call.

Kevin was never was in the office, and only sent one auto reply at the beginning. When asked questions, I was ignored.
Today, days before my deadline, I finally got a follow up email.
I said I was disappointed, and when I sent it, I got another automatic reply, saying he was out of the office on vacation until the day before my shipping date.
Horrible!

Get out of customer service jobs, if you have no intentions of helping anyone, Kevin.

Do not go with this shipper!
And don't say you were not warned!

Goodbye!</Review>

I would like to say thank you very much to the Schumacher Cargo Logistics  Team and the very professional sales executive I had the pleasure of dealing with
Ariel Martinez  on the consignment of a Modern Classic -  American Muscle Car from Seattle Washington  USA to New Zealand - Aotearoa.  Ariel worked extremely hard and was instrumental in getting this car processed from pick up to delivery to there yard .  All e/mails were replied to in a good timely fashion , he has a great phone manner , polite and respectful and understands what customer service is all about. There were excellent photos sent of the Dodge Challenger on entry to there facility with information after transportation. If you are thinking of purchasing a car from the USA to New Zealand or any other part of the world then Schumacher Logistic's is the Team to go with. I would use this company again and  would definitely recommend using this company to any body interested in Classic cars - bikes etc, for importing or exporting.   I'am very grateful to Ariel for his commitment and dedication on seeing this consignment through.  He is a real asset to this company.  Kia ora  thanks . Regards Marc.<//text>

I recently shipped household items.  I was promised the shipment would be delivered in 6 to 8 weeks.  Once Schumacher had my shipment then the delivery estimate became 8 to 10 weeks.   My shipment sat in their warehouse for four weeks before it was sent to the ship.  It was delayed one week due to customs inspection.  Once it arrived at the destination, they would not set it up for delivery.  It sat in there warehouse for another three weeks until we drove to pick it up after 16 weeks from the time the shipment was dropped off.  Their communication was unfriendly and unhelpful.  I would find another company for shipping your items.<//Review>

<resp>{'time': 1533229936223, 'text': 'Hello David,\n\nWe sincerely apologize for not meeting your time expectations for this shipment. However, our international relocation representatives would not promise you a date if you choose to ship through a shared container. On average, moves to Germany can take an estimate of 6 to 8 weeks, but the consolidation process means that container needs to be full before we can ship it. This time varies vastly and is affected by every client in the consolidation, which makes it difficult to ever have a concrete date of arrival. You always have the option to ship an exclusive container if you need to control time more specifically, though it would have been over ten times the price for your amount of goods. In regards to unfriendly and unhelpful communications, we would appreciate if you could forward any issues you had to emarketing@sclusa.com so that we can address ways to improve in that aspect. Thank you for choosing Schumacher Cargo Logistics for your international relocation and we hope to improve and work with you again in the future.\n\nSCL - Management'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ca6c29ff06c9:0x1f0f2b8571378b1f<//gmap_id></record>

<Text>I have shipped two bikes with Schumacher Cargo Logistics.  They were picked up from Crystal Beach Florida and transported to Long Beach California where they were then shipped accross the Atlantic to Sydney Australia.  It is here that I must say that I remained extremely satisfied with the condition and speed of their arrival.  On contact the staff were very helpful and eager to assist.  All my inquiries were treated politely with patience and understanding.  Their online tracking system provided me with peace of mind through varying stages of shipment.  I am now engaging Schumacher Cargo Logistics to ship another motorcycle from the United States to Australia.

Very pleased

Schumacher was on top of every detail from beginning to end.  No detail was too small.  From origin thru transport when we asked questions / had comments there was an immediate response.
Professionalism was 2nd to none.

I never had a problem with a car. Our cars have never been damaged during that time. As a classic car pro it's always our fear, specially when you have to release very rare cars worth up to few hundred thousand to $ millions. We are talking about thousands of cars exported worlwide thru their services.
Personally, I don't have time for mediocrity, incompetence nor amateurism.
If pros work with Schumacher it's because they are pros at what they do. Simple.

I am an American that decided to move from Southern California to Romania. I moved sixty years of memories, belongings and my Harley Davidson to be with my extended family here.  The Move started in November of 2017,from two different locations there. The first to be loaded up was the house. Second was my storage unit which was fifteen miles from the house. Ergo, I was on the telephone and the Internet for what seemed like hours. Be prepared ! Seriously, this the one time that you must read the "small print ." I must say that I didn't at first. The prices will vary imensele. IE I found a company that half the costs of Schumacher ! However, the old saying that "you get what you pay for?" I found this to be absolutely true. My sales representative, Nathan Stowell certainly was upfront and honest through the entire process. His professionalism and experience definitely not go unmentioned. Nathan walked me through all of this small print mentioned. I will not go into why payment was very late, everyone has issues and/or problems with their financial institutions. Which brings me to the Accounts Receivable department there at Schumachers Gardena office. It's now April 2018 and payment has not arrived! Another true professional informed me substantial late and storage fees. Pamela Elliott even though I could not provide her with appropriate documentation as to why the payment was late , Pamela Elliott took me at my word and waived said fees!?! Honestly, my bank was guilty not Schumacher!  Folks we live in the greatest country on the planet the USA!  Most companies would have been sitting on all my belongings until Paid In Full and rightfully so! Not Schumacher!!! Quite frankly, I was and currently am still in awe. As the company had already shipped all of my memories and before receiving payment in full first? ! Remarkable!  As most know this just doesn't happen in America, period! I paid them immediately ! To trust in me? A person that they had never met face to face ? Yes I'm sure that they had recourse, if payment was not made. My point is that these professional people are in good, if not great people and they treated me as a person. In closing, if you want professional people like taking care of your items that are important to you and care about you ? Schumacher is the answer to your moving needs. What else can I say?  TRY THEM YOU'LL LIKE THEM!
Once again, I have NEVER given 5 Stars to any service or product before. Also I have never written such a long review! They merit both!
Personal thanks to Nathan and Pamela.< /review>< name>

Fantastic.  After a divorce and a nervous breakdown, I've decided to live back in France.  I have 2 LINCON (70s) and 2 big crates I builted myself. Well, shipping myself the 2 crates disassembled  and all the stuff I had from Oklahoma to Houston, I was able to re-assemble my 2 crates and fill them with with 1000s of parts-goods at  the Schumacher facility, 2 days labor. The price was really good. They don't charged me for all my work I done at Schumacher. Thank's Ron T at Schumacher Houston.</review>

This is one of the worst company that I have ever to deal with.
The arte cheater and they are there to rip off customer for no reason. Employee lie to you and their forms that has "Terms and conditions" are hidden and when you click on it does not open and when you call them they simply says that this is for us to handle your goods etc,....
there are by far better companies out there. Do you r homework and do not, I say DO NOT TRUST them.<//Text>

Please avoid this company. Very poor communication and poor customer service. They never contacted me with any information about my shipment, I always had to initiate contact for updates. My shipment of household goods from Baltimore to Barcelona took 5 Months door to door. Schumacher said it would take 5 to 8 weeks. I measured the volume of all of my boxes and the total was 137 CF, after they picked up the shipment and took it to their warehouse, they measured the volume as 30 CF larger. There was no way for me to verify or dispute this revised volume measurement. Save yourself the stress and money and find another shipper.</text>

Company was very helpful and communicative until I payed for my shipping services. Then my shipment got picked for a random custom inspection and I was told I would be receiving an invoice for additional charges. The additional charges turned out to be more than half of what the original cost of shipping was. I sent emails asking various questions and they would pick and choose what questions they felt like answering and would take their time when getting back to me. All of this was not how they were operating before when dealing with them for my quote and dropping off of my shipment. I requested to see a breakdown of these charges and they outright refused to give me a breakdown and said I needed to talk to US Customs or Price Transfer, which I did and they told me I needed to talk to Schumacher for something like that. It was a great experience up until the charges for the random Customs inspection and unfortunately in my opinion you need to be great from start to finish or you are not great at all. I would never recommend them to anyone and I will never use them again for any shipment of mine.<//review>

<resp>{'time': 1459871214410, 'text': 'Hi Jeff,\n\nThe issue here is US customs charges, they are not Schumacher Cargo charges. Every container within the US has the opportunity to be randomly selected for inspection. This is border control and unfortunately, the charges always fall back on the shipper’s account.\n\nIt is just the nature of the industry and is frustrating for our company as well because of that added stress it causes for our clients. I am sorry that your container was selected, but it happens from time to time and we have no influence nor power to prevent it.\n\nAs for transparency on the fees, we show all clients the bill we receive and pay to the exam site and if need be, the shipping line etc. So I don’t understand why you were not given them as its part of our process.\n\nPlease feel free to contact me to review this if you need anything.'}</resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ca6c29ff06c9:0x1f0f2b8571378b1f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>I have nothing but praise for Schumacher and its employees, with a special mention to Filip Michelet. Very friendly, extremely approachable, nothing seems to be too much trouble for them. Even when dealing with a troublesome situation entirely out of their control, Schumacher's were extremely patient and helpful, always keeping the lines of communication open. They are highly professional and really tick the boxes: even for a client on the other side of the world!
I would not hesitate to recommend Schumachers for cargo services, and I would be delighted to do business with them again.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

A disaster from start to finish.

We shipped our 1965 Ford Mustang from New Jersey to Rotterdam.  We were told it would take 3 to 4 weeks.  Instead it took over 3 months!!  The service we received was incompetent, inattentive and sloppy.  It also arrived with large scratches and parts broken off.

We would never use this company again.< /review>

{'time': 1366840403847, 'text': 'Per Damien, the Sales Manager of Schumacher Cargo\n\nThis shipment did have an unnecessary delay that was related to two things.\n\n1.\tInitially there were 2 cars to be shipped and the client made us aware that it was then only one vehicle, shortly after dropping off his first vehicle.\n\n2.\tThis was logged in the system, but operations did not know that the second car was not shipping until sometime later. They assumed that we were holding off processing the first car until the second arrived.\n\n3.\tOnce we rectified this within our procedure, we loaded in the next container leaving for Holland.\n\n4.\tWe apologized to the client and offered discount on any future shipment he may have.\n\nSome of the time that is accounted for within the 77 days from booking to hand over at final destination is a normal part of consolidation.\n\nThe process once a booking is made and we are ready to load, can take up to 10 days of the process. Then sail time on the ocean was 17 days/ usual lead in time for a consolidation from the US to Holland, which means we load multiple cars into one 40’ container can be anywhere from 2-4 weeks from drop off before it hits the ocean. Therefore, we did lose about 3 weeks on this.\n\nWe ship from 5 ports in the US to over 80 destinations around the world. Most clients want the most competitive rate we can offer, which is in a shared container. This means we cannot guarantee the sail date until we have a full container to load.\n90% of our shipments leave with 2-4 weeks of drop off and then the sail time is variant, depending on the destination.\nWe ship 18,000 vehicles a year and sometimes, certain files are delayed for very specific reasons. We do strive to deliver our promise to each client.\n\nFor more information on what the process involves for your shipment, please call us on 800 599 0190 and ask for our Export Department.'}<//resp>

< Review>
THis was a totally flawless and beautifully executed experience. I have have had previous horror stories and moving can be the most unpleasant  story. My time with Schumacher was a second one- they brought me from New Zealand to Los Angeles three years ago, also perfectly organized and amazing service.
THis time I needed moving from Los Angeles to Washington DC. Luis bent over backwards to accomodate the complications which I presented him with, and made the entire experience one that I am ready to repeat tomorrow. I have never imagined how easy a move can be. The price was excellent, the goods arrived on time (the driver checked with me regularly on the way to update me on traffic and ETA) and when they arrived they carried all the goods in perfectly.
Especially working with Luis was an absolute pleasure from beginning to end. I cannot recommend this company highly enough, and I have had many experiences with movers- this was by far the best.
Thank you to Luis and crew for a wonderful job!

Summary: Great shippers. 8-10 weeks from LA to Sydney, very responsive and timely communication. Always willing to keep customer happy.

We recently immigrated from LA (USA) to Sydney (Australia). Had many options for shipping, I was about to go with XYZ shipper, when I found Schumacher Cargo online and spoke to with Mark. Being Aussie himself he was knowledgeable with the customs and Quarantine process. That 1 phone call made me change my mind. I confirmed with SCL. They were not the least expensive, but were very competitive and provided door-to-door. Most of all, I felt like I was in good hands. Over time their assistance and responsiveness to my queries and requests confirmed that I was. The pick-up, packaging at my house was quick, professional.

Edwin next took up my case and followed up with updates on warehouse receipt, updated quote (which was close to my initial estimate). bill of lading, destination delivery company, ship details and when it docked in Sydney.

Pamela from the A/c Receivable was great to work with as well. There was a minor change I wanted made in my account summary. She helped me out pretty quick. Easy breezy!

From then on the local shipper has been in touch with me and I'm waiting for my goods now. I know it's been through quarantine (AQIS). It's probably finishing Customs now.<//review>

<review>Used SCL to ship my car from Los Angeles to Netherlands. Webpage is convenient and easy to book and check prices beforehand. I shipped my car filled with personal items ($150 flat fee for filling trunk and back seat with items).
They told me the car would arrive in maximum 8 weeks, and it took around 7.5 weeks to arrive.
I decided against insuring the shipment, and everything arrived in perfect condition.

Be aware that besides the cost of shipping by SCL, there's another payment to be made to the receiving company. In my case I was told by SCL it would be around 500 euro, and it ended up being 750 euro.

Overall I had a great experience.</review>< Pics>

Schumacher had shipped our Lexus car from USA to Belgium over  3years ago. And when  it came to our relocation back to the US, we again selected Schumacher to ship back our car. It was one of the best choices we made! The price was not only affordable but most of all the SCL team made of Filip Michelet, Dac Chan and Bart Brauwere provided excellent service and support throughout and went beyond our expectations. They provided answers to all our questions, guidance and advice that is unparalleled. We count ourselves lucky to have worked with a team dedicated to serving customers no matter what! Thanks a million team! Ready to engage SCL again in future and recommend to my family and friends!</review>

Used them in 2015. Everything went fine in the beginning.
Good customer service, advisible agent and everything was smoothly prepared.

The chaos began when the car was shipped. They totaly lost control of the shipment.
Car was shipped to different port then agreed with a big delay and all additional costs were passed to me.

Changing port destination resulted in
- higher port costs
- additional documentation cost (T1 documents)
- additional transportation fees by land to another country
- delay in time
- documents lost for a couple of days
- lots of stress

After changing the port destination they did not even have a reliable company to take care of the transport.
They changed it after realizing it will cost them a little bit more money. This resulted in documents being stucked.

The documents deliver was delayed because of Schumacher poor and cheap handling which resulted
in again me having to cover additional costs.

I had to chase the transpor vendors by myself and track my car documents to find out that they sent it with regular cheap mail...

The car delivery to customs needed to be delayed thenas I needed to get the documents first...
Car secure parking costs for a couple of days were passed to me again.

Car delivery took them 3 months in total.

After many complains they agreed to cover some of the additional costs but NEVER DID just ignored my further complains.

Amateur handling.
After the car is shipped they do not care anymore and will only think about reducing their costs at the expense of the client.

It seems like you were happy with everything at the time. The driving factor of your complaint is that you had additional destination fees of $200, which we explained in detail at the time.\n\nAs we discussed at the time of your email, we said that we would refund the difference between the new agents fees and your quoted fees- this was approx $200 in total. For most shipments that accrue some additional charges, this figure rarely raises this type of malicious result.\n\nConsidering that we expedited the shipment via Germany to have your car delivered to you as soon as possible - we never lost control of any aspect of the shipment. This was a fast and accurate shipment, you can see the timeline below as well. What you did not understand was the customs process and organization we had to put in place to safe guard the transition of your car from German customs, through to Polish customs. Your opinion on how we handled this is perspective, and not accurate to the reality of what had to happen, all to your benefit.\n\nAnyone reading this who has shipped cars overseas will know the timeline involved.\n\nEvery destination is different. Poland is not a popular destination for shared container service, this is why we routed your car via Germany, which is a very common entry port for a lot of EU countries. We offer a shared container service to over 80 destinations worldwide, which is the service you chose due to the competitive nature of the quote. The time frame is never guaranteed and you were aware of this from the start.\n\nWe did understand your frustration due to a delay, however that is part of consolidation and international logistics. It seems like nothing we did would have appeased you and to insinuate that we purposefully rerouted your shipment (which added additional "no charge" hours of coordination with overseas agents from our operations department, not to mention documentation filing) simply to charge you a few hundred dollars extra is just false.\n\nHi Schumacher,\nREF# HOU0033227\nI got the car and personal goods on 1st June and everything looks good. Thank you!\nThe last thing is the matter of additional costs I was forced into due to the lack of proper organization.\n* There was no lack of proper organization- this was an international shipment of a vehicle from Houston to Bremerhaven port in Germany, where it had to be customs cleared and then re directed legally to Poland where it needed to be customs cleared yet again, using a T1 import document. We did all this professionally and to the letter of the law.\nThe deal was to transport the car to Gdynia (Poland) by sea.\n* The deal was to ship your car from Houston to Poland- we did that. The fact that it was routed via Germany is a standard logistical process that we as your freight forwarder chose to expedite your shipment. Shared container service is what you chose, and this is part of that process.\nI understand that you have changed plans due to lack of containers to Gdynia that\'s okey with me.\n* Here you agree with the situation\nWhat I don\'t understand is the three additional costs that occurred on my side and should be covered by Schumacher.\n* The additional charges amounted to $200 to account for the transport of your car with an agent who could service the shipment in Germany\n* Plus some additional customs documents needed to cross the border\n* These were all explained to you at the time\n\nUnfortunately the length of our response is limited to a certain length, however we will be happy to discuss in more detail whenever you like.\n\nRegards,\n\nSchumacher Cargo'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<text>Schumachers would have to be the best company in the US that I have found to move my imported products from the US to Australia. I was very lucky to have found such a great professional company like  Schumachers. Ive been dealing with Filip Michelet from day one and could not ask for better service from him. He is always on time,does what he says he is going to do,follows up on everything from trucking to shipping. My shipments always arrive from his warehouse in perfect condition everything. I can highly recommend Schumachers</text>< resp>

<Review>Schumacher Cargo Logistics were great. They informed us of our shipment as soon as it arrived from England, UK. They kept their email contact with us all along: the arrival of the shipment; the cause of delay to leave Southhampton, UK; The delay at the customs around the Holidays; they kept up their email of informaion all through until the delivery. They called to ask which was the most appropriate date of delivery, that will suit us, including the hour.
They were terrific as to their timing, delivery, unloading, unpacking, and putting  everything in place, where we asked them to place it.
They were meticulous, proper and up to their word. What else could have been better!
I reccomend SCL with a record of excellence, to all friends and relatives, plus you the reader!<//Review>< user_id>

<Review>I've never imported anything to the US much less a Bentley!  I was referred to Schumacher Cargo Logistics to get the job done, the car from Spain to Denver, CO.  Filip Michelet, Schumacher's contact person for me through the entire process, did an incredible job for me.  Even before I purchased the Bentley in Spain Filip answered all of my questions about how the import would occur, what paperwork would be needed and how to get the car registered here once in the US. I'm sure he had better things to do than answer all of the questions from somebody (me) that will probably never import another big item again.  I'm just a guy in Colorado holding my breath that I can buy an expensive car in Spain and feel comfortable during the process that the car will get to me without any problems or issues! Filip couldn't have done a better job keeping me up to date at each step in the import process.  He held my hand as I held my breath, paid for the Bentley and hoped I would be well represented in getting the car home!  Schumacher got the car through US customs without issue this week and my thanks go out to all Schumacher people that helped me, but especially Filip Michelet, the personal face of Schumacher for my job.  Many thanks, Filip!!      Don Larrick< /Review>< Pics>

This was my first experience in shipping a car from the USA to the UK and Schumacher helped me evey step of the way from collecting from the sellers house in CA to delivering it to the wharehouse in the UK, the car arrived within the timescale and price quoted and myself and car where carefully looked after throughout the process, special thanks to Kevin Luccarelli (sales) who answered every email and answered all my questions (there were plenty) the man is a credit to schumacher and if i intend to ship anything again he will be the first man i will call, you should do the same, thanks again.<//Review>

<review>I recently asked Schumacher Cargo Logistics to assist me with shipping three cars (2 from Ohio,1 from Connecticut) to the UK. At all times they were most helpful and communicative, assisting me with the safe transport, export and arrival in the UK. They were more than happy to go the extra mile with anything I needed, sent photos of the cars on arrival at their facilities and kept me constantly informed of their location. The whole operation went very smoothly indeed.

Tevel packed up & sent my shipment, & contracted Schumacher to deal with customs on the U.S. end & do final delivery.

When my shipment arrived in the U.S., I was told that customs had required additional inspections, which would cause a delay and additional costs. I understand this happens, it is (probably) not Schumacher's fault. I was told by my shipping coordinator Tim Gallardo that it would be $285 in customs fees & other related "small additional fees." Schumacher billed me for $976. When I tried to speak with both Tim Gallardo & his manager Nik Nikoukar about this unfair charge I was held hostage & told that "either [I] pay the $976 or [they'll] hold my shipment & start charging [me] storage."

So I paid it, what choice did I have? ...but did they deliver my shipment as promised? No.

At first they didn't tell me there was a problem, they just said they'd call me with a delivery date. When that didn't happen. I called over & over again, trying to get the date in question to no avail. When I finally demanded they deliver it, I found out that my shipment was being held hostage for the second time, they told me there was an "accounting hold," (with no further explenation available) & to call Tevel Logistics to work it out.

So I did, I called Tevel multiple times. Every time they said everything was fine, that Schumacher must have a mistake in their paperwork, & that they would contact them to work it out.

Schumacher refused to tell me anything other than "accounting hold," when I demanded answers I was told by Nik Nikoukar that "[they] don't work for me," (since they were subcontracted by Tevel) despite the fact that I'd already paid them almost $1000. For 2 months I spent hours trying to get an honest answer from them on the phone, & emailing back & forth with them.

In the end I had to go to the BBB & threaten legal action, then I got the answer that Schumacher claims that Tevel never paid them (I don't know whether this is true or not, & given that every other thing they've told me has been a lie, I have my doubts), & only when I demanded they let me know how much Tevel owed them so I could contest the original credit card charge to Tevel & use that money to pay them (which I didn't have to do in the end), did they finally deliver my shipment, months late, & after tons of stress & hours if not days of my time wasted.

If they weren't paid by Tevel, that's bad business on Tevel's end. It still doesn't justify the other ripoffs or me being held hostage twice. Or how rude they were to me. Or my time that they wasted by refusing to give me a strait answer. Or the amount of stress they caused me. Or the fact that my shipment was 2 months late (when I did everything right). Or the fact that I was forced into the middle of their inter-company dispute. Or why "small fees," is >$600...</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I bought a 1970 Chevelle in Richmond, Indiana, and wanted to take it over to Germany. As this car means a lot to me, I needed a shipping partner that gets things done right. I have never done business with SCL before but had an other company take care of this job in the past. I was very pleased with the job SCL did and my experiences in the past encouraged this impression.
Personnally, I dealt with Mr. Mager who has never been bugged by my countless inquiries and E-mails. He offered reasoned advice when needed, and he is a very professional and friendly sales manager. Whenever I decide to get a car from the U.S. again, he will be the person I contact for the shipping part.
I could not make it to take the car to the SCL-drop off myself but had SCL get it from the seller (Richmond - NYC). As soon as they got hold of the car, they sent me a note and, not long after, a protocol with numerous photographs to state the condition of the vehicle when they got it. Very good job. They used paper covers in order to keep the carpets clean, plastic seat- AND steering wheel-covers. That's what I call appreciation and accurate work. The only negative thing about the deal was that the car sat in NYC for about 2 weeks before it got on the ship. I think, this may be done a little faster. But anyway, the car sat in a warehouse and not in the rain. The actual shipping didn't take long, just as the handling and custom clearance in the Netherlands. Their partner in Rotterdam, MCH, is a good choice, too.
Every thing worked out really good. Thank you for your business. From my experience, I would recommend SCL to anyone who needs a shipping partner.< /text>

<Text>I will never go back to this place EVER AGAIN. They cut my nails crooked before they put on my acrylics and paid $50 for some ugly bulky nails. The nails look too big. She was rushing to do my nails the whole time. I got there at 2:10 and was out by 2:40pm. Worst nail salon in the community. To end it off, she left paint all over my hands.< /Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Larry and Kim are the owners of this place and they are very nice and friendly. You can either walk in or have an appt and you do not have to wait very long before it's your turn. Everyone who works here does a terrific job doing nails or pedicures. They are always joyful and they enjoy what they do.<//Review>

They didn’t soak my feet enough barely scrubbed and massaged them. They also don’t use the plastic lining inside the tub for each person which is a huge noooo for me. The gel polish was cute though.</review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

I went in asking for them to remove my acrylic nails. The lady basically charged me 15 dollars to file off the gel top coat. They were hard to take off but that's why I went to "professionals" they could have soaked my nails in acetone or file them off as much as possible without hurting my real nails. I ended up going home and removed the nails myself.< /Text>

I visited Kim's nails on 08/04/18 for a Gel Manicure and Pedicure, I waited for about  45 minutes and that was fine I learned that it's best if I make an appointment. My biggest disappointment is that on  08/08/04 just FOUR days after my visit, my gel manicure started to peel off!  4 days!! I paid $65.00 dollars for my visit I am very disappointed in the quality of work!.<//Text>

<Response>None</Response><review>This place came highly recommend (and talked about) by a family member who is a regular at this place so I gave it a shot well I only gave 3 stars because I called and asked how much for a pedi and polish she said it would be $22 so I made the appointment, after soaking my feet for a bit she pulled out the first foot to start the pedi then stopped and said "Oh for you $35" I was a little embarrassed I take care of my feet so they weren't that damn bad lol and also since it's the day before Mother's Day and they were busy I didn't want to seem unappreciative so I paid it I will say that she did do an awesome job but you gotta watch the pricing with them!! Because of the price issue I will NOT be going back!!<//review><GmapID>0x80952b8a41fe28e3:0xe8cc8b41dde1443b<//GmapID><rating>3<//rating>< userid>

<Text>I usually go for a pedi and they always came out great.  But this time I Went in for a full set with chrome gel polish, for my graduation. Sad to say this was not worth any of my $$. There was a brown hair from the brush in one of the nails, and she blamed it on the grey jacket i wore.....The nails were not smooth and the chrome shine really showed off all of the uneven dents in the nails. The chrome was patchy on some parts of the nails. The shapes r all different too I was not happy. I walked back in to have them fix it or take off the chrome but they just added more chrome and kept saying that’d just how the chrome is u don’t kno because you’ve never had it. I said yes I have it on my toes right now, and some of the other finger nails don’t look dented or patchy ? So I didn’t get it and ended up leaving still shaking my head unhappy with the $50 I spend :/ sad to say I won’t be going back.<//Text><Gmap_id>0x80952b8a41fe28e3:0xe8cc8b41dde1443b<//Gmap_id><response>None< /response></record>

Walked in to get my nails done but i walked out feeling ashamed of the people working in that place. They were over charging me for a very simple nail style. When i said i didn’t want them after all due to over price, ALL the employees started looking at me while laughing. They assumed i didnt understand their language. Shame on them for being so  obnoxious and unprofessional..👎🏻<//Review>

<Text>Horrible. The people are friendly but the wait is very long. I asked for medium length coffin nails and got very short uneven nails. The polish was very thick and lumpy. My nails aren't smooth they look dented amd uneven. I cannot emphasize how uneven they are. I am not a picky peraon at all they are very bad. Don't waste your time and money here. I'd rather go to Happiness nails they may not be the best in customer service but thet are quick and my nails looked 100 times better<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>I would give zero if I could. Rude disrespectful and just money hungry! I asked Kim her self, the owner, to have them fixed and was told I would have to pay the price of a fill $35 just have all the gel taken off I was told it was my fault they look how they do because the man that did them was distracted af!. Keep in mind I even asked her just to take the gel off not put anything back on them I was told i would still have to pay.</Review>< Time>

<Review>Chicken was cooked properly so it tasted really fresh. There was some wait as expected..I pretty much enjoyed their Gochujang sauce (Korean style hot sauce for chicken) and I can tell the sauce has enhanced taste of Gochujang (thick soypaste mixed with red peppers). Generally, I think there are four kinds of Korean style sauces for chicken. 1. Soy sauce (relatively new). 2. Hot sauce (hot & sweet; sometimes, very mildly hot but extremely sweet). 3. Hot sauce (more with 'deep' Gochujang flavour). 4. Nothing (perhaps only with powdered salt as a side). Recently, I've been into the third version. So, it was really great here. However, the fried chicken itself was not like something that I can eat only in Korea.< /Review>< Pictures>

their chicken is really good but this review is just for their fries. i got some chicken and fries today. and as you can see in the photo, that’s all i got. seriously? that’s your regular portion? or am i just special? lol

they literally put 6 sauce packets on top of fries to make it look full or cover them up idk. i counted them and there’s about 30 or less fries. so freaking disappointed!

it’s sunday and may be y’all are busy but this is not okay. i didn’t want to say anything and make a deal about it but then i realized that if i don’t let y’all know, y’all won’t have chance to improve it and do better. so please do better than this.<//Text>

I would give them zero star If I could. The worst customer service that I have ever received from a restaurant.
I have been ordering at bbq chicken in Los Angeles location for a couple years. I always order either kimchi pasta or carbonara pasta with chicken. Obviously I know how their pasta taste like..
This time I ordered carbonara pasta and it taste super sweet like sweet as candy. So I called them to complain about my pasta and the female worker who picked up the phone insisted that they have never got any complaints regarding pasta and they used same receipt. First thing she should have done was apologizing. Im pretty sure they put sugar instead of salt. She was extremely rude and ignorant. Please  learn how to do customer service if you are working at that industry.< /Text>

It's in their folks - every day can be a Chicken !  We've got many choices for great Korean chicken in the area but we always come back to Chicken.

We always go for the whole, bone-in, chicken.  Our favorites are Sweet and Spicy, Garlic and Spicy and Korean Pepper Sauce (!!!).  The sauce...good."  It also comes with plenty of pickled radish and napkins, which you'll definitely need.

The service was fast , friendly and the price was right.< /Text>

This spot is the one I like best. I eat in a lot of restaurants but to this restaurant I  constantly return again and again. The team is very amicable and the food they place on your table is so fresh and tasty. I never decline to have a good meal here. Highly recommended.< /Text>

<Review>If you're a fan of their original crunchy chicken that you see in all of the K-Dramas this the actual franchise! Unfortunately they are a horrible horrible horrible! Did I mention horrible example of the company! Nasty food and terrible service. We threw the food away and was so disgusted that we waited 45 mins just to waste our money! Not to mention how sick we got. They are worse than the Pandemic!< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I've been to Nashville for the best fried chicken sandwiches. My standard might be pretty high and so I'll lower my expectations for this review. I always crave that Southern flavor and keep looking for that flavor in the bay. Chicken as Cluck does it pretty well. I match the 4/5 in my review for the reason that it's the best hot chicken sandwich I've had in the area so far.< /Text>

< Review>
If i can give 0 stars i would!! I ordered a full chicken half half via postmates. When the chicken arrived it was soooo salty that i couldnt eat more than 3 pieces. I order chicken from here pretty often, so i know how the chicken taste from here. I called saying that their chicken was reallly salty today that im unable to eat it, hoping at the least an apology. But the person on the phone so rudely tells me i should just deal with postmates. I told them im complaining about the taste, and that Postmates has nothing to do it with this since postmates is purely a delivery service. They insisted i talk to postmates. How is postmates suppose to control the salitiness of the food??? No apology, basically just hung up on me. K town has so many other great chicken options, never ordering from here again!</Review>

<Review>Chicken is fine. But Korean staffs working here are rude and inefficient. That is how I give them one star. If there were zero star, I would have rated zero. They never come to you to ask if we need anything, and gives you biotchface when you ask for something. On top of food taking forever.< /Review><user>100329418360088012097< /user><Time>1543133084030<//Time>< user_name>

<Text>If you’re a fan of BTS, all those chicken commercials BTS is doing is for this company - “BBQ Chicken” which Korean people interestingly read it as “Bee Bee Kyu Chee Keen” instead of “Barbecue Chicken”. Also there is nothing BBQ about it, as it’s deep fried in oil, not barbecued.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Okay...let me start off with their terrible service. Even when there's hardly anyone there, they still can't provide decent service. When we arrived, our party of 5 sat down at the table that seats 6 people. When a party of 6 walked in, the woman came over and wanted us to move to a table for 4...which she would add a chair at the end of the table. Keep in mind that we've been seated for a while. She eventually figured out that if she puts 2 tables together, that works to seat 6 too! Through the course of our lunch, I must have walked up to the counter 4 times for water refills. Since there's no service, there shouldn't be a tipping option in their POS system.

We ordered several dishes here. This is certainly the wrong place to come to if you're on a diet or trying to watch what you eat. Nothing skinnylicious or healthy about BBQ Chicken. We had an order of the Gangnam Wings, Grilled Sausage with Potato, and the 10 piece Original Whole Chicken. I thought everything was pretty good, but felt a little gross after eating all of the greasy food. My personal favorite was the Gangnam Wings. A ton of flavor packed into these little things.

Parking in their lot is valet and $2. I recommend that you just park in their lot instead of dealing with the meters on the street. $2 is not bad at all.< /text>< Pics>

Good service and elegant  modern interior design. However, I can only gave 4 stars for the food. The food was creative but not surprisingly good. The duck was salty and dry. The manager changed to trout after I told him. Lobster soup was too creamy. Lime Posset was special.<//review>

The chicken is just so addictive, I can never stop eating even though my mouth is burning. Whatever their spice blend is, I sure hope they've kept the recipe safe because it's literally gold.

A lot of my Korean friends recommended this place to me so I had some high expectations but I didn't really see anything special about it. Service is meh, the girl who took our order just looked like she didn't want to be there. Their menu is pretty big and they have a lot of different types of chicken wing options. Something I find interesting is that their prices are higher than most chicken wing spots in Ktown. Honey glazed and soy garlic are some of their most popular. Both were pretty delicious, honey mustard sauce is a little too sweet. What I did notice was that they also take a while to bring out the food- like 20 minutes? With other Korean fried chicken shops opening up, it looks like they have major competition in Ktown, they need to step it up!< /text>

Plus the customer service is terrible.
They will ask you to pay cash so won’t be able to get your refund, if your order will take forever!
It’s a scam. I hope the chicken is at least worth it.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7796df6ffd3:0x3d7f274cae7b69f< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

My favorite Korean fried chicken spot. Half & half original and mild spicy is good to share with some friends. Also love the Asian chicken salad with house dressing< /Text>

The chicken was good but it was a little greasy I was hoping their garlic chicken was less marinated and more of a seasoning flavor. I got the garlic combo. I really like the spicy and soy flavor but I still wished it was seasoned instead of marinated.</Review>

They offered 5% discount on cash transaction, so i paid with cash. I've ordered spicy and cheese flavored chicken. The chicken was dried and chewey and very thick breaded layer. It was not worth waiting 50 minutes. I wouldn't recommend it.<//Text>

You get your money's worth when it comes to portion size, as the chicken fillet, or rather, gargantuan hunk of chicken is huge and typically laughingly exceeds the bun or rolls capacity.< /text>

The first time I had this place I texted all my friend's with pics and RAVED about this place. It was by far the best wings I felt like I had ever had. You could smell the flavor through the bag!!! The fried wings (with 52 seasonings) were FIRE. But the soy garlic were  actually mouthwatering. I LOVE the pickled radish!!! The ranch dressing was flavorless but you truly don't need it for these wings. The next time I ordered, I was a little disappointed. I ordered the honey garlic wings and waffle fries. The wings were your typical run of the mill wings. Basic flavor, they were significantly smaller, and they had a thin skin...nothing like the soy garlic I previously had. What I loved about the first batch was the crunch! I'm down to try it again for sure, if it can get anywhere near the first time I tried it....I'm a fan for life!!!< /text>

<Text>Look, the only reason this place takes a while ( 15-25 minutes, more or less) to serve is because the food is made when you order it. Me and my family came in here to dine in because my father has been to their Westwood location. We had the Honey garlic wings, Soy Garlic drumsticks & The fried platter. Everything was so delicious that I only got to take a picture of the waffle fries I ordered because I was too excited for this chicken. It is worth the wait and very delicious. And they deliver! So I highly recommend this place! Especially the soy garlic drumsticks!!<//Text></record>

<text>BBQ Chicken is one of my all-time favorite spots to get Korean fried chicken in LA. They consistently provide quality food that makes me come running back for more.

Original Drumsticks: 5/5
This is my go-to item on the menu. I love the taste of the crispy, buttery skin with the tender, juicy meat. Their drumsticks also have a lot of meat on them, so having a few of them would probably satisfy your hunger. The original drumsticks have no flavor to them, but regardless they still taste amazing. You can purchase a sauce on the side and use it to dip the chicken, though it isn't necessary for me. I highly recommend, you can't go wrong with this choice!

BB Wings: 4/5
On their menu, they indicate the BB wings as spicy. However, I did not think they were spicy at all. The flavor was great nonetheless, but I thought they weren't worth it for its size. The wings are tiny and there isn't much meat on them. It honestly tasted like the mini version of the original drumstick, but with a bit of a kick to it.

Service: 1/5
I've never actually dined at this restaurant and I definitely would not want to, as their customer service is lacking. Every time I pick up my order, the servers are never friendly or welcoming. They also skimp out on the side dishes. For one order, they give you a free side dish of the radish. If you want an extra one, they make you pay an additional dollar. However, if I'm paying extra, I expect at least the same size of the free side dish. If you see my picture below, it's only one-third the size, which is pretty ridiculous. This is one of the few restaurants that I still go back to, despite the lack of customer service, because of the quality of their food.<//text><name>Regina Kempel<//name>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Food is okay but it's outrageous how they charge two dollars for the house cabbage salad which is supposed to be free in all BBQ chicken franchise. It is illegal for them to charge for a basic salad.They also charge 1.50 extra for the extra pickled radish to Togo customers. The salad was ordered when the chicken came out but was served 10 minutes later after we asked for it again. There are three employees but only one of them is doing all the work. The other two are busy chatting and are actually louder than the customers. This place definitely needs more structure and discipline. Poor customer service and violation of franchise policies. The one on buena park is way way better. Never going to this particular location again in my life. Also, valet is 3 dollars.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

<name>Tim Kong<//name><Time>1561451364125<//Time><Rating>4<//Rating><Review>So it's my first time coming here, going together with friends that introduced me to BBQ Chicken LA. I gotta say the chicken was fantastic. I had the half chicken order of honey garlic and a mild spicy one with a bit of a tropical taste my friend had ordered. Both were delicious and pretty filling for a group of four. The cups of ice waters was also great, it's a weird thing to add but the cup of ice water can really factor in for me when it comes to sitting down; chatting, eating, relaxing at the restaurant. I'm gonna need a lot of water, the only downside here that I noticed first glance. The service was a bit slow due to I guess not realizing we were waiting to order for around like 15 mins. Also the parking was pretty small so CARPOOL as much as possible. Other than that the food here is great and I'll definitely come back with friends.<//Review>< pictures>

BBQ Chicken is one of the best fried chicken places in Ktown. Their chicken is so crispy and tasty especially their best seller dish, the half and half, that comes with half fried and half sweet spicy korean sauce. The place is small so there's not much seating available. Most people tend to order out here but I always choose to eat in as the restaurant has a relaxed setting and the lighting gives it a calm mood. Don't overlook this place the next time you're craving some delicious fried chicken in Ktown.<//Text>

Always a smart decision to accompany it with a perfectly brown waffle with some syrup. Try to trick a friend into taking some atomic chili sauce on a wing an you'll be in for a nice comedy show as well.</review>< Pics>

Ordered through Door Dash. They gave my order to someone else. Waited an hour plus for someone to tell me that. The response from the restaurant was "we can remake it". No attempts to inject any apology or offer amends for their screwup. Because of all of this I didn't get dinner.

If this place ever goes out of business I'll hold a vigil at it's locked doors until the world ends. Been eating at both locations for years now - both eat in and delivery - and I've not had a bad meal yet. Don't expect stellar service, but do expect some crazy crispy chicken in all manner of tasty sauces. The spicy sauced boneless chicken is my favorite, but try the cheesling chicken with a side of honey mustard if your are super stoned and feeling adventurous.< /Review>

Love their soy garlic fried chicken, sweet and crunchy with a hint of spice. The skin is always crunchy and non greasy and the chicken meat is so yummy and juicy! Not a fancy place and hard to find parking nearby as the restaurants in the same plaza fill out the small lot fast.

Order their combo fries too! Amazing onion rings in the same batter as their fries, sweet potato fries and regular fries.</Text>

<Rating>2<//Rating><review>This is my opinion.

This place is an inconsistent HOT MESS.  It's like dating cRaZy.

A lot of the time, you will experience delay, disappointment, anxiety or stress.  But...once in awhile....

...cRaZy is fabulous, and they hit it out of the park.  That's how crazy keeps you on the hook.

With a $9.50 delivery charge, and illness after my last meal, I am not inclined to continue to roll the dice on which experience I will get.  If I lived nearby, honestly, I probably would roll the dice for a longer period of time...until I just had too many bad experiences in a row.

But isn't that the way it always goes when you date crazy?

How can I count the many ways chicken can be prepared.
I typically don't like to order chicken when I go out to eat because everyone is still scared of salmonella. I don't blame them for that but I do blame others for dry and overcooked chicken. With this place, they did what I like the most, dark meat. Chicken wings and drumsticks are dark meat so these were accompanied or slathered in sauce which makes for a better meal. Even the fried chicken legs are better than the Colonel. Better yet, BBQ Chicken should take the name of KFC. Korean Fried Chicken, done well. Just let me know when you want to work out on "leg day"!! I'll be your wing-man.< /review>

A different approach to fried chicken and man was it wonderfully delicious. I used to come here once every two weeks when I was in college. The service in passable, but the food is well done.

My usual is a Teri-Stick combo: 2 drumsticks, a salad, and a side of fried rice. I also order a pepsi and twist potato for good measure.

If you haven't had Korean style fried chicken, you need to try BBQ Chicken!< /review>

I am a doordash driver have been waiting for my customers food for 25 minutes. This is ridiculous. The two employees are working very slowly, laughing, and one was even EATING a chicken wing at one point. I mean, the wait is ridiculous. I haven’t tried the food but they customer service is poor enough that I don’t want to anymore.< /Text>

i wish I could give this place one star. They didn't give me what I ordered. Then after I called and told them that they had my order wrong they tell me that they wouldn't refund my money. To make it worse, the rice and chicken were both disgusting. Please find somewhere else to get your chicken from. This place just isn't worth it on any level.<//review>

You’re better off ordering by UberEats or GrubHub than dealing with the restaurant’s service.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2c7796df6ffd3:0x3d7f274cae7b69f</gmapID></record>

Worst restraunt ever. I never feel bad when I grab some chicken, but this place finally made me get angry. Servers were unkind and talked unfriendly. They gave undercooked chicken with burned skin and they said that was perfectly cooked. And they gave me diffrent menu.
If you want to taste legit korean chicken, just go other BBQ or go to korea. This place makes me uncomfortable.</Review>

If I could give this place a negative review believe I would. Went for take out, asked to use the bathroom and was informed it wasn’t in service, okay no big deal. While waiting another gentleman comes in places order and heads for the bathroom. Same owner doesn’t say a word. I immediately get up an walk over and say “I thought the bathroom wasn’t in service” he looks as if a deer lost in headlights. I start to walk over An he then says “I told you bathroom no work”. No the only difference between myself and the other party that used the restroom is the pigment in our skin. So I politely cancelled my order and will make it my life’s mission to but this place out of business. Scroll down an you see over stores of the racism felt by possible patoreons.</Review>

The food is so good but the service will ruin your night.  I have never met a waiting staff that was so apathetic. Owners please read the reviews.  The night I was there two sets of customers got so upset with the negligent waitress that the tried to confront her about her terrible service and when she did nothing they left audibly upset and one customer dumped their half finished plates  on the ground. These were not difficult customers until the waitress addressed them with pure ambivelance to their concerns, this would infuriate anyone.  My table had to get up and go to the counter 5 times to submit an order, to get our drinks, to refill the empty utensil cup, to get refills and to get our check. By the end of the night we were so confused that we did not know if it were a full service restuarant or a restuarant like Subway.  This is terrible because the chicken is so good.  It would almost be better if you only did take out and did not have the full dining part.  I can no longer recommend this place to my friends because I am to worried about their night ending on a bummer like mine. Please change this, your product is too good for you to blow your money on a waitstaff that could not care less if you failed.<//review>

They may have okay chicken, but their customer service is below par. Food is not prepared in the amount of time expected for a sit down restaurant.  Delivery guys have to wait longer for their food. Past their pickup expected time.  Male and female server tend to ignore delivery guys, and spend that time on their phones instead of working.<//Text>

Staff is inefficient, slow and rude! Customer service is the worst! My food was taking more than 25 min because all the staff were to busy closing cashier and counting sodas and taking notes at 10pm to close the restaurant at 12am! When i ask for my refund the young guy get angry hit the table and call bad names in japonese! I’ll never come back here at least in this location<//text>

The chicken is really good here.

Just don't eat here. You'll be waiting a decade.

Order way ahead for pickup, and just come and pick it up. You'll be happier.< /Review>

It was pretty empty on friday at 1 pm. Waited about fiveteen minutes for my meal. I ordered the half and half whole fried chicken and the twelve piece all the flavour wings. You can really tell that the chicken was fried well and fresh. Made me think the wait was not that long considering how many to go orders were ahead of me. Food and service was damn good. They should be rated much higher at least 4 stars.<//Text>

Very unprofessional people who work at the establishment. I would even consider some of the staff racist ! I was a paying customer who wanted to try a new chicken spot and got a bunch of attitude and dirty looks because my friend and I weren’t korean . The place was empty by the way and the man who was a cashier had no patience for us right when we walked in . I DONT recommend coming here if you want to try something new . There are several delicious chicken spots who treat all colors of life  equally . NEVER COME HERE , tried to talk to a manager and got an immature women who put me on speaker , Very rude and unprofessional .</text>

Hey.. you are so bad.. We ordered water after we finished the meal.. and even I couldn't see the bone in the water cup until I almost finished the water because of the ice on it. How could you see inside through video camera? Also, it was not actually a whole bone but It was the edge of the bone. It means there must be 10 bones in the stainless bucket.. If I were you I would say SORRY first before counting the bones. I rate one star not because of the bone but because of the poor service.< /Text>

{'time': 1464016537389, 'text': 'Hello,\nI remember that...you ordered 10 drumsticks, right?\nActually, me and my employees counted the bones that you left. There are ONLY 9 BONES left on the table, also, we checked the video camera in restaurant and the water cup was filled with only water when my employee served. I think you or the lady mistakenly put the drumstick bone in the water cup, because it was next to a stainless bucket for trash and bones. If you want. I can show you the video. Please let me know.\n\nThank you.'}<//response>

<Review>I am an Uber Driver. I was here to pick up a delivery. There was a wait so I headed to their restroom. An individual who I believe to be the owner then told me the restroom didn't "function". I explained I am with UberEATS and am working for Your business and proceed to the restroom which another Hispanic Uber Driver has just used. Once I get to the restroom the same person individual who was speaking to me prior ran up and shoved me to keep me out of the restroom. This establishment is extremely unprofessional and the only reason I can see that I was denied access to the restroom was because of my race. I will never do business here.<//Review>< Pics>

Not only was the food over cooked, but this restaurant has the worst customer service. I was so upset over the service, I got up and left the rest of my food on the table. I didn't even want to bring it home. Disgusting!<//review>

They have a DREADFUL valet parking with a with a dude with grey hair either armenian or mexican for sure not asian who YELLED AT ME, SCREAMED AT ME, CURSED AT ME, DISRESPECTED ME IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY when I was simply picking up food with my wife in the car and he tried to FORCE my wife out of the car and he tried to FORCE me to give him my car keys when there were PLENTY of parking spaces AND I have been here more than a dozen times and never had an issue before. The asian security is a very nice guy bur this other valet older guy is HORRIBLE...I would never ever in my life give my car keys to these type of guy---bad energy for my car,....driver/customer you have been warned.</Review>

Overrated. We ordered the fried chicken and boneless chicken, the fried chicken had little taste and the mild spicy boneless tasted more like Chinese than any sort of bbq or spicy sauce. The sweet potato fries were good and service was nice, but food was just meh overall.<//text>

<Response>{'time': 1434490001140, 'text': 'Hello,\nBBQ(Best of the Best Quality) Chicken Los Angeles uses only local grown, fresh chicken. We make every food from scratch and start to make when customers order. It take at least 20 min. to 30 min for pick up and 45 min to 60 min for delivery (Korean town area). Not a fast food restaurant at all. =)\n\nAbout the chicken size, we use local grown, fresh, young chicken wings and drumsticks which are more expensive than mid, large size because they taste much better.\n\nAlso, if you call in order directly, it is faster and comes with free side dipping or salad. Since LABite takes 30% of the order, we we do not proved free stuffs. Please call 213 739 41047 for the next order.\n\nThank you!'}<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>Did a delivery.   Came 5 minutes before the on-time on a Sunday (70 min. as cited by LABITE) ! Serviing sizes are small compared to what I've bought prepared at supermarket and at even fast food chicken places.  Crispy chicken is very crispy and 1/2 to 3/4 size of sm.  (3.5 if you don't like a lot oil and 4.5 if you love the oil - mild spicy was mildly hot - just right)  In bone tried in sauce chicken Honey and Garlic tasty very good but serving pieces were like 1/4 to 1/2 of a normal typical serving. Taste was 4.5, size  1.  Fortunately only two eating the $22 order so satisfied but if expected for a family of 4 you better have made some sides or such.  IF fast food did delivery for the sake of size and price would have gone that way - but... fast food has no delivery and this is a good food at a midlevel price (provided you make the sides - I did my own salad, cooked mixed Italian seasoned veges and chili powder seasoned rice).< /text>< pics>

아니 리뷰들 다 머리가 없네. 땅콩이 없는데 알러지가 어떠케 나냐? 그리고 애초에 치킨에 설명이 왜필요하고 치킨이 튀기는데 당연히 30분 이상 걸리지. 그러면 집에서 30분안에 튀켜서 먹어봐. 어케 돼나. 왜 말도안돼는거 올려서 사장님 힘들게하냐. 사장님도 사람이야. 장사하는 사람이니까 하고싶은말도 진상한테 못하지. 모유나 더 먹고와라 애기들아</Text>

I called after an hour and waited for delivery, but it didn't come after another 40 minutes, so when I called again, the order wasn't available. It's a place that tells you, but the person who answers the phone is too irresponsible.

(Translated by Google) I don't know why I delete my review,
Is there anything wrong with the company who said you didn't know from the beginning?
Instead of saying I'm sorry in writing all the time, I just say my fault, right? Are you nice? I said in a rather low voice,
They just said they didn't know?
Did I ask for a refund pad? Or did you say take responsibility?
He asked because he had a serious peanut allergy and asked him to check it because his whole body was upset?
But when he said he didn't know until the end, the manager said with a smile. Can my husband not be angry?
My face is swollen and I can't open my eyes.
Why can't I say clearly that there are no peanuts?
Would we be upset if a manager called it had dealt with it from the beginning?
You were ignoring my allergy? I think the boss should politely apologize and apologize for the part that the employee laughed at?
The staff are all different
I don’t know
Not only in America
I don't know, but are you sure you are allergic to peanuts?
This is what I play with now. I just don't know for the first time, so I'll change the manager. So why don't you explain the situation from the beginning?
I asked because my face was swollen and I had trouble breathing, so I had to take an allergy medicine. If I had made it nice there, I would have quit, saying I knew it.
Why aren't the employees unsure?
Allergy education
What's in the sauce
Are you not educated on notation?
Yes, okay. Yes, please hold the notation.

왜 제 리뷰를 지우는지모르겠으나,
처음부터 모르겠다고 말한 업체 잘못은 없나요?
지금도 내내 글로 미안하다는 말대신 내 잘못만 따지네요 그쵸? 나이스해요? 제가 오히려 낮은 목소리로 말했고,
그분들은 오히려 모른다는 이야기만 했는데요?
제가 환불 패달라했나요? 아니면 책임지라고했나요?
땅콩알러지가 심각한 사람이라 물어보고 온몸에 난리가 나서 확인 해달라고 햇는데요?
그런데 끝까지 모르겠다고 하더니 매니져 라는 분이 웃으면서 말하더라구요, 화를 남편이안낼 수가있을까요?
얼굴이붓고 눈을 못뜨는데?
땅콩이 없다고 분명히 말을 왜 못할까요?
매니져 라는 사람이 처음부터 그렇게 대처했다면 저희가 화를 냈을까요?
제 알러지를 무시하던데요? 사장님이라면 정중히 사과하고 직원이 비웃었덤 부분에 대해서 사과를 하셔야 하는거 같은데요 ?
직원 들 말이 다달라요
모른다 한굳에서 소스를 받는다
없다 미국에만 없다
모르겠다 근데 땅콩 알러지가 확실한가요?
이게 지금 저 갖고노는거죠 그냥 처음부커 모르겟다 매니져 바꿔주겟다. 그럼 처음부터 상황 설명을 해줬으면 안되나요?
얼굴이 붓고 숨쉬기힘들어져서 알러지약을 먹어야 하니물아봤고 거기서 나이스 하게했다면 제가 알겎다고 전허ㅏ릉 끊었을텐데요 그쵸?
왜그럼 직원들이 다모르나요 교육을 안하나요?
알러지에대한 교육
소스에뭐가들어가있는지
표기에대한 교육은 안하는가보죠?
네네 알겠습니다 네그럼 표기법 들고 계세요.< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I am a person who is allergic to peanuts.
When I ordered, I couldn't confirm it, and after I ordered it, I suddenly felt itchy and started to swell my throat, so I asked my husband to call and ask.
When I called at first, a man told my husband that we got sauce from Korea and used it. So you said you didn't know
When I went to the Korean site and checked it, there was peanuts
I was scared, so I took the allergy medicine right away, but my face didn't go down.
Then I called to check again,
I thought it had peanuts, but I asked if it was true that I didn't know what's in the sauce, and when a woman received it, they said that they don't have peanuts,
Then the manager answered the phone
They say they don't store the order.. I don't know if that makes sense, but when I say the order, I don't know if it makes sense, but it won't. And all of our staff don't know.
....?
I don't know what that means, but I'm all on my face right now and I'm allergic. So I think I should be careful.
He laughed and laughed at (fact) how do you know if the allergy is peanuts?
I'm... very serious...
....My husband was so angry that he would go visit right away...
I'm getting all over my face now... People allergic to peanuts
Never eat it... It seems you don't know if peanut allergy is so dangerous.....
Oh... people will just mark it in the future
Well, I'm not going to use it when we don't know. I know my physical condition, so I contacted you to confirm...
I could have really died... but it's so scary...

#It is said that the sauce is coming from Korea, and it is on the site because it is a mixed sauce of cans. It is not sprinkled on top. Once you enter the site, take a look and talk.

#Please think about what the manager said that if you have peanuts, you will not accept orders. Then, why did the manager say that you should not receive a peanut allergy if you have a peanut allergy?

저는 땅콩알러지가 심한 사람입니다.
제가 주문할때 확인을 못하고 주문하고 먹고나니 갑자기 몸이간지러우고 목이붓기시작하는거같아서 남편에게 얼른 전화해서 물어보라고 했습니다
처음에 전화했더니 남편에게 남자분이 우리는 한국에서 소스를 받아서 쓴다. 그러니 모른다 라고 했다는 거예여
한국 사이트 들어가서 확인해보니 땅콩이있더라구요
무서워서 바로 알러지 약을 먹었는데도 얼굴이가라앉지않네요.
그리곤 다시확인 하기위해 전화했어요,
땅콩이 있는거 같은데 소스에 뭐가들어가는지모른다는 말이사실이냐고했더니, 여자분이받으시더니 자기네는 미국들아가는건 땅콩이없다는 겁니다,
그러더니 매니져라는분이 전화를 받더니만
주문이뭐냐고 자기네는 주문서를 저장해두지않는다는겁니다..그게말이되는지모르겟지만주문한걸 말하니 그게말이되는지모르겠지만, 없을거다 그리고 우리 직원들은 다 모른다.
....?
그게 무슨말인지모르겠지만 내가지금 얼굴에 다 올라오고 알러지가심하다 그러니 조심해야할거같다 라니까
웃으면서 (팩트) 알러지가 땅콩인지 뭔지어떻게 아냐고 웃더라구요?
저...되게심하거든요...
....거기에 남편이너무화가나서 당장 찾아가겠다고...
전지금 얼굴 온통 난리나고... 땅콩 알러지있는분들
절대드시지마시고... 여기는 땅콩알러지가 그렇게 위험한지 모르시는거 같더라구요.....
참...사람들이 그냥 앞으로 표기하겟다
뭐 우리가 모른다 때쓸꺼가아니라 저는 제 몸상태를 아니까 확인 하기위해 연락 드린건데....
진짜 죽을수도 있었는데... 너무무섭네요...

So, on the Korean site, it is stated that there are peanuts.\nDid you have peanuts on the seasoned chicken you ordered? Wasn\'t it? There is no single place where peanuts are sprinkled at over 50 BBQ chicken stores across the country. Is there a place where other Korean-style seasoned chicken shops sprinkle peanuts? There is no single place to sprinkle peanuts. It is because of the peanut allergy.\nIn addition, out of the 300 Google reviews here, there is not one issue related to peanut allergy. Is this possible if we put peanuts in our store?\n\nWhen you called, you said you\'re coming tomorrow with a medical certificate, so if you come tomorrow, I\'ll show you the powder and sauce that I have in store. Since it is quarantined upon import, it is always attached to the contents of the contents. Of course, there are no peanuts in the contents.\n\nAnd how can you dare to laugh when your husband even swears next to you? The customer was so angry and screaming that the staff was very frightened, and the manager said as nicely as possible.\nThe submission menu clearly states "Before placing your order, please inform your server if a person on your party has a food allergy". If the customer said he had allergies, he would have remembered it when he received the order.\nIf you have any other questions or concerns, please come to the store tomorrow or leave your contact information.

(Translated by Google) I've eaten BBQ chicken in Korea and nowadays I think that the advertisement is too much thanks to the excessive PPL in the drama, but I still prefer Gyochon chicken because I want to eat it in the end, but I deliberately drove it for over 30 minutes. Even though it was more expensive than Korea because it was the US, the parts of the service were not good, like the other reviews. It was unkind because it was so popular, the taste was not as good as expected, and the service was also insufficient. I felt like I was deceived by PPL until I finished eating chicken.

한국에서도 BBQ치킨을 먹어봤었고 요즘 드라마에 지나친 PPL덕분에 광고가 너무 심하다고 생각을 하면서도 결국 먹어보고싶단 생각에 평소 교촌 치킨을 더 선호하지만 일부러 30분 넘게 운전하고 갔는데... 솔직히 맛은 기대보다 덜하였고 금액은 미국이라 한국보다 비싸다고 해도 다른 리뷰들 처럼 서비스에 대한 부분이 안좋았다.거리두기 유지하고 질문을 해도 메뉴에 대한 설명이나 대답이 불친절했다.40분 기다려서 사왔는데 주문이 그만큼 밀려서.. 바빠서 너무 인기가 많은 탓일까 불친절했다.맛도 금액대비 기대보다 부족했고 서비스또한 부족했다. PPL에 속은 기분이 치킨 다먹을때까지 지울수가 없었다.</review>

(Translated by Google) I ordered them online because they seemed to be delicious and I went looking for them.

When I talked to a female employee, I said that if I entered a card page online, I would have to call the number listed online to talk.

So my older sister calls the number that is on my order and I'm connected to the store I'm waiting for. I was working on Saturday and I was busy because she was one of them.

After all, if we can't pay this, we have to cancel it, but it's also a loss. . Maybe it was difficult. I wouldn't have permission either ...

Thanks to it, I spent a lot of time calming and feeling unpleasant.

This seems to be a system issue rather than an employee issue, and the reason I post is a request to make it more convenient and convenient to use.

(Original)
사람들이 맛있을 것 같다고 해서 온라인으로 오더를 하고 제가 찾으러 갔는데 마침 캐쉬가 없었었어요.

여자직원 분에게 이야기를 하니까 온라인으로 카드페이라고 입력했으면 온라인에 나와 있는 번호에 직접 전화를 걸어서 이야기를 해야한다고 했어요.

그래서 오더했던 언니가 나와 있는 번호로 전화를 하니까 계속 내가 기다리고 있는 그 가게로 연결이 되는거에요. 일하는 사람은 토요일인데 그 여자분 한분이라 바빴고, 물어보니 계속 온라인 오더를 도와주는 사람이 있을텐데..., 라고만  하면서 불분명하게 이야기 했어요

결국은 이렇게 페이를 못하게 되면 저희는 캔슬을 할 수밖에 없는데 그럼 여기도 손해이니 우리가 온라인 상으로는캔슬을 하고 우리가 오더한 음식들을 다시 여기서 캐쉬로 페이하게 해달라고 했더니 잘 모르겠다는 식으로 yes or no 도 못하시더라구요 . 아마 곤란했겠죠. 본인도 권한이 없을테니....

덕분에 시간을 너무 많이 고요했고 기분도 불쾌했습니다.

이건 직원문제라기보다는 시스템 문제인것 같고 글을 올리는 이유는 좀 더 개선이 되어서 편리하게 이용할 수 있게 해달라는 요청입니다 .<//review>

The taste is crispy and good. Fried recommended

<Date>1601344697883</Date><rating>5</rating><review>I was driving with my family on hwy5 and we got a flat in the front. It was night and everyone was closed so I had roadside assistance swap  one of my rear dually tires to the front just so that I could drive 35 miles to the nearest tire shop and it happened to be Ramon's shop. We spent the night there and the next morning I called the number in the front to see what time they opened. Ramon answered the phone and unfortunately they were closed but he went out of his way and met us at  the shop just to change our tire. Great guy! He saved our day.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

Hit a pothole on I5 and blew a tire (shame on CALTRANS) The guys at Ramon's got me right in and fixed me up with a new pair.  Gave me a military discount as well!  Very friendly, great prices, excellent service.< /Text>

<text>This place saved us from having to camp out over 200 miles from home. They were so friendly and helpful! I'm happy to have discovered this place even under the circumstances of a blown tire on a long journey. They got us back on the road QUICK! I really don't have enough words of gratitude for them. Thank you so much for the help!< /text><username>Alegría h</username></record></dataset><record>

OMGoooosh!!! Where to start...After my RV blowout they came to rescue us with their off the road side service truck fully equipped to get us back on the road. Needless to say we drove to their shop to get 3 more tires. They were all such a friendly, nice,  fast, and helpful staff!< /Text>

<review>I wanted to express how amazing this tire shop was. We blew a truck tire on our way to Pismo Beach on a Saturday night right before Easter. They were willing to stay open late to help us and got us back on the road in an hour and a half with four brand new tires. The staff was very nice and Professional. We can not be more greatful for their generosity!< /review><name>Jeremy Godfrey<//name><rate>5<//rate>< userid>

I feel it incumbent upon me to share my experience with Ramon's Tire and Auto in Mondota, CA.  On 12/17/2017 I was driving the 5 heading north on a long road trip to Oregon when the flat tire icon appeared on the dash.  It was 5pm when I arrived at the McDonald's with a flat tire.  It was getting dark and it was SUNDAY.  I called 2 other companies who did not answer the phone, but Adrian Gonzalez of Ramon's did.  He assured me that he would likely be able to fix the tire, but that he was 20 minutes away.  To my surprise, he agreed to travel up to the McDonald's to meet me and was able to fix my tire on the spot.  He removed the tire from the vehicle, patched it, and I was back on the road.  When I was up the road a couple exits the light came on again.  I called Adrian.  I don't know this man.  I didn't know him then and I don't know him now.  But he turned around and came directly to help me for a second time!  As it turns out I just needed to drive for a while for the sensor to reset or something, which it did.  It is now January 19th and that tire is still going strong.  Thank you Sir.<//text>

<Text>Been here many times and service is good. Everything is good.

Only reason for low review is because outside on a banner says they are open 8am - 8pm...and Google also says till 8pm

But at the door the urgent care really ends at 5pm...

So of course, I went here with severe chest pains and I just wanted to make sure I wasn't having a heart attack...after a uber ride...and to my disappointment, they were actually closed.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Do not go here unless it is a last resort or for urgent care services. Their family medicine side bills as urgent care and they don't own up to their mistake. Do not use them for primary care services.

Used to be good and my first visit was fine but they will incorrectly bill insurance and not own up to their mistakes. You will also wait forever for the doctor to see you and then the Dr rushes the visit.<//review>

I’ve never had such a disappointing experience at an urgent care. I had something check out that needed x rays, they sent me to 4 different x ray facilities because one didn’t even have x rays apparently and the other said their machine was down. Once I was able to get the x rays done, they said they sent them right away and when I never received a call from the urgent care in 24 hours, I called them. The lady on the phone had an attitude and accused me of thinking that she was lying about receiving them, yet when I called the facility there’s x rays were done, they said they sent them over. It took 3 days to find out what happened and I had to call them, they never called me. Never going there again.</text>

They were extremely efficient which could be viewed as positive, but if you want more interaction I would not recommend this place. The nurse was with me for maybe two minutes and the doctor was about the same.

I called to try and get a note for work so I could go back and was told I would need to come in a second time to be reevaluated. I'm not paying another 90$ for you to write a note.< /text>

You need to pay for the covid testing $120 that was really unexpected. Covid testing must be free with no cost.<//text>

We used to go to Sunrise Medical and then I spotted this care facility. I feel like I walked into a new world. From the spotless facility, the helpful staff, to the extremely patient and helpful doctors. I have 3 little kids and the doctors always take time to make them feel relaxed.

But they also don't just give you a generic answer.  They diagnose your condition. ..not just push you through the door like Sunrise would. always a pleasure.</review>

I call at 7:20pm asking "do you take Humana HealthCare Partners Insurance" Leann (who answered phone) states yes, we just have to verify your insurance.  We close at 8 pm so you have to be here by 7:3.  I rush down there get handed a 3 page package to fill out.  Gave her my insurance card and ID.  After filling out 1 1/2 pages, Leann
calls me up to front desk and says we dont take your insurance.  You can pay cash.  I state "you said over phone yes, you take Humana Healthcare Partners and now you dont?  Oh, she states -  I told you I had to verify.

Anyone would think "verify'? to see if its valid.  Can you imagine that answer to anyone and everyone who calls?  Driving down there and finding out they do not accept your insurance after calling and asking if they do.

Now for the reason I rushed right down there.  I hit my head hard walking into a broken branch on a tree.  Im on Eliquis (a blood thinner) and I was bleeding profusely.  Was hoping PACIFIC URGENT CARE to get it to stop put in a stitch or two and be on my way.  Now I will have to go to Anaheim Hospital, be down there for hours.  Let alone the drive there.  If she Leann had said NO we do not accept Humana HealthCare Partners I would have went elsewhere to begin with.  Really very upset with Pacific Urgent Care.
FUNNY, LEANN seemed smug, smiling, very uneffected.</Review>< userid>

My husband and I actually prefer to go here rather than a PCP. We're pretty healthy people so no major illnesses but we've always gotten what we need when we go there. I really like Dr. Amer! The staff is always friendly and you're in and out fast!</Text>

Me and my family have been here over the past few years and always receive excellent service. They can take an xray if necessary. The staff and doctors are always kind and helpful. Great alternative for non emergency care.< /Text>

What a great place. I went during my lunch break and was back at the office within the hour. The place is clean and everything seems new, from the furniture to the medical equipment. The staff was very nice. They offered me a bottled water as I waited.  Dr. Amer was kind and thorough. She took the time to answer my questions and explain her diagnosis. She was not rushed and impersonal like many other doctors I have been to. She sent my prescriptions to my local pharmacy, so they should be ready for me to pick up on my way home from work. Excellent care.<//Review>

Good place for quick doctor visits, the place is clean and simple. I go here all the time for infections or common antibiotics needs.

If you need quick prescriptions or are out of towner. They will take care of you, anything serious follow up with primary doctor.</Review>

<text>I walked and identified myself with my insurance card and my ID. The girl in the front gave me the card and ID and rejected my information for she said I needed to go to a different clinic. I called my insurance  to report and Nancy told me to hold and yes she confirmed my coverage and I went back in and reregistered . These helpers don’t know how to do their job and they have  an attitude . I’ve been waiting for more than 40 minutes and they don’t even have too many patients.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Never been, but won't pick up phone and their message system is full. Usually a good indicator that they don't care about the people they serve if they can't even bother calling back.<//Text>

I selected a Dr there as my PCP. They are very quick! You will be in and out with in 15-20 min. I was very impressed initially. However, they do not take your medical history in detail nor they requested medical records from previous Dr.
The Dr couldn't even diagnose me correctly. My condition deteriorated, and I had to get second opinion.
Additionally, they want to charge me extra in addition to my Co-Pay.
It appears they are in the business to only make money.

I would not get them as PCP.</Review>

I had bad experience with this clinic
First of all I was in other clinic and I come here because it’s near from my work place
I have a kind of sciatica
I saw the doctor Zhen lu
Actually he didn’t treat me well and he never smile and look like don’t like to see me ,
I start to explain him that I was in other clinic , he interrupt me and say “ so why you are here “
Any way I told him I need to get another opinion here and better treatment
So he just spent 2 minutes with me and ask his assistant to give me injection  “dexamethasone “
I was looking online for that I heard many bad news about and the side effect us that , but the doctor didn’t tell me anything about that .
Any way the doctor say that I need to follow up next day  , so I come next day and I asked to see the doctor , the receptionist told me that I need to pay again for another visit , that’s really wired plus that she continued to inform me that the doctor will not be available till next Tuesday and today is Wednesday, so basically I have to wait almost one week to see my doctor again and he is the one who ask me to follow him up next day , that’s really sad and bad
After that I asked the receptionist to send message for doctor and let him even communicate me via phone to at least explain to me about the medication, but sadly nobody call me back and basically nobody cares about me
It’s wasting time and wasting money without any benefits<//Text>

If you can, go somewhere else. They were useless. He barely touched my mom's head, after saying she had fallen and had a lump. She also had an unrelated issue other face and he didn't even look at it, just said put hydrocortisone on it. Looking at it from across the room. Super flippant and useless.  I understand recommending er for her head, but he was so flippant and didn't even examine her. I have had decent doctors in the past but it is hit or miss.< /Review>

Although I was seen fairly quick, the doctor told me I would go into a coma if I wasn't properly hydrated. He sent me to the ER, where I was told this wasn't true and me going there was completely unnecessary.</text>

I've been here several times. Mostly they are ok the best doctor on their staff is the older Indian gentleman. He is quick and takes care of the problem asap.  They had a black lady doc at one time and she really had a 'tude . Actually refused to give me a torodal shot ( non opiate) for a migraine. Glad SHE'S gone. I'd rank them second in quality in Orange area. OC Urgent Care is number one< /Review>

We've been going for years now and it's always our favorite. Even if you get there to a long line, it's so interactive there's never a dull moment or an overly bored child.< /review>< time>

<review>Spectacular Christmas experience. Helps remind us of what Bethlehem was in the day Jesus was born.

Love that various churches partner together to share the true reason for the Christmas season.  Each year it gets better. The actors bring the times alive, live animals including camels and angels dancing and singing above the live manger are magical.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

It's a wonderful event to experience the story of birth of Christ. Lots of petting opportunities for kids. We found chicken, cow, bull, sheep, goat, peacock, bunnies, donkey, pony, horse, camels, lama lama and many other. It had old style school, dances, pottery, blacksmith, market, bakery, carpenter, hotel and finally beautiful barn with baby Christ, Mary, Joseph surrounded by angels.. have to visit every year</Review>

It was a fantastic event. Everything was well planned and executed. Kudos to the angels who were dancing in the cold outside for so many hours. It was perfect. Reliving the feel of Bethlehem was a surreal experience. I really wanted my daughter to experience this, a far cry for the candies, gifts and the commerce that this time of the year involves. She adored petting the animals. I cant wait for next year! Thank you again to everyone for their hard work.< /text>

I love going to this. Been about three times. They put such a good amount of work into this. They really do a good job. Don't wait too late to go though because we went on the last day around 8pm and spent a good 45mins in line. And then felt rushed through it.<//Review>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>15 minutes before closing time, and these dudes are standing outside the store.  The store was already locked up, and all I hear is the guys smirking over the fact that they closed.  Realizing they were workers from GS. Must be nice to close when ever you feel like it.

this is the worst one.

staff has a crappy attitude..
but that mite be the managers fault.

75% of the games are USED
and if something is wrong with your game..
they will NOT give you your MONEY back..
they will give you 15% credit : /

multiple bad experiences here.
gamestop is the new BlockBuster.
and that's not good.<//Review><user_name>Adam Divine<//user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x80c2cf4e6cb51fa9:0x3538bda8fa79dd5< /gmapID><date>1427903531477<//date>< Rating>

<Text>Update:

The *NEW* staff are garbage out of 3 people (nearly always "working") only 1! is ever doing the register while the other 2 float around. And that is annoying since it has decent amount of people daily so why not use that man power to actually get us in and out.

And no its not that the longer your in a store the more you want to buy, blah, blah... blah. I wouldn't mind waiting in line IF it were just 1 person working but SINCE they have 2 registers + 3 people working... yeah I think that is just idiotic.

This remind me of the ways that blockbuster and other stores used to be run... haha

=======
A year older review than the update

Good people at the store friendly and some know their stuff. Others not as much as I would like to from a gaming store.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

This store is cool for retro GameStop and systems but overpriced for sure. Customer service here is okay as well.<//text>

<Text>Oh my!!! Unfortunately, I have returned to HAI.  Since my last visit at the beginning of this horrible pandemic I must say that they have made a complete turnaround. I was in awe on the improvements and cleanliness of this establishment.  Very professional staff and detailed procedures which made my visit very pleasant.< /Text>< pictures>

As a resident of Hanford,  I want to thank all the staff. Especially the x-ray staff for their kindness and professionalism.  For a small town, we have all the the experience and expertise that a big city could offer. Thank's again to all the staff at Hanford Imaging.</review>

<time>1614906947543<//time><Rating>4<//Rating><text>Great experience! Quick to set up appointments and confirmation notification. Short waiting time for appointment overall. The staff are efficient. Only downside is that I got a personal call, an automated call, text message reminders, email reminders and that was all a little too overwhelming! That’s the only thing I would change. One notification is good enough. Can fill out forms online prior to the appointment so that helps speed the waiting process.</text>< pics>

I was actually redirected to Hanford Advanced Imaging due to insurance coverage.  I was very pleased with my experience. The staff was very professional and courteous.  The office was very well kept and up to current covid standards.  My X-ray technician Ari was very kind and thorough.  I will most definitely recommend Hanford Imaging to others that are settling for the less than optimal experience at the other option in town.< /review>

The staff were professional and polite. The service was prompt and efficient. My appointment started on time and there was no waiting after being called. Most places call you from the waiting room late and place you in a room to wait even longer. I am very happy with the professionalism displayed.</Review>

New Patient here. From the beginning of scheduling my first appointment to walking out after my scanning appointment was complete, these girls/ office did a fabulous job! The calls, text messages , reminders, checking in, filling out paperwork , atmosphere while waiting for my scan, friendliness of the office staff to the friendliness of the tech preforming the ultrasound, was very pleasant & professional. Being a new patient, recently diagnosed with a specific condition can be very nerve racking, fearful and down right uncomfortable... but these gals made the appointment go by quickly & answered any questions I had in the meantime. I would highly recommend Hanford Imaging! Thank you ladies again!</Text>

Four stars because the communication between my referring physician and Hanford Imaging took longer than necessary. Otherwise, everyone on the day of the appointment was professional and friendly and the procedure was well-explained and executed. Their facility is conveniently located amongst all the various Hanford medical facilities.< /text>

Much more reasonably priced than the competition, lots of room in the lobby for social distancing, all the employees were kind and courteous. The only problem I had was getting information in advance. Their calls seem to go to an answering service and depending on who I spoke with I got conflicting information. Also it took multiple calls to finally get an answer about pricing. But the procedure itself went smoothly and efficiently. The tech was very professional and helpful. I will go back if I need future imaging.< /text>

I had an ultrasound scan of my leg due to swelling. To try and identify the source of the issue. I arrived a out 20 minutes early per instructions. Did the paperwork.  Waited a few minutes was called in for the scan. The technician was very professional and considerate.  The Scan was quicker than I expected.</review>

Very good staff and very bad phone system.

Your technician,  Ariadne, is a breath of fresh air.  Cheerful,  friendly,  helpful,  and patient. And she remembered my name from a previous visit. You should clone her.

Your telephone system,  on the other hand is awful and should be scrapped and replaced by a customer- friendly one manned by real people rather than robots. I hate it so much that I've considered using a different provider for my imaging services.< /text>

My appointment was at 6:00am! What a wonderful thing to not have to wait in a waiting room, take time off of work, and spend hrs out of the day for a 20min MRI.

Thank you Valley Imaging for a great start to the day!</Review></record>

It was an experience I won't forget anytime soon. Dr was excellent in his expertise. Nicest dr ever. Explained everything in detail what he would do, when he was doing it, constantly asking if I was ok. Apologizing for any pain he caused. I do wish he had given me more pain number because I did feel the needle going in neck 3 times. It was quick but uncomfortable. I have had biopsies 2 times before. On way home I started losing my voice. I am putting ice on neck and it seems to be getting better. Sites are sore but will go away. There is some bruising but I will live. So glad I had such an expertise. I heard him say nodulecwas so close to vessel. Kind of scary but I had faith in this dr, one, because Dr Sahas sent me to this dr., two, because he told me he had done this for 35 years.</Review>

<review>Yesterday was my second time going to get a MRI, the first time honestly it was traumatic because I had no idea the machine makes loud noises. Yesterday I was close to cancel my appointment,  I was very nervous,  but because I really need it done I went, and the nice guy that was doing the MRI was very kind, he had no idea about how I was feeling,  he used extra pads to cover my ears, and I think I fall asleep 🙈🙈. So, thank you very much! Also the girl at front desk is very nice! 🙏🌻🙏< /review></record></dataset><record>

My doctor's office had not fax a copy of my referral and they could not obtain it  because the fax machine was not working at Hanford Imaging??After arriving for my x ray I had to go to my doctor's office to get a copy...Who runs a business without a fax machine..??? Very inconvenient for me!!!!< /Text>

You call their number and you get robot directory and on hold for 20 minutes or so to talk to a live person. Appears they are either unorganized, understaffed or both. Plus side , facility is modern and clean.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

Waited over an hour.  The place was not even busy.  There were only eight chairs in the waiting area and the whole one hour that I was there waiting, some of the chairs were sometimes unoccupied.  Then few people that came in way after I did got called in first.  After (somewhat) the 5th patient got called in (way after I checked in), I knew something was off.  I had to say something to the front staff.  Odd that after I said something, suddenly I was the next customer.  Hope VA never send me to this facility again.</review>

I have visited Hanford Imaging, unfortunately several times in the past three years obviously due to health issues. But regardless of being in their office several times, the staff at every level is consistently courteous and very professional. I’ve seen different faces and familiar faces.  It doesn’t mater new or veteran I am always treated with respect and feel a genuine concern from every staff member.< /Text>

<Text>I went for a biopsy this morning.  The receptionist was welcoming and efficient.  The ultrasound technician was kind and completed my exam quickly.  The doctor who performed my biopsy was just incredible.  He was honest, thorough and compassionate.  He took his time but didn't waste a minute.  He was complimentary towards his assistant (same ultrasound tech).  This experience was so much better than expected.  I highly recommend Hanford Imaging!</Text>< pics>

Very nice and clean facility.  I was greeted kindly, politely, and with a smile.! The facility is strict on covid procedures, masks, 6 feet apart and it has plenty of hand sanitizer. I was amazed that they had a place for clean ink pens and a place for dirty ink pens.  I was escorted to the back room and given very thorough, and understandable directions by the MRI TECH.  He then came and got me and escorted me to the room for my MRI.  The Tech is very polite, listens to your concerns and accommodates you if you have pain or other issues.  He is also very knowledgeable and takes your care seriously.   I would recommend this facility to all my family and friends.   One thing I was not happy about was there was no headphones with music to listen to. MRI machines are loud even with the earplugs he gives you to wear, take time to put your earplugs in very good. They have handicap access, parking and bathrooms. Do get there early because there is a lengthy history to fill out about your medication, surgeries you have had and dates.  The MRI machine is a capsule type set up that you are sent into so if your clostraphobic get medication to calm you before you go.
Thank you to the Tech and Front office lady for a pleasant procedure< /text>

<text>Great experience here. The receptionist at the front desk checked me in and caught a mistake in my insurance paperwork that would have cost me over $400. I ended up paying less than $100. Thanks to her thoroughness, I only spent a small fraction of what was quoted me on the phone. My MRI went smooth.They made me feel very comfortable throughout my time there. I’m very pleased with Hanford Advanced Imaging.<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Gmap_id>

I was very disappointed with my experience.  I went in for an ultrasound,  I'm 38 weeks pregnant with my first and only child. The technician did not want to answer any of my questions.  And when she was done just simply said she did not take any pictures for me. This is my last ultrasound and I didn't even get to see my baby.  This was very sad for me.  Also if you can put rails on the wall or somehow make it easier for someone to help themselves sit up. That would be nice. At 38 weeks sitting up from a flat surface is very hard and painful when you have to hold your pee. These are the things that bothered me the most.</text>

Technician was excellent and very professional.  Easy 5 STARS ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️for her. They were timely and once scheduled it wasn’t a long wait.  BUT 2-3 STARS ⭐️⭐️ is for the process of getting scheduled.  Trying to get an X-ray done when they don’t take appointments wasn’t easy.  3 attempts before I succeeded.  You have to arrive at least an hour early and wait outside but no one tells you this.  Multiple people (4-5 out of 10-12)were experiencing the same issue.  We had to wait outside as a group until 12:30 when they accepted X-ray patrons.  A bit awkward not wanting to rush in before others.  IMPORTANT!! If you don’t arrive an hour early you come when they tell you that they start scheduling X rays and ITS BOOKED UP FOR THE DAY.  It can’t be fun for the girls who have to send us away.  After you do manage to get there in time, you are given another time to come back.  Happy not to have to stay and wait, but plan ahead if you are out of town. Maybe a bit more information about the process would be wonderful!! Hope this helps! 😊<//text>

<Text>I’ve been to the facility prior to the pandemic and the staff was great then. Now, during the pandemic and comparing to my dentist office you really don’t see any major difference from the set up to the checking in process. I mean everyone uses the same pen to use for registration and checking in and the cloth seats are well cloth seats that everyone uses going in and out. But once again the staff was outstanding cute, nice and professional. Just not that many changes to put patients at ease that someone isn’t wiping snot on your chair or on the pen and placing back in the bin. Better to have chairs that can be easily wiped down and a clean and dirty pen bin. But, like I said In the beginning still great overall service.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Gmap_id>0x8094c39b18e1011b:0x3ce7ee1ec93232d6< /Gmap_id><user>115861178820090540054< /user>< resp>

Was referred here for X-Rays and an ultrasound. The office staff was very friendly and helpful when I called with questions, as well as when I arrived. The Technician was very friendly. Got in and out in a reasonable time. No complaints.</review>

We had an amazing experience. We went in for an unexpected ultrasound after my doctor could not find the babies heart beat . They were so kind to us . Did the ultrasound and after finding the heartbeat strong and baby measuring perfect , even allowed my active duty navy husband to come in and see the only ultrasound he is going to get to see of our baby . He deploys in 3 weeks from Jan -July . I’m due July 16. So he literally would not of got to see the baby live. We are so thankful for the patience and kindness of the tech and Hanford advanced imaging .</text>

It was fine except I had to wait at least 20 min to be called in and I know it is not that bad whe waiting but if u have a full bladder I think they could hurry up on the check up. If it was a patient that can hold the bladder of not spilling out by with me I had radiation due to rectal cancer my muscles are not good in contracting but so far with the ultrasound the lady Jenny was great in handling my situation</text>

I was there the other day for an X-ray for my daughter. I drove there from out of town and the girl upfront said for me to come back in 2 hours. I explained that I came from out of town, it’s over 100 out and we can’t drive back home and make it back in time for two hours. She then suggested I drive around for two around and come back. I came back two hours later. We signed in and waited another two hours there in the office just to find out the xray machine had broke. A lady at the front desk told us that we all had to leave. I explained my situation again and said how frustrating this was and she had said for me to call back again another time and see if the xray ray machine was working again and if it was she would fit me into the schedule so I didn’t have to come in as a walk in again. So I call back a day later and a woman named Lauren answered. I explained to her my situation and she said the machine is up but they only do walk ins. I explained how I was told I would Be given an appointment time or “fitted into the schedule” as the other lady had put it. Lauren’s response was “well we don’t do appointments and it’s still walk in only and there’s one person here now!” ...... I’m coming from out of town 🤷🏼‍♀️ This Lauren lady was something else. I understand that she may be busy but that’s not a reason to be rude and short with me. Your suppose to be a health care professional Lauren 🙄< /Review>

<Review>Helpful and friendly check in with front desk receptionist.
Sonogram tech quickly and professional administered the sonogram test for deep vein thrombosis.
The supervising Doctor at Hanford Advanced Imaging explained the test results to me and passed on those results to my, Dr. Ashok.<//Review>< GmapID>

Appointment was at 11:20, with 11:00 arrival time requested by imaging center. I was on time and had my paperwork filled out online prior to appt., I was still not called back for a CT until an hour later. The wait times are really slow. However, the tech who performed my CT was awesome.</review>

<Review>My appointment went so well. I walked in and was greeted by name by the front desk associate who was pleasant, informed and helpful. I arrived early (545 am) to fill out paperwork and was immediately called back once completed. The Tech explained everything thoroughly and walked me through each step of my procedure completely. I felt comfortable, appreciated for my service and valued. The entire exam was over in 45 minutes which was less time than i expected. Great customer service today. Good job Hanford Imaging.</Review>< pictures>

<Review>I had a very good experience today when I came for an x-ray. Even as I came into the driveway, I was thinking how clean the grounds looked. Very good to see too.
I walked in and found that it was very nice looking. The front desk girls had on cute makeup and horns that were pink. They were polite and very helpful.
The radiologist was very kind and had a great mannerism that made me comfortable. I didn't want long and I was on my way.
I would give Hanford Advanced Imaging 5 stars plus. Very professional and I thank each of them for caring.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Gmap_id>0x8094c39b18e1011b:0x3ce7ee1ec93232d6< /Gmap_id>< response>

<text>The MRI technician was very nice. I am happy to say that the medical areas are much cleaner than the lobby. The carpets and furniture in the lobby and internal waiting areas were visibly dirty. Plants and other decor was layered in dust. A deep cleaning is in order for sure. It seems like modernizing the office has not been a priority including check in processes.

The staff were nice and the medical experience was acceptable. Like I said, I was pleased that the rooms where MRI machines and procedures took place were clean and much more acceptable than the waiting areas.</text></record>

< Review>
I have been to Hanford imaging several times now. While I understand many places use call centers for their appointments, this gets rather confusing and frustrating sometimes as the people answering the phone don’t always have all the information that they need. Although they are always pleasant.
The people that work at this facility always seem very pleasant, very professional, and the wait is never long.
This facility has always been kept clean and smells fine and nice. You’re always greeted pleasantly and with a smile no matter how busy they are.
I hope the owner of this business would consider looking  into new chairs, maybe was time to replace them/their cushions a long time ago😉
Facemasks are required right now but nobody is taking temperatures. A lot of us though have found out that facemasks are not good for our health in general……< /Review>

Dr. S. Athale was a wonderful doctor. He explained on what he was about to do during my biopsy. I felt safe while he was doing the procedure. To all the staff(especially Nurse Marisa) that help us during our visit. Thank you for a wonderful experience. May God bless you all. Have a wonderful day.</text>

She took in to consideration that without my hearing aids I could’ hear very well and made sure she looked directly at me so I could read her lips. Gave me double hearing protection so I wouldn’t lose what little hearing I do have left. Excellent service. Thank you very much.< /text>

Worst receptionists ever! Extremely poor front desk service.  The girls don’t make eye contact, don’t answer the calls that are transferred from the hub. Don’t call back and are anything but helpful. The reception area is filthy & not well kept at all.  Now the techs are great. Very friendly, helpful, maybe they should be the first people patients see rather than the young ladies who act like you are in invisible.  Too much competition out there to provide such terrible customer service.<//Text>

<text>Staff were very pleasant, friendly, and efficient. I was in and out in no time. I arrived early as I was unfamiliar with the location. I was taken back as soon as my paperwork was completed. I was actually done at the time of my appointment. The technician ask me about a follow up appointment with my physician and I told her I had an appointment on Monday and this was Friday. She said she would make sure the report got there in time for my appointment. I would definitely recommend this facility< /text>< Pictures>

Waiting time in the waiting room was quick and the receptionist was nice. When taken back for my CT, the Technologist was very kind and understanding especially for me being hard of hearing. My overall experience at the imaging center was very good, compared to some places I’ve been to in the past<//Text>

< review>
It was my first experience doing a MRI. I did my best not to move. I understand it is important. A lot of good information can be derived from good scans. It is also important for good communication from the operator. Keeping the patient informed about when it is possible to  adjust position to alleviate discomfort would help expedite the procedure. Hanford Imaging should understand not everyone is claustrophobic, everyone is different and should be treated uniquely so. A small amount of time should be dedicated to getting familiar with whom they are dealing with to insure proper care and consideration is given to each individual. The operator immediately following the end of the session started saying that I was doing excessive amount of moving around. I believe i was not . I felt like  the scans were not of good quality and that he was starting to make excuses for himself. I was unable to have any discussion with him because of his time scheduled. He was starting to prepare for his next customer. If anyone actually reads this comment and is genuinely interested in a intelligent critique i would be available  to speak to a person that is in a supervisor position. Thank you.<//review>

The ladies at the front desk were very friendly and professional. I arrived later in the day and their times were filled up but when they heard I drove from porterville, the technician agreed he would stay late for me rather than have me make another trip. He was also very professional and caring. I would recommend them to others.</Review>

It was my 1st MRI my wait in the lobby was super quick. The tech was very informative on the process and what it does. I did get a little anxious at one point and I thought that if the headphones had music it would be easier to relax. But overall it was a good experience with a very professional staff<//Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>The Doctor and his staff were generally concern about my health. They explained the procedure and made sure I was comfortable with it. They answered my questions and concerns without hesitation.  The best part for me was the prayer at the beginning of the procedure asking the good Lord for wisdom and guidance in treating me. I'm still recovering and hoping with each passing day the pain with go away. Thank you again.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

As soon I went to the counter, about 1:30, I gave the girl at the counter my paperwork and she told me to have a seat. About a hour and a half later I asked another girl if I had to check in. She ask me who I was. I told her my name and she said she had no record of me. I explained to her that I had given my paperwork to another girl. The girl at the counter said I didn’t have an appointment. I told her QTC sent me and they should have the paperwork. I guess they looked around and finally found my paperwork. She said it’s going to be awhile because I had three people ahead oh me. I drove a hour to get there and I waited 2.5  to be seen. That’s unsat on any level. Bad service. Another man in Spanish said to the counter that they made him feel like a criminal and walked out. The office needs a new manager. She didn’t come out once when I was there. In the middle of my x-ray she walked in to talk to the tech. I professionally as hell. I will never go to your office again. I will let QTC know as well.<//Text>

The X-ray tech, Mike was incredible. Professional at every level. Very focused on my comfort and confidence. The doctor explained the procedure in incredible detail and ensured plenty of time for me to answer questions I never felt rushed or pressured at all. My pain in my left leg was immediately relieved and I am very happy with the results. I would highly recommend this staff and facility to my friends and family.</Review>

After having my appointment canceled 3 times, i arrived at my forth appt 15 minutes early.  Then I waIting an hour before hour.  I went up to the desk to ask why I was still waiting.  I was seen within 10 minutes.  My procedure was handled in a professional manner & in a timely fashion.  I was very satisfied with my treatment.  Not so happy with my waiting time.< /review>

Very professional sweet staff. They made a mistake on my schedule and they all felt bad about it. I wasn’t even upset waiting for a few hours because of all the apologies. I was extremely nervous about the biopsy, but they all put me at ease. Highly recommend them to anyone!< /Review>

Warning! Two new receptionists! I went in for a CT scan and an X-ray. After the CT scan the receptionist said she didn’t “notice” my X-ray order on the other side of the paper and that I would have to take off the hospital gown, get dressed, and go back into the lobby and wait behind the other the four people that came after me. Then- after my X-ray, I asked the other receptionist if my CD was ready. She dismissed me and said “whatever they told you back there.....” So, I asked if she would please check the two cds on the counter. After glaring at me, she paused for a long moment, then picked them up and said “oh-yeah, they are yours”</Review>

The staff was friendly and welcoming. The ultra sound tech was a little rough on my ultra sound of my throat and they ran out of topical anesthesia for my procedure. However my biopsy was quick and the Doctor was comforting during the very quick procedure.<//Review>

< Review>
My plesent visit at Hanford Advance Imaging started at the front desk when I was greeted by two very nice young ladies one who checked me in. While I waited to be seen I was able to be informed of the world news on the 📺 and that was pretty cool and made the wait not so bad. After noticing me struggle to go to and come from the front desk a very nice lady in the waiting lobby with me offered to take the clipboard back up for me. The radiologic technologists ( not 💯% sure if that is the correct term but I'm trying to say the guy who took my xrays) was a very nice gentleman gave me two gowns so I wouldn't be cold and was very polite and made the painful experience of getting xrays not so so bad. All in all I very much recommend Hanford Advanced Imaging and should I need any of their services in the future witch I hope I won't lol but if i did I with no doubt am going back here.<//Review>

from the very early appt, the front staff was extremely nice, very informative & inviting. The staff in the back was beyond helpful, made the lengthy & loud MRI process almost like taking a nap. I’m so very impressed by these ladies & they deserve 5 gold stars!!!!< /Review>

I was told to be 20 minutes early to my scheduled appointment time, therefore I arrived 30 minutes early. However, I did not get taken back until an hour after my scheduled appointment time. The staff in the back was friendly and informative. Ari & Daniel were wonderful!< /Review>

Appointment on July 17th for MRI. Couple days later called to pick up disc and ask if copy was sent to my Doctor, had to leave message as no one answered. As of time writing this still not any word from Hanford Imaging. Costly and recommended procedure means nothing if findings not discussed.</Text>

The staff was VERY friendly, kind, and courteous. It was my first time using Hanford Imaging and I will definitely use them for all my imaging needs. They answered all my questions, I did not have to wait long to be seen, and I left very happy and satisfied with their services. The office is clean, neat, and has plenty of parking in the front and side.</text>

This is the second time in a year i have had to deal with this office and both have been HORRIBLE experiences. In October 2018 I waited over 4 hours while staff had a birthday celebration, and as of today I was called yesterday to come at 8:30 as i’d be pulled back by 9AM. The staff said oh it will be an minimum of 2 hour wait! WHY! Everyone who has checked in after me is now leaving!

GO FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE! this place is a complete JOKE!<//text>

The staff at Hanford Imaging, was great and had much compassion for patients, especially Ari. Dr. Athale explained everything precisely that was going to be done in the procedure. They make sure that when you leave, that you are well taken care of and leave with a positive experience. I would definitely recommend them for having an AAAA++++ facility with AAAA++++ staff.<//Text>

<Text>This is my secong time there, my first time was with my m9m and we both got the same experience. The front desk girls were very nice and friendly, I arrived at 10:15 got called to the back at 10:30 and left at 10:52 they were very fast and friendly. The technition made sure he explained everything and told me what he was going to do before he did it, he kept talking to me to take my mind off my pain and he was very patient with me.</Text></record>

< review>
I had my thyroid biopsy a few weeks ago. I told the technician and the doctor twice that I have two orders of biopsy on two nodules. They didn’t bother to call my doctor to check. Apparently, they received the fax and one page of my paperwork was missing, it happened to be my second biopsy order. Now, I need to take another day off work and go though the awful procedure again to get a biopsy of my second nodule.  Their manager called me back stating that it was not their fault, it was fax machine fault.  I am afraid that they are not even looking through your papers since they did not see that one page was missing. Someone need do their job and listen to patients. I am not returning to this place.</review>

Hanford Advanced Imaging did a great job. The staff were very friendly and efficient and they offer Saturday appointments. The waiting room was very cold but otherwise my experience was very good.< /text>

<Response>None< /Response><review>The Ultrasound technician was very professional, prompt, and thorough.  Front staff was pleasant but did communicate with me that they had to wait on another part of the order from my doctor.  I waited 30 minutes and then asked myself when they told me.  I could have sat there for 2 hours without any mention to me what was happening. I was able to contact my dr and gave them verbal orders.  I still had to wait another 45 minutes to be seen.<//review>< pictures>

I had a MRI with contrast scheduled they took 40 minutes to call me then once in the treatment room already dressed in the gown the doctor was not ready had to go back to another lobby and wait another 30 minutes.   Finally during the procedure they did not have enough saline and contrast so in the middle of the procedure the assistant had to exit the room and retrieve it and the doctor had to give him step by step instructions on what to do.  It seemed they did not know what they were doing.   Afterwards I had to go back to the lobby and for another 30 minutes because again they were not ready.</text>

<Date>1474911621174</Date><Text>I was told to be here 15 minutes early for a appt at 9:45am., with a full bladder and drink 32oz. Of water.

It's 10:40am and haven't been seen yet.

I was just told the Ultrasound technician got here late and is behind.
(Not my problem) don't they understand people have jobs to get to.... and to make matters worse I feel like I'm about to pee all over this seat.

If I have to be here 15 minutes early shouldn't there own employee be held to the same accountability.

Next time I'm just going to Adventist Health pavilion.... this place is so crowded and unorganized.

I would have appreciated some heads up about the delay. Now I will be extremely late back to work..<//Text><userid>110407788767320505975<//userid><gmapID>0x8094c39b18e1011b:0x3ce7ee1ec93232d6< /gmapID>< Resp>

I was told to be here 15 minutes early for a appt at 9:45am., with a full bladder and drink 32oz. Of water.

It's 10:40am and haven't been seen yet.

I was just told the Ultrasound technician got here late and is behind.
(Not my problem) don't they understand people have jobs to get to.... and to make matters worse I feel like I'm about to pee all over this seat.

If I have to be here 15 minutes early shouldn't there own employee be held to the same accountability.

Next time I'm just going to Adventist Health pavilion.... this place is so crowded and unorganized.

I would have appreciated some heads up about the delay. Now I will be extremely late back to work..</text>

Excellent service by the technicians and front desk . Technicians made me as comfortable as can be expected for the test .
Only problem is that they schedule unrealistically- 30 minutes apart . Perhaps 45 minutes would be more realistic .</Text>

Almost all personnel were friendly and helpful. One female 'tech'  treated me as an individual, not just 'another warm body that just walked in.'

Wait time was much less than any dr's office or hospital including HCMC .

The amazing conclusion, is that this same female tech made valid suggestions that were  never brought up by any other medical personnel,  including doctors and nurses..
These  suggestions changed the course of tests I was getting and will in the future for the better..
Her caring,  knowledge, involvement, and willingness
To 'think out of the box' and to suggest modifications to the doctors orders deserves great merit.
I will conclude that the doctor changed his orders in compliance with the suggestions of this tech.<//Text>

<Review>How are you guys getting 4.5 stars? I've asked for and filled out a form in order to get my x-ray cd. I EVEN told you that i'll pick it up the NEXT DAY. When I came 24 hours later, you couldn't find it because you never made the copy. THEN, I came in another time and filled out my paperwork for a mri cd. AGAIN, I told you I'll pick it up the next day.  You lost that paperwork too and I had to fill it out again AND surprise surprise ...no cd!  You had one job to do and you can't even do it right!</Review><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1537902323477, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

< Review>
Sonographer was nice but didn't tell me what she was doing at all during my ultrasound. I would have really liked to see, but she just chattered about her son. The report they gave me wasn't legible. The writing was too small. Not really helpful.< /Review>

<Review>Appointment was @1230pm. Arrived at noon just in case any paperwork needed to be filled out. 30 minutes go by and still nothing. The staff seemed unpleasant in doing thier job. No update on the delay of waiting time. Last time I'm using this service.</Review>< Rating>

8:30 appt for ct that had already been rescheduled! It is now 10 a m still in waiting room. Techs are being trained on new ct machine. Personally they shouldn't of started making appts for ct if they don't know how to work equipment.  Very unhappy!!!</Review>

Even if you have an appointment call before you show up. Made an appointment through the appointment phone number and was scheduled for 8am last Thursday. Showed up only to be told they do not do x-rays before 9am and they were booked for the next 7 days. Showed up today for my 9am scheduled appointment: "Sorry, we are changing out the x-ray machine this morning. Can you come back this afternoon?"  Sure I can. I have nothing better to do. My boss is OK with me just coming and going as I please.  If you have the option go somewhere else.< /Text>

Well I was very disappointed with place, I was schedule for an ultrasound today 3/818 at 7a.m. I get there at 6:45am and to find out that my appt was re-schedule for 9:30 am instead, states the called me I never received the message prior to this appt I had to call them to schedule my appt cause no one called and my Dr. Fax over the paper work,  after I called and schedule the appt 3 people call me to confirm my appt, my ultrasound was for my kidneys and galballder, the people schedule my ready my request wrong they thought it was my bladder so here they have drink 32 to 48 oz of water until I get there and they take me back the girl tells me I can go to the bathroom cause I don't need my bladder full I was upset by now, I can believe all this errors by your office, I had to reschedule my appt for 3:10pm so couldn't eat til 4:30pm this just plain nonsense and I ask them how long would it take for my result to get to the Dr. They said in about an Hour so I called my Dr. At 6:30pm to see if the had my results they said no that I need to call them back  tomorrow am like your kidding me right, they said that the Imaging place is close til tomorrow so her I am since Tuesday trying to find out what's going on with me very disappointed right uuugghh< /Review>

< review>
I had a rather disappointing experience here. Sat there for 30 min longer past my appointment (pregnant lady with a full bladder for ultrasound = very uncomfortable) when I finally got back there, the tech was very rude and rushed the process. She did not let me see the screen and told me I could not take pictures (really??) and did not explain what she was doing. The pictures she gave me did not show my baby's face or position at 21 weeks. When I had to wipe the jelly off my tummy, she rushed me and told me she had other appointments so I had to put my shirt on over a wet stomach which stained my shirt. I tried conversing with her the whole time to make the experience better, but she did not want to talk, she wanted to do the job and get me out.
As a first time mom, I wanted this experience to be positive and enjoyable yet she completely ruined the experience for me. I will never come here again.< /review>

<text>I had an extremely pleasant experience at this facility.  I chose at first to go to Fresno Imaging instead of Hanford Imaging do to the reviews on this scroller.  I was not happy with the performance of Fresno Imaging either but thats another review.  Needless to say the day after my appointment with Fresno Imaging I got a call from Hanford Imaging concerned as to why I chose Fresno over Hanford and I explained my concern with the number of poor reviews.  Well to my surprise the issues I had at Fresno imaging were mostly do to poor communication and lack of attention to detail.  Hanford Imaging took care of all of those issues.  They called my insurance and provider and worked out all of the issues for me and called me back with the available appointment times for the very next day.
I went in for my imaging and realized that I had failed to fast properly and had consumed water within the previous 4 hours.   I figured I would have to reschedule for a another day/week but they rearranged their entire schedule around me and scheduled me less than 2 hours later.  Service was absolutely great.
The tech and nurse during my imaging were great.  They explained the process thoroughly as it went along and were very patient during the study's themselves.  During the contrast portion the nurse did an excellent job with a pain free injection and I was done and out less than 5 minutes.
I cannot comment on the image quality at this point but will do so after its reviewed.
I was extremely pleased with my experience and in the event that any future study's are needed I will not hesitate to return.</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x8094c39b18e1011b:0x3ce7ee1ec93232d6</gmap_id></record>

Almost 2 hours after the scheduled appointment we were finally called back. Receptionist apparently left after we were checked in therefore there was no one to answer questions or tell us what was going on. Save yourself a headache and go somewhere else.< /Review>< Resp>

It was okay. Hard to have so much liquid in and not go in right away. Then the tec said that the right procedure was not being done for what I needed or I needed something else too?  When the doctor first sent it in they had asked for a change they they received then the girl says it’s not right!  I was not feeling good about it because I needed to go to bathroom and she was trying to figure out what to do.</review>
