I see Kyle for massages. He is great. This place is out of my budget even with their packages but Kyle is worth it. Clean, everyone masked, and very relaxing.</Review>

I have been here twice. I love that they use organic friendly products. They are located in an office park and are very unassuming. It's a cute place with a good selection of services. They have a small relaxation area and no showers or locker room area so it doesnt really feel like a spa.  The massage and facial I had were both good. They have dry saunas (hence why it would be great to have a shower)  and other wellness services. They have memberships as well. The prices seem just a little high considering they are missing some of the day spa amenities. Still a good place to try if you like more natural products.
Tip: they provide robes but not slippers so if you are doing a spa package, bring your own sandals!</review>

I manage a large PT office and can easily distinguish between levels of service and I wasn't disappointed.

< Review>
Not impressed whatsoever.  My wife treated me to a spa day.  Infrared spa and foot detox was okay.  However, I was expecting a message that focused on the head neck and shoulders.  But what I got was an hour of moving my neck very slowly back and forth with some light touch of the scalp and then placement of hands under my back.  I just was expecting more manipulation of the muscles and tissue.</Review>

I absolutely loved the experience at the Eco Chateau Spa. The place has a very relaxing atmosphere and the staff is very good. I got a massage and it was the best one I ever had: perfect pressure, right atmosphere and the masseur was very professional - she spoke just enough to make me feel comfortable. Other places I've been to the ladies didn't stop talking/making questions and It was very disruptive (specially for who wants to relax). At Eco Chateau they have a warm massage table which is was perfect for winter. I also did a facial and my skin looks amazing. Over all, my experience was fantastic and certainly I'll be back. I 100% recommend it. For me it seems that spas are popping up everywhere but its hard to find a good one - I m glad I found the Eco Chateau.</text>

This place is amazing! I've tried their whole body vibrations, infrared sauna and juice cleanse. I loved all the services I've tried. Both locations are super chic and relaxing. I love the infrared sauna, my skin feels amazing and my stomach feels flatter when I do this. Infrared sauna and juice cleanse are a great kickstart to a diet/exercise program. I've referred this place to 3 friends already and they all loved it! ﻿</review>

<Rate>5</Rate><date>1511292432527<//date><review>The minute I walked into Eco Chateau I felt a warm welcome. Before even attending my appointment, I received texts for confirmation and a real person actually reached out to me to help me feel at ease about my first sauna experience. I’ve never experience this at a spa before, where an associate actually reached out to you and not an automated machine! Loved it! The front desk associate, Rachael, was extremely helpful and spoke about the services without pushing a sales pitch. You can tell she is passionate about the Spa and believes in what they do! I’ve gone in for the infrared sauna & juice (Groupon) and ended up upgrading that same night to a monthly membership. The sauna is amazing! I went in with a bad cough and a lot of build up in my throat and ears, but after that session the build up was gone and my cough started to subside - and I slept like a baby that night!

I recently went in for the Acne series facial with Nicole. She told me about the products she was going to use without pushing me to purchase and just wanted to keep me informed. She is extremely relatable and has great empathy! She was understanding of my concerns and helped me feel at ease talking about my insecurities. She was sweet and respected my desire  to remain in silence to fully relax during the session. I’ve had extractions many times before and so far, she has been the most gentle. I am excited to see where my skin goes during my next session with her. The skincare line they use felt very gentle on my skin and didn’t irritate me at all.

I’ve already told my friends about the spa and am excited to try out more services!< /review>< user_id>

I loved my first experience in here. Sara was very helpful and kind, she explained everything on how to use the infrarred sauna. I tried the juice clean for 4 days as well and it was great!
A friend and I even bought the monthly membership and today I'm going for my first heavenly massage with Jessica, can't wait!<//text>

<Text>I purchased a Groupon for a juice cleanse with sauna sessions.   The staff were friendly and eager to showcase their services.   The juice cleanse was to be used in addition to healthy eating so it was easy to incorporate to my routine and is very tasty.  I was skeptical about the infrared sauna and was surprised at how I felt after.  I don't typically like saunas or steam rooms but this was different.   It was hot and I did sweat but it wasn't too uncomfortable and I felt amazing after!  Can't wait to try their other services.</Text>< pictures>

I signed up for an 8 day cleanse, and started with a sauna. The atmosphere is so lovely,  the minute you walk through the door a sense of calm comes over you. Even at some of the fancy expensive  spas there can be this feeling of being nice, but kind of sterile.  Eco Chateu gives you a feeling of luxury,  wrapped in the comfort of a friends or grandmothers house, just relaxed.
Im extremely excited to try out a facial and get my other two sauna sessions in.</text>

Great, calming atmosphere. The team here are all super sweet and all about making your experience a great one! They make their own juices and kombucha and I have tried several flavors, all great! Recently I received a massage from Ryane and she is just amazing. Very comforting and nurturing soul. I bought a membership the first time I came because I really enjoyed my time here. I usually come for the infrared saunas which I love! They also use the MindBody app where you can schedule your sessions, find health and fitness classes near you, tips for staying healthy and much more. Get your butt down here, you won't regret it! 🤗< /review>

We couldn’t agree more on how amazing an Infrared Sauna session can be :-)  Assisting weight loss, removing toxins, relaxing muscles, improving blood circulation, and a number of other great benefits help to make just a single 40 minute session have a rather significant impact!

It works for a small town. I dont have to drive 60 (ish) miles to do smaller shopping, like laundry detergent or wash cloths.  I'm also more willing to do my grocery shopping here in our small town, since i can get almost everything we need between the  family dollar and the food mart.< /review>

They are under staffed but the staff there is helpful. Remember they need employees so that being said the store needs stocked, cleaned and straightened.< /review>

Its a overpriced 99€ store. They have cheap made shoes, ugly clothes and nothing is ever on clearence/sale cheap enough to buy. The outside is trashy and ugly. They need to invest in a gardener and some trash cans outside. However some of the workers are friendly.<//review>

< review>
Looking for a place to get water since the 3D shop we usually go to was not dispensing water and we looked up this place to see if it had water to fill.

We get here and see 2 different 'lanes' to fill up with water AND they take dollars. Convenient and closer to our work site. Double bonus.

Will probably be coming here from now on when we need to fill up with water.</review>

They don't care if it's from your personal vehicle or business, they will help you out.
They don't push a specific brand, manufacturer or quality... You get what you pay for, and they will point you in the direction you can afford.< /review>< pics>

It was a major plus that it was local too. They were able to help us get exactly what we were looking for, at a good cost. A car was even brought over from Chico to make sure we were able to test drive all the cars on our list. They were helpful and kind. They even stayed after closing to help make sure we were in a car today. Thank you for your fast and courteous help today. Were a Jeep family for sure now.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

Two months ago we bought a truck, We love our truck but not happy with the work we’ve had to do. The sales people were very pushy! The truck had zero gas in it, change oil cane on an hour after leaving the dealership, the back windows and passenger didn’t roll down or back up from driver panel, just got new tires and the breaks were completely shot!  They obviously covered up all the scratches somehow interior was filthy hair and crumbs everywhere. Check everything when you buy from here!< /review>

I purchased a car from here at super shopper auto to be honest this dealership is the best in town because the other dealerships couldn't finance me and I wasn't happy about them until I came to super shopper and they got me approved.

Fantastic. Great staff, willing to help in any way. Patient and attention to detail. Explained everything to me and followed up with updates on the process. Made sure everything was working on the car and even fixed a couple small things I found a couple of days later.</Review>

I recommend anyone reading this review to go up the road to R and R, the staff there was alot friendlier and seemed like they wanted to get me the right car for me... WHICH THEY DID!!!

I was looking for a newer car and liked the look of a dodge dart at super shopper but was immediately turned off when I was told we couldn't start the car to hear how the engine sounded until he had all of my information.

R and R on the other hand was super friendly and even told me to start the car without me even needing to ask. If anything I'm happy I went to R and R over super shoppers any day of the week!!<//review>

I bought a great car for the price and payments i wanted. How ever a few miles down the road check engine light came on. They charged us to fix the problem and again it came back on. Took it back and they just reset the light. So again its back on. My ac dont work. Engine lights on. This car sucks. They said they would fix it for cheap. I just bought this car it shouldn't have this many problems already.<//Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Review>Scammers!!! Sold us a broken car KNEW it was broken. It was also a trade in that they never cleared up with DMV so it took 7 months to get the paperwork. Finally we went in and threatened them with a lawsuit they refused the 30 day warranty they provided to fix any issues. All the coil packs blew the flywheel was toast the starter was broken the transmission was giving out. We lost $1600 never got a dime back. We had to eventually donate the car as parts to get county off our butt. Most dishonest dealership EVER.</Review><userid>103313552233673802715<//userid></record>

Rod, You guys are making things so much easier for us. You sold our Jeep and now you must pay us what we are owed, we have been saying you sold us the Jeep and it wasn't smog legal, you said I was wrong, you even told the BBB I was wrong and now low and behold you again sell it before you smog and it won't pass smog just as I said. We took pics to the smog shop and it has the same problem now that it did then. All your lies are coming out, you lied to us and you lied to the BBB. It truly is no wonder your company has the worst reputation around, even the law enforcement would like to see you out of business.<//Text>

< Review>
Super shopper made it possible for me to purchase a 2008 Chrysler SUV.  My credit was low and required a high down payment.  They bend over backwards to make it work with the bank. They held the car for me and gave me time to gather my documents and down payment.  If they have a customer in the office, they will stay until 5pm, 6pm, 7pm, 8pm, 9pm.  If you have marginal credit, and think it is impossible to buy a vehicle, but you have a monthly income, I would highly recommend them!  Tell them that Will sent you!<//Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) Last weekend my sister and my brother-in-law went to see the cars because my brother-in-law needed an extra one for the work, total they saw one they liked and they did all the paperwork and they told them that if they qualified, today they call my sister that they needed to put another person to qualify, my sister told them that because they told him that if they qualified and according to them they do not get out there if they qualify or not, really? Everywhere they tell you whether or not from the beginning, or the seller wanted his mission. The dealer does not know what he is doing. Apart from the fact that the control of the car did not work, two days later the light of the check engine turned on. Terrible service.

El fin de semana pasado mi hermana y mi cuñado fueron a ver los carros porque mi cuñado necesitaba uno extra para el trabajo, total que vieron uno que les gusto y hicieron todo el papeleo y les dijeron que si calificaron, hoy le llaman a mi hermana que necesitaban poner a otra persona para que calificaran, mi hermana les dijo que porque le dijeron entokces que si calificaron y segun ellos no les sale ahi si califican ol no, en serio? En todos lados te dicen si o no desde un principio, o el.vendedor sllo queria su c ol mision l el concesionario no sabe lo que hace. Aparte de que el control del carro no funcionaba, a los dos dias le prendio la luz del check engine. Pesimo servicio.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x8082e4b56072ed07:0xb38428f4df728571</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Everyone was completely friendly and professional! I highly recommend this place to anybody that needs their service! And the receptionist was friendly, informative, and quick to serve me. She answered all my questions and made me feel completely comfortable. They use state of the art equipment and technology to take care of all your needs, so any procedure that is done has a quick and positive recovery time. I've taken other people there also and they've had the same positive experience, I would recommend this place to anybody!< /review>

The staff has be kind and helpful. I am impressed with the responsiveness I get from this office. It is far better than anywhere else I have been for medical treatment. I do not remember everyones names that has helped me so far but two that stick out are Sylvia and Brenda. Sylvia is on top of it as my surgery scheduler and Brenda is great at the front. I have not had my Surgery yet but Dr. Fuji seems like he will take care of me. I do not have any worries at this point in time.< /text>

I had a great experience with Dr. Fujii and his staff. They are very accommodating and friendly. Dr. Fujii is very thorough with his explanation of my diagnosis and treatment plan. The surgery also went really well and I am almost back on my feet after just a few weeks from surgery. The staffs, Brenda and Sylvia are also very friendly and courteous. They are also very helpful and organized.</review>

Dr. Fujii reviewed all issues following hip arthroplasty surgery on 3/2/21 at my three months follow up checkup.  It will take some time to regain pre-surgery functionality but I'm doing really well on my recovery as long as I don’t overdo it.  Physical therapy, walking and resting are key to a good recovery.  Scott and his staff are very helpful and takes as much time as we need to understand my fully functioning hip without pain.  I have prior back and Bursa problems that are affecting my recovery as well but we came up with a plan to work through the issues.  Thank you so much for all your help!<//Review>

This is a very friendly and professional team. My appointments are always on time. I feel heard, appreciated and respected by all. They have two very convenient locations, Sacramento and Roseville. I have been to both offices. Roseville office is a much easier parking situation, due to the Sacramento office is near Mercy San Juan hospital, and parking there is very limited most of the time.<//review>

<Review>I was first greeted by Brenda and felt very welcomed to their office. After a few moments I was seen by Dr. Fujii and it was nice to be heard and understood. He was able to explain to me not only what was going on with my shoulder but then gave me clear breakdown of what the steps towards surgery and recovery looked like. I had my surgery 10/16 and have been make great strides to full mobility of my shoulder.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I was so pleased when he gave me a solid treatment plan to rehabilitate my achy ankle! Then, on my second visit, since I had some other issues arise in the foot but unrelated to the ankle, he sensed my anxiety regarding the surgery on the ankle. I was thrilled that he was able to offer an alternate approach to the process of recovery. I really feel like I am being heard at Premier Podiatry and Orthopedics by the whole staff. I am so happy to have reliable and knowledgeable people in my corner now. I always walk out of the office feeling reassured and hopeful.</Review>< pics>

Once again Doctor Fujii and his fine staff have hit another home run.  Total knee replacement surgery at 7:30 am and home by 3 pm. Doing great at two weeks out.  Special shout out for Sylvia who continues to step up and make the process work!<//Text>

I was especially impressed with Dr. Betesh when he correctly identified the two kinds of running shoes I brought to the appointment.  He is certainly well versed in his craft and I recommend him.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>I personally see Dr. Betesh and I can say he’s an outstanding doctor. He listens to what’s going on and gives you multiple solutions. Myself personally needed custom orthotics but if insurance doesn’t cover them he knows it’s pricey and doesn’t push it on you, he gave me alternative options. The front desk ladies at the Roseville office are very nice as well!<//Review>< Pics>

Complete knee replacement ; in out & on my way to a new life without limping anymore still sore as hell but the smoothness of the new joint is incredible Dr Fujii was professional the whole time and in my opinion did a Superior Operation & thanks to all the other people at Dignity & premier podiatry for their kindness warmth & reassuring manner in which I was treated I would reccomend them all with the highest regard possible!

<review>I have Had nothing but the best care and the dealt with the nicest people in the Roseville office.  Brenda at the front of the office in Roseville is such a cheerful and nice person.  I also love dealing with Katie she is so sweet, wonderful and caring every time I have to go into the office.  Most of all Dr. Betesh is Wonderful!!   He looks VERY young but I feel like he has been practicing forever, so don’t let his young looks fool you he is the BEST I’ve ever known when it comes to my injury.  If you can have a surgeon/podiatrist I would recommend you try and get with Dr. Betesh!  I can’t say enough about the experience I have had with Premier Podiatry.  Thank you to all the staff for making me feel comfortable and at ease while dealing with my ankle issues!<//review>< pictures>

After putting the mini spare on, we called Joe’s Tires, spoke to the nicest guy named, Adrian, and made it to town. Adrian and Oscar took just a few minutes to put on a fresh tire and on our way we went. Best service. Adrian was exceptional with knowledge and costs.

Went there the gentleman was very polite and honest. Cone to find out no leaks  or holes. He air up the tires and barely charge me. Awesome place and honest employers<//Review>< rate>

I do not recommend Joe's to anyone. They took my money and did no work. I had this confirmed by another shop in the area. Be prepared to be ripped off if you use Joe's in the future. I will not be back for work on my vehicle ever in the future...<//text>

<Text>Joe's Tires was super friendly and helpful with replacing two of my tires. Fast service, great pricing. I called 20 minutes before closing and asked for a quote and if they had time before they closed and they said yea come on down. They even stayed 10 minutes after to help me and did'nt seem to mind. $45 each. Very pleased. Highly recommended.Thanks guys!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80d1393ad42c6d63:0xcf9e49f81ef6e174<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Awesome!   We were traveling through and our tire blew without having a very good flat.   We called them when we were 10 minutes away and they closed in 5.   When we pulled up, they were still open and waiting for us with our tire ready.   Did not seem upset or distraught at having to stay an extra few minutes; seemed more happy to help.   Checked all the tire pressures (including the spare), gave us a great used tire that looked almost new and we left with them - and us - smiling.    Great people.<//text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x80d1393ad42c6d63:0xcf9e49f81ef6e174< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

At first he was nice didnt have the right size for our mini van but had some that would work. We had driven about 5 hrs from out of town ended up with flat had to go eat with my two little ones one (being autistic she can be difficult when frustrated)ate then called Joe's totell them we were on the way back he said they were closed I said this web site says they are open till six it was a bit after five. He said no they close earlier on weekends.. i said its friday.. he said well its the end of the week...and well sorry  you were here earlier.. ( basically  We should have stayed ) and he  would have to take care of us tomorrow... I was like I'm sorry I thought u were open per ur web site<//review>

How do you call someone who's getting tires changed on a 3 year old 1.6 liter car to tell them they need injector service but don't call to tell me that my tires aren't really in stock and we are going to go get them at another store thus wasting an extra hour of my time? Probably because they know I would have taken the car elsewhere had they told me they weren't in stock time is money and yall wasted my time today< /Text>

< Review>
I purchased a set of tires for my Prius on Dec. 6.  Bud's had done well for me on previous occasions, but not this time.   The staff was still friendly, but service was lacking.
First, I was told that there was a $50 mail-in rebate on the tires I purchased.  When I got home and looked for the rebate, it had expired 5 months before.
Second, I noticed that my average gas mileage had dropped by 10% for 3 tanks of gas.  I thought it may have been the tires.  But on a routine maintenance check, the tire air pressure was about 22 psi. The door frame placard clearly says 32 psi. This is something the staff should have known about and done correctly.
I'm now questioning whether I'll be back or not.
I was going to e-mail them directly and give them a chance to address this, but there's no e-mail listed on their website.</Review>

Fantastic service, reasonable prices and the staff are a joy to deal with at Bud's. Came here for the first time for new tires and some other service. The staff ended up recommending reasonably priced tired, nixed the brakes I though I needed and got me a nice deal on an alignment

Service was quick my car was ready in about three hours. Will definitely be coming back< /text>

<GmapID>0x80dca51a30884713:0x30ed281b2dc32186</GmapID><Review>I brought my car here yesterday, i was supposed to get an AC inspection with them bec. The other Buds @ MoVal says my car requires a different freon than the regular one, and this location has it. But they ran a problem with my car, they said the AC machine detected contamination and went to safe mode, so they couldnt fix it, and had to take it to the honda dealership instead, they took about 3 hrs. To check it out, i have no problem with that, but they were nice enough to give me a lyft ride home while i wait. The Buds @ MoVal doesnt even do that!! Its either you stay, leave with a friend's car, or take an uber/lyft ride home. Rides going home doesnt come cheap.

Jesse was the one who helped me out, in fact all the front guys and staff were very friendly and professional with their job, i like the fact that they took a look at my car right away, as soon as i checked in at my appointment. The other Buds @ MoVal, even though you had an appointment with them, like right when they open, theres other cars came before me already parked in their garage!

Anyway, even though they didnt get my car fixed, i think i actually prefer going to this location instead, the location is a bit bigger and i been a loyal Bud's customer for years!

One question to the owerns: if i made a lifetime alignment warranty with Buds @ MoVal, can i use it in this location too? Cuz i think you can look up my records with my phone number.<//Review><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

<text>My Dodge Charger needed new tires, an alignment, and a oil change. I have gone to Buds for the last couple years for a variety of car repairs and they have never let me down. I called a few stores to price tires and no one could beat Buds. Buds manager Rich was very helpful on the phone and offered advise on tire selection. He didn’t try and force me into the most expensive tire. He got me the best bang for my buck. I was able to make an appointment that worked for me with easy. My car was ready fast than I thought it would be. They were able to work with my budget and saved me a huge amount of money. I recommend Buds Tires to anyone with any car needs.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>{'time': 1530027540010, 'text': 'Thank you James for taking the time to share your experience with Rich!

<text>I have been to this location twice, but my review is for the most recent. Took in a vehicle for install of tires that were purchased from an online vendor that uses Bud's as an authorized installer. Bud's had the tires installed in a couple hours without issue. I even checked the lug nuts for over torquing and everything was good. Over torqued lug nuts is a pet peeve of mine and I appreciate it when shops take the time to properly torque the lug nuts back on and not rush with the impact wrench.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
Excellent engine service! I brought my car in after the engine light came on, they replaced the coil packs. Problem solved,
Thank you Jessy and your professional team of very experienced mechanics.
Great job!  Especially after Walters Mercedes whom serviced it for 10 years, knew coil packs needed replaced, recommended a new engine or rebuild it.
Buds Tires saved me over  $10,000.00.
Great mechanics, they do more than tires.</Review>

<Text>I want to start by saying this place has good customer service from my experience with Mike.  The definition Bud's Tire has for a "appointment" is completely wrong. I had a 9am appointment and arrived at 8:45am; 9:43 they pulled my car from the lot to be put on the rack and inspected. Do not come here during the week if you live a busy schedule. I do not like to give poor reviews but the time management of this location needed to be addressed. A company should not over book and allow appointments to be made that they cannot fulfill.< /Text>< pictures>

I spent three hours at Bud's just for a set of tires. I felt like there was a total lack of communication between everybody there.  I arrived in the morning and the tires for my truck had to be ordered.  I was told to return between 2:30 and 3:00 and I would be out by 5:00. I returned at 2:50 and was told my tires hadn't arrived yet.  At 3:30 I asked if they had arrived and was told no.  By the way there was another customer with the same issue.  At 3:45 I asked again and surprisingly they had arrived... and no one knew it...My truck was taken into the shop around 4:45 and it was done around 5:30..The people are very nice, but don't have any pressing issue about sticking to what they said.< /review>

I love this place! My husband & I have purchased 3 sets of tires from Bud's over the last 3 years or so and they have always been great. I am usually the one to go in and the service is awesome, prices are fair, the guys are always polite and helpful. I will continue to get tires & basic service at Bud's.

I Started buying my tires from Bud's Tire and Wheel for my company trucks, which includes free flat repair. But each time we have a flat, and bring the truck into them it's definitely not a priority to take care of you. Last time my guys had to wait two hours to get a simple flat fixed. I was just told it will take an hour before they can get to my truck to fix a screw hole in the tire.<//review>

This is our new go-to place for tires and service. While they are not the cheapest place in town, they provide great service and value -- which in my mind is more important. Bud's locations are also regularly recognized as local Riverside favorites. They deserve the reputation. And Bud personally responds to email, and is involved in the community. Good job guys!< /text>

I've been to 3 different Bud's locations and always receive top notch service. Got a great deal on my last set of tires at the Wood street location.  I love that they're local, they support the community and the owner actively runs the business.< /Review>

< review>
I went in to have my tires rotated and brakes and rotors checked. The tire rotatation came out fine but when it came to the brakes I was told that I had hot spots on my rotors. I knew about the hot spots and asked if they could machine them down, was told no, and that it would cost about $400 to complete. I didn't get it done because I was skeptical.

I took my truck to the dealership, talked with them about my rotors, and was told that it could be done. It ended up costing $200 instead of 4. Needless to say, I'll be sticking with my dealer.

TL;DR: Would only go back for basic fixes/repairs, nothing more.</review>

I highly recommend this place. They are very knowledgeable and they go beyond and above to take care of whatever the issues you have with your vehicle. For instance, my Ford F350 dually truck was pulling to the right. I had brought it to the local Ford dealer twice and had no luck correcting the problem. However, Jesse personally involved with my issue and with help from their very knowledgeable alignment technician,(Manny) they were able to pinpoint the problem and took care of it; no more pulling and the truck drives very smoothly. In addition, I had annoying steering vibration with my 2015 Jetta TDI which I had taken it to other known chain alignment/tire shops--will not name them--none of them was able to solve it. However, Bud's Tire and Wheel (Jesse) listened to my concerns and they were able to correct the problem and my car now has zero vibration and drives as smoothly as possible. In my opinion, they're able to solve unique tire balance, alignment issues because they have the latest most technologically advanced equipments, highly trained technicians along with service advisors who are there to take care of your problems.<//Text>

<Review>Customer service was excellent, the place was spotless, and the services performed were fast. All I had to do was get an oil change and have them reattach my splash guard, but the overall experience was a good one.<//Review>< pics>

HORRIBLE timing and scheduling. I made an appmt in person for the next day. It was 4:15 when I made the appmt and asked for the same time because I went there straight from work. He made the appmt for 4pm. I reminded him I just got there from work and asked for a grace period. He replied "no problem." At 4:15 I was told I had to reschedule because they already put 2 cars in my spot. Nice…I will NOT be going back.</Text>

We were trying to order the tire for Monday, but you didn't give us a chance to make the arrangements.  I would like to talk to you as soon as possible, please call me at (951) 530-4260.

This place is a joke....we have taken our cars there for brakes, tire, 3 different cars, and 2 of the 3 cars were return with issues that were not the original issue I took it in for.

My car had grease all over my interior, they did apologize; however after the other issues, its too late.

I will never come back to Buds Tire even if they gave me a FREE OIL CHANGE.....

Very Unhappy Customer!!!!<//Text>

<Text>Popped into this French bakery for a quick bite.  Excellent!!! Had coffee and their Lorraine Quiche and coffee. Sorry no pic of food, too hungry.   Parking is tight until rr track construction finished.   I parked up a side street 1 block North.

Food was yummy and great service. Has outdoor seating and seems to be a popular spot for the cyclists passing through. Had the crepes and sandwiches. Would definitely go back to try the pastries and other desserts.</Text>

Second time stopping by this little French cafe, with proper croissants and excellent food both times. This time I was on my way down 101 coast hwy, and remembered to stop in for breakfast. They had my fav. tea, earl grey tea too. So points for that.
Stop in, you won’t be disappointed and probably leave thinking about your next visit.<//review>

<Text>Cute and great French little bistro with only outside dining. My omelet du soleil was delicious and more than enough for a good price. Parking can be difficult except on weekends.  You can use the post office parking. Their double espresso was superb smooth and strong just like in France.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80dc0ce57455b813:0x9bd087b92c93d4c0</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<UserId.>118146142741420564479<//UserId.><review>Cute little restaurant on the coast highway. Awesome choice for a late morning meal or lunch. Lots of espressos to choose from, as well as sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. We shared the Nutella and banana crepe, and a hot chocolate. The crepe was amazing. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Some are French speaking, so I guess we can deduce the selections are authentic.<//review>< rating>

<Review>It's actually quite surprising how good this small little place was! My family and I were quite surprised because it was super good! Really awesome cute neat little spot in town to get a quick bite of crepes! Their sandwiches are also really good so if you're in town make sure to stop in for a nice fresh little snack!</Review>< pics>

<Text>Love the location and beautiful set up. Planned on making this my morning routine for the next 7 days. Food is exceptional. Wonderful. Espresso w cream lovely. Had planned on coming daily while on vacation. However, cashier ( Parisian older woman with glasses and short hair) was exceptionally RUDE. Tried clarifying their breakfast options only to have her give me the most unfriendly responses. As if I was a fly that had no business there. What a shame. If I can find another place similar but with friendlier staff...i won't be returning.< /Text>< pics>

It's quite loudly "French", with its Eiffel towers and la vie en rose playing from a speaker. That's a good thing though, because this place does feel like a you're taking a pause in Paris. Fresh baguettes, perfectly poised desserts, and dozens of omelette and sandwich combinations. Lovely!< /Review>

I had the creamiest, "Melt in your Mouth" Cremini mushroom, Turkey, & aged cheddar cheese Friratta, which came with a side salad. Also a Chai Latte with almond milk, which the owner made a little cooler without adding ice. Everything was prepared to Perfection. Staff were all very friendly & helpful. Lastly I had the Creme Brulee 💋👌The owner is very sweet & shared w me the salad greens are organically grown locally by Veterans! They have an abunce of Gluten Free, & Dairy free options. Check them out. Bona Petit 🤗< /Review>

I definitely recommend this place! They have gluten free and vegan choices. Their crepes and sandwiches are absolutely phenomenal! Their coffee is fantastic. It’s a bit on the smaller side and definitely needs more seating but their staff is friendly, and helpful. I will absolutely come back here whenever I’m in town!<//Text>

Great sandwiches, coffee, and sweets! Reminded us of the little bakeries we're visited in France. There is a little wait for the made to order food, but that's understandable due to kitchen size. Great little spot near the beach!< /Review>

My family and I make it a point to visit this little bakery whenever we come to southern California. It is a quite little spot with excellent food and good customer service. Highly recommend!< /review>

I am addicted to the French Corner!  Not only is the food so yummy and unique, it has also become my favorite place to stop for an amazing latte and read one of my books. It's charming with its jazzy French music playing all the time. Everyone in the cafe is so friendly and personal too. Your treated like your special when you are there. The owner is especially fun to talk to. She is very passionate about her life in Paris and is exceptionally passionate about fresh organic ingredients in her menu and recipes. Her attention to detail shows. I wish I could recommend one special dish but because I love everything so much, go ahead and just pick one...you won't be sorry. I've noticed now that I'm a regular that she has lots of other fans like myself. I'm starting to feel like I'm really in a Paris Cafe!
BTW - It's very dog-friendly so bring your pup to join you!</Review>

Until 2018 Saturday October 20, I was uninitiated to lunch and desserts at the French Corner, Leucadia, California.  My friend treated me to lunch.  I ordered the four cheese melted yummy baguette sandwich and delicious organic walnut cranberry salad!  Hearty and healthy!  We arrived with plenty of tables from which to choose.  Be prepared to park and walk.  It's worth to park a block or two away since street space is competitive.

Enjoy your meal and scrumptious dessert!  They have gluten free pies so your taste buds will be grateful if you are gluten in tolerate!  God bless and have a great time at this truly sweet gem on Highway 101!</review>

< Review>
Went for lunch with a friend on June 28th, the line was out the door when we first got there. It's really awkward, because people are coming out of the doorway after they order and the people waiting to order are also using the same tight doorway. Not a good impression. Excuse me, oh, excuse me, oh pardon me. Not a good start.
The young man taking the orders was obviously really really new, no greeting, no personality, no voice, maybe he was scared? Strange to say the least.
We ate in the back, there is a nice patio that is hidden, west of where you order. Nice and quiet and perfect for conversation.
I ordered the daily special, think it was chicken salad in a sandwich, my friend ordered a ham sandwich. They were good. I think we missed out on the real specialities - we saw the most delicious coffee's getting served and bakery items that make your mouth water.  I will go back, give them another chance and try the bakery items.
3 stars for service and awkward ordering process</Review>

<Text>This is the tastiest breakfast spot in the area. They have a great variety of quiche, crepes, omelets and other breakfast fare. The ambiance is great too...be aware, it's counter service and tables can be hard to come by for larger parties during peak times.</Text>< pics>

The French Corner is amazing. I love sitting out on the corner and watch the traffic go by.
The coffee is delicious, the crepes, omelets and everything else is so good! One of my favorite spots here.< /text>

<Text>Delicious food and unique cafe drinks. My favorite is the breakfast egg sanwhich on their homemade baguettes. Simple ingredients but such crazy flavor. Takes a while for food to be prepared but most definitely worth the wait. Nice out door patio seating.<//Text>< pics>

A very pleasant surprise when we stopped in today.  World class pastry in a very modest shop. Fresh apricot turnovers, apple pastry and coffee...French Roast, naturally.

It is worth making a special stop at the Leukadia exit on I-5 north of the Del Mar Race track...turn west, then a couple bocks North on highway 1, next to the Post Office.</Review>

LOOKS CUTE ! My wife and I spotted this new cafe for the first time last Sunday so we decided to try it out. We locked up our bikes and made our way inside the cafe to place an order. It's got to be the smallest cafe we've ever been in without a doubt. All the tables and chairs are on a narrow terrace outside of the cafe which is on the ground floor of a recently built row home fronting the 101. We ordered a Cappuccino, an Iced Latte and a Caprese Sandwich on a Baguette. For such a tiny place there was quite a large amount of quality looking pastries and quiches on display...even a rest room just inside the entrance. We found a table and a couple of chairs down the back of the narrow terrace and soon after our lunch order arrived. My wife's Cappuccino was quite good as was my Iced Latte. We shared the Caprese Sandwich and it was fine. Overall we thought our food and drinks were reasonable value, the service was fast enough and friendly but the location is cramped to say the least and horribly noisy. It's a strange claustrophobic space for a cafe even though the owner obviously knows her stuff.<//Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><rating>1<//rating><Review>First off, the owner of the place is horrendously rude to her customers and staff. I went in and tried to order one of her sandwiches and was explaining what I want and don't want on the sandwich and she then took an attitude with me because I was holding up the line; the line consisting of two people behind me. Then after I order I wait outside for what seemed like half an hour before the food is delivered and to my surprise the bread was stale and some of the greens on my sandwich were browning. Second, the prices are ridiculous for food that isn't that great, I can go to the French bakery up by Ralph's for cheaper and have good food instead of being robbed for mediocre food at best. Third, the restaurant doesn't have a dish washer, that's correct, NO dishwasher. All the dishes are hand washed and then dried, to me that is disgusting and the plates could very well still have contaniments from sitting in a basin with other dirty dishes. Finally I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone, save your money and go elsewhere where you are treated kindly by management while being served better quality food.</Review>< username>

I finally had a chance to go check out this place. A friend invited me to go to lunch there. They seemed a bit overwhelmed with with small amount of customers they had. The food was brought to our table within  a reasonable time and was very good. Today I took another friend there. There were less people this time and we ordered pretty quickly.We went outside to wait for our food, and wait , and wait.....about  45 minutes later they came out calling my name and set down the wrong food. I didn't care as I was starving and started. My friend being a vegetarian had to send his back. Don't think I'll go back.I only gave 1 star because it wouldn't let me check none<//Review>

Great small bakery/cafe!  I've been coming here for over a year now and I'm addicted to the cafe miel and la citron crepe (amazing combo) among many other goodies available here.  This cafe is truly authentic, operated by a Parisan, it hosts a wide range of French food and drinks.  From quiches, crepes, macaroons, pastries, baguette sandwiches, specialty cakes, crossiants, omelettes you'll find a huge delicious variety in this small corner.  Relax outside and become immersed in the French music.  Highly recommend!</Review>

< Review>
The food might be good but the worst customer service I've ever seen. Owner is very rude and hardly acknowledges customers. After messing up my order she made me repay for a different order and brought it out 45 minutes later. As I was trying to speak to them, all of them had their backs turned to me. It was pretty ridiculous. They also don't post any allergen statements. When I asked if their food had nuts in it one said yes and the other said no, and that it sometimes does and doesn't.</Review>

I went to this cute spot for the first time!! I enjoyed a few items that I realized I can't find at nearby French bakeries. But the items I loved the most were the pastries!

Heads up though, I found out from an old employee here that the pastries come straight from Carlsbad French Bakery (I wish they would give the Carlsabd French Bakery their proper credit). Funny enough, I have been going to that bakery for years! I'm glad I can get my favorite pastries from Carlsbad in Encinras now too! The only reason I give three stars is because it's cheaper to get the pastries from the bakery where they are made from scratch in Carlsbad, and a little too over priced for me here at French Corner.</Review>

< review>
Fun park for the kiddos if they ever get tired of goingto the "Train Park" as my kiddo calls it. It has slides and structures for play of all ages. The structures do show their age, but they appear cared for. Also includes a basketball goal. The only drawback to this park is that there are no bathrooms.< /review>

Great park! Baby swings, slides, basketball court, grass area and picnic tables.
Pros: partly shaded and rarely crowded Cons: wood chips<//Review>

There's a large structure in the center of the park, but is completely locked up - what appears to be a park office or perhaps bathrooms - is NOT. Unless you live locally, there ARE NO BATHROOMS here, so beware! We stopped here on the way back from a camping trip in the hopes to have lunch and relax with kids.<//text><Response>None<//Response><username>Shaya Klechevsky< /username><Time>1505153572776< /Time>< userid>

<review>Popular store that is pretty old etc. They have pretty unique collection of items in the store. They have cafe and sell sandwiches, pizza and boxed lunches. A bit expensive but food was delicious!
Conveniently located on Hwy29. So if you are in town for wine tasting or other tourist stuff-you want to check this place out!</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN0HrLo3CNrMIsUjluD3pQ-4rzSR_Y_iK-oQ539=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNaf7p9_3XeYT083nj1Onrc87CMTqm6gTBw6ToL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNGcdy4HToDAG4VBuY70gz2OBzWM30-Ug60vLJV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUrHeGhX5NF8IL48FLqgebID4tsawnHM3bJv5S=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3mX4kOWFJFOGN9VhLo4t-GIfkQ1IN1pRdZmEm=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP76KiyZ6a_WHCJUU4tt1ELdA-rRPkMQpO0A29E=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNG5PG-d637w5bwuDURuVIE_0lZowxBMfYGj5p3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjcKIfL8W3B54mW-_WmanlgH_NSknL34ptkqPt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMRSkVyX_296EPuQALhtRzaZdquAEXNIcHzHcLL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlpeeQFPUquoL1WvsgPVLuWznrKZqyVsV0GnU6=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBjqarW1igyQnrPfJjrFcU6EjqTeet-ns7BsGC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMbeuCxeMWKh_mQHSaNvcCdPUVkMoHVJ9w26jYZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x8084544b41c336fd:0x47087a7305951bc9< /gmap_id></record>

Favorite stop to get the perfect lunch! They have amazing food prepared daily and their wine selection is grand! The fire oven pizza with peaches is my favorite and I love how much seating they have available. They also have the best souvenir/gifts for anyone to take home or make into a present.< /Text>

<Review>We come  here whenever we are in the neighborhood.  Great deli. My wife loves the chorizo from various locations around the world.  Good place to grab a sandwich and sit in the terrace area. We are regular customers.<//Review>< userid>

<review>Always a great deli, but now has pizza and smoked bbq, plus a great tasting room word by the glass options.  Avoid heavy lunch time crowd, and consider the picnic tables overlooking Opus One (but don't waste your time at Opus.)</review>< Gmap_id>

A classic Napa Valley experience. The unique selection of gourmet foods, meats and cheeses is always worth the trip along with a very good assortment of hard to find wines.

Worth the stop when you are between tastings.<//Review>

Adorable country style atmosphere. Tons of unique Napa offerings for yourself or for gift giving. They offer several taste samples of local items. Be prepared to buy everything you try. The staff are very friendly and helpful. There's a cool glass covered hole in the ground that will make you look twice before walking across. My girls loved it<//review>

We were there with our friend and not only we got good wine and food but also we got a nice treat from the owner. He had a nice conversation with us and he opened a nice France wine for us as a gift which completed our beautiful day over there. Pizza was the best pizza I have ever ate. You must try this place. Also wine tasting setup is perfect you can get a large selection of best wines in a nice open seating area. Walter who is the manager is a nice knowledgeable guy.< /Review>

Great selection of cheeses and deli meats, candies, chocolates, coffees and teas. A bit pricey, but I was treating myself. I ordered a breakfast sandwhich on a croissant instead of the rosemary chibata bread and it was very plain. No seasoning of any kind. Nice for gifts and a special treat.</text>

Really busy place on a Sunday afternoon. They have excellent social distancing practices. We had sandwiches - chicken salad and tuna - on incredibly tasty bread with excellent texture and remarkable crust. They have extensive wine selections; not a big surprise given the location.  Some good deals on local labels. The cheese section features both local and area cheeses.  Of note, they sell Toma cheese. Maybe not a big deal locally but a hard found delicacy where I live in the Midwest. The place is crammed with delicacies and stuff; too much to look at or sample in one visit. Give yourself time for more than one visit.< /review>

SO Good!!!!! The Chicken Gruyere sandwich is delicious!!!

Great outdoor seating!
They are VERY good about sanitizing tables in between customers at the seated tables outside!!!

They carry a lot of local artisan products like jams, cookies, wines!

Great little place to pick up everything wine including cheese, charcuterie,  crackers, stone fire grilled pizza, etc ...  I have to give 4 stars because they needed one element MUSIC. I mean just a radio would have provided the last element to make this simple afternoon amazing,  so bring your own music and you're on to 5 star event<//Text>

Next to the Oakville Grocery is the 1881 NAPA museum.  Current ownership is the same family as Buena Vista vineyards in Sonoma.

They offer wine tastings from the 1881 estates.  Very friendly reception and the displays we’re phenomenal.< /text>

So much more than a grocery store. Excellent food and nice outdoor seating. Don't forget they also have a separate pizza oven outside, that makes delicious mac and cheese too.</Review>

I had visited here before the new owners, and wasn't impressed.. now it's my favorite place to eat, drink and shop in Napa Valley. A complete turnaround as far as what they serve and sell. When we stopped for lunch in July they had a charred corn pizza on the menu that sounded so strange we had to try it. Now we can't stop thinking about it and craving it! Stopped in again this week and we thought it was perfect last time, but they have continued to offer even better experiences. Don't overlook the wine tastings in the back - they are some of the best in Napa Valley. Enjoy the opportunity to taste small volume offerings that you can't find anywhere else by the splash, half or full glass serving.

An excellent cheese selection, and the salads and sandwiches that you can enjoy there or take with are delicious! If you are touring Napa Valley, make this your go to destination.</Text>

One of the Napa Valley's bucket list places. Gourmet sandwiches and deli items. Wood-fired pizza. Plenty of picnic tables. You can also visit the "1881" winery on the property and enjoy their wines with your food.</Review>

<review>We stopped here to pick up a picnic lunch. What a variety! Excellent sandwiches, salads, cheeses, wines. You could easily spend more time trying to select your lunch than having your lunch! It's a terrific stop along the way to at least five amazing wineries. Mondavi, Opus One, Cakebread, Silver Oak are literally next door.< /review><Response>None< /Response></record>

The coffee is decent and the service is nice. But I got a expensive muffin that's so underbaked I wonder if they know the difference between muffins and batter.</review>

The Oakville Grocery store was an awesome little place to stop in for all kinds of wines, and snacks that would make for an incredible afternoon picnic. The staff is great and willing to help you find what you need, and the attention to detail and various snacks are great.< /review>

<Review>Great little store and lunch venue in Napa Valley. I visited on Saturday March 7, 2020. My lunch was good as I had a salmon sandwich.  Service was a bit slow but, the store was crowded.

A usual stop traveling through the valley. It was recommend back in 1990 and I have never been disappointed. While waiting for your delicious sandwich to be freshly prepared, you can walk around and shop the shelves. They are full of different tasty condiments which are perfect for home or as a gift.< /text>

When ever I'm going up The Napa Valley for play, I always stop here. Located just up Hwy 29. I always look forward to a fabulous gourmet lunch (Deli style). Great selection of world class cheeses and sophisticated wines. From home chefs to professionals - STOP HERE!!!!< /Review>

Always great food served with big smiles! In all of its iterations, one thing has remained constant: the service! And of course, the food is always wonderful with enough unique variations to keep it interesting. Iconic Napa location for a quick lunch in between Winery tastings. Perfect.</Text>

Really great selection of wine, cheese, and deli meats. The museum is small, but has plenty of antique tools on display. Would highly recommend stopping in during your wine county touring.</text>

Amongst all the wine they also have hard cider by La Captive. And great espresso drinks.< /Review>

Oakville Grocery was delicious. As visitors, it was the perfect spot to grab lunch during tastings. Sandwiches were made fresh and absolutely great. Staff was friendly and their selections of fresh made baked goods, drinks, deli-style sides and artisanal groceries was impressive.  I recommend grabbing a seat on the large patio out back. Definitely worth a stop.<//text>

Crowded and busy place but they handle crowds efficiently.  Very good deli and souvenirs and bakery. Excellent place to grab a sandwich for a picnic. Friendly staff. Nice courtyard. Good parking. Bought some olive oil and vinegars. Easy access off highway

Great place for a deli lunch.  Better to go on a weekday because on weekends this small market is crowded!  Sandwiches are very good.  Reasonably priced. They have a nice patio with picnic tables/umbrellas.<//Review>

<text>On our 1st night in Calistoga it was unbearably hot. (102°),  double what we'd left in Ohio. Then the power went out in the whole town. We walked to the grocery, and they did their best to accommodate shoppers with minimum power from their generator. They were friendly and positive, not letting the inconvenience bring on a bad attitude.< /text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_id>

<review>Love this small store for gourmet food and drinks. We mainly use it to make a picnic when we head up towards St. Helena.

Only issue is its getting more crowded every time we go up there, which is great for business, but honestly you need a whole hour built in on Saturday's now!< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<username>Andrew Ollero</username><review>Great place to stop for a sandwich, coffee, or pizza. Also has great cheeses and meats to create a picnic basket. Lots of fun wine accessories and tasting stuff. They have outdoor seating and parking around the building. Be mindful pulling into the driveway from the highway. It can be a quick turn. It gets pretty packed in there during the lunch hour. Also, you're in wine country so be prepared for the prices. It can get spendy in there.</review><UserId.>105355990632397886455< /UserId.>< Rating>

Rather than burning daylight at a sit down lunch, you can spend as much or as little time here. Great sandwiches, lunch options and sides, snacks, drinks and even a wood oven stove in the back. Plus lots of fun gifts and wine for purchase a well. And with a sizable patio outside, you can enjoy it all before heading off to your next adventure.<//Text>< Date>

Very busy sandwich place.  They did have fresh meats and cheeses.  Way too much bread for my personal taste in a sandwich,  but very popular place.  Outdoor seating.  Need better "how to" signage as people seemed confused as to how to pay and where to pay.</Review>

Tasty drip coffee! I stopped here every time I could in the morning to get their dark roast coffee. I even purchased a 1/2 lbs of their whole beans to take home with me.
Staff was very helpful and the store has a great selection of local produce.
Free tasting coupon offered at the register for the winery next door which was pretty good too!
Great place to stop for breakfast or lunch and pick up a souvenir.
Covered seating areas out back to eat/drink at and relax to enjoy the countryside!</Text>

< Review>
I was shocked. I thought I was walking into a small country store to get a couple of bottles of water. This place is amazing! A coffee shop, deli with a LARGE selection of cheeses, kitchen items, beer, wine, and more... all packed into a compact footprint. A highlight of my day.< /Review>

<Review>Convenient little shop where you can pick up snacks and lunch or grab supplies (deli) if you wanted to do an impromptu picnic and enjoy the beautiful outdoors! Or just grab a meal and have a seat right outside after you pay. They have a deli and I hear pizza's good. We didn't get the chance to try their sandwiches or pizzas since we specifically dropped in searching for these delicious breadsticks we tasted at a local winery (along with wine, of course). They also had these amazing truffle salt for sale. I noticed they also had Bouchon bakery goodies for sale, which is kind of awesome because most folks visit Bouchon Bakery just for their macarons and they had some here too, grab some for your picnic basket!</Review>< Pics>

<Text>Always love stopping here for lunch when in wine country. I had the prosciutto and brie on baguette and my hubby had the tuna nicoise sandwich. Both were quite tasty and satisfying.  If you go, stop in the new museum right next door, 1881 Napa, and learn about Napa's history and the early days of the wine industry - such an educational experience. They also offer wine tasting ($45 fee)... go figure!</Text><username>Christiane Highfill< /username><Rating>5</Rating><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp>< user_id>

Perfect place to grab a sandwich, some pasta salad, and a cream soda in between wineries. Take them with you for a winery picnic or stay and eat in their comfortably-misted outdoor area. Food is great, store is great, people are great. This place hits the spot when you're tired of all the frills of Napa Valley.</review>

<Text>While I live in Napa Valley sometimes forget about going to the touristy spots.  Our firms Summer Interns were coming to our St. Helena office for lunch.  Decided to have OVG cater it.  The entire staff was so helpful and Barry, handled all the various dietary requests like a champ. Our firm Partners and Interns loved their various salads and sandwiches.  The cookies were a big hit as well.  Chicken on my salad was so good, flavorful, moist.  The portion is very hearty , enough to share.  The food is much better than I remembered it to be. Also, Dean & Deluca closed. So if you are coming upvalley, be sure to stop at OVG beforehand.  Gourmet, high quality, excellent customer service.  Excellent catering.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Best BLT in town. It is $14 but worth it! So many cheese and snacks to choose from. You can also do wine tasting here. They only have a portable bathroom, that's a down side for a place over charging a sandwich.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x8084544b41c336fd:0x47087a7305951bc9< /GmapID></record>

I love this place!  Been a favorite of mine for 20 years! Some things may be a little overpriced but it's worth it since they have artisan items!  Great stuff from coffee to picnic fair. And am willing to risk even the big crowds</text>

Oakville Grocery is a nice little hidden gem with unique local accoutrements for any lunch, wine day, or even an early dinner. their sandwhiches and salads are remarkable. when we needed a break from the overpriced restaurants, we grabbed a sandwich, some cheeses and a dessert to enjoy with a bottle purchashed that day back at our hotel.< /Review>

Great place for sandwiches with fresh ingredients. They also have a variety of side salads/dishes such as shrimp and grape leaves. Good value local wine and beer available. There are clearly some improvements being made to the buildings so stay tuned.</Text>

How could I rate this less than 5 stars!

Best store for food around. We had a sandwich each which not only tasted amazing, but was a really decent size as well!

There is so much variety of quality food here.

If you are in the area and looking for picnic food, make sure you but your food from here.<//text>

This is exactly what you would expect for a small market in Napa. Select wine, cheese, olives and such. Great deli, espresso, and bake items.  One of our favorite stops for a quick drink and snack. Can get busy in the summer time.</Review>

This place is not a grocery store.  Lol.  But it is a great lil store for local favorites.  Deli, bakery, WINE and lots of local specialty foods and candy.  It's pricey but it's worth it.  Love the marinated olives and the  fresh baked...  everything</text>

<date>1537838341379<//date><Text>Oakville country store has been a regular stop for a beer during a motorcycle rides. I recently stopped in for lunch with friends while touring wineries. The food was pricey and ...ok. They are charging winery prices but are not producing the same quality in my opinion. We spend nearly $80 for two glasses of wine, three sandwiches, and a couple side salads. As earlier reported, the food was bland..~ok. We didn't finish the wine or food, just tossed it. It's a great location, good vibe, but buy something prepackaged, like a beer, cheese and crackers, etc.< /Text><user_id>117361179585360915517</user_id><pics>None< /pics>< rate>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>I am a local living in Napa and have been going to Oakville Grocery for 7 years.  I also own a wine tour company and have personally brought 400-500 guests there for lunch over the last 4 years.  I am sad to say that the complaints/disappointments by my guests and myself have started to exceed the positive experiences.  The icing on the cake was 2 days ago when I called in an order (knowing it was a busy Saturday) for 4 sandwiches and was quoted 30 minutes for them to be ready.  When I came in 1 hour later to pick up the sandwiches, none of them were made; there was one employee actively making sandwiches, 2 employees just talking and one employee working the cash register and a large crowd of guests standing around waiting to pay and get their sandwiches.  This would be similar to Silver Oak, for example, having one employee pouring wine for all of their guests on one of the busiest Saturdays of the year.  Oakville Grocery set a new record of 1 hour and 15 minutes to complete the order for 4 sandwiches.  This is just one of many, many similar experiences which I will not list for times sake.  They have a staff turnover like a revolving door (I see new faces every month and always seem to be "understaffed" when I inquire as to why everything takes so long.  It's unfortunate that a historical property that has been in business since 1881 and knows very well how busy season works from year to year is so poorly managed and provides such poor service.  They even had a chance to make everything flow smoother in 2012 when they remodeled and still did not get it right.<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x8084544b41c336fd:0x47087a7305951bc9</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Everything here is super expensive, but it's wine country... Everything is expensive.  Their ade to order sandwiches are super delicious, so splurge on one of those instead of dropping $100 on a package of cookies, jar of artisan pickles and a beverage.<//review>

Great sandwiches if you're looking to grab a bite on the run while visiting wineries in Napa Valley. They are high quality, made to order, so it's not as fast as a McDonalds, but immeasurably better.<//Text>

Bad, bad store!
I lost my money with more than 180$ in the store. They found it, put it in they safe but didn't give it back!!!!!!!!! No manager helped me, no one answered my emails, they just kept the money.
Before I forgott my purse in the store we shopped in there for more than 172 $ !!!!!! Can you believe that??
Don't go there, they are all thieves!!!!
TERRIBLE!!!! 😡😡😡</Text>

Character driven grocery that serves a nice compliment of dishes that delight and return to a feeling of comfyness. It's a wonderful place to feel like you've stepped back in time to where customer service and quality counts.</Text>

Still good for picnic provisions, but not nearly the "fun find" place it used to be. You can find many of the same items elsewhere in Napa Valley for 20% less or more.<//text>

< review>
Historic place that had a good selection of meats and spices. But now have a meager selection. The staff isnt that friendly and can take a while to get someone's attention for help. Especially if you want something sliced. Other than the remodel witch seems to be taking for ever. Its a cute place.<//review>

Always love this gourmet grocery store and stop to get their homemade vanilla cupcakes ! A perfect place to have lunch or a glass of wine while visiting Napa.</review>

<Text>When it costs $25 for 2 "nitro" coffees and 2 mediocre cookies, there is something wrong.  I'm a Napa native and okay with the fact that things costs more in Napa. But unlike many other places our high prices usually reflect high quality.  I actually am not a big fan of Nitro coffee but since Oakville Grocery doesn't offer iced coffee I went ahead and ordered it.  Usually nitro coffee is creamy with a little bit of a head on it, similar to a beer. My very expensive nitro was really just iced coffee from a beer keg.  In addition I had some friends order $13 sandwiches.  They didn't like the price, but they disliked the service even more.  If you are going to over charge your guests the least you can do it smile at them while doing it.</Text><Rate>2</Rate><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Great place to stop for lunch when touring around Napa. Prices are a bit high for what you get and the selection can be a bit limited compared to other delis.</Review>

The store changed since the last time were there - you can get sandwiches but you cannot buy bread and make your own a little too expensive for my taste< /Review>

Went to Oakford for lunch during my family vacation to Napa. I waited 30+min for my burger and it was messed up multiple times. When it was brought to the staffs attention they were very rude. I fortunately got my money back, but will not be returning on my next trip. I would highly recommend finding somewhere else for lunch.<//text>

When you make an order, you will get a machine that shakes when you finish making paper and order, so go to the cash register with it and pay. I ate BLTA sand, but it was very delicious and very satisfying.

非常に混んでいます！まずは奥のレジ？で注文をすると、紙とオーダーが作り終わるとブルブル震える機械を貰えるので、それをもったままレジに行って支払いをします。私が食べたのはBLTAサンドなのですが、ボリューム満点で非常においしく、満足の高いランチになりました。<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>
