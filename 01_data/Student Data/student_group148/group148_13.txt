Mitchell is the one who everyone seems to dislike. They will add fees to your contract without you knowing. She won't listen to what you have to say because she is always right. You can't ask her for help with a roommate because she will just ask you to move out. And yes you'll have to pay for that too. Don't stay here  find a better place, even yet. Get an apartment with friends, it's way better than living here under her own rules.<//text><date>1621729371977<//date><pics>None</pics>< user_id>

< review>
The amenities here are outstanding and the apartments are nice, but the lack of security made this property a hard no go when looking at places for our daughter.  The property isn't gated so any and everyone can walk onto it. There is no onsite security either. During our tour a homeless guy rode his bike right through the parking lot and we saw another homeless guy wandering near the property as we left.

Side note:  I know you have to explain the options to qualify to rent here.  However when someone tells you their credit is fine, MOVE ON TO YOUR NEXT POINT. I don't need to hear "Well just in case. . ."  and keep reiterating how to qualify if your credit is bad.  It's insulting.<//review>

Apartments are nice but the management and staff is horrible for the most part. The only helpful member I've met was Stephanie. The assistant manager is rude and always making faces at the residents and everyone else & has a very visible attitude problem. They play down your issues and bring up fees you must pay or something unrelated rather than fixing the issue in itself. Security might as well not be available since I called & they said security only works at night but at night i've called had to call security several times and no one ever showed up & all they say is to "document it". Definitely would not recommend if you want to feel at home.< /text>

<review>I have been living here over two years. The reason l choose here is because of short distance to campus.
The buildings and surrounding areas are quite beautiful and clean because every staff here is working very hard to help residents have a better life. And also the leasing office have a group of very kind and friendly officers working for us. Some of them are also Sac students. Another shining spot is that here have the best clubhouse compare with other communities which include study area, gym, coffee corner and so on. Besides that, I really glad here provides the Envoy electric car for rent which is super cheap and convenient.
However, no place is perfect. Some bad things happened sometimes from all aspects. Crazy party, and random people coming inside. Not all residents follow the rules, some of them just too young to think about others. These people have their right to have their life, this is something we can’t change. The good thing is the manager group is trying to fix everything. I already saw around 5 different security companies try to provide better service.
To sum up, this place is no perfect but its more than my expected.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Okay here is a brutally honest review of the Crossings Student Apartments. I've lived here for over a year & I can realistically say that this is the nicest apartment complex in Sacramento for the price. I do believe that many of the issues you may read in other reviews have occurred due to lack of respect of many of the residents/friends of residents that live here, however recently under new management there have been no issues at all & seems like things have been addressed accordingly (as far as guest policies, security presence, parking etc.)

As a resident I understand how busy staff can get & I know they do the best that they possibly can to get their work done. I have had nothing but positive interactions with the staff & management & recently was able to set up an appointment with the property manager to fix an issue with my account which she promptly resolved. I simply just had to send her an email & my appointment was the next day.

As busy and hard working as the staff can get, I know they do not have the time to fix some of minor issues some residents may have. But I genuinely do enjoy living here & can say that the majority of the residents here are very pleasant & friendly.

I would 10/10 recommend this apartment complex to anyone who may be going to Sacramento State (or surrounding schools/job) come Spring/Summer 2021.

By the way, you will not find a better fitness center at any complex in the Sacramento area.</Text>

<Review>I was interested in moving into the apartment at The Crossings back in October 2020. But when I went and took a tour and I talked to some residents after my tour and a lot of residents, and they told how it really is living at this student living apartment complex. The residents told me that the staff of The Crossings treat their residents horribly, terribly they are just money hungry they don’t care about the people they are trying to serve. They are not very good at doing roommate matching and they don’t handle any roommate problems at all. They try to take the easy way out instead of listening to each individual and having sympathy, and empathy for different situations that people are going through. They absolutely allow bullying in their apartments amongst their residents and they only make harder for their residents to live. Lastly The Crossings staff hates bad 1 star reviews and will call you up personally and then have the audacity to beg you to change your bad 1 review into a good 5 star review.< /Review>< pics>

Some shady behavior resulted in me being told to sign a lease under the impression that it was not a lease, and once I signed they wouldn't let me out and held me financially responsible.

After this it took constant work on my part to stay on top of them to work with me on a sublet which ended up taking longer than it should have because management wrote the contract incorrectly the 1st time.

They removed my previous review... they post fake reviews on google. They also force employees to make reviews as well. Which I don’t think is legal. Management is rude and needs to be changed. Front staff is amazing though and very kind. They are the only reason I’m giving one star. If I could it would be zero. I also don’t think it’s fair their gym is open when all gyms can’t even be open right now in Sacramento county. Their pool is also open and it attracts many non residents who have giant parties. Police are always on property.</Text>

Just renewed my lease for the fall. The staff did a great job with roommate matching! Me and my roommate have become fast friends! This was huge for me, I've had several roommates from HELL. And did I mention the pool! Hands down one of the best complex pools I've seen.</review>

Although the complex is very nice and has a variety of amenities Majority if the staff have not been responsive nor helpful. They don't take residences need to accounts and over charge for a number of things. I.E maintenance issues, move in fees. They also don't accommodate or help current residents. They're honestly just looking to fill the rooms and don't take into account how you feel while living here. This is just based off personal experiences.</Text>

<Review>The Crossing is a nice place. The only issue is with security. Security rather have cars towed then worry about the residents property. Car's windows are being broken into. My vehicle was broken into early this month.  My same vehicle was towed by Security. When I request for a parking pass it did take a few days for a response from the property manager.</Review>< Time>

Having lived at residence for almost two years, I've had nothing but bad experiences with both the area and management. The area is literally on the wrong side of the train tracks, meaning it's located in a more of a industrial area verses a neighborhood. Because of it's location its prone to ongoing car vandalism. My car was vandalized twice within 5 months, once parked in the property's parking lot and the other was parked on the street just up the block. I've also have seen multiple cars broken into as they too were parked on the property's lot. During my first year I paid an extra $20 per month to be able to park within the property's parking lot. After resigning my lease for a second year the management raised the parking permit fee by 5 times to $100 per month!! Wouldn't you agree that is taking advantage of residents or what? Whats even more ridiculous is after charging that much money they won't even spend the money to provide more security to guard against the ongoing car thefts. The front office staff needs to learn how to be more welcoming and customer service oriented. The multiple times I've walked into the office I didn't feel welcomed nor was the management making any efforts to change it. All i all, I wouldn't feel comfortable in reccommending this student housing.< /text>

This is my second semester living at The Crossings and I just recently renewed for another year here!  Living at The Crossings so far has been really beneficial to both myself and my fiancee.
There are a ton of great amenities like the 24/7 gym, and the shuttle to school, which makes getting to and from the campus easy and safe.  The Crossings also offers a private bedroom and bathroom for every room, which is a huge plus for me! I have lived at multiple apartment complexes since I started college, and The Crossings by far has felt the most comfortable and home-like to me!<//review>

This places residential services are the worst. They changed the lock to my room and didn’t tell me and left me no key so I was locked out my room. They came to unlock it and the girl from the office said she’d make a work order to get me a new key and the never gave me one. Another girl came to check which key it is so she could go make it and she never did so once again I am locked out and they’re not answering the phone.< /Review>

First off the student staff that work in the leasing office are super nice and helpful, but management is a negligent at best. I have lived here for almost two years and me and my roommate were thinking about renewing our lease for a third year but after being placed with a bad roommate at the start of this year and trying on multiple occasions to move rooms. Nothing has happened. Two of my other roommates have just moved out and are still paying rent because of how obnoxiously loud and messy our other roommate has been. BE WARNED: if you get paired up with a bad roommate you are stuck with them for the duration of the lease and management will give you the run around even if your living situation makes you dread coming home. I wouldn't recommend the crossings to anyone close to me and after living here for two years I advise if you are reading this to steer clear of the crossings.<//text>

I have lived her for almost two years, going onto my third.
Overall, I have enjoyed living here.
I like how close to campus it is. It is about a ten minute walk to campus but they also have a shuttle. I like that everything is included in the rent like utilities, cable and wifi. I never have to worry about other bills which is something I really looked for when I decided to move off campus. I was not never familiar with Sacramento when I ended my first year and moving here made it easier for me. This was a lot better than living in the dorms because I get my own room and bathroom.
I definitely recommend living here!< /text>

I’d give this place zero stars if I could. I had the worst living experience here, my roommate was beyond words impossible to live with and I wrote to the office and to the manager only for them telling me they wouldn’t do anything since the start. He was doing illegal activities for months and kept everyone awake deep into the am. After moving out they overcharged me as much as they could $500 for a carpet. Claiming something positive out of a no deposit fee but overcharging me when the apartment was immaculate itself. Cars keep on getting broken into as well as robberies. They will not help you once that happens claiming non-responsibility. Save your money and live elsewhere.<//Review>

Apartments are super loud and constantly CONSTANTLY smell like pot. The staff are pretty accommodating but not always sympathetic to problems. My roommates and I had a smoke alarm going off for a week before something was finally done. The fire alarms also go off pretty frequently. It’s so convenient to be near campus but it’s not a great place to live especially considering it’s so dang expensive.<//review>

Management ignores emails and the property charges a unnecessary amount for parking ($110 a month)  with no spaces actually available for all the residents. No guest parking at all, those without parking have to park a 10 minute walk away from the property. The crossings is trash< /text>

Maybe you should stop by the office so that we can update your contact information as we feel shocked by this news. Also, you are correct we do not have spaces for all residents which is why they are charged $110.00 for a specific spot which (as you may know) we reinforce towing and have security patrol to help compensate for the cost. We also wanted to point out that we do offer a more cost effective option which is tandem and that is only $65.00 per month and may seem more suitable to you. Unfortunately we must also relay that we have no legal rights or power in regards to the cities restrictions on street parking. If you are upset we highly recommend reaching out to your local representative. I have also scheduled a follow up for you in regards to your several concessions you were awarded.

<review>I had positive experiences at this place until 4-5 months after I had moved out. With no contact from the property management, they directly had a debt collection agency affect mine and my guarantor's credit score for non-payment of dues worth $315!! - approx. half of it for cleaning and half for missing keys. Despite leaving the apartment pretty clean I would've still paid the cleaning fees had they asked me directly. However, I had returned all my keys and signed a move-out form to that effect. I was still charged for it. They were unresponsive to a request for locating my move-out form. I had to pay the dues to get the credit scores back. Moral - Keep records and copies of all transactions made with this management (if you decide to stay here). Good apartments but the after-taste was horrible.< /review><username>Harshavardhan Kalbhor<//username><resp>{'time': 1582756018834, 'text': "We're sorry you had a negative experience, Harshavardhan.

< Review>
I moved in fall of 2018 and I knew that since they were brand new apartments that there would be issues but I figured they would have everything figured out by now. That’s not the case. I have had several problems with them that I never cared to express in a review but seeing how desperate they are for good reviews that they had the actual MANAGER (Lisa Corey) write a five star review just threw me over the edge. That just shows how terrible of a place this is that the employees have to write five star reviews to make this place look great.
The first thing that happened to me when I moved in was that my car’s tail light was smashed by someone else’s car in the parking lot. I didn’t see when it happened but I woke up to that in the morning and when I went in to talk to a manager about it to see if they could show me in the cameras who did it, the only response I got from one of the employees was “the managers aren’t in right now but they are coming in tomorrow, you can write down your name, phone number and what happened and we will pass this along....” NEVER heard back. I honestly didn’t care to continue to ask after a couple days went by because I wasn’t going to waste my time chasing down the manager. After that incident, the main problem was and still is parking. I would think that if I pay for general parking that I would get to come home to a parking spot, well that’s not the case. I understand I don’t pay for a reserved parking spot but everyone who pays for general parking should be able to find one because after all they didn’t sell parking to every resident. They say they remove cars from the parking lot if they have no parking pass but if that were actually true I wouldn’t have to circle the parking lot at midnight after I come home from work trying to find a parking spot. A couple days ago (2/13/19) I tried speaking to a manager about an issue I had with them, but of course the manager wasn’t available and the employee told me that she would pass on the message to her manager so that I could get a call back. I wanted to speak immediately with a manager but it is now 2/16/19 and I still haven’t gotten a call back. To all the people trying to rent for next semester, if you really want to live here just be sure that you know what you’re getting yourselves into before signing the lease.< /Review>

<text>Place is honestly beautiful and the amenities are amazing. Unfortunately management is practically nonexistent. The only thing they stick to in that leasing agreement is that you can't get out of it. Everything else in that contract is meaningless, they don't act on any of what is written in there. I explained to them about one of my roommates threatening me and my other roommates for them to basically ignore us, AND THE AGREEMENT WE HAD IN THAT LEASE. I honestly feel management there has no idea what they are doing. I don't feel safe in my living conditions and all they could offer me was to transfer rooms but my rent would be more expensive. If you honestly have the patience to do with this kind of stuff and alot more, then you don't have much to worry about I guess.<//text>< name>

<Review>This place is okay. Very expensive, but worth it. Has a shuttle from the crossings to sacstate, which can be nice since to have a car on the property is hella expensive. The gym is cool too, when the equipment is up and running. The environment is nice until you cross the tracks. I really enjoy the study rooms. Also i really like how you can lock your bike up inside the buildings.</Review></record></dataset><record>

WARNING: DO NOT LEASE HERE!! You are better off at the Lark Apartments or even the Element. Plus those apartments are closer to Target and food places like Bento Box and Wing Stop so u can easily walk there.  Crossings is trash, LITERALLY! When I first came here the dumpsters were overloaded with junk, absolutely limited parking (which is so inconvenient), and the place was dirty even when it just opened. I don’t/ didn’t live here but a friend of mine does and she told me all about how the place was awful and didn’t truly believe her until I saw it myself. The management is a bunch of college students who do NOT know how to do their job and act professionally. Whoever designed the place was not bright because when you open the door to the apartment, it hits the refrigerator. Also, when my friend first moved in, the blinds/ window was broken. Obviously you can submit a work order, but seriously just when the place opened??? People expect everything to be clean, fixed, and in shipped-shaped, especially when it’s brand new. The pool is also very dirty and I swear they have like 2 or 3 buses (again so inconvenient). Plus my friends who live there say the bus times are random. The Lark and Element has one bus that operates in a timely and organized manner, no need for more than 1 bus. SAVE YOUR MONEY, SAVE YOUR TIME, LIVE A GOOD COLLEGE EXPERIENCE SOMEWHERE ELSE. PERIOD.</text>

I dont have to make a long communte since its only .03 miles away from campus. There’s an on-site 24/7 gym, anf free printing on site that makes doing papers a lot easier. If youre looking for an (student housing ) apartment close to campus I would higly reccomend The Crossings :)</Text>< pics>

<review>Don't come here. Their management team is nothing but Sac State students that have no clue what they're doing or at the very least how to manage an apartment complex for not only student, but for small families as well. Their maintenance team is extremely rude, some don't speak English so communication is out if you don't know Spanish, but thankfully not all of them are or this place would get a zero star from me dog. You hear them unlocking your door before you have time to get to it and in the first knock,  when you're in the bathroom mind you. They changed it to where you can park in the parking lot now but that's just recent. Before you would hear the tow truck everyday. People get robbed around here every weekend and last month a party turned sour and a guy got ran over by a car. They're crazy slow in fixing anything broken in your apartment as well. Just don't live here okay?<//review><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

The apartments and amenities are nice, and have individual rooms/bathrooms and a large common area, plus it's pet friendly! But the office staff seem less knowledgeable than they should be (I have gotten different answers for the same question without either employee double-checking w/ a manager/other worker even though they seemed unsure). There doesn't seem to be a manager or person in charge either, so it's hard to get a solid answer/correct info out of them. Plus it's not student only living so there is no 9 month lease, even though the majority of residents are students, and they are unhelpful in assisting residents with finding people to take over leases (even though I was told they would have a list of interested people when I signed the lease- instead I got sent to random fb page that's not even affiliated with the Crossings). So yeah- summary is nice apartment/apartment complex but staff need better training and a manager available at all times.<//Text>

The Crossings A.K.A The Projects
If you’re looking for a place where the police actually shows up this is the place, they are here every weekend. Don’t get me wrong this place is a sanctuary, for homeless people who wander in the buildings and stalk young girls. This place also offers complimentary wake up calls at 4am from the train track across the street and Weed scented hallways. Thats not the only place it gets “LOUD” the buildings fire alarms constantly go off from people smoking, it’s that lit! The staff here are amazing, they managed to fool the company into thinking they are actually capable of running the place, don’t ask them a question because it will throw them off if they ACTUALLY have to do their job. So live here and pay a lot of money for pre-trashed rooms and a shuttle to campus that comes by every 40 minuets, if the driver feels like it.< /Text>

< Review>
I would give them a -10 if I could. Employees are NEGLIGENT. They said they would switch my lease to a two bed, but instead failed to do their job. Never even put that information in the system. Now it's too late, and I'm trapped in my 4 bedroom lease with random maniacs. It's dirty here (hallways, windows, carpets, stairs) and the rooms are CHEAP. Paint peels off and furniture breaks easily. Most of all, management is the devil. They apologize, but that is IT. Nothing will ever change here, it will always run by irresponsible staff members who obviously don't know what they're doing. I would be ashamed, and mainly EMBARRASSED to work here. I would feel so guilty if I was the manager, forcing residence to live in unfair conditions just because of a staff that doesn't lift a finger. You call it student living when you only serve yourself. SHAME ON ALL OF YOU THAT WORK HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When are you actually going to do your job?< /Review>

So i recently just moved here 3 weeks ago and everything seemed fine at first. Upon me signing and paying for my lease i did the online application which allowed me to pick which parking i wanted to add. So all the option were available including the general parking which is $20 so I chose that option. When I was receiving my keys and paid I assumed everything I had picked from my application would all add up to the total amount I was suppose to pay including the parking. So i get settled in and I'm enjoying staying here. Just last night they sent out a message via text to all the residents here saying they were going to start towing cars because of the lack of spaces here but only if you don't have a parking permit. So in my mind I'm thinking I'm okay because they didn't mention ANYTHING to me at time of payment. I even went in my second week here to update my car information because i brought a different car than the one i put in my application. They still didn't mention that I didn't pay for parking when they literally saw that I had a car!!! So when I wake up this morning to go run errands, i come out to my car being gone. I went to the leasing office knowing that my car had been towed and i let them know and they pull up my profile and say "Oh yeah it says here you were never charged for a parking permit, so there's nothing we can do to help you." WHY COULDN'T THEY HAVE TOLD ME THIS THE FIRST DAY I CAME OR ALL THE OTHER DAYS I WAS IN THE LEASING OFFICE. I had to pay $280 out of pocket because of their lack of communication. There are cars out in the parking lot right now that have flat tires and are inoperable. It clearly states in the crossings OWN lease that inoperable cars are to be removed from the premises. So a broken down car gets a parking spot and I don't??? I think this is ridiculous. I shouldn't have to pay for the towing when they couldn't even communicate and let people know that they are SOLD OUT of all parking spots but still allow people to add it as part of their rent each month. I now have to park a mile away on Cucamonga which is really inconvenient having to leave for work at 3am. If something happens to me or my car, I will be filing a lawsuit. This place has really bad management.<//review>

<review>The crossings is a joke. They don't care about the security and safety of their residents at all. If they did this place would have been a gated community from the day it opened. We constantly get cars broken into, girls feel unsafe walking at night, yet the crossings constantly points blames on the victims. they don't take any of our safety complaints seriously at all. I know for a fact that plenty of people will not be renewing there lease just for safety reasons. THE CROSSINGS NEEDS TO BECOME A GATED COMMUNITY, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ONE SINCE THEY OPENED.

There is no parking when free parking was stated as an amenity, as a result I am forced to park a half mile away. There are needles on my walk to my car, and have been cat called by transients; overall, I do not feel safe walking alone to my car. The rooms are nice, but the construction was obviously rushed so there are many flaws.< /text>

<Text>Imma give this a 1. Yes and I live here. Unless you love not getting straight answers from our management, love having MULTIPLE CARS get broken into, slashed tires, stolen bikes, awful security, pay for parking but not guaranteed a spot, also no guest parking, and staff that complain about every little thing and huff and Puff if you ask about anything because they all are college students that aren't trained for this kind of work. I'd live at the Elements they have all great reviews and all my college friends love it! Everyone gets a spot and one for a friend! And your right by Target and multiple food places.

I get harassed by calls from them. They call me multiple times a day to see if I am still interested in leasing (after getting my number from an incomplete application I started just to see their rent prices) and despite blocking two of their numbers they continue to call. I have answered and hung up and not expressed any sense of interest in renting with them. It gets very annoying, the rent is far too expensive (like most student housing) and their incessant calling makes me think they are desperate to fill rooms.< /text>

<text>Whatever you do, DO NOT LEASE HERE. The management are crooks and will do anything they can to scam you and pay off their huge mortgage. They are run by unprofessional, young college kids who literally said they got this job for a discount on campus. And  the management has you fill everything out on an IPad, including the lease, but they refuse to let you know what to sign. They told me " just keep signing it's the APPLICATION PROCESS" BULLCRAP. They are scammers. So sketchy glad I left before signing anything. Management continued to call and bother me. Take your time elsewhere and do not be fooled by their 3d pictures of the place. They want one thing. TO TARGET YOUNG STUDENTS WHO HAVE NO CREDIT, who are vulnerable and naive to the system ,and they will scam you as much as they can. Be very weary.</text></record>

Don’t do it!!!! This is the worst housing option I’ve ever experienced in my life. Your better off choosing local student housing such as the Elements or The Lark Apartments. They actually have security that do their job. Countless nights I would come home and security would be in lobby’s hanging out and not doing their job. I feel like I’ve wasted all my money here. The parking situation is more then a mess (with or without a permit) there’s no parking near the apartments , you have to park almost A half mile away which absolutely unsafe in this sketch area. My car got broken into, window gone, items stolen. That was an easy $240 dollars for the window. Guess what? When you park on Ramona ave ( closest street to apts) that’s another $52 ticket the city gives you. I reached out to staff and management numerous times and I’m extremely disappointed because it comes across as if they don’t really care and pretty much tell you to deal with it. No solutions are provided with these people! This has affected my sleep and caused anxiety in my life because I literally go to sleep in complete fear thinking about wether my car will be either towed or broken into. Lisa ( Property Manager) has not been responsive to emails at all which is very frustrating.  If your reading this please avoid this property at all COST! Trust me when I say that. :(</Review>

For any sort of help they will charge you but when it comes to their mess up and issues then "no one is at fault" according to them.

<review>Initial rating is not that good.  Walkway to get kids to school is not done and won't be done till December.  Bus shuttle system not solidly in place and left daughter stranded at school after 850pm class.  Parking expectations and policies are a mess.  Maybe the stuff above is just because they are new.
AC system in room sounds like a 747 on takeoff.  Loudness policy at night does not appear to be enforced.<//review><UserId.>113907662975101777915< /UserId.><gmapID>0x809ada917f3b4691:0x858595c41757348c< /gmapID><Name>Royce Hays< /Name></record></dataset><record>

If I could give The Crossings 0 STARS, I would!! As a parent, you want your child to be at a good place. Wow we weredeceived! There is an extreme disconnect in communication.  The student workers can do nothing when you need help or an issue resolved.  They use the phase” our managers have to take care of that”. There is NEVER a manager or staff of the correct level at the facility to assist you.  Every single worker has a different answer for the same question.  I have tested this theory.  Once they have roped you in to singing a lease with their empty promises ( There are still residents that have not gotten the gift card they were promised last year in January for signing up) you learn that you will not have a place to park even if you paid for a reserved place. They tell you that you can park along Ramona at your risk of getting a $40 parking ticket or you can park without the risk of a ticket about 4-5 blocks away from the Crossings and then walk. At night along the street, there are TONS of homeless people, mostly men who hang out there.  They have harassed the young women when they have been walking to their apartments due to NO PARKING WITHIN 5 BLOCKS OF THEIR HOUSING.  The Crossings doesn’t provide sercuity on the street.  Would you want your daughter walking in the dark past cat calling homeless men? I certainly don’t.  I was given the “lip service “ and told that the shuttle driver will pick anyone up who they see walking.  My daughter has rode the shuttle for 6 months and not once has it stopped for a resident walking.  There is not a shuttle after 8pm and often times earlier, so they would not be able to stop and pick up anyone after dark when it is the most scetchy.
Now let’s move on to the building. It was brand new in Aug when students started moving in and I think my idea of brand new and this corporations is definitely not the same.  The floors were dirty, the elevator was always filthy and had who knows what on walls.  The apartments had worker shoe prints on the floors in common area that have never come off.  Appliances did not work correctly and there were not blinds up in the bedrooms.  After our daughter lived there for awhile, there began to be dog poop left in the hallways ( you have cameras use them and make them clean it up) and on the stairs in the stairwell which had to be used a lot because the elevator was not working.  Dog poop left in hallways and stairs I’m sure is a health hazard.  This was left for 1 week without anyone stopping to clean it up. I would highly recommend not spending your money on this apartments for your child.  It might seem like a good deal, but all the issues that the students and parents have to deal with are not worth it.  Our child will NOT be returning to this facility in the fall.  The only difference between the corporation that owns these apartments and a slum lord is the corporation makes its self look good.
Don’t bother replying to me with your “I’m sorry you feel this way bull.... “. It absolutely means nothing. if you were truly sorry, you would go out of your way to fix everything and make these apartments a true 5 star place.  There are so many issues with this corporation, facility, and surrounding areas that I do not recommend anything lease through them! Empty promises!!< /Text>

Shuttles promised to arrive every 15 minutes, actually arrive every 40 minutes and then suddenly have mechanical issues. The staff dont seem properly trained. The office hours here are seriously narrow for a living complex. (Like the shuttle runs longer than the office hours meaning students can still experience issues when they arrive back at the complex but the office would be closed) The hall maintenance here seems non-existant. Many services that's were promised have not yet been made available and the parking? Don't even bother. They leave items in the gym and recreational areas unattended resulting in objects already being stolen by the 3rd week of being open.</review>< userid>

ALSO, THEY KEEP ADDING RESERVED PARKING, PUSHING AWAY ALL OTHER TYPES OF PARKING! SUPER UNPROFESSIONAL AND MANAGERS WILL NOT RETURN YOUR CALL. CANT WAIT TILL MY LEASE IS UP.

So I pay $100 for parking and not only do I not have a place to park but they towed my car!!!! I have been in that office everyday and they just act like they don't care! I have been living here a week and it's literally in the top 2 worse places I've stayed. The people who work in the front office need a reality check. I just can't believe I'm waiting my Money here. After they tell you to park anywhere, they towed your car. The apartment are cheaply made and parking is the worst thing I've ever experienced aside from Sac State . The attitude of these people are only nice when you're signing your life away to them but when you have signed, you're nobody and THEIR ISSUES are yours. The apartments are decent but people who work here need training ASAP . HOW HARD IS IS IT TO PUT A NUMBER ON CONCRETE FOR RESERVED PARKING THAT I PAY FOR only to be towed . Thought this place was better 👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎👎
Edit : they fixed most of the issues quickly after I made multiple reviews so not so bad now. Wish I could get a refund for the tow after spending so much money here already.</Text>

< Review>
Not a resident but have been affected by parking situation we own a business about 1000ft from the back side of roundabout we have never had a problem getting steel delivered to our company but from the day they started renting it's been nothing but problems there is no order to the parking of some 200 cars each morning it's a roll of the dice to find ouyt if you will be able to acess your business.At first we were forced to drive our forklift nearly a quarter of a mile to get outside of roundabout to receive or steel order we would unload transfer from steel truck to one of our vehicles then unload again once back at our shop  a very large inconvienence,on certain occasions the truck would get through but do to the difficulty for their driver to navigate the roundabout due to cars parked within it,we were informed our supplier will no longer SELL TO US.I would like some acknoledgement of this problem and a time frame of when or if it is going to be taken care of .Rumor has it 350 parking spaces were provided for 750 beds "really", that is not only disrespectfull  i think it is gross neglegence and a code infraction.My lip has been well bitten expecting change soon.</Review>

This place is AWFUL with communication. They usually never answer and return phone calls at the minimum 2 days after call. The office staff seem more than confused on basic questions and never reach out to offer help. Still behind on construction that was suppose to be complete over a month ago. Overall clean space, just bad customer service.<//Review>

I had a great experience with ConnectEnglish! The school offers students effective, engaging, and challenging online classes. The teachers such as Chris, Gabe, Michael, Elsa, Ryan and the others are engaging, lively, patient, kind, encouraging, motivating and open minded. Megan is always eager to help. Director Nick is very energetic and enthusiastic. I'll miss you all! Thank you, wish you the best of luck!</text>

I’m getting old. As a result, it’s really hard to learn new skills, even a new language. Connect English provided me an awesome learning environment, with excellent teachers, staff, books and activities. I was able to improve my english with different methodologies. One of the best things is that you interact with students with different accents. It helps you to get a better English listening. I feel I can travel around the world and have a great English communication anywhere.
I’d like to thank you everyone from Connect English. You guys made it happen!</review>

I came across Connect English last year when I was looking for the school in SD. So this year I decided to go back to California to study English with this school. The assistant, the teachers, the incredible director Nick left highly impression on me. I love core, skills classes, and they also have free pronunciation and slang classes. With any level of knowledge you feel comfortable.<//review>

<Text>An exemplary school. If you intend to study English in San Diego-CA, choose Connect, without a doubt the best of all. The teachers are excellent and are always willing to teach. The administrative team is highly qualified to resolve any type of demand, including supporting immigration processes. You feel welcomed in all ways. The school provides several programs at no cost, all to make you feel integrated into American culture. There are films, tours, extra classes, and many other things. It is a safe and serious school. Anyway, I joined Connect at Level 3 and left completing Level 5 with great joy and ready for new challenges.<//Text><time>1606863635816<//time><Gmap_id>0x80d955cf462e6aad:0x97edd956dfd426d0</Gmap_id><user_name>Winy Mello<//user_name></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend Connect English school, and here is why. While studying there, I loved friendly environment, amazing teachers, and unique atmosphere. Moreover, their creative approach to the learning process results in a great development of English skills, which I experienced myself. The staff was supportive all the way and made my educational journey more enjoyable. All of the above are the reasons why I would like to come back to Connect English school again in the future.< /text>

Studing at Connect English was great, I’d improved my English a lot, I could had learned a lot of new words and studied grammar also. The teachers are amazing and the way that they run the classes make you feel comfortable to talk even if you don’t have a lot of vocabulary. For sure I would recommend Connect English.< /review>

It is because we are concerned with students' learning. We are concerned with your learning too, and will gladly have a conversation with you about it. We are always willing to communicate with our students about policies and programs, as a good education is our #1 priority. That is why our policies are made so clear to our students.

I attended this school for only 3 months but I learned a lot. Also I took private lessons once a week. It’s really good to improve my English. I can learn what I want to learn. For me I really want to improve pronunciation so I asked my teacher to teach me and then my pronunciation has improved. So I highly recommend you take private lessons if you want to study English seriously.</review>

I have studied in Connect English for 12 months.  It was the excellent experience. I got a lot of helpful knowledge. The teachers are very professional and friendly.  For example: Megan, Brandon, Jonathan, Steph, Joe and Kaz.  The administrative staff are responsible and helpful.
Thank you very much for everything.</text>

The school was really good.  Definitely the best teachers I have had and really motivate me to learn.  I was very nervous when I first travel my first time to another county but Connect staff made me comfortable.  I will recommend for good price and service.

The school administration was good and teachers amazing.  I hope to come back soon to San Diego!   Thanks.<//review>

<review>I had a terrible experience with this school. Some of their employees are extremely dishonest, irresponsible and unprofessional. They don't care about students at all. After providing misleading information regarding program start dates, tuition, orientation, payments and and other policies, instead of apologizing and taking responsibly for their mistakes, they made it sound like it was the student's fault (which it clearly wasn't) and made the student pay hundreds of dollars for it. I tried contacting them multiple times to clarify the situation and find mutual understanding. However, their responses have been extremely selfish and unhelpful. Obviously they have no idea what customer service is and what is takes to be a respectful establishment. It's so shameful to take advantage of poor students who don't know their rights in the USA.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1547177590220, 'text': "Dear Charlie,\n\nI am one of the founders of Connect English.

The cheapest school in San Diego to keep your student VISA while you are doing "something else" If that what you need then I have nothing to say. However, If you come to the US for education you should not waste your time here. Community colleges are the better choice for you. Grossmont, Mesa, City, Mira Mesa are the popular community colleges in San Diego. Just do some research then you will see.<//Review>

The teachers the staff of the school are very professional, easy going and helpful.  The instalations are very good. I liked the classes. The school is interested in the feedback. And because of that I think that the last week it started to become much better the free pronunciation classes of the afternoon. Altough I liked the classes, I hope the school would focus more on the oral skills of the students to improve them. The writting classes are excelent. I would choose again Connect English<//text>

I’ve been tutoring ESL students for over 15 years. I fell in love with it during my AmeriCorps service from 2000-2002 in Santa Rosa. When I moved to San Diego, I supplemented my income as a stay at home mom with tutoring ESL students across the city. I’ve worked with Alliant International University, Education First, and Connect English students and have noticed over the years that Connect English students demonstrate the biggest improvement over time. Their retention rate is noticeably highest of all my clients. Their accents, spelling, punctuation, grammar and even use of colloquialisms show marked improvements that build upon themselves. I care about all the clients I work with, but I notice myself consistently looking forward to time with Connect English students. They are simply the happiest bunch of clients that I work with. And the most fun, and funny! Somehow, Connect English provides an education not just in the proper use of the English language, but also in socializing with native English speakers. It’s hard enough to master an entirely new language, let alone be able to make your tutor laugh so hard she cries. My only wish is that Connect English would offer summer language camps for English-speaking schoolchildren, so that my child could reap the benefits of such a comprehensive learning experience.</text>

I spent good moments with my colleagues from around the world. Jill, teach our class and his classes are very entertaining and educational. Pronunciation classes were very funny, Nick put a camera and he record a live from Facebook and people around the world can comment the live video, so it was very interesting.
The school also proposed some activities to have fun, personally the idea which caught my attention was kayak because I love sea activities, we had fun there and I met new friends. Fantastic!!! I would definitely recommend this school to everybody and I would like to thank the staff.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I'm very upset about the experience of studying at Connect English. After my favorite teacher left, I don't think international students should study English at Connect. They take advantage of international students. I didn't attend any classes but they only refund me half of my payment. Also, they charged me extra late fee.< /text>

The staff was kind and relatable, and definitely took their time to make sure I was successful.

<user>113030772925616490874< /user><Text>This is the worst school in San Diego. The workers there just care about your money. It looked a suspicious school for just charge 400 dollars a month, but I gave it a shot and I tried it. I took the advanced class in the afternoon with the toefl preparation for 1 month. It was time wasting for me, the class was just writting and we didn´t have so much time to practice the fundamental ability: SPEAKING. Aside from that, I noticed that most of their students just attend the school for the simple fact of staying with their student visa valid, and due to the small price of course. So they can work on the side and attend the school at the same time. IF YOU HAVE MONEY , LIMITED TIME AND ARE WILLING TO LEARN ENGLISH DON´T GO TO THIS SCHOOL. Furthermore, one of their school´s location have closed due to not meet the governments requirements.</Text><resp>{'time': 1532573631787, 'text': "Hi Maria,\n\nNobody with the first name Maria has been in our TOEFL classes since 2016. No Connect English schools have ever closed for not meeting government requirements. And if you are in the afternoon TOEFL program, the format is to do academic reading one day per week, listening one day per week, speaking one day per week, and at least one written essay per week to get students ready for the four elements of the TOEFL exam. Are you sure that you have written a review about the right school? It sounds like you're not describing Connect English.

I am pretty sure that they are the best! I was in TOEFL max class, but fortunately it was more than  TOEFL preparation. We studied pronounciation, grammar, and all the skills that anybody needs in a foreign language. And the best was that I enjoied the classes so much that I did not want to miss any classes. Nick is the funniest and the best English teacher I've ever met. My English improved unbelievably fast. After only a month I passed the TOEFL test with 97 points. Now I am a student at the legal master program at the University of San Diego. The knowledge I got at Connect English is always with me.
But I still miss Connect English... What a shame that they are so effective, that I've already had to leave them to pursue my further goals.< /review><user_id>102668636946820121032< /user_id>< Date>

Toefl class is famous with it's teacher, and teacher does big effort to improve student's abilities & knowledge. You may see some persons who came from other states just for that Toefl class.
I would suggest anyone to try Connect English before applying somewhere else.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<userid>101894084163802776882<//userid>< Review>
My name is Simon Tetreault and I’m from Quebec, Canada. Since we speak French in Quebec not English, I had to find a way to improve my English skills. I chose Connect English because a friend of mine strongly referred it to me.

At first, I took the English Max level 5 (speaking and learning). It was amazing, my speaking fluency progressed quickly. Meanwhile the skill class (slang) taught me important skills for informal speeches.

After a month I changed to the “toefl” class. The teacher was awesome even though her opinions weren’t always coinciding with my viewpoints. Therefore, she had a way of freezing words in my brain as I never experienced before. This course combined with the business skills class was a “Red bull” boost for new vocabulary.

My whole trip lasted 8 weeks and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who wants to improve their English skills. Don’t be reluctant,
San Diego weather + Connect English = Perfect Match!!<//Review>

<text>I've been for a month studying at Connect English and for sure was the best experience that I've had in years.
The atmosphere and attendance are unique at San Diego Campus where we're treated as a family. They can help in any subject that envolve the city and the methodology is not boring like others schools.
The teachers are really awesome which make all the difference (particularlly Leilani and Kirk).<//text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80d955cf462e6aad:0x97edd956dfd426d0</Gmap_id></record>

The teacher is a perfect guy. He knows how to find a balance between working hard and having fun at the same time. It is also a perfect way to know people worldwide. I will defenitely recomend this institute to everybody. Thank you for everything!<//Text>< userid>

Connet english is the best school i have ever gone.  I highly reccommend to TOEFL class. Soraya is very unconventional teacher. She makes me motivated all the time. Also the quality school with the nice price.</review>

< Review>
Soraya's Toefl class can be challenging, however it's the most effective and comprehensive EAP class I've ever taken.
Since I've been in this, I can see myself tremendously enhance my capacity in English.
Not only the proficient strategies I've acquire, but also many kind of tachniques that I can use them in my real life.

Moreover, Ryan is really helpful teacher, I have him as my skill teacher. I feel like I got the best combination teachers :)
They both give me a lot of positive energy

Thank you

By far, I'll recomend this school to my friends and family who's interested in studay abroad.< /Review>

Hi, my name is Aigul
I participated in the Connec English San Diego program. I enjoyed it thouroughly, l learned a lot and I am excited to go home a show my co -workers what I learned. The teachers was really good and my classmates were friendly as well. The institute takes a very professional approach to teaching it's students, So in short I loved it and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn English.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Connect English is a serious educational institution with solid values, excellent teachers and facilities. In addition, it has a calendar full of fun activities to socialize students with each other. They were very attentive to me whenever I needed and they attended to all my needs. Now I am entering a vocational course at a university and I feel able to take this next step thanks to what I learned at Connect. I will keep in my heart all the moments I had there.

Guardarei em meu coração todos os momentos que tive lá.</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I have studied in the Connect English language school for more than two years. I learned English from Level 2 to the TOEFL class, and successfully applied to the university I want to go to.

I think the learning here is the most cost-effective in SAN DIEGO, the tuition is cheap, the teachers are professional, academic rigorous and standardized, but it is very user-friendly. In addition to learning, there are many activities here to help students from all over the world understand and learn about culture and customs from all angles. It integrates entertainment and learning. If there are fees, it is also a discount for students, which is very cost-effective.

In short, Connect English language school gave me a very good learning experience, and I highly recommend this school.

(Original)
我在Connect English语言学校学习了二年多的时间， 我的英文从Level 2学至TOEFL班，顺利的申请到了我想去的大学。

这儿的学习我认为是SAN DIEGO性价比最高的，学费便宜，老师专业， 学术严谨规范，但又非常人性化。这儿除了学习外，还有很多的活动，帮助来自世界各地学生从各个角度了解和学习文化和习俗，集娱乐和学习于一体， 如有收费项目也是学生折扣价， 非常划算。

总之，Connect English语言学校给了我非常好的学习体验，我强烈推荐这个学校。<//review>< Rating>

After Greetings,,
I am the student, Fawaz, I acknowledge that Connect English
It is one of the best schools in the United States of America, as it is characterized by a distinguished staff of a high degree in terms of personal treatment and education. My feeling during the study period was not as though I was between my family, my brothers and my loved ones, and the development of the English language, I have evidence that they are very distinguished in their keenness to understand the information "different" ways. at the end ,,
I can only thank the teaching staff and my fellow students during the period I spent in Connect English, and I ask God for success and repayment.
Greetings
Fawaz

تحية طيبة وبعد،،
انا الطالب فواز  أقر بان Connect English
هي من افضل المدارس في الولايات المتحدة الأمريكية، حيث تتميز بطاقم مميز من الدرجة العالية من ناحية المعاملة الشخصية و التعليم. شعوري في فترة الدراسة كان ليس و كأني بين اهلي و اخوتي و احبتي، و تطور اللغة الانجليزية لدي دليل على انهم جداً متميزين في الحرص لإدراك المعلومة "ب شتان " الطرق. و في الختام ،،
لا يسعني الا اني اشكر الطاقم التدريس و اشكر اخواني و اخوتي الطلبه في الفترة التي قضيتها في Connect English ، و أسال الله التوفيق و السداد.

<rating>5</rating><text>(Translated by Google) I spent a year in San Diego and attended all three schools. The fastest job was fast and the staff in the office were reliable. The teachers were passionate and the class was good. Other Korean friends recommended it. It was very good to write only. The free conversation class is over and I have a chance to participate and talk to the other class if I want. Job ~! I think the level is higher than the advanced classes of other institutes but it is a good chance to try it. It was good. First time I recommend you leave the price is better than other institutes. I could not get information about this institute in Korea If you search for it, you will get it.

<text>(Translated by Google) My experience with Connect was great, I entered the TOEFL preparation and it really prepares you as if it were a pre-university entrance exam course, with tips and tricks to get the highest possible score on the test. The second part of the class, which did not involve TOEFL, and the lack of more computers and a WI-FI network at school left a little to be desired, but the experience was not hampered.

(Original)
Minha experiência com a Connect foi ótima, entrei no preparatório para o TOEFL e realmente ele te prepara como se fosse um cursinho pré-vestibular para a prova, com dicas e macetes para conseguir a maior nota possível no teste. A segunda parte da aula, que não envolvia o TOEFL, e a falta de mais computadores e uma rede WI-FI na escola deixaram um pouco a desejar, mas a experiência não foi prejudicada.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

(Translated by Google) This is a very good school. I started my studies here in December when my level of English was pre-intermediate. But in 5 months I improved my English level to Advanced. It all depends on you, how you work and whether you have an incentive to learn

That's a wonderful school. It was pre intermediate. But for 5 months, I improved my level of English to advanced. If you want a motivation to study, you can do it.

Это очень хорошая школа. Я начал свою обучение здесь в декабре когда мой уровень английского был pre-intermediate. Но за 5 месяцев улучшил свой уровень английского до уровня Advanced. Все зависит только от тебя , как ты занимаешься и есть ли у тебя стимул учиться

That's a wonderful school. I started my study in this school in December, when my level of English was pre intermediate. But for 5 month, I improved my level of English to advanced. Everithyng depends only on you, how you want to study, if you have a motivation to study , you can do it.</text>

(Translated by Google) The school is excellent! Interaction methodology and much learning. The teachers are all native speakers and there is a very strong focus on grammar. The conversation is good too, but nothing compared to going out on the streets and talking to natives. I recommend! The money is very good!

(Original)
A escola é excelente! Metodologia de interação e muito aprendizado. Os professores são todos nativos e há um foco muito grande quanto a gramática. A conversação também é boa, mas nada comparado ao sair nas ruas e conversar com nativos. Recomendo! O custo benefício é muito bom!<//text>

<text>(Translated by Google) I had a good experience at Connect English school. The teachers are well prepared and the textbooks are very good. The staff seems to be a bit clumsy and not always very present, but they all have a good positive energy that I enjoyed. The course is not very difficult so I think it's ideal for those who are starting out, but if you already know how to speak English well maybe you can look for something a little more challenging. My classmates who did not speak any English say the classes are very good. I paid for my entire course in Brazil so I did not have any problems, but some of my classmates pointed out that the school finances are very annoying as well. But overall the school is good, yes, there are not only Brazilian students and the teachers are American so I recommend yes.

(Original)
Eu tive uma experiência boa na escola Connect English. Os professores são bem preparados e os livros didáticos são muito bons. A equipe parece ser um pouco atrapalhada e nem sempre muito presente, mas todos possuem uma energia positiva boa que eu gostava. O curso não é muito difícil então eu acho ideal para quem está começando, mas se vc já sabe falar bem inglês talvez possa procurar algo um pouco mais desafiador. Meus colegas que não falavam nada de inglês dizem que as aulas inicias são muito boas. Eu paguei todo meu curso no Brasil então não tive problemas, mas alguns colegas da minha sala apontaram que o financeiro da escola costuma ser bem chato também. Mas no geral a escola é boa sim, não tem só alunos brasileiros e os professores são americanos então eu recomendo sim.</text><resp>None</resp>< rate>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I have been studying in Connect English for three months and have gained a lot. The school curriculum is completely different from the way we study in China. We focus on oral communication and focus on interest development. The daily curriculum is highly stressful and there is no time to be sleepy. There are English learners from all over the world. In the daily communication, not only improve their English, but also make friends, and strongly recommend it to everyone.

(Translated by Google) I studied at this school for 4 months, I am impressed. Very excellent teaching staff, personal attention to each student, if you need help, they are always ready to help Many thanks to Director Megan is very cool, they are called a teacher from birth. Special thanks to Jonathan who is very helpful, I was amazed that he remembers the students from the first day of his stay at school :). It turned out to be not so difficult to study with foreigners like me. The guys come from different countries, the classes are very fun and interesting. We manage to study, study the culture and traditions of other nations and spend leisure time together. There are many activities at the school so you won't be bored. Thank you to the school for the interesting time spent and the knowledge gained !!!! I'll miss you!!!

Я проучилась в этой школе 4 месяца, нахожусь под впечатлением. Очень отличный педагогический состав, персональное внимание каждому ученику, если нужна помощь всегда готовы помочь. Большое спасибо Директору Меган очень классная, таких называют учитель с рождения. Отдельное спасибо Джонатану очень отзывчивый , меня поразило что он запоминает учеников с первого дня пребывания в школе:). Учиться как оказалось не так и сложно с такими же иностранцами как я. Ребята собираются с разных стран , занятия проходят очень весело и интересно. Мы успеваем учиться , изучить культуру и традиции других народов и проходить вместе досуг. В школе проводится много мероприятий так что не придётся скучать.Спасибо школе за интересное проведённое время и полученные знания!!!! Буду скучать!!!< /review>

Connect English is the best and most affordable language school in San Diego. I left this school, where I studied English for about 1.5 years, to start a university program.

Except for Costco, this place has the best gasoline at the best price; bar none your best alternative if you don't have a membership in the latter. This particular station gets super busy and lines at the counter can turn irritating at times but definitely worth the wait if you need to save a few bucks.<//review>

I'm just tired of going there and there's always a long line because their to cheep to add another cash register so the people buying gas can go to the outside and people buying from the store use the inside register  ! Just makes sense after all these years  !! Plus the fact that they close up for shift change about 15 to 30 minutes sometimes !! I live here all my life and have been going there since the 70s and I am really considering to form a BOYCOTT of this place  !! They can do better as much money as they have made off the people of the community  !!!! GET IT TOGETHER  !! THIS IS SOON TO BE 2018 !!!!!< /Review>

<text>Awful layout. Crowded and very hard to maneuver. Multiple cars parked in front of pumps with no drivers and an empty convenience store. Had to ask the clerk twice to start the air and after she did, all it did was empty my tires. People speeding through the parking lot. Had to go to Costco for their great NO2 air station with a locking collar. Should've just waited in the long Costco line for gas to begin with.<//text>< pics>

Had the worse customer service experience, the cashier thought I didn’t hear her as she talked about me behind the window, simply because I needed to make sure what pump I was on, she went on the cuz at me, and say “omg hey out of here” and when asked her name she didn’t want to give it to me, it was a husky black gettoh female who is angry about her job most customers say she is rude, I think she gottah go.< /review>

Ordered for take out and I was definitely impressed with the portions! I've been at this bowl for a while now. I just keep adding more of the broth that was packaged separately and it keeps filling my plate up. The taste is definitely authentic. My new favorite place.< /Text>

This place has excellent Phó. So much flavor in the broth and they give you a really good amount of protein and noodles.  The service was very friendly and we didn't have to wait for them to take our order. I will be going back to try their other dishes and support this small business that isn't cheap with their product.<//Text>

Great food, excellent value.

I recommend the Birds Nest noodle dish.
I've been there 4 time now.
2 for take out and 2 for dine in.
Seems like its family owned and operated  give it a try.

UPDATE: I've been back more times than I care to admit I've been happy every single time.  They are always kind and ready to suggest items.  Special requests are always accommodated within reason.   I took my coworkers there for Xmas lunch and they all cleaned their plates.

Please go check it out.  Thanks.< /review>

<text>I have eaten in top rated fine dining restaurants as well as hole in the wall dives. I enjoy a wide range of ethnic foods. This was my second and LAST visit to this business. I really wanted to like it as I try to support small family businesses.
I ordered jasmine tea with dinner. It was concentrated (for their boba drinks). I told the young girl it was too strong and I could not drink it. She said "I'll  water it down". I watched as she poured half out and refilled with hot water. This is not how you make a pot of jasmine tea. Needless to say, I still could not drink it. I was not asked what else I wanted, nor offered anything else to drink besides my water.
BTW, I  only saw 2 young girls in the front of the restaurant and 1 of age man from the kitchen the whole time I was there. No experienced,  adults were present.
When my dinner arrived (the same dish I ordered the time before) it had a very foul odor. My instincts told me not to eat it. When asked if I needed anything, I told the young girl that there was something not right about the food. She just walked away. I finished my egg rolls and went to the desk to pay. When asked if everything was good, I said no, it wasn't and explained that there was something definitely wrong with the food. I told her that I would pay for what I had eaten, but not for the rest. She shrugged her shoulders and presented me with the full bill. I reiterated that there was something wrong with the ingredients and I did not feel safe eating the food. There was no apology nor adjustment to the bill. When I presented my debit/credit card, I was informed of the additional 50 cent service fee. Are you kidding me? Am I the only one that knows it is illegal to charge this fee on a debit card? I paid with cash instead. I was given a scripted "thank you" and told "see you again". "No, NO you won't!" I said in disbelief, "I will not be coming back". Then I hear another "Thank you". I turned around and said, "You're  thanking me for telling you I'm not coming back"? This was insane!</text>< Pics>

<Review>This place is great! They just opened and I have been in twice in 3 days. The taro smoothie is delicious, the bahn mi is so flavorful, and the sugarcane shrimp vermicelli was wonderful. It is at the top of my east county places to eat list!< /Review>< pictures>

After working in little Vietnam for years, I have tried many pho restaurants! I was excited and leary when Pho Tam and Grill arrived.... Such a weird location!!
We tried it and it's great!!! It's clean, authentic and very good quality!! We order P2... Pho with rare beef... Very good!
If heading south on Wintergardens, you have to flip a u to get into the little parking lot!</review>

My husband and I ordered our pho and egg rolls to-go. It was so delicious! They hooked us up too! They were so friendly and brought us water while we waited, no restaurant does that these days, especially in El Cajon. They made us feel like family. Pho Tam is now our favorite spot.</Text>

< review>
As a Vietnamese person who moved here from Mira Mesa, I was excited to see a new Vietnamese restaurant open in the area. There are a lot of authentic Vietnamese dishes here, besides pho which is nice to see. Highly recommended and stoked they're finally open! Their hours are 930a-9p, 7 days a week.

I have had their banh mi (Vietnamese sandwich) and I highly recommend the bbq pork. It's delicious and filling for less than $5. Their egg rolls are also nice and dense. The pho broth is good and doesn't taste watered down like some other places in the area. If you like a lot of meat in your pho, I'd suggest adding extra.

The customer service is fantastic. They made us feel very welcome and they're attentive to our questions and order customizations. I will definitely be coming here regularly.<//review>

< Review>
The name of the Guy is ( Martin ) He is so polite and so nice you will not expect it! Everything seems so good. I told him I had to go talk to my mom about the storage space. He said it was going to be $54 a month for a 8 x 5 storage space. I was walking out with my daughter and he said to me before you go I’ll give you a special $29 this month and $30 every month from now on but you have to get it now. I said well I need to go talk to my mom are you gonna be here tomorrow he said no I’m not gonna be here the whole week. So I went Looking for my mom but she was sleeping. So from $54-$29 I thought it was a good deal so I went back without my mom’s confirmation and told the guy I was going to do the deal. He started doing paperwork ask me for my debit card swiped it for  $44.12 sadly at that point I didn’t see the amount he charged me. So he first charge my debit card and then gave me the form and said sign here while I was reading the form I told him why is it saying $44.12 he said just sign that one and I’ll explain everything right now . He said don’t tell anybody that I’m giving you this deal. So by then I already had signed the form I was trusting him. Then once he seen I had already sing the form he tells me it’s going to be $39 a month and if you’re late one time it’s going to go back up to $54 a month he started being super straight up and not the person I was dealing with at the beginning my daughter was there to prove that I am not lying I felt so mad that this guy had played me so hard. I looked into his eyes and I told him you lied to me you made me sign and charge my card and you lied in my face he kept saying I didn’t lie I never said it was $29 a month he said I said $39! So at the end I was really disappointed because I already had paid and signed that form. I walked out I asked my daughter did you hear when he said 29 to start and $30 a month from now my daughter said he has I heard him I’m so disappointed in this please.< /Review>

Excellent customer service by Rainey. She was very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly.....not the type of customer service you typically get from places like this but I was very pleased with her customer service attitude. I appreciate the quick and informative way she handled my whole storage rental process from beginning to end. Left feeling very satisfied. Thanks Rainey.</text>

<Response>{'time': 1515007100451, 'text': "Hi David,\n\nAt Arlington Self Storage, we value the security of our tenants and their belongings, and therefore, we have a strict security policy in place. In order to amend or update a lease, the primary tenant does have to be physically present in order to provide written consent for any changes to their account. Unfortunately, since your aunt is hospitalized, there is nothing we can do in this regard.\n\nIt does appear that your relative is authorized for access to your aunt's account, however, we were unable to assist you in the event that you do not have a key to the lock. We were able to provide you with a gate code, and after finding your key, you were indeed granted access our property and your aunt's storage unit.\n\nUpon further review of this complaint, it was revealed that an incident report was filed against your relative on New Year's Eve. Apparently, after our Property Manager, Rainie, had kindly warned your party of an early property closure due to the holiday, your relative had nearly gotten into an unprovoked physical altercation with her. This lead to the police being called to the property and was a clear violation of our rules and regulations. As mentioned earlier, security is of utmost importance. This kind of conduct is not tolerated and we reserve the right to revoke access to any tenant or guest. If you are capable of behaving within the provisions of our rules and regulations, then you are more than welcome onto our property.\n\nThank you for your understanding,\nManagement"}<//Response>< name>

< review>
I have read so many reviews here stating what great customer service they have , not true in my case, it was terrible, especially from a ms. Rainey. After posting a past due payment for my aunt that wound up in the hospital from a heartattack, we were not given access to my aunts unit so that we may remove her belongings before the next months payment. Ms. Rainey never updated the notes on the account to allow us access. She was all to happy to take our money but did little else to make this an easier process. She even had the nerve to suggest that we go to the hospital and take a selfie with my aunt giving a thumbs up. They also asked to speak to her,  even tho we told them she could not because she has a trache in her throat. After having the woman at the counter get ms. Rainey on the phone, she said she would not change anything on the account, and that we need to come back tomorrow and when she is in the office. After explaining that my mother was made executive to my aunts estate when she was admitted to the hospital the woman at the counter said she would talk to their lawyers and see what they have to say. Well after waiting in the parking lot for 20 minutes with an angry mother the woman at the counter came out and said they would give us access if we had a key to the unit which we did. Overall a terrible experience , the woman at the counter was helpful but ms. Rainey needs to work on her customer service.
P.S. , I don't know what they have going on at this facility but there seems to be a lot of people hanging out at the facility. I mean they weren't loading or unloading anything, they seem to loiter and do repairs to cars in the middle of the aisles. I even witnessed one of these people bring in 2 cartons of eggnog and asked that the woman at the counter store it for him in the refrigerator, then go into the bathroom with two other people, I'm  going to take a wild guess and suggest they are homeless and probably live in their unit, and it seems to be permitted by this facility. I will be calling corporate and filing a complaint .</review>

UPDATE!!!
One negative is access closes too early on Sunday’s and holidays...Customer Service is not the issue, that is good.....BUT,  after being their Customer since 2017, I'll be ending the relationship by the end of month. One of the two reasons is the excessive price increases since then. $30 dollar increase in less than 3 years. You'd think after leasing a year or two, you would get a break...NO... they break you all right....BEWARE....DO not be late. I've been late 2 times and the most recent late fee was $55.00. They added a $20 lock out fee(paid on 29th,) but I called a week ahead and said I'd be late on a $203.00 monthly rent (I forgot about them adding fee, they didn't mention)mind you, in almost 36 months I was late 2 times...that's it....they will do one courtesy wave.but they increased their late fee...I also rent another 10x20 from Store America in SB. They do not charge the excessive fee that this Arlington location does. Plus I get Military discount at the Berdoo one, not at the Arlington one...Now, they should have free donuts on Mondays like the one in NorthBerdoo!

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I'm very pleased with the customer service, Ranie is very professional and knowledgeable. I've been here for a few months now and the times I've come into the office to make a payment she has been friendly and takes the time to remember everyone's names and she brings positive energey, I recomemed this facility for its cleanliness and friendly staff, i feel i can trust my belongings here as well.The move in process is quick and painless, she is very throrough and explains everything in great detail. She is the perfect person to go to in need of a storage whether you lost your house, going through a divorce, or simply just trying to get your house in order, she always has a smile and works very hard. I hope my review helps you chose a place you are happy with. Not to mention, they have a move in special of $29.99 for the first month.< /review>< pictures>

<userid>103276620708855291095< /userid><text>Kept my dogs here for the weekend. Didn't take pictures but they are kept outside in covered fenced cages that are just connected to each other in huge groups that are built over a dirt field.

Why isn't that on the lovely pictures that are posted for this place 🤔

My dogs stunk and desperately needed a bath when we brought them home because of the environment they were kept in.
My dogs are inside dogs so I felt bad for them.I didn't drop them off so I didn't know until I picked them up.
I've never used a pet boarding place before but I guess this is normal 🤷‍♂️

Here's a picture I found online that looks similar to what I saw. Just imagine isles and isles of these and they are all connected. Dog comfort was not intended when this place was built.
My dogs were still alive so ill give 2 stars<//text>< Name>

<Text>This is a great place to leave your pets if you want them to have loving and caring hands while you're away. They make sure the resort kennels are cleaned daily and all the employees there love your babies as well!! They do all that they can to make sure your pets are very well taken care of. They make sure to call me with every problem my baby may be giving them and discuss other options that may be better for him. He rubbed his paws raw trying to get out of his kennel and also hurt his mouth tugging the fence. Eventually we figured out what worked for my poor baby, who was only distressed from experiencing life in a kennel for the first time, and most likely will start to show distress when he is there for a longer period of time, but I have the upmost confidence that they will take great care of my baby and make sure he comes home safe and healthy! I love Cowen's Pet Resort and I highly recommend you bring your pets here for professional and loving care for your babies! Thank you everyone at Cowen's Pet Resort, for making my baby as comfortable as possible during my away trip. I look forward to bringing little Louie there for all future trips he can't be a part of.</Text>< GmapID>

<Text>This was our first time leaving our dogs anywhere. We gave Cowen's pet resort a try and I have to say we loved it! Our pets came back home happy! Both our dogs would cry when we would put them in the car to take them anywhere and bark at any dog and anyone passing by. Since we left them there the whole way back home they both layed down on the back without making any noise. We were so surprised! There is a difference in our dogs and its a good difference. Thats a definite that we will be using them in the future.<//Text><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

I searched for months for a place I felt comfortable leaving my k9 companion. Everyone seemed very caring & assured me my dog would be happy there &  treated well with the best of care. My dog is my emotional support dog & even though it was very difficult leaving him I am so happy I chose Cowen's. They communicated with me with updates & photos through texts on a regular basis. Everyone took great care of him  & he made many friends there. He was happy &  in great condition when I picked him up!!! I recommend Cowen's Pet Resort to everyone😊< /text>

<text>Great service.  They took care of my two dogs; one who does not like strangers, so I was concerned as to how well the staff would be able to care for him. To my surprise, they were able make friends with him and he was well cared-for. The staff is very passionate about what they do and their actions show it.  The kennels are clean, large and well-kept. I have no problem leaving my dogs with them again.</text><Resp>None<//Resp></record></dataset><record>

My two small dogs have stayed twice for several days.  They were kept in the same kennel at our request and were well taken care of.  We brought our own dog food that they were used to eating. Our dogs, naturally, were very happy to see us, healthy and suffered no ill effects from being boarded.  Staff seemed very friendly and caring towards us and our pets.  Will use again.< /text>

We've been using Cowen's for about ten years now and our dog loves it. She gets excited as we pull in the driveway and can hardly wait to get into the office! We always hear good things about her when we come back and can tell that they've been attentive to her needs. I met a lady who used to work there once and when I mentioned what my dog would do she said that she would often see that kind of reaction. She said the pets love it there and the staff really loves animals.< /review>

I take my dogs here every time I leave town and they do a good job looking after them. My dogs are excited to go there which I see as a good sign and clearly like the staff. The prices are good and I've never had a problem. I take my dogs about once per month on average. I recommend to friends.

A lot of reviews are decrying the grooming - I don't get my dogs groomed here. I typically bathe them after a stay. It is an outdoor kennel after all, and dogs smell after being outside. They have coverage from the sun for shade and misters, and there are houses to insulate if it's cold.< /text>

We have been bringing our cavaliers to Cowens since we got our first one 13 years ago. The staff has always taken great care of our fur babies and they have always been happy and well taken care of. We always have them bathed and they do a great job making them look and smell clean. The staff even made a point of calling us one time when our dog was not eating and even made her special food to get her to eat. It’s so nice to know my dogs are in good hands when we regretfully have to leave them.</Review>

Our two German Shepherd Dogs, Apollo and Athena, seemed to have enjoyed their stay. After the dogs gave us an excited 3 minute greeting when we picked them up, they seemed tired out and relaxed on the ride home and appear to be very healthy. Everyone we talked to there was really friendly and seemed like genuine animal lovers - the lady outside even took pictures of the dogs when they were playing and posted to Facebook.<//review>

My husband picked up our dog Max today from a 3 night stay. Max was filthy, smelled awful, and starving. Between all of his toes on both the front and back legs is raw. His paws were completely swollen and he wouldn't stop licking them. His face is red and swollen where a muzzle would go. Cowens boosts about their pet grooming, but I think whoever attempted to groom him caused him harm. I'm terribly disappointed and cannot understand how this could happen. Our dog is loving and cooperative and should not have been returned to us this way. I hope others read this and understand that not everyone is going to care for your pets. We will not be taking our dog back. Max doesn't shed much, but after bringing him home, his fur is almost falling out. I have taken pictures of all of these things and wish I knew how to upload them< /text>

This kennel used to have great service. These last two times I've taken my dog I've picked him up smelling awful! If they just "bathed and groomed" him then why is he stinky and looks dirty? Their solution was to spritz him with scented spray! The second thing I didn't like is that he was also really really thirsty. I'm sure I wont take my pet here anymore.<//text>

The kennels are large enough for big dogs and they offer a variety of treats you can purchase for your fur baby at a reasonable price.  Just wish they were open longer hours,< /review>

The staff were very friendly and concern about your pets. My 2 dogs buddy and missy never have stayed at a pet resort. They must of like it cuz buddy slipped out of his collar and ran back to the girls when we were trying to put them in the truck! So they will be staying there when I go out of town again thank you.😀 I will refer you to my friends and family!!</review>

<Text>Dogs were a bit stinky, but so happy to come home. They were spoiled and accommodated. One of my dogs is a big o’ chicken and the pair of dogs were moved to be less bothered.<//Text>< Rating>

<text>I absolutely love this place!! It’s like a diamond in the rough. Coming from another place in CV, which had such terrible service, this is a crafters heaven. They help you right away and owners are so nice! They have all the ribbon colors you need and assist you right when you need it. They have tons of flowers and wedding decorations. They now have a regular customer!! There’s no other place to go but here on this area, trust me.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I live in Mission Viejo. I went to visit my friend in Chula Vista and we went to this store La Bonita together. My friend told me she is a regular to this store because the owner is so nice and helpful and also they have such a huge selection of silk flowers so I decided to stop by. First of all, I loved their store sign. One of their letter was a flower and it was just so cute! When I walked into the store, I was so surprised because they have so many different kinds of products. Very colorful silk flowers, baby shower supplies, wedding supplies, gifts and more! The price was so reasonable and affordable. Like my friend told me the owner lady was so helpful and friendly. I wish I live closer so I can go there more often. I'm sure I will visit again soon though because my daughter's birthday is coming soon. So excited to go back!!!<//Review>

< Review>
They have many plants and flowers at very good prices. The new place they move to is very nice and a lot more room. They make my life easier and when I order items they come in on time. Keep it up...</Review>

Terrible experience with the owner of the store, she has a terrible attitude..!! Like she is mad at everybody that comes inside her store.. Including her poor employer, that poor lady couldn't even talk because she looks like afraid of her. I use to buy a lot of merchandise from that store all the time before because it was another person in charge of it, and it was always really gracious with the clients. Since the new owner is there it's always been a struggle to buy from her. She even makes you think like she is making you a favor to sell you.
She was rude, disrespectful and in top of that when I ask her why was she so rude? She said I wasn't.
I didn't do anything to you... I ask her a question and she answer upset and she even said, if you like it ... If not don't buy it...
I told her you are disrespectful and rude.. And I don't want anything from you anymore. I was your client from many years but with that attitude I will never buy anything here anymore.
Her answer was...
You are not welcome in my store...
Leave my store..!!!<//text>

$8 to hem up some jeans. Cash only. I had five pants, $40 in cash exactly is what I paid. Liquor store across the street is the nearest ATM. Dropped off around 2PM on a Monday, picked up on midday Wednesday. I shopped around the area and was quoted $12 - $15 (each) for the same work. I'm happy, sure saved me some time.< /Text>

If I could post zero stars I would. I usually don't post negative reviews but when a business owner is dishonest I think people deserve to know. I came to Le's to get a dress altered on Thursday and asked when will it be ready by and he answered early next week. I told him can it be early Monday because i'm flying back home and he said okay that works and even circled Monday on the paper receipt. Monday comes and I drive all the way back and the store is closed! I then send my sister today to go and explain the situation and then mail the dress to me (more money out of my pocket) and he claims that he said it'll be ready Saturday but because I wanted it to be Monday he circled Monday. My sister told him why would you circle Monday and tell her okay Monday when you were going to be closed? He said because I was following her request she didn't want Saturday (which is a bold faced lie). I'm completely shocked by the blatant dishonesty and will never come back here again. STAY AWAY!<//text>

<text>I've been using Le's for years, and have always been happy. He is the best tailor I've come across - quality work, fast service, and reasonable prices. I've had them hem pants to fully alter suits. My wife even had him make alterations to her wedding dress when we got married several years ago. I can't recommend Le enough!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

Hemmed a long sleeve on a dress for me in under 10 minutes! Very courteous, understood what I wanted, and accurate. The customer after me came in having called the day before about an alteration. He remembered her name and what she wanted from their previous conversation. Wish I had a guy like him in my neighborhood back home!< /Review>

I payed then $25 for that. And they guy just insisted that he did everything right.
The length was right OK, but shirts are different, this one is slim, you can't just cut off all without leaving some extra space. Even I understand that and I'm far from being a tailor.
I showed right in front of them that I can't even raise up my arms all the way up. And they still insisted that everything is fine. All I could get from them is at least adjust buttons on sleeves.

And by the way, No "hello", no "how are you", no "thank you for coming" you won't hear anything like that here.
They take only cash or check. Once you gave them yellow receipt and received your clothes you don't have much paperwork proving that they took money
I honestly cannot recommend the place<//Text>< pics>

<rate>1</rate><review>I brought in 2 girls pants and paid $30 dollars together to adjust the waist width from 27" to 25.5". I dropped off on Wed. and was told they would be ready on Friday. I went there on Friday to pick up the "done" pants and found out the waist width was still 27". Then I asked to them to adjust the pants again, paid $30 and they said to pick up on Sat.  I went there the third time on Mon. to pick up the "done" pants and found out the waist size was still 27". So it takes me 3 trip and $30 for not-touched pants. This is the most dishonest alternation store I have ever been. If anybody want to do alternation at this shop, bring the measure tape and take notes so the shop won't just take your money and do nothing. This is a cash, check only shop.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmap_id>0x808fb0d2c6c76895:0x566b0a926e2e2763<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) We needed to do an outlet in suit pants in a hurry, the lady did it to us in 5 minutes. Very neat work and low price!

Wearing helmets is also a law in the state of California that we are required to enforce. We understand that this doesn’t suit everyone’s desires in a skatepark but the community we serve is very happy with what we provide to help keep a fun, family-friendly facility where kids will be safe. In time we expect to update and add new features to the skatepark, we hope that you might come out and give us a second chance :)'}<//resp>

If your going on a trip. THIS IS NOT THE PLACE TO GO. The park wasn’t even really that good either. There are way better parks that you can get into for free. I would rather skate a parking lot.

This place is amazing for skaters at all levels. Whether you want to learn how to skate vert or street there is definitely enough spots to work on your technique here. As for the staff David and his team are dope, super cool and informed. I continue to skate here and bring my friends who've never skated before too because everyone is here to have a good time and skate</Text>

I cannot say enough good things about this Skate Park. We love that the skate park is gated, clean and monitored by employees.  The manager Dave is awesome, anytime I have an issue or concern he handles it immediately. Nice to have you back Fontana North.</Text>

This is a very nice skatepark! I've been taking my 2 boys here for a about a month and have been very happy with the whole experience and environment. They have a lot of cool things to skate or ride your bike on and do tricks.  There are a couple of pools, rails, etc.

This place is well taken care of and has good lighting at night. The guys that work in the skate store are nice and friendly too. Check this place out, you'll be glad you did.<//review>

The park looks very clean they have restrooms close to the entrance the only bad thing you have to pay to get in we came here because we thought it was a free city park. Other than that looks good right on the other side is a flat green area to walk or exercise or even ride the scooters</Review>

This is a great skate park. It's huge with a couple pools , and everything you need to have a great skating experience. It's well-kept up , relatively inexpensive , and even has a small skate shop. I haven't been to too many skateparks but out of all the ones I have been to this is the best one. There is a small fee to skate I think it's like 3 to $5.</text>

<Rate>1<//Rate><text>Bad brake job and didn't care to fix it. Literally told me drive unsafe because he had no staff to even do the job when I brought my car...all the guy did was shrug his shoulders when I asked why he wasn't honoring the warranty. Never going back to that overpriced place. I went across the street where they were honest and caring.<//text>< Pictures>

<review>I go out of my way to bring my jeep to this particular pep boys for repair & maintenance. The mechanics at this location are second to none. They seem to be much better and knowledgeable than most garages anywhere. True masters of the trade. They also work with you to get you the best possible deal so you won't be overcharged. Friendly & professional. I highly recommend this location for car repair.< /review>< Pictures>

Friendly staff! Very helpful. The 3 stars are simply because my hubby was the customer not me. Lol I had to go up there because he needed a tool that they didn't have.</review>

Pep Boys has always been a favorite. Customer service is their priority. The young associate at the register was very helpful 👌🏽</review>

<date>1613358756507</date><rate>1<//rate><text>You guys owe me some money!!!! For one, i got an alignment done here and my car was still pulling to the right, and i know that it's not just an isolated incident as my mom was having the same issue after getting her alignment done here too. On friday night, i got a flat tire and i assumed it was a nail. I filled it up and drove to america's tires to get it repaired and upon removing the tire it was discovered that the tire had excessive wear on the inner portion but there was no nail. due to the fact that wire had been exposed on the front drivers side tire, the advisor informed me that he can do nothing about it due to safety reasons and that the air more than likely was leaking from the area that the wire was expsed from. I decided to go ahead and replace the fronts and the technician recommended i get an alignment done and obviously i just did from pep boys in upland. The tires were brand new and had less than 7k miles on them so it's not an issue of old tires. Pep boys can't work on cars if their lives depended on it. I had rescheduled an alignment for this tuesday but never mind, you guys can go ahead and cancel it. Lost my trust completely and i will just have an actual experienced technician do the work for half the price. I would like to speak to someone in charge at the upland pep boys or i will be contacting corporate regarding the issue and i will get my money back for the alignment as well as the money i had to spend for the tires, one way or another!<//text>< pics>

Whoever the young manager here is he is doing an amazing job running this place. He reallt cares about his customers. He showed me tremendous respect when I came to drop off some oil the other day to be recycled. I want people to know that Attitude is Everything! Good Job!<//Review>

Always awesome service and reasonable price. Keep it up!

EDIT TO ADD: Pep Boys Upland has been my go-to place ever since the warranty on my vehicle expired. I'm back here again (still in the parking lot) because I received another excellent service from this store and its staff. I've been happy with bringing my car to them for whatever reason. Again: keep it up!</Text>

<Review>The people that work here are great. Sam, who works in the service department is very helpful and works with you on a personal level to help you with whatever you and your car needs. The guy even helped me when I had a dang seizure right in front of him ha. If you're reading this then thanks again for that Sam. Ignacio the manager is also helpful, the guy even answers phones when everyone else is busy. He also makes sure that pricing is fair and that the work is completed on time and done correctly and safely. The work is guaranteed for a few months (don't quote me on that) and some of the parts are guaranteed for the lifetime of the vehicle. This Pep Boys is better than most other Pep Boys that I have been to.</Review>< date>

Been here a several times for tire maintenance and oil changes, and the service is excellent! 1st time I had took my car to another shop to get a flat repair and they told me I would need a new tire. Took to this Pep Boys and they fixed it for $10. Today I did an oil change and another flat repair. 4 hours later the tire that was repaired was flat again. Took it back 10 minutes before closing and they re-checked it. Turns out there was a second nail they missed or I have the worst luck and managed to drive over a nail on the tire I just got fixed (I wouldn't doubt it). Regardless they patched that hole up free of charge even though it was past closing and they had to stay a bit longer to do it. Best place I've been to in a long time and will definitely be bringing my vehicle here as long as I live in the area. Thanks again Anthony!

On a side note: If you can, be sure to call and setup an appointment as they can get pretty busy at times and you can avoid having to wait hours or coming back at a later time.</Text>

< Review>
Our windshield wipers suddenly stopped working on a very rainy day, so we came in and Miguel and Ruben with the Service Desk were a big help.
We already knew the motor was trying to work, but something came loose and Miguel fixed the problem really quickly. We were so relieved to get back on the road.< /Review>

I have been bringing my vehicle to this Pep boys for about 2 years now. They are always polite, usually on time with repairs and a lot of the parts and labor are guaranteed for the life of the vehicle. Not bad at all. Sam in the service department is very helpful and can answer all of your questions.< /Text>

With all the rain it was time to replace the windshield wipers. They had several on sale and the person recommended a brand based on price to value. That was nice. As I was paying for the wipers another person walked outside and installed them on my car. That was cool!<//review>

The Upland Pep Boys for a reasonable price repaired work that was previously done incompetantly by another company. The other establishment also recommended $800 worth of work which wasn't needed. Thank you for being honest, friendly and professional. You have earned a new customer.<//Text>

<review>Usually not the type to leave reviews but have to leave a 5 star rating for what it's worth. I got a flat tire at night and unfortunately most tire shops close fairly early in the day. Pep Boys was the only place open, I knew it was a long shot but I called anyway, an hour til closing. Told the person on the phone my predicament and they said to come in. I was in and out in with a new tire in about 25 minutes, exactly as quoted. Price for a new tire wasn't cheap, but not unfair. They do get really busy at times so i may have just got lucky but every experience I've had here has been a good one. Nice hardworking people who really saved me from a massive headache. Thanks guys<//review>< pics>

Sent my daughter for a brake check they tell her she needs $265 worth of brakes rotors pads fluid! She just had them all replaced less then 10,000 miles ago! I got two different responses from “so called” mechanics, she sent pics and in turn I sent them to my mechanic and he said she had plenty of pads left and her rotors were fine! Hmmmmm here is what I see a 22 yr old female that has no clue about cars almost got took! Not a place I would suggest you go to have your car fixed! Honesty people try it you will like it! Up-sale is the bottom line!< /text>

I brought it here for the first time because I desparately needed a quick oil change, now its the only place I will go. Everyone I have encountered there is so helpful. I was worried I would ended up pay more than I would expect and every time I end up paying less and they always throw in little extras that aren't big hassles but save time and money for me. They are the my regular maintenance stop every time.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Then they fixed the problem but now i had a new problem with the engine fluid leaking out(which was not the problem in 1st place). Such a bad experience and to top it off i had it towed back to the store to get a radiator cap replaced. I wouldn't recommend them to anyone. The only reason why they are getting any stars at all is because they know they messed up big time and gave me a cheaper price on my total.<//text><gmapID>0x80c3314c774b00c3:0x3d1ab937d58ec85a< /gmapID><userid>113629317912851048274< /userid><Response>None<//Response>< name>

Girl at the desk doesn't know what she's talking about. (5' 10" blonde) and has to ask a technician about my problem. Brought my car in for two hoses. Apparently they have to do a 140 dollar smog check even though I've got a check list of my smog from less than ten minutes ago. I also told them what the problem is. Instead of just fixing the hoses they need to do a "failed smog check" for a 140 dollars? That makes no sense to me what so ever.

I would understand if I came in saying I don't know what's wrong and it won't pass smog, but that's not the case. I went in with an identified issue and they need to pull some crap like that. Last time I go there.</Text>

I made an appointment online at 2pm for 4pm, walked in the store around 4pm and didn't see any other customers in the store. I proceeded to fill out the paperwork with the employee and gave him my key, then went to sit in the empty waiting area. Almost an hour later he comes to tell me hes almost finished and a nail is in my tire (it had been losing air so that explains a lot, but that's for another day). Another 30 minutes go by and he's FINALLY finished! Why bother making an appointment if I have to wait an hour and a half with no line?! I might as well have just done it myself for an extra $5 or $10.< /text>

<review>I bought tires from Pep Boys about a year ago, so brought my truck into the Upland shop to have the tires rotated because they were starting to show uneven wear and I was leaving on a driving vacation in two days. I also had a slow leak I wanted repaired.

The guy behind the counter said that there’d be no charge, even though I offered to pay. I left my truck there for the day and picked it up close to closing later that evening.

I didn’t drive it much, only locally, until I left for vacation. I found that, after a few freeway miles, that there was something seriously wrong with the truck’s ride.

I pulled into a tire shop in Needles, CA and told the owner/tech there about the symptoms. The truck was vibrating so badly that the dashboard looked like it was going to fall off.

He removed and balanced and replaced each tire. He found that a) the tires had not been rotated and b) the tires had been balanced incorrectly. Weights had been put on the complete opposite side of the imbalance, or on the inside of the tire instead of the outside. In one instance 5 ounces of weights had been added to balance out 5.5 ounces of weight, where only .5 ounces were necessary.

I gladly paid the man $50 for the work he performed and then got back on the freeway with a smooth and perfect ride.

Later I went back to Pep Boys Upland to talk about the lousy service. The same guy was behind the counter, and first he implied that I was lying, then that the Needles tech was lying, then he said that the shops tire-balancing machine was old and defective, then he said that the tech who performed the work was new and inexperienced. He promised that the service manager would call me, but he never did.

My past experience with Pep Boys: an oil change where the tech left the dented filter on after failing to get it off; an air conditioning recharge that resulted in the air compressor filling with oil (and a $900 bill to get it repaired); the Pep boys tech replacing a single wheel bearing instead of universal joints (when I’d brought it in and gave a general description.)

So the poor rating I give here isn’t really for Pep Boys… it’s for me, for trusting Pep Boys to perform repairs and quality control, again and again, on vehicles I depend on.</review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Bought tires online, paid for them. This location would not honor the price - said "our computer does not say the same" receipt in hand and had to walk out the door. They could care less about the customer. Had to reverse the charge on my credit card. I believe this is illegal.<//Review>

<text>Took my Acura for the normal oil change a few months ago and I loved the service.  But two weeks it was a different manager and I was dissatisfied with it this time.  I check the oil and is not clear like it's supposed to be and in wonder if they put the synthetic 5-20 my car demands and I told them to make sure they did.  My tires were not rotated and that was supposed to be part of the service.  I need brakes and they didn't even tell me, oh and I can check the tire pressure on the dash-- so they didn't do the service.  I know they didn't give me a new oil filter for the oil is dirty and it's been a couple of weeks. It looks new but it should be crystal clear.  The manager said my struts leaked all the oils and I need new ones.  My car was so friking smooth and I never felt any weird movement on the from when going over bumps ( no weird noises or knocking).  First time it was a Caucasian manager- no complaints.   2nd time it was a Hispanic manager-  horrible experience and I don't even know if they messed up my struts.  I'm only saying this so Pep Boys can identified the individual. In Hispanic and yes I can talked sh..tuff.  please.dont feel offended about race but rather about the integrity of individuals.  I'm not going back there anymore.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Went in for A/C leak, they checked and found nothing. Supposedly the replaced new valves. Went to another small place and found the problem right away and found out that the valves were broken. Do pep boy actually know that their mechanics SUCK big time? Not recommended at all. I fell very disappointed :(.<//Text>

<review>I would like to thank pep boys for their wonderful service today, helped me try to figure out why I had some rattiling in my engine bay. Took the time to explain it and gave me a price.

I would expecially like to thank Ruban, Tony, and one other tech whos name I didnt catch, for the help!<//review><user>105793510121073623092< /user>< time>

I am extramely leary of this location after this experience with them.  I will not return to this PepBoys EVER !!!!   i still believe i should get a refund on the amount of Labor they charged me for this.  its not my fault that guy broke a bolt that was totally avoidable.  pffft !!!< /text></record>

I asked for the right window shade for a 2007 Avalon a man at the counter gave me a sunshade for my car I got home and it's way too small. I would not say anything but I am not that close to them and now I have to return the damn thing.</Text>

I called the day before to get a alignment. they said for me to come in at 8am the next day so i did. when i walked in there ready for it, they said the 'guy' that does the alignment wont be in til 11am. i was surprised because i told them i set a appt. for 8am today, and he didnt even care. just looked at me like he has better things to do at 8am and just told me he wont be in til 11am even though i sat a appt. with them. i told them i didnt wake up for 8am for nothing and i walked out. i ended up going across the street at a shop and got the alignment done there..

dont go here..they dont care at all. waste of time to everyone</Text>

I first used JW to get a second opinion when I thought a different plumber was screwing me. Turns out, the different plumber was screwing me. So now I’m back with JW to do a major repair, and I am delighted. My home sits on a concrete slab, so jackhammering was required to replace a pipe. It was important to me that they try to not touch my new chevron hardwood floors, and they went completely through a closet floor and wall, and left the floor is perfectly intact. The main plumber over seeing the job was Paul, and he’s great.< /Review>

<review>David the technician was very friendly and knowledgeable. I auto pay $180 yearly for JW maintenance fee so I didn’t have to pay additional for the maintenance. He did find the 40 microfarad capacitor was only reading at 34 so highly recommended replacing it. I felt the install was initially a bit pricey at $187 but was over a good call to replace it since the unit is only 8 years old and parts are still under warranty for two more years. David said if it wasn’t under warranty, just a new capacitor part could costs about $400.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

They were very quick to get someone out to assess our sewer pipe.  When Paul arrived, he was incredibly friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.    He and his team reviewed the situation and gave a great recommendation on how to proceed.   While it’s hard to actually go underground and see the work done, Paul did show me the camera videos (live) after the work was complete.   When the team finished filling the hole they’d created, we did have a small problem with the access pipe sticking out too far.  But Paul responded quickly and came the next day to resolve it.  Prices aren’t for the faint of heart, but it should pay off in the long run.  And Paul was great to work with.</Text>

The service technician showed up at my house and within 15 minutes explain to me that I needed a brand new $11,000 unit craned up onto my roof. I told him I could not afford it and that I would just pay for the repair. They charged me $2400 for a repair and it did absolutely nothing. When I complain to the company they did nothing about it. At my own expense I paid to have another smaller air-conditioning company to come in and for $2200 they completely fixed my unit and it is working perfectly to this day. I will never bother going to a large company again as all they want to do is sell new units.< /text>

Paul came out and was able to efficiently and expediently address the shower leak that I’ve had for a couple months now. He was able to walk me through what was causing the leak as well as to the remedy. Was very happy with the work (as well as the prices) and will be using JW Heating & Air in the future as well.<//text>

JW Heat and Air called to see if I wanted to schedule an appointment to have my HVAC cleaned and inspected. I declined but asked if they also do plumbing as I had a couple issues. She said yes and scheduled an appointment. Paul came out and quickly diagnosed the problem with my toilet , replaced parts and also looked at my sink that sometimes backs up.  I declined the sink repair as it only happened periodically, until this morning when I woke to water pouring from my sink onto my bedroom floor. I cleaned it up and called JW. Paul came this afternoon and cleared my clogged sink in record time. I was so impressed with his promptness, friendly demeanor and knowledge. He wore a mask and shoe protectors. I highly recommend JW and if you get Paul you’re in luck! Thanks again Paul!.</text>

<review>I highly recommend JW Plumbing and Heating.  Paul, the project manager explained what was wrong with my sewer line and what my options were. There was no hard sell involved and no charge for the initial evaluation. Once I made my decision, Paul stayed onsite to ensure the work was properly executed. This company is very professional. All work was completed in the quoted timeframe and they cleaned up the yard before leaving.  Going forward, I am pleased to have a honest, professional company I can confidently call on for heating and plumbing services.<//review><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1< /Gmap_id></record>

They were extremely friendly and communicative. They completed the cleaning faster than their estimated time. Both of the technicians were deliberate about wearing a mask and wearing booties when coming into our house. They put a drop cloth down and cleaned up after themselves. They could not have been more professional.< /review>

Our shower drain was clogged and was causing water to backup into our bathtub and toilet. We also had a separate issue with a leak under our kitchen sink. Paul got the shower drain unclogged quickly and we haven’t had any issues since. He diagnosed two issues with our kitchen sink, and we ended up installing a new basket strainer and faucet. We decided to purchase the faucet ourselves so he had to come back for a separate visit to install that. In the process of installing it, we had an issue with our countertop that had to be addressed first so we again had to delay him and have him come back for a third visit. All went well the last time and we are grateful that he took the time to address our needs and never charged more than the initial quote. Highly recommend working with him!<//Text>

<Text>We just spent $1500 for them to clean out our HVAC and replace filters.  They left without reconnecting the system and it’s inoperable.  When I called them, their operator said they had gone home for the day (4:30pm) and there was no way to get anyone out until the next day.  We have  a long history with JW since the dual zone HVAC they installed for us 3 years ago crashes periodically and shuts down the downstairs HVAC.  They’ve always been nice, but incomplete work (see above) and a delay in getting them to come back and fix their mistake has been a regular problem with them.  I think at this point we’re just done with them.<//Text>< Pics>

This is the 3rd company that I had to come out and look at the heater and the only one of the 3 who actually took the time to seek out any problems and the only one who was willing to listen and answer questions. So glad I found JW and we will definitely have them take care of our maintenance from here on out.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

My heater thermostat blew out and MARCO came over from JW to fix it!  He explained exactly what was wrong with it and installed a new digital one which works great.  Additionally, there was a weird bypass that a previous owner did on the heater that Marco fixed and explained.  I was very happy with his service - very professional and knowledgeable!   He even explained additional heating/ac options for my home.  Thank you Marco!<//Text>

<Review>JW Heating and Air did an outstanding job of servicing my central heating and air system.

Gerardo and Christopher were our amazing service technicians. They would have received 10 stars but there were only 5.  They were polite, engaging, efficient, competent and knowledgeable and did an outstanding job!  They did not rush and took the time to explain what was going on with each of our units.  They observed COVID protocols while in our home which gave us great comfort.  Gerardo even remembered being at our home for our last service and recalled details about our units.  Needless to say, we were impressed.  We now have a maintenance plan with JW and my husband and I look forward to many years of utilizing their services.  I highly recommend JW Plumbing and heating without reservation. Angela & Mike</Text>

Benny was great! We just moved into a new home and the units were installed improperly, Benny fixed what was possible and very patiently walked me through every single question I had. I’m extremely grateful for all of his help. Monica with scheduling went out of her way to accommodate my schedule. I’d definitely use this company again!</Text>

My 4 year old HVAC system had a problem that was preventing it to sustain heat for more than a couple of minutes. After making a few calls, I was recommended to JW to service my unit.  Marco arrived on time and diagnosed a couple of issues. Within a few minutes, he was able to give me a detailed and reasonable quote for the full repair service. The parts are still under warranty.  My experience with JW was excellent and Marco was professional and thorough. I recommend JW for anyone looking for HVAC services.< /review>

<Text>I have been using JW Heating and Air for several years. I like that they’re timely and provide excellent customer service. Leo was our technician during our service, and he was terrific! He took his time and answered all my questions.  He explained everything he would be checking as part of the service and provided updates as he went.

< review>
When you request an inspection, repair, or installation from a company that provides such services, you never really know what kind of customer service you'll be receiving from the repair person. Today I was rather fortunate to have have met Gerardo. Gerardo arrived promptly at our agreed  upon time, inspected, and then proceeded to review his assessment of the faults our system experiencing with me. As an electrical engineer myself, i appreciated his thorough assessment of the technical faults our system was experiencing, and subsequent recommendations for repairs. My experience with Gerardo today was nothing short of perfect. It must also be noted that along with his technical expertise, Gerardo had a tremendous attitude and a gift for communication.

Respectfully,

Ricardo<//review>

I am just a renter, but JW came out to service my air conditioner due to it breaking down.  Christian came out and was exceptionally kind and empathetic of the situation.  One of the most sincere guys I have ever met!  Must be because he's from Wyoming! Explained to me he was born and raised in a small town and learned HVAC at a mom and pop shop. Immediately made me feel like family! You do not find this type of service in Los Angeles and is something that most certainly cannot be taught. He got the unit up and running and was very thorough in what he was doing and was in contact with my landlord the entire time. He made the experience very seamless and gave me constant updates on where he was at in his process. I will most certainly be using JW and requesting Christian to come out when I buy my first home later this year. Thank you!!</Text>

Christian was scheduled to do the maintenance on our unit in October. JW had a cancellation and he arrived promptly after calling. He quickly assessed our current situation and then suggested some maintenance upgrades. He did these during this same appointment AND upgraded our thermostat. We will definitely be calling JW when our current system runs its course and, in the meantime, will be calling for the usual change-of-season maintenance. Thanks Christian!<//review>

We are moving into our new home and our AC unit wasn't cooling and where in desperate need of maintenance for our unit but we hassitated to contact a company. However having children and moving it was too much. We contacted JW plumbing as we read great reviews. Immediately the next day the appointment was scheduled.  Christian was the technician that came and met with my husband and we could not be more grateful for the amazing service he provided and how respectful, honesty and understanding he was. He let my husband know what the issues with the unit was and gave us several options and was never pushy. He gave great honest advice and went above and beyond to help us. Thank Christian we will continue to use JW services because of him for our AC repairs.  We could not be more grateful to you. My family was so happy to have our AC unit working again. Thank you I would highly recommend and ask for Christian he is the best!!</review>

<Review>It was easy to schedule an appointment and the office kept me updated on the ETA of my technician. Benny arrived on time and with all the necessary equipment.  He did a thorough inspection of my heating and cooling systems. He was very knowledgeable and explained his findings so that I was thoroughly informed. He made some recommendations but didn’t pressure me to make a decision right away. I will definitely use them to make the repairs.< /Review>< date>

<review>Christian was our tech and he absolutely nailed the job....!

He came in to adjust some dampers for upstairs for even distribution of air last week and we had him come back to set up a bi- annual service (which we decided to pay a monthly basis for a discounted rate) of our entire home which is quite significant.  He took photographs showed me everything that needed to be done, detailed everything before I approved the work, the price was good I felt confident in his abilities and the work that he did.
He’s serviced three industrial size central air conditioning units and condensers, furnaces, changed out all air filters in addition to servicing six split units (wall units and ceiling units combined).

Thank you so much for your professionalism and work ethic Christian. You answered all of my questions and provided real-time solutions which made just made sense!  You clearly know your craft well.

Deeply appreciated,

<Text>Benny was professional and thorough in understanding and analyzing the problem. He provided detailed explanations of each step he was going though and also eliminated all potential causes of the problem. I felt confident in his recommendations.
Getting an appointment was easy and prompt. Dispatch called to notify you when technician was on his way.
I definitely recommend JW Heating for HVAC and plumbing needs.< /Text></record>

Didn't get to see their work as they were rude and dismissive on the phone.  Based on the disrespectful tone when we called for service, we would never try to work with this company. There are plenty of other options available that will treat you with respect and do a good job.< /Review>

<Text>It was 108 degrees F in Los Angeles on Saturday evening of Labor Day weekend and my AC stopped working.   I bought the HVAC system from JW when I moved here 9 years ago and JW serviced it as recently as last February.  I called twice on Saturday evening and was told a technician would call me.  I called again on Sunday at 11am - still no call back.  As the mercury was rising, I left a message for the owner, Jeff Williams and he called me right back.  He said they had 500 calls in the past day.  Within 15 minutes, his dispatcher called and in 30 minutes, Benny, the technician, arrived.  Benny was great - he replaced the power distribution and filter and cleaned the condenser.  He believes the extra stress of the dirty filter and condenser along with the extreme heat, caused the power distribution to fail.  The bill was seriously high, but since my health was in danger, it was worth the price.  I will always ask for Benny in the future - he was helpful and knowledgeable and worked really hard in the extreme heat to get the job done.<//Text><time>1599439803594<//time><Name>Janet Eckholm</Name><user_id>118217477445009459654< /user_id><rate>4< /rate><GmapID>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1<//GmapID>< pictures>

today, he provided not just 5 star service, I would rate him as a 10. For any of my future J.W. Heating and Air appointments, I will ask that Peter be my technician.
He definitely is a “Keeper!”< /review>< pics>

<review>Gerardo came to our home to provide our 1-year service check and he could not have been more professional!  He came prepared with gloves, face mask and booties to enter our home and then worked efficiently.  We needed our filter replaced and he was able to do so on the spot for us.  He talked us through everything he was doing and even made recommendations on how to use the fan circulation feature more effectively.  Our two dogs were in love with him the minute he arrived, so I have no reservation of asking for him to come perform our service checks in the future!  Many thanks!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Angel and his partner were great. They were on-time, professional, informative and showed me the progress of the work throughout the day. They ensured that their work was reviewed by me and answered questions along the way. I would certainly use their services again.</Text>

<review>Very professional from the plumber to the office.  Very thorough and explained clearly on all services.  Paul was friendly and did an amazing job with all of the last minute fixes that needed to be done.  Denise in the office was friendly, and I appreciated the phone calls with updates and keeping my account accurate.  Would definitely recommend for all plumbing needs.< /review>< name>

Thank you JW Heating & air and to the technician Christian Eisenbarth! This guy saved thebday!!

Our  Air conditioner crashed and Christian was able to start it backup and running! We had 3 other vendors come out and not one of them even tried to resuscitate our unit - On one of the hottest weekends this year!

I've never met such a kind and considerate individual that takes pride in his profession.

What a great representative for JW Heating and Air

Thank you Christian!

This company was amazing! I originally called them in an emergency, and even though it was a holiday weekend they scheduled a same day evaluation and didn’t charge any emergency fees. They take 24/7 seriously!

I am an HOA rep and we had really bad issues with pipes in our garage and with pipes attached to multiple individual AC units. Because JW has HVAC specialists and plumbers, they were able to solve our issue on one day and with all their team members. Other companies had told me I would need multiple people to pick up the project at different phases, and this was so much easier.

The employees were respectful, knowledgeable, efficient, and kind. I enjoyed every step of working with them, from my first phone call to my final walk through of the finished repairs. I highly recommend them!</text>

<text>Had JW out to do my annual service. Christian was prompt and took all precautions necessary with to make me feel safe with Covid. He was extremely positive about life and wanted to be the highlight of my day! was such a refreshing energy to be around with everything going on! We turned on the furnace together to make sure it was working since this is the first time this year. Unit did not come on properly and he immediately identified the issue and guided me through his diagnosis process. He evaluated the whole unit and gave me options. We chose the bandaid option since finances are tight this year. Was very polite and clean! Very trustworthy and showed me all old parts and replacement parts with lots of pictures. Thank you:)</text>< user_name>

Wooowww!!!!
Words can’t even describe how amazed I was with today’s service. I read a couple of the latest reviews of one star and they make no sense to me. The entire process had so much communication, professionalism and kindness. Christian came out and diagnosed our furnace we have been having troubles with since it’s been installed, and the problem got bad enough to where it needed to finally be addressed. After quickly diagnosing the issue he gave me some options to pick from and explained to me why they are recommended. So many things about this call amazed me.  He was incredibly personable, and was not in a rush to get to work and genuinely cared about my well being. After the issue was diagnosed he submitted the information needed to the office to find the part. While we were waiting we talked about existential things like the universe, consciousness, meditation and other things with such depth and substance. It wasn’t small talk like the weather or politics. I truly feel like I became I better person after my conversations with Christian.  He is so wise for his age and light years ahead of me and I’m almost 60! I’ve been going through one of the hardest times in my life and this conversation gave me hope and excited for my future.  I talked his ear off and he genuinely listened and blew my mind with his optimism and perspectives. It actually took about 45 minutes or to find the part. Once they found it, he told me it was an hour away and that he will go drive and pick it up even though I told him we could reschedule since it will take a couple hours to get, he was determined to complete the job and give us heat before the weekend. He left, came back about 30 mins later and told us it turns out he’s not going to be able to pick up the part in time due to the warehouse closing. He said he was sorry we couldn’t couldn’t grab it, but he had good news.  HE CALLED AN UBER!!!!! Seriously had an Uber pick up the part and deliver it so he could get our furnace working. If that’s not 5 star service, I don’t know what is.
While we waited for the Uber we talked some more. JW has such an amazing young man representing this company and I will be forever grateful for the life lessons I was taught, I feel alive!

We could not have wished for a better service than was provided by Christian. He was thorough and took time to explain what he found wrong with our old units and what are options were to fix them.
The company was also very professional with their interactions, contacting us to confirm our appointment and then keeping us informed as to when we could expect the technician to arrive.
On every level this company provided the best experience.<//text>

My technician, Gerardo, was prompt and professional.  He was very respectful of my home and considerate of my in-house teleworker - that was much appreciated.  His review of the system was comprehensive, and he did a great job of walking me through and explaining what was needed.  I appreciated his transparency and thorough report.  I signed up for the monitoring agreement with no hesitation... I'm happy to do business with JW Plumbing, Heating and Air... thanks to Gerardo.</text>

We had our central heating and air installed by JW Plumbing and Heating in 2012 and have loved it. I'm actually glad JW provides two check-ups a year for a fee and that we subscribe to it. Otherwise I wouldn't do anything to take care of it's performance or maintenance. Sal did the inspection today and like all of his predecessors, he was courteous and efficient. I love my dealings with JW by phone or in person. Quality company!< /text>

After much searching and researching, we selected JW for a new air condition system and they were great. Every technician that we have dealt with was knowledgeable, professional and very thorough. Our recent maintenance was conducted by Gerardo and he is really wonderful.  We had a sort of tricky situation with a move and he worked to find us options and advised us in a very professional and non-sales’ish way. Our new house doesn’t have A/C and we will use Gerardo to install...no better recommendation than repeat business!< /Review>

Gerardo is the best!!  I highly recommend him from JW to do all of your servicing for your air-conditioning or heating units.  He was very knowledgeable, thorough, professional, and timely.  I don’t review often but I had to give Gerardo and JW heating & air a five star for sure.  If I would give them ten stars I could!!</review>

We called JW Cooling because our Nest thermostat was not getting power from the circuit. The technician Christian arrived on time and went to the attic to check on the AC unit.

After 15 minutes he says the circuit board needs to be replaced and it will cost $1200! Now I know the AC unit is working fine as the same company serviced it about a year ago and it was functioning perfectly up until 2 weeks ago when the thermostat wasn’t powering on.

I suspected it was just a wiring issue to the Nest thermostat and I indicated that in my service request.

After we said that we would get other companies to check and get a quote the technician said he would lower the price to $900 which was very suspicious.  When we didn’t agree to the repair, he went up the attic again and then says he thinks there’s nothing wrong with the circuit board and it was a wiring issue and it would cost $350 for the repair.

At this point, even if we still thought we were getting ripped off (to think we are repeat customers!), we wanted the problem fixed right away and agreed to pay the $350. The AC was up and running in 5 minutes - probably he just taped a loose wire that supplied power to the thermostat. He was in and out of the house in 45 minutes.

We will NEVER call this company again for any AC or heater issues. Neither should you.< /text>

<Response>{'time': 1592001907972, 'text': "Dear Jeffrey, as we pride our selves on our customers having an exceptional experience and being their choice for heating and air needs and your review concerns us greatly! I did find out that during our visit we first identified the control board as the failed component as we measured it's readings against manufacturer specifications and found that it was not operating as designed, as an existing customer the technician offered a discount for repair to make sure we could get you up and running that same day. From there, our technician continued his diagnostic and found that there was a wiring issue. Once that was identified as the main issue, we came back with the great news that the circuit board was fine and the wire repair was all you needed. I find it good news when we can save customers money but in your case sounds like maybe the technician did not communicate this very well at all and we will be having a discussion with him about this. Our core values that we strive for everyday are Honesty, Integrity and Accountability and I will not allow anything to deviate from these values so that customers can find trust in us. I would love to discuss this issue with you personally so please call me directly Jeffrey as your trust and experience is very important to me. Thank you, Jeff Williams JW Plumbing Heating & Air"}<//Response><date>1587758838607< /date><Gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Marco was the bomb! He was SO friendly and so quick! We needed the motor replaced on our AC unit and he drove all the way to get the replacement and back and fixed within a couple hours! Our 9 month old baby thanks you for that, he can now sleep in the cool air during this hot summer! Thanks Marco!<//text>

Beyond pleased with the communication, care and honesty. I can’t believe there’s actually amazing people out there who care! Our tech was kind and attentive and amazing. I wish I could hire him away from this company! They’re lucky to have him, and I’m lucky to have used such a great ac biz! Now, here’s hoping this fix lasts five more years!< /review>

I can’t say enough good things about my experiences with JW. They installed our new AC unit three years ago and everything was done perfectly. Today, I had them come back out for an annual service call. Marco arrived on time, complied with all COVID safety measures and was incredible. He was knowledgeable and efficient.  He provided options on how to keep my system running smoothly, explained all costs, and was just an all around great person to interact with.

I highly recommend JW.<//review>

I’ve continued to use them for my semiannual  HVAC inspection and have never been disappointed in their work or customer service.

I called JW Plumbing and Heating and got a very polite person who asked me questions about our issue.  Our issue was that our heater stopped working.  They scheduled their technician to come out and take a look.  Marco came in and took a look and changed out the thermostat and also changed the fuse at the heating unit.  He went above and beyond to show me some other potential issues and his recommendations for solutions for the long run.  He did a great job and was a really nice guy.  I really appreciated the good work.  I would definitely use the company again.</Text>

These guys were terrific!  They were on time, did a full diagnosis of the problem, presented options for the needed repairs at reasonable price points to ensure I had full information (for example:  do I prefer to clean the filter or replace it?  Repair the aging motor or replace it with a new one? Etc).  The lead team member, Leo, showed me before/after pictures of everything they worked on to ensure I understood the work they completed and they follow that up with a full report detailing the work, with photos, for my files.  They were polite, professional, friendly and fast.  I will definitely use them again and highly recommend them to anyone with heating and air needs.  Great service!<//Review>

I had a terrible experience with a competitor. This firm fixed the problems in the most cost effective manner possible. They them replaced an entire AC system starting with a proper survey, educations is on options and implications, and pricing the installation fairly. They delivered as promised. I highly recommend them for maintenance or new systems. Professional, smart, good value for money, nice people too. RG.< /text>

<review>Friendly. The technician, Victor, came out to assess the situation. I am a DYI type but had no availability to fix our blown motor that day. The price to solve the blower was about 5 times higher than the part only price if I ordered it from Amazon and did it myself. So I have to justify it by the convenience and headache free experience. Victor was finished in 2 hours and treated us with high professionalism.<//review>< userid>

JW Heating and Air has always been outstanding!  It has been the best home improvement investment we have ever made.
Bryan G. who came out to our house today has been an eye opener to what exceptional customer service can be. He should be a role model for others to follow. Thank you Bryan for your courteous and empathetic demeanor.
All the best to you!!!!< /text>

< Review>
HIGHLY recommend!!
JW Heating and Air is a first rate, professional, 5-star company! Quality and customer service are alive and well! It is so refreshing to see a business embrace these fundamentals. My experience from the first phone call to the service call itself was nothing but pleasant and professional. Communication was great. My service technician, Peter, was outstanding!  He was punctual, kind and considerate, and very knowledgable, and extremely thorough. He carefully took his time in diagnosing the problem with my heating unit and explained every step of the process to me to keep me in the loop. He was not going anywhere until he got to the bottom of the issue. I appreciate this kind of transparency. It puts the customer at ease when everything is clearly laid out and all options are presented. Bottom line is: Peter and this company clearly take pride in their work and hold their customers in the highest regard. I'm not one to usually write reviews of my dealings with service industries, but my experience today compelled me to share my satisfaction. Great work! Will definitely recommend to others!<//Review>

<Text>They charged me $99 for coming to check my air condition. They said the only thing I can do is change the filter for $20, which is not included with the $99.

They told me my AC unit is 19 years old when it was changed 10 years ago. They gave me a quote for $10,000 to change my unit.

I got another guy to come and they changed the filter and said my unit was fine and working properly.

So basically I paid $99 for nothing. They would not even change the filter!

The system we believe is very much past 10 years and it was our service technicians opinion was that it was a better value to replace the system rather than install a lot of parts and then end up replacing the system shortly after.

<Rating>5</Rating><review>I had Christian out from JW to service my AC a couple weeks ago.  I was hesitant to bring any one into my home due to Covid-19. The office assured me that they are taking the necessary precautions to keep us, and their staff safe during this time.  Christian came on time and wore  gloves, shoe covers, and a mask.  He even disinfected every thing he touched before he left with an organic cleaning solution.  He was very kind and genuine, and asked genuine questions and expressed a lot of empathy with how we are doing during this time. Stated he is very grateful to still be working and very blessed.  He also said its been very hard on him to see so many families struggle during this time since he's interacting with new people every day who are no longer working or had lost their job or business.  Also informed me that they have been keeping busy with air purification solutions that can help remove viruses and other things from the home, he left me information on it and wasn't pushy at all about selling me it, it felt it was necessary to at least let me know during these times. I am unable to make that investment at this time, but I referred JW and christian to a couple friends who are interested in having them out to install.  Thank you very much!< /review>< Pics>

Gerardo Tecorral, my A/C Technician, was exceptional. He was very articulate, polite, professional, knowledgeable, thorough, efficient, and hardworking!
Because he is genuinely concerned about clients home environment shared some literature on home air purifiers.  After reading about the iWave, I purchased this system!  I am thrilled with the results!

Because Gerardo is an awesome technician with stellar communication and technical skills, JW Heating and Air is now my “go-to” company for all my heating and plumbing needs.  I will also refer Gerardo and your company to all my friends and neighbors.<//Review>

They got us up and cooling in a short amount of time.

We used JW to replace our central HVAC unit. They were responsive, easy to work with, and efficient. The work was done well and for the estimated cost. We needed a service call several months later and they were responsive and friendly. Peter, the technician who came to my home, was knowledgeable, pleasant and very thorough. I highly recommend JW. A great overall experience.</review>

You want a guy who knows how to represent your company?  Christian is the guy.  First time in forever that someone took the time to explain a technical situation in clearly broken-up sections, then walk me through the options, then make reasonable, not money-grubbing, suggestions.  Great guy. Give him a raise and count yourself lucky!<//Text>

We’ve used JW for years, they always give top notch service in the home. The workers today were very friendly and respectful of keeping masks on and not touching unnecessary things in the house during the pandemic. They also are careful to take on and off booties to protect the floor which I appreciate.</Review>

I appreciated the commitment to utilizing PPE. I am most thankful for Mr. Victor’s patience and willingness to answer my  6 year old son’s curious questions.  Our air conditioner is up and running, and my son learned about the engineering of a machine. Thank you!< /Text>

<resp>None< /resp><Text>Bryan (Technican) was truly wonderful. Super respectful, knowledgeable and efficient. Diagnosed and fixed the issue very fast. For the repair and service the cost was fair but be careful of their add ons and up sells. Bryan was by no means pushy but the company model seems to be to add on certain items that feel a bit unnecessary. I ended up passing on the add on items and just went with the bandaid repair due to the high cost of the extra options. All in all, I would use them again and very happy I went with them. Ask for Bryan If he’s available. I wish all service calls went as smoothly as this one.< /Text>< Rating>

<rating>5</rating><text>A/C died over the weekend. Called first thing Monday morning and was on the list for an appointment same day. No specific time slot, but was updated with ETA throughout the day. Marcos arrived and diagnosed the issue (components) quickly. He and his tablet walked me through the cost/replacements in a way that was easy to understand. Sidenote, glad it is all on tablet and not triplicate. He offered additional services for future proofing that didn't make me feel coerced/dire if I didn't go for extras. Components in Van and a/c is running within two hours. Covid aware and polite in requests. Will use again.<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1< /Gmap_id>< username>

I never experienced great service until Antonio showed up from JW heating...He is very knowledgeable and a true professional as he explained everything in detail so I can understand...He even showed me on the things that needed to be service and explained why it was necessary...I’m sticking with JW Heating because of people like Antonio !  Thanks !<//Review>

Marco is a well trained, experienced air conditioning and heating equipment technician for one of the best companies for in Los Angeles with whom we have a long history of excellent service. Marco has an excellent work ethic, he diagnosed the problem with our condenser, explained what had to be done, how much it would cost and assured us that he had extensive experience repairing the problem.
We expected that it would take several days for him to receive the parts needed for the repair but he went out of his way to pick up the parts and did the repair the next day. Extraordinary service!!!! Drs. LBV</Text>

We are pleased to have JW Heating and Air as our new A/C and Furnace maintenance people. I researched the company and was impressed with the response I received from the Manager, Dave! He arranged for a special
tech to service our home. Sal was early for the appointment and met with
the standards I would expect from a company with JW 's reputation.
Thank you, Dave!< /review>

<review>Your sales representative was quite knowledgeable about the most current and efficient ways to provide heating and cooling for our house. He explained everything thoroughly and at the same time gave us other options that could meet our needs.  I really liked Mr. Leaches manner and approach.  I liked the fact that the installation would be provided directly by your in house technicians using high quality and state of the art products.  I will keep in mind all of this in arriving at our decision.  Sincerely, Frank Farfan< /review>< user>

As Christian was troubleshooting my system, he took the time to explain everything to me.  He seemed very thorough and knowledgeable.  Also, there wasn’t any pushy sales pitch - he just presented the facts and explained the options I might want to consider.  Every person that I had contact with was really pleasant.  They might be on the pricey side but you get what you pay for.<//text>

<review>This review may sound cheesy, but I’m honestly writing it because of how great our experience was. Gerado Tecorral was beyond amazing. Im always a little nervous and skeptical when a new person comes in to repair something in our home. Right away he was so kind, respectful of our space and explained every step. He was also super nice to our barking dogs and took the time to sit and let them get used to him. He kept us updated through the whole process, there was a good amount to fix and he showed us before and after pictures of everything. I would hire him to fix every part of our house. This guy deserves a promotion! Seriously. Super thankful we got him and chose to go with this company :) You can tell they care about their customers.< /review>< pics>

<Review>Couldn't have been happier. Our tech Sal arrived on time and his professionalism was outstanding. He explained the process he would need to go through in order to fix our a/c unit and gave me an estimate for the various options available to me. The cost was not cheap but you get what you pay for. I feel I received excellent service for the price I paid so I'm completely satisfied. Would definitely call JW again for repairs and request Sal.</Review>< UserId.>

<Review>I called JW Heating & Air after receiving a special for a $49 furnace and A/C inspection. I was worried that for such a low price, I might not get exceptional service. I was wrong. It was definitely a 5 star experience. They called to ask about any time scheduling concerns, then called again when the technician was on his way. The technician (Christian) arrived right on time, was friendly, courteous, and very professional. He did not rush and thoroughly checked out both units. When finding an issue with the A/C unit, he recommended a repair, but did not push and did not give a "today only" price. He also offered answers to some allergy (and clean air) concerns, but again... did not initiate any high pressure sales tactics. I will definitely call this company back after researching and making some decisions... and will also request Christian as the technician.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>As always, the JW guys were fantastic.  I had Travis and Antonio over for the bi-annual maintenance. They were friendly, informative, and willing to go above and beyond. They walked me through everything and made sure I understood everything they were doing. They also didn't try to upsell me on things I didn't need. Cannot do better than JW, to be honest.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Michael came out from JW Heating to inspect our current heating system and give us options for adding air conditioning to our home.  He was extremely thorough, calculating every option to give us the most efficient and cost effective system which is what we're looking for.  He took as much time as we needed to answer ALL our questions, which were numerous.

Thanks again Michael!<//Review>

We had a complete HVAC installed last June; 3T Unit, all new duct work, relocation of two and addition of one more ceiling vents and a complimentary Nest thermostat ... three days ago our heat wasn't working consistent with how we set the temp on the thermostat and then this morning it wasn't heating at all.  I called early in the morning and they were able to put me on the schedule for today. (BTW - I've never had a company keep in touch on the status of their arrival more, or better, than JW does!)

Christian came out to diagnose the problem - and wouldn't you know .... the heat came on!!!!???!!! I talked him through all the *symptoms* of what had been going on, he asked questions and then went to looking for any irregularities with the system. He did his best, but -since the heat was now working- he was hard pressed to find a culprit. He did take off and clean a sensor, which he says sometime can be an issue, though he didn't feel strongly that it was in this case, but it didn't hurt to do at least that just in case (an appreciated show of good faith on his part, for sure). Anyway, so in the absence of any findings to the issue, which was now a non-issue, Christian left. He, however assured me should it fail again do not hesitate to call them back out - they want to make it right! He also let me know something I did not know - in the event that the system fails again, not to shut it off completely, to simply adjust the settings to allow the system to go into stand-by so they can read any error codes from the unit.

In all my years of being a homeowner I can say when you find a service company that follows through, stands behind their equipment and labor and commits to making it right then you stay with that company. JW Heating and Air is that company for me! This is my second unit install and services with JW, we had a new system put in our son's condo as well, and every time; be it scheduling with the office personnel, meeting and working with a sales person, or meeting with a technician, they have always made me feel like a valued customer.

Thank you Christian, and thank you JW Heating & Air ... again!< /review>

We were looking to replace our 30 year-old unit and got estimates from various installers in our area.  In the end, we went with the Costco Heating and Air program.  In our area, JW Heating and Air were the vendor that did the work under the Costco program.  The installers were awesome.  Thank you Jesse and his team (Miguel and Anthony).  Very professional installers and patient with all my questions.

There are many companies who are qualified to install AC and heating but JW stands out because of the installers and quality of work.  When we did the HERS testing, the inspector also commented on the quality of the installation.  It was nice that the owner called to follow up on the installation and to see if there were any issues.< /review>

Michael was straight forward and honest about pricing and our options with no pressure to sign on the spot at the initial consultation. We didn’t end up moving forward with AC/heating due to a change in finances. We have not received any phone calls, text messages or emails since our consultation, which is surprising but appreciated. We will definitely use JW Heating and Air when we are ready because it seems like a solid and trustworthy company.< /Review>

Great service from Antonio who explained each and every step of the routine maintenance service he performed.  I thought he was very friendly and informative.  He showed me the filter he replaced in our unit as well as photos of various components. We will definitely request him again because he was overall a great service provider who communicates well with customers.< /review>

My husband and I agree to replace the defective parts. We want a peace of mind. We didn’t want to chance  anything to happen...
Marcos did a great job on our heater. Marcos was honest and we trusted his judgements. He is very respectful too..

Bryan at JW Heating and Air is awesome! He went out of his way to check my mom's system and took the time to explain everything! He was very friendly, polite, and someone we were very comfortable having in the house! My mom is 92 years old and he took time out of his busy schedule to visit with her! That meant the world to her! We will always request Bryan when we call for maintenance or service! Thank you Bryan for taking such good care of us!<//text>

My wife and I recently had our heater serviced by Antonio who works for JW Heating & Air. Antonio was punctual, polite, efficient and very clear when he explain what he was doing. A lot of time home service companies are not very strong in the customer service department, leaving you feeling uneasy about the service and price. My experience with JW Heating has been the exception. They are clear with what they will be doing, when they will be arriving and what the cost is. I highly recommend JW Heating & Air (and if you're lucky enough to get Antonio) to anyone with home heating and/or air service needs.</review>

Marco was awesome. Old air conditioning unit sounded like a jet engine, he fixed the fan housing and saved me from having to replace the entire unit.</Review>

Back in April I was in the middle of purchasing our home.  Marco came out and inspected our system and found issues with our hvac system.  He took pictures and showed us what needed to be done.  I would definitely recommend jw and Marco with friends and family<//text>

He took care to not track the copious mud from my front steps into the house, which is no easy task.  He was incredibly pleasant and personable, and made sure I understood what he was doing and what his findings were.  Unfortunately the heater was beyond help, but he checked each of my room units and cleaned the filters, as well as checking the outside fan and making sure everything was in good shape.

I like to say that Marco is a very professional technician. He keeps his customer abreast every step of the way. He explained everything in detail, which was a refreshing change from other companies.

If we have additional problems, I will personally ask for Marco. Credit where credit is due;  he did an absolutely wonderful job!
Thank you.</text>

I'm a good friend of Christian and while back at home visiting for the holidays, he took time to check my furnace which stopped working and coming from someone who didn't know a single thing about JW or furnaces at all, it was awesome to get some background and learn how things work. He explained things in a way I could understand, and offered fantastic suggestions for future maintenance. He also fixed my fire place. He takes pride in his work and it shows, and spoke so highly of JW and how happy he is working there.  I'm really happy with his success in Los Angeles and that he found a company that makes him feel like home.  Couldn't have happened to a better guy.  Please request Christian for any of your needs, because he truly finds art in his work and will provide a genuine human experience. He is the kindest most honest man I know, and you should meet him< /review>

We've had a lot of work done by JW—from inspections to AC repairs to a full furnace replacement. They are consistently great—always on time, if not a little early. They're always really easy to communicate with and respectful of my home and schedule. I especially appreciate the time every single person from JW takes to thoughtfully answer my questions and educate me about the work and equipment. We wouldn't use any other company for our hvac needs.< /Text>

PLEASE READ ALL!
I felt  my lack of ac knowledge allowed for some shady  dealings. I had a tech named victor.  Whom now after getting a second opinion, did not have  the know how to properly  diagnose  my ac problem. He stated i need my outside ac unit replace because there was a leak. He tried to show me where it was but could not see where the dye had leaked out. Made me skeptical.
When i received the invoice the picture he stated was the leak was in a differt spot than what he had tried to show me. When i questioned some of his doing he told me if i didnt trust him to get a second opinion.  This could of cost me 1500 just for the unit not including installing. After a second opinion i come to find out it is my unit inside my house not allowing for proper air flow, basically the coils inside my inside unit are clogged with dust. Replacing the outside unit would have done nothing and i would have been in the hole alot of money.

Because i cannot  respond to whom ever wrote me... i want to clarify,  that i did not have 2 companies come and recharge or add refridgerant.  The original company who installed my unit 11 years  ago came out 2 time to adjust the refrigerant.  Your pictures are inaccurate to what a leake looks like with dye/sealant  put in. I would never trust your company in my residence again. Luckily i have found  a very honest  technician who has completely fix my problem which  WASN'T a leak!< /review>

After speaking with Victor, you had two other companies it the past that added refrigerant due to leaks and Victor found a refrigerant leak as well. We added dye and have pictures of where the refrigerant oil has leaked out. If your not repairing it now please give us a call when it leaks out again and we would be more than happy to repair the leak or offer you other options as well. We would look forward to resolving this for you. The JW Team'}</response>

Extremely pleased with JW Plumbing from start to "finish."  Michael Campbell, the JW Customer Rep was knowledgeable, professional, and a nice guy.  He was very thorough in explaining what work would be required, the equipment that would provided (with options and recommendations), and provided two quotes- one if the new A/C unit could be installed near the existing unit and the second if the new A/C unit had to be moved to the back of the house depending upon where our property line was.
Although JW was not the cheapest quote that I got, Michael explained that JW employees were highly trained and long time, bonded employees; all equipment provided were of high quality- e.g., Lennox A/C and Heater; and that City inspectors would certify their work.  (Michael said JW Heating & Air will only do a job the right way.)  The price was a little less painful after Michael indicated that Costco would provide a 10% gift card, and we would also be eligible to receive a couple more discounts/rebates.
Michael left me his business card, company brochure, information of the Lennox equipment that would be installed, and a copy of the work order.
The next day, Steven, the manager of the installation teams came by to inspect our premise to make sure the installers would have everything they would need to complete the job in two days.  Steven was very professional, personable, and reassuring.
First thing Monday morning 7 A.M., Steven introduced me to Ramon, the team leader of the installation crew, and a couple of the people who would be installing the HVAC system.  Ramon and his crew were great.  They were extremely, extremely polite and humble, efficient, quiet, and neat and hard working.  They covered the floor with tarp, cleaned-up at the end of the day, and were tidy during the day.  After the crew was done for the day at 3:30 P.M. , my wife  pointed out a number of problem that she found, e.g., a crack in the ceiling, a gap around the a/c pipe outside, and a couple of light switches that were not working now.
The next morning, Ramon and his crew were at the house at 7 A.M. again ready to work.  I talked to Ramon about the problems that my wife had discovered the previous day.  Ramon was polite, listened patiently, and said in a very reassuring tone that they would take care of them (which they did).  Again, his crew was very polite, efficient, and neat.  By 3:30 the crew had finished their work and left.  Again, they cleaned up everything, inside and outside the house. The work looked beautiful.  Very clean and professional.  (The entire process from start, first call, to "finish", installation, took only one week.)
Ramon stayed behind to make sure the HVAC system was working properly and explain how to operate the new system.  The a/c worked perfectly.  The heater, unfortunately, would not come on.  Ramon worked on the heater for one and a half hours, but could not fix the problem despite calling the office.  JW called me later that day and said they would send someone in the morning to look at the heater.
The next morning, Steven (the manager of the installation crew) came by to inspect the heater. Steven said he thinks the problem is a defective part and explained the function of the part.   Steven said this was the second a/c unit in 20 units they had installed that had this problem. Because this was a new unit, he was hopeful that they would get the replacement part and be able to fix the problem by next week and of course there would be no charge.
Although the job is not "finished," I am confident that JW will fix the problem.  (I'm just glad that it's the heater that is not working and not the a/c!.)  The primary reason, my wife and I went with JW Heating & Air is because they are a Costco vendor.  Based upon my dealing with JW,  I am glad that we did.

<Review>David was great. He showed up and walked me through everything that was going on. Unfortunately there was some bad news, whoever had installed the system before we owned the house did it completely incorrectly and we basically had to start over. He showed me photos, drew out a diagram, and answered every question I had. Tough pill to swallow having to get a new system installed but David’s knowledge and clarity made going with them an easy choice. Highly recommended.</Review>< Pics>

When reading   online reviews for JW heating and Air the first thing that will stand out is how they are predominantly very positive and it becomes even more evident when the reviews are compared to similar  businesses.  From the first time you speak to someone on the telephone until the service is completed  you experience excellent customer service. I recently purchased a new heating and air conditioning system to replace an older system. . Everything happened exactly on the timeline as described.  From the initial estimate appointment to the follow up phone calls about the sales call service, the on-site visit to prepare for the insulation and finally for the actual installation.  On the installation day the installation team arrived on time, set up inside and outside in a way to least disturb me and my neighbors. The installation supervisor explained what was happening during the course of the day. The entire installation team was friendly, professional, and courteous.After the job  was completed, the team cleaned everything and left no trace they had been there. A checklist was completed by the installation supervisor and reviewed with me to ensure my complete satisfaction. It was stressed to me that if I had any questions or concerns to let them know immediately  as it was the goal of JW Heating & Air to provide services which exceeded their   customers expectations. This is a company I would highly recommend. Your time and money will be well spent.</text>

<review>Thank goodness for JW Heating & Air!! Their technician Christian really did a great job and was so professional. Our air was out and we really needed them. They took care of us on the same day, and I couldn’t be happier.

I highly suggest them!< /review>< rate>

JW Heating and Air is really wonderful... but, what makes it absolutely FANTASTIC are service people like Marco.  He was by far the best I have had yet.  He was honest, kind, and went above and beyond to tell me what needed to be done, what didn't need to be done, and what to expect.  I always worry about the "sales pitch" for each maintenance visit but I felt Marco really tried to focus on the necessities to keep my system running versus parts and service that were not mandatory.  I really hope Marco stays a part of the team as I want him back for each visit.  Thank you!</review>

<review>From my first telephone call I was very pleased with the service,  I believe her name was (Theresa?) and then  Mr Juan Sierra service technician was outstanding.  He listened to my concerns asked lots of questions and after. Inspecting my equipment he walked me through his findings.  He then explained a game plan to remedy the problems.

<review>So, I had J W Heating & Air back last week to clean the duct work on our master level.  Angel, while servicing the HVAC unit the week prior, recommended that we clean the duct work due to its being covered in drywall dust & dog hair.  I had been putting it off because it sounded like a huge, expensive undertaking.  Turned out that was not the case.  James & Travis of J W Heating & Air showed up early by 15 minutes, set up shop and proceeded to tackle the task.  Seeing the ducts before & after the cleaning was freaking unbelievable.  Not only were the ducts sparkling clean, the air smelled better.  James explained that they use Simple Green to polish the ducts and that's what I was smelling.  I thought he mentioned placing scent sticks inside the ducts, but I may be mistaken on that point.  When finished cleaning the ducts, James & Travis cleaned up and left the area cleaner than when they came.  From start to completion, James & Travis were here for ~ 2 ¾ - 3 hours.  Once again, J W Heating & Air excelled in the services they provide.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><rating>5</rating></record>

I don’t remember why I called JW in the first place last fall but I'm so glad i got the maintenance plan and know exactly whom to call when i need a repair. Likely I’ll need a whole new system in the next few years and I’ll feel comfortable calling them to do it.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1<//gmap_id>< resp>

The technician arrived on time for the service call. He explained the procedures well. He did a great job installing, testing, and cleaning the equipment! I was just a little confused on the pricing. I thought I heard two different service fees, one from the operator during the service call, and a different price from the technician. But it all worked out.< /text>

I received several estimates for a mini-split HVAC system and went with JW. JW installed a complete system in my condo remodel. They did a spectacular job. From the initial estimate, pulling the permit and dealing with Santa Monica planning through passing inspection, the people at JW were consummate professionals. Their employees are punctual, courteous, clean (wore booties without being asked), and highly skilled.

Their work is high-end commercial quality. It is the Rolls Royce of HVAC companies. I could not be happier with the entire experience. And now seeing just how amazing a mini-split system is, I will never go back to a giant noisy furnace with dusty ducts... I highly recommend JW to anyone in need of HVAC services. They do not rest until you are completely satisfied.< /text>

Dale came to the house for maintenance on our unit and he was polite, professional and courteous. We have a no shoe policy in our home and before I had a chance to ask he was already putting shoe covers on!! He thoroughly examined our unit made some suggestions on how to keep the system running optimally. Overall great experience!</review>

<review>JW originally installed our a/c and heater in 2016. JW was not the least expensive, but worth the additional cost. Our sales person was Dustin and he was great throughout the process. Our most recent tech Marco, was very thorough, detail oriented and gave me some solutions to issues that I've had for a few years with the a/c unit. Will continue to use them for my maintenance, hopefully for years to come!< /review>< pictures>

The A/C unit stopped working, and I had to find a company that serviced the Arcadia area. As usual, I posted a request on Angie's List to get some quotes and JW Heating, and Air was the first to respond. Gerardo was very prompt and arrived earlier than I had expected. He was very courteous and got started immediately to diagnose the problem. The best part was that he explained what he was doing each step and was very thorough, documenting with photos at each stage. After the diagnosis, I was given three options as to how to move forward. The compressor and HVAC being almost 20 years old, it was comforting to understand what my options were. In the short term, I needed the unit to function throughout the summer. In the long run, install a brand new system. I would say they are not cheap, but this is one area I would spend a little more money on as safety is always a consideration and you want the job done right the first time as all things considered these systems should easily last 10 to 15 years.<//Text>

Gerardo showed up after texting me he was on his way. He was very professional, knowledgeable and polite!  Gerardo was incredibly thorough and took photos. At the end he gave me a detailed report of my Heating and AC!  He left my home clean.  I purchased the annual contract which has a technician come Our twice a year to service my unit. I have had it for years and will continue to renew.

Thanks for doing such a great job!< /review>

We started on the wrong foot 4 years ago, with this company. We bought our Ac,heater unit from them. First couldn't have a permit from the city because we had a gas leak. They came and fixed the leak. Then after the first rain we had water coming out of the vents on top of our TV because the platform for the unit was badly done.  They came and fixed it.
Now after 4 years,  not mentioning that we'r still paying for $13,000 unit, we have a freon gas leak due to a defective part. The part is under warranty but we have to play$900 for labor.
I am giving 5 stars because despite of those problems,  this company took care of us. Gerardo, was a great tech, he explained everything very well to me. I trust him.</review>

I have been a customer of JW for years and they never disappoint. Their technicians are well trained, clean, articulate and take the time to explain everything. The staff on the phone are courteous, buttoned up and confirm every appt. special shout out to Marco and Travis who handled my duct cleaning this past weekend. They were great. I am not one who writes a lot of reviews but this company is top notch.< /Review>

He patiently showed me photos of the inside and out of the equipment and shared with me all of the issues he spotted.  He gave me the short term option but was clearly concerned with safety issues so also shared with me a longterm option.

<Pics>None</Pics><text>This is an honest, reputable company.
There was an initial problem with making my appointment. Within 24 hours, the owner of the company called me to explain the circumstances, take responsibility, apologize, and offer me a discount. I understand that problems happen, sometimes beyond our control, and how this company dealt with it shows that they live their values. He dispatched the next available technician who arrived within 90 minutes.

Gerardo, our technician, was wonderful. He was professional and even put on booties and a floor covering to make sure our floor stayed clean.  He was extremely thorough and explained everything. Although he did not have the part we needed, he found a solution so we had our heat restored and will be back to finalize our repair once the part is ordered.

We are fans of JW because they know how to treat customers.< /text>< userid>

<Review>While I was dubious about this process - I felt like I ask a different HVAC specialist and get a different answer - I am REALLY enjoying working with Gerardo. He really got to the bottom of the problem and was able to explain why other highly qualified people came up with different answers.

They answered all my questions and the install was perfect. They checked in with me every morning to give me a run down on the services they were providing for that day. They also checked in with me when they left the house.< /Review><user>106327213454107494240</user>< name>

I couldn't have been more pleased with Juan. Showed up on time, explained everything he was doing, fixed my problem & left the house clean. You're doing an excellent job with Staff training in office & field. This was a large Financial investment for us originally and I'm SO glad we went with JW. Whenever I've had a problem you folks have actually made a point to be sure & respond right away.  The staff and the service couldn't be better & is really appreciated.

Our technician did a full technical maintenance of our 3 air conditioning units, changed all filters and did a full cleaning of our 3 outdoor A/C units.  He was very professional, very respectful and a great member of JW’s HVAC team.  We signed up for twice yearly maintenance as well as replacing a 5 ton A/C unit with them this past April.  Wonderful, reliable service and we look forward to continue to be satisfied customers for years to come!!!</review>

Technician David clearly explained what was happening and laid out several options to move forward and maintain my HVAC system. We hardly use the heater here in SoCal, but we live on that AC.< /review>

I’m just a tendant, but it was nice knowing how thorough Christian was and how knowledgeable he was about the systems in this home. Very friendly! Usually dealing with people inside your home is awkward, but he felt like a family member and played with my dog for about 10 minutes after the work was completed!</Review>

I was referred to JW Heating & Air through the LADWP AC Optimization Program. My appointment was scheduled for 9a today. They called at 8:30a to let me know Christian would be about 15 minutes late. He arrived at 9:10a.
Christian was excellent. He conducted a thorough diagnostic test of all my equipment and performed a tune-up all while explaining and showing me what he was doing and finding. I definitely will use their services going forward (requesting Christian) and will recommend them to anyone needing HVAC service.<//text>

<Review>After the hot summers over the past four years, we finally decided to get an AC system installed.  We interviewed 3 contractors and JW Heating and Air stood out above the rest with their knowledge, recommendations, friendliness, and competitive  pricing.  We are so delighted with the service they provided.  We decided to update our 15 year old furnace at the same time.  The controllers they recommended have such user-friendly screens (we were thinking about Nest but Ted recommended another as being easier to use. Comparing notes with a neighbor who has Nest, they said it can be a bit cumbersome.  We are very happy with the choice).  Our AC system cools like a dream!  All of the JW Heating and Air workers who came to the house were clean, friendly, and super nice people.  I was so impressed when they brought their own hand soap and paper towels to use in our bathrooms- so considerate.  They always put on shoe covers whenever they entered the house.  Their work is excellent and clean up was fantastic.  While the whole process took about a week (new heating and air systems), everyone involved was a pleasure to work with.  They facilitated city inspectors and helped us get the final sign off inspection.  So happy we finally "bit the bullet" and got our updated heating and new AC!</Review>< Pics>

<text>The technician from J.W. Heating was polite, helpful and thorough. When failing components were found in the compressor unit, he had photos of the damage or incorrect readings to show me on his tablet. Good policy.

On the other hand, the installation of the replacement components was astonishingly expensive, especially given the function of the parts involved and their retail cost. Installation took less time than diagnosis. Regrettably, all this is common practice, not unique to the HVAC business.< /text>< Pictures>

I called JW Heating and Air, and the technician Marco Bercian came to my house. He was polite and very professional. He assessed the problem, and upon giving me an estimate and I approved it, he worked on the unit and got the problem solved. I called again a few days later because I had some problems, but it turned out that I just wasn't setting it up the right way. The air conditioning unit is now working, and Marco did an excellent job. Thank you Marco, and thank you JW.<//Review><gmapID>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1<//gmapID>< user>

I had a great experience with JW heating and air conditioning when I replaced both units in my 1952 year old home. Their employees go above and beyond by making sure the process goes smoothly and efficiently. They do not try to sell you something you don’t need. Initially I had asked to have the technology to cool and heat separate sections of the house so as to run heating or cooling for only the rooms we used most often. But as it turned out I didn’t need the extra expense this would have cost me because my home is under 1500 square feet and one story. It is cooled and heated comfortably without that extra feature.

They also helped me with the permit process which can be problematic. I am grateful and happy I found the right company that demonstrated both honesty and integrity to their clients.

Thank you JW Heating and Air,

<Text>JW Heating & Air gets another A+ for consistency!  We needed the filters changed and checked on my elderly aunt's home, so we called JW who had installed her new HVAC system last November.  Since she lives near the airport, we were/are especially concerned about "airplane dust".  The tech who showed up today, Christian, was awesome!  Right on time as scheduled, and very knowledgeable about the systems, how they work, and provided us with several options to further improve the air quality in the home, which we took him up on.  And, he did all this without being sales-zy at all.  An extra plus, Christian was super kind and chill with my aunt;  some people just ignore the elderly as if they aren't even there, not this guy.  Highly recommended.</Text><Response>{'time': 1570634443223, 'text': "Wow, Shelly! Thank you so much for leaving this incredible review!

<text>I had a really terrific experience with David from JW Heating and Air.
I have been using them for 20 years now, but this time I needed a lot of
work done.  He explained everything to me in great detail which i really appreciated.  He took photos of the problems and showed them to me.  I needed a new battery as well as a tray to catch potential water run off.  I am also going to get dampers for all of my vents that he said were not well insulated.  He always shows up exactly on time, and i like that he takes so much time to explain it everything to me.  David is a gem, and I am sure JW values him enormously!  When I bought my home 20 years ago, Jeff (the owner) came out to service my house.  I never forgot how kind, patient, and honest he was.  I've used them ever since.< /text><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1550604465242, 'text': 'Wow, thank you so much for this glowing review, Nancy.

From the initial consult to the final good bye, JW Heating was professional, courteous, and timely.  They were clean, infinitely respectful of the house and contents, and were able to work with the intricacies of a house built in the 1930s.  Ted managed the project and Ishmael, Fernando, and Aldo were the technicians on site.  They were all fabulous and I highly, highly recommend them.<//Text>

<Review>We used JW Heating and Air and they did a wonderful job on our AC install which was a full cut-in job with new ducts.  They worked with us on placing the condenser in just the right place which was tricky in our case.  They facilitated all the necessary city inspections and we're thoroughly enjoying our cool home in this heat.  Their workers were clean, efficient, on time and did excellent work.

I called JW Heating and Air to have our A/C inspected, tuned up, charged up, etc. because it felt as though the cool air was not as cool as it once was.
I was surprised to get an appointment within 3 days even though we are in the middle of a punishing heatwave.
Angel was the technician who showed up
- early by 5 minutes - and devoted six hours to caring for our 3 A/C units.  Angel was very knowledgeable & kept me in the loop as he progressed through the house.  He had every part he needed on his truck so there was no time lost chasing down parts - a pet peeve of mine.  In the end, it was not cheap but you get what you pay for and I am more than pleased that I've got functioning, efficient A/C units again.
I will definitely use JW Heating and Air in the future - and I will ask for Angel to be the technician.</Text>

Great service. The technician took the time to thoroughly inspect my system, diagnose the problem, and present me the various options for fixing things. He made sure to keep everything clean in and around the work area and tested the system to make sure it worked perfectly afterwards. He was friendly and professional.

<Text>I am pleased so far with JW Heating and Air.
I hoped I would chose right when looking for  a company to do my HVAC installation.
I also wanted them to be responsible and
supportive BEFORE and AFTER the work is finished.
Ted came and spoke with me about what was needed and carefully explained the process and estimate.
I feel good that he makes himself available for any thoughts and questions.
I will update my review after the work is finished.

<review>My experience with JW Heating and Air could not have been better. A+.
Ted, our sales person was super patient and great at walking us through everything and Ismael, the lead technician was really cool and talented and ran a great crew.They left our house spotless after 3 days of really challenging work.
Probably most importantly though is that our house is a PERFECT temperature in spite of a summer heat wave.
I would highly recommend JW to anyone.<//review>< Name>

Christian arrived promptly, checked air conditioner and heater. Very up front about their condition. Set me up with appointment for estimate on replacement. Personable but didn’t waste time. Greatly appreciate his frankness.
Gerardo extended his day to check my AC. He followed the protocols of the company. Quickly determined the problem was not within my home. Did a check of the unit on the roof. Found the problem and was able to replace the part. Checked for temperature after replacing.
Explained the issue clearly. Helps that all was under warranty. .

Paul looked at my old water heater and confirmed that it should be replaced. He provided me with an estimate explaining the work to be done. I scheduled a date for the replacement. He arrived with Frank on time. The work was efficiently done. Couldn’t ask for a better experience. (Thanks!)</Text>

Marco was professional, friendly, and approachable. He answered all my questions  and reviewed all aspects of my hvac unit thoroughly. I will also say the pricing was fair compared to other companies I've used in the past. Most importantly, I have heat for the winter!!! Thanks Marco! You are an asset to JW Heating!< /review>

Great customer service.  Called to remind us that we have a service contract that covers two maintenance calls/year... and asked if we wanted a check up before the summer.  Service rep, Mark, was outstanding.  Prompt, knowledgeable, answered all questions, made suggestions for future improvements...  Will definitely stay with them.<//review>

We had a great experience with JW and their whole team. Originally we brought them in for a second opinion and due to a couple visits and creative thinking they got everything we wanted done for ~$4k (30%) less than a competitive bid.

JW Heating and Air did a fantastic job! We had a new AC unit installed. The access to the AC area was a bit challenging. JW’s crew showed up promptly and went to work right away. They spent close to 10 hours here to make sure everything was done properly. We are very happy with their expertise and the professionalism of their crew. We highly recommend JW Heating and Air.< /review>

Jacob was very helpful in figuring out what to do and WHEN to do it; after a thorough system check he gave me some options and worked with my situation. It was a great intro to a company that will surely get my business in the near future when I pull the trigger on an upgrade. Thanks for the great service!< /Text>< rate>

<Text>Installing a complete new AC/Heating system with new ducts involved practically every room in the house. Yet we were able to conduct our daily lives without interruption. The JW crew Shawn, Rudy & Christian were absolutely superb in many ways: Attention to details - punctual -  at the end of each day's work everything was clean - everyone was polite & friendly - they supplied bathroom with their own towel etc. - cooperated well regarding any concerns I had - knowledgeable -it was team-work at its best - contracted crane operator impressive! And last but not least I would like to thank Ted, who patiently assessed the work to be done and stayed in communication until the work was done.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Victor the technician was extremely polite, courteous & knowledgeable. He kept me informed every step of the way during the troubleshooting & repair process. The “Up Front Pricing” was quite comforting.</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>Had to replace the old ducts in my house.  Ted from JW came out to give me a quote for the work.  Not only did i receive a quote from him, he also told me that the company i purchased my system from may have installed the wrong equipment in my house.  And sure enough after a few phone calls i found out that they indeed installed the wrong unit in my house.  I received many quotes from different companies and had all types of technicians out to look at my system and no one caught this issue.  He didn't have to go that extra mile with me to help me fix my problem, but i am so glad and thankful he did. Fast forward to almost a year later finally cause that's how long it took to get the correct unit installed, JW did my duct work. The crew was very professional,  and was very knowledgeable. Explained everything that was happening during the instal, and once it was completed if something didn't feel right, they went right back up and made adjustments . So i am very pleased with the outcome. They will be doing all my maintenance on my system from now on.....thanks JW for a job well done.</text>< pictures>

Oscar, the comfort consultant, Ismael , Ramon and Luis were fantastic. They were so professional and respectful of both the house and my husband and I. They explained what they were doing every step of the way and checked with us to see if everything they were doing was OK. They left my place actually looking cleaner that when they first came. I would recommend JW Heating and Air to anyone looking for air-conditioning and heating services. It is hard to find that level of professionalism!!<//review>

it would be 5 stars based on quality of work and quality of the products alone.  but i deducted 1 star because of price.  not just one, but 3 different friends and colleagues told me that i could've done the same project for half the price.  not one, but 3.  now, that could be with inferior products and less quality work but that's a huge difference in price.  i loved the service and the products so much that i couldn't deduct more than 1 star even if it was overpriced.< /Text>

Upon inspection of the new motor, he decided it was not going to operate well and needed to be replaced. Considering the high heat today and ahead, he called JW for the search of a new motor nearby and found it. He picked it up and installed the new unit today allowing us cooler days ahead. I really appreciate how professional and concerning David and JW are in providing the best most complete work. They are on time, friendly, caring and professional.

<Review>I have been a customer of JW Heating and Air for several years. I have never had a bad technician sent to my home to do maintenance service on my A/C system. The latest technician Eric was very polite  and very thorough performing the inspection and maintenance of the system. He explained everything and like all of his peers he took the trouble to wear booties over his shoes while in the house. Great job everyone.</Review><user_id>102842375275938221555</user_id><gmapID>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1<//gmapID>< pictures>

<Review>I enjoyed working with the team at JW Heating & Air. Their technician performed a checkup on our HVAC unit. He was kind and took the time to explain everything that he did on the unit. As part of the process he tuned the blower's RPM to increase the airflow and took out some refrigerant because the HVAC was overcharged. Thanks to his work our unit will be running more efficiently than it was before. The service was covered through the LADWP HVAC maintenance program, which enables LADWP customers to receive an HVAC tune-up every two years. After the excellent customer service provided by JW Heating & Air we will rely on their team for HVAC maintenance moving forward.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1574453290344, 'text': "Wow!

JW Heating and Air is a great!  They installed a whole new system in my house (vents and everything).  They are extremely neat and tidy.  They answered every question I had and were polite and fast during the whole process.  Steve and Ramon were here everyday on time and worked until the job was complete sparing no detail.  Jeff checked in on the project and was very helpful along the way as well. I have already recommended them to people I work with and my own family.  Go with JW Heating and Air - you won't regret it!<//Text>

Couldn’t be happier with JW Heating and Air. They installed my HVAC two years ago and regularly service it. They did such a great installation, any work men who have needed to go into the attic say how good a job they did.  Michael, the technician who came for the maintenance checkup today was professional and a pleasure to have around. Even my dog licked him.</Text>

Aside from being punctual and courteous, Mike was especially wonderful in that he took the time to explain to me how the system works. Three cheers for JW Heating and Air.< /Review>

<Review>I recently had my heating unit checked for its regular maintenance by JW Heating and Air and wanted to make a comment on how happy I was with the service I received.  I was extremely impressed with Tony who was the technician for JW Heating & Air.

Tony's knowledge and his ability to make sure I understood what he was trying to accomplish on this service visit and I, especially, appreciated his explanation and breakdown on what was needed to help keep my heating unit in top working condition.

I feel Tony is a great asset to JW Heating and Air and I appreciate all of his efforts and thoughtfulness in making sure I was a satisfied customer.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1575569149097, 'text': "Wow Lorraine, thank you so much for leaving this incredible review!

we recently had a new heating and air conditioning system installed in our 1923 house by JW Heating and Air.  It was a great experience dealing with the entire staff - from our Sales Contract with Ted, to the team who did the work and cleaned up every afternoon.  The project supervisor, Art, was terrific - he was on site every day explaining what work would be done. The team members Alan, Ramon and Dennis were great.  We'd definitely recommend them  - and we love our new system..<//review>

Professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and on time. I highly recommend this company and they must
Train and treat their employees respectfully and fairly because that is how their employees treat their customers. I referred this company to a friend and she had the same experience. Thank you.<//review><user_name>Ellen Khokha</user_name>< rating>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Angel, the technician, was excellent.  He was on time for the appointment to service the HVAC system.  Fortunately, he detected a leak in one of the AC drain lines and noticed the lack of a safety switch.  He repaired the line and installed the switch during the appointment.  Angel alerted us to a problem with the AC condenser that presages a potential failure in the future.  He set up an appointment for me to meet with a salesperson next week.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Mario with JW Heating was very knowledgeable and professional.  I have done my own research so I was able to determine he knew what he was talking about.  But, unfortunately as a consumer I am always looking for the perfect deal.  We could not come to terms on pricing, so I am unable speak to the quality of the service that the company would provide.< /Review>

<review>We just completed a large project with JW Heating and Air.  We needed a new furnace, ducting, insulation, and in addition, we added an air conditioner and filter. I can't speak highly enough about this company.  From the thorough follow-up and knowledgable guidance provided by Ruddy throughout the decision making process, to the crew (Ramon, Raul and Felipe) who did all the demo and installation -
this team went above and beyond expectations.  They were efficient, considerate, meticulous, and extremely knowledgeable. I highly recommend this team.  They were truly a pleasure to work with.<//review>< Pics>

These guys are great. I will try and keep it short and sweet; If you have any issues with your AC system, do not hesitate: Call JW to get the job done. Our team showed up prompt, they were very professional and they explained the process all the way through. I am very satisfied with the service that they provided, and I highly recommend them.< /Text>

JW Heating & Air is one of the best companies I have done business with in a long time. After moving to LA a couple years ago, I had given up trying to find companies with solid customer service; it seemed every service company I had come out to my house for repairs or service either didn't show up, did a shoddy job, or had just awful customer service. But JW Heating & Air was very different. They were the third company we had come out to look at our HVAC system in our new home to give us solutions for inconsistent air flow between a couple of our bedrooms. The other 2 companies basically couldn't help us, and later we realized they gave us very incorrect information anyway, once we did some research. JW Heating spent the time to explain exactly what was happening with the way the HVAC system was set up in our home, and detailed various options of what to do about resolving the issues we were having.  They implemented the solution we opted for, and all along the way they have been terrific to deal with. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for good solid quality work and great customer service.< /Text>

<text>On May 1, 2018, we had the Spring tune-up of our air-conditioning (A/C) system.  Given that we had had a problem with a previous service last Fall, we asked JW Heating & Air to send us a senior member of their team.  Juan Sierra arrived punctually, explained in a friendly manner and in considerable detail what we could expect from our system in terms of service and repair, and then performed more than 3 hours of thorough service on our two A/C systems (one for each floor).  He ended by asking us whether there was anything further he could do for us before he removed the various protective tarps he had spread over our floors.  Juan was courteous, unhurried, and helpful in every imaginable way and easily won 5 stars for his visit and service.  We have owned two homes, one on each coast, and have used quite a few companies to service our heaters and A/C systems.  JW Heating & Air, which was recommended to us by a neighbor three years ago, is by far the best of these companies, both in terms of service and repairs.

5 stars for not doing anything!   How about that!   That means these are honest folks.  They couldn't find the problem with the furnace since it was intermittent.  But we had video of it not working.  But since he couldn't find the problem he said there was nothing to fix and he wouldn't charge us!  Any other place would have just "made up" a problem and replaced some part that didnt need replacing and charged a ton of money.  Not these folks.  That honesty and integrity go a long way and I am now going to be a loyal customer.  Sure it cost them some money to send the guy out,   but they will make it back when I have other problems they can fix or when the furnace craps out completely.  Thanks JW!<//Text>

I have had excellent experiences with JW Heating and Air and recently Cesar C. from the company replaced some damaged ducts from underneath my home. He arrive on time, worked efficiently and when finished, he cleaned up so you wouldn't know anyone was working in the basement.  He spread drop clothes to protect the floor and he corrected a couple of other problems not described in the estimate.  Great attitude, easy to talk to and overall a great guy and conscientious worker.  JW is lucky to have people like this on their staff.  He is always welcome to come back!< /review>

Many thanks to Shawn, Victor, Christian and Luis! Ted the sales rep went out of his way to make sure we were happy and all details were crossed off.

<Text>I chose JW after interviewing six heating and air conditioning providers. It was, by far, the best in terms of level of expertise and was informative and helpful. The installation of the HAC unit was impressive, even requiring a huge crane to lift the compressor to the location on the north side of our house. Matt Linden, who came to inspect the unit this past Tuesday, 3 April 2018, was polite, professional and efficient.<//Text><name>Steve Edlefsen< /name><Rating>5< /Rating>< Response>

<Review>I bought an HVAC unit from JW Heating and the unit had problems from the factory. JW took it upon themselves to replace the unit without me even asking.  Amazing service and they will stand behind the products they sell.  Impressive Service!!!<//Review>< pictures>

We had a new HVAC unit installed 12/16 had have been very pleased since.  JW has been very responsive to questions/concerns, and even helped get the energy rebate.  Today we had our first complementary maintenance visit for the heating prior to cold season.  Fernando C. was very friendly, professional, and efficient.  JW honored the first year complementary service, including a replacement filter, which costs $189.  Again, we have been so impressed with the service and support by JW, and would highly recommend to others.< /text>

< Review>
A week ago I called for service to check out what I thought might be a problem with my recently installed heating system. The service representative could find nothing wrong and left. A few days later, when I went to the basement where the equipment was housed, I noticed that the face of the heater had not been put back. Since it was a simple matter to do, I put it back myself. I also noticed water leaking from the heater so I called JW and told them the problem. They promptly sent out Victor D later the same day. He noticed immediately that the plug from the water pump had been pulled out of the wall socket and that was why water was leaking from the heater instead of going into the pump. He also took the time to explain various functions of the heater installation. Although I was disappointed in the prior service call and its result (i.e. leaving the pump plug disconnected and not replacing the heater face), my confidence in JW was more than restored by Victor's attitude, knowledge and general demeanor. Victor represents the best kind of service representative and JW should be glad he is in its employ.<//Review>

<date>1504455408156</date><Review>We are very happy we had JW Heating and Air-conditioning replace our HVAC.  Starting with David who knew what and how to check the old non functioning unit .   We made the decision to replace the unit without any pressure from anyone.  The work was done quickly and efficiently with all the necessary equipment to remove the old unit and replace it with a new unit.  The servicemen Jose, Christian, and Miguel were on time, courteous and efficient with the necessary knowledge to do a superb job.<//Review>< user>

Scammy. Called to simply ask what they charge per pound to replenish freon. This is not a trade secret. Not colonel sanders' recipe. And yet they refused to give me that info whereas all other ac shops were happy to: instead they offered to have a tech come for $99 to tell me how much they charge per post me of freon. That, ladies and gentleman, is a scam.</Text>

<Rating>5</Rating><text>I'm in the process of doing a total gut and renovation of my condo.  The team from JW Heating and Air installed new duct work and an air conditioning unit on the roof (new air handler and fan will be after the drywall is installed).

My experience started by meeting with Ted who worked with us to define the system that would best fit our needs.  He also helped us to come up with a duct solution that allowed us to relocate some ducts in order to raise a ceiling in the hallway and master bedroom area.  Ted was very courteous and always prompt in answering questions or meeting at the unit as we refined the design.  I couldn't ask for a better consultant!.

Shawn, Ramon, and Ignacio were our installers.  Phase 1 was scheduled for 2 days and they completed it on time.  All three team members were extremely personable and clearly knew what they were doing.  They arrived early both days in order to start promptly.  With a total gut of the unit, dust is bad.  However they wore "booties" when leaving the unit to prevent dust from getting on the hallway carpets.  I was doing other work in the unit while they were working and there was never an issue with me being there.  The installation far exceeds my expectations, and all debris was promptly cleaned up and removed from the unit throughout the work day and at the end of the day.

It was an absolute pleasure working with the JW Heating and Air team.<//text>< pics>

I was able to coordinate a slight time change in my appointment with the technician that worked perfectly and was much appreciated. He was professional, friendly and answered all of my questions after completing the 6 month equipment check up. It has been consistently positive in all interactions with the entire company and I have happily referred JW Heating and Air to friends. Thanks!</Text>

The crew of Shawn, Ignacio and Ramon was prompt, hard-working and efficient.  In addition to installing a new furnace, they replaced all the ducts in the attic and crawl space.  They were very pleasant and made the process as unobtrusive as possible.  Everything works great.  Ted analyzed my needs at our first meeting and we signed the contract that morning.  He also returned after the job was done to inspect the work and solve any issues I might have.  Very happy.</review>

My 27 year old a/c unit died and needed replacing.  I had a few people out to give me an estimate.  David from JW Heating spent the time to explain what would be the best options for my home.  A two-day job with a short 3 hour follow up and the system works as advertised.  Ismael and the installation crew did a fine job and kept disruptions to a minimum.  The attic is no longer cluttered, it is now tidy and efficient.<//Review>

<text>I  find it hard to believe that so many people have given this company five stars. Our experience is horrific. We called first thing on Monday morning to set up an appointment and we were told that we would have to wait until Friday for the repair man to come.  We were not happy about that but we understood that they were extremely busy and we were willing to wait until Friday.  However, they did not show up and we called numerous times on Friday to re-confirm and make sure they were still coming and they never came. We have an elderly person staying with us during a heatwave and now we have to continue to live without air-conditioning.  We received a phone call at 6 PM on Friday stating that they were not going to make it and that we would have to wait until the following week and take off another day of work to wait for the repair man</text>< pics>

Dustin called ahead, arrived on time, got right to the diagnosis and repair, kept me informed of what he was doing, explained what the problems were, showed me the worn out parts, priced the repair fairly, then when I agreed, replaced the parts with brand spanking new ones, and cleaned the entire unit. I asked about a maintenance contract, which he offered, and I accepted. Had not had one in a few years because I couldn't find a reliable contractor. Well, now I have!  I got to know him in the process, and learned quite a bit about the air conditioning equipment as well. Dustin not only repaired the unit and restored cool air on one of the hottest days of the year, he gained my trust and confidence, and a happy customer for JW Heating and Air.</Text>

I was looking for a heating and air company and came across this company because they had more reviews then any other company and more 4 stars then 3.  Well now I know why they have so many 4 stars. I am so glad I finally found a reputable company who is very professional and informative.  The tech was very professional and listened to my concerns intently.  Instead of charging me a price of what he thought the problem was, he converse with his supervisor and called me back to confirm the price and problem.  He was right and I haven't been cold or hot since.  Everything has been working like my heater and air should be.< /Review>

JW Heating was able to do the work two days ahead of original schedule. The crew arrived early in the morning and worked all day to replace all components of a heat pump mounted on the roof of our condo building. Not an easy job, given the cramped space housing air filters and associated gear. We are happy to recommend the crew and the company.< /text>

< Review>
Mario, the field advisor, was professional, courteous, gave his honest opinion, and explained things well (cost, best options for AC). I'd asked 3 other companies to assess our home for AC and none of them said they could do the job (our furnace and duct work is not amenable to regular central AC installation). And they said there were no options that would be entirely satisfactory.  At least JW Heating and Air gave us a viable option. They were recommended by our friend, who had them install AC in jos 1950's home. So they definitely can do the job! The cost, however, is prohibitive for us at this time.< /Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>Having a new HVAC system (including replacing all ducts and relocating some vents) installed by JW Heating and Air was actually a great experience. This is the first time that, from the initial meeting to the project finish,  everything I was promised happened. They finished on the specified day, no extra costs, the crew were very respectful of my house as evidenced by how clean they kept everything and there wasn’t anything left undone to be put on the list to finish/redo later.
It’s like working with a family that is very passionate about what they do and and is very proud of how they do it. It’s a little scary at first, then you realize they are real and BAM it’s over.
If only they would get into landscaping and flooring.< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>JW Heating sent Ruddy B to service our AC unit which has a history of working intermittently and Ruddy was able to determine we were in need of a new motor.

After finding he didn't have the right motor on his vehicle, Ruddy retrieved the right motor that same day and we have been enjoying  a cool house ever since.

We will be contacting JW Heating and Air for any of out Heating or AC needs in the future.</Review><gmapID>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1< /gmapID>< pictures>

< review>
JW Heating and Air is awesome and JOSHUA WILKINSON who performed the final hook-up of our brand new AC is the kind of technician you want to service your home.  He completed the electrical connections, checked-out all the refrigerant levels, and helped with the Wifi connections to our thermostat controls.  He was patient with our questions and took the time to make sure we were comfortable.  The experience was JW Heating has been positive from start to finish.<//review>

Marco did a great job with resolving the issues we were having with our Lennox iComfort WiFi thermostat.. He also did a comprehensive checkup on our current air conditioning system and made appropriate suggestions for what needed to be fixed, also providing photos of our unit so that we could see what was wrong that needed replacing. Very reasonable pricing as well. Thanks, Marco!<//Text>

Excellent service! Very professional -- every appointment was on time. Communications were excellent; schedule changes were notified well in advance. The crew that did the installation did a great job. They worked well together. Left the place clean and neat.

The job was the full replacement of a 40yo HVAC system in a two story town home. Replacement was with a new heat pump and air handler.< /review>

OMG I just needed to take a minute to thank JW Heating and AC for installing Central Air Conditioning in my home. We've had over 9 days of 90 degree temperatures this summer and my house couldn't be more comfortable. Josh and his guys were efficient, courteous and cleaned up after themselves everyday. Plus it feels good to support a local business and an Iraq war veteran. If you're reading this and thinking about installing AC just pick up the phone and call JW Heating and AC. You'll be glad you did.</text>

<review>The service was very thorough.

We had a mini split system installed last year, and it wasn't turning on.

Our technician Josh traced the problem down to wires that were shorting, causing the breaker to trip. It took him awhile to whittle down all the possibilities, and I'm glad he was very thorough at fixing it. Would highly recommend them. We changed to JW from our previous guys, and have not had a problem since.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>I had a problem where the condensation water didn't completely drain from the drip pan. Joshua came out a week ago and diagnosed the problem. The fix would involve adding an extra drain pipe which due to the installation (in an apartment) would take a couple of hours to install. We decided to reschedule the work for today, and Joshua came prepared with everything needed. He put plastic up on the walls and protection on the carpet in the area where he needed to work. It was a pleasure to see how careful and precise he worked, and when he was done he cleaned everything up so the area was as clean as when he started. JW office staff was very helpful in realizing there was a problem, and in their interest in making sure that it was taken care of. I'm so happy Joshua came out, and I give him my highest recommendation. He is really someone that goes the extra mile. Thank you!<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures></record></dataset><record>

<Text>My service call today was terrific. Joshua was obviously quite an expert on heating issues and figured out the problem quickly. David was also a giant help in troubleshooting the problem wires causing the problem. They were curteous and professional. They replaced my thermostat based on their knowledge of CA codes and double checked that my A/C was still working too after correcting the problem with my heating system. I would highly recommend both Joshua and David along with JW Heating for any heating/cooling issues in the future.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c794472eea93:0xd8ddc1680e0e94f1</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>I live in a small town in Cambridgeshire, England. I've just moved into a new house. Sadly the climate here isn't like that in California and so I've no need for air conditioning unit but if I did need one and I lived over there then I'd definitely  consider these guys. I just wish my American namesake would stop giving out my email address to companies who spam you constantly asking for feedback. :-) Peace xxxx</review>< Name>

After several attempts to diagnosis the problem with my dad's A/C unit, Joshua W. was knowledgeable and professional in relaying to us what the problem was and why we kept experiencing lack of cooling with our unit several times within a short period of time intervals.   He informed us honestly what would need to be done to rectify the problem.  He was pleasant, did not rush and truly wanted to do a thorough job. He sealed the coil that had a leak in it and informed us that it may or may not hold.   Since the problem was occurring way before our warranty had expired,  JW honored replacement of the coil that was causing the problem.  They pursued us in setting up an appt to do the work to replace the coil.  No sooner than the coil was replaced, we experienced dripping water from a crack in the ceiling.  Josh came out again and diagnosed that there was an opening in the drain pan that would need to be sealed.  He also cleared the over flow pipe so make sure it was clear since we never experienced water dripping outside the house from this pipe since the installation of the unit.  The overflow pipe had been installed flush with the wall of the house so that the dripping was now being directed onto the porch and wall of the house.  Josh had to be called out again to extend the pipe away from the contact of the house.  It is now working satisfactorily.  The company still has to repair the crack in the ceiling and we are awaiting resolution with that problem.  Throughout this entire ordeal we are so impressed with Josh W. and his professionalism as well as Denise in the office.  Denise would call us back during a holiday weekend and even when the office was closed during the weekend.  They were exceptional people to work with and we always felt that our problems and concerns were given immediate priority and attention.  We would highly recommend Josh W. as your technician and Denise as your go to person in the office..  You will not be sorry!<//review>

<Review>When LA felt like you were inside an oven, of course our air conditioner suddenly stopped. We called JW Heating and at first they said they were so busy (I am sure that was true) that they couldn't get to me until the next day. But, they called back and said it was possible to send someone out today. SO HAPPY> Victor came and quickly identified the problem. He took photos to explain everything clearly. And he got everything up and running again. He gave us options without being pushy for the long run and we made our choice. Thanks for saving us on a VERY HOT day.</Review>< Response>

<Review>Kenton L. from JW Heating and Air came to our home today to give us an estimate on replacing our outdated split HVAC system. We are still in the process of getting a couple of other bids before we make the final decision on which company to use, but I will say that Kenton was very thorough, knowledgable, helpful in answering all of our questions, and we understand why their reputation is great in the industry: we saw and heard a snippet of the experience in Kenton L.!  I will say that JW Heating and Air is definitely in the running for us. I will update my review if/when we should decide to use JW Heating and Air. Thanks for the great consult, Kenton!</Review>< GmapID>

He provided us to all the information we needed and helped us make the best decision for our new air conditioning and heating units. He explained all the options, sizes, warrantees, etc, showing us a pamphlet to help visually understand the choices. The other company we had come out the day before did not do this. Dustin was thorough. I will refer JW to all my clients and friends.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

This team sets a high bar for all professional contractors. Starting time at 7 am meant arriving early just in case with a well coordinated delivery of materials and crew. They were working by 7 sharp. In two and a half days they removed all the old ducting and furnace then installed a new furnace/HVAC  in the attic hanging from the rafters. Our home is approx 1700 sq ft one story and needed a larger intake and additional registers (thanks Ted for your expertise.) Craftsmanship was perfectly executed and cleanup passed the white glove test. Shawn was patient with our questions and explained everything clearly. The new Lennox variable stage is so quiet, this summer we say BRING IT ON!!!<//text>

Ted came out today to provide an estimate/proposal on a replacement Lennox unit on our rooftop.  I've already secured estimates from two other contractors and their prices were a bit cheaper in price but lacking in details and specifics.  I've had experience with contractors who would low ball price but would either make expensive mistakes in judgment or drown me with change orders that would cost me more in time and money in the long run.  Ted spent the most time at my house (3 hours!) to diligently research my situation, understand the issues and write the proposal onsite.  He also explained in extraordinary detail what had to be done and the menu of equipment options that were available.  Extremely impressed by his thoroughness and honesty.  I haven't made up my mind yet but my wife and I have a heavy lean towards Ted and JW Heating.</Text>

I had had HVAC service in the past with JW and was impressed by their professionalism and organized manner. The same technician returned to look at our furnace md system.  He was able to call one of his supervisors who came out on a Saturday morning to look at the system and give an estimate. Another tech came out a week before scheduled service to make sure they knew how many vents they were working with.  The morning of the service Ishmael and his team were at my home promptly at 7 am and began work.  They checked in often and when they realized all of our old ducting was compromised by previous work in our basement, they called Jeffrey who came by within an hour to evaluate and give a price for the ducting ( which really had been crushed and collapsed). They finished the main installation on time and came back promptly the next work day to co okeyw the ducting.  Throughout the technicians were courteous .  The office kept in constant communication via phone and email throughout the process from start to finish.  I am pleased with the team and the finished product< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Paul A. (marketing Mgr) The first face of JW. In all visits low key but knowledgeable and unflappable to my pre-hire demanding questions. Very courteous. No lag in replies to followup questions throughout process.The work-boots on the ground were more that just workers. They all seemed to work together and all were eager to answer or reassure us as the the process in progress, despite being in the midst of a very arduous task  and a dusty work environment. Overly concerned to homeowner's floors. Our crew of Joe, Adolfo, Gus, and Ricky were mindful of our questions and were non-stop in the stalling process. Cleaned our yard by watering away the fine dust and also sweeping. Their communications to us was neither impolite or aloof (as other professionals might tend to be). Joe and Adolfo particularly took their time in politely explaining matters while they worked---- as I was a constant overseer.< /Text>< pictures>

My AC died at the beginning of the 98 degree heat wave in LA. I have a contract with JW Heating and Air and so they squeezed me in 4 days after I called. I would have hoped for something sooner as my indoor thermostat read 87 degrees! But, OK, they were really busy. Ruddy checked my system and determined that I needed refrigerant (sp?) which he did not have readily available. He was thorough and I was very happy with his service. He even left me his number in case I had trouble before he was able to get back to complete the job. Fortunately, the AC has come back, although inconsistently and clearly needs the refrigerant. I am hoping JW will follow through next week, as promised.< /Text>

In calling Costco's third-party HVAC servicer, JW Heating & Air, I was very specific with the receptionist that I had already arranged to have Home Depot install my HVAC system, but would consider one last quote if JW could match or beat the price. I informed the receptionist that I needed a 3 ton Lennox heating and ac unit, insulation added, installation, and all new ducts (with permits) to be either $13,500 or lower. After putting me on hold for about 10 minutes, and speaking with an adviser, the receptionist guaranteed they could get close or beat it. Accordingly, I set-up my appointment with them hoping not to waste my time by another "car salesman".

Surprise surprise, when JW heating & air came to my house, it was $2,300 moreover than the quoted $13,500, and that was only IF I was a costco member (15% rewards card), executive member with 2% back, and had the costco Visa card with 2% back! I expected more from a Costco affiliated service!</text>

<Text>A.MA.ZING!!  From Ted's patience in explaining everything to me beforehand, to Joe and Fernando's care in removing my old heater and making sure EVERYTHING was in order with my new one, my experience with JW was nothing short of spectacular.  Even though it's been almost two weeks since the work was completed, I'm still in awe with just how easy and stress-free the entire process was -- simply put, the one and only time I've actually enjoyed working with a contractor ever.  I've sung JW's praises to everyone since and will more than happily recommend them to anyone who needs HVAC work done in their home.  Thanks, guys!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

I had JW Heating and Air install a new Lennox heating and air system in our home, and I would highly recommend their services, from Joe to Jose and his team, Ismael and Flipie.  Jose's team were punctual, friendly, and meticulous in their work.  Joe followed up and spent personal time to confirm the installation and answer some technical questions after the install.   At the end of each day they were very careful to make sure the work area was clean and no mess was left.

Overall the experience was excellent.  They delivered on everything that Oscar Villafana promised in our initial negotiation for the job.  They listened, communicated and performed.  All the special traits of a well managed and experienced team of employees.

Being in the Development and Construction Management business for over 25 years and hiring numerous construction trades/contractors to perform multiple technical projects, I would definitely put JW Heating and Air at the top of my go to list.<//text>

< Review>
Called to set up appt for estimate on ductless mini split system.  Was disappointed when told starting $$ 6500, regardless of btu, size, make, etc.  I questioned how could she determine the cost if she doesn't know how many zones, model, cooling/heating, etc  I might be interested in?    She then said JW only installs Daikin and does not install nor service any other system.  That ended my conversation.  She offered no advice   and left me feeling, why did I call?  Unfortunate for JW Heating Co.< /Review>

<Review>Very happy with the work and service performed by JW Heating and Air. We did a brand new installation of a package unit along with new ductwork, and they were so professional from start to finish. The company's warranty package is pretty impressive, which is so important when making such a huge investment.<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< gmap_id>

JW Heating gave me the best price on a full heating and air system.  The installers were professional snd fast.  They routed the ductwork so it was out of the way, and they were very clear in the work area.

I would highly recomend them.<//text>

<Text>About me, I'm a very detail oriented person who must have work done professionally, cleanly and accurately with great attention to aesthetic.  I need straight lines, accurate specs and it MUST LOOK GOOD.  My review is both 5 stars and 3 stars...thus I gave this company a 4.

5 Stars to Joe Howard and his team: Rene (carpenter/stucco), Gus, Miguel, and Adolfo (A/C install).  If you hire JW Heating and Air make sure to schedule Joe Howard and his team for the installation.

Joe is a hard worker, respectful, clean, easy to talk to and no-nonsense about doing a professional job.  If something is wrong, whatever it is, he'll fix it.  He won't try to explain it away.  He sees what you see.  If it's not professionally done he'll make sure to have it re-done and done right.

3 stars to JW Heating and Air because the first team they sent me.  Whoever did the scheduling sent a team who never ever came to my home.  I had to re-explain what was talked about with Joe Howard.  I was stressed the entire day and when they finished I found a ton of aesthetic issues.  And although that team was courteous and nice, they were sometimes loud and laughing while working.  They were a young team, did parts of the job rushed (there was a lot to do bc I never had A/C) and without concern of how it would look.  I had to act as my own contractor and constantly check on them.
At the end of the day there were things done wrong and that did not look good.   I was very unhappy.  On top of it all I was paying a lot of $$$ and I was stressed.  It's not right to be paying so much money, be put in such a stressful position and have to work as my own contractor.  When I hire a professional company I expect them to do the entire job, do it right and make sure I'm happy for the entire process.

On a positive note - JW Heating's Kris - who takes care of the rebates is on top of things and I really appreciate that they took care of all rebate processing for me.

And at the end of the day, I was very happy with how the job was completed.

The Bottom Line - Make sure to have Joe Howard at your walk through and make sure the scheduler knows you must have him.  Even if you have to wait another week or two.

Thank you Joe Howard and Team!

I highly recommend JW Heating and Air.  We completely replaced our furnace, AC unit, and all ductwork.

I met with 3 HVAC folks and was very disappointed with them.  They all immediately sized the system without doing the Manual J calc, based on my home's square footage.  I knew from my research on the web that this is completely wrong.

I turned to Angie's list and found JW Heating and Air had over 1,000 A ratings, and figured we'd try them out.  Ted Ceausu from JW Heating and Air was great to work with. Very professional and before he left, said he'd be doing the manual J calculations and then room calcs to figure out the amount of air-flow and duct size we would need in each room.

Woohoo!  I didn't even need to ask about it!

Their cost was right in the middle between the lowest and highest bids I received.  But everything Ted said, was great. We have a home built in 1936, and he is experience working with other historic homes and provided us a vendor for reproduction grates that he was able to include in our quote.

But it's really the attention to details that made all the difference.  Since antique style grates have much bigger openings, he let us know that they would spray paint the inside of the registers black to ensure we wouldn't see any silver metal when looking inside.  This compared to my neighbor who said that when she asked her HVAC installer to do the same, he said his job stopped at the installation. She had to paint her own.

The crew was all very polite and they kept our house very clean as all new holes needed to be cut for all the registers as the existing ones were too small or not well-placed.

Best of all, when the state inspector came, he said our 5-ton system was the best he'd every tested as far as leakage, at 4 1/2%.   Avoid any contractor who doesn't want you to get permits or inspections.  Paying for that is like money in-the-bank over the long haul to insure your systems was installed properly.

We've had the system for two weeks, and so-far-so good with the AC.

Again, JW Heating and AIR is the best!< /review>

Jeff and his team are a simply fantastic and I could not recommend them enough.  We got a number of bids from different places.  We wanted a complete HVAC system and we wanted to best brand for our home.  We also wanted a mini split for the back, and I also wanted the best brand for this.  Jeff’s estimate was not the cheapest, but very reasonable, and his bid felt the most thorough and honest.  He spent over two and a half hours at the house, looking around the attic, and the entire house.  He made his suggestions, and talked us through what would take place.  He said it would take about three days—btw, one of the bids told us it would take one day, which I see now would have been impossible).  They were removing all of the ductwork and replacing it with new ducts everywhere, installing all new vents and creating a brand new vent, moving the AC to the roof, an putting in an entirely new furnace in the attic, and creating an up to code drainage system.    Anyway, Jeff communicated clearly what our options were and he assured us that we would be taken care of.   We ultimately went with Lennox for our HVAV and a Mitsubishi mini split for the outside studio.

Jeff called me the night before the job to tell me that he was upgrading my Lennox from a 3-ton to a 4 because his load calculations revealed my house needed it.  And he was picking up the extra cost.

When his crew arrived it was like staying in a 5 star hotel.  You don’t have to worry about anything.   It was at least 6 guys.  Also, they are very smart.  While they were in the attic, they even noticed some hazards that they alerted me to, which I immediately addressed.  And each person worked hard, efficiently and they took great care of our house.  NO MESS.    Jeff was popping in and out to make sure everything was being done well.  Our house was not an easy install, but they never complained, at least not to us.

In summation, I would go to JW Heating and Cooling before anyone.  You won’t get better.  These guys covered everything and I am thrilled.

Thanks Jeff,
John and Gaby</Text>
