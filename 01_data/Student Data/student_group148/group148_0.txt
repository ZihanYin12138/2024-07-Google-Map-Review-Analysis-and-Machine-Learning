Did not end up taking Ethan on as my attorney, but I had consulted with him to consider changing attorneys. Ethan was very professional and did not sugar coat anything, he addressed to me that I was merely dealing with the MAJOR flaws in WC system. He had even went to ends of assuring me with my current attorney( I just have not actually spoken with my attorney and has been rough getting in contact with my caseworker) that he was advocating for me in the best possible way. If you’re looking for a honest attorney that will look out for your best interest don’t hesitate to call.< /review>

From day 1 of me first speaking with Ethan, he took charge and began to fight for me, for my rights, and everything I deserve. So humble and always personable,They always kept me in the loop and updated on everything. I never had to question any move or decisions they made on me behalf. I felt as if I was their only client because they dedicated so much of their time, focus, their hard work, and fight to get me a good victory. I could call them at anytime and they always answered with no hesitation. I felt safe secure and well protected with them defending me. They have been the very best team to have my back and defend me where I’ve been wronged. Choosing their team will be the best decision you will ever make.< /review>

Ethan did an excellent job of navigating me through what is already a difficult process. He was always available for any questions or concerns that I had and I would recommend him and the firm to anyone who asked. The process is long and stressful, but Ethan and Visionary Law Group definitely made it easier. Thank you to everyone for your hard work and dedication. I couldn't have done it without you.<//Text>

I want to acknowledge and share many thanks to Ethan Pease and his team for representing me in a work related injury. For over three years, Ethan fought hard and we were able to reach a favourable settlement. He was attentive, supportive and professional during the entire process. I am grateful for his support and journey we experienced. Highly recommend.</text>

<review>Unfortunately I had an accident at work and had retained legal counsel who did absolutely nothing for me after 3 months I still hadn’t seen the doctor . I decided to reach out to Ethan Pace and after a free consultation I decided to hire him to represent me and no joke once we signed I had a scheduled doctor’s appointment the next day ! From then on everything went smoothly and not to mention fast Geraldine and Jennifer and the rest of the team that Ethan has working in his office always were polite respectful and caring. I definitely recommend anyone and everyone who is in a similar situation to retain Ethan Pace as your attorney, trust me you will be doing yourself the biggest favor ever !< /review></record>

Ethan Pease did a great job working on my case. After going through many workman’s comp lawyers who turned me away, Ethan always believe in my case and took it on confidently. He was very professional and didn’t cut any corners. Being very nervous as a 22 year old, I didn’t know what to expect... && Even after I moved to a different city, he didn’t force me to come to the court dates and drive 2 hours to get there. The case took just under a year to achieve a settlement, and as soon as he received the cashiers check he rushed it to me as quick as he could. I always felt in the loop and if I was confused he answered all my questions.  I definitely feel like this company does not try to cheat you out of your money and you can have confidence that they will do everything they can to provide justice for you. I feel grateful for envisionary law for helping me to feel compensated. Thank you Ethan for being so generous and straight forward with me and my case.</Review>

He really fights for his clients and ensures that we are taken care of.
He had a case with my husband that recently passed away and we thought his case would close and we wouldn't get anything.
He went out of his way to make sure we were taking care of.< /Text><Resp>None</Resp><date>1582439122347< /date>< UserId.>

I am incredibly grateful that I had Attorney Ethan Pease and Visionary Law Group representing me with my Workers Compensation case.  The insurance company was not pleased with the results of my Qualified Medical Examiner's report and its disability findings.  Ethan fought hard to get me a very good settlement, far better than I would have been able to negotiate on my own.  I give him my absolute highest recommendation.</review>

I was very pleased to have some peace of mind knowing my Attorney and his associates always had my interests in mind. They were able to explain the process thoroughly knowing I’d never been in this situation before. There were times I felt like throwing in the towel but Mr Pease assured me I indeed had a legitimate claim and regardless of my decision to move forward or not he would honor that.

Mr. Pease, took on my case without hesitation and explained to me the process up front. His updates throughout the process were timely and relevant.
I would highly recommend Mr. Pease to anyone seeking legal representation that is fair, honest and will keep your best interest and unique needs at the forefront. Should the situation arise, I would not hesitate to seek
representation from Mr. Pease again.
GREAT, SMART AND HONEST ATTORNEY!!!
Thank you Mr. Pease.< /Review>

<Text>All I can say is that I am very happy and thankful for the Visionary Law Group!! You won’t understand until your going thru it but after a tragic accident at work I was tricked into a scam by my former employer. Two years had passed by and he kept on making stories about taking care of my medical bills even after receiving and showing him the collections mail that kept on stacking up. I FELT HELPLESS WORST FEELING EVER because no one wanted to take my case. Even after other law companies with their slogans saying “ if we can’t do it no one will” they denied helping me saying time had gone by and weren’t able to help me. I’m talking about numerous of law companies claiming they are the best couldn’t help me. One day I found Ethan online with Visionary Law Group. I explained my situation of how others denied my plea for help and he told me “ I dislike employers who mistreat and lie to their employees and abuse the good heart that one has. But he’s there to help me.” I couldn’t believe that he was willing to take my case even after 3 years. I was able to get the medical help I needed and let me tell you Ethan works miracles! It’s like if he’s destined to what he does! He’s amazing! If your in a bad situation give Ethan a call. I promise you that you won’t regret it!</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80dd2d71d7dfaad3:0xd71103831fda6791< /Gmap_id></record>

<review>Dealing with Ethan has been a very satisfying experience.  He took on my case when the big law firms that say, "we'll fight for you" wouldn't fight.  He got me to the right doctors and was able to get me a nice settlement from the company, medical firm and insurance company.  I would highly recommend Visionary Law Group and Ethan for any of your legal needs.< /review><username>AJ Johnson< /username>< user>

The insurance company had already been hard to deal with and basically didn’t care about my wellbeing once I hired Ethan things started to happen even though the insurance would drag their feet not answering calls and everything they could do to make anyone throw their hands up Ethan would make sure I knew what was happening and got things moving all the way up to negotiation of my settlement. I would really recommend using them if you Have a work injury and need help navigating the system. I wish I would have hired them in the beginning.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
After being in a work accident and dealing with incompetent work clinics and insurance companies I was referred to Ethan Pease from Visionary Law Group, Ethan  explained to me how the employer was not looking for  my best interest so he immediately sought out treatment for my injuries, on top of that he was able to negotiate a very fair settlement on my behalf. I am very satisfied with the outcome of my case and I would highly recommend Visionary Law Group, Ethan delivers nothing short from excellence.<//Review>

<Review>SUPERD JOB!!!
Mr. Ethen Pease,
I could not be more satisfied with the outcome of my case, you understood my pain, concerns, and situation. You did what you promised me; I would definitely recommend you to friends, family, acquaintances, etc., for legal representation.
And Thanks  again for such an outstanding job.
God bless,

<review>I was injured on the job and had several questions I met Ethan who helped me answer several of them, I did not report all of my injuries to my supervisor because they might of retaliated against me.  Ethan said he will take care of it and he did just that and I would definitely recommend his firm and also Chris who is also a friendly and knowledgeable guy,</review></record>

This was a year ago. 2018 ...but now..2020

honestly, i don't know what happened to this place.
This is the service you get after paying $ 600. My request was .... "there is an oil leak in my car, please check what can be". As an answer I was told that there were 3 small leaks and then, when I was charged $ 600, they delivered the car to me like this, still with leaks.
Furthermore...
1-Terrible front desk guy service.
2-The same promised to repair the car on the same day. he didn’t keep his word and didn’t even call the customer to let him know
3- When I was there to pick up the car, he did not care to show what was changed, like opening the hood and tell the customer about the service performed.

Tip: If you really want to work with customer service, make sure you are prepared to do this job, otherwise, find another area.</text>< Pics>

Had my Jeep towed in for a clutch, a water pump and a radiator that I thought were going to be under warranty. Only the water pump was covered but the clutch was still under warranty from another shop. Aaron was amazing! Very professional and helpful and understanding. I'm definitely using them again if I ever need any work done!<//text>

Brought my car I had just recently purchased to be inspected by Aaron as it was purchased as is. Not only did he not charge me for the inspection, he also went above and beyond and did a second one when I brought up something else I had noticed. Clean bill of health and I will be back for any future repairs. Honest, friendly, knowledgeable. I will recommend all services here. Thank you guys.<//text>

<Text>I had taken my 2002 Ford Thunderbird to McCoy/Mills Ford Dealership in Fullerton, Ca. for transmission service. After I got (?) the service done I noticed a small leak under the car. I returned the car to have it checked out and was told the leak was coming from the transmission and rear. I wanted a second opinion so I called AAMCO. Aaron, the manager said to bring it in and they'd check it out, free of charge. I took the car to their shop and explained to Aaron what had transpired so far. Later in the day I received a phone call from him asking if I said that I had just had the transmission serviced. I said "yes" and he told me that no-one had did any work on the transmission in a long, long time, if ever. He even had photos taken of the transmission case that showed the bolts covered with dirt. To make this short I just want to say that Aaron did fix the oil leaks and did everything needed to keep my car running like new. Not only that but he did it at one quarter the price the dealership wanted. Aaron definitely has his customers as his number one priority. If you want great service at a fair price go see Aaron at AAMCO.

I have a good trust in these people for many years and they have always helped me with transmission repairs. Though there may be many shops offering the same, nothing like AAMCO Transmissions. I would recommend them as their technical team can fix almost anything for your car.< /Review>

I visited them when my car’s engine was causing a lot of problems, as my car was too old. I was seeking for an engine replacement. Their techs are skilled professionals. They did their work with great efficacy. They were friendly to communicate and did the task at a fair price. Highly Impressed!!!< /review>

They are the only service providers I trust completely for my car servicing and repair. Recently got their service for engine repair. The technician who worked on it was experienced and did an amazing job on it. My car is working efficiently after his work on it. Dependable services.</text>

Things in life can be stressful,  mainly car repair.
But my experience at aamco in garden grove .ca was wonderful.
My car gave them a challenge, but they  aced it!!!
And all the workers there are incredibly knowledgeable and very very nice!!
My total stay there was lengthy in time, but they keep keeping me posted on progress and even offered me a ride if I didn't want to hang around in the shop.
Most definitely will use these guys for every little thing my car needs.
And I'm spreading the word to all my friends and family.<//Text>

I'm an actual customer not a paid review writer. All staff were honest, pleasant, and very helpful. They explained everything in great detail and went above and beyond to help me. Hank even picked me up and shuttled me to get parts. The shop is clean and organized and they did the repairs right the first time. There are very few repair facilities I would recommend but this one is first on the list. Thanks guys!<//Review>

My first phenomenal experience with a car problem happened here, at AAMCO. (A rare occurrence in this day in age). These guys are trustworthy, and gain their client base by being honest and hard working. For once, I had the technicians trying to save me money, instead of scheming up ways in which to put more money in their pockets. I was given a quote on my brakes and rotors, and the specialist laid out on the table, all of my options. They explained to me, in thorough detail, what I would be getting instead of pawning me off to selecting the option most profitable for them. They insisted that I go with the most economical model and followed up with me to see if this was indeed my final decision. Before they made any adjustments, they wanted to make sure their client was most aware of what they were EXACTLY getting. They even offered to do a full inspection on my vehicle (when i had only gone in for brakes) and found that my frame was bent. As much of a travesty this was, they went out of their way and offered to tune up, and tighten my bushings, in order to lessen the effect of the bent frame from deteriorating the other parts. They were blatantly truthful in the situation and had informed me it would be best to leave the vehicle as-is, and to refrain from dumping any more money into the car. If you want a trustworthy company for a vehicle repair, and not have to worry about being bent over backwards and taken advantage of, AAMCO is your solution. Detail oriented and absolutely reliable!! I will be coming here for ALL of my future vehicle maintenance, as well as refer all of my friends and family to this place (even if it means driving 45 minutes to get there)!!!!</Text>

I was visiting the Long Beach area of California a couple of weeks ago and realized someone tried breaking into my car destroying my car lock. Having such great experiences at the Aamco in the Portland area, I went to Aamco in Garden Grove where I met Andrew. He was the hospitality I had not yet experienced! Andrew took my family and me right in and took care of us. Even some of his mechanics came into the waiting room to offer any services and sympathy for our first day bad luck. Thank you Andrew for your kindness and amazing service! It was our pleasure to have met you and I wish there was a way to repay you. Definitely a job done above and beyond.< /text>

Such an amazing group of honest individuals. Had a rear end completely rebuilt for a fraction of what I was getting quoted elsewhere. I was there when they opened up the rear end and I watched gears fall out in pieces. I thought the worst case scenario of the highest quote I got,  but the guys at AAMCO saved the day asks my wallet. Thanks for putting the customer first.< /review>

Amco Quoted to me $900 to remove and install a torque converter on a Silverado 2-wheel drive for just the labor with no parts!? Hahaha  Wow What a rip off he said it's going to take 12hrs of labor and he didn't check on his computer or anything he just made a random number of the top of his head...Changing a torque converter doesn't take 12 hrs specially on a 2wd Silverado. Most shops say they rebuild and install a whole transmission and torque converter installed for 900 bucks. Go to a real transmission shop they don't even know how to troubleshoot transmissions they don't have the equipment. Cheap shop I wouldn't let them touch my vehicle they don't know what they are talking about< /Text>

{'time': 1480460820526, 'text': "Dear Julian,\nI am so sorry that you are not completely satisfied with us.\nAs you know, we sometimes have to rely on others in order to perform our repairs, for instance, to resurface the flywheel  we have to send it to a machine shop, and be at their mercy for a fast delivery. Or sometimes parts are delivered and they don't match, and so we have to return them. Not to make any excuses, but we received the authorization to work on your car at 2:30 pm, the flywheel was sent to the machine shop the same day, and we received it at 10:00 am the next day. Our quality of work matches or exceeds that of a dealership when it comes to clutches, and transmission, our prices though are less than theirs based on OEM parts.\nafter market parts are a different story altogether, and their prices vary greatly.\nPlease, consider giving us another opportunity, so that we can do our best to give you faster service without sacrificing the quality.\nSincerely,\nHank\nAAMCO Garden Grove"}<//Resp>

I have a new clutch in my Mustang GT and they did a good job on installing it as far as I can tell after having it for a few hours, however they really overcharge here and they had my car for 2 full days when they told me on the phone that they had nothing going on when I delivered my car to them at 10 am... it took them until closing to actually look at the clutch so that I could know the exact problem(s) and figure out my financial situation. It cost me 1300 and two days without my car to have a standard clutch, flywheel, and bolts redone which should have taken half a day not two full days.. a decent aftermarket clutch was quoted to me at 3000 in total... insane...good work and mostly honest people but if you want to overpay to wait around this is your spot</Text>

Would have given it a 5 stars, but the pump island is way too narrow in the middle. Almost scraped the car already there when I was pulling in to the empty side of the center. And they need a Dino Statue! 🤪</text>

<Review>This place usually has the cheapest gas, but the pumps to get gas are really close together so it's always been a bit tricky to pump. Plus it's always got cars so it's tight to fit next to one. They do sell scratchers again and carry a variety of items in store. The restroom stinks, but most do I guess. It's easily visible from the street and are open till later.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Very good place for photo and video equipment. It's kind of hidden if you haven't been there before. But it's like finding gold since you'll be hard pressed to find any other good rental place in the area.< /review>

Andrew and crew is always more than helpful and accommodating. I will continue to use them for all my rental needs...<//Review><name>Ed Hannigan<//name></record>

Really Sketchy. Their website doesn't work. Their prices are too low to seem like a legit business, and their phone (whose number is located in San Bernardino, not Pomona) rings and goes straight to a voicemail.</text>

My roommates and I's favorite Thai restaurant we’ve ever been too!!!!! We don’t even live in the area anymore but still talk about it years later.

1.Pad Thai out of this world, they use the round noodles instead of the flat ones.

2. They don’t play around when you tell them 11/10 spicy 🌶.

3. Service was so great that we actually felt bad after we moved and didn’t say our farewells to the staff<//Text>

<Text>Really good Thai food!  I had the red curry and it was amazing. Rich, creamy and they make it super spicy, if you ask!  Really excellent service, friendly wait-staff; very attentive, but not overbearing. A really chilled out, excellent experience.<//Text>< pictures>

Delicious food and the whole staff was so nice. I came for the first time because a friend recommended this restaurant. We had so many questions for the waiter, yet he was so polite and answered all our questions. We ordered appetizers and I explained to him that my daughter was very hungry and he put the order right away and for that I was so grateful for his help. We definitely enjoyed everything 😋 thank you so much.< /Text>

Wow!!! Excellent Thai food and perfected cooking techniques. I would bring all my friends and family here. Unlike other places the chicken satay was not over cooked or chewy but grilled to moist perfection. The seafood Tom yum soup is excellent as well as shrimp silver noodle and yellow curry. I was very impressed with the high level of service too. From the outside you may not think this place is so excellent, a bit hidden in a small strip mall but once you find it it’s like finding a gem. Enjoy it and I’ll see you there!< /text>

Fresh vegetables make the difference in a place like this. It's not difficult to think of, but difficult to pull off. These guys do it. It's a great place for the classics and soups. So good.< /Review>

My first impression was a bit iffy because the location and sign doesn't reflect a modern vibe but that quickly changed once I stepped foot inside. The atmosphere is really cleanly & neat with plants near the entrance and spacious seating.
The service was really friendly and attentive despite  English being their second language. They were really communicative and there if we needed them.
I ended up getting the padseeew with tofu and although their tofu was magnificent I found the rest of the plate to be a litttttle toooo oily. Usually it's a good thing to have moist pad see ew but some parts of my plate had tiny pools of oil on it. Although the first 10 bites were really good I avoided the areas with a lot of oil.. I really loved the atmosphere, service, drink, and 75% of my food ! I'll probably come back to see if it's just inconsistency but for now my review rests at 4 stars because of that :(</text>

<Time>1520148890286< /Time><rate>5<//rate><text>I am so glad the previous restaurant I contacted this evening gave me horrible service or I wouldn't have found THIS restaurant tonight. Thank you to the person who answered my call and took my take-out order.

You were kind and gracious when I called at 9:30pm, suggested I also try the Garlic Green Bean (I ordered with fried tofu), even though you were closing at 10pm.

There was a different person that readily welcomed us when we walked through the doors at 9:55pm. Our food was ready and as we were waiting for the payment transaction to complete, another person asked if it was our first time there. I asked her if I had spoken with her on the phone, and she said it was her. How wonderfully attentive and friendly is she?

Zero complaints and tons of praises on our meal below:
Pad Thai (chicken)
Cream Cheese Ragoons
Crying Tiger (beef)
Garlic Green Beans (fried tofu)
side of steamed rice

Um, we almost finished everything, except for some Pad Thai I saved to eat at work tomorrow. ^_^

We will be coming back here again. :)</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Great local place with friendly staff and yummy food. I've been here several times now, I've sampled several curries and noodle dishes  as well as the soups and appetizers. The food has been consistently great, we'll seasoned and expertly prepared. The staff are always very welcoming and friendly, and I always feel at home when eating here. If you're in reseda and craving some good food, come by and check them out.</text>

Having worked in Thailand for more years than I'll admit when home I still am looking for a carbon copy of what I get on the streets of Bangkok or Chiang Mai. The atmosphere is not rurual Thailand but has a friendly Me. Jay and tangy chicken wings and smooth panang Kai.  All worth tasting. I'll be back. Thanks I'm almost there.</text>

Chutamus has become my go-to spot for good Thai food. No matter what I've ordered there it always tastes great. The wait staff is friendly and takes the time to come and chat tableside. The next time you're in the mood for Thai I recommend giving Chutamus a try.</review>

The waitress with the cool haircut was super welcoming. My food came 10 minutes after being sat. They also have the best "Thai Tea" as well. I ordered  their Calamari, which was very delicious!</text>

This is by far the best Thai food I've had. I good there at least once a week for the chicken wings and drunken noodles. If you don't like your food too spicy they will tone it down. They make mines mild.  And they are so friendly.<//text>

I don't know what it is about this place that even the water tastes great. I know, it is freshness. Since day one, I have admired their kitchen philosophy which is fresh is always best. I come here often and try a different dish every time and I have yet to be disappointed. A staple for my family is Tom Yum Koon (shrimp and lemon broth) another of my favorites is Tamarind Fish, the burst of flavors out of that dish really stands out. Recommended as well, Tiger Beef, I have never tasted anything like it. Kids favorites chicken Pad See Eew.
Hands down the best Thai in the Valley. 5 stars does not do it justice if you combine the amazing service from the owner, to the best waitress, Vee. Family owned and operated.< /Text>

<Review>Everything we had was tasty, 4.5/5; .5+ for being family-owned and great service. I came in for dinner on a Friday night with family and ordered the Beef Jerky, Garlic Green Beans with Beef, Chicken and Shrimp Tom Kha, Panang Curry, and Crab Fried Rice. Each dish was made with care and so flavorful, couldn't stop eating even as I got full!

Crab fried rice used actual crab and the crab was all over the rice. The beef was seasoned amazingly (not too salty, which can be an issue at places trying to appeal to American tastebuds). Their approximation of the spiciness level in their food was average/fair: medium for curry had just a tiny kick; medium for tom kha was mostly mild--so if you like tom kha spicier than that maybe get spicy. I also had to try the Thai Iced Tea, which was very rich.

The place is family-owned and so far the food does show that care and authenticity. I really hope they do well. The ambience isn't anything notable negatively or positively either way--the spotlight is on the food which is what matters anyway...

I am hoping to come back and try more dishes. I would recommend this place if you like classic Thai food, and Thai food that isn't just lathered with sweet sauce and doesn't skimp on the quality ingredients.<//Review>< pics>

This is the place with true to its existence. No frill. All real basic reflection of where it is for - serving the community of Cambodian immigrants. I can fine everything that I need to cook a day-to-day Cambodian foods. They are all good with fair prices, which is why they are doing well.</Text>

<Review>The Riverside Supermarket is a one-stop shopping marketplace. It sells most of the basic Khmer food supplies and ingredients. It is located in the center of the Cambodia Town (across the street from the Long Beach Transit Station), offering convenience and enjoyment for both the (would-be) shoppers and people with curiosities about the Khmer cultures and ways of life.<//Review>< pics>

Our local pool. Newly remodeled bathrooms and changing rooms. The rest is pretty standard. Salt water/chlorine or bromine mix, so easier on the skin. Nice way to cool off for 5 bucks</text>

This pool is fabulous!  They use salts other than Chlorine and they use solar energy.   The schedule is on line.   The other swimmers are friendly.<//Text>

<review>Great pool. Open year round for lap swimming. Not too cold not to hot.
(Goldilocks zone)
Located in Ives Park with a nice softball diamond, good barbecue area and playground for kids. Also has free concerts

My grandson needed private lesson after years of group. I requested assistant and received immediately phone call from Luna.
She was very conscientious and he loved his lessons.< /text>

< review>
Ives is a nice pool but local families have always been disappointed with their limited open swim hours for families and general use. Even during open swim they still keep half the pool roped off for laps and this isn’t a very large pool. The drinking fountain on site seems like it’s from the 70’s and barely works. They only just installed an outdoor shower after all these years. There is very little shade to speak of. There is only a couple tables to sit at for such things as parties yet they have a large vacant lawn area. The snack bar can barely be called one. Considering it is the only public pool in Sebastopol they should really try to cater more evenly to the general public who just want to have fun in the heat of summer at their neighborhood pool. There is not a very welcoming feeling there. You always feel like they are doing you a favor by opening for very limited hours and months during the year for open swim.  The summer open swim hours start way too late after the heat has begun. The pool rules are also excessive and strict. Our family as well as many others more and more have to drive to Santa Rosa for a truly Fun pool experience. A very sad state of affairs for all the families dying in the heat of summers in Sebastopol.</review>

1. Located just at the exit from highway, they serve fresh prepared Indian curries.
2. A little costly for the quantity but the taste was good.< /review>

We chose to stop here instead of a fast food joint because we wanted to support a small local business. the gentleman who served us was incredibly kind, all smiles, we ordered chicken tikka masala each, 1 naan, and 2 orders of rice( make sure to order rice because the main dishes don't come with). The food was delicious, no bells and whistles, just really great food. we would definitely eat here again if we didn't live 4 and 1/2 hours away.</text>

<text>Reading all the awesome reviews we were very excited to eat here, but……
1. It’s a food truck so nothing but a single table out under the tree
2. They took too much time & when we reminded they seemed to have forgotten our order. A wait of 40 min!!
3. The food was just blah ….. dal makhani was too thin, chicken tika masala was ( sweetish due to cream, I guess)
4. Samosa chat- the chole were tasty but samosas had a thin crust & the filling was yellow potatoes ( not authentic enough for an Indian, anyway
5. Nans are basically maida rotis with yeast. So none of that tandoor toasty crunch n softness & taste

For a food truck it is good, I suppose but food wise many restaurants are more authentic. Also for the setting& quantity it was expensive.
Overall we had a bad experience.( not their fault  that it was a 110 F) & I lost my appetite with all this  coming together for a ‘perfect storm’< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x54d2eb14b3c38cf1:0x98dfcd187963d49e<//GmapID></record>

Oh. My. Lord.  This place is stellar.

The food is out of this world. We had samosa + chole, and it was made in a chaat style. The samosas were hot, crunchy on the outside, and the potato filling inside was richly flavored, and not overly spicy. The chole were good, but the chutneys were the real clincher. Absolutely divine.

We also had some naan and palak paneer. The saag paneer was made with sarson (mustard leaf) saag, a little light on paneer. The saag was divine, just flavored right, hot and aromatic. Since this is a food truck, the naan was closer to rotis, but still very flavorful. You could close your eyes and be transported to Punjab.

Not only was the food amazing, but the hospitality was generous. After the meal, I asked the owner, "How much should I pay you" (in Hindi), he replied back in Hindi, "Give me whatever you thought that was worth." I haven't had such a warm experience in some of the best restaurants, let alone in a humble food truck.

This place is a gem. If you find yourself on I-5 heading North or South: do yourself a favor and get their samosas. If you can, thank the man for his oasis of flavor in a world of franchise restaurants.

The exterior is basic, the seating is a single portable table and four rickety chairs. Yet, this is among the best Indian food I have eaten in all of California: and that includes all the popular North-Indian restaurants in the South Bay and Los Angeles.

This place is a revelation. You can't judge a book by looking at the cover.<//text>

<Review>Was driving through Redding on my way to Paradise from Chiloquen. Grabbed the Veg. Samosa & Chole plate because I simply couldn’t decide on what to order. I had the feeling that whatever I ordered would be incredible, and I wasn’t let down. Washed it down with an exquisite cup of chai. The gentlemen working were kind and quick. If I ever end up in Redding again, I’ll be coming back, and until then I’ll be sharing this spot with anybody i love, because they deserve something this delicious, too.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Really good Punjabi food where you dont expect. Its right off I-5 entering into Redding and a great pitstop while traveling from Bay Area to Mt Shasta or to Oregon. The food had a home like taste and quantity was ample. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for Punjabi food in that area< /Text>

Had lunch here on a drive north and this place is 100% worth the stop. Had the chole masala/samosa plate and I cannot stop thinking about the chole masala. It was so flavorful and tangy, I wish I had the recipe! I'm literally making chole masala right now because I want to have that taste again.<//Review>

I think it’s the best in town. Very authentic and I hope this little Indian place can survive this rural area. Delicious and served hot!! It’s “run down” in appearance and fair prices. Trust me folks it’s worth it. Good luck to these guys trying to run a family business. Thanks for the deliciously spiced and tempered just right lunch!</review>

<Text>This is the best Indian flavor in whole of California. We tried vegetarian curries, they are all awesome with taste and freshness. While visiting mount shasta or portland this is a must stop for all indian food lovers. It’s located right across the I-5 towards the Redding Airport and adjacent to the TA stop. This is a small cart run by two elderly punjabi men. Must must visit for yummy and authentic indian food.< /Text>< pictures>

The best Punjabi dhaba type food I've had outside of India! We were passing through and chanced upon the Indian food truck, and decided to take a break. Warm, courteous service, hot yummy foods, and the most original 'canteen' chai I've had in a very long time. I'm game for driving 3 hours from home to have lunch some weekend again! Wishing them the very best in their business!<//text>

I found out that there is a Punjabi Food truck near to the airport with 5 star from almost everyone. So I went there and order a Thali ($12) with Chicken Tikka Masala and Daal Makhni which came with one naan (I ordered 1 extra naan) and good quantity of Rice. I also asked for a samosa chat with chhole ($7). The food arrived in less than 10 minutes, it was hot, fresh and amazingly delicious. If you ever had Dhaba food in India, this place will give you a similar vibe and taste.

Food  = Delicious
People = Amazing
Service = Great
Price = Inexpensive

If I ever go through this road again, I'd definitely try other dishes from this great little place.</text>< Pictures>

Say balle balle to this amazing food truck, because the food ordered was lipsmacking. Chole is out of the world- never like I tried even in india. Paneer butter masala is so yummy that I can't describe. Rotis remind u of Amritsar. We enjoyed the meal ending with a lassi sized chai.< /review>

<Text>We stopped by this place on our way back from Mt Shasta. We ordered the following items and here is the review

Samosa chaat with chole - 3/5 not the worst but not the best. The skin was decent and so were the potato fillings. Not your regular samosa. The cholay were decent.
Chicken tikka - 1/5 it was a disappointment. Chicken was dry and lacked flavor.
Dal - 5/5 this was the saving grace of the meal. Tasted like how you get it at home. It was wholesome
Aloo parantha - 4/5 this parantha coupled with dal was the best combo
Garlic Naan - 1/5 not really garlic naan. More like garlic powder sprinkled on naan.<//Text>< time>

Amazing indian food. You get surplus amount of food for the price you pay! Delicious and fresh samosas, chicken curry and naan! You must stop by this place if you are passing by I-5 or if you are craving some good Indian food!<//text>

<Review>One of the best meals I have ever had in my life. All I can say is wow. The people at this little food truck are super kind, I have never had Indian food before but I was blown away by the taste of the chicken tikka masala and the basmati rice. The naan bread was hot and delicious. I would recommend that anybody who wants to try home cook Indian food experience this place. Thank you to the owners.< /Review>< pics>

Stopped by on my way to Shasta Trinity National Forest. Ate their chicken tikka masala in order to fatten up before the planned hiking. Worth stopping by for the experience- the food was authentic Punjabi.</Text>

A great reprieve from fast food while on I-5. The hospitality of the proprietor was heartwarming when he offered us complimentary chai as we waited for our food in cold December weather. The food cart Itself is old and dilapidated, but the food is tasty, and the bread (roti) is made after you place your order. The daal and saag are authentic in taste and will be a delight for veggie lovers.</Review>

Customer service was great , well priced , no BS , straight up , got the call back on cost tl repair both my 22s due to nasty pot holes..within the same day.....10 days later....i picked the hottest day to pick up my wheels but well worth it. They even mounted my new rubber band tires too.
Thank you WRS definitely will be back if I need services done.< /review>

Incredible service, incredible prices, incredible communication =  incredible car repair experience.  These guys are the only choice in my opinion for wheel repairs.  Had a crack in my AMG wheel and repairing anything on these things usually cost 2 fingers a toe and 4 quarts of blood.  Not here!  Thanks fellas!</Text>

The turnaround time ended up being a little longer than planned, but I am absolutely stunned with their work. The finish matches perfect to the original OEM look. Pricing is well affordable and well worth it. These were originally beaten genuine Ford junkyard rims taken from a wrecked 2003 Crown Victoria LX Sport. Now fit on my 2005 Crown Victoria P71.<//text>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>I found wheel repair specialists through a friend of mine. My rim had a 2-inch crack and was unbalanced. The main guy looked at it and provided me with a quote on the spot. the fix took about 2 hours to do which is great because a lot of places take it to a third party shop for fixing but they do this in house . The cost came out to $150 which is not bad compared two other places that you have to wait a couple of days because they use a third-party company. The workers are really friendly and knowledgeable. I will definitely bring back my rims with any future issues.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

<Review>Tim at WRS is the go to guy who will make it happen! My experience with Tim and his staff went better than I had expected. All appear to be very knowledgeable efficient and do great work at reasonable prices. They repaired two of my BMW 19" M rims making them look brand new again.
I have already recommended WRS to several of my clients who also have high end vehicles and we're very happy with the results.
These guys are the best in the business!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I dropped my car off here today at around 10:30am, but was told that my rim could not be repaired and they would have to track down a replacement part, so my car wouldn't be ready until tomorrow afternoon. As you all well know, it's a pain to be separated from your car in Orange County, especially if you need to figure out how to get to and from work in the meantime.

But, the rim specialists to the rescue! I received a call approximately 3 hours later, with the staff telling me that my car would be ready for pickup in half an hour: they were able to find a rim faster than expected. I'm off to pick it up now :). Big thanks to these guys for being so diligent and reuniting me with my car a full day sooner than expected!<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>These guys are amazing. I took my aluminum Advan rg2 wheels to several shops to try and get some curb damage repaired. Everyone told me they were a lost cause and that I should just get new wheels. Took it to OC wheel repair and jeff told me he can't promise anything but we can get close. That was good enough for me LOL but when I got the wheels back I was amazed to see them. it was as if nothing had ever happened great job guys thank you for everything< /Review>< Response>

<Date>1535489706152</Date><rate>5<//rate><Review>Extremely happy to find Wheel Repair Specialists! My Mercedes AMG aluminum wheel started to have a wobble at speed. Hard to believe it could bend but it did. Every shop tried to sell me a new set of wheels. The WRS staff was able to identify the problem and true the wheel while I waited. Frankly the wheel runs better than new. Great service.

I highly recommend them and am taking my wife's Audi Q5 in to have the wheels 'cleaned up' from curb scrapes.</Review>< Pictures>

Nick who manages the front desk and phones is exceptional, and although they were not able to repair my wheel, they assisted me in finding another rim and sent me to some guys who were able to help me out.

<review>VERY DISAPPOINTED!!
Had a repair made to one of my wheels and WRS made the mistake of spraying the entire wheel the wrong color.  They told me that they couldn't get the color any closer which basically ruined the wheel.  To make matters worse, I had a buyer for the wheels that backed out due to the mistake made by WRS.  Who is going to buy 4 wheels when one doesn't match?  I asked Tim for a solution however he said there wasn't anything further that they could do.  I would think that a reputable business would fix their problem at all costs since it was their mistake.  I asked for the cost of spraying all the wheels the same color so that I could get them sold however Tim said it would cost over $500 (That is more than a replacement wheel for the one they painted the wrong color).  I would think they would offer a solution to either replace the wheel since they could not fix their problem or make it right with the other wheels.  I am now out a $1000 sale of the wheels and would be lucky to get $600 for the set since the buyer would have to refinish them.  WRS should have stepped up to the plate and offered a solution for this problem.  They didn't so be careful.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Do not deal with them !!!!
I have my E92 BMW, I was moving to San Fran and I wanted to fix ONE small crack on the left rear wheel, I went to this shop for a wheel repair, he convinced me that the wheel has 3 cracks and they will coast me more that a new wheel !!!!!!!!! And because I was moving and I wanted to drive the car all the way to San Fran, I just got the new wheel from his shop !!!! And less then 3 month I got like 3 inches crack and I found out that it’s not a new wheel and he didn’t want to fixed AND he refused to return the wheel or to refund my money !!!!!<//review>

Quite large laser tag maze with lots of space to hide and snipe.  Even at 100% capacity, there is lots of room to move.  The sensor vests and guns are a bit on the heavy side, but my 7 year old had no problem going the full 15 minutes.  There are a few video games, foosball, and 2 air hockey tables.  So not much else to do in the facility , but right around it, there is a food court and a Yogurtland downstairs. This location is very clean and not too loud.<//review>

I have ordered from here many times and I love the breakfast. But today I was very disappointed in the service. I came in to look at menu I was going to eat inside. I stepped out and and came back standing in front waiting for my order to be called at the appropriate window that says (PICK UPS) only. Two men walked up and started ordering (at the wrong window) so i walked back inside to ask if my order was ready. The lady (may have been in charge) told me pick up order outside at the pick up window. I calmly explained the two men that where still ordering where at the wrong window. She said "oh ok well you can pick up outside. Wow I and my family have been coming here for the past 9 years and never had a issue. I will and my family will not spend another dime at J B Burgers. Good food horrible service.<//Text>

Something is different here. The past few times I've ordered the food is not the same. Not sure if they have new owners but I always loved the fried zucchini, today not so much!! They used to be long crispy and good.... now short soggy and NOT GOOD!! Normally I love JB but today I regret spending my money.<//Review>

I remember coming here growing up as a kid. Being with my family and friends, we always enjoyed the variety of dishes they offered and could actually cook. Food was always great and still is. Thank you J&B Burger for still being around in 2020. That's what's up.< /Text>

<text>Dig this: Today, Sunday Aug. 30, 2020 , my first time to JB on Myrtle in Monrovia. It was 90 degrees and I walked back to the shop to get more Avacado Sauce and they wanted $1.00. I said no I will return the food.
Beware everyone only enough sauce for 1/2 a taquito.
So I return the food get my $10.20 back.
I think they should give a large sauce for the taquitos in the first place.
SO, the point is: Instead of giving me the large Avacado sauce for free, they refunded my whole order and I went across the street to eat.
Maybe, just maybe it would of been wise to give me the sauce which was probably a cost of 3 cents or (five) 5 cents, a nickel.
Instead it made more sense to the ladies to refund my full order of $10.20 over 3-5 cents.
Just sayin....<//text>< Pics>

<text>This place has one of the best charbroiled chicken sandwiches in Monrovia. Also a popular place for breakfast—most folks have the pancakes or breakfast burritos. Since they serve breakfast all day, I got a side of hash browns with my sandwich instead of the fries. Fast, friendly service and easy parking. Also, they accept credit card.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmap_id>

This place has been here ever since I can remember! It has always been good it's always been a place that's packed bcuz they have good food from burgers to tacos to pork chop dinner plates. If your a Monrovia native more than likely your going to run into someone you know here. Its especially busy on fridays when the Monrovia street fair is going on. You see all age groups and families in there. It's a cash place but they also have an atm there on the inside. There's 2 entrances one on Myrtle ave and the other one is on Olive which is the back entrance.</text>

Other than that, JB Burgers is like most other "greasy spoons" - a great place for a quick bite to eat.</Review>< Rate>

I have grown up here in Monrovia and lived on Olive st. I would walk here after school. I have brought my children to j&b. I have come to J&BS for over 20 yrs. I am applaud how I was treated when I let them know my chili cheese fries were dry and had hardly any cheese. Tina was very rude with an attitude. Customer service just isnt what it use to be. I came from Pomona where I currently live and look forward to eating at my hometown spot. I even come out here in the weekends just to get a breakfast burrito and their green salsa. I will not be getting their chili chese fries here any longer. It doesnt taste the same like before! The chili is watered down. It just doesn't taste good any more! I was very dissatisfied with the food and customer service!! Tina is rude to customers and is not a very good preparer for food!!<//text>

Breakfast and lunch are amazing! We travelled here for business and found this breakfast on our 2nd to last day and it is mere dollars more than the commercialized fast food breakfast and sooooo much better! We WILL be back when on any future business trips! Thanks y'all!</text>

<review>We had breakfast there last Saturday, and we had a good experience. The people are friendly and you'll be served pretty fast. There are a few tables inside and two outside (perfect spot for a sunny day). The food is good and generous, best part of it being the price, it's very affordable especially considering the good quality of this little family friendly place. It's cash only though, so make sure to have some when you go there :)< /review><resp>None<//resp>< pics>

< Review>
I am boycotting this place because they want to charge you $1.00 more to change from coleslaw to a salad when you order a dinner. Its THE PRINCIPLE of the matter. Lettuce is Lettuce.  I had been going to this restaurant for well over 35-40 years. They never charged to change. One day the owner was there and she is the one who tried to gouge. I said oh no. NOT TODAY. Just cancel my order. So she lost like $8.00  for $1.00 greed. My 77 yr old mother likes the place but until they change that rule I will not order for myself. I use to visit at least 2 -3 times per month. Oh well< /Review>

I ordered a bacon cheeseburger combo from here and it tasted delicious!!! When I arrived, the cook was already cooking up some bacon and it made the visit even better. Friendly staff, but be ready to pay with cash! That's the only reason I gave this place a 4-Star rating due to not being able to pay with my debit card. Luckily they have an ATM inside their store... What a coincidence. Nevertheless this place is worth visiting because the food alone makes up for the inconvenience of not being able to pay with your debit card.<//review>

<text>I went here to grab a BLT with egg for breakfast- there was my big mistake. The eggs sit out on the counter, not refrigerated. I ate my sandwich and not 20 minutes later, I was sick as a dog. I got salmonella poisoning. I couldn't stop throwing up and, I beg your pardon, but it was coming out the other end too. I ended up going to the emergency room, where I stayed for several hours. I was prescribed anti-nausea medication and anti-diarrhea medicine. It took me a week to get over it. I'll NEVER go back to JB's again.<//text><Resp>None<//Resp>< rating>

Still the best place for breakfast and their burgers are historic.  Make sure you get a side of their secret sauce so you can dip your fries in it because it is so tasty!</review>

Typical "Jim's" style burger. Breakfast burrito and sandwich are great bargains. I especially like the bean and cheese. A cut above other similar places if only for their reasonable price.</text>

<review>I can't believe this place, they specialize in everything from breakfast to dinner. And it's all great. Do yourself a favor and swing by, especially if you can figure out what you want to eat.  The pastrami sandwich is out of this world and they even have old fashion fried tacos.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

JB's is my new go- to breakfast choice. My egg special (3 eggs cooked perfectly, hash browns, and toast) cost less than mocha from Starbucks and faster! Great food, great service, and amazing prices.<//text>

Google online showed close time: 11pm.  Walked in at 9:45pm, ordered, paid, then asked 'here or to go'....I said "here" and the cashier's response was 'well, we close in less than 10 minutes'.

Well, that answers that.  I said "in that case I have no choice make it to go."

I will not be returning.  I cannot come back to a place that is quick to take your money and in the same breath so quick to kick you out.

My wife and I spent out $20 and ate outside in the parking lot.

The steak burrito was ok.  My wife didn't care for it, but I finished it for her.

My chile fries were not aweful.

We tried this place out, but will not be back.<//review>

Went to J&B on the Fourth of July.  The cashier was pleasant, the fries were fresh, and my sons liked their food well enough.  However, the cheeseburger they served had to have been sitting under the lights for hours.  The bun was so hard it snapped like a crouton when I broke it in half.  Anyone can make a mistake, but whoever put that burger up there knew it was ancient and inedible, so I just threw it away without bothering to request a fresh one or ask for a refund.  I wouldn't dream of going back, but hopefully others can avoid a possibly unsafe food establishment while they work out their issues .

mistake, but there is no possible</Text>

Why would a business that sells food leave both of their doors open at 8:30 in the morning? This place had more flies than a petting zoo.<//review>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>Great food. Tables need to be cleaned more. More like a diner atmosphere. Good customer service. Needs some air flow because ut can get stagnant and then you have to fight the flies if you sit inside. They have outside tables but no umbrellas so it can get hot eating outside. Good breakfast prices. Great burritos. Great huevos rancheros. Dine in, patio dining and you can order inside and theu have a walk up window. Basic tables. Casual atmosphere. Variety of foods..lots of men order food here..breakfast, lunch, dinner..dont bring the girl your trying to impress here unless she is your BUD. Great for big families on a budget, high school kids, and single people.< /Review>< Pictures>

This place has decent food. We eat here often. The only issues are that the cashier's have bad attitudes almost Everytime we come here and the food really isn't that good for the price. The best things here are the hamburgers and the pastrami sandwiches.<//text>

Breakfast Burritos are the best, just call in order and pick up. Orders are usually ready in 10 minutes.
French toast is also another favorite</review>

When I got there 20 min ago there were some ants crawling beside the vase on the 3rd table on the left. I ended up moving on the right side of the place. The taquitos were ok but the guacamole was watered down</review>

Food is good, but not always consistent, during the week they use restaurant platters but use plastic wear, on fridays they use disposible plates and also dont alow you to use the restrooms, not even if you are a child< /review>

I ordered a rather semi big order and they made a huge deal b cuz da lady couldn't understand English properly. They didn't give me everything dat I ordered even after I asked them 3 times "r u sure this is EVERYTHING"??? I called them wen I gott home and she gave me attitude saying y didn't u check da order... Lol 😏 da food waz ok but not bomb enough to have me go back and deal with people's attitude if I don't have to... 2 🌟 only b cuz the food waz actually tasty but I rather eat at a nudder burger stand!!!< /Text>

Rude staff, charge for peppers, steak and potatoes stale, probably a month past expiration. Unless you want explosion disease filled diarrhea, avoid this place at all costs.<//Text>

Classic burger spot with breakfast and mexican dishes too. Not a terrible spot overall but I have noticed their prices getting higher and their portions getting smaller over the years though</review>

(Translated by Google) Good place for amburgesas but today look at an employee using cleaning chemicals and during work hours something can fall into the food or intoxicate someone I do not like what I see I hope the owner adds something so they do not add that in hours open can contaminate the food sprallo above the campaign and that does not roast because below opened amburgesas I hope this looks at the owner and add something or the silence ..... THANK YOU
