I place an order on the drive thru today and the wait was too much and when I arrive home it was not complete and coming back was not worth. I will pay more attention next time or choose another location....< /text>

<Review>The regular chicken tasted wonderful. Just as I remembered. We purchases 3 different $5.95 boxed meals and a cake. Dinner was easy to serve. To clean up. And everyone was happy.< /Review>< Pics>

The chicken was really oily and the service was awful. The staff was very disorganized and I was missing one of my side orders. Do NOT go to this location as you will be very dissapointed.< /Text>

The first time I went there. They forgot my macaroni! I called, and they told me to come back.  I came back and I told them to give me everything fresh. Everything was fine. I get it maybe an accident, because I work in fast food also. But I went there again and the lady only gave me 6 packets of ketchup for 50 dollars worth of food! I got home and the chicken was so old and greasy. It was so old the bones were mushy. I just thru away everything. Never going back there again!!< /text>

The customer service was poor. I asked for napkins, ketchup, plates and spoons when I ordered a large family meal over $50.00. When I got to the family gathering 3 miles away, there were only 2 hot sauce packets in the entire bag. Nothing else.  I ended going to Stater Bros and buying plates, spoons, napkins and ketchup. Hopefully KFC management sees this post and improves on customer service.<//text>

<review>Very disappointed. Went through the drive through for my order. When I got home my order was wrong and missing an item that I was charged for. I tried calling over the phone but no answer, phone kept ringing and couldn't even leave a voicemail.
Pretty much ruined dinner for my kid as she didn't get her mac and cheese.

I  went through drive through placed my order told it would be a 5 minute wait after I paid was asked to pull up and wait. 12 minutes later i decided to go in there were 3 workers i was ignored when i got their attention no one knew i was waiting nor what my order was.. when I  finally got my order it wasnt made right  needless to say after 30 minutes of waiting for food we didnt get to eat or ENJOY it at all< /review>

Drive thru was super slow.  Employees seem to hate their job. I dont think its the area though. Ive been to other fastfood near by and got better service.  Food was cold(chicken).  If i die from food poisoning please tell my mom i love her!  I was asked if i wanted ketchup and never got any dayum.  Thanks alot<//Review>

Love dining in here. Laura is so sweet and courtious. Always gets our complicated order correct and food is fast and always on point. We eat in at least once a week... Anette-Fleur De Lis Furnishing ⚜️< /text>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>I've been to this location 4 times in the last few months, and 3 out of the 4 I've been disappointed and annoyed.  I don't know why I keep giving them another chance. The employees here do not listen to your order or pay attention to you l, the last time I felt as if I was bothering them. The food is fine but the people running this location are not worth my time.< /Review></record>

I have to agree with all the other reviewers.  People there are kind of serious and I felt not really helpful.  I bought a family deal (8 piece) when I get home i only had 2 drumsticks and 6 thighs, which I think they are cheating you.  I love drumsticks and I had to just settle for the thighs .It should have been 4 and 4.   I won't come back for sure.<//review>

Fast friendly service with drive through, i don't suggest going in and eating because of the dirty dinning area, but I do love the chicken pot pies, the worst part with the chicken pot pies, if they don't have any ready you have to wait 20 minutes, that's a bummer when you want a fast take out.</Text>

Can't say enough about how great the experience was working with New Autos Inc on purchase of a new Ford Transit Van.  I sent my request to them and by the end of the next day they had found a vehicle that met all my needs.  Had it by 5 days later.  The pickup process was great also.  Signed papers, and took the car.  No pushy salesman pushing add on options.  You tell what you want and they do their best to find it.  Just great customer service.  Thanks guys!< /Review>

When you work with Bernie you really get the feeling he's 'on your side'. Bernie helped me buy a used Porsche 911. It took me a few months to get my act together and he was super patient and kept in touch with me every few weeks (whereas others would have assumed I wasn't going to follow through). He also remembered nuances and details I had forgotten. Highly highly recommend.</Text>

I wouldn't go anywhere else to purchase a vehicle.

Best new car buying experience I've ever had, buying for 50 years. Noah was very knowledgeable with getting me a 2019 Silverado. Answered all my questions, found me the best deal, and in a few days I walked out with exactly what I asked for.< /review>

I just purchased my second car from New Autos Inc. and  couldn’t be happier. As always, the price was lower than anywhere else, the service was on point and the effort required on my part was very minimal with no pressure in any way.

I won’t ever buy a car anywhere else! Bernie and his crew are honest, super easy to deal with and I trust him completely!

Looking forward to my next, and largest,  purchase with them next week.</Review>

We bought a 2 year old car from out of state, and sight unseen, paid for it a week before it arrived. Bernie said he would stand behind it's condition and quality. The car was just as we hoped, in excellent condition. His service was without a hitch. I doubt there is an easier way to buy a car and at a good price.<//review>

I have heard of New Autos Inc a few times around town and had seen their license plates, but never gave them much thought until my parents had bought a truck from Ken and absolutely loved the experience. Within a few weeks of my parents purchasing, my fiance and I were in the market for a new Subaru Outback and had been doing some online shopping and pricing it out. But like some people, I was avoiding going into the dealership because I really don't enjoy the a salesman all over your every move, and having to run in the back room every time you make a offer on a vehicle to check with "the man". My Dad told me to give Ken a call. I called Ken and instantly his knowledge of vehicles shined through, he rattled off all of the questions about the Outback to pin point exactly what we were looking for over the phone in under a minute and I instantly had the feeling that this guy knew vehicles. I went into his office to meet him about an hour later and in that time he had the exactly model picked out we were talking of and all we had to talk about was the price. After all of my research online, Ken had the vehicle come in below what I was expecting to pay against the invoice price and below my monthly payment price, and all we had to do was pick out a color and wait for delivery. He even was able to show me what the "average price paid" range in our area and where we were going to fall into that spectrum, and yes, it was the very bottom end. It was really that easy. We put the money down and Ken said our new car was on a truck bound for California and to expect it within a week. A week later, we came in, signed the paperwork and drove home happy. I recommend New Autos Inc to anybody in the market for a new vehicle, it is a true no hassle buying experience!</Text>

Ken couldn't have been more AMAZING to work with! As a first time car buyer he made the whole process really easy and enjoyable. I simply let him know the truck I was interested in and Ken found me options to choose from within a couple days. He was able to get me a great deal on my trade in, and I couldn't be anymore happy with new new 2018 Chevy Silverado! All the paperwork was in order and it took the pressure off of me. I really love my new truck, it's made driving fun again! I'd recommend Ken at New Autos Inc. for all your vehicle buying needs. Thank you Ken I can't thank you enough!</Review>

I had a great experience buying my 2005 Honda Element from New Autos Inc! The car was in great condition and you can tell they sell only the best. The buying experience was so easy as well. I will definitely be recommending them to anyone interested in buying a car!< /Review>

I would recommend New Autos Inc and specifically Ken to anyone looking for a used vehicle. We were in the market for an older Toyota Tacoma as the new ones are bigger and higher than the '98 we were replacing.  This was by far our best experience buying a vehicle whether new or used.  No pressure or hard sell. I was dreading the process. They have such high quality vehicles they sell themselves and Ken was up front and truthful in a honest sincerely manner.  He delivers what he promises and doesn't promise what he can't deliver.  Dealing with New Autos Inc will change the way you feel about shopping for a vehicle.My husband is very happy with his 2007 Toyota Tacoma!!!< /Review>

<review>They make buying a car as simple as possible! I didn't have to haggle with a dealer. I didn't have to find a ride out of town to (hopefully) get the car I wanted with my busy schedule. And I likely would not have found such a great car in my budget on my own. Thank you Ken!</review>< date>

We just bought a 2013 Nissan Leaf through New Autos Inc.  The experience was very good and hassle free.  We feel that we got a great deal with no "salesmanship games".

It was also nice that they deliver the car right to our home.

This is the second car we have bought through New Autos Inc.

I highly recommend this service.< /Review>

<review>Purchasing a new car can be a daunting task! Especially at dealerships where the process is frequently frustrating and intimidating. Not so at New Autos, Inc! I simply walked into the showroom with a list explaining exactly what I wanted in a new or used Ford F-150 pickup. Tony wrote down my requirements and began researching his sources. Within a day he found a couple of trucks that fit my needs. He assisted with finding great financing, expediting the paperwork and delivering the truck in two days as promised. There were no attempts at “upselling” and no recommendations regarding options or other enticements. The price was very fair and no “bargaining” was involved. This is the best car buying experience I’ve ever had!</review>< user_id>

<Text>I was referred to New Autos Inc. by a co-worker and to put it mildly I am very thankful he recommended them. I had shopped around and their prices are unbeatable, and equally important they value consumers' time. My start to finish process was extremely fast and effective. They were honest, which if you have been in the car shopping business, can be a rarity. Lastly, they were sincere about selling me a great vehicle at a great price. I am very grateful to have them here in Chico so when I buy another new vehicle I can go straight to them. They are by far the leaders in the industry, awesome, awesome, awesome!<//Text>< Pictures>

The best car buying experience I have had! I talked to Tony on the phone twice and that was it, a few days later I went down and picked up the exact truck I ordered, everything was ready when he promised it would be.  It doesn't get any better than this. These guys really know their business. Thanks, Tony</Review>

<text>We recently purchased a 2013 Honda Odyssey from New Autos Inc., and were absolutely thrilled with our experience! Our salesperson was patient AND understanding when we changed our minds (regarding the model we were interested in purchasing) several times! When it came to negotiating a price, Jeff got us a great price, and delivered it the NEXT day. Thank you thank you New Autos Inc. We will never buy a car from anyone else!

<review>By going through New Autos Inc, we were able to get a 2014 Toyota Prius V for a lower price than any of the other dealerships in town, without any haggling. Ken was a nice guy who answered any questions I had. Two days after I turned in the car we traded in, I realized that I left a CD in the CD player, so Ken went and got it for me and had it waiting on his desk when I came to pick it up.

The only reason this is four stars instead of five is that when our car did not arrive on the scheduled day, I did not receive a phone call. I contacted Ken the next day to ask whether the car had arrived, and it turned out the car was delayed several days due to an issue at the dealership that was selling it. It would have been nice to receive a phone call or email letting me know, since we were planning to pick up the new car "within 24 to 48 hours" as we were told by New Autos Inc.

Overall, I would recommend this company and would do business with them again.</review>< name>

< Review>
My experience buying my BMW from Bernie and James was awesome.  Bernie talked about the car and helped me set up the deal over the phone so that all I had to do was drive it when I got there!  James was very well informed about the car and even put it up on a lift for me to view on my test drive.  James went out of his way to explain everything about the car and answered every question I could think of. These guys were great to work with and made my buying experience easy and fun!

Thanks again

<Review>Great car buying experience.  No hassle, no haggling, no having to deal with car dealerships.  Ken Kirkman, our agent at New Auto Inc took care of all of that.

I want to thank everyone at New Autos Inc. for the outstanding service I received when selling my car and buying a new one.  James was very helpful and kept me in the loop regarding the arrival date of my new car.  He also assisted in getting my navigation system up and running--which was much appreciated!  I have recommended New Autos Inc. to several friends!< /Review>

We were able to communicate exactly what we wanted and Ken worked hard at finding the exact vehicle - down to our only color preference. It was that effort that we truly appreciated. We look forward to enjoying this vehicle for the next 10 years. In addition they were able to secure the vehicle for the best price (even lower than the Costco Auto program).

We will definitely recommend NAI to friends and will start with them first for future purchases.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

I have bought 5 cars totaled and buying through NAI was the best experience I’ve ever had! Brian was GREAT to work with! Brian guided me through the car buying process, advised me through price points, and even emailed me the online owner’s manual to my Lexus RC 350. I would highly recommend buying your next car with NAI and through Brian!</review>

We shopped around at several dealerships, in person and on-line.  James with NAI was extremely patient as we decided what we wanted, provided answers to all of our questions, worked with us without being pushy.  When we ordered the vehicle, he kept us informed to its process.  The preparation of our vehicle when we picked it up, was better than any of the past purchases we have experienced. We loved our experience and the car.<//review>

<text>By far the most pleasant car buying experience - My husband and I went in and met with James (who was very friendly and helpful). We told him the car we wanted,  and within 2 weeks we had it! No stress, no negotiating. Met with the owner Bernie to pick up the vehicle (which took 20 mins. to sign paperwork and have our keys in hand), and couldn't have been more impressed with a business owner. This company has it figured out- respect for the buyer- no pushy salesman at this car dealership!

<review>New Autos Inc made the whole car buying process a breeze.  I'd been dreading going to the car dealerships and having to deal with the salespeople and haggling, until I heard about New Autos Inc.
There was no trying to sell you on any one particular car that they had on the lot, they would find exactly what YOU wanted, and for a price that couldn't beat any dealership.  Would highly recommend this place to any future car buyers!</review>< Time>

We just bought our very first new car, and going through New Autos was the best decision we could have made! We worked with Ken and he was great. We talked to him over the phone to tell him exactly what car we were looking for, and he found it that day. That same day we filled out paperwork for financing through Toyota, were approved the next day, and the car was brought up here the day after that and we drove it home. We spent a total of 1 hour and 4 minutes between two visits to their office, and that was it! We were so happy to not have to worry about trying to haggle with a dealer to get the best possible price, they do all the work for you! We will recommend New Autos to anyone we know looking to buy a car, and will definitely use them the next time we need one ourselves! We cannot say enough great things about them!</Text>

We have purchased 4 cars through New Autos Inc., and in the process of a 5th.  Tony has been very helpful in our journey to find just the right car for our family, not to mention VERY patient with our requests.  The car buying experience has been very pleasant and hassle free through New Autos Inc.! I honestly don't know why anyone would want to deal with high pressure salesmen elsewhere!</Text>

<Text>Dan and I just completed our third purchase from New Autos Inc. in Chico.  They treat you like royalty and make spending more than we paid for our first house not feel so scary.  Bernie the owner is great and never got tired of our calls or our questions.  So to me there is no better way to buy a new car.  They will beat any price and save you several thousand.  I gladly recommend New Autos Inc. to all of my friends. You literally cannot go wrong.<//Text>< userid>

<Text>I talked with Bernie over the phone a couple of times over the course of 2 days for a total of 15 minutes. On day 3 I picked up my new car. I got the price that I wanted and it only tied up 30 minutes of my time. Amazing. Dealer-Schmealer…Don't wast your time and energy on traditional dealers and call New Autos - Thanks guys, You have a lifetime client.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Our experience was surprisingly awesome.  We feel like we got a fabulous used car with lower mileage than we could have gotten had we gone elsewhere.  Usually, when you are buying a used car you are leery of surprises.  Ken Kirkman was courteous, listened to what we wanted to pay, gave us their lowest counteroffer in a straightforward manner (in writing), and we walked--drove!--away feeling like we had made a good deal.  After we completed the sale, they even contacted the original dealer to see if there were a second electronic key, which they gave to us two weeks later, saving us another couple hundred.  We also feel good about buying from a local company.  When we need another car we will definitely contact them first.</Review>< Pictures>

<text>This is the only way I will buy cars from now on. The experience was so much better than the typical car buying experience. I got the car I wanted at a price lower than the local dealer, lower than Consumer Reports, and lower than the Costco program. I completed most of the conversations over the phone or email and then walked into the office to pick up my car and 15 minutes later I was driving away without the stereotypical "upgrade" nonsense you get at the dealers.</text>< Pics>

It couldn't be easier.  In the process of purchasing a new 2013 Toyota Sienna XLE, Bernie walked us through the pros and cons of several different minivan models.  There was no haggling because the initial price quoted was well below all of the dealers we originally spoke with.  All of the same manufacturer discounts and financing applied.  We picked exactly the options, the exact color and our van was delivered the next day.  In a few years when I finally replace my truck I'll visit Bernie at New Autos Inc again!</review>

<text>Ken did a great job for us. Ordered an exact replacement of the car that had been totaled in an accident. The Chevy Spark ev he found for us had the more pricey trim package, brand new, and less expensive then our original car!
No more auto dealerships for me, I will be ordering my future cars from New Autos Inc.
Just wish that my wife would let me drive it.< /text><Gmap_id>0x808327b68b18bb9b:0xc365ea88280bb62d<//Gmap_id><rating>5</rating><Resp>None<//Resp><time>1444090188052</time><name>Peter Willingham<//name></record></dataset><record>

James is awesome.  I met with him and we talked about a couple different cars I had in mind.  He gave me his opinion on each of them but never once tried to push me towards one in particular.  When I made my decision I called him, gave him the make, model, options and color I wanted and what I wanted to pay.  In about 2 hours I had a call telling my he found what I was looking for.  It was exactly where I wanted and there was no haggling.  I WILL NEVER GO TO A DEALER AGAIN!!
Thanks James!!!< /Review>

<Text>Mr. Knaus
This is a short letter of appreciation for a pleasant buying experience - 5 stars! You and the team at New Autos, Inc. are committed to customer satisfaction. We truly appreciate your approach to this market segment.
We wanted to tell you, our whole experience from start to finish was professional and enjoyable. The car exceeded our expectations. We thoroughly enjoyed working with Ken and would recommend both him and New Autos, Inc. to anyone looking for an excellent automobile. In a world where we don't always have the best experience in a car dealership, this was great. It is without hesitation that we would buy another car from New Autos, Inc.
Best of all, we love our car! It is everything we thought it was and more. Looking forward to establishing a long term relationship.

I heard about NAI from our mechanic, and immediately went to check it out. Unfortunately my mom and I arrived right at closing time, however James took time to look at some cars with us and schedule an appointment for the following morning, at which I bought a 2011 Ford Focus. Perfect size, and we were really impressed with the FUN experience. Yes, car purchases can be fun with the right help! Thanks James & NAI staff!<//Text>

New Autos Inc made my entire buying experience easy, fun, and virtually stress-free. The entire staff was professional, courteous, and knowledgeable. Tony Kiernan provided exceptional customer service, from helping me assess my needs, to locating the perfect car for me, to organizing the financing process, all without ever being overbearing or pushy. The personalized service I received was second to none--I would happily buy my next car from NAI and recommend them to my family and friends.< /review>

If you want the best price, fastest service, and no-hassle experience when you purchase a new car, then look no further.  I've purchased two new autos from New Autos Inc. and have been extremely satisified.  Once you know the car you want, just call them up, give them all the info about the car including any options, and within a day or two they'll find it for you and at a price better than what you'd get haggling with a dealer for hours and no hidden fees after you've agreed on a price.  They have the car delivered to their lot, and after a short time filling out the necessary forms, you're driving off with your new car.  They also include all the manufacturer incentives and financing.  I've recommended NAI to friends and they've all said they'll never buy a car any other way.</Text>

<UserId.>113862576559745674484< /UserId.><Text>Hi my name is Julie Atlas and I sold two vehicles with New Autos Inc and purchased
three vehicles within the last 6 years. I believe if you are looking for a specific vehicle or even if you don't know what you are looking for, but you know you want another vehicle, New Autos Inc will help you find or locate the vehicle of your dreams.

Shopping for cars should be a fun and exciting experience. I know that from my experiences with this excellent Business. Just ask for Bernie and he will guide you through a fast and fun buying experience. I am so pleased with my 2011 Alian Metallic Green Kia Soul. My teenager thinks it is the coolest car I have ever had....she is right!

Thanks Again Bernie & Pam, I love my new car and my daughter and I will have many new and fun adventures driving all over California and beyond!

Cheers,

Tony with New Autos Inc made my car buying the experience the best!  He found the exact car that I wanted, a 2017 Mercedes-benz CLA 250 4matic, in 2 days with all the extras that I wanted.  He gave me full price on my trade-in and made the car buying process a breeze and hassle free.  I would definitely recommend New Autos Inc to anyone and will continue to purchase vehicles through them in the future.  Thank you New Autos Inc for my beautiful new car!< /text>

We have purchased two Nissan Altimas, a Nissan Sentra, and a Nissan Xterra from New Autos Inc. and have thoroughly enjoyed each experience. Tony is the best salesman ever! This is the only way to buy a car...no pressure, no hype, no hassle.  And they get you the lowest price possible along with any manufacturer incentives.  Delivery is very quick.< /review>

<review>I decided to purchase my first vehicle, a used 2010 Toyota Prius, with New Autos Inc. I worked with James Wogan, and I was very picky with finding the right car but he found multiple options for me, and even though I ended up paying a little more than my budget he got me great financing. I am happy with my purchase and the whole process was mostly painless.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

This is the second time we've purchased from New Autos Inc, Chico. We're quite happy with the service, the low pressure, and the ZERO hassle. We told James exactly what we wanted, he told us when he could get it for us (honestly, no stringing us along!) and roughly what the price would be.

When it came in (on time!) it was exactly what we'd asked for (no upsell pressure!) and at a fair price. Easy, quick, and stress-free!

If all car dealerships were like this people wouldn't hate car dealers. Just saying, if anyone's listening over at Wittmeier...< /Review>

We absolutely loved our entire buying experience with NAI. Jackie was referred to us and she didn't disappoint. She was very thorough in her research and was always very cordial whenever I would call or text her and if she didn't have an answer she would find out the information and get back to me promptly.  The car we wanted, a 2015 Nissan Murano, in blue with the features we wanted was very hard to find so she suggested we have her order it from the factory.  It was going to take about 3 months but we would be getting it at invoice.  We agreed since we weren't in a rush. 2 weeks after we ordered it she found our exact car at a dealership about 250 miles away. It was delivered to Chico within a few days.  She got us 0% financing and a $500 rebate from the dealer so we got it for about $2800 less than MSRP! We couldn't be happier! The paperwork was a breeze and we probably were at their facility no longer than 30 minutes. The big red bow on the hood was a nice touch as well. We will never buy a car from a dealership again. NAI deserves 5 stars!!</text>

Why go through the insane games played by auto dealers, when you can tell New Autos Inc. what kind of car you want, how much you want to pay -- and then get exactly what you want? No pressure, no drama. I walked in there on a Saturday, they ordered the car Monday, I drove it home early Tuesday afternoon after writing a check and signing the contract. What's not to like?!< /text>

It's not LA quality Korean food. But in a pinch Korean BBQ will satisfy my craving. Service is no nonsense and it's not a problem with me. I don't understand some of the low ratings. Perhaps I'm just easy to please. :)< /Text>

Quick, attentive service and delish food! All-you-can-eat BBQ is pretty standard. At least you know it's legit, since the tour buses roll through here pretty frequently.< /review>

<text>The food is not bad however it’a lacking flavor. The soup that is included the taste is so so. The varieties of meat is limited. The service is bad we have to keep calling them a couple of time to order the meat.
When they brought the bill for 3 of us $71.97 + $8.80 tax and $10.99 service fee. They are mot supposed to chg us 15% tips but that’s ok. But when the credit card slip came , the total charges with tax ONLY 78.99 , theres tip portion that empty and the total the wrote 90.99. So instead of paying tip $10.00 I endup have to pay $12.00. So I go to the cashier and ask them, the answer that’s ok you can change that. Wowww that’s a rip off.

PAY ATTENTION to your credit card  slip before you  sign it and pay intention to total tax. Its different between the charge paper and the credit card slip. They are kind of fishy.< /text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMtQvFxdt69hlu_OVyOa8GlcrnpkGe8Ru0_B4Tk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6ELNzzEvEzUgb3_S7vYCkm8VR2ZfTLnA0GliK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN5JrxIvuxJldVtouFwH_E9EV1qzNImGVusr8K0=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPoUuzFF2NuLFnQdOB5ELGGijEHE41QBd4GX_Jt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipObazuoOt5SLP8TVp4jrQ2NaSKFXnCfaVcaPvKN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYRXoToKeI5SR2SvvSClE1GWd7-oCdS8GSgdEX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNd4a2VvTfYSLkmraxgfIEStBAb6vquZjOqhLfQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><user>105403939525392995024< /user>< Rating>

<Text>Ignored by waitress most the of the time. Charged for plate we didn't order. Automatic gratuity on party of 3. Listed as "service charge." This might fool someone into tipping twice.

Food was mediocre. Not much complexity to marinade flavor. Banchan was lame. They didn't have the fish cake or seaweed wrappers.<//Text>< pictures>

<Review>Everything was good until they stopped my kids from having broccoli.  Apparently it isn't really all you can eat. They were super rude when I told them it was false advertising. I had to pay $25 each for my kids to have all you can eat when they left still hungry. I will never visit this place again.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808f79883aefecb5:0x90af3e40e4053b2a< /GmapID></record>

< Review>
AYCE Korean BBQ at fair price. Granted that the quality of the meats is ok and the selection is limited to only 6, like spencer steak, pork belly, spicy pork, chadol beef, marinated chicken and bulgogi. The banchans are vary and prepared surprisingly well. The dining room is what you expect from a no-frills family restaurant. The service is brisk and efficient, the busy servers don't have the time to chitchat. Above average compared to other Korean BBQ places in the SF vicinity. Also the final tab will also automatically include the 15% gratuity- I was going to tip more but hey, 15% is what they're going to get if they are going to include it in your bill.</Review>

Good reasonable prices, o asked for seafood soup and a Bulgogi the menu calls for rice on the side for the Bulgogi, I didn't get it. I didn't feel welcome here and when i finished the server came back and offered rice...too late. Is a good place for BBQ style Korean food if the servers get on their game.< /Review>

< Review>
Was the only place open at the time we needed. Wasn't expecting much from the reviews but our experience was very good. The server was very friendly and helpful. They have a large selection of banchans than we're not use to which is great since that's the reason we go to Korean bbq. Their selection of beef and pork is good although the chicken choices are very limited. But for the price it was worth it.</Review>

I'm not aware of many other places in the city that have 설렁탕 (beef soup).  This place is good.  They give you many side dishes 반찬 rather than just 3 or 4 in my restaurant. The side dishes are changed all the time.  So you will experience many varieties if you go a few more times.  The pancake is great as well.  Ask them to slightly over grill it to make it extra crispy and toasty.  The grill rib without bones is delicious as well but tend to be on the chewy side.  Other stew soups 찌개 are very good as well.</Review>

<text>This is not a Korean BBQ all you can eat that we expected. We experienced similar all you can eat meat buffet in Los Angeles and Seattle Washington where customer service and products were 100 percent satisfied. First thing first the meat they served was not good it’s hard meat to eat after grilling. It’s really terrible. I won’t recommend this restaurant for this price. They even run out of vegetables to goes with the meat.  Server were not friendly at all. After the first order he don’t want to replace the grill and we have to ask him to have a new grill so can grill a new set of meat. Hopefully all people who is looking for this kind of all you can eat meat. No way you will eat in this terrible place. No, no no. Star at all.< /text>< user>

Decent Korean place. We come in on a late Friday night which there are many empty tables but have no idea why it took more than 5 minutes for a waiter to show us a table to sit. Gonna try their All-you-can-eat BBQ next time.<//text>

<Review>We told them that we’re gonna eat all you can eat and they didn’t notice and they thought we were ordering the meat separately and when we got the bill check, it was over $400 for 6 people. Really bad service and bad quality meat.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The service was good this time around, the meat is OK quality but about par of what you would expect for all you can eat. Nothing particularly stand out but if you are craving Korean BBQ then this isn't a bad choice considering the area has slim pickings.< /Text>

While i rate the Decor poor, there really isn't anything to catch your eyes to start conversation. Since the whole point of Korean BBQ and to cook your own food is to have conversation, this seriously lacks the reason to talk about where you are at. The pricing and the food though will have you keep coming back!<//text>

Always a fun place to go. Very athentic Korean food and pretty busy during dinnee time. We usually come here for the Korean BBQ where they have a big tables with the grill and space to spread out all the food. Fast and friendly service but maybe sometimes hard to understand the servers.</Text>

<Review>Mixed bag based on prior visits

The food served are basic Korean ones. When my mom and I visited, the seafood toufu was not fresh. Howerer, my hot stone rice were all good in every visits since then. Even my Chinese friends like there. Their pancake is awesome. I will give another try.<//Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808f79883aefecb5:0x90af3e40e4053b2a</Gmap_id></record>

theres just two things that would make this place amazing for me. let start with the good first , the 20 dollar PP unlimited meat thing is awesome. Korean BBQ in general is awesome. the beer selection is Awesome. BUT thats about it in terms of good things for this place. the staff is not attentive at all even though when we came in only like 4  tables where occupied. the inattentiveness led to us waiting an absurd amount of time and me having to get up and go around to the counter to request things. then when i left a bad tip for the bad service the girl even gave me a snotty attitude!< /Text>

A little pricey for Korean BBQ, but overall very delicious. Their marinade game is top notch, so I recommend the bulgogi.</Review>

Met and old friend from middle school hear to chat.  The food was ok and the service was as well.  This would not be my first choice.  The ribs were ok the bi bim bap was watery.  The Jap chae was the best item we ordered.  They have a good sized parking lot and the tables were clean.<//review>

<Review>Bulgogi was pretty tasteless, chicken was decent, overall pretty disappointed....considering the prices weren't on the low side for quality of taste , probably worst bulgogi I've ever eaten easily the most tasteless,  Costco bulgogi blows it away...yes I said it....I've been eating bulgogi for over 35 yrs</Review>< Pictures>

Pricey.. but man.. what a meal (the BBQ at your table feast).  The meats were pre-seasoned.. but you cook them at the table with various add on seasonsings like soy bean paste (yum! never had that before), raw garlic, kimchees, etc.  What an incredible set of flavors. I've had a bit of korean BBQ.. even made my own at home. but I was so glad t otry these guys out and see how it's really done. Was a bit expensive.. and I would have appreciated a bit of coaching on what flavors go with what. espcecially for folks who have never had Korean and get a table full of raw + picked ingredients, and a pair of sissors.. hehe.. they muc hreally be confused. But I was a happy camper there tonight. Just dom't "over kimchee" as I often do, or your spouse/friends may complain for the next couple of days.. ;)< /Text>

Service was terrible. Even though there were many empty seats, owner said we have to wait until occupied customers leave. I asked why and he said it's hard to clean both tables. It doesn't make any sense. We don't have spend money for this restaurant.< /Review>

So happy I found another great Korean place near my new place. Korean BBQ House is a full-on Korean restaurant complete with grill at your table BBQs, all you can eat BBQ specials, and a variety of non-bbq dishes.

They seem super authentic, because there are a bunch of dishes that I've never seen before. Everybody knows that's the marker of an authentic ethnic restaurant, right?

The $20 AYCE BBQ special lets you choose between two options (see one of the photos). Sounds pretty cool.

They give you a variety of banchan - 8 when I ate there, but from other Yelpers pictures, more if you do bbq. Both the tofu soup and kimchi pancake were spot on. The tofu soup came piping hot - almost scalding my tongue, lots of beef, rich broth, and big portion of tofu.

Service was quick and courteous. Definitely worth a go!<//Review>

<Review>JD (owner) just did the most amazing (and quick!) windshield repair in my Audi R8. It was seriously unbelievable.... In a really good way!!

Imagine my horror this morning when I hear the most agonizing sound of a rock hitting the middle of my windshield. Ugh.

I’ll be honest, before on previous cars, I did the whole “clear nail polish trick” to get me by but it would always end up looking worse.

I could not go the “ghetto route” on a car like this. I found 911 on Yelp with their perfect 5-Star rating.

JD was super-cool. He said it would look a lot better but not perfect... However, it looks 99.99% better. You can’t even see it anymore!! My biggest regret was not taking a “before” picture.

Thank you so much!!!!!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMdnkHVSIy6qB_Rjn-Xd838kbsLqlUWc74jw98J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1528828444120, 'text': 'Thx!

I had a trip coming up to AZ and I was worried the spot would get bigger with our long drive in the hot weather. So I waited to write this review until a couple  of weeks later. I am so pleased with outcome !He was willing to fix my chipped windshield with a short notice after his normal hours on a Sunday Morning. Supper happy with service! He saved me lot of money. I highly recommend him.<//Review><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1600314866542, 'text': 'Thank you Sean !'}<//resp>< gmap_id>

When it comes to windshield repair and replacement, look no further! JD was very responsive (same-day service), knowledgeable, honest, and thorough in his evaluation and repair of my cracked windshield. He provided mobile service, which was extremely convenient as well. JD takes pride in his work and wants to earn your business by making sure that his customers are happy and satisfied with his services. Would recommend to anyone looking to get their windshield repaired or replaced. Thanks again!<//text>

JD came out to fix my windshield which was a small dime sized ding. Turned out that it had already been repaired...just not that well, and unfortunately nothing could be done to improve it. I felt bad since he made the trip for nothing and began to see if there were any other repairs on other cars. He told me that the additional small nicks I had wouldn't be worth fixing. I appreciated the honesty. I will definitely use his services in the future.< /Review>

Look no further! Friendly, knowledgeable and professional. I had a very large crack in my windshield, I called this guy and he came over within the hour. The price was very reasonable and he was so fast and efficient. I’ve had things in my windshield fixed before and I never knew the difference. You can’t even see where he repaired my window it’s unbelievable. I won’t use anyone else in the future. And he smells good too! Lol<//text>

<Text>Do not bother getting your windshield replaced with this business. The owner JD specified that the windshield had life time warranty including cracks, leaks, etc. 3 months later my windshield cracked and they are not upholding their life time warranty. I’m a huge supporter of small businesses but you’re better off going to SafeLite.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<review>We just came here after our windshield got cracked on the freeway. Found this place through a quick google search and decided to stop by and it was a great experience and Anthony (the tech) helped us getting it through tour insurance for a no charge fix. Great business and great person Anthony was. Highly recommended!</review>< Pics>

Super helpful, fast and easy. JD initially helped with contacting my insurance company to start the claim with no deductible.

Once approved, I came back and had Anthony perform the work. Super nice guy! Very efficient and professional. In and out in 15 minutes.

Highly recommend and will use their services again if I have another incident with my glass.</Review>

I had a small rock chip on my windshield that needed repair, and they were able to help fix it up quickly.  This was my first experience fixing a chip in my windshield so I'm unsure how well it'll will hold up over time; however, Anthony was super helpful and worst case scenario, I could come back and they can re-assess again in the future.  Knowledgeable and fairly priced as well - thank you!</review>

Great!  JD responded within minutes of contact. Asked for photos and sizes of cracks (chips). Gave a quote for what was provided on the photos. Explained the other much smaller ones were of no real consequence.   He guaranteed his work like the "other" mega paid shop.  Support this company! Professional. Learned about Arizona insurance too. This is who you must keep in your phone!  Wow and thank you!!!  Lifesaver!  Thanks JD!< /review>

A pebble hit my windshield on the freeway and resulted in 3 cracks. JD came out to my house within hours of my call and did such a great job with the repair that you can barely see the cracks at all. Highly recommend JD!<//Review>

<review>If you need a windshield repaired or replaced - go here! You will be sorry if you do not go to 911! I needed two spider cracks fixed - a rock hit my windshield yesterday. I looked at and researched different shops - I am SO happy that I chose 911! This shop is the real deal. The reviews do not lie. JD was able to get me in this morning at 11. My technician Anthony went right to work and I was out before 11:30. The price is the best in town! The work is the best in town! I would send my daughters, sons, my wife and any of my friends and know that they will get a professional job without worry! Don't be a shmuck and go somewhere else - you will regret it. Hopefully I will never have to use 911 again - but if I do there will be no hesitation. Did I mention they have a Lifetime Warranty!! JD and Anthony you guys are the BEST!< /review><Pics>None</Pics><response>{'time': 1556075407587, 'text': 'Thank you!'}< /response><gmap_id>0x80dc72e3f758b619:0x129c67c69f5b10b3< /gmap_id></record>

Had a great experience with this company. Anthony approached me while I was at the car wash and was very informative and professional. He offered to get me a quote for getting my windshield replaced due to a huge crack in it. It was a very reasonable  price and they even came to my home to replace it. They did a great job!!!</review>

<Review>I took my car to the Palomar Hand-wash in Carlsbad  this afternoon and Anthony from 911 Windshield greeted me upon arrival. He quickly noticed that I had a small chip in my windshield; I was already aware of it but hadn’t yet gotten around to having it fixed.  Fortunately, Anthony was able to have this taken care of literally in less than five minutes before my car was even finished with the detail.  I found the service to be  very efficient and extremely helpful. Thanks again Anthony!<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><rating>5< /rating></record></dataset><record>

<review>I had a small ding in my Windshield that was starting to spread. I brought my car to 911 Windshield repair and they took care of it immediately. They also called my insurance and got it covered completely with no deductible and no negative effects on my rates. I highly recommend them to anyone!! Luke was very friendly and educated us on the process as well as the insurance process.< /review>< pics>

I called around to see what it would cost to get a small crack repaired on my windshield, it was a linear crack, not a "spider web" type crack. One business actually told me that they could not repair that type of crack, even after I sent them a picture, and asked if I wanted a quote to replace the windshield. Anthony at 911 Windshield Repair in Carlsbad did a great job repairing the crack, at a great price, in a very timely manner. I would highly recommend this company!< /Text>

When I arrived, Anthony was already there waiting and got to work right away. He was very nice and did his work efficiently and carefully. The whole process took less than 20 minutes. He made sure that everything was perfect before sending me off. I am definitely recommending 911  Windshield Repair to everyone.<//Review>< user_name>

Now, I don't have to go to a auto shop.  Anthony, was very helpful! All I have to do is call my insurance company to get reimbursed! Super simple! Definitely using them again.
P.S. their services are lifetime warranty!< /Review></record>

I’ve had two separate repairs done with them now, and both times I was in and out in less than thirty minutes. They are very knowledgeable about the different coverage plans for the various auto insurance carriers and make it easy to file a claim for reimbursement. Ten out of ten would recommend for any windshield repair needs!<//Review>< Pictures>

Finally found someone who knows what their doing. JD was awesome helping me repair my front windshield. I didn't even have to come out of pocket because my insurance company covered the cost for repair. My deductible got waived. JD had exceptional workmanship and professional customer service.

I came for a car wash and was informed I had two cracks in my windshield that could be quickly fixed and would be fully covered by my insurance. Within five minutes we called my insurance company and it was fully approved free of charge and my windshield was fixed within twenty minutes. Great service - would definitely come back again and recommend to anyone.<//text>

< Review>
Anthony’s Awesome!

Long Version: a few months ago I was shopping & when I returned to my car I noticed a small crack in windshield! I had no idea how it got there

Overnight that crack traveled and was t 12 inches long. Unfortunately I had to pay to out of pocket to replace the whole thing!

A couple of weeks ago driving down the freeway I heard a loud noise! Ohmygoodness I just could NOT believe it was happening again!!!

Within 15 minutes I was back home & saw an infestation less than the size of a penny & not having money to replace windshield again I applied clear nail polish heavily several coats.

Fast forward 2 weeks. I pop in to Palomar’s car wash in Carlsbad & a young man named Anthony approached me. He pointed out that I could probably have a 1 year guarantee FREE windshield repair if my insurance company covered it. He called them for me within 5 minutes my insurance carries said it was a freebie!

Happy Dance!
Thank You Anthony! Total professional , helpful & kind</Review>

SOLID 5 Stars! JD is the definition of exceptional customer service! He is honest and thorough with his work and the explanation of his recommendation. He definitely has the customers best interest in mind. I purchased a 2017 GMC Canyon 3 days ago and got a 6inch windshield crack, he was able to repair and provide peace of mind and guaranteed his work. I am very satisfied with his work and would definitely recommend him him to anyone. Definitely knows what he is doing!</Text>

There was a closer shop but I drove the extra mile to have him do the repair. He was very professional and proficient. I was extremely impressed with the results. Unfortunately 3 days after my repair... I was unlucky enough to be hit again with a rock, and another crack in the windshield :(  I immediately called JD, he was not at the shop, so he offered to come to me! Super happy with the work and extremely happy with his client care. I'd give him 10 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟<//review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>I cannot rave enough about this shop. JD got me in within MINUTES of me calling him in a panic. Fixed a chip in my windshield, guaranteed his work for as long as I own the car, and was professional and courteous. I am so relieved to have found his shop. If you find yourself in a chip OR replacement situation, call him first. You’re a lifesaver, JD!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

When a rock flew up and cracked my windshield, I immediately hopped online to search for windshield repair companies in the area. I saw the great reviews for 911 Windshield Repair and decided to give them a call. Initially, I was calling to get an estimate on the cost and a timeframe for when I could bring my van in for the repair. JD and Sean were absolutely wonderful to work with! Within an hour of calling them, my windshield was repaired!! JD worked his magic and was able to repair the damage on the spot, while Sean took care of filing the repair work with our insurance company, so we wouldn't have any out of pocket costs. These guys are AWESOME!! Very friendly and professional, we will definitely be calling them the next time we need our windshield repaired! I highly recommend these guys!!< /text>

<Review>Super-star customer service, over a dozen years of experience, a fair price for repair, and a written guarantee for the work. Perfect.

I got a NASTY crack in my windshield today. I gave JD a call, and he was available to fix my windshield immediately. Other services would have made me wait until my next day off, which is 5 days from now, to schedule an estimate during business hours. With a crack as bad as this, I did NOT want to wait in case it started to spread, and I was extremely pleased to hear that JD was available after 6:00 PM to address the repair ASAP.

In terms of customer service, I couldn't have asked for better. He greeted me with a handshake, explained the process and estimated time for repairs and got right to work. He explained the repair process as he was doing it, explained why he was doing each particular thing, and I watched the crack completely disappear in front of my eyes.

In terms of pricing, I let him know that I was paying cash, without insurance (my 2005 Ford doesn't have - or need - full coverage) and his price was less than HALF of safelite.

In terms of quality, the spider-crack is all gone. When the repairs were finished, JD handed me a written guarantee of his work. He told me he's been doing this for the past 15 years, and his experience was evident in the speed of repair and confidence in his own work.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>{'time': 1496467443682, 'text': 'Thank you for your kind words and being an awesome customer!

Anthony is great. Knowledgeable about small rocks causing potential damage to our windshield. Due to an accident on Interstate 15 south on Saturday, we were rerouted to a dirt road (highway 161) for 3 hrs. Our car was pretty dusty and lots of rocks were hitting the windshield as we drove on this dirt road. Anthony look care of these small cracks, all approved in advance through our insurance, in a matter of minutes. Highly recommend 911 Windshield Repair and Replacement

<Review>FAST, HIGH QUALITY SERVICE!

2nd time getting a windshield rock chip repair at this place. Repairmen reply promptly to inquiries and complete quality work in 10-15 minutes for my rock chips.  He even repaired a 2nd chip I hadn’t noticed (8/29/19).

I come here right away before the crack spreads and becomes too large to repair.

<review>I called around and spoke to another windshield repair place and sent pictures. I was told I would have to replace my windshield. Luckily I kept calling and found 911. Anthony not only fixed my windshield he provided excellent service and a very reasonible price with a warranty.

Got my windshield repaired in less than 15 minutes! The guy was very efficient and the fix cost me nothing out of pocket with my insurance. I was not aware my insurance covered windshield and chip repair! Will return for sure :)< /review>

I just got back from having my windshield repaired by JD and 911 Windshield Repair & Replacement in Carlsbad. Late last year, JD replaced the terribly cracked-up windshield on my Toyota Tundra quickly and at a reasonable price. Three short months later and be damned if the new windshield didn't sustain a brand new quarter-sized crack (more like a "crush") from a bolt that bounced out off a big junk-hauling dumpster truck on I-5 and crashed into the dead center of my windshield. I called JD and he said to bring it by any time today, so I did. In under 20 minutes, he had sealed the crack with a sort of resin and my windshield is good again. I am very fortunate to have found someone like JD who treats his customers well. I strongly recommend you use JD and 911 Windshield Repair & Replacement. They are reliable and solid!<//text>

On the way to work, a small gravel hit and chipped my 2017 MX5 RF windshield. I went to the Carlsbad location, and Anthony took care of it.
911 Windshleld Repair was prompt in answering my call, repairing/filling my crack, and handling the necessary paperwork with my insurance company. Excellent service... Thanks again!</Text>

Very quick response. Repair completed in 2 cracks in 15 minutes! Luke was great and contact through my insurance provider resulted in $0 out of pocket.<//text>

2 small chips (1 with a line crack) reduced to 2 translucent dots and no risk of spreading.  I was in and out in 10 minutes which was way less time than Geico's glass claim processing.  JD even offered great pointers in that regard.  I'm recommending 911 WR&R to all who need glass repair/replacement.<//review>

Called to get a quote and the guy was so short. Honestly they had a higher price than Safelite Autoglass.

If a manager is reviewing this, learn better customer service skills.</review>

This guy saved me lots of money! My insurance told my my windshield was not covered enless I paid my deductible. Jaime told me, that was not true and If the crack is smaller than a dollor that they waive the deductible. He gave me the # to call for my insurance and totally hooked me up! Got my car done same day and in under 15 min. Jaime even went one step further and hooked me up with a carwash. I highly recommend this guy! He is very professional and a cutie! Thanks Jaime!</Review>

They told me that I had to contact my insurance company for reimbursement. It would have only been a five minute phone call for them.<//review>

{'time': 1535611833108, 'text': 'Hello Debra this is the owner Jd. I just went through 30 days of invoices and did not find your name Debra Balmos on any of my invoices.\nI’m all about doing the 5 minute phone call to get my customers approved and no cost. In fact 90 percent of my customers I get done for free with that 5 minute phone call and I make sure to ask every customer who their Insurance is and offer to do for free though the insurance.\nThe other 10 percent have liability only or only want to pay cash.\nAre you sure you have the right company?\nPlease contact me and I would be happy to reimburse you whatever you paid but like I said I can’t find you in our invoices.\n714-949-9544\nPlease reach out I want to resolve this.\nThank you.'}</Resp>

<text>I plan on doing a lot of business with the hardware store. Today I'd like you thank them for their generosity. They sponsored a free breakfast for veterans at all three Crazy Otto's . I served in Vietnam and in the decades since I have not seen such a generous gift to vets. I'll be telling friends and family to check out the hardware store as we don't have a need for feed/grain. Thank you and God bless you.<//text>< Pics>

The people who work there are very friendly and helpful.  Van Dam Farms is an excellent hardware store. Overall a much better experience than the chaos and confusion of places like Home Depot.< /review>

<Review>The Asian meatballs were very disappointing. I think they are a limited-time item and I couldn't be happier. The meatballs were small, hard, and overcooked. I wasn't a fan of the sauce either. This location is next to a Starbucks so trying to get parking and get out of your parking space is an issue due to the Starbucks drive-thru. The restaurant was clean and their staff was friendly. The beef bowl was wonderful.<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO8oUQi8izDcf8QqEo-FdekxJXqfjj28caYUvzc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPCnmT5CMOQLDepNgqPJKyWxi8FalQ4A__Xx5t9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOydpVK5ygJPIsG5f4hl1X2OSkMMHMRkUSC78sh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c29c9ad122fe0f:0x7dd9a01b1edc52ae< /Gmap_id></record>

MM its really yummy gyuudon but NO BENISHOGA!!!
if you are really smart you can buy the yoshinoya frozen packs at a japanese specialty store and make it at home! it tastes much better AND IS MUCH CHEAPER than going to these actual chain outlets. yoshinoya in japan actually is really struggling recently simply because it has TOO many chain locations in japan, i wonder what will happen in california!!! either way i will come agaiN!!!< /review>

It was a good place to eat prior to the remodel! Decent amount of food for the price. However, anyone noticed the quantity is being cut down to at least 1/3 compare to previous owner !</Review>

Service is hit or miss, depending on what time you go. I was here on Saturday afternoon, around 130pm, only 3 customers in front of me, took more than 15mins before I got my regular bowl, even that I had to go to the counter to ask for my food as the people after me already gotten theirs. Not sure why they are so slow, it's not like they cook to order<//text>

I can't even imagine this!!! Is it a joke?? really?? who does run this place?????? it's not like piece of hair, it can KILL you!!!!! at the begining I thought it's just some vegetable then I found out it's too thick and hard. Story wasn't finished there and funny is that when I went to counter and I ask can you describe why it is in my food, the cashier looked at me and said mmm idk! do you want another one? it looked like it's a normal matter in their kitchen.

(Translated by Google) A terrible place where they do not know how to take a take out order and do it correctly
The orders are never prepared well, something is always missing or they give you something that you did not fill and in the end the managers are rude since they do not know how to take a claim, they only want one to leave so as not to stain the name of the company and in the end how always "the customer is to blame" and why because as they told me "that's why check your order"

(Original)
Un pesimo lugar donde no saben tomar una orden para llevar y hacerlo correctamente
Las ordenes nunca las preparan bien siempre falta algo o te dan algo que tu no padiste y al final las los encargados  son groseros  ya que no saben  tomar un reclamo  solo quieren que uno se salga  para no manchar el nombre de la empresa  y al final como siempre " el cliente tiene la culpa " y por que  por que como me dijeron "por eso cheque su orden"< /Review>

This Dominos has the nicest people working there. The ingredients are very fresh and their marinara sauce is terrific! Delivery is prompt and pizzas are hot and sodas icy cold. A super pizza team! Highly recommended!</review>

<date>1601869243034</date><rating>1<//rating><Review>Placed order at 5:27 on a Sunday night. As of right now it is 8:38 and still no pizza or contact from the store. I’ve tried calling multiple times and haven't been able to get in contact with someone. On hold for over 20 minutes. I will never be bringing my business to this store again. I can understand a busy night but at least have the decency to contact your customers if there’s an issue. I highly recommend going elsewhere if you want your food.<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Some nights I am in the mood for real pizza, and some nights I am in the mood for Domino's. I've lived in the area for many years and this Domino's is reliable. It is not authentic Italian cuisine. It is Domino's. The toppings are not fresh. The pizza can be pretty greasy at times. But I love it. Tip your delivery person! I have had nothing but excellent experiences from this location. The delivery is quick and friendly and the pizza is hot and tasty! And the cinnamon twists are so delicious. I will order pizza as an excuse to get the cinnamon twists with it. I've also got pick up many times, which is cheaper and a good way to ensure that your pizza is as fresh as possible. I always order with the app which is very convenient. The tracker on the app can be inaccurate and I ignore it. You will probably get your pizza within 45 minutes at most. I highly recommend.<//Text>< pics>

Update: spoke with the manager and he gave us a credit for our order for next time.</Review>< name>

Tried to place an order online and after going through everything at the very end when click place order, it kept saying "theres a problem. Please call the store." No matter what. Then called store and waited on hold for 20 mins with no answer ever. Finally gave up and went somewhere else to eat. Got on here to leave 1 star. What is wrong with Dominoes!</Review>

<Review>It's been a long time since I bought a pizza at domino's. But my friends said thin crust was good. For the price, it wasn't very good. Should of been no more than $8.00. If there was a promo, the clerk should said something.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmap_id>0x80ec5ebe907f9349:0x565b7feea03f1ca6<//gmap_id></record>

Carlos the “manager” shouldn’t be allowed to manage anything. He’s rude and after he lost my order told me that my new order will show up cold. Then he hung up on me. Carlos the “manager” should be allowed to talk to customers or be employed by anybody.</Review>

<text>Gets really frustrating when you order and pay for double/extra anything and your order comes EXACTLY as if you hadn't! Tastes good but come on, guys! Load the pizza, stop skimping, and make it obvious there's EXTRA as ordered!< /text>< Gmap_id>

Note to self. Do not order from this location on Friday nights. Ordered carry out. Screen says I'm next and my order is ready. First employee goes to get my pizza and starts working on boxes. Second employee goes to get my order and starts working on boxes. Third employee turns off the screen and says that screen is wrong. All carry out pizza is 30 minutes out. Girl comes in asking for 'her ' pasta. Knows names of employees. She gets her order immediately and says loudly 'you guys are doing a great job. Don't pay any attention to the customers'. Manager tells a customer that his order is lost and he can cancel his order for a refund or order and wait. A few other very angry customers and I received our pizza after an hour wait. Get home and the pizza and sandwich are cold. I suggest the management at this Dominos work on their customer value because we need attention.<//text>

<Text>Ordered inside -med pizza was suppose to be 15 minutes.  Thirty minutes went by I finally had to ask. It was in the back!!  They did not apologize. Just gave me the pizza.  Got home to eat it. The pizza was cold so it was just sitting there for awhile. Not pleased with the slow service.<//Text><Date>1563566805315</Date></record>

Worst sandwiches ever! 8 bucks and a 20 minute wait! Then the disappointment of oily veggies and cheese and the meats. I couldn't have been more disgusted. I love your thincrust pizzas but please leave the sandwiches to someone else or buy a clue and try a new approach!< /review>

I typically just order take out, and the pizza is pretty good. Management really needs to tell their drivers to slow down in residential. I live right around the corner and they always drive like it's 30 minutes or your pizza is free.<//text>

Never returning. Total disaster. My wife ordered a special pizza, as she's a vegan.
With no cheese and every vegetable offered on the menu. We got the pizza and the crust was warm and the vegetables were cold and piled on. Someone even managed to make a slice in the crust and stuff vegetables in there. A total mess. If you don't want to make the pizza, just say it's not available.<//text>

Don't get me wrong,  I enjoy ordering from you guys because the pizza is good and the service is good.   But EVERYTIME I order a garden salad with Ceaser dressing, y'all bring me a Ceaser salad.. wouldn't be so bad except the chicken on those salads is NASTY.

And so far there has never been any like "fix" for that mistake. And I even make sure in the delivery notes to say that it's a garden salad.....</text>

<Text>I used to get pizza from here every now and then. However, I feel the quality has majorly gone downhill. I ordered the gluten-free pizza, and thatwas like trying to chew through leather. The last time I ordered something I was at my mom's house. The got the order wrong twice.... And still the pizza was mediocre at the very best.<//Text>< pictures>

<user_name>Michael Dolan</user_name><date>1530942077105<//date><rating>1< /rating><Text>I  made an online order at this establishment and receive an email message saying that my order was ready to come pick up. I walk into the store 10 minutes after receiving the message to encounter a rude employee telling me that it wasn’t ready and I explain the situation to him stating that I had received an email that it was, and as I was saying that he continuously was walking away from me   Just repeating and saying it’s not ready that means it’s not ready and was treating me absolutely rudely! Then another employee walked up to me asking if I’ve been helped and I said you could call it that. So once the young gentleman went to go help me, come to find out my order was ready the whole time and the first guy was just too lazy to actually check. So I waited 10 minutes  To get helped out after my food was already ready for 10 minutes prior to that so I asked to speak with the manager. The first individual walked up in the middle of me talking to the manager and started arguing with me about how that’s not what he said and he was polite to me blah blah blah and was pretty much screaming at me saying I was wrong and lying. I asked him to please walk away I did not want to speak with him and I wanted to continue to speak with the manager and he would not and kept arguing then accuse me of being the one in the wrong. Waltz all this is going on the manager did no disciplinary action nor did he have his employee walk away when I asked for him to not be present. I stated, would you like to receive a bad review and possibly lose your job and the original guy that treated me so bad sad I don’t care about this job you can do whatever you want and I don’t give a  F***. Absolutely the worst experience with Domino’s ever and I will never be coming back to this store and I recommend highly that nobody ever goes to this Domino’s again, and I expect to be responded to by corporate in response to this review. Very disappointed!  I’ve been a customer of dominoes and the dominoes points reward system for a very long time now and have never been treated so bad! Something needs to be done about the store because that was the worst customer service I’ve ever received in my life!

They have an ongoing special of a lg 5 topping for $10.99.  We altered the cali chicken bacon ranch to 5 toppings, Tamara made it, n it was amazing!  I don't think it would have been possible to make it any better!  It was ready so quickly as well.  Thank you so much Tamara, n the rest of the Dominos employees, it was delicious!< /Review>

Ordered online, their pizza tracker said it had arrived, not so, I called the store said it was on its way, 40 minuets later a room temperature card board box with the saddest looking round thing arrived was a supposed large  costing $24.

Called in to get an order delivered to the beach or see about doing so and got hung up on due to misunderstanding of my accent while trying to clear it up as best as possible for the employee of the establishment. Called back second female answered and put me on hold to speak with manager when I didn't ask for it, manager states I can't come pick it up and they wont deliver to me unless I have an address. I'm a tourist of the city visiting the beach for the night.<//text>

Usually good but tonight they got my pizza order wrong. I ordered a pizza with Canadian bacon pineapple and actual bacon and instead they put jalapeños on instead of the bacon!< /Text>

< Review>
After walking in we had to wait a couple minutes due to a phone call. However it sounded to be a personal call and “he was ordering ramen and telling someone his throat really hurt and he wasn’t feeling good” as he continued to sniffle. Then we noticed no one wears gloves here preparing the food. By the way sick guy on the phone went back to the line to make pizzas. After we paid we sat down and noticed another guy wiping his nose with his wrist and continued to box the pizzas up. After waiting for 10mins they realized they hadn’t completed our order which was already supposed to be ready for “pickup when we got there”. While waiting for the rest of our order. Another guy on the line got frustrated with amount of orders, so he started shouting “why don’t you guys go eat tacos and do something better with you lives than order dominos” (it’s cinco de Mayo) and not directed towards anyone in the store. He just kinda blurted it out. After finally receiving our order we got home and noticed they had screwed it up and the pizzas were cold. Overall it was very chaotic and a bad experience for our first time.   Anyways fingers crossed we don’t get sick!< /Review>

<user>116820787861796631989< /user><Text>So about 2 weeks ago I got a Large Meat Combo given to me by a friend, it was awesome. Tonight I thought about getting another. I called and a girl answered, I'm not gonna put her on blast but her name was opposite of Winter. So i told "Winter" that i needed to order a pizza. Winter asked me if my name was Jeff and when I said no she tried to convince me otherwise, like I don't know what my name is. Then she rattled off some phone number and asked me if it was mine, when I said no she tried to convince me otherwise. I kept repeating through a of this that all I needed was to order a pizza. Then Winter told me she couldn't hear me. Ok, I called back on the landline. I told Winter once again I needed to order a pizza, she asked if my name was Greg. At this point I said sure my name is Greg can I order a pizza now? Winter came back with, well this is either Greg or it isn't. I informed little Ms. Winter that after 10 minutes of trying to order a pizza from her that I was going to order from some where else. Called up my normal pizza place, got 2 for 1 and had the pizza in my hands in 15 minutes. I probably will not go back, that's how disappointing the experience was.😠< /Text>< pictures>

Its been pretty good (not great but good) for a long time and we order at least once per week. Apparently any delivery over $35 requires a card now. Thats not an issue except I prefer to use cash. Guess its time to switch Pizza places. Oh well.<//review>

<text>Michael is a horrible manager and should find a new job not in customer service. I order once a week online and the delivery drivers are awesome. Well i had the pleasure of calling in for once since it was just desserts and the employee who answered put me on hold for 15 minutes. I hung up called back he immediately tried to put me on hold again. I asked to speak to a manager he said he was the manager so I told him I've been on hold for 15 minutes and whats was going on. He very very rudly told me basically thats what i get for hanging up and calling back and that i would be put back on hold again and he was very happy to let me know it would be at the bottom of the queue and it would be a while haha. I asked his name he said Michael with great pride at being rude as all hell to a customer who is very loyal to this location. I will order from a local small chain competitor now like fattys or Palo mesa. You are a horrible example of a manager michael. By the way ordered my cinnamon sticks from a local competitor way better anyways!!< /text>< pictures>

Great value for the money.   Online order at 2:03pm delivered at 2:35pm.  George made it, Charlie delivered it.  Great job for both!  Bbq chicken needed more sauce though. Mango habanero was great, starts sweet then comes the heat!  Pizza awesome cooked perfectly and ample toppings.   Would definitely recommend.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

I'm a regular customer, and it is rare for them to take a long time or deliver a pizza less than piping hot.  There are always coupons available and the delivery people are always friendly and courteous.</Review>

Awful!  The girl who answered the phone at Domino's on Elm and Grand was so rude, I couldn't even get to the point of ordering.  She hung up on me after I asked her if she was seriously acting that way.  I called back, and Lee had the nerve to tell me she hung up after I cussed, which I never did.  How could I when I only got 10 words out?  CALL FATTES PIZZA INSTEAD!   Great service and delicious 2 for 1 pizzas  = )< /review>

<Review>Ordered a thin crust sausage pizza OMG it was thinner than a cracker and as dry.  No flavor what so ever and the sausage you'd have to find with a magnifying glass..cheese?  ..what cheese.  Buyer Beware!!  Now I am $8.50 poorer.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<Text>No deliveries for the disabled.Makes disabled customers drive down to the store just to place order.

< Review>
So I ordered the pasta with spinach, chicken, tomatoes, & alfredo sauce . My order is delivered & the pasta had NO TOMATOES , I call & they were nice & sent another one to me. However this new pasta didn't have the CHICKEN ! I work for a hotel in Pismo Beach & I will not be recommending guest to this Domino s. Little problems but still dissatisfying< /Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I live in Las Vegas, NV  but I come to Pismo quite frequently for work... without hesitating the first thing I do when I get into town is call this Domino's location after a ridiculously long day of driving.  The wings, pizza, delivery time and driver,  are ALWAYS on point! Perfect way to start my 'paid vacations' when I'm starving and lazy 😎</review>< pictures>

I am a bit disappointed before I even get my pizza I was sitting in the waiting room while my pizza sat for 10 minutes because they didn't bother to tell us it was ready I will no longer go to the Domino's on the corner of grand and Elm because they really made me mad<//Text>

< Review>
OK today I went in and ordered a delivery order for tomorrow A-day early but I also used my free pie of the slice pizza and I got it and I was disappointed it was a pepperoni and sausage pizza but the problem was the outside of the pizza was burnt and the sausage all entire pizza or also burnt and I wish I can post a photo but Yelp is not working right now but it is the worst pizza ever unfortunately I was not going to go in and have the remake it but for right now I'm sorry to give you guys a one star because that is outrageous nest he pizza it isn't then and it was burnt</Review>

The employee taking my order was very  rude and was brushing me off  like I was a bogus order. If they  are not allowed to deliver to a hotel room  then say so!!! Don't make it sound like your pizza will arrive and have a customer waiting for something that was never intended to be delivered!!! Shame on you!!< /review>

Terrible delivery service! Do not order from this place unless you have to, it's not the first time either. You know it's bad when you need to put you pizza In the microwave because it's so cold will never spend money here again..< /text>

The location  is small but very welcoming.  The cashier is a very polite and nice young man.  I have a feeling this is going to be my new fave place<//Text>

<text>This used to be one of my favorite restaurant but it’s has gone down hill the past couple of years. The food is overpriced for portions and quality. The staff are RUDE. They have messed up my last 3 orders and now I will not be returning. Real bummer. It used to be so great.<//text>< Response>

Food was really good, but they need to fix their website online orders. When arrived to pick up my order they didn't know about it until looking it up. When they did get my order they forgot an entire meal..they were out of a lot of things.... spent over an hour here trying to get my order..overall bad experience but good food that slightly made up for it.<//text>

<Text>This place has awesome good food but the service OH MY GOD!!! They service is so bad. You gonna need to spend 1 hour or more to wait for your order. You waited so long for your order only to find out that they messed up your order. They messed up my food so many times so i decided to write a review.. They need new workers and keep up with orders.<//Text><pics>None< /pics></record>

Very very slow service and terrible customer service! She acted like she didn't want to be there. She told 15 minutes but it was more like 45 minutes. She never said she was sorry I had to wait. Never going there again!!!!!!!</Text>

Delicious food. Friendly workers. The variety of food they have is amazing and the art work people make on the chalk board makes this place a place for everyone. I love surf and turf and their snow bubble cookies flavor. Though I do have to admit, the noodles on surf and turf is super greasy.<//review>

Amazing food. Always made to order, only suggestion I have, is the staff can be more professional and the security guard randomly hangs out in the kitchen while waiting for his food, that's unsanitary. But the food is always good, the Adobo could sit longer and merry with the juices because some pieces are hard and tough to chew. Also go threw your meat and trim the fat off for your adobo, it will make all the difference. All their items are amazing you could order something new for a month and be happy everytime. My favorite is the pork adobo overload without the egg and a captain crunch snowbubble wich is to die for.</Text>

<Rate>2< /Rate><text>Pricy for the portions. Their surf and turf stated it was one of their most popular sellers. Meat was sparse and the garlic noodle didn't taste of much aside from grease. Teas was good and their kimchi fried rice was decent.< /text><GmapID>0x80850c7cb6354107:0xd1f0c6b69453a17< /GmapID><Name>Andrew Lam</Name>< time>

< review>
i ordered food from here 02/06/19, they forgot an item of food from my order, did not realize til i got home. the food that i did get, was disgustingly made. egg was burnt on the sisig fries, the fries were hard and undercooked. they also switched out their french fries with some cheap crinkle fries. they also stopped answering the phone when i complained and wanted to talk to someone</review>

Good food. Cheap but delicious, and with a wide selection of flavored teas. Best taken to go, as it's small and loud inside.</review>

You can drinks and snacks, lots of trash cans to keep it clean and plenty of life guards around which is great. Only warning is wear water shoes or prepare to burn your feet, ground gets very hot between water areas!</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNO07D752rGN7zWMwcOGMgAHG4e2ZUwBSGFA2hH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics>< resp>

If... WHEN it's hot as the center of an oven gets this is the place to go. Be sure to follow their IG to know if there is a private event or not. Be careful on the hot pavement I saw it cook an egg once< /Text>

A hidden gem in this small town💎

Tips:

Come early to get the nice shade spots with the beach chairs. (Ask the life guard for more chairs if you need it)

They prefer you make reservation before coming in, it’s located in the website. Random “Walk-ins” is not recommended due to limited capacity.

The “fancy tent area with curtains and soft chairs” are not free, they charge $15/hr & $45/day.

The lazy water is closed down until June...

They have a concession standing for snacks and drinks plus swim diapers, life vest, etc...

There’s swimming pool for all ages and a splash pad!

Entrance fee is $8/person if you not a resident of El Centro..

The staffs are super friendly!

Overall it is a great way to spend couple hours during the hot summer months!< /text>

<Review>I love the Pizza in this place. Prices are affordable, and you can't get full will a Pizza. If you are not hungry I suggest sharing the Pizza between two people. In addition, the environment is cool. You might find college students working on their assignments while eating pizza. The service is pretty fast so at most your will have to wait 10 minutes.</Review>< Pics>

The "publish your own" pizza lets you make a custom pizza with unlimited toppings for only $8.5. There are a ton of options, and it's really good!< /Review>

This place is good. The prices for the pizza are very reasonable. $8.50 to "Publish your own" which means you can create your pizza with as many toppings you want. The pizza crust is thin and crunchy. Overall the people that work here are very friendly, the service is really great. They serve beer here as well. Topping selection is decent and include several unique items I haven't seen at similar places like rosemary. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because I like Blaze better. But definitely a place to visit and try!</Text>

This place was great! We got a couple pizza's and two salads everything was very good and the ingredients were fresh! The employees were friendly helpful and polite!
The only thing I didn't like was the salad dressing, I hate dressing out of a bag it's nasty!
My favorite part was the cookie! Amazing! Crispy on the outside soft in the middle! I'm still thinking about that cookie days later! Lol< /review>< Date>

A great place to satisfy your pizza cravings! This is a popular spot for Pasadena City College students to study and hang out. They even offer a special deal when you show your PCC ID. The pizza is always very good and the staff is very friendly and helpful. I find my self trying new toppings every time I go. Would recommend.<//Review>

Build your own pizza for 9 dollars. There doesn't seem to be a topping limit. Is there really anything else to say? 9 dollars! I've had Blaze Pizza and Mod Pizza a few times each before, and Pizza Press is, personally, my favorite of the three. Spicy red sauce is the way to go, and there are more than enough topping choices. Oh, did I mention 9 dollars!?!</Review>

<Review>If I say it's perfect I wouldn't be fair, because five stars and "perfect" aren't enough to describe this place.

Food is awesome, the staff is hipper friendly and welcoming. The theme "vintage news" is nostalgic and exciting.

Love this place! Dont think twice before visiting. It's not "el cheapo" but also not expensive and it's worth every cent.<//Review>< user_id>

The theme of the place is of a newspaper printing business. You walk in and ask either for a Publish Your Own Pizza or a specialty pizza. You go along the line of ingredients and they put your pizza into a rolling oven. Theres more toppings available after it's been cooked. There's a brief guessing game as to which pizza is yours and then you pay. I went during lunch hour on a Thursday and it was a bit busy; line took about 15 minutes. Other than that, good pizza. I'll definitely be coming back.<//review>

<text>My credit card didn't work for some reason. It felt bad. I called my wife so she can find out why. I was forced to use my debit card in the meantime. While putting in my email address for my receipt the person who waited on me said, "If you are typing in your number it's not a good sign." He was suggesting that I could not pay for my order. I felt like his comment was condescending and racially motivated. I already left a 15% Tip and immediately regretted that decision. The one star was for the food. I went back in because I forgot the cookies I purchased to be stared at by all the white patrons that I didn't realize was behind me. I never felt that way before going to this Pizza Press in Padadena. This person seemed new as I have never seen him before. The entire transaction went well up until that point. Perhaps it isn't what he intended but that's what he made me feel. Don't know if I will go back.</text>< Pics>

<Text>The employees here are incredibly nice and helpful. The pizza oven is a bit loud so it is difficult for them to hear you, but that is sort of inevitable. The pizza here is pretty good, though pretty expensive unless you want to completely load it up with toppings.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80c2c3538e62e13f:0xc62a8de3a37fc696</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good pizza, variety of topping.  Great beer selection - Stone had a takeover the night I was there.  The crowd is a bit young for this old guy, but I would go again.< /review>

There's so many pizza in this area which mean better for pizza lover.  This place you can create you own pizza or had they create for you in their signature choice.  The dough js quite good and pretty good price.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>You can get great pizza at a great price considering that you can put as many toppings as you want on the $8.50 ''publish your own'' pizza. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it can be slow depending on the experience level of different staff members. They have a lot of beer, but I don't drink beer, do I can't say much about that. The coffee on tap is expensive, but it's really, really strong if that's what you want.< /Review>< Pics>

Decent pizza, but this place is heavily under staffed, long lines and wait.</Review>

< Review>
Amazing pizza concept, you make your own personalized pizza with much ingredients as you like. The crew is very nice and friendly. They also have amazing beers and wines.

My recommendation of pizza is:

Pink sauce
Artichokes
Pepperoni
Caramelized onions
Tomatoes
Spinach
Muzzarella Feta
Pesto
Chimi churri
Cilantro
Scallions< /Review>

Excellent service and delicious combinations paired with craft beer and killer chocolate chip cookies! Save your money by skipping the ice cream sandwich and just getting two cookies, the ice cream is not up to par with these delicious chewy cookies.</Text>

Better of the 'make your own pizza' chains. A tad pricier than the others though, but is more generous with ingredients.<//Text>

<text>Understaffed. Stood and waited with no service for 10 minutes while the single employee cooked pizzas and worked the register. A 2nd employee did come out, but then vanished in the back.

(Translated by Google) I like the place, the thin crust pizza and the attention. When I go to Pasadena, he stopped by Pizza Press

(Translated by Google) Very delicious freshly baked pizza.
I visited Pasadena for sightseeing.
It can also be taken home, so it is recommended for evening meals.

とても美味しい焼きたてのピザがいただけます。
私は観光でパサディナに訪れました。
持ち帰りもできるので、夜食にもおすすめです。<//review>

I was offered a couple of nights lodging at the UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center. When David, with the inside-scoop mentioned that it was 'Swank', I of course decided to give it a try. Google maps directed me into the loading dock at first, until I was able to discover the Guest Parking, located beneath the building,  accessible via a down-ramp that is adjacent to the guest drop-off / pick-up zone loop. The lobby is modern, warm, spacious with paneled details interspersed and appointed with gracious textures. The lobby has several work station areas available for guests. I was warmly greeted by the front desk staff, with comprehensive health safety protocols. The room was easily accessible from the security room-key enabled elevators. Echoing the modern motif, the room was tidy, with entry table, wardobe (with safe), integrated dresser, counter, desk & work chair, and large HDTV along the long wall, a comfortable reading chair, and king sized bed with side tables,  opposite. Numerous and well placed light fixtures facilitated getting comfortable. The bathroom is spacious with large lovely border-lit mirror and walk-in shower. The room was quite quiet :-) ...Thanks so very much for the ample hospitality and attention to detail...Thanks David, all of my 'Swank'  expectations have been exceeded!< /text>

Due to covid there is no room service. You have to make your own bed everyday. Breakfast is great. Parking is onsite $32/ per day. If you are visiting UCLA this is the best option. Very convenient.</Text>

Very good food topped up the stay. Being within UCLA campus was a great advantage. I understand that they don’t have service during the stay but they should have an automatic supply of coffee pods, towels etc... left at the doorsteps every night.< /text>

Such a fun experience at the California Academy of Sciences! Went with my family and we all enjoyed ourselves. Plenty of exhibits there, we especially liked the Philippine Coral Reef and the earthquake simulator. The staff there was so friendly too! Would definitely want to make a trip back to San Francisco to see everything over again!</text>

We went here yesterday for our son's eleventh birthday. The exhibits are truly amazing. The rainforest dome, the albino aligator and the penguins were my favorites, not to mention the gorgeous 'Living Roof.' The food in the cafeteria is a bit pricey, but tastes incredible. My artichoke and wheatberry salad was excellent. The entire staff is also super friendly and eager to answer any questions you may have about the exhibits. My only complaint would have to be the fact that this place is expensive as heck. After the cost of admission and a meal at the cafeteria, a family of four can easily spend over three hundred bucks. All in all though, a great experience...just expect to be charged an arm and a leg.< /Review>

I used to love grabbing a drink at this bar and business meetings were easy to coordinate. After a lengthy remodel it's lost a bit of the flair from before. The seating feels a bit cafeteria like and the coziness is gone. The menu is still nice and the staff pleasant.< /Review>

Brandly new and very nice Conference Center. Went there for a two-hour lecture. We were told that the hotel has 250 rooms. Huge. Lobby is classical. Staff are very friendly. But just never sent the IT person that we need indeed. 😂<//Review>

This was a beautiful conference center and hotel. The rooms were lovely, even having bathrobes.

The conference services for the conference I attended were amazing as well. I'm assuming the center was responsible for the catering and refreshments, but whoever did it provided a great selection and plenty of it.<//review>

Great place to stay. The staff was really nice and is in a great location. You stay right next to a bunch of cool buildings.also it is a short walk to westwood. In the third floor, there is a terrace where you have a great view of the campus and you can see the football team practicing. The room was fine but you don't spend do much time at the room.<//Review>

I just received word from our daughter that she and a fellow UCLA student were just kicked out of your lobby, which was not busy in the least.  We are considering staying at your hotel during our next visit, but we will need to reconsider because of how they were treated, which I was told was not professional or kindly.  Because I was told that tuition also goes toward Luskin, we are very confused.  Is this a posted policy?  And unless students are disruptive to guests, why wouldn't they be allowed to study in there, which is part of their campus?<//Text>

Staying at the Luskin Conference Center for UCLA's Alumni Day to kick off its Centennial Celebration was an outstanding experience!  Every staffer we encountered -- from restaurant servers to front desk workers to housekeeping personnel -- were friendly, helpful and accommodating.

Love this new building at UCLA. They have many conference rooms, a bar, and a cafe. They also have wifi and a nice hotel inside.  The bartenders were very friendly, however, the host on Saturday morning was rude. I wish I could remember her name.
I had good drinks at the bar and sat in the lobby to enjoy them. Nice conference center.</Review>

Plateia has one of my favorite sandwiches of all time: the chicken bacon avocado sandwich. The bread is toasted to perfection, the juicy chicken is marinated with delicious herbs, the avocado is smashed with lemon to brighten it up and the bacon adds a lovely crunch. Can’t go wrong with the tricolore side salad or the crispy Parmesan fries either.< /Review>

<review>Stayed at the Luskin Conference Center for a 2 night stay for a work event. The staff was accommodating and friendly. The room was the perfect size for a single occupant. My only critique was that the pillows for the king size bed was 4 small squared pillows rather than rectangle shaped. I found myself falling off the pillow in the middle of the night if I rolled over. No big deal though. I enjoyed my stay and would be happy to return for a future stay.<//review>< pics>

Such a comfortable and happy conference center. You eat so well, sleep so well. Very clean large comfortable room. Beautiful terrace with fireplaces and olive trees. Super friendly staff. Mr. Luskin was kind enough to come say hi to the participants of the headache conference. He was so positive and welcoming. It has a gym. For $12 you can get a voucher to the ucla gym too. It has free overnight parking. Great location too. Theres free wifi and coffee in the room. I love this place!< /Review>

We were there for 2 nights in May 2019. The entire facility, inside and outside, is beautiful, including our room. Tastefully decorated and relaxing. The food in the restaurant, Plateia was delicious, including the room service we ordered. Any staff that we encountered, from the front desk associates to the cleaning personnel were so pleasant and helpful. We needed to order something for our room and it was delivered with minutes.  I highly encourage anyone considering staying here to do so. We really enjoyed our stay.</Text>

The room size is VERY hit and miss. You can reserve a double queen size room and sometimes you get a nice comfortable room. Other times, you get a shoe box. I am writing this review from a shoe box right now and am not happy. I can't even fit my suitcase in the closet and had to move the coffee service table to make room for it, as we have two large suitcases with very little space to put them. Unfortunately, the bathroom floor in our room also had LONG BLACK HAIR ALL OVER IT and other junk. Housekeeping came and used a lint roller to clean it and what came up was gross :(< /Text>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I made a reservation a few weeks in advance and when I arrived tonight I had a big surprise. On the website, there are several price options based on your affiliation to the university. One of the options, the most expensive one, is for people like me - no connection. My family and I are just visiting and booked one room for one night. I arrived at the front desk to check in and was told that I will stay in a certain room. I mentioned that I booked a room with two beds. The employee replied that the room I booked is not available because they are overbooked. I made a comment like, “I have a child and we would really appreciate a room with two beds.” He didn’t really care and said there is nothing he can do. He offered to pay for a room at a different hotel. I explained that we have a baby that needs to sleep solos and it would be difficult to start searching for a hotel at this hour. I asked to speak with a manager and he replied, “I am the manager.” “I don’t know how the system works, but what is the point of booking a room if it cannot be guaranteed and if people overbook?” He was definitely upset by my question. He asked what brings us in the area and I said we are visiting the area. To which he replied, “You do not qualify to stay in our hotel because you have to come here specifically to visit UCLA.” Technically, I should have said that I came to visit the UCLA campus and it would have been okay. The true reason though, I asked too many questions and he didn’t like it. Luckily we found a nice hotel within a mile, at a lower rate. UCLA has a great reputation but the first impression is definitely not great.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2bc8602a90341:0xd73874d4f138751a</Gmap_id>< Name>

Finally had the chance to enter the elusive hotel of Gene Block because of a banquet.

Venue was very nice, super modern and well designed. Definitely felt like a very high class place. Our banquet was in one of the conference rooms and everything was very nice -- set tables and catering.

Food was pretty good! Was surprised by how the catering was decent. Had fish, roasted vegetables, chicken, soup, and a variety of desserts. Honestly, wanted seconds but I was too full after one plate.

Anyway, very nice venue and would recommend for event planning.</Text>

<Text>Really upscale and nice place!! Lots of amenities for guests and the staff is all super nice (and there is a no tipping policy throughout the hotel including valet, restaurant, and bar). My only complaint was that there is a charge if you'd like a mini fridge and I did not find this out until checkout. You'd think a place this nice would offer one for free, but even if they're going to charge, I wish they made it more clear. Other than that, a truly wonderful stay! A legendary property that I would absolutely return to.< /Text>< pics>

<review>My daughter was having surgery at the Ronald Reagan Medical Center and I could not recommend this place more.  They were so amazing and efficient and kind.   I was tapped out emotionally due to my daughter's medical issues and I was a complete basket case.  I was a ball of nerves and tears.  I needed food and I needed sleep.  I was just a mess, and they were so kind and accommodating.   Truly amazing.   Further, this was just a quick 7 minute walk to the hospital.  It was convenient and perfect for our needs.<//review><rate>5</rate></record>

It was definitely nice when we got inside and we waited patiently to be checked in to finally get into our rooms. But we had to wait a bit due to the front desk attendant having to deal with a situation and being the only one at the desk. Than my boyfriend was not appearing on the system so we had to deal with that situation too. It was stressful, but once we got it sorted out and into our assigned rooms, it was an enjoyable experience with the facilities.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< userid>

The elevator was hard to figure out for many guests. You have to hold your key card on a sensor below the floor numbers and wait for the light to turn green.

Location is good. Well serviced by transit for out-of-towners coming from nearby, easy to find. Decor and style is nice, fairly standard for a business class hotel and conference center. Staff are friendly and helpful, rooms are nice. Digital signs help guide conference guests and keep the schedules up to date. One small complaint, those signs are on a loop displaying the various info, in my opinion too slowly though. Ideally, one could swipe through the pages, but that's really nitpicking.</review>

Hotel is nice, beds were very comfortable, but we usually just stay at UCLA Meyer and Renee Luskin Conference Center and not the regency and you get soo much more not here. Internet, water, breakfast, parking are all extra costs. IT is however near everything, walk to nightlife, restaurants, cabs. Bathrooms were super clean.</Text>

The Luskin is extremely nice and we'll thought-out. Their breakfast is possibly the best I've ever had at a hotel. It is extremely close to Pauley Pavilion and many restaurants in Westwood.</review>

<review>The location is smack-dab in the middle of campus. The rooms are generally nice, clean, and comfortable, but they're on the smaller side. The hotel staff are nice, friendly people but the weird dynamic between the conference center and the restaurant, Plateia, results in frustratingly unaccommodating situations during lunch/dinner breaks for the staff of conferences held here.</review>< pics>

<Text>I stayed there for an academic conference, and the clear consensus at the conference is that this is the most pleasant University hotel any of us had seen.

Highlights: Solidly good, moderately priced New American food in the lobby; art everywhere, some of which is almost genuinely interesting; lots of sustainability-oriented details; beautiful front patio; walkable to pretty much all of campus.<//Text>< pics>

I stayed here for a week during a workshop. The staff is courteous, friendly, and professional. Every inch of the hotel is well-designed and immaculate. Because of its central location, everything was just a short walk away. The beds were comfortable, and the rooms included Bluetooth clock-radios/speakers, robes, Kuereg machines with K-cups, large TVs, comfortable beds, and nice dressers.</text>

<Review>Really nice rooms. And that's about  it. Rude staff, especially in the breakfast-area, many strange rules for the guests, no communication between different departments in the hotel = lots of misunderstandings, and last but not least- check your credit card now and then , since they tend  to charge you for others purchases.  Not a happy guest.< /Review><resp>None</resp>< pictures>
