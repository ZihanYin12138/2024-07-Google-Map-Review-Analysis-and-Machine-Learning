Loved that you can build your own Salad or choose from the many different varieties they have and also you can upgrade your salad and make it a wrap instead in a whole wheat flour tortilla</review>

<review>This place is good ! The food is great .. The reason behind the three stars is I noticed that they charge you if you want a different kind of cheese even thou it comes with cheese... Then when I ask for extra and pay for extra , you don't get extra. Also charge if u switch meats too .. Also ... Employees are very nice and helpful !</review>< Time>

<Review>I love this place.  The salads are really big,  so many toppings to customize, all the ingredients are fresh, and I really like how finely chopped everything is. Yes, it's a bit pricey for a salad, but it's more of a whole meal than just a salad.  Highly recommend it.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>We are hooked on this place. After the first time we had a salad (the chop Cobb) we kept talking about it and wanting to go back. I particularly enjoy the way the salad is prepared chopped evenly with a taste of every ingredient in each bite. A fast, healthy and tasty alternative to your daily lunch. There’s so much to try!</Review>< Pics>

<review>Glad there is a salad franchise in the High Desert finally. We used to like a similar place called Baker Brothers in Dallas. This type of salad shop fills a niche between a full buffet and a soup/salad place. Cost is between 10 and 12 dollars. Makes a good lunch stop.< /review>< Pics>

They are always clean.  I was amazed at they customer service.  They messed up and order.  The manager checked the cameras and called me back within 30 mintues, apologized and compted the next meal without any hassle.  Haven't had cs like that in a loooooooong time.</review>

Food price is to expensive. I ordered what the cashier suggested. I was very disappointed. There was enough chicken in the salad. I spoke to the manager he said I hope you come back again. It's not worth the price.< /Text>

I was obsessed with Tabu Shabu when i discovered it in Carlsbad, went back 3x on that mini getaway. There’s something about the freshness of eating shabu shabu (hot pot) that is so satisfying.

Then Tabu Shabu takes it an extra step, they transform your leftovers into an Asian Risotto... creamy, delicious, and mouth-wateringly good.

Service was great at this Huntington Harbour location in an outdoor mall by Trader Joe’s. They play upbeat music, keep the space sanitized and comfortable, they seat parties in pods, constant attention given with extra condiments, serving utensils, monitoring your broth, super hot sauce drops in your dipping sauce upon request, etc.

We got the grass fed prime beef regular size and tonkotsu broth or spicy miso / tonkotsu mix.

Bountiful set of fresh veggies that you can choose to customise, my daughter only got broccoli, spinach and tofu.

My teenage nephew inhaled his first round of beef, so we got him another set of beef..

It’s a lot of food, so i always have a lot of leftovers. They take your leftover broth, add rice, add more broth over and over until it thickens. Then add an egg and chilli garlic sauce and other yummy stuff, and sesame seeds.. omg.. it’s so good that i dream about eating it.

Highly recommend!<//review>

<text>Service is top notch.  Food is very good.  I've been to all the local shabu places and this is my favorite by far.  Hole in the wall vibe but modern clean place.  They remember my family when we come in, and treat us like Kings.  Keep this place going guys it's a hidden treasure!<//text>< Pictures>

Fancy shabu for westerners. If you want an authentic experience do not go here. Not worth the price point for the miniscule amount of food given. Do yourselves a favor and Google "all you can eat shabu shabu."</review>

It was my first time here, and all I can say that it’s amazing! The food and the customer service were, hands down, the best! We had the pleasure of Brian assisting us today, and he did such a great job.  Rather than feeling like a stranger, Brian made us feel like we were at home with all his suggestions and aid! It is bar seating only, but even if you don’t like that you’ll have a good time.  Not a huge fan of bar seating, so when I came in and saw that I was like “uh-oh!”, but it did not bother me at ALL! long story shot, I LOVE THIS PLACE!
10 out of 10, I would come here again!</review>

The waitress was very nice and kind to explain us how Shabu worked, we also followed her recommendation on food choices and our meal was delicious. Meat and veggies were fresh. We will go back soon.</text>

Incredible! Very lovely, clean and the motel itself is either renovated or brand new. The rooms are very nice, bath and shower work perfectly, you even have a fridge and a good working AC. Would recommend plus you get free muffin and coffee in the morning.</text>

There is ONE thing I need from an inn, and that is a quiet night's rest in comfortable surroundings - and that is EXACTLY what Mayfair provided.

The inn is QUIET, partly because of the concrete building and partly because it is a smaller property (fewer rooms = less traffic, fewer neighbors, and less noise).  A quiet night's rest, perfect!

The rooms are tidy, the cleanliness was good, all rooms are non-smoking (no stale cigarette smell), and the views of the nearby mountains are impressive.  There's a TV, a fridge/freezer, microwave.  Truly comfortable and I'd stay again.< /text>

Its actually called the Mayfair Motel. In front is a building that looks like a dump...very miss leading and I wasn't sure what the Mayfair Motel would be like. But its fantastic!! Super clean rooms and well kept place. My room had a big bathroom with shower and "clean" tub lots of hot water. Color tv, AC/heater and only $55 a night ! Not to mention the staff was super friendly, made me feel right at home.<//review>

It was really good for the most part Stayed 5 days it was  very clean however the only problem we had was  the innkeeper , he was not very congenial maybe he’s not much of a talker says  sister bought the motel and renovated it which yes it is was very nice and clean  however he was not very friendly and we had to ask for a roll of toilet paper everyday while we were there, we wanted to extend our day acuple more days and he said they were going to be closed on Monday and Tuesday until his sister overheard the conversation and insisted we stay the extra days which we did ! We never heard of a motel closing  for 2 days  .Like I said he was not too friendly , asking for anything extra like towels, ice ,TP was such an unconvinced  to him , not very friendly but overall for the price and cleanliness it was very good I would stay again but bring my own TP and ask to have my linens changed and to have more towel access !< /Text>

<Text>This is a small, but very clean and professional motel. The reception was open when I arrived at 10pm on Thursday in March. There is free coffee, tea and pastry in the morning. Air conditioning, warm water, clean towels, small shampoos. WiFi was slow, but ok for simple search and email.< /Text>< Resp>

Comfortable clean room with nice bed and shower, perfect for staying the night on our way to Death Valley NP, without the high cost or staying in a teepee.  Nice staff, very accommodating. Good value, nice mountain vistas.<//review>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>Rooms are tiny but clean and do serve there purpose if you just need some rest or want to get cleaned up after the long desert stretch or after coming down from KM on your they-hike. I’m giving it 3 stars not because of anything wrong but because of room size and the cost compared to other places I’ve stayed while on the trail for around the same price of $55 and with better accommodations however because it’s the only option before you reach Ridgecrest it adds to the value of the rooms. I would definitely recommend if you’re just passing thru and only want a good nights rest and a cleaning and you don’t mind being a little cramped but if you require more space or more services then I recommend you go to Ridgecrest about 8 miles east on 178. Classic Burgers is good fast food cooked to serve right down the road.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c10c6436f7b0ab:0x16a0405b05426df4</gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><user_name>Anonymous Person< /user_name></record></dataset><record>

Clean, polite and quiet.  Well worth the $ if you want to sleep and you don't need a penthouse suite.</review>

<Text>Clean, great value, comfortable bed, and friendly people. Good place to stay if near Ridgecrest.

My room included a mini-fridge and a microwave, which is nice. I will definitely stay again, just hope they improve the Wifi signal, as it was weak in my room across the parking lot from the main office.</Text>< resp>

Small but cosy retro motel with phenomenal customer service and the cutest little welcome pup.
My room was small but everything worked properly, and it was incredibly clean! They serve coffee and pastries in the morning. Ample parking,  no road noise at night,  and plenty of places around to walk my dogs. There is a very reasonable pet fee.
A few restaurants around but I didn't try them.</Review>

Modest motel with very small rooms, but everything we needed at a great price! Microwave, fridge, good heater/A.C.. Very clean with friendly staff. The price to cleanliness ratio would be hard to beat.. Coffee & Danish breafast. Empty this time of year, so I'm not sure about the sound proofing of the walls.<//Review>

<Text>Very, very very clean (little small though) room and bathroom. Property is well maintained. Nice guy at the front desk. My only complaint is that there were no amenities or whatsoever, not even an ice machine! Luckily there is a gas station on walking distance that sells ice.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c10c6436f7b0ab:0x16a0405b05426df4< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Very clean and a very comfortable bed. Also direct t.v.
The room was small, about 10 x 10 feet and a small bath with shower.
I thought the cost of the room was a bit high ($55) but last moment deal.< /review>

<response>None< /response><review>Friendly people helped us at the desk, room was clean and basic amenities were all there. Bathroom was nice and spaceous and great watterpressure! Only thing I found annoying was the lack of option to turn on bathroom light without the superloud fan, made a nightly tinkle enjoyable for everyone in the remote area. We stayed a night to pass through to Death Valley. The coffee and pastries at the desk in the morning came as a surprise! Great experience for a great price.<//review>< date>

(Translated by Google) This place is the absolute joke, the air conditioning, fridge too loud. I do not understand why you under the bed sheet undergoes something like a slide, every time you turn you wake up and I think that most are not bedwetting. We moved out at 1:30 am and drove in a 3 star hotel, much better.

(Original)
Diese Unterkunft ist der absolute Witz, die Klimaanlage, Kühlschrank viel zu laut. Ich verstehe nicht warum man unter dem Bettlaken so etwas wie eine Folie unterzieht, jedes Mal beim drehen wird man wach und ich denke das die meisten auch keine Bettnässer sind. Wir sind um 1:30 Uhr nachts ausgezogen und in einem 3 Sterne Hotel gefahren, deutlich besser.< /text>

(Translated by Google) Typical American motel, all very simple but clean. Convenient on the parks director: Death's Vally and Sequoia. Good price and very kind staff; a minimum breakfast is included in the price. If you arrive late there is the option to order something prepackaged and heated them in the microwave (even this modest price). To be taken into consideration if passing through the area.

(Original)
Tipico motel americano, tutto molto semplice ma pulito. Comodo sulla direttrice dei parchi: Death's Vally e Sequoia. Prezzo buono e personale gentilissimo; nel prezzo è compresa una minima colazione. Se si arriva tardi c'è la possibilità di ordinare qualcosa di preconfezionato e riscaldato nel loro forno a microonde (anche questo a modico prezzo). Da prendere in considerazione se si passa in zona.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Motel American style, but very very clean and cared for. The position slightly further from the death valley saves a lot of money. The only flaw climate and noisy fridge, but you can not sleep anyway.

(Original)
Motel in stile americano, ma molto molto pulito e curato. La posizione leggermente più distante dalla death valley permette di risparmiare un bel po' di soldi. Unica pecca il clima e frigo rumorosi, ma si riesce a dormire comunque.</text>

<Review>(Translated by Google) The value for money is rather less good. The staff is unmotivated and rude. The rooms are clean, but smell very chlorine. The bathroom is big. The beds were ok, but we lacked a blanket or we did not find these. Unfortunately, the air conditioning is too loud to sleep well. On the whole, the hotel is rather not recommended.

(Original)
Das Preis- Leistungsverhältnis ist eher weniger gut. Das Personal ist unmotiviert und unfreundlich. Die Zimmer sind sauber, riechen jedoch sehr nach Chlor. Das Bad ist gross. Die Betten waren ok, jedoch fehlte uns eine Decke bzw. wir haben diese nicht gefunden. Leider ist die Klimaanlage viel zu laut um gut durchschlafen zu können. Im Grossen und Ganzen ist das Hotel eher nicht zu empfehlen.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

<text>(Translated by Google) We made the reservation at 7 o'clock in the afternoon, escaping from the hotel that we had for that night that had been a disaster, and it could not be better !! The room was a small size (as seen in the photos) but correct for one night. The super comfortable bed, with pillows with which we slept great, large bathroom, bright and clean. We had two bottles of water in the room that we had at no charge and breakfast (which was included), although simple (based on coffee and various pastries) did the job. We took advantage of the chairs on the terrace to have breakfast with the fresh air of the morning and it could not have been a better idea !! We would repeat without hesitation and recommend it as an option to take into account if you pass through Death Valley.

(Original)
Hicimos la reserva a las 7 de la tarde,  escapando del hotel que teniamos para esa noche que habia sido un desastre, y no pudo ser mejor!! La habitación era de un tamaño pequeño (como se ve en las fotos) pero correcta para pasar una noche. La cama super cómoda, con almohadas con las que dormimos genial, baño grande, luminoso y limpio. Teniamos dos botellas de agua en la habitación de las que dispusimos sin cargo y el desayuno (que iba incluido) aunque sencillo (a base de café y bollería variada) cumplió con su cometido. Nosotros aprovechamos las sillas de la terracita para desayunar con el fresco de la mañana y no pudo ser mejor idea!! Repetiríamos sin dudarlo y lo recomendamos como opción a tener en cuenta si pasas por Death Valley.<//text>< resp>

Just your run of the mill ARCO. But they do have competitive gas prices for the area! Can't go wrong with a giant ARCO, can you?< /Review>

ARCO is the only place to go for gas. Sometimes the facilities aren't quite as ritzy as other places, but definitely save yourself the money and find one near you.</text>

There was no re rolling fingers over and over and over again because the print didnt take..Magic i tell ya lol 1st time ..i will be back bc i know I'll be doing another live scan again soon<//text>

{'time': 1607796243552, 'text': "Hi Eli,\n9 out of 10 people won't know what CTEC. In dealing with live scan, we come across a lot of acronyms for different type of employments and industries (HCS, IHSS, RN, RCFE, and the list goes on).\n\nBut it's okay, as long as you have your live scan form with an ORI # located at the top left, it will give us exactly what you are looking for, the PRICING of your specific live scan, regardless of what acronym your your industry uses.\n\n(P.S. To be fair, the lady you spoke to did ask you specifically for that ORI# so she can get your price.)"}< /response>

I came to this location based on the good reviews and I live in Inglewood.  I arrived without an appointment last week and was taken care of within 20 minutes. Not bad considering it's tax season! Will recommend.</text>

<Review>Before I continue, I'm only reviewing the State Foods Market in Coalinga. I didn't know it was a small chain until I researched it. I just moved to Coalinga and this is my go to store. Prices are great and the workers are awesome. Sure, not nearly as many specialty items, but for groceries it's the best in town. I shop another big chain for special stuff, but that's maybe 5-10% of things I can't live without. Walk through, check prices, call me a liar. Love this place.<//Review>< Time>

I enjoy going to this store only thing is that some of the "employees" don't bother asking you if you would like a bag. You literally have to tell them and ask for one.< /review>

But the one here in Avenal, California is nerely three times the size of the Coalinga, location. With a liquor section, a meat market, and a decent produce department. It also has household hardware and a remarkable seasoning erea. Now the prices are a little steep, but it's where I go when I need something.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I tried using because I could do a video conference with a celebrity , because there was an event, it did not work at all. I clicked join the event and them clicked on the link and it showed me nothing. I spent a lot of money for this event. What a disappointment! They don't even have a customer service for customers. SUCH A SCAM AND A RIP OFF!!!!
Hope this site closes down and no one uses it ever again.<//text><resp>None</resp>< Name>

We had an event that needed postponed due to Covid. We have now decide to cancel the event and give full refund to our guests. Eventbrite has locked our dashboard, so we can not make changes and have taken all our tickets sales and wont allow us to have a refund. To refund our guests it now has to come out of our own pocket. We have tried to contact them anyway way we can and NO response. And their contact page does not work.< /Review>

Horrible horrible company. Our event was cancelled but we were never notified by Eventbrite or the organizer. We found out about it from the Facebook event page.

I contacted Eventbrite and they said to go to the organizer. Well guess what the organizer filed bankruptcy in March and rescheduled the event to a date after which refunds were not possible.

I went back to Eventbrite and they said sorry nothing they could do. I found out today that these con artists have a form to fill out to get a refund. Their terms make it all but impossible to get a refund, this form was not there when I called the first time.

NEVER EVER use these con artists. It sucks because some events and groups I am a part of use these grifters. I refuse to give a single penny of my money to them. Looks like I will miss out on stuff for the groups I am with.< /Review>

<text>I had an event postpone indefinitely due to Covid. I have tried contacting the event organized, zero response. I tried contacting Eventbrite through a request form, all I received was a generic email back. I’ve tried looking for a phone number or email address to reply to, cannot locate on their website. Very disappointed with their handling of event changes.< /text>< pics>

Tried to sign up for a vaccine registration time and Eventbrite failed. I selected a registration time and went to check out but it was stuck on loading. Then it kicked me back to the original page to select a time again but all the times were sold out. Disappointed I won’t be receiving a vaccine tomorrow because of Eventbrite.< /text>

Could not resolve my issue.  Could not talk to a live person.  Refused to re-issue a check for more than $3,000 even though they have admitted the 1st check HAS NOT been cashed.< /review>

Horrible experience. Wish they allowed negative stars.
Booked tickets for an event on a 'certain' date. Organizer 'lean agile solution' postponed the event. Provided new dates and asked if I could attend or need refund. Said would take '3-5' business days for the refund. I opted to get a refund since the 'new dates' wouldn't work for me. Its been more than 8 business days and I didn't receive any confirmation about the refund status. Forget about the actual refund. Going to involve my bank and get the charge disputed.
Stay away from  Lean Agile Solution as well as eventbrite. They are running a scam/fraud.<//review>

My boyfriend and I went on the Wine and Chocolate cruise in SF bay , it was nice to be out on the water BUT the boat was way too crowded. The actual cruise doesn't match the marketing , the chocolate and wine were tiny little samples to make you pay for a whole bottle or box of chocolates.....not worth it</Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x808f7fd78deaa7e9:0xe26b934e835a6889</gmap_id></record>

Hated it, because they did not provide a secure, trustworthy product.

Another entity was allowed to create another page, duplicating our information, and linking it to their account.  They posted their prices at half our official pricing, and they had no authority to do so.  Used the same venue, same date, same time, same talent, same image, same text... but made it lower, so people would go to their page and purchase, instead of our official page.

Search my key words, and up pops, another unauthorized page selling tickets right under ours, for half the price.

How does Eventbrite deal with this?  They help cause more confusion, buy telling buyers they bought a fake ticket... Now, I don't know about you (my fellow event producers), but do you think if you were told you bought a fake ticket, you would trust the company and purchase another ticket on the same site?

ON TOP OF THIS... AFTER THEY REMOVED IT... IT HAPPENED AGAIN 1 WEEK LATER.
I'M IN SHOCK, AND IT IS TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.

Beware.  They cannot guarantee that this won't happen to you.  Do a high profile competitive event, and allow this to happen to you on their site...  Anyone have a solid company that insures that this wouldn't happen to you, please let me know, because in my opinion, Eventbrite can't handle large value events.<//Text>

If a ZERO is possible I would give it to eventbrite! I have not been able to access my account for a week and they have a customer service person name Michelle who refuses to provide me any type of customer service than to tell
Me to log into and account I can’t get into because I no longer have access to the email!!!!!  Or to check their Help Center!

This is not a free service because they make money off of ticket sales! This is completely unacceptable. Get me tech support to get into my account.< /text>

Subway nice place for sandwiches. I like to get the  Turkey  Bacon  Avocado with pepper jack cheese...of course toasted. Add some lettuces, avocado jalapeños musterd, also get the miss Vikie's jalapeño chips and a coke. Wow, that's a sandwich. Yummy. The service is very friendly.  The stuff makes me feel welcome:)<//review>

<Review>I normally don’t eat at subway at all but I decided to stop over to get a veggie sandwich with soup on the side.. I found a long string of hair inside my soup. God sakes the  subway  franchise needs to be shut down. There are better deli sandwiches out there.</Review>< Pics>

Such horrible service... stuff was rude... my little sister was telling the girl what she wanted on her sandwich  and instead of paying attention she kept talking to the guy next to her and then proceeded to ask again what she wanted on her sandwich... it was so annoying.<//Text>

< review>
I've been to this subway over 50 times and I've never had any problem until recently. There is a employee who is a female (i would describe her as Arabian or Muslim). She is extremely unprofessional, super slow, and EXTREMELY stingy with the vegetables (lettuce, spinach, pickles, etc) and the sauces (mayo, mustang, ranch, etc). She has made my sandwich a couple times and every time i have problems with her. She acts like she is paying for the vegetables and sauces, extremely stingy, especially when you ask for more. This lady also has a bad attitude and cannot seem to understand or hear what people are saying. I've asked for multiples of something and she will only give one every time and i have to re ask. This is not the type of person who should be working at a subway.  Customer Satisfaction is the last thing on her mind. I'm giving the actual store 5 stars because it is a great subway besides this employee.<//review>

The manager always helps with our order and my kids like this guy. I keep forgetting his name but he always remembers our order, and we are a family of 6. I appreciate his hard work to accmidate my family. He needs a raise.</review>

<rating>4<//rating><Review>Employees are polite but not excessively so (nor do I expect them to be), sandwiches are well made and location is as clean as can be expected. I see lots of negative comments on this location, but to tell you the truth as a former fast food employee myself people usually don't say anything unless they're going to say something bad. Keep up the good work guys and thanks.

As far as complaints about portions go, the portions are determined by weight from the corporate office. You can order "double meat" for an additional fee but there's no Subway that's just going to give you "more" meat, the idea is ludicrous. Your issue is really with the company and not the location.<//Review>< Pictures>

<Text>The sandwiches ARE fresh. The prices are excessive. They have stopped making the jalapeño/cheese bread. They have felt the drop in business. They have cheap specials and the sandwich of the day promotions now<//Text><gmap_id>0x80c34cb7dc8972b3:0xdfca4f38c9c5379a</gmap_id>< Date>

<text>I eat at Subway regularly because of work. I avoid this one when I work near-by it is the worst Subway I have ever been to. The employees are rude and unprofessional, they give you skimpy portions, and the tuna looks like clam chowder.</text>< pics>

This is by far the worst subway I have ever eaten at! My sandwich was all crumbly and falling apart! Crummy bread! The employees were extremely rude and disrespectful! Plus they charged me $10 for a sandwich that cost $6 I will avoid this subway in the future at all costs!!!< /review>

Lazy and loud workers. All 3 employees talk instead of serving your food. Very unpleasant vibes and one of the female worker cussed out the security guard.<//review>

They do have cheaply priced decor, bedding and etc..  Unfortunately there are the "ghetto" attitudes of other patrons.  So a quick in and out and early morning shopping is suggested.< /Review><Time>1550435252067<//Time></record></dataset><record>

Could use customer service training. Could use better customer service. Certain employees need not cater to certain customers and treat every customer the same and or accordingly. This establishment could also benefit from having security outside. Parking is not secure, had a friend whose truck lock was tampered with while shopping.<//text>

Awful customer service. The cashier are so rude. They need to find a job in a basement that way they don’t have to talk to anyone.   And Dallas should should hire better staff.  Is a job but they should be grateful.  They are getting paid right???</review>

A nice man helped me track down a cart in the busy store when I was just about to give up and leave due to not being able to shop holding a baby and holding items. I did my shopping and had a huge bag then he offered to help me to my car. Thankful to get the last bit of shopping done in one store due to this. Made my day so much easier! Even the young lady at the counter had a smile on her face.</review>< response>

Great prices for some quality items. Clothes are pretty nice, but I would recommend washing them. Has an off-smell, but is overall a good store. Would recommend.<//Review>

I found what I was looking for but this store in particular had plumbing problems-- the worst odor I've smelled gave me whiplash a few steps into the location. The major inconvenience was worth the cheap t-shirts regardless. I still think Fallas should have fitting rooms.< /text>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Store employee tried to steal my stroller then lied said they didnt have it and laughed in my face when i went back looking for it the next day. I told her i would be contacting her manager and she kicked me out then got her bf to come out of the store and get in my husbands face harrassing us while i had my baby in my arms following us in the parking lot trying to get physical. We called the police and contacted the district manager to complain. I spoke to the store manager 3 weeks later and guess what??? They "found" my stroller! Wow and after all that they didnt fire that lying ignorant cashier with the big mouth. . . . LAST TIME I GO THERE.</text>< pictures>

This is by far the worst store. What kind of clothes store doesn't have a changing room and won't let out of state shoppers use the restroom to try on clothes. The clothes are so thin they have wholes in them in a wash or 2. But the lack of customer care is just too much!</review>

<text>Bad service
Every one is moody
We didn't get help from anyone
Dirty fitting rooms
Cashiers gossiping about the the store and other employees and didn't attend us untill we said something
Some lady didn't help us but got mad because we  were looking at pants
Thank you

Jerry is very accommodating and pleasant. He has gone out of his way numerous times for our company. He arrives with a huge smile and great personality. He smells pleasant and always looks very well put together. He truly is an asset to this company and has been one of the best technicians we have had in the 11yrs I’ve been here. Jerry is a true example of what all your employees should follow for protocol. Thank you for sending him to our business to rid us of our pesky furry friends. We no longer have rodent issues as we did in the past. We absolutely love Jerry here... doesn’t hurt he is always nice looking too!!!< /review>

We have had roach issues since my niece brought them over with her. Tried for months to get rid of them ourselves, but they just got worse. I honestly didn’t think we could ever get rid of them, so I called around and went with Truly Nolan because of the great reviews! I’m glad I did!! Kevin is awesome, and since day 1 has handled it in the most professional manner. He is very confident from the start and knows his stuff! After just one treatment, we seen a 70-80% improvement, and with follow ups, we are almost roach free! Thank you so much Kevin!! You deserve 5+ stars!! You have given us our quality of life back. I would definitely recommend Truly Nolan, and request for Kevin!<//review>

<review>Rob was our technician who arrived early & on time. The truck was spotless & he had a very neat appearance, polite. His knowledge of the the work to be done was impressive. Rob & the two other technicians work hard & fast to complete the large amount of work in one day. We have many pets including a parrot that they worked around & kept us informed as to when to move them to allow them to complete their work. This has been a very pleasant process thanks to Janet, Rob & crew.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

I have to say that Jerry Deel is absolutely Amazing, he is very thorough and always polite and on time. I have staff that has told me nothing but good things about Jerry if he comes in and interacts with them. I would give him 10 stars if it was possible. This guy is also so professional.< /review>

Over the last few months I have seen the population of roaches decline, unfortunately they have not disappeared.  While your employees are unfailingly polite and show good customer service,   Those cursed roaches are still around.  It is as if the little stinkers have developed an immunity to whatever you are using and laughing all the way.< /review>

<text>We have had Truly Nolen performing our pest control for the past 10-15 years. I am very happy with our results. We have not had any problems with ants since our service began.
We had our quarterly service performed yesterday and I would like to give huge kudos to our technician. I have milkweed plants to promote the increase in the Monarch butterfly population. Our technician, Kevin, left me a note saying that he avoided spraying anything on my plants "because everyone likes butterflies" as he realized the insecticide could hurt the development and health of my caterpillars/butterflies this spring. I thought this was so thoughtful and most certainly appreciated. Thanks Kevin and Truly Nolen.<//text>< pictures>

Kevin is an amazing technician. He is very knowledgeable and very helpful.  My husband and I are both cancer survivors and he works with us closely to customized our service so we are totally comfortable.   He not only has an impressive work ethic, he also truly cares. We've had Truly Nolan for over 20years and Kevin is by far one of our favorite techs. He is a credit to your company and represents you in a professional yet compassionate manner at all times. I sure what ever your paying him it's not enough.< /review>

Originally when I set up an account they said we could be in the house when they did the inside. When the technician arrived he said we had to be out of the house for 4 hours after he sprayed the inside so I will probably never utilize the inside option even though I’m paying for it. That’s my only complaint this was the first time using this company so not sure what future appointments will look like<//text>

Truly Nolen trully cares!!! I had a not so happy experience and wrote a review about it and sooner then later had Janet give me a followup call.  What an amazing person she is and shes awesome at her customer service, listening and understanding skills.  She has eased my concerns.  I also do have to say that the product that is being used around my house is working.  I see a huge difference in the pest population.
Thank you again.<//Text>

Truly Nolen are the greatest! We have dirty neighbors( we live in a condominium) and started to get roaches overflowing from the neighbors unit. We were in a panic, since we thought they will never go away.

We called Truly Nolen and scheduled an appointment for a consultation. The consultant (Richard) was an expert, and not just in his career but also in customer service(super nice, kind, and friendly)He inspected our whole house, and gave us a plan of action to get rid of the roach problem. He answered every question we had with thorough knowledge and precise detail. We gladly and confidently signed to have Truly Nolen treat our problem.

A few days later we met the tech Kevin( he was awesome!). He came to our house and created an aggressive yet safe approach( because we have 10 month old puppy) in eliminating our roach problem. Kevin was super knowledgeable, friendly, and in expert in his profession.

We have not had one roach since Richard and Kevin came. We highly recommended their services to anyone looking at their reviews</review>

Wow I called 4 total Pest Control Companies, before I decided On Truly Nolen Temecula.  Buddy Jones was the most prompt   and thorough of all Inspections I had. I was ready to tent and be done with it.
My contract/ estimate for Tenting was at least 10% less than all others. Although Buddy felt so strong spot treating would work, I opted to try this with Truly Nolen’s guarantee, if I need to tent due to infestation that could not be eradicated, they would deduct what I paid to date and TENT at preset contract price.
The Technician’s Robert and Jerry on time and were the cleanest and most conscientious duel I have every met. I felt as though I had another complete re-inspection. No mess and didn’t have to move out for 3 days.
Thank You, Truly Nolan

It is one of the best decision we ever made. WE are so grateful for the phone call a day head of our treatment. Our Technician calls to advised he is on his way. We had some questions back a few months ago, within 24 hours there was a Technician at our Home. WE are very Happy we chose Truly Nolan Pest & Termite Control to take care of all our Pest Control needs.

Customer service by Juan Verduzco is wonderful. If I have any concerns he is always willing to help, he is friendly and easy to approach. Example I have small children and I get wasp nest under my eaves. If I call Truly Nolen and let them know that I have a problem Juan comes out within a few hours or the next day. Which is wonderful I had other pest control company and they would take a week or 10 days before they would come and knock down the wasp nest which of course is very dangers to my sons!!!  Like I said my service guy (Juan) is outstanding!!!< /review>

During my search for a termite control service I narrowed the field down to three.  From that I selected Truly Nolen.  I'm sure I made the right decision.  Scott Tring  was the Service Coordinator during our initial termite control process, from beginning to end.  I found Scott to be friendly and easy to talk with.  He explained everything in detail.  During this process I also met Robert and Mica, both were informative and friendly.  All three of the Truly Nolen people seemed to know their job and explained things about the process.  I am so impressed with Truly Nolen people and their work that I made arrangements  to continue our association by entering into a long term pest control agreement.  I will encourage those in need to retain Truly Nolen.</text>

<text>I have been very happy with Truly Nolan taking care of our pest issues.  We live rurally, and have had issues.  They have been responsive.  In particular, Robert has been great!  I learned so much from him on looking more closely for gaps under the house and how to close those off.  Very grateful.  He is very knowledgeable and happy to share his knowledge.

They sent out Robert Beckman to do a liquid preventative treatment and he was fast, courteous and knowledgeable. He finished my house in a matter of a couple hours and we didn't have to leave. Overall, I'm glad we went with this company. They offer a year guarantee that covers spot treatments if we find anymore termites at our house, free of charge. That is a great peace of mind.</text></record></dataset><record>

I have always received nice and friendly service from everyone I contact.  From scheduling my date of service to the technician at my home.  Friendly and professional.
I have moved from a previous house that was serviced by Truly Nolen and had to have service at the new one.  They make a difference each season since they know what bug to look for each time. Thank you Truly Nolen!<//Text>

Brandon (the Manager) visited our home and gave us a very detailed explanation of what we were dealing with and what steps they would take to eliminate the termite infestation. Several days later Robert (the technician) and Allen (his assistant) went through our home and spent several hours treating the infestation and ridding our home of termite infestation. We were so pleased with their professionalism that we signed up for their quarterly pest control service. Really happy with them.</Review>

I would really like to thank Richard as well as Robert. Finding out you have termites and you have to tent your home along with finding the means to do so with all kinds of added expenses is a major pain. However, when you have a company with good guys like these two, who actually take the time and care it really dulls the blow. We had a few inexcussable hiccups in the process with the subcontracted company (Your way pest control) I'm still compelled to give these 2 men a 5 star rating. Especially Richard! He was absolutely amazing during this process. He really cares about the client. Thank you guys very much for all your hard work and  perseverance through this tough time.
I would however highly recommend checking into the ratings of the subcontractors that are used to keep this company's good name standing firm. Thank you again for everything again & Keep up the good work, it does not go unnoticed. 😊</review>

I told her I called for a estimate  on service  and she said ok what kinda service  and I asked if they were a pest control  company  and she said yes with attitude . I told ok I need prices on your service and need to know what services  you guys have  . She got mad and what kind of pest do you have . Isn't it usually  how it goes when someone tells you what they are calling about you tell them what you need they greet you and tell you what they have to offer . They were so unprofessionally so I just hung up.</text>< Pictures>

He called to give us the time he would arrive. He was on time in fact 10 minutes early.
During the entire time he was performing his job, he was extremely professional, friendly, courteous, and very helpful in answering any question we had. He was one of the hardest workers I have ever hired to do work for me. I did not see him once take any extended break, although we offered him coffee, water, etc.
You can take pride in having him as one of your employees.

I would also like to commend the original employee Steve McLaurin, your Service Coordinator, who came to inspect and give us his recommendations. We were extremely pleased with his advice and suggested methods of treating our termite problems. He was very friendly, professional, and did not try to sell us something we did not want or feel we did not need to solve the problem. He was also very helpful in changing our planned days of work to be performed for various problems.
We are pleased with your Company in every way and would highly recommend you to others.

Excellent pest control company. The employees always professionally with their services. And always call ahead of time to let u know when they r coming out to spray, always shows up on time. And they make sure all of the pest stays away. If you see any type of pest after they have sprayed you give them a call n they come back out n take care of it. I will highly recommend to anyone looking for a pest control company.</text>

<Review>Scott Tring has helped us resolve pest issues at more than one address. The most recent was for a termite inspection required for a home sale. He always keeps things uncomplicated and gets straight to the solution. In the past we have been visited by bed bugs, Argentina ants, etc.
Scott  quickly responds to our calls, as do the technicians, most recently Justin Isom, and previously Juan Verduzco  who are so dedicated.  We appreciate how Truly Nolan is consistently efficient and does not apply treatment in excess which is something we experienced with other companies.</Review>< gmap_id>

<Review>So far they have been nothing but excellent from the time I first called looking for something. The woman I spoke with was incredibly nice and walked me through the process. The gentleman who came to the house spent some time talking with my elderly father and myself and did not try to upsell us on things we did not need. I appreciated that they cared more about our needs then what would line their pockets. The technicians who have come out (twice so far) have been wonderful. I do love the reminders you get when it't time for service, the phone call check in, and the ability to not have to be home when it is just spraying down the outside. The difference it has made in the spider problem we had is amazing and it is now safe for my father in law to be outside.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80dc9e3328ea2f81:0x9168fb95ad1d52b0<//gmapID></record>

We had a great experience with pest control, Truly Nolen. We had to have permite treatment in our house and our rep Robert Beckman was very friendly and professional.
He even arrived on time..and that is rare with service people.  We usually end up waiting home all day. I would recommend this company if you need termite or pest control service. Thanks Robert!<//Text>

The technician I had, Jimmy, and his crew were incredibly professional, courteous, and knowledgeable. Job was supposed to be a simple add of some ceiling fans, and deleting half-hot outlets. Jimmy and crew found some other critical electrical issues that needed immediate attention, to include adding a sub-panel to my existing service, and investigating a frightening neutral-ground shared outlet, and adding a bathroom exhaust fan. The crew went out of their way to make every effort to clean up room by room as they worked, and even worked quietly and around my infant son’s nap schedule. This is the second time I have used Point Loma Electric and Plumbing (the first was for two complete bathroom remodels). I highly recommend this company for their customer service and professional conduct, and will continue to use them in the future.< /review>

<Text>Curtis and Kennedy was very professional friendly and respectful. They followed the Covid guideline (masks).  Also they showed respect for our property. They wore the shoe liners and cleaned up after the work was done. We liked working with Curtis and Kennedy because they were knowledgeable and gave us ideas of  improvement, especially Curtis.  Overall,
we were very happy with the work they performed at our property.<//Text><UserId.>106165159755446437697</UserId.>< time>

I was in need of some electrical upgrades and found Point Loma through a web search. After researching the company I called and explained the scope of the job. The company set up an appointment for an estimate and James came out to look. James arrived on time and was professional and thorough in his quote. The company kept me updated during the whole process and installed everything on time and exactly as quoted. I highly recommend this company and will be using them in the future.< /review>

<Date>1627266260955</Date><Review>I had the pleasure of having your electrician, Curtis Gordon, work in my home on Friday. He was extremely professional, courteous and very knowledgeable. He listened to all my questions and concerns and answered all of them. I have had many workers in my home, and he totally raised the bar of the quality of workers! He continuously praised your company, and was obviously proud to be a part of it. He quickly went from room to room up grading most of my electrical outlets. He left no messes, and apologized to have to cut some tile in my kitchen. When he finished, there was no tile looking different. Marvelous quality! He is a true asset and representative of Point Loma Electric Co. Sincerely, Sarah Merschtina< /Review>< pics>

<Review>Anthony came to do an electric repair which we determined was not worth doing, but then he asked if there was anything else we needed. We had a problem with a bathroom faucet. Anthony said he also was a plumber and did a great job fixing the faucet. He knew what was wrong and explained what was needed to fix it. We agreed to have him do the repair which was done professionally. He was amiable, professional and a good representative of his company. I recommend Point Loma Electrical and Plumbing.< /Review>< pics>

There is a reason they continue to receive 5 stars; they have a true focus on customer service and hire not only skilled electricians but ones who communicate and listen. My technicians were Hector and Lalo they took the extra steps and time to ensure I understand the options available to me. They were on time, honest and cleaned up after themselves.  I appreciated the communication regarding the upcoming appointment and arrival time of the technician; freed me up to do other tasks. I also appreciated that I received the name and picture of the technician who was coming to my house.<//Text>

<Review>First able, after I contacted them, it was very quickly and easy to schedule. I had no power on my home and Aaron arrived quickly at my property. He was a very nice and respectful, but more than that, he checked that all the outlets had the proper installation and repaired the ones I needed it. I will definitely recommend this business in the future!</Review><username>Elena Betancourt</username>< time>

From the start, they were very professional and they gave us a fixed price for the work. Frankie and Magda came out, yesterday, and were very considerate in how they setup and asked where to put their tools. They got the first bathroom done and moved onto the second. There they ran into some problems with the way the wiring was originally done and it was not up to code. They tried multiple ways to get the light working, but they could not. They explained the situation to me and promised to be back to get it right. Which Frankie and Hector did today. On both days, they did a great job of cleaning up and they were very tolerant of our crazy young dog who wanted to see what they were doing. I would definitely use them again.< /Text><Name>Jeff Coleman<//Name>< pics>

What a great experience it was working with point loma electric and plumbing. They were able to come out quickly and fix my drain problem.  Robert is the BEST plumber I have ever dealt with.  i have an older house and he was very experienced. He knew what to do and took care of it. He is very professional and didn't sound like a salesman.
I would absolutely recommend this company to anyone. Very happy.</Text>

<review>The technician from Point Loma Electric, Kennedy Desouza, and others that assisted him did a wonderful job at our home. They were friendly, efficient and tidy as they worked to install outlets,  motion sensor lights, recessed lighting and repair other  electrical items that were long overdue to be repaired.
We would be comfortable to have them return when we need electrical services again and recommend them to our friends and neighbors.<//review>< GmapID>

The team showed up on time, was courteous, worked efficiently, and informed me every step of the way during the install of my new quiet cool fan.  Great customer service and really enjoyed the crew.   Would recommend their service to anyone looking for a whole house fan installation.

<text>We had Anthony Zarco do an excellent job fixing our ceiling light. I’ve called to get estimates to fix exhaust fans in 2 of my bathrooms . But ,fortunately  he asked me if I have any other problems that has to be fixed and did not think about it and up fixing my lights in the kitchen which was excellent. He spent his time testing it and searching for problem and explaining and showing. And next day he came and fixed. Thank you Anthony. I will definitely will call them for my next project.<//text><date>1624077469156</date>< user_name>

Requested service to diagnose possible circuit being powered by two breakers.  Technician arrived within time given and was extremely professional. Point Loma offers a quick free inspection of various receptacles and offer additional recommendations.  Although we could not replicate my issue, he still went through and verified everything was good.

Only small issue is the no time frame of having a technician arrive upon scheduling.  Having to wait for a call throughout the day to get a 30-45 minute heads up is rather inconvenient.</Review>

<Review>I have used this company for both electric and plumbing. Nick, Frankie  and Mark are all professional, friendly and knowledgeable about their field. They offered valuable suggestions to improve and upgrade my house. They arrived on time, kept me informed with all the details while working and left my house in good shape after work was performed. Customer service is also friendly and very efficient. I have recommended their services to several of my neighbors who are looking for great service. I highly recommend!<//Review>< pics>

<text>Nicholas was fantastic. He came in for a quote and took the time to explain the work, to as k for future plans so he would install for that and fully understand the scope of what we were looking to accomplish. His GM worked with me on pricing to get where we were comfortable and then executed perfect ly in a very timely manner. His customer service skills and general demeanor made us very comfortable. I would use Point Loma Electric again in a heartbeat. Professional is the perfect word to describe this experience.< /text><Time>1610411204104<//Time>< rating>

My water heater died and I called Point Loma Electric and Plumbing to help me out. They were super busy and short staffed due to Easter holiday but still managed to get someone to my house Friday morning to replace my water heater before the weekend.

< Review>
The light's weren't working in my Mom's bedroom and three other areas of her home. She's a senior, in a wheel-chair and currently hospitalized. Thanks to techician Rich, she'll return home to a fully lit home.  Rich was prompt, listened and fixed the problem fast. Turns out the problem was a loosen screw which was identified in her bedroom where I requested he replace a broken socket.  Rich was able to resolve and isolate the problem to a single room because he listened to his customer. In the end, that saved my mom $$$.  Other companies tried to sell us a new electrical panel which was not necessary right now. Thanks for responding quickly and. settling the billing issue fast.  I'd recommend, Rich and Point Loma Electrical to family, friends and my rental business assiciates.< /Review>

Nicholas and Frankie were recommended by our neighbors who raved about their quality of work, responsiveness, and professionalism. So we specifically requested both of them to install several vaulted light fixtures and recessed LED’s.

Nicholas came by multiple times to discuss how the job would go, various options, and even gave us 3 different quotes depending on what all we decided on having done.

We decided on the work and the day. Nicholas and Frankie showed up on time, made sure to check with us regarding the placement of the recessed lights before cutting, and constantly made sure we were happy with the plan and progress. They cleaned up after themselves professionally and the patch work looks adequate.

Overall, I would highly recommend both of them for installation of interior lights and recessed LED’s.< /Text>

<review>I applied For an Electrician position job in this Company but I didn't get hired, But, it's ok because I learned lots in few hours from this Company ! I really impressed with their hiring process and with the way they treat their employees!! It's awesome, they really care about safety, the Safety is not just a word in this business place, it's also done very well so all their employees and Supervisors are very aware of safety and care about each other and about costumers

I am taking my time and writing this review because I believe everyone deserves to know about this company and should have no hesitation hire them and trust them because they really care about YOU.

Thanks To Mr Kyle< /review>< time>

Called in the morning and they had a technician here before noon. Rich was professional and fixed the issue quickly and efficiently. Point Loma Electric has COVID standards that are visible on their website, which is important from a customer standpoint. Pricing seemed competitive. Would definitely call them again for electrical issues!</Review>

<text>Unfortunately, we had an experience that felt genuine at the beginning, but ended up being a disappointing one. We called an electrician at Point Loma Electric & Plumbing because our electricity was down in half the house. Although we had an older panel, our wires were recently installed, but the electrician did not explain that until after the service. He could have been honest and told us the needed service (changing a breaker) versus the $2,500 service to change a panel and make sure they weren’t double tapped (no new wires).<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>{'time': 1611854648753, 'text': "We are very sorry to learn you are feeling this way.  After reviewing your invoice, job photos and the technicians notes I can confirm that you had a Zinsco panel that was in poor condition with double tapped breakers.  Double tapped means that multiple wires are placed on a single circuit breaker rather than individual circuits each on their own breaker.  Zinsco panels are considered hazardous and lost their UL listing over 30 years ago and absolutely should be replaced.  We will always recommend replacement of the panel and not just a breaker under these circumstances. The electrician did discuss this with you and explained the scope of work and cost; according to our records you agreed to the work being done.  He then completed the job exactly as explained and agreed. There is far more involved than simply the cost of a panel and this pricing is in line with what other comparable companies charge for this scope of work.  All breakers were also replaced and the wires were properly re-landed in the new panel.  The wires do not need to be replaced unless they are in poor condition (and that would cost more) and there is no reason to re route them.  I apologize if the scope of work wasn't explained to your complete understanding, however the work was done as  necessary and as agreed and was indeed needed.  Your technician and our company take great pride in our integrity and workmanship and would not recommend or charge for work unless it was needed and approved.\nPlease feel free to reach out to me directly if you have additional questions or would like further explanation.\nSincerely,\nJamie Hunley\nOwner, Point Loma Electric & Plumbing"}<//response>< gmapID>

We have a new building where installations are a little tricky.  We did some research for electricians and were fortunate we were led to Point Loma Electric and Plumbing.  From the first call and giving us a quote in a timely manner, to scheduling a appointment it was all done efficiently.  Our technicians were excellent.  We had Anthony Zarco and Patrick install our fan and we cannot say enough great things about them.  We now have this company down as a resource for future reference.<//text>

Anthony installed my sauna for me. First of all I’ve always wanted my own personal home sauna. He initially came out and help me figure out how he run the wires to box, and installed 220v plug. His work is impeccable, very personable, professional, show up on time and did a phenomenal job. I highly recommend him, and if I ever need anything electrical I will gladly wait for him to do it!

I appreciate that he didn't lock in to the one thing I called about, but was also interested in supporting us with other needs if we had them (rather than having to make another appointment.)

If you are like me and are fearful, or smart, and not into electrocuting yourself doing home projects then this is the business to call. Responsive, professional and the work is done by honest good people. From the people who answer the phones to Kyle, the GM, everyone was wonderful to speak with. James and his associate came out for an evaluation, he gave me multiple avenues to approach the issue and at a price that I felt was reasonable.

Issue: Breaker blew, lost power to multiple areas of the house. Had too much power on one breaker.

Diagnosis: Wire broke or sparked off in the wall due to my previous renovations. Needed new circuit put in to have a stand alone for kitchen appliance.

Solution: Ran new wiring, new circuit and went ahead put in a sub panel since mine was outdated. Plus they put in few extra empty breakers upon my request.

The project took one day, got texts/calls WITH A PICTURE OF ELECTRICIAN. Which I thought was a phenomenal security procedure implemented. Overall, give them a call, to get a quote is free anyways!< /Review>

We have used Point Loma Electric & Plumbing in the past, and had them out again recently.  The technician who came out to our house, Rich Cowan, was professional, friendly, and knowledgeable in his trade, and was able to address our concerns.  Thank you!<//Review>

Point Loma Electric and Plumbing are a very customer service forward company. The plumbing technician was very adept at his job as well as explaining the work to the layperson. Care and clean up was as much a priority as the job itself. The saying goes "you get what you pay for," and I believe we got a bit more than we paid for in the affirmative. I would highly recommend Point Loma Electric and Plumbing to anyone who needs their services.</Text>

Wonderful costumer service! William and James arrived on time and both were extremely professional and very kind. They answered all my questions. I needed a quote on multiple things in my home for plumbing and electric and they gave me an estimate within 20 minutes. Thank you for your wonderful costumer service Point Loma!< /review>

I couldn't believe the professionalism and responsiveness for the electricians that came out to do work on our little condo.  It's an old place, built in 70's, and looked like it had electrical outlets that had been nearly untouched since then.  They came out, identified all the outlets that needed to be updated, respected our house by having shoe covers for while they did their work, moved any furniture necessary to work on the areas, and even took care of some other minor concerned with light switches and empty socket slots while they were out for us.  After a few hours had our place with fresh, snug sockets that properly held the devices we plugged into them.  They also provided a few quick estimates for some additional work projects we had questions about in our house with patience and professionalism.</Text>

<gmapID>0x80deaaeace53f4f5:0xe64fbf825b30e8fa</gmapID><text>So I had a 1958 bath in the master bathroom with fixtures that leaked and a tub that was a nightmare to clean. While the quote from Bath Planet was higher than I would have preferred (though when is that not true?), I think their professionalism, consideration, and the actual product made it totally worth it.

The office staff touched based enough that I always knew what step we were at in the process. The owner reached out to me when she heard that I was kind of freaked out by the amount of money I was committing, which really settled my nerves.

And then finally, when it comes to the installation, I think Gino and Jacob were the real stars of this process. They were considerate, friendly, and efficient. They were on time, the install happened according to plan, and they communicated every step of the process to me. Plus they cleaned up any debris so well, that I'm pretty sure the bathroom was cleaner after they left than before they arrived.</text>< Name>

<rate>5</rate><Text>Point Loma Electric & Plumbing has been a great business to work with!  I have used them for multiple services and have found each person that provided the service was consummate in their skills and professional in their delivery of service.  My home is over 50 years old and as a result, remodeling requires vendors that have that expertise.  Usually if not, they tend to oversell remedies that aren't always necessary.  I have found Point Loma E&P to not only NOT oversell, but to be honest, transparent and economical with their pricing.  I have had an electrical survey, electrical repairs & plumbing repairs.  They even turned me on to other vendors with similar practices for remodeling services that they do not handle in-house.  Overall, I feel extremely lucky to have found Point Loma E&P and have tossed business cards of like vendors.  Whether you have an older home or not.... Point Loma Electric & Plumbing is the only vendor to use!!< /Text>< pictures>

<review>Point Loma Electric installed two light fixtures, an outlet and four canned lights in our home. Electrical wiring adjustments were needed. The quality of equipment and Point Loma Electric employees work was outstanding.  Michael arrived on time for the scheduled appointment and reviewed the project with us. He provided a firm quote and we would expect no increase in cost. As we discussed and made changes from our initial work request, Michael rescheduled the job for early the next day and would bring a partner. Michael and Anthony arrived on time the following day and once again walked through the work order and kept us informed of any changes required throughout the day such as wire capping, light placement. We couldn’t be more pleased that Michael and Anthony took extra time to evaluate the entire install and found the best way as if our home was how they would have their home look. Before leaving, they did a rough finish of drywall and all dust all was cleaned up. I highly recommend Point Loma Electric. We found the workers to be knowledgeable, polite and workmanship to be superior.</review><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1574271397785, 'text': 'Thank you very much!

Point Loma Electric responded immediately to my electrical issues, which included the loss of power to major areas of my kitchen.  I was surprised, but pleased, that they came on President's holiday.

The two Electrician assigned to resolve  my issues arrived just as I had been advised.  They politely and professionally introduced themselves. They advised me of what they would being doing to resolve the issues,  how long it would likely take, and encouraged me to ask questions at any point while they worked.  They were respectful in every aspect of their assignments.

They worked diligently and persistently.

I have another significant electrical issue which I will ask Point Loma.  Electric to repair/update.< /text>

Called several electrical companies in San Diego...Point Loma Electric was the only business that came through, they were quick, responsive,  professional (ph, email, text communication). Really top notch! Mike Murphy was very professional, friendly and shared our concern. He fixed our issue within a short amount of time, for a reasonable fee. I would definitely recommend PL Electric.

We had Anthony come out and provide us with a quote for recessed LED lights in our living room. He took care and time to review the details with us before providing the quote. Their quote was a little on the high side, but we wanted quality work and they came through! Anthony and his partner technician Anthony both took their time to do the job right and make sure we were happy. We will us them again for our electrical needs. Thank you!<//Review>

Called on Sat 11/7 to fix toilet.  They made an appointment for Weds 11/11.  When they were supposed to show up, they called and cancelled and tried to schedule for 11/16 (8 days LATER!!!!!!!).  Are you kidding me.  These guys charge a premium and them are unresponsive TWICE.  I will never use them again.< /review>

Everyone we interacted with was very nice and courteous.  We called to get a quote to install and electric hot water heater with a heat pump.  The lady on the phone was very committed to scheduling us in and a few hours later, a plumber arrived to give us a quote.

I told the plumber we were interested in getting an electric hot water heater with a heat pump.  I added that we have solar so the solar would cover any electricity we used.  The plumber said, "Gas is so cheap.  Electricity is so expensive, you don't want to do that."  Here's where my experience went downhill.  By that comment, it was clear to me that the plumber didn't understand the new techology or was just trying to upsell me.

I got a quote for $4k to install a 50 gallon gas heater or $6k to install a tankless unit.  Two days after the initial visit, I got an itemized breakdown of their gas heater estimate (no itemized breakout for the $6k tankless estimate).  Labor for the regular gas heater was $1,800.  These costs are for all materials and labor.

Anyways, as I mentioned before, everyone I spoke with was nice and friendly.  I wish the plumber hadn't been so dismissive of the new techology and their prices weren't so high.  I ended up getting my electric/heat pump heater installed for about $1k + the cost of the unit $800.  That's correct, my total cost of $1,800 was equal to their labor installation cost.

Summary, nice people.  Seemingly prices on the higher end.<//text>

This is the second time we have used Mike Brito of Point Loma Electric and Plumbing.  The appointment setting is easy to do and the office folks are very nice and you are made aware of every step up to the technician's arrival.  Once here, Mike gave us honest advice on our electrical system and made recommendations to assess our immediate issues and items that will need help in the future.  He also provided an estimate on the spot.  We will evaluate it but in the past we have had him perform the services recommended.  Each time the repair and/or upgrade was completed completely, work place cleaned, and professional demeanor throughout. Everything was done right the first time.  It is refreshing to see a company that does not cut corners.  Thank you Mike!<//Review>

Mike arrived on time for the panel upgrade estimate and he took the time to answer all my questions. He made sure nothing was left unanswered or misunderstood. Really appreciated his patience. No selling speech, no BS. The multiple detailed estimates were done on the spot and sent via email immediately.

Only thing that could be improved is the $65 flat fee for just coming and doing the estimate. Understand why there is a fee but i think it could be a bit lower, like $30.< /review>< Resp>

<user_id>116961156906123892509</user_id><text>Aron and Richard ran lines from our sub panel in our guest bedroom out to the garage today. It seemed like a really challenging job, with multiple unexpected obstacles such as PVC, ducting, and studs. They worked hard ALL DAY drilling and fishing lines, troubleshooting and using their combined expertise and experience to resolve all the issues.  In the end they were able to minimize the number of drywall hatches they needed to cut (only 3) and gave us a neat, professional conduit and outlet in the garage to plug in our electric car.

Prior to this, Harley, Project Manager, took care of every concern and issue we had. We were traveling out of the country for large parts of this project, and Harley took the reins, communicating with our Home Owners Association, getting the city permits coordinated, and scheduling the inspection. What a relief!

THANK YOU Aaron and Richard, and Harley! Point Loma is a large, extremely professional company who knows how to get the job done. No fiddling around and delays, as we experienced with a smaller company just prior to getting fed up and calling Point Loma.  Highly recommend. Call them—you won’t regret it!</text><Name>Linda Walker< /Name>< gmap_id>

< review>
Starting a home project, especially one that involves plumbing, can be stressful. I've been putting it off for a while because it's so hard to decide on which company to go with to do the job. I came across this company and took a chance. I'm glad I did. The person that called to setup the appointment was very professional, and so was the person that called to inform me that person assigned was on their way. William Butler, was the person I met with and he took the time to offer options. He actively listened and acknowledged my situation. Not once did I feel discouraged from moving forward with the project. I have a clear view and understanding of what needs to happen and the decisions I make will come to me a lot easier because he took the time to help me understand a project like this. Before meeting with Will, I didn't know where to start. Now, I got a game plan going. Thank you Will! Everyone in your industry should follow your type of work ethic.</review>

Mike our electrician was professional from start to finish .  Very knowledgable,  very personable and polite. Kept me informed about any issues and cost.  I only looked at one electrical company but I knew Point Loma Electric had a good reputation, so I wasn't able to compare cost. But I was completely satisfied with their service and work.  I would use them again and specifically ask for Mike.  5 stars!< /Review>

Will showed up on time and greeted me with a COVID-19 care package for my personal usage. Will was very patient and listened to all the information I had gathered including looking at the pictures I had taken over a period of time concerning my issues and spent a considerable amount of time analyzing the situation before explaining his findings to me. I felt he investigated my possible water leak in the yard  quite professionally and reassured me that what I was seeing  was natural water drainage from the very wet weather we’ve had this year. He evaluated the French drain work I had put in myself and was very complementary. He gave me the number of a follow up leak detector if I was so interested in having that work done but felt it would be an unnecessary expense and I believe him. There was no service charge for his visit and I felt guilty not owing him anything. I would definitely call Will back if I had any other plumbing problems. Jason<//review>

<review>William and Martin helped me with a minor sink leak. Because the issue was so small, they gave me a discounted price and showed me how to fix it myself in the future. Great conversation the whole time as well. On time and got the job done quickly and efficiently. You can not get better service. I would give 6/5 stars if I could.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1554815596332, 'text': 'Thank you!

The whole experience was wonderful. The communication from the office, to the arrival of the tech. I needed a ceiling fan replaced. He explained what to expect and then did the work. Cleaned up after himself. It looks perfect! Will definitely request Hector for future work!</Text>

When it became apparent that it was actually a very simple fix (that I probably should have noticed and fixed myself), Mike did his best to keep the price down with a coupon, so I wouldn't be overcharged.  Even though I probably shouldn't have called for professional help that time, I will definitely be calling Point Loma Electric next time I have an electrical issue because Mike was so helpful and professional.<//Text>< Pictures>

Aaron and Anthony just completed installing 2 light fixtures, one in a bedroom and one in a bathroom. They also replace a faulty GFI outlet in the kitchen. All of their work was completed in a very timely manner, they explained everything they needed to do as well as some options with the particular fixtures we purchased, and they made sure we were satisfied with the completed work. They were each very professional in their work ethic and we wouldn't hesitate to have them back to complete some other projects. We have used Point Loma Electric on two other occasions on our recently purchased home and each time we have received high quality service.<//Text>

I was so happy with the work which was performed at my home.  I needed a new wall outlet installed and had no idea who to call.  I first talked to a handyman, and he thought I needed a licensed electrician.  Luckily, I made the right call.  I don't think any company would out perform Point Loma Electric and Plumbing.  The electrician was here on time and was very polite and courteous and truthful.  I don't know if I'll ever need to hire an electrician again, but if I do I will call the same company. It was a great experience!<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I recently purchased a dated condo and contacted Point Loma Electric on Yelp to see if they could help with some issues that came up during home inspection. Within hours I received a response, and one phone call later I had an appointment for inspection and estimate set up. Two days later, the electrician (Charlie) arrived on time to inspect and give estimate.

Charlie was able to inspect my electrical panel which needs replacement and outlet switches that were upside-down. He was able to provide an estimate on the spot for repairs. I always get several quotes before getting work done and the quote I received from Point Loma Electric was in-line with others. Given the great reviews online I decided to go forward with correcting the upside-down switches and the three way switch that was not wired correctly.

I was impressed with Charlie's level of knowledge on issues I had questions about and pride he took in his work. I feel like when he left I had a much better understanding of the electrical panel issue and how it needed to be corrected. I will most likely go with this company when I decide to get my panel replaced.

I'm working with other companies on plumbing issues and installing new flooring. It seems like everyone takes forever to respond, let alone quote or do work for a reasonable cost. I was impressed that Point Loma Electric seemed to be on the ball with everything. From the moment I requested a quote to the moment I ended the customer-satisfaction call after Charlie left, I was impressed. I will use this company again in the future when I need electrical work done.<//review>< pics>

<review>The Point Loma Team was fantastic! We had electrical issues that needed attention and a list of items that we wanted advice on. Charlie Holt, who is extremely knowledgeable, came out to go over the list; provided options and alternatives which were all accepted. He did not disappoint us. David and his team did an an outstanding job in doing the work! It took three days to complete this complex job. Everyone was timely, clean, and respectful of property. Nearly every room in this large 50 year old home was touched and we wanted additional outlets and lighting installed outside the home. Necessary damage to walls/ceilings were kept to a minimum. We could not be more please with the work. Clearly, Point Loma Electric is our go-to company for electrical needs. We may have paid for a Cadillac but got a Rolls Royce! Thank you!<//review>< pics>

Mike, the technician, was very professional, friendly, and knowledgeable. He replaced the broken, blown out back porch light light with a new one that we jointly picked out online from Home Depot. And I love it! He replaced my old worn out light switches in the laundry room and even replaced the light bulbs in my kitchen that I couldn't change myself because I could n't get the cover off. He was very helpful to say the least! I would call them again in the future!< /review>

Michael and Richard from Point Loma Electric replaced our landscape lights with LED fixtures and bulbs. Their professionalism showed off while trouble shooting the uneven voltage and broken sideway lights. Both of them are very patient and polite while explaining the issues and solutions. They are very careful with our plants and cleaned up after the job is done. My yard is much brighter and energy efficient now. Thanks to Michael and the Point Loma Electric team. We will definitely call them again with future electric projects.< /Text>

Mike Brito not only arrived at the scheduled time but was able to fix my issue the same day. He also educated me about why I was having electrical issues in the first place and how to mitigate them in the future. He was very nice, endearing and well educated on electricity.

<text>I had requested that an old shower pan be removed, the drain be repositioned, a new shower control valve and shower head be installed, and a new shower pan be installed.  Robert and his apprentice finished the plumbing job in less time than I had anticipated.  The quality of work was excellent and they did a satisfactory job of cleaning up their work area when finished.< /text><UserId.>101764960219812031248</UserId.><Resp>{'time': 1569889435931, 'text': 'Thank you!

<review>My Technician Mr. Roberto Ibarra was very professional, knowledge, and friendly. Mr. Ibarra made the process seamless, and recommended additional DIY maintenance to additional  life to existing appliances. I am a very satisfied customer and will definitely be doing with business with Pt. Loma electric & pluming in the future. Thank you< /review><user>112728875887913498248< /user>< name>

<Review>We had a great experience and felt very comfortable with our technicians, Aaron, Solomon, and Richard.  They were knowledgeable, professional and nice people.  Due to my add ons, we went from a 1 day to a 3 day project.  They stayed until the job was done and made sure it was done right.

<text>Greg, Michael, and Rolando were very competent and professional. Greg took the time to explain everything after he diagnosed the problem. They were respectful of cleanliness - they wore shoe protectors when in the house and cleaned everything up when they were finished working. We were impressed by their attention to detail and felt confident that the work had been done correctly when they were finished. They took the time to carefully test everything before leaving at the end of the day.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>I bought an EV and needed a dedicated 220-volt plug installed. I made an appointment and I was told the tech would be here to look at the job and complete it the same day if I approved. I told the person I talked to on the phone I work at 1030 each day so I needed them here early so I can get to work.

The installer came, gave me a reasonable price, and said he couldn’t do the work that day. We made another appointment for the installation to be complete. The next appointment day I received a call around 0800 telling me my installers would be at my house in 30 to 45 minutes. I reminded her that I had work and I was told by the installer he would be here at 0800.

An installer showed up with one of the leads to see what was going on and what they could do. The original tech that gave me the quote was not with them and he didn’t pass any information on. I explained what I needed, and they said they needed to order parts. My issue with this is I was told the parts were already being ordered and they would have them to install. A 3rd appointment was made.

The lead told me they would be here at 0800 so I could get to work. I get a call at 0745 and the message said they would be here in 30 minutes. I called back after an hour and I was told they are at the warehouse getting parts.

They had the job done in under 90 minutes. After they left I went to plug in the new charger and…….. the plug they installed was wrong. The lead took a picture of what plug I was using for my specific charger and said they would install that one.

I called after I calmed down and they sent someone out as soon as they could. He came, I showed him what I needed, and he went off to the parts warehouse.  He came back and installed the correct parts. He also had to re-do the work of the 2 guys here earlier that day, they didn’t run a 30 amp wire or something to that effect.

Everyone I talked to was friendly, polite, and professional, just never on time and lacked communication. They were the only company that came up on home advisor for installing EV related things or I would have told them not to come back and I would have hired someone else.

This took my whole day, I had to miss work at the , which cost me money. The reason for 2 stars is the last tech that came last had the integrity, and was honest enough, to fix something he saw wrong.<//text>< pics>

Everyone was great to work with, very professional from putting on booties each and every time entering the house to the expertise in the work that needed to be done to replace the sink properly without sacrificing the counter top.  I appreciated that they also brought several newer guys with the senior guys to participate in the work and learn special techniques that will obviously help them in future jobs.  Communication was great all along the process. Definitely recommend this company to anyone needing plumbing and/or electrical work.</text>

I called Point Loma Electric the day after Thanksgiving, hoping they could send someone out to my house right away to install a 240 volt outlet with 40 amp circuit in my 70+ year-old Point Loma home.  Not only were they able to do so, but Michael, the electrician, they sent, was great to work with. He understood immediately what needed to be done, made suggestions about where best to place it and how best to do it, left to obtain the needed parts, and returned and completed the work, all before the end of the day.  I'd definitely call them again.< /Text>

We had Will and Frankie work at our house.  It was a great experience!  They were very polite and well mannered throughout the day.  They thoroughly explained what they did.  They ran into complications because ours is an older house and although the project took a few hours longer, the price stayed the same!  And the guarantee is awesome!!   We will call them again :)< /Review>

I really appreciated the work performed by Greg, the electrician that visited my home from Point Loma Electric.

He did his homework in advance by reviewing the work that was previously done on my home to familiarize himself with the layout, and then did a nice clean job troubleshooting and fixing part one of my issue.

Because I have an electric car, I have some additional nuances that required additional knowledge and tracing. Greg used his expertise to not only help troubleshoot, but he also went the distance and stayed with me after he was done with his part, while I contacted the electric car charging station company to help with the next step in the troubleshooting, just to make sure I was completely resolved. I really appreciated that extra touch.

Exceptional customer service. Thank you, Greg!< /Text>

<Text>Aaron and Mike came right when they said they would, and were very courteous and professional. They went straight to work and found the problem with our electrical panel, explained my options to fix the problem along with the pros and cons of both. With no pressure at all they waited and listened while we talked it out and made our decision.
They also fixed another issue for me right away that was not part of the original reason we had called them. The extra work was done very quickly and we are extremely pleased with how they handled everything. I would recommend them to anyone who needs professional help with electrical issues, and we will be using them going forward for more electrical updates.<//Text>< user>

Mike & Richard were professional and courteous. They arrived on time and replaced the previously installed gable fan. They were great at explaining the process and were detail oriented. They were also kind enough to show me photos of the installation so I could see it without going in the attic. Thank you both.</Text>

We have had several plumbing projects in our older home which brought a new challenge with every new job.  The staff at Point Loma  Electric and Plumbing  have all been courteous, professional and polite.  Our plumbers Robert and Aaron made an awesome team!  I felt they had our best interest in mind at all times.  I  highly recommend this company.< /Review>

<Text>Had an electrical line in the backyard that got knicked and needed to be repaired. They came out and diagnosed it on a Friday afternoon and had it fixed by lunchtime on Monday.

<Text>The office called 30 minutes before the technician arrived, and he came in 30 minutes.  He was polite and made sure to wear booties to keep the carpet clean.  When he worked in an area, he put a drop cloth on the floor to protect the floor.  He did the work and after that he gave us an estimate of work we want done in the future.  The work is topnotch, and I recommend Point Loma Electric to everyone.<//Text>< gmapID>

Pt Loma Electric came out to replace a ceiling fan , fortunately they were able to repair the existing one thus saving us the cost of purchasing a new ceiling fan. They were prompt, efficient clean and respectful. They also provided quotes to us on various other projects we were considering in the house. There was no pressure just information.  We appreciated their work. Highly recommend considering them.</Review>

Mike Murphy did a full Electrical safety inspection and replaced outlets ect. as needed. Very timely and also gave quotes for Outdoor lighting and Quiet Cool system. Very knowledgably in all areas. Good Job!

The following week I had a Quiet Cool- Whole House Fan installed. the same person that quoted the job did the installation, Mike Murphy and an associate completed the job in about 4 hours , just in time for summer. It makes a big difference in my Condo and Pt. Loma did a great job on installation, taped off the entire area where the work was being done and told me all my options.</Review>

< review>
Charlie was extremely informative and professional during our appointment. He provided all options available for a service panel upgrade while pointing out the pros and cons of each choice. Additionally, despite not being a part of our original appointment, I asked him for an estimate of the Quiet Cool system and he took the time to go through those options as well.

My only disappointment is that my electrical service is underground and the company doesn't provide nor subcontract the trenching service necessary for that type of job. He was able to provide a name of a company that they have worked with in the past but wasn't able to personally vouch for the company's job quality, just that they have worked with them before.<//review>

I’ve had the pleasure of working with Robert. Him and the rest of the Point Loma Electric and Plumbing staff have been phenomenal!!

We’re replacing pipes and water heaters, we’re taking a 30 year old house and updating the plumbing and electric.

1) The staff is on top of it. From the techs to the office staff, I have had nothing but excellent service. When I requested a quote, they responded immediately. As I was doing research of other plumbing companies just to see the different estimates...it was over a week since the others replied...YEAH.
Based off their communication and prices, I had to go with PL.

2) They are extremely respectful and will help you understand what they’re doing and why they’re doing it so you’re informed. Robert has done an excellent job of teaching me what’s going on in the house and why certain things need to be replaced and why other things don’t need to. He’s reliable and goes above and beyond. His hard work shows and I feel comfortable having him work throughout the entire house.

3) The techs. Currently my family is going through a difficult time while we’re also gutting the house. While running an errand, I didn’t make it back in time after their lunch which delayed them and meant they couldn’t finish up. Instead of leaving me without water for the weekend or charging me for having to stay longer. The techs stayed and were able to make sure we had water. I have NEVER come across a company whether that be here in CA, OR or HI that has cared this much about completing the job properly and making sure their clients are treated with such care.

THANK YOU ALL AGAIN!!! I look forward to doing more work with you guys in the very near future :)< /Text>

Point Loma Electric is the best way to get electrical work done punctually and professionally.  I have used their services several times and they answer the phone and schedule an appointment immediately.

No other companies in the county have shown such attention to prompt and professional service...and we have tried many!

Highly recommended!<//Review>

<Text>Ramon is a true professional. I've had several bad experiences with electricians in the past, but Ramon has restored my faith in the trade.  He explained what was going on with my panel and the switch, and took care of it.  He also explained the difference between replacing and restoring the panel so that I can consider my options and make a decision soon.  I'm so glad I found Point Loma Electric and Ramon, and highly recommend them both!</Text>< name>

Point Loma electric is such an amazing family! They have the best customer service; I appreciate that they will always stand behind their work! From the awesome Bri in the office to Rolando installing our ceiling fan. This is the second job Point Loma electric has done for us from help with flickering lights to installing a ceiling fan, they will always treat you family! I would highly recommend Point Loma Electric!< /review>

I had PLEP install two ceiling fans in my home. One in the living room and one in my sons room. The quote was fast and accurate, and the person giving the quote was on time.

Bit of a story: I had to have the contractor install the fans while I was at work. When I got out to the house, it turns out the fans were installed in the wrong location and one of the switches didn't work. I'm 100% sure I mixed up the fans when I left them in the location I wanted them installed, but had called them back out because of the non-working switch. Of course the contractor apologized, fixed it, and then even fixed MY mistake. Legendary service.

I absolutely will do business with this company again, and will recommend it to anybody that needs an electrician.

A huge thank you to the whole crew!< /text>

<review>The installation service requested was done in an efficient and professional manner. The coordination between the front office and the field technicians cost them a star. I informed the front office of additional work and expected an estimate and information transfer to the field technician. The transfer did not occur but they were able to accomplish the additional work at the same visit.< /review><rate>4</rate>< name>

<review>Technician came over to my house and replaced a main circuit breaker.  Total price $553.00.  I felt taken advantage of.  I do not recommend or will I ever use Point Loma Electric again.<//review>< pics>

<response>{'time': 1567123235813, 'text': 'Patrick, We strive to deliver 5 star service to every customer and value all feedback.  Our electrician clearly expressed to you that if you didn\'t feel comfortable with our prices, there was absolutely no obligation to proceed and we would not charge you anything for the call.  He did also perform some extra repairs and troubleshooting at no charge in order to  go the extra mile for you.   We strive very hard to provide excellent services at fair prices which are based on many factors beyond the price of a part, including many costs of doing business in CA and providing our employees with a fair living wage.\n\nOur technicians take photos and write detailed notes about each job.\n\nHere are the job notes from this service call:\n\n"This call was to replace a 100 amp main breaker. When I arrived I let the customer’s explain what was going on with their electrical system. I verified the information that SDGE had told them and presented the price to replace the 100amp breaker. Once I presented the price , Patrick (Homeowner) started to yell at me over the pricing. He started to question how we come up with our pricing and that his other electrician would only charge him 150.00. I told the customer upfront that if he didn’t feel comfortable with our prices, he can choose to go with another company. He was not obligated to proceed with our company and there would be no charge for the service call today. He shouted, “No just get the job done!” He then signed work order and authorized me to proceed with work. As I was removing the bad breaker, Patrick started to shout that he was going to write a bad review about how overpriced our company was. After I installed the main breaker, I restored power and started to voltage check all the breakers. The main breaker was giving me the proper voltage. However, as I was going down the line a 20-amp breaker was instantly tripping. He informed me that that he attempted to install his own gfi’s in the backyard.  I told him that I would also replace the 20-amp breaker as a courtesy and perform a troubleshoot to try to fix the problem at no charge. I replaced the breaker and the circuit was still tripping. I then took the gfi’s apart, and the breaker was still tripping. I followed an underground wire that was going to a garage outlet. I removed the wire that was coming from the outside and the breaker no longer tripped. I checked power at the other gfi and it was still getting no power. At this point I informed the customer that I have done everything I could do as a courtesy.  After the work was completed, he paid and then stormed off and slammed the door. "\n\nPatrick, We are sorry that you don\'t agree with our prices.  There are many factors that go into the price of providing service beyond the cost of the part.  We pride ourselves on being transparent and providing the price in advance of any work, and we do not ever do any work without customer approval.\n\nJamie Dent\nOwner, Point Loma Electric and Plumbing'}<//response>< GmapID>

Charlie Holt and David from Point Loma Electric did 6 hours of electrical work at our home.  Their work was done efficiently, and they left all areas clean.  They were very focused on the job, and I had to remind them that it was time for a lunch break!  This company is now our go to.  I have already referred them to my son and brother-in-law.</review>

<text>Such a disappointment.  I was charged $880.00 for a circuit upgrade and found out that the kitchen circuit which was the problem was not fixed.  What was fixed was the upstairs bathroom circuit.  I feel totally ripped off.  I am being told that all that was on the repair was the one circuit.  I know nothing about electrical circuits but $880.00 and not fixing what I thought was being repaired is absurd.  Two thumbs down and feeling totally ripped off.  BTW I am a Senior Citizen with no knowledge of electrical mambo-jumbo.  Shame on Point Loma Electrical. 👎👎<//text>< Pics>

<response>{'time': 1536306369438, 'text': 'You had us out for service on July 23rd.  You told our technician that you were having problems with using the outlets in your upstairs BATHROOM.  You were offered the suggested repair of a circuit restoration which includes replacing all of the outlets, switches and the breaker on one circuit.  You agreed to the repair which was completed.  Over a month later you called stating that “the circuit we worked on was still having the same problem” so we made an appointment to return.  You were upset because your schedule is so busy that you could only have a Saturday appointment or after 5:30 when you get home from work.  When we came back out on Saturday you complained that your coffee maker was tripping your GFI when used at the same time as other appliances.  We have notes and photographs showing that the only circuit we worked on in your home when we were there in July was your UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.  We never touched your kitchen nor is there any mention of it during the original service call.  As a courtesy we replaced a GFCI outlet in your kitchen at NO CHARGE on Saturday.  The technician repeatedly explained that the bathroom and kitchen are completely unrelated and that your kitchen circuit is overloaded.   The only solution is to add an additional circuit or plug your coffee maker into a different circuit.   He explained this to you several times.\n\nYou called again on Tuesday stating that the “work we did on Saturday” (for free) had not resolved the issue with your coffee maker.  I spoke to you and again explained that the kitchen which is downstairs and the bathroom which is upstairs are on different circuits and are unrelated.  You agreed that you did originally have an issue with the bathroom and had told our technician that you couldn’t use your hair dryer in your bathroom.  You admitted to me that you no longer have that problem since the work was done.  Now a month later you are claiming that your original call was actually for your kitchen, not the bathroom and you didn’t realize that the work we did in your upstairs bathroom circuit was not going to fix a problem in your kitchen.   You stated to me that since you had spent $880 for an electrical repair you felt that should have resolved all the electrical issues in your house.  I am sorry that you thought that a repair to your bathroom circuit should also fix an issue in your kitchen.  We would never say something like that and you hired us for an unrelated problem.  I offered to send you a partial refund as a customer satisfaction courtesy.\n\nJamie Dent, Owner\nPoint Loma Electric and Plumbing'}< /response><gmap_id>0x80deaaeace53f4f5:0xe64fbf825b30e8fa</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

I had been calling and leaving my number with another electrician I was referred to when we purchased our lights.  But after two weeks, I called MY electric company!  They responded immediately, scheduled me within the week, and came on time to install the pendant lamps expertly!  Once here there were efficient, respectful of my property, friendly, and finished earlier than expected.
I appreciate it, thank you so much!< /review>

The receptionists, Karen and Anna were friendly and set up our appointment, (adjusting it when my schedule changed), and, as they said they would, they called when the technicians were on their way.  Taylor and Trent performed the initial inspection, had suggestions, and also gave us a fair bid to upgrade needed items and additional work we wanted performed.  Very polite and knowledgeable guys.  We accepted the bid and are looking forward to having the work done by Taylor and Trent and their company.<//Review></record>

We had to replace an electrical panel in our house.  Ramon did an excellent job.  He is very detailed and thorough.  While the cost for job might be a little high, the quality of work and the warranty are worth the peace of mind.  Also, later that night we had issues with power not being on upstairs, related to the main electrical panel.  We called Ramon at 8pm and he came right over to fix the problem.  By 9pm our power was back on.  This type of customer service and response time is commendable.<//Text>

If you are looking for an electrician in the San Diego area, look no further!

I called Pt. Loma Electric based on a recommendation from another electrician.  They were able to send a technician to the house in less than 48 hours.  Jon, their technician, was courteous, knowledgeable, and gave me the confidence that he knew exactly what he was talking about.  Once the estimate was completed and the price agreed upon, Jon and his assistant were back out to the house in about a week.  Although there was a fair amount of work to be completed, Jon completed all required work quickly and efficiently.  His team also worked extremely neatly and ensured their work areas were clean and in great shape before they departed.  Most importantly, all issues noted in a previous inspection were corrected to code.

I have no reservations about recommending Pt. Loma Electric to anyone!< /Text>

<review>Contracted Point Loma Electric to upgrade the home  electrical system to 200 amp service, install new lighting in hallways, a whole house cooling fan, replace exhaust fans in bathrooms, add external lighting and run new wiring to some kitchen appliances to get them on separate circuits.  Jim and Dave  arrived right on time and came well prepared as they had all the materials needed for the work when they arrived.  They were efficient and precise in the way they did the installations, no short cuts, everything done to code, no exceptions on even the smallest details.  They also thoroughly cleaned up all of the dust and residue of the construction.  By far the best contractors I have ever hired to work on my property.< /review></record></dataset><record>

<text>We had a serious leak in kitchen faucet. Robert did a great job. Found the problem and did a quick temporary fix.  Let us know that we'd need to replace the kitchen sink faucet, gave suggestions and where to get it.  Gave us an estimate to install and his card to call to arrange.  Very pleased.  Will call Pt.

<date>1494432827511< /date><Rate>5< /Rate><text>I must admit, I have been hesitate to use Point Loma Electric because the prices I have been quoted have been higher than most. However, the reviews have always been stellar. So, when I needed some work done I decided to try them out.

Point Loma Electric sent Greg to our house. He is a very professional and nice guy. Not to mention extremely helpful. Greg installed 2 power outlets for me outside. I am not an electrician, but they are working. They also look professionally installed, which is something I have found is not always the case.

Overall, I have no regrets using Point Loma Electric. The prices are a little high, but the quality of work definitely justifies the cost.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1495040179355, 'text': 'Thank you very much!

I reached out to Point Loma Electric and Plumbing to help with me a clogged shower drain. The receptionist called me back almost immediately. The appointment-making process was easy it seemed like they were pretty flexible in terms of available times.

The plumber arrived when he said he would, was extremely professional, and got the job done well. The pricing was transparent (though not necessarily the cheapest) and it was easy to pay by credit card.

Overall, I would highly recommend Point Loma for your electric and plumbing needs in greater San Diego.< /review>

Had a great experience with Pt Loma Electric and Plumbing.  Had already gotten estimates for installing a 40-gallon water heater and still needed a couple questions answered. Robert Ibarra, a technician was sent and after talking with him, he installed the heater the same day.  An excellent installation  and every question answered in a professional manner!  Highly recommend both Robert Ibarra and Pt Loma Electric and Plumbing. Outstanding results!  Thanks.< /Review>

We greatly appreciate the excellent service of the electrician Mr. Mike Brito. He has so much experience that he fixed the problems very promptly that we had in our dining room, our kitchen and our two bathrooms. He's definitely one of the most experienced electricians that we've ever met. He was also very courteous and kind to explain to us in order to save our money. Thank you, Mr. Mike Brito!<//Text>

After being 100% satisfied with having Point Loma Electric upgrade our electrical service from 100 amps to 200 amps in order to provide power to new workshop several months ago, we just had them install a Whole House Cooling system (large, and very quite cooling fan and a separate Attic Gable Fan),  We couldn't be happier with the results ....our house is much cooler during the day and night, and we have full control over the whole system, as well as being very energy efficient.  Ramon and the office staff have been great to work with, just as they were during the first project.  I heartily recommend Point Loma Electric</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>We had Point Loma Electric out to do various projects in our older home - from adding/moving outlets and switches to installing wiring for exterior lighting... and my favorite... the Quiet Cool Fan! It's a whole house fan, which are typically very loud, but this one is just a quiet hum. It's amazing, and has dramatically cut our need for the A/C. The savings on that over the coming months and years will more than pay for all the work!

Their staff was nice, professional, clean... everything you'd hope for when having work done in your home. I highly recommend them.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

They kept me posted on the drivers arrival time and even let me know when they stopped for gas and when they arrived they we clean cut and very courteous. They checked everything from the main outside panels to the main inside breakers and even check the solar breaker panel to insure correct connections. They then checked all the outlets and switches. When they were completed they gave me a copy of things that they felt like needed further attention and an estimate on those issues. I would highly recommend this company to anyone. Thanks for your assistance.</Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Had a driveway surface drain clogged with years of dirt. Technician (Roberto) came out within an hour, had it flowing in under two and charged a reasonable price. When he saw an opportunity to upsell me on a much more expensive high pressure flush, he let me know about a simple DIY solution to save me the money. Would definitely call again.

<gmapID>0x80deaaeace53f4f5:0xe64fbf825b30e8fa</gmapID><text>I gave 3/5 because of the appointment process. I work full time and they don’t have appointments available outside of regular business hours. They gave me a 2-hour window and then they called at the end of that window, saying that they’ll dispatch a tech and would show up 30-40 minutes. They didn’t come for almost an hour. It was just frustrating that I spent half the day waiting, just for a quote.

But once Greg and Mike showed up, they were great! Really sweet, considerate, and professional. They did a thorough inspection for my quote, and also included some suggested updates for some old equipment that could be faulty and save me some major headaches in the near future. I really appreciated their openness and suggestions.

Although I haven’t had any work done by Point Loma Electric, the techs had me convinced of the job I want done.<//text>< Date>

Needed a second opinion on plumbing work needed that a different company kept quoting me.  Something felt off about the recommendation.  Got a hold of Scott with PL Electric and he came out, same day, to take a look for that second opinion.  Not only did Scott (and trainee) fix the issue that kept reoccurring, they did it for FAR LESS then the other guys!  AND! Scott walked me through everything, step by step, as well as giving some recommendations to help ensure the issue never comes up again (Which I have already done and, what do you know, issue hasn't come back!).  Scott understood the time crunch my wife and I were in, since at the time my wife was days away from labor with our first child.  Scott and I chatted quite a bit, all the while he was walking me through everything he did.  To top everything, EVERYTHING, off, as a courtesy and congrats on the baby PL Electric did all of the work free of charge!  The owner, Jaime (sp?) gave me a call to let me know of the professional courtesy, which brought my wife to tears in gratitude!
Don't go anywhere else, don't bother with any other plumbers (Trust me, had we gone with PL in the first place, we could've saved around $400 in needless "repair" work).  Just call Point Loma Electric and Plumbing!  Thank you so much again Scott and Jaime!  Our new little girl Emily thanks you too :)< /Review>

Orlando and Kurt were the electricians onsite. As promised they arrived on time. These guys were really good. Superb expertise, well mannered hardworking and easy to work with. They are quick but accurate. Very thorough and they don't leave any mess behind. On one of the tasks, an unforeseen set back was encountered when rerouting some cables throughout the attic of my house. Orlando as supervisor onsite briefed me on the slight setback and his recommended solution for my approval. I approved the go ahead and the task was completed without further problems. All work accomplished fully met my expectations. I've hired Point Loma Electric on three separate occasions since 2014 whenever I needed major electrical work done around the house.  Each time they have met the challenge.  Well done, keep up the excellent work. Highly recommended.</text>

It's always a good thing to hire someone who knows what he is doing.
Charlie phoned to let me know when he would arrive.  He was able to
solve my electrical problems and get my lights and outlets working again.
He is knowledgeable, competent and neat.  I really appreciated his advice
and know-how.  I recommend him highly and would call him again if I had
any other problems.  Thanks Charlie!</Review>

From the woman who answered the phone to the electrician who came out, this was a very good experience. We were able to get someone very quickly and when Greg arrived he was polite and professional. He walked around with me and I showed him the things that I needed to have done. He gave me the estimate and when I told him I would have to only do part of the list due to cost, he was not impatient in the least. He did the work and did a wonderful job and said he would be happy to come back any time we were ready to finish the list. He even made a few suggestions for electrical things in our older home. All around a great experience and I would definitely use them again.<//review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>Jim and his crew rewired our entire 1930s house and did an excellent job. They took great care in dealing with the old house. They also stand behind their work 100%. Since the house was mostly rewired in 2011, we had a couple of minor issues. They responded to those issues quickly and resolved them to our satisfaction.
We did some more remodeling after the initial rewiring and had Point Loma Electric come out and do that work as well. We can now say that the entire house was rewired by Point Loma Electric.

Overall, we are very pleased with the work they did for us and would not hesitate to use them again if needed.< /review>< pictures>

2 things are great about this company, their end products and customer service. Even though we ran into some hiccups, they tried their best to accommodate me and make me happy. I would definitely use them again, and recommend this company to friends and families.<//Text>

<review>We had Point Loma Electric come out to our home to upgrade our electrical outlets, which appears not to have been updated since the house was built in 1951. Trent came out and within 2 hours, Trent and his assistant replaced 16 outlets. Point Loma Electric was very reasonable with their prices, their professionalism, and their consideration of our pets. Will definately use again when I have to eventually upgrade our wiring.< /review>< pictures>

I am very impressed with Point Loma Electric. Mike, the
good-natured genleman who replaced our 20 circuit sub-panel,  was knowledgable, efficient and resourceful, and when the job was finished the area was cleaner than when he started. It seemed  to me that the other employees that I dealt with all were all cheerful and helpful. To me, that's a sign of a well-run business that I'm happy to recommend and to use again.</Text>

I recently purchased a condo and had electrical repair work that was recommended in the inspection report. I contacted several companies and just based on the phone conversation (receptionist was very pleasant, and knowledgable) I had decided go with Point Loma Electric. Repairman arrived right on time.  He had a little trouble understanding the recommendations in report, but did provide me an estimate based on the report.  He said he did not necessary agree with them all and said he wanted to run it past a senior electrician.  I loved it, someone willing to get a second opinion and not just charge me for things that did not even need to be fixed.  Just have to say the overall experience with company has been very positive and I am very comfortable that all the electrical work was done correctly at the right price.  If I ever need an electrician again, I will be going back to Point Loma electric.<//Text>

Greg and Trent showed up on time to give me a bid on changing out fluorescent bulbs for LED's. The gave me alternate options for the job which was very helpful. They came back to complete the job and removed the ballasts, rewired and installed new bulbs in a very short time. They took all the old bulbs and ballasts for recycling and cleaned up all their wires, etc. I would recommend them to anyone.</Text>

He arrived on time, in a professional uniform with identification badge, in a company marked van that had clearly displayed  California C-10 contractors licence on the side, as well as company information such as name and telephone number.

Mr. Holt introduced himself, and promptly put on booties to cover his shoes before entering my house.  My initial impression, as a former tradesman with almost 10 years experience, is that Point Loma Electric (whom I hired from the internet based solely on positive reviews) is a legitimate company that cares about their appearance, customer service, quality and reputation.

Mr. Holt's knowledge was exemplary and his willingness to admit that part of my planned project was cost prohibitive was refreshing to hear from a company.  Although the bid was high, it did include the cost-prohibitive work and additions that may be best suited by another class of contractors.  Mr. Holt did also forewarn me that the bid would be high due to the nature of the scope of work, which included many retrofit cable runs and dedicated circuits, with my desire to minimize drywall damage.

I respect Mr. Holt's forwardness and candor about the work I wanted done and the constraints of the job, as well as the potential for drywall damage.  I also appreciate that during the appraisal he took pictures of every aspect of the proposal, which aided him in providing a full, comprehensive bid before he left the premises.

Overall, Charlie Holt is very professional and I would recommend others to take bids from Point Loma Electric.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Just had one of their electricians in our home to fix the fact that there is no power in our small downstairs bathroom.  They told me that they would not charge me to send someone out to my home.  What they forgot to tell me is that they charge you a flat rate of $295 to analyze the possible problem and since we have an "not normal" electrical panel, it would cause me even more to fix it.  Showed the electrician the door before he could do a "diagnostic".< /Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< resp>
{'time': 1537901205910, 'text': 'Ms. Holmes, I checked with the electrician as well as his supervisor.  Our normal diagnostic / troubleshooting charge which also includes a repair is $295.  You requested that we change out your GFI receptacle without diagnosing the reason it was not working.  We offered to change out the GFI and do a minor diagnostic for $149 since you were very concerned about cost. This is a very competitive rate for an electrician to take care of a minor issue.  He also explained that if it was not just a bad device we would need to troubleshoot to determine the cause of the power loss.  When he went to change out the GFI, the electrician determined that there was no power coming TO the outlet, therefore changing the outlet was definitely not going to resolve your issue.  He also observed that you have a Federal Pacific electrical panel.  This obsolete brand of panel has many problems, lost the UL listing many years ago and is actually considered hazardous.  Your outage could be due to a number of different reasons including a problem in the wiring behind the wall, in another outlet, a breaker or the panel itself. When he discovered that there was no power coming to the outlet and knowing you have a Federal Pacific panel, he informed you that troubleshooting would be necessary to determine the cause of the power loss.  If the problem was in your Federal Pacific panel then it is possible that it would have been more, or maybe not.  It is our policy to inform the customer of both the best and words case scenarios.  Our policy is to let our customers know in advance if there is a possibility of something costing more rather than have an unpleasant surprise after the fact.\n\nJamie Dent, Owner Point Loma Electric and Plumbing'}< /resp>

I had a great experience with Ramone and Trent. The kitchen lights and various electrical outlets in my living room were not working. They quickly identified that it was a breaker problem and they were able to fix it. Ramone did a whole home inspection, explained things very well to me and made recommendations to update my 1956 home's electrical system and make it safer. I will definitely call Point Loma Electric when I decide to do the upgrades.<//Text>

Greg was our point person in replacing the entire electrical system in our home. The power had gotten to the point where it would go off and on about 3 times/day. He came out, quickly diagnosed the problem and spent the next two days replacing fuse boxes and every outlet in our home. He made the logistics of this so easy (as a person who works from home for the most part). He was trustworthy so I felt comfortable coming and going and leaving my dog at the house and the best part was he labeled the new fuse box SO accurately. We know exactly which breaker is responsible for specific appliances and parts of the house now (something that would have been very useful for past surges). Highly recommend PL Electric & Greg!<//Text>

<Text>We recently contacted Point Loma Electric, who has done electrical work for us in the past, for a problem where we needed to add and update old wiring in an old property.  They are unique in specializing in rewiring old properties, and they did not disappoint!  We were super impressed with how quickly they resolved the issue.   They were very professional and their workmenship was great.  Several unforeseen problems arose once they started the job.  They immediately let us know what needed to be done and gave us a professional written estimate and finished everything to our satisfaction.  I recommend them highly!!!  J.

From the beginning, Point Loma electric has been a wonderful company to deal with.

Greg Smink had a tough act to follow after Charlie, the first electrician was out.

They both were terrific and would be welcome back to any job that I have in the future.

Always professional and clean regarding their work and customers, I've felt they are top-notch quality.

With the degree of care that they gave me and my little unit (that had some difficult work performed) in La Jolla, I look forward to using this terrific company for the other properties that they can service.

Thank you, Point Loma Electric!

Ramon Padilla from Point Loma Electric did a very professional and thorough electrical safety inspection of my home recently.  He was very methodical and detailed in his inspection of all my outlets, lighting and circuit breaker panels, as he tested for shorts and loose connections.  He also took the time to explain in plain language the recommendations he would be making to both remedy problems and upgrade my electrical system.  Further, he discussed with me the need to modify my placement of smoke detectors and and the need to periodically test / replace them.
Ramon was very polite as he effectively summarized again his recommendations at the conclusion of the inspection.  He further explained the cost of the various options to address the discrepancies.
Ramon Padilla did an excellent job representing the professionals at Point Loma Electric!</text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>Chris came punctually,  diagnosed and fixed the nonfunctioning outlet and I was pleased with it all. The outage had been caused when a live (plugged in) wire came in contact with the outlet and shorted it out. Neither of us wondered how the live wire came to be there in the first place and off he went. The lamp which had been plugged in to the outlet did not work even when the outlet was fixed, but I assumed it was just a matter of plugging the lamp in and I said I would plug it in later. After he was gone I discovered that the lamp cord had SOMEHOW gotten cut in half and now I had a lamp cord to be spliced together and no electrician to do it. And no working lamp. Thanks to a friend who came over and spliced together the cord, the lamp is now working again. I now think he should have investigated it further and made sure the lamp was working before he left.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

This was the first time I hired Point Loma Electric to come problem solve and run some new wires and  circuits at my house. They did arrive within the two hour window as they said they would, actually only 15-20 minutes into that time window .
They came prepared to do the job. The electrician  David M, has 15+ years with the company . David is an excellent electrician , I showed him the problem and he gave me choices as to how the problem could be solved .
We came to an agreement and he quickly went to work . Very clever man  for having never been to my residence quickly figured out the circuits in the sub panel and knew what needed to be done to solve the problem.
I am sure older houses like mine built in the early 1940's can be a challenge, no fun crawling under the house in the dirt or going into the attic where the temperature was probably 100+.  I am very careful who I hire to come over to work at my house. Point Loma Electric has been around for about 30 years . Their electrician was very professional , the quality of work was to code and outstanding but more important , "I WOULD NOT HESITATE  TO HIRE THEM AGAIN OR TO REFER THEM TO NEIGHBORS OR FRIENDS".  If you do not understand electric and do not know how to do professional electrical repairs yourself , I think it is important to hire electricians  from a company you can trust. I found Point Loma Electric and Plumbing to be that type of company.

I called to request an estimate for a whole house rewire.  After giving all my information I was informed there is a $59 travel fee to receive the estimate. The company is in Point Loma and I am in North Park.. a 15 minute drive.  Needless to say I was disappointed, all other companies i've contacted so far do free estimates.. especially for a large rewire job.  Declined to have them come.  I guess someone else will be receiving my business!</text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Professional, Hard Working, Polite, Amazing.  My wife and I can’t say enough great things about Point Loma Electric.  From the time we talked to PLE’s dispatcher Erica, to the time Charlie and his team (David & Trent) left our house, we were in awe of their hard work and professionalism.  On day one Charlie arrived on time, and did a complete diagnostic of our house (including attic, under the house, and almost every plug and switch) explaining in detail every problem that we should fix.  He never pressured us into anything, and we felt comfortable proceeding with each new step.  Charlie worked for eight hours the first day, restoring power to our home after a cut-rate hack charged us $1300 for doing pretty much nothing.  The second day PLE’s team worked equally hard changing out old knob and tube wiring, installing can lights, new electrical outlets and switches, as well as making sure our electrical panel was safely wired.  I could write pages on all the great work they did.  Be advised, their quotes and prices are a bit higher than the competition, but in a world where a lot of people are just trying to make a quick dollar and don’t care about the customer, Point Loma Electric is worth every penny!!!< /text></record>

<review>In the past, great customer service..but making an appointment on line does no good! They called to confirm, they let a message, when I got home at 5:20 and returned their call, answering service answered and I told them I was confirming my appointment for Monday morning. They said they would relay the message. No one came on Monday, when I called they said they didn't have me down on their schedule because they personally hadn't confirmed with me and the online appointment was just a temp appointment! So now I have to wait a week before someone can come out. What is the purpose of online booking and having an answering service? !! HOWEVER CUSTOMER SERVICE JUST CALLED AND IS TAKING CARE OF IT..THANKS..AGAIN GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE...<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

We strive to provide the highest level of service to our customers as well as a great place to work for our employees, which means we will not be the cheapest electricians.  There is a saying in our industry that the most expensive jobs are the ones that have to be done twice and almost 40% of the work we do is re-doing work done by others.  We do charge a nominal fee to send our licensed electricians out which is applied to any work done.  It takes time and resources to send our electricians out to a home and they can only go to a few appointments each day.  The $29 dispatch fee we charge does not even begin to cover the expenses incurred to send our electricians out in fully stocked trucks.

But as always, Point Loma Electric sent help, in this case in O-T.
They are the only Electrician we have ever called since moving here 3-years ago.
They installed 240 for our electric car charger, changed our lites to LED's and put in new fans.... and so much more.
They are the best.

<Review>I had to replaced my standard outlets in the garage and bathroom with GFCi. Charlie came and explained to me how GFCi would not be the best option for my washer since it goes through different cycles that uses different levels of electricity which can cause the GFCi to trip. The same recommendation was suggested for my deep freezer as well, which made a lot of sense. I would not want to come home to a stinky deep freezer because of a power trip. Charlie not only came and replaced the necessary outlets but was very insightful to share his knowledge. Instead of changing out four outlets, I only needed to change two, which saved me the extra money! I would highly recommend Point Loma Electric.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>This is not Fred Di Carlo, but rather his tenant in the Blix St house. I am the one you set times up with and that is here when any work is being done. That said, I will write your review.
Your Point Loma representatives are always terrific- very friendly, polite, responsible, efficient. They always display a great sense of work ethic and pride in what they are doing. Over all, they reflect very well for Point Loma Electric! You are our go to when we need electrical services. I know Mr
DiCarlo fells the same way, and refers you whenever he can!

{'time': 1478115464887, 'text': "We are sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with our services because you don't agree with our prices. I see in our system that our electrician quoted you 2 different options, one of which was $136 to install an outlet.  That is a pretty average price for a licensed electrical contractor.  I also see that the electrician made a note in our system that you seemed annoyed by our pricing.  Due to that observation we reached out and called you back within 5 minutes of his leaving to let you know we were refunding the $29 trip charge,so the visit cost you $0.\n\nWe are not a start up, handyman service or a one man shop.  We have a legal employees with rent, payroll, workman's compensation, insurance and many other business expenses that a new or one man shop probably does not pay.  All of our employees are background checked, drug tested and go through a lot of training.  We know that we are not a match for clients who make their decisions strictly based on price.  There will always be someone cheaper.  Almost 50% % of our business comes from repeat customer and a significant portion of our new clients call us after having work done that now needs to be re-done.   We have been in business for 28 years and our clients can feel safe with the knowledge that we will still be around if they need us in the future.\nThank you,\n\nJamie Dent, Co-Owner, Point Loma Electric"}<//Response>

<text>To Jamie Dent on behalf of
Point Loma Electric

I was referred to Point Loma Electric by my landscaper Frankie Sandoval, due to some flicking lights concerns.  He informed me that Point Loma Electric specializes in wiring safety and modernization of older homes.

From my initial contact with Point Loma Electric I was impressed.  The Customer Care Liaison, Ms. Kirra LeBron demonstrated exceptional professionalism while answering my many questions, resolving discrepancies and ensuring me that the best possible job would be performed at a paramount value.

From there, the Point Loma Electricians Ramone and Charlie dispatched to my house for the initial inspection.  In their efforts to provide the highest level of service, they were accommodating and diligent during the inspection; once completed they sat me down and covered every concern I had and those they discovered.  Admittedly, I was overwhelmed by the critical hazards they uncovered and by the quoted estimate.

With heavy heart, the deal was made.  However, it was soon lifted.  From start to finish both technicians were courteous, proficient and considerate of my trepidation, assuring me my needs would be meet.  The final outcome was above and beyond my expectations.  I was not prepared for this level of quality, workmanship, and attention to detail.  Once completed, they not only guaranteed the electrical safety of my house but transformed the lighting in my home to directly manifest the essence of me.   Thank you!

The Dent family name and Point Loma Electric company has unmatched business and quality integrity.  Not only have you gained a customer for life, I will refer everyone in know that is in need of quality electrical work to Point Loma Electric.  You made my family’s safety and security your priority and I cannot thank you enough!

Sincerely,

<Review>I bought a fan with an up-light and installed it myself.  The light didn’t work.  I called the manufacturer and spent a half hour on the phone with their tech support; they were unable to figure out why the light wouldn’t work.  Then I called an electrician who spent one and a half hours, running back and forth to his truck, climbing up and down his ladder and testing circuits.  He finally gave up.  Then I heard a commercial for Point Loma Electric on Mike Slater’s Talk Show.  They guarantee their work, so I figured I had nothing to lose.  Jim Dent showed up.  I watched thinking I’d learn something.  He removed the switch plate removed two wire nuts, touched two wires together, found the problem and corrected it.  It took less than 2 minutes.  Here’s what I learned.  If you have an electrical problem, call Point Loma Electric…They know what they’re doing and will fix it in no time…the first time.

<Resp>{'time': 1531159881320, 'text': 'Mr. Clifton,  your appointment was scheduled for arrival between 8-10.  We did indeed speak to you this  morning.  The first time was at approximately 9:42 am when you called us to confirm that you were still on the schedule.  We let you know that the technician was on another call but that you were next to be dispatched.  We let you know that we were running behind but would do our best to arrive as close to 10 as we could.  Everything seemed fine with you at that point.  As soon as the technician completed his other call we called you right away to let you know he was on the way and would arrive in about 10 minutes.  The time was 10:03.  At that point you told us that you had already left, that your time is valuable and that we were wasting it and hung up.  We sincerely apologize that we were running late, however we certainly were not no call, no show.  The tehcnician was on his way to your home and we did speak to you.  We record all incoming and outgoing calls and have recordings of the calls and time stamps of each call and I confirmed this personally before responding to your review.\n\nUnfortunately in the service business, we are never able to quote exact times due to the nature of our work.  Sometimes calls go very quickly and other times the technicians can end up there for many hours.  We have been experiencing an unusually high volume of emergency calls.   We do our best to route our technicians according to the nature of the call as well as the location and customers desired times.   We were going to your house to provide an estimate and the technician was sent to an emergency call which was on the way to your house first.  We were running somewhat behind and we did let you know that.\n\nWe understand and respect that your time is valuable.  Unfortunately in the service world sometimes emergency calls have to take priority and that can cause us to run behind.  Our technician would have arrived at your house by 10:15 but you had already left.  We are sorry for any inconvenience.\n\nJamie Dent\nOwner\nPoint Loma Electric and Plumbing'}</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80deaaeace53f4f5:0xe64fbf825b30e8fa< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

{'time': 1506185153961, 'text': 'How interesting and disturbing.  Any survey of our reviews will show that our employees have a reputation for the utmost professionalism.  We take great pride and care in how we treat others and have a very diverse group of employees and staff.  They all treat each other and our clients with kindness respect and professionalism.  There is no one by this name anywhere in our data base, however the name is remarkably similar to an employee of a local competitor who has their own employees leaving fake positive reviews on their google reviews site.  You will not find a more polite and professional group of people than our staff, and I am sure that people can read through a fake review.  Unfortunately it does affect our star rating and that is clearly the reason this review was left.\n\nEDIT!  This reviewer has deleted their comment which called our employees nazi’s and racists.  It was an outrageous, hateful and nasty comment about our staff.  GOOGLE staff, if you can see the deleted comment, you will see why I flagged it as hate and inappropriate content.  Thank you, Jamie Dent, co-owner Point Loma Electric'}</response>
