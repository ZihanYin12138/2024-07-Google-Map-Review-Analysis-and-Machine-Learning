I have been using Byrd Pest Control since I purchased my home last year - and I have left one or two reviews on how awesome they are but I thought I would share something my technician did today, that was very thoughtful. It happened to be trash day, and having a torn up trash can (thank you City of Newman), my trash can is knocked over every week. Rebecca went out of her way to place my trash can next to my fence instead of leaving it laying out on the street, which would have been an easy option for her. So, thank you Rebecca! It just goes to show that customer service goes above and beyond when you use Byrd Pest Control!!</Text>

My technician April was helpful. She explained what my issues might be and how I could resolve them. Thankfully, April solved all of them. I’ve been in personal contact with her to ensure that all of my issues were resolved. I appreciate that, rather than having to call a main office all the time. It’s nice to know that April knows my personal situation.

I’d recommend Byrd Pest Control. They’re polite and quick to reply, and they’ve always resolved my issues.<//Text>

I contacted Byrd to take care of some rodents I have living in my attic. JJ came to the rescue! He is very professional, straight forward and funny! He provided me with so many tips and solutions to avoid these little pests from getting back into my house. Great service! Thanks JJ!!<//Review>

Byrd has been providing residential services at my home in Patterson for about 1 year. They have been on time for the appointments and clearly communicate appoint times VIA text and email; they also provide a recap of service provided. I have no complaints about their pest control services. Unfortunately, an interaction over the phone with a Service Technician forced me to cancel service. Byrd did not seem concerned about losing a customer. Guess I am a drop in the bucket; this is why I gave a 3 star rating. I figured a smaller company would be more focused on retaining clients.< /Review>

She had jumped into her work vehicle to head to her next job and called you to give you a heads up as to when you would be expecting her. When she called, her phone was not connected to the bluetooth for the first few second when she was saying "Hello, this is April with Byrd Pest Control, I hope your day is going well! I am calling to let you know I am going to come out to your home to perform your service" But you only heard "I am here to perform your service," and you were like "do you talk to all of your customers this way?" and April was "yes" and then you told her that you wanted to cancel the service. April had no idea what was going on or why you were so frustrated. Again I am sorry that there was an issue with the bluetooth in her car.  I can assure you that you nor any of out clients are a drop in the bucket, and we care deeply about our clients, and that April really cared about her relationship with you. She was not intentionally trying to be rude, and I am so sorry that you took it that way. You can go through all of our reviews and see how well she really cares for her clients. I know April was shocked that you told her that she should not talk to clients the way that she did. It was a shock to her and and confused, so when you asked to cancel she politely said she would let the office know and got off the phone. I appreciate your feedback. I hope that you can see consider what happened on the other side of the phone, just like I can totally see what happened on your side and appreciate your frustration. And now we can take a step back and see what was really happening. Please do not hesitate to give us a call if you need any help in the future. April is an amazing person will all the goodwill and joy in the world! Have a great week :-)'}< /Resp>

It was quite an issue when we moved into our new home last year. Garrett has been to our house number of times and he always does a great job! We love that he and the other technicians even clean up the spider webs. They're always very polite. I've been recommending Byrd to friends and will continue to!<//review>< pictures>

Had a need to eliminate some Ants and Wasps in and around out house, so I went on Yelp to ask for quotes.  I asked Saturday, and received a couple of answers back slowly until Monday.  While I did not expect a response as quickly as I got, Byrd Pest Control was kind enough to reach out to me on a Sunday and ask if they could schedule something this week.  I stated that Wednesday worked, and the technician (owner) scheduled something for 8-10am.  He was here promptly at 8am, and we walked the perimeter of the property (residential house) and talked about my pest control needs.  We identified problem areas, and the technician sprayed for ants, as well as a perimeter to prevent future infestations.  Offered to check inside, but I had no need at the time.  Also as a bonus discussed Bi-Monthly services and one-time services.  I believe $40/month gets you 6 preventative treatments a year.  Overall: I would highly suggest this Pest control.  If I have need for future services, I will definitely consider them.  The owner stated that they have about 150 repeat / contract clients in our area, so he's familiar with pest control needs in this neighborhood.</Review>

<Text>Byrd Pest Control is my #1 referral to anyone asking for a local pest control service.
John Byrd answers contacts promptly, and answers all questions with compassion, integrity and professionalism.
I appreciate the organic solutions he offers, also.
He came out to my home and identified a bug that had swarmed my property. He was able to assure me that it is just a garden bug passing through. What a relief!
I appreciated that he took my concerns seriously, and that he diligently researched the situation until he had an answer and a recommendation for treatment.< /Text>< Pictures>

For years we had put up with roaches, spiders, and ants, always buying over-the-counter products that only lasted a few weeks at best so we finally decided to get a pest control company and do it right - we found out about Byrd Pest Management through a friends recommendation. It's been the best decision! John Byrd does quality work and you get great customer service which is hard to find these days. I have recommended Byrd's Pest Management to friends and family. Haven't seen any kind of bug for month's! If you're looking for a great, reliable pest company he's your guy!<//review>

Called Byrd Pest Control because of a recommendation from a friend that is a client.
Had no idea that my house would have any critters hiding in a brand new house.
There is construction going on all around my house, and I  was informed by Byrd, that these little creatures have to go somewhere.
Believe me, after they sprayed the inside and outside. this place looked like the walking dead for bugs.
They also informed me that after the second spraying, I would not see any living or dead critters anymore.  And they were right.
I'm glad I payed for a a year in advance.
Highly recommend Byrd Pest Control...

John never tried to sell me something I didn't need or push me in one direction or another, as some companies do.  He helped me solve the problem and was pleasant the entire time.  I will definitely use their services in the future when the need arises!  I would recommend this company!!</review><Rating>5</Rating>< Resp>

<Text>Today, a bat flew into our garage and created some panic in our home. We called Byrd Pest Control and just like that John quickly arrived at our home and terminated the problem! He was polite and professional! We highly recommend Byrd Pest Control if your family is in need!

<review>JJ is the best! I enjoy our visits every other month, I could stand and talk all day with him if we both weren't working:-) I appreciate he lets me know upon arrival, we review any issues I have and then he lets me know when he is done. He is aware I have dogs in the house, he is kind enough to remind me to wait till everything in the yard dries before I let the dogs out. I enjoy our Byrd Pest visits and appreciate the friendly service and no bugs!</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1557859231500, 'text': 'JJ is the Best!!!

<Text>JJ was wonderful. He was totally transparent with everything he did. Explaining along the way what he was doing and why. You should be proud to have such a wonderful personality as a face for your company. Glad I went with Byrd, if not to just me a nice guy like JJ. Will definatly be recommending your service.

I have used Byrd Pest for a while now. I know it is hard to keep the pest away when you live out in the country, however my technician JJ has tried his hardest to help keep the pest away and make himself available when a new pest arrives. Jj has always been courteous and available for any of my concerns. I would definitely recommend Byrd’s pest control and make sure you ask for Jj as your device technician.</Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>This is my first experience with pest control.  I heard about John Byrd (owner of Byrd pest management) from a friend. Since we had just moved into a house that had ants, spiders and TONS of snails I decided it was time to take the plunge.  I am very picky when I am paying for a service, but John exceeded all of my expectations.  John was on time and professional. He was friendly but I didn't feel like I had to supervise him (if I have to watch someone do their job then what is the point).  He showed great attention to detail, even taking the time to knock down the cobwebs hidden on parts of the fence. Since the date of service; aside from two individual ants that I saw on two separate occasions I have not seen any ants, spiders or snails.  John has checked in with me since the date of service and I am convinced that he is concerned about my long term satisfaction. You will not be disappointed.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>{'time': 1557859518992, 'text': 'Thank you Travis for your feedback :-) And taking the time to let everyone know about your experience!

<review>I LOVE John Byrd and Byrd Pest Management! He has really wowed me with his enthusiasm and how he has grown his business.  He is a serious businessman and wants nothing less than your 100% satisfaction. He handles tough pest problems!! And we had TOUGH pest problems; wasps and a serious country rodent problem. And now we are at peace with no more pests :) Hire Byrd Pest Management. You won't be sorry!<//review>< Pics>

I have been using Byrd Pest Management from the day they started up as a business here in Patterson, they have been above excellent.  They will work their best to rid you home of pests, it does not matter it its snails, roaches, pincher bugs they will get them!!  John the owner/operator will personally come to your home/business to take care of the problem, guaranteed!  Byrd's pest management also has two workers J.J. And Garrett both great employees who will go beyond their normal job description to help you out!!  I personally love this company and its workers.  It's nice to have a company who cares about your well being!  Give Byrd Pest Management a try, you have nothing to lose but the pests at you home / business that's a guarantee!
Thanks Guy's.  Michelle Saleen of Patterson, Ca.<//text>

< review>
We have been using Byrd Pest Management for over 2 years now. We started using them after I encountered a huge cockroach in our garage and I thought I might die. Luckily I came away from the incident unscathed. Byrd Pest Management came out and evaluated our property. They were very knowledgeable and went over everything with me. If I ever have a pest problem I can call them to come out and take care of it. And they are super affordable!"</review>

As a former pest management professional, I can say that Byrd Pest Management is one of the few companies that will only sell you what you need, with no games, based on up-to-date science and technology.

This company has real integrity.<//Review>

I was looking at our records and we do not have anyone by your name in our system so I was not able to find out any reason as to why we may have not gotten 5 stars from you. Would you mind letting us know what we might have been able to to earn two more stars? We take great pride in our work here and it drives us antsy (yes pun intended) when someone feels like they have not gotten anything more that a 5 star service from us.

Just a suggestion...  when you are cleaning the woman’s restroom.  Instead of telling a customer that they are going to be closed for an hour, how about you have an alternative for us to us.  For example, other places have a shower reserved for use when bathrooms are down.  It’s really not that complicated.  It’s called quality customer service.< /Review>

Ok two showers is pilots fault not the employees. But employees have found a solution to the no automated check in and other drivers just waiting for u to open the door they just jump in. They take your phone number and call you. I honestly think corporate should fix their mess up. Add an additional 2 showers somewhere and automate it. There is a loves 8 miles away.< /Text>

<review>Today master diesel fuel pumps are running really slow, slave pumps are pretty good. The problem is with the leak sensors, which the management hopes to have remedied by tonight. This is written on 6/13/2019. Otherwise, this facility is rather new and is nice and clean. There is a PJFresh hot food service that I will try out this evening.</review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>{'time': 1560507152551, 'text': 'We are happy to hear you had a positive experience.

Good for cars. Truckers, roll on by.
Nice and clean. Staff was friendly. The Wendy's was good. The PJ Fresh looked a little not so fresh.
My main complaint aside from the small lot... Only 2 showers! Several hour wait at 4pm on a Sunday.
Oh, and heads up. The 4 for $4 at Wendy's is actually $4.79.
Update. Finally got my shower. It was lukewarm at best :(< /Text>

<Resp>None< /Resp><Review>Customer service at Wendy's (walk-in) & Pilot is awesome. Dunkin Donuts associate needs re-training on how to treat customers. As I walked by, I peeked at donuts on cart (didn't touch, that'd be in unsanitary ...) & associate says (as she's walking toward the donut islands/display), "excuse me please don't look at the donuts". I lol & look at her to see if she is joking with someone she knows... nobody was there
lmbo
she was telling me not to look at the donuts on the cart! How ridiculous is that?
So remember, when you go to Pilot & the Dunkin Donuts associate leaves the cart unattended, don't look at the donuts!! 🤣🤣🤣</Review>< time>

<review>I think they built this to keep Glamis people out. The gas pumps are tight. Getting a motorhome with a trailer to them would be extreamly difficult if not impossible. I wouldn't try it. The back diesel pumps will not let you use your card. You have to go inside.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response><Gmap_id>0x80d75bc90d90b8dd:0x2c39162a0b9a419</Gmap_id></record>

<time>1546203763832</time><text>Was very disappointed in the layout of the pumps. This pilot is right by Glamis Sand Dunes but is not set up for RVs and trucks towing trailers. There is only one entrance in and out which made it extremely difficult for those vehicles towing. We had to block an entire lane just to get gas then it took us 10 minutes to maneuver our RV and trailer to get out. DO NOT GO THERE WITH AN RV OR TRUCK/TRAILER for regular gas.</text><Rating>1<//Rating><gmap_id>0x80d75bc90d90b8dd:0x2c39162a0b9a419< /gmap_id><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< userid>

Friendly owners, great selection for a small grocery shop. The store face isn't on Magnolia; it's behind Joe's Sushi. Been going here for years now.<//text>

<Review>You can get all your basic korean groceries here. From rice cakes to red pepper paste. The staff were friendly and helpful when I asked on how to cook a certain dish. Don't expect to find beauty products here except for the occasional face mask.< /Review>< Pictures>

Everything you need in a small shop! Anything from ramen to fresh vegetables, a varowty of rice to frozen snacks(ttokboki, melona pops, frozen readyade soups). They even have fresh homemade kimchi made right in the store. Not just kimchi, but they also have a variety of freshly made side dishes.< /review>

Very nice little store with everything you need for Asian cooking. Fresh vegetables, fresh noodles, frozen meat and seafood, nice selection of ramen, candy, crackers, oils, sauces, flours and rices. Nice people working there seem happy to help if you have any questions.</Review>

This is a wonderful market specializing in Korean delicacies. I visited with the hopes that I would find everything to make a Korean BBQ style meal at home. I was not disappointed. In addition to a plethora of interesting imported items, I found thin sliced brisket, marinated spicy pork, and thin sliced pork belly. All of the meats look like great quality. They also carried several varieties of delicious kimchee and pickled radish. We even found our favorite Korean snack, banana puff chips. This is the best asian market that I've found in the Riverside area. I will definitely be back.</Review>

<Review>Prices are fair and affordable. The selection is adequate but not amazing. The produce quality is decent although variety is low. The meat selection is expensive but excellent. There are several ingredients I can only get here. EXCELLENT quality kimchi and pickled veg.<//Review><Response>None< /Response>< Pics>

Definitely a hidden diamond. Authentic Korean foods without having to go to LA. It's not a huge store but it packed with everything to homemade kimchi, different varieties of homemade banchans, soups,  dumplings, meat, seafood, spices, sauces and so much more. You can find things that can be instantly made or to use to make your favorite Korean food. Absolutely love it here!</text>

The prices are excellent, basically no different from the giant H-Marts in Orange County. The selection is well thought out. They know what all the best stuff is. I ask them for Korean food prep advice, and it works.

This is a lovely store run by a family who wants to bring accessible Korean groceries to the IE, a place they love and call home. They are living a good life and running an old-school family business. I like this place.

EDIT: This is the only meat I want to eat. Super clean and high quality cuts. Way cheaper than going to KBBQ. And you can drink at home, safe from the police.

EDIT: They make and sell their own kimchi recipe, and it's the best kimchi I have had in my life.</Review>

Great little market, big variety of food; snacks, refrigerated & frozen food, a meat counter in the back, and fresh produce. Entrance is a little tricky because you don't reach it from Magnolia, but from the side facing Arlington park. Only thing I didn't like was the $10 minimum purchase to use your card.</Review>

<Text>My SO and I finished a bike ride and were craving Mexican. We got a handful of items: super quesadilla with carne, it was alright. Carne Asada fries were okay, a little soggy after the ride home. Their green salsa is awesome but their red tastes like tomatoe sauce. My SO got fish tacos and liked them.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP3r3nYBXbg8un92QPxKthYRzlnir-zRX1f5Fr5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhTwL9DjXpZNevfly80gjOfmtpqbwyKZxMbqWK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7R0KdllCzI49_H7ifZsYbkM7lBcRRFMzB0WmT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< Resp>

Placed an order for carryout and they tell me they dont make what I ordered when I arrive to pick it up. A courtesy call is simple and avoid low rating reviews like this one. I hope others don't experience this.< /Review>

<text>(Translated by Google) I tried some super roast beef nachos and they were very good. I definitely recommend them. It was the first time that I went to eat at this restaurant and I will definitely return some other day. The service was also very good and the waitress was very kind and not only with me but also with all the other customers.

Probé unos super nachos de carne asada y estaban muy buenos. Definitivamente los recomiendo. Fue primera vez que fui a comer en este restaurante y sin duda alguna regresare algún otro día. El servicio también fue muy bueno y la mesera fue muy amable y no sólo conmigo si no también con todos los demás clientes.</text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAzxaWGuJjA4iADqExsefZoksjMEV5U1DWbfHQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNyKupLf5ETox3g4SeYcsoIPSnTjziyMO4Znv8e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNdw9mr0PE213NRYRluwBfkLO2-ygrQPAlyvoS_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOtEGZGFACN5o-VKZAaC83Yu8Vt1k5x7JYsH-vr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x8084161a209cf245:0xeb7f2332f4552cdf< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Teriyaki chicken bowl was delicious. Menu has a great selection.   Plenty of parking. Service was excellent.  Very clean and organized.

Excellent teriyaki chicken perfectly grilled. I add the veggies also perfectly cooked and with rice. Fish (cod) is very good also. Chiles Jalapeños on the side are perfect. Stellar customer service every time I have visited.</Review>

<date>1600655258799< /date><Rate>5</Rate><text>For me, eateries are not a sliding scale comparable to another. My experience at this place is related only to itself. This visit was my first, and it will not be my last. I got a combination plate, with chicken and beef, which comes with rice and salad. The quantity was hefty, it's definitely two meals in one. The beef and chicken were equally delicious which pleased me. The rice was at maximum rice tastiness, in that it was white rice that was cooked well. The salad was bright and fresh and the only think I didn't like about it was the dressing. I felt a vinegar based clear dressing would have made more sense along with the entire meal. Fortunately, it was on the side so I could limit the amount. I checked in on Yelp to get free egg rolls, which I thought were very tasty, though we were not provided with a specific sauce to dip them in. My experience was overall positive, I think you should give this place a go if you're considering, I will be back to try other items on the menu.< /text><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoAfPBtTjSrKy2H0IIGA_qUmYv0MZu-3XTwe6e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1600729703290, 'text': "Glad to hear you have such a great first impression!

Good place to grad some food. I'd recommend calling in your order. There popular so expect to wait. If you don't call ahead of time. Good food.< /review>

Good food, reasonable prices, helpful staff. Standard pandemic practices including masks, social distancing, plexiglas at the counter between staff and patrons. It has very small waiting area so you wait outside for your food until your number is called (per sign during pandemic).< /text>

I always order for the beef and chicken teriyaki (half and half) that comes with fresh vegetable salad. The price is affordable and worth it considering the big servings they give. The place may not be that obvious from the main street Lakewood Blvd.). Nevertheless, it has a clean dining area.</Review>

Bowls are not good price for the small portions of food they give..Beef teriyaki in my opinion is so salty almost like tender beef Jerky  ..make sure to let them know how much teriyaki sauce you want especially if you don't like too much because my bowl was drenched OVERALL the chicken teriyaki was delicious and the rice was cooked 👍 great<//Review>

<text>This restaurant is not Covid Safe. whoever is at the register will ring up orders, handle money & cards, answer the phone, then go into the food prep area without washing their hands and prep orders. putting rice in the bowls, bagging orders, touching the containers and then the other food workers touch the same containers that the person that touched money from incoming customers. Hand washing should be taking place in every transfer from public handling to kitchen work. Not sanitizer - 20 seconds of hand washing. Don't eat here unless you want to take a Covid risk!</text>< pictures>

This place is really good. We were going around looking for a place to eat and we saw this hole in the wall. The workers that were there were really nice. The food came out at a reasonable time. Didnt have to wait to long. They also have burgers and chicken tenders here which was really good because we had kids with us and that's all they really eat so that was a plus.</Text>

Well done, extra toast, hot sauce etc. All of this at really low prices too! Definitely recommend this place.</Text>< Pictures>

Love this place been coming since they opened. The owner Alex is so friendly and remembers repeat customers. Well it could be due to eating here weekly at one point with my sis and kids 😂😂🤦 but even after not being able to come for awhile when I call in my order he already knows it's me and the order. The portions are large I split a large with my kids. The burgers and fries are bomb too.< /Text>

Egg rolls fresh, hot, a little greasy. Light grease. Had chicken and beef teriyaki bowl. Okay meat, teriyaki sauce somewhat bland. Had taste of shrimp, very nice. No real decor. Just a couple of tables and chairs and an order counter.< /text>

<text>I  ordered two chicken and beef bowls , the Chicken was burn and the beef was hard to eat , also the add to much rice and it was old  and the teriyaki sauce had too much salt on it 👎👎.
Iam very disappointed with the food if i could i wouldn't add one star on this post,  I wrote a post on Yelp but the app doesn't let me post a review on there because they pay to erase all bad reviews.
I always go to Golden Bowl on Alondra blvd , they have great food there 👍 , but I wanted to try a different place but unfortunately I made the wrong  decision of going to teriyaki house grill 👎👎.<//text>< resp>

<Text>I went yesterday afternoon ,  and the chicken taste undercooked , my stomached became to hurt really bad ,  it isn't the first time , it honestly seems to me that in the afternoon , their quality drops drastically,  I would say the best times to go would be before 2pm, also the lady cashier is always rude to me, she treats customers like they are stupid , I hate going in person cause 9 times out of 10 , she's there .

<Review>This is the place to go for your saltwater/reef livestock. If they do not have it, they will work to get it. In addition, they will order any gear you need.

I'm new to the saltwater hobby and was recommended to check this shop out by a friend of mine. I wasnt disappointed in the knowledge of the staff nor the shop itself. Will be going back. (Purchased the smaller ocellaris on the right)</Text>

I love this place. All your questions answered in honest layman's  terms a beginner can understand.
Coming to this store is like Coming home.
Everyone is so friendly and they even encourage you to call them later if you have something you forgot to ask. Best customer service ever! I'll keep Coming back.< /review>

My 3 year old granddaughter wanted to go to the zoo or aquarium but there just wasn't enough time in the day.  So I looked up aquarium supply stores and found this one!  She was delighted and we made about 15 trips around the store to look at everything.  I was impressed!  I saw things I've never seen at any other store.  All the corals, anemones, snails, shrimp, fish, sea stars ... Oh my what a selection! Thank you so much for letting us look!<//text>

<review>Chris and Meghan are just the nicest people. They are not out to sell you everything they can. They are very knowledgeable and extremely helpful for those new to the hobby. I’ve been to a few other places and this is my favorite place. Never made me feel dumb for all the bone head mistakes I made. I love this place and highly recommend it to anyone. I almost forgot to mention James who has been a walking book of knowledge. He has a way of explaining everything so that even I, a simple minded person can understand. He always lets me know he’s available to help and that I can call if I run into trouble. Very sweet and honest people, If not for these place I’d probably have given up by now.

Combines excellent prices with outstanding customer service in an industry where the opposite is so prevalent!  My absolute "go-to" shop for my coral reef needs.</text>

Meghan is always such a huge help and extremely knowledgeable. She offers great advice, she's relatable in her experiences with building tanks, and very easy to talk to. We plan on returning again and again :)<//Text>

<text>Have been in the hobby many many years, and the service here is above and beyond. I have small kids and most places ignore customers like myself due to the loud children. This place gave them stickers and were as friendly as I could ask for. Kind and friendly. Customer till the end!!</text></record></dataset><record>

Kids had fun playing. We had a large group and got a discount of $17 per person. More easy to swallow that price vs their standard $25. Expect long lines and medicore slopes for tubing. Trust me, your teenage kids won't enjoy this place and you will leave with a sour taste in your mouth.</text>

<text>The Trout Creek Rec center is a fantastic spot after a day out on the slopes. It offers hot tubs, a heated lap pool, large heated recreation pool, steam rooms, a full gym and much more. The staff are always super friendly and helpful and we look forward to visiting when in the area.  Great spot for the kiddos as well!< /text></record>

If you are a dues paying member, this place is great. It has a few pools and 2 spas (I think). It has a pretty nice work out room and a driving range as well.<//Review>

<review>I really enjoy the outdoor swimming year-round. The pool is usually between 78 and 82 degrees sometimes it feels like it's going to be cold when you're going to get in but it's usually just right no matter what the weather. I really enjoy the hot tubs there are three 2 outside by the lap pool 1 over by the steam room and sauna. My wife really enjoys running on the treadmill and using some of the equipment in the gym. I know some of the staff they're super nice I've heard the swim lessons are amazing in the summer. Not too many places I'd rather be on a hot summer day than outside on the pool deck enjoying a nice lunch. I believe if you want to drive golf balls you need to get your tokens inside Trout creek. They have a lot of parking if you have like a giant car you could totally park it in their parking lot. The snow play center in the winter is pretty sweet it's it's on the driving range there's also Summer Concert Series right there which is really really fun and everybody should try and get tickets and go. Tahoe Donner is awesome.</review>< user_name>

I've been to Trout Creek Rec Center many times while renting summer houses in Tahoe Donner. It's a giant disappointment & really misses the potential it could have to be the only resort / rec center in the North Tahoe area. Here are the reasons why: the price is astronomical & sets the guest up to expect great things when paying the (reduced) rate of $15 per person (kids over age 6 have to pay the adult rate). Then, Trout Creek fails to meet even modest expectations. 1) staff ranges from unhelpful to rude. Need a towel? They're part of the price of admission, but they won't tell you that. They are kept behind the counter at the front desk. 2) As of 2019, the place is under massive construction & half of it is closed. They do not tell you this when taking your payment. What's worse? The construction is happening while the place is open. Buzz saws, hard hat areas, and literally a guy painting the ceiling as we walked under it! 3) The new sauna room smells like MRSA lying in wait 4) The pool itself is "kind of" clean in certain areas. In one large corner, pollen and dead bugs gather and it has always been this way. 5) Exercise classes are subpar; don't waste your money. I saw an instructor  doing leg lifts on all fours with a sway back. 6) The pool is cold all summer long.  One good thing about the facility is when Marco Polo Grill is open -- they offer poolside food service. It's fun and pretty tasty. However, they keep limited hours and don't open until late June.< /Text>

<text>Riding a tube down a big track was fun, but not worth the cost and the long lines for me. The next day we went to Donner Memorial State Park with our own sleds and had a much better time.

If you don't have your own sleds this is a good choice...but if you do I'd go elsewhere.<//text>< GmapID>

I paid $44!!! yes $44 to play with a 2 year old and a 6 year old in the snow. Of course you can't bring your own sled either - capitalism at its best...
Where are we going as a society where a movie trip for two adults and two children costs you $100 and where playing in the snow on a little hill cost you $44 - and that was just one adult and two little kids. NEVER again!!!

Driving up from Sacramento made this a $100 weekend just to play in the snow.<//review>

Prices have gone up in 2016-2017 winter, and it getting pricey. $25 for Public Adult and $14 for Public Child. Sleds and tubes are provided bc no outside equipment is allowed. With the same price, Donner Ski Ranch ($25 per 2hrs of snow tubing) is better with carpet.

There is No carpet to go back up, so you can't play long. The sled slope is very short.

Outdoor restroom. Cold while waiting. Public is not allowed to access the club indoor restroom.

Snow play without soft snow is boring because snowman can't be built from ICE.< /review>

Way over priced for what they offer.  The tubing was super short and safety seemed to be over fun.  They asked for my 3 year old to walk back up the hill rather than being pulled in the tube.  $25 per adult for 2 short tube rides and 1 super short sled hills. WAY over priced.< /review>

I originally rated this 5* but just came back a year later and had to fix my rating. I found that the prices for guests had been raised 50%. The hot tub was not hot, only half the jets in the lukewarm tub were working, the towels must have shrunk in the wash because they are half the size they used to be, and the waiting benches all had their cushions removed so you can't sit in them, no paper towels in women's restroom etc. I gave feedback when giving back the keys and was told the cushions got wet and were never replaced (at a water facility) and the fees went up in January so we should've been paying them since then, instead of a simple apology for the poor experience. We used to come at least 1x a week as guests from our seasonal rental and now are considering changing rental location because of the poor service we received while here. Super disappointed.< /review>

And no reduction in price when they only have one tube run open (the only interesting thing there even for a 3 year old).

<text>Food was great. Good Covid precautions. Unfortunately the drinks were rather watered down. Our party had several of the signature drinks (which are supposedly doubles) and they were very weak.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Whoa, I did not expect this place to be this cute. The outdoor area is massive and open, and we felt pretty safe with their COVID precautions (they take your temperature and you have to sign a contract tracing form). The food was pretty solid - the potato salad is freaking mind-blowing if you're into dill. Not pictured but equally as tasty was the caprese toast</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOnpCn7Ax1314SQPsiPytj38nBiorJzAEpu03WH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMfEyp--HowMOGE8FNpAixqxenmpa50TcIHDdxX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2bb4a7bbfa437:0x7bc029d842fc7d02<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Great place for outdoor patio dinning. They even provide blankets but for a chilly night go prepared as they don’t have enough heaters. Staff is friendly. Food is not that great.<//Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Such a great place. Staff is super friendly and the outdoor patio has a great vibe. Glad to see this business has adapted and continues to provide a safe place for people to gather.

<Review>The only nice thing about this place was our server. Our table ordered food and it never came. Turns out the kitchen was out of what they ordered and never said anything. I ordered an Irish coffee because it was a cold night and waited forever, only to have them say they can't make any hot drinks at the moment. I then get a double cocktail and that took forever to come out. It didn't even have any alcohol in it! I'm pretty understanding of different situations but this was ridiculous. Our our server was doing the best she could. This was clearly management that was the problem.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response><Gmap_id>0x80c2bb4a7bbfa437:0x7bc029d842fc7d02<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Sorry Not Sorry is a playful rosé-wine and cocktail-forward beer garden and restaurant. They serve fresh takes on garden party menu classics and alcoholic beverages to-go. They have a 4000 square foot open air back patio that provides a "safer outside" space for you to enjoy perfect L.A. weather. All tables are 6 feet apart. All servers on site are wearing masks, face shields, and gloves. They also have a 17 point covid safety plan in place as well as a sanitizer station.

I have to say, this is the first place that I feel very comfortable eating at without a worry. They’re very well organized and everyone here practices social distancing and obey covid requirements.Knowing all that gave me a peace of mind while eating here.

Their cocktail and food menu is amazing! We wolfed down everything we ordered- house made sliced roast beef, chef’s daily vegan salad, turmeric garlic fries, and the summer watermelon salad! And the tasty poisons were so yummy!! The frosé, the golden pineapple, and Carrie & Mr. Big... all of it pretty solid. Kudos to the bartender and the chef!< /Text>< Rate>

Got seated almost immediately then waited about 30 minutes to get an order until after the (what I assume was the manager) asked us if we’ve been helped yet  (even after waiters were up and down the patio checking all tables). After taking our orders, our drinks got there about 10-15 minutes after, which is fine, but upon the time of ordering, we were told most of the main courses were out(we were fine with that) we just had a simple order of fries and fried cauliflower (which we were told were both quick wait time). We ended up waiting an hour and 15 minutes until we decided to cancel our order and leave. Other people came in WAY after us and got the exact same orders we did and received their food and drinks almost immediately after.< /text>

<response>{'time': 1598819120340, 'text': 'Hello Lara,\nI’m sorry to hear that you had a bad experience here at Sorry Not Sorry.  Based on the timing of your review and my memory, I know that you were here on the our very first busy weekend.  We had just grand opened 2 weekends prior, and we had very low customer volume.  We staffed lightly the day you came in, thinking it would be slow, and then we got slammed!  Which is great for us, but bad for customer service.\n\nWhen things were slow, servers were taking every other table so that their incomes would be equal.  However, as things got busier, this became really inefficient.  A server’s tables could be all over the place and tables get “lost” when no one knows to pick them up.  That’s what happened to your table – your table got “lost”.\n\nI wanted to let you know that we’ve made several changes since that weekend.  We now have proper server sections for greater efficiency and to prevent tables from getting lost.  The hostess now seats guests in alternating server stations to give the servers enough time to provide proper service.  We even changed our drink and food ticketing system to accommodate or new restaurant style service.  We used to operate only as a bar before COVID-19, so it’s been a real learning curve for us.\n\nWe hope you come back and have a great experience!  I would like to offer you and one guest a “welcome back offer” of 1 Main Dish (per person), 1 Side Dish (per person), and 1 Cocktail (Per person) – all complimentary.\n\nIf there are any issues, you can reach us directly at info@sorrynotsorryla.com\n\nThank you!\nKim'}<//response></record>

Great place for getting together in our pandemic era. The amazing Kim Vu, founder and co-owner, has created a perfect yet safe environment to meet eat & drink! How? By outfitting its former parking lot with themed umbrellas, tables, etc., all spacious and well-distanced.  Since summer's end Kim has enhanced the ambience with heaters, additional decor, and large screen TV (nicely placed so it doesn't intrude conversation).  Easy to get to, easy street parking. Check hours due to Los Angeles pandemic limitations on outdoor dining.  Five extra stars if I could give them  for surviving the pandemic assault on restaurants.</Review>

<Text>This place is quite nice, but the sommelier and business owner Kim Vu has not communicated with me about our agreement since November 16th, 2020.

I cohosted an event with her in late October in partnership with my business, Women of So Cal.

It started out as a co-hosted event where I would invite women to the event and host a panel. Then eventually, the event was collaboratively reduced to my business receiving a "marketing fee" of $10 for each woman that paid a ticket.

I have yet to receive a check and have reached several times via email and also called Kim - with no response.

I am patient and understanding and I get that it’s been a tough year with C*VID - especially during the holidays. Nevertheless, I have a business and livelihood to maintain as well.

I am reaching out on principle. It's not just about the money, but about the lack of communication. My friends purchased food and we were given half-off gift certificates and all planned to return.

After this experience, I would caution any new business looking to partner to reconsider and/or stay strong in your convictions.

I am hoping everything is well and have reached out to get a response to no avail. This is my last resort and I am looking forward to a response from the business owner.

Truly hoping all is well and looking forward to the next step.</Text>< userid>

Gratuity is included even if it's 1 person dining and they won't bother telling you and receipt isn't itemized. Don't get hoodwinked. Shady business practice.</Text>

Sorry Not Sorry is the 2nd place we have tried during covid-19 and I have to tell you we have been impressed by the safety precautions they have taken. Firstly, you have to sanitize your hands at the entrance. They take your temperature when you enter and also log your email to inform you incase someone is tested positive for covid. No-touch menu and very professional and friendly service staff also made us feel very comfortable here.

Big bonus for LA: They have a patio that they turned into a beer garden which is pretty refreshing!<//text>< pics>

<text>The staff at All Paws is friendly and professional. We have brought in 4 cats to be see and every time was pleasant. The office is clean and doesn't smell like some other vets and was comfortable, before COVID. The doctors seemed willing to explain anything wrong with the animals and did not seem to rush anything. You need an appointment to get in and sometimes it can take a bit to get an appointment.<//text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

I called at 3:50 PM to make an appointment before they close at 4pm Some girl answered and said can I put you on hold I said that’s fine  I waited for 10 minutes and then at 4 o’clock I heard the phone pick up and then hang up I called again and they were closed. It’s kinda  unprofessional<//Text>

First time here. Everyone was great! We got in on time. No excessive waiting. The doctor explained everything and answered all my questions. They didn't try to talk me into tests I didn't need or overcharge me. There is plenty of parking right out front and it's conveniently located.<//text>

<Text>My dog has been seen at this Vet, they have good service.
BUT!
If you go to a specialist or ER and you want to bring the RX medication script to this office to get the medication THEY WILL NOT FILL IT!!!
We all know specialist and ER charge more for medications.
So your/this primary vet for your animal, will not help you?</Text>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1575941523940, 'text': "This is simply untrue. We will, and do, provide prescription medications for our patients who have a current exam. Unfortunately Ms. Komaromy, we have not seen your pet since August 2018 and we have never prescribed the controlled substance that you had requested. Although veterinary hospitals often have an in-house pharmacy, we are not considered a pharmacy such as CVS, Costco, Walmart, etc. Therefore, we are legally only permitted to prescribe to those patients that have a current patient/doctor relationship. If you do not want to purchase the medication from the veterinary hospital that treated your pet, we suggest filling the medication at a local pharmacy or keeping your pet's exam current so that your regular veterinarian is able to do so."}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

But I paid 300$ for stitches on my dog only to have her foot completely healed less than a week after. I mean. 3 days in one of the wounds was closed despite her losing a stitch that wasnt even double knotted. 300$ for a wound a bandaid could have fixed!
This place is simply money hungry. I am very upset.< /review>< Pics>

< review>
My husky Kenna, my husband and myself have recently become acquainted with All Paws.  She decided to invest she sort material that she shouldn't have starting a week long "is she sick or worse" ordeal.  By the 4th day she was not improving and I took her in and was trying not to fall apart as she is my first pet and my baby.  The staff was so welcoming and knowledgeable.  She did end up needing surgery, but we started out diagnostically.  And they made me feel comfortable the whole way with something that I felt like was the scariest thing I had gone through in my whole life.  If you are looking for a veterinarian I highly recommend this animal hospital.<//review>

<Response>{'time': 1555375428519, 'text': "We would like to remind everyone how important it is to spay and neuter your pet at an early age. If you are going to breed them, please see a veterinarian prior to doing so and have regular checkups throughout their pregnancy, not only if/when things don't go as you had hoped. It is also very important to not self-treat or medicate your pet, pregnant or not, at home with medications that were intended for human consumption. When calling a veterinary hospital, especially one you have never visited, it is very helpful to the doctor and his/her team that you give all necessary information and ask questions at the time of scheduling the appointment. [ie: my dog is pregnant, do you have an ultrasound machine?] This allows us to schedule accordingly or possibly refer you to an emergency facility."}<//Response>< Name>

< Review>
I brought  my full-term pregnant dog suffering in pain with a purulent, bloody , malodorous, discharge to Alfredo Madriaga. He suspected pyometra, an emergency that requires antibiotics and usually emergency surgery. He told me he did not have time in his schedle to do surgery. The x-ray showed two full-term puppies. All paws didn't have an ultrasound on site to completely diagnose pyometra. Even though this was an emergency situation, the vet wanted me to make an appointment for an ultrasound at a different location the following day. I brought my dog to All Paws Animal Hospital because I expected them to handle an emergency situation. Dr. Madriaga refused to treat my dog because she was pregnant even though pyometra is an emergency situation. He should have explained that he could not diagnose and treat this condition and I would go elsewhere. He charged me $39 for an exam and a whopping $175 for an x-ray. I had to take my dog to another vet whom did emergency surgery and said my dog was so sick, she was near the point of no return. All paws and Alfredo Madriaga took advantage of my situation. He knew he could neither diagnose or treat pyometra but failed to tell me right off. He wasted $214 of my money and delayed the treatment of my dog. He told me to bring my dog back in 2 or 3 days if she hadn't delivered her puppies. She would be dead if I listened to him. Unfortunately she lost her puppies but at least her life was saved. If your dog is sick or pregnant,  I recomment taking her to a different vet.< /Review>

The office staff and vet seem to really care about animals. The vet takes a lot of time with the animal and then with the owner explaining everything to them about their pet. I was happy with my cat's visit. I will be taking my cat back here because of this.< /Text>

<Review>We spent almost $500 at this vet and they were unable to give us anything but the receipt that day of the visit. They claim they are unable to give any record of snap testing results, despite every other vet doing so without problem...it's not that big of a deal to do so...and they are unable to send us an email of records for snap test results or bloodwork after 5 days already. Rude vet tech who was overly dramatic because the first vet tech or receptionist placed the carriers on the examination table. I told I did not do it, but she was still upset. Short on staff so they only have one vet tech able to work with the pet at a time, unlike the other vets we have gone to over the years. This is a small practice and you get the small service. However, if a client pays almost $500 for services, you should get the paperwork as that is part of the service. This is a mickey mouse clinic that we will not be returning to in the future.</Review><userid>113909100334166757036<//userid></record></dataset><record>

<Time>1531840288339</Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>The very very kind women whom I spoke with helped me out so much! I almost made the horrible decision on getting my precious cats declawed, because a previous vet said “it’s normal to get all four paws removed”. She was extremely honest and told me how the procedure was done. Truly opened my eyes. Yes my kitties might scratch me or my furniture, but definitely not worth it to put them through such pain and torture. She recommended and alternative called “soft paws”. I’m extremely thankful I spoke with such a kind women. I told my husband and he immediately changed his mind on the whole declawing idea aswell and bought soft paws right away. I wish I remembered her name because she definitely deserves some well earned attention. If it helps she’s working today I just got off the phone about 10 minutes ago. Thankyou again the customer service world truly needs more people like you!</review>< pics>

This Starbucks is very busy but they keep the line moving! Service is fast, staff don’t have time to talk...haha! But they have everything you need from coffee, to Latte, to pastries and more! They have quite a collection of merchandise so if you collect Starbucks items you can pick them up here if you’re in the area!!!</Text>

<Text>The staff and management all were super awesome and accommodating. Moving from the east coast to the west, I found the Starbucks recipes different. However, this establishment worked hard to get me the taste I'm use to. I appreciate them so much. Feeling like home a little everyday.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80853e586622bb81:0x4cbf573b8fb04237<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<date>1536953254267< /date><rating>2</rating><review>Okay... I dont know if it's the barista but this place is bad when going for vanilla bean cremes... I ask for extra caramel and I get a cup that barely has any. I also asked no whip and so she puts whip but when I addressed it she scrapped it off and put a lid on it, not even thinking about replacing the caramel that was on the whip... My wife's vanilla bean creme had been made to look like one but not taste like one... Hers was practically ice and could taste no creme what so ever... Never again we will be coming here.</review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMf7bZIh2Ys8Y61O2t7-Q7eIhQBdZo6uYVM9IIX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80853e586622bb81:0x4cbf573b8fb04237</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

The people are very kind, but don’t know how to properly make my favorite Starbucks drink. It turns out tasting wrong nearly every time and I just choke it down anyways because there’s always a lot of people in line.< /Text>

<review>I love the staff here. They make it a point to get to know you and your family. If your order isn't right, they'll remake it until it is. They truly care about you. you're not "just another customer".<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Standard Starbucks--good but not great. Somewhat limited selection of food compared to other Sbux. As an observation applicable to all Sbux, the star system continues to be tweaked so that one spends more and received less.<//review><GmapID>0x80853e586622bb81:0x4cbf573b8fb04237< /GmapID>< rate>

<Review>I"ve been to a lot of Starbucks, but this is the worse service I've seen.   I tried to order 3 Pike coffee.  I was told they were out of Pike, but had Blonde and Dark Roast.  I told them I'd take 3 Blonde.  I was delivered 3 coffees, and 1 was stone cold.  I asked him what was up and he said he was out.   Here are my issues.  1st  if you know you are out, why arn't you brewing more?  2 Why would anyone serve cold coffee?  He could of said we are all out.  3  No creamer was out, and no sugar was out.  Yes, it's a very busy place, but is that an excuse?  I will never go there again!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

<username>Tag Along Tagalog</username><Review>Kinda of the Baristas fault: I order two drinks and they didnt announce who the drinks were for so some kid walked away with my drinks. I told the barista and she said she will re make it but after she finished with the que thus pushing my drinks back! Take the customers names and announce it as soon as the drinks come out like all the other Starbucks.</Review>< gmap_id>

Called Rooter Hero and they had a technician at our house within an hour.  Jarid was awesome and very professional.  He was thorough with the job and explained everything he was doing.  Most importantly, he fixed the issue and cleared the clog going out to our sewer.  Fast & efficient service and overall, an excellent experience from Jarid Ross and Rooter Hero.  You’ve earned my business.  Thank you!!< /text>

Do not use them!! Try a different place with quality employees!!

I usually don't leave reviews on companies I haven't used yet. However, it doesn't seem like I will be using rooter hero. The reasoning: one of their drivers going 85+ on 80 heading to Reno tried to run me into the center divider. I have clear dash cam footage. The driver continued to cross traffic lanes like he owned the road. Hire quality people next time. I will continue to leave reviews on google and other sites.< /text>

<Review>They were able to find the city clean out in my backyard and diagnose the problem. It was a city pipe and they said the city will repair it for free so I only had to pay a nominal fee for them to come out. The city said that was really good of them because other plumbers would try to fix it themselves and stick you with the bill. Honest, timely, and reliable service. Chris and Gary were great.<//Review>< pictures>

Although we were not able to locate the leak, he did point me to the next step directions.

Mike was on time and very informative all the way through the process. He does what he says he is going to do and he does it all the way to completion. Rooter Hero Plumbing has been good to me and my family. They may be more expensive than other plumbing companies out there but in my opinion, you get what you pay for. Just because a company can quote u the lowest price doesn’t mean they are going to do the best quality job. I believe with Rooter Hero Plumbing I’m guaranteed to get the most professional and best quality service and in my opinion, that is what is most important. I absolutely will be referring  Rooter Hero Plumbing for all of my future Pluming needs. A special thank you to Mike for all of your hard work and Rooter Hero Plumbing for being an honest hard working local business we definitely need more businesses that have the same qualities as u do. Hope this review helps someone out there feel comfortable and confident with choosing Rooter Hero Plumbing for any of their plumbing needs.</review>

My wife and I can't thank Mike Caspillo enough for all his hard, professional work in fixing our shower in the master bedroom.  It was a long, tough project and Mike really went the extra mile for us.  We can't thank and recommend him enough!!  He's obviously an incredibly valued member of the ROOTER HERO team!< /review>

Jeremy Schooley did a wonderful job. I had an issue with the toilet and tub, called for a same day appointment and they were able to send out Jeremy. He was professional, on time, paying was not a problem and the issue was fixed within an hour, maybe less. I definitely recommend Rooter Hero Plumbing! Five stars for me.</review>

< review>
I called 5:30pm 5/9 and was give a 7-9 time slot. 8:40pm I hadn't heard anything, so I called to check in. Turns out they didn't have a tech to send out to me. The person I spoke to said he couldn't help me since he wasn't overseeing my service area. Said he would let the dispatcher covering my area to call me since no one had reached out. 9:02pm still have not heard from anyone. Called back in, there was a changing of shift for the dispatchers so they forgot about me. They told me they still didn't have a tech for me and would reach out once they did. Jump to the next day Monday 5/10 I get a call asking if I still needed a plumber. 9:00am soneone finally showed up to help. The tech was super friendly and helpful, I would recommend him as a individual but definitely wouldn't never recommend this company. There is no follow through, and the customer service is not the best.</review>

<Text>Rooter Hero was very understanding of my problem and I felt that they appreciated the urgency and anxiety I was feeling over having so many drains clogged in my home. However they did not honor their coupon pricing for any drain unclogged for $77. Cost me $315. Said the coupon was for a one time service. I don’t believe they ever unclogged a drain for me prior although they had video inspected my sewer line maybe 7-8 years ago. Anyway just be aware and ask before they come out. I was in no position to say no !!!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

They repaired / replaced about 90% of the sewer and the water lines in an older home where the pipes were 72 years old.

They worked with me on pricing and the icing on the cake is after they were done and I paid them, Antonio went one step further and repaired a small problem with the one sink that was not park of the initial repair.

ALL of the staff were professional and knowledgeable.   I am SO impressed

They will get all of my future plumbing business for sure.

<Review>Troy, Nathan, Jacob and the rest of the crew were outstanding and very hard-working! We had a clogged drain that ended up being a collapsed sewer pipe that needed replacing. The diagnostic person showed me the pipe using a camera and it was clear that the pipe needed replacement. I was offered three repair options and did not feel pressured to make a choice. There was no hard sell, which I appreciate.
Although my partner felt the repair price was high, I understand the difficulty of estimating a job like this since it is hard to predict what issues might come up underground - the job can go smoothly or be really challenging so it’s a bit of a gamble for both parties. Rooter Hero gives a fixed rate estimate for the job and does not add on extra fees as they go. This means the job price might be on the high end of the market, but it also avoids add in fees that can result in much high fees than estimated. Other companies give a base estimate and add on as they go. Considering that plumbing jobs can go south quickly, an open ended estimate can add up!
The job was done promptly and quickly. The crew was polite and careful of the plants and trees near the job and they always let us know what was up. The office was short staffed during the job so the paperwork follow up seemed slow but that is understandable. When my partner called the office and complained about the slow paperwork and that she thought the price was high, management quickly responded to make sure her complaints were satisfied. They explained the pricing strategy and sent photos and paperwork immediately. Troy came out personally to follow up. Responding quickly to customer issues is key, and this local Rooter Hero did a great job of following up! I would recommend them to anyone.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Kyle came out from Rooter Hero due to my water heater not lighting. He came out quickly, fixed the problem, and when we asked gave us estimates for a new water heater (we asked for them, even though he was wonderfully honest and said ours looked fine.). I will be using this company again, and sharing their number to neighbors in need of their services. 👍</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1620660237615, 'text': 'Thank you Samantha for your honest review Glad that we able to provide you with good customer service looking forward to working with you in the future'}<//resp><GmapID>0x809adfc579fe8665:0x35d85eea3f944408<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I have spent a lot of money using other companies to clear the line. None of them had the professionalism to tell me that the clog is not on my property and is in the area that falls under the Counties responsibilitiy. Chris and Greg. It only identified this within 15 minutes, they also found the cities clean out trap that was buried in my yard and I was unaware of. They gave me the info of who to call and I have a County worker coming out now. These 2 gentleman went way out of their way to help me and here’s the kicker....they didn’t even charge since they didn’t try to unclog it. The information they gave me would have saved me at least $500 that the other companies charged me and never said it was the county that has to fix it. I will use no other company in the future but this one. And again Chris & Greg were just outstanding with their knowledge & professionalism. Thank you guys.</Text></record></dataset><record>

We had raw sewage coming up from our showers late Saturday afternoon and it was a nightmare! We called three places all together and the only place to help us was Rooter-Hero. The entire staff from beginning to end was fabulous. Adrian came out that evening and did what he could but realized he would have to return the next day. He arrived at the time he said he would along with his assistant Jose. They both followed Covid protocols and were fantastic. They didn't rush the job, which we greatly appreciated. They made sure to inform us of each of their steps along the way and told us exactly what they were doing. The two technicians were extremely respectful to one another and worked great together!</Text>

<Review>Mike was very professional and showed up within the designated time. Mike suggested a permanent fix and a temporary fix. Due to the time and cost we went with the temporary fix. Mike stayed until the problem was fixed. He ran the snake through twice to clear the stubborn clog. I would recommend Mike for any plumbing needs. The cost was half of what I paid 5 years prior for the same issue.<//Review>< gmapID>

<review>My 94 year-old mother lives in a 60+ year-old house in Carmichael.  At 4:00 p.m. on a Thursday, her caregiver called informing me all 3 toilettes in the house weren't flushing.  Within an hour of calling Rooter Hero, Greg was on the scene diagnosing the completely obstructed sewer line and getting a crew digging down through the night to reach the sewer line.  He also sent me a video of the sewer line and the plumbing under the house, which was leaking sewage. They quickly got the toilettes working  He then turned the project over to Trevor, which was a real blessing.   Trevor was fantastic to work with!  He was very responsive, available, & professional.  He kept me informed throughout the massive repair work and was also very kind to my mother.   I recommend Rooter Hero.  They have great, professional staff & were a pleasure to deal with throughout a very nasty incident.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>{'time': 1617666502956, 'text': 'Thank you Mark for the awesome review!!

<review>My grandpa had an angle stop go out on him. He called this company and they came out promptly. They then convinced him that he needs a complete repipe, two new toilets and a tankless water heater. He lives in a 1,000 square foot home and they charged him $29,000. Other companies quoted at around $10k - &15k for the same project. When they were here they punctured a water line and then never fixed it. Unacceptable that these people try to take advance of an elderly male. 100% do NOT recommend.<//review><Date>1616787011895< /Date>< Resp>

We were desperate to get our drain unclogged ASAP  and Rooter Hero Plumbing responded right away and had a technician at our house in an hour.  Great service from the minute we called them.  Caden our tech got our drain unclogged  and working perfectly within minutes.  He even gave us a drain tutorial which we greatly appreciated!  So impressed with the service and tech we signed up for the maintenance plan.  Won't call anyone but Rooter Hero Plumbing in the future.  Actually hoping my friends drains will clog so I can tell them about Rooter Hero!

NEW REVIEW: 4/72021

We called Rooter Hero again for a toilet that wouldn't stop running. .  Oliver completely replaced the inside of the toilet with better parts than the original. Rooter Hero was at our door in about two hours after calling them!  This company never disappoints. Techs are always polite and friendly.</text>

My whole house was backed up so I gave Rooter Hero a call because they have the best $77 dollar drain promo  and they are highly reviewed.(now I know why!!) Mike Caspillo was the technician that came to my rescue. Mike was very thorough and informative. Everything he did he included me and kept me updated. I am so impressed how much Mike actually cared about resolving my drain problem!!! He found sewage under my home so we had to replace a section of my mainline and I am so thankful we did because I no longer have to worry about not being able to use my shower or toilet!! Most  importantly I have myself plumber that genuinely cares about my family and our home. Thank you so much Mike and Rooter Hero!!!! You better believe I’m going to recommenced you to everyone I know!!</review>

Tyler and Louis did an awesome job with our sink repair. The job started as a single clog, and ended up with some major work needing to get done to all of our drainage lines. They were prepared for everything that this 1938 property could throw at them, and did it with a positive attitude. I would absolutely recommend this service.</text>

Oh my Michael Caspillo is an awesome very professional young man. He knew his stuff and got the job done efficiently. If you need any work done or evaluated Michael is the man to ask for he will take great care of you. I will most definitely be using him again in the future. Great guy< /Review>

Jeremy is great to work with.  Professional, friendly, knowledgeable and gets the job done.  We have done several jobs with Jeremy and the company that he works with.  We would be willing to have him work for us anytime.

Although good workmanship, the company is overpriced compared to others.

I do not have good things to say about his supervisor Greg.  He was rude, obnoxious and a liar (to both me and my wife and, on multiple occasions).  He has no customer service or people skills.  I've been told others feel the same way.  Go out of your way to work with anyone at the company except Greg.  If we are ever put into the position of having to work with Greg, we will go somewhere else and recommend that you do the same.

The administrative staff was wonderful on the phones, they were always friendly and, were excellent with follow up.

I was very impressed and pleased with the lead man on the job, Manuel.
Friendly, considerate and above all knew what he was doing and made sure all the workers completed their job to his standards.
I had whole house plumbing replaced and that included a bathroom remodel. they worked fast and efficiently, kept me informed every step of the way!
I appreciate that they cleaned as they went along.
Manuel went above and beyond to make sure things were done right. He and his workers showed up every day on time until the work was done!
It was quite a job but I feel like I have new family!
Thank you Manuel and all the folks who made my house livable and gorgeous!
:)
Getting plumbing pipes replaced is scary but they all put me at ease.
They came recommended and I’ve already recommended them to others as well! Great job!<//text>

<review>Called this morning,  gave me an appointment time between 1200hrs-1400hrs.  Gregory called at 1200 hrs to let me know he was on the way.  Very professional, explained everything in a clear and understandable way,  explaining what options and cost of each.  Thank you very much for the speedy and professional service.  Will definitely call with any other plumbing issues and would refer their service to a family/friend without hesitation.</review></record></dataset><record>

After having the wrong sized sink installed (the second wrong sized one), my dishwasher is crooked and sticks out at one end. A third employee of this company was sent out to see what could be done. Thanks to him, I now not only have a dishwasher that is crooked, I now have one that starts to tip over and fall out when the door is opened. It was not properly secured. I would be more than happy to discuss this with someone from Rooter Hero, except they won’t return my calls. Which I only started making after the guy was supposed to call me after his visit, and  didn’t.  Unless migraine headaches are your idea of a good time, stay as far away from this company as possible.< /text>

<Review>Anthony is the person from Rooter Hero that came to my house to clean up the draining system for my kitchen sink. He arrived about 5 minutes before our appointment time. Anthony is very professional on the work, he opened up the draining system and fixed the slow water run in my kitchen sink within about 45 minutes. I had another plumber to come in the day before, who tried around 3 hours and keep trying the next morning for another 2 hours while couldn't fix the problem and gave up. That's why I called Rooter Hero and got Anthony to come in on the same day. He did a great job to fix the draining system quickly, it cost me $150 includes a 30 day warranty, Anthony also cleaned up the working area in my kitchen carefully after the work is done. I am very happy with the work he did. Strongly recommend both Rooter Hero Plumbing and Anthony.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>James just came out nailed it. Called for next day out to the house within a hour they where here. Can't say enough good things. know we have roots but he got us through. Can't say thanks enough.

Note for covid above an beyond.

If you need sewer slash plumbing repairs this should be your first call. Done the others this is better.

Just saying don't take my word but I would.< /Text><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

I appreciated the call that he would be arriving in 20 minutes. He took the time to ask if there were any other issues that we might be experiencing. Technician was very knowledgeable and made us feel comfortable with the service preformed. We are very happy with the service and highly recommend Rooter Hero Plumbing.</text>

Greg, Nick, and company did an outstanding job. We’ve been having drainage problems for quite some time. These young men came out for A fair price and did some good old fashioned back breaking work.
Throughout the whole process we felt taken care of.We will be recommending Rooter Hero. Thank you.</Text>

Very simple.  These guys got the job done without charging extra unnecessary money. They came the same day, they honored  the $77 coupon for snaking  my sewer and the guy that came out was fast and friendly. What more could you want? I’ll definitely use them again if I have the need.

Used them again on 5-14-20. Replaced my kitchen faucet. Great job!!<//Text>

<Text>Words are not enough to describe how pleased I am with Rooter Hero Plumbing Sacramento, and the work they performed. Before contacting them, I had used another plumber who charged me about $700 to basically make a hole in a wall to access a pipe and then run a snake into it to temporary clear the pipes.  The problem returned a day later, but was worse.  After contacting several other plumbers to deal with the problem (some didn't return my call; some had phones that were disconnected; and others didn't have to proper equipment to handle the job), I finally got a hold of Rooter Hero and booked an appointment for the next day.  Much to my surprise, I received a phone call from the Operations Manager, Patrick, the following morning to assure me that he was sending over his best guy to troubleshoot the problem.  That guy turned out to be Greg, and Patrick was right about him.  After sending a camera into the pipes, we saw several failed sewer pipes leading from our house to the main sewer line.  No "snaking" was going to fix this problem. Greg immediately informed me as to what needed to be done and how. This it turns out was going to be a major project. After assuring me his company could handle this type of job, he wasted no time preparing and filing a work permit on his phone and scheduling a County Inspector to come out later that day.  Greg also sent out two guys, Antonio ("Tony") and Trever to dig the holes necessary to access the broken pipes.  These holes ended up going down about 15 feet.  Greg also determined a second hole could be dug outside my house to access the pipes connected to our downstairs bathroom toilet and shower instead of tearing up my bathroom and the adjacent laundry room and causing a major disruption to my family.  Throughout the entire project, which took a little less than two weeks, Greg, Tony and Trever worked diligently on completing the job with as little inconvenience to my family as possible.  They routinely worked long after dark, and on the weekends to finish the job as quickly as possible. They were all extremely courteous and professional and constantly kept me informed as to the status of the work. The work is now completed and we have complete use of our facilities again. The pipes are flowing like new!  I am absolutely convinced that had I not hired Rooter Hero or had Patrick, Greg, Tony and Trever not been involving throughout the repair, this situation would have been an absolute nightmare for me and my family.  I will be eternally grateful to all of them, and I will definitely use them again next I have any plumbing or other household problems!  Thank you! Thank you!  Thank you!</Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

After what I can imagine would be a grueling 18 hr shift working with sewage under a hot California summer sun, Anthony came to help me and my family and fixed our plumbing blockage as he had just returned home himself. My family, especially my 5 year old daughter sincerely appreciated his work and how he gave an informed experience and kept a smile on his face the entire time. A true value to his company and to our family. Thanks Anthony! -Sincerely, The Jones Family ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</review>

<review>Richard was awesome staying in contact with me when the new hot water heater solenoid malfunctioned.  I was able to keep my tenants updated during the two days of cold to warm water because of close contact from Richard.  I would have given 5 stars if the new hot water heater worked properly after the installation.< /review><Response>{'time': 1592581391978, 'text': 'Thank you very much for the kind review Dexter'}<//Response><Rating>4</Rating>< Name>

I highly recommend Rooter Hero plumbers. I called for a leak and they were so quick to respond and the tech showed up within an hour of my call. I had what I thought was a small leak, turned out to be a major pipe repair but they were able to give me a fair price and fixed it quickly! I would recommend rooter hero for your Plumbing needs!< /Text>

Manuel is an excellent plumber!! Knowledgeable, respectful, professional, punctual. He exchanged my water heater in record time and left the area he worked in spotless!! He is a gem and customers appreciate this kind of service.  I will definitely be recommending this company to my friends and, hopefully, they will be lucky enough to have Manuel come out to their homes!<//Review>

Called mid-morning; We didn't need emergency service, but they did say someone would be in contact within the hour. Didn't hear from them in 2 hrs, called again. This happened 4 times throughout the whole day. We were very frustrated that we couldn't know to run an errand, since we never found out when they would respond.
Plumber arrived just as we were preparing dinner. He was helpful and out in an hour.

<Text>Quick and professional! We had a kitchen sink back up. Nick came out and solved our problem for $77. Then took the time to explain why it happened. We will be recommending Rooter Hero to our friends and family.<//Text><date>1593529870180</date><user_id>106006624946989297613<//user_id>< name>

RE:  Service Date of March 3, 2020

I really appreciated services rendered by employees that assisted/provided help.  I was especially appreciative of Trevor who notified me when he would be arriving,  Once he arrived his professionalism showed in his knowledge and immediate fix of my plumbing issues which was frustrated and stressful to me at the time.  Trevor patiently answered all questions in which I had many and even proposed suggestions which would better aid me in the future.  I would recommend the service of your company for anyone I know who desires satisfactory results.  Trevor comes highly recommended and is a definite asset to your company.<//Review>

<review>The old water heater went out the day before our weekend party. Just my luck with this house. Nic and Caden came out, spent their time with me, and provided me their expertise. I decided to replace the water heater. It was done in under two hours and looks great. They hauled away the old heater and even cleaned up their mess. Job well done.< /review>< pictures>

The Technician was fast to respond, communicated with about what time he would arrive was professional in explaining what work needed to be done. The price was half of what other places I contacted and he did the house call late at night and didn't charge anything extra.

The Technician came out with a bunch of knowledge solve the problem within the hour ended up being a clogged mainline. The service is amazing and will definitely be using again. Highly recommend them especially if you need 24/7 service fast response time and even when it was late still had a good attitude and a willingness to work</Text>

I don’t write reviews very often but felt I needed to after the work that Greg with Rooter Hero did. Initially they had to reschedule,  but they were here the next morning right on time. Greg was very professional, knowledgeable and even gave me some advice about maintenance with plumbing and what lead to the problem I had. They had an advertised special that was less than half of what the other three plumbers quoted me.  I highly recommend Rooter Hero for good work at a very fair price. Thanks again Greg!< /review>

When I called at 10am T said was it today and reschedule for that evening 4-6 PM.  Some lady called from the their office and confirmed, plumber is on his way due to traffic he is running late. Around 5-30pm I received a call from Jessi that he just got a dispatch he will be at my home in 20min. After I told Jessi the whole schedule story he said he will contact his boss and asked me if I stil wants him to come and do the job. At that point I have no option but to let him do the job. Otherwise who knows when I will get appointment with another Plumber. Jessi came and did excellent job. He is good plumber but the Co. seems like over book the appointments or don't give a damn about customer. 5 stars for Jessi not the Company.</text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809adfc579fe8665:0x35d85eea3f944408<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I had a sewer back up at 7:30 pm. Tony arrived shortly after 8:15. The problem was identified quickly as an old cast iron clean out failure. All the mechanics of the issue and the options were explained. Modern plumbing was installed and you wouldn’t know anything ever happened under my yard.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1592581294077, 'text': 'Thanks so much Kathy for the review'}< /response><gmapID>0x809adfc579fe8665:0x35d85eea3f944408</gmapID></record>

<text>I called half a dozen places at 9:30pm, and Rooter Hero was the only company that could come that night. Troy called and said 15 minutes, and he was at my house on time. He was courteous, efficient, and really cared about getting us up and running .
I will be calling Rooter Hero from now on.< /text>< UserId.>

Rooter Hero did very good job in my house.

Seldom you find the best plumbing company out there but I got lucky today with Rooter Hero. Parish is the best plumber anybody can ask for. He is very professional, knowledgable and honest individual. All my questions were answered to my satisfaction. Clearing my clogged kitchen sink was done as expected and recommendations were shared without pressure to the client. I have requested another appointment for a pipe analysis since mine was built in the 50s. i need to get a free estimate on possible replacement. Highly recommended company and will likely do business again.</text>

I had out of town family members and our sewage system was backing up with sewage going into some of the showers.  I made a call to Rooter Hero.  That dispatcher had someone call me back shortly and they were at my house within the hour. They were so nice and helpful and got our plumbing unclogged.< /Review><rate>5<//rate>< Resp>

Rooter Hero came out to to fix a bubbling sound in the sink drain. They arrived on time and cared for me by wearing a mask. Nick spent time with me explaining why this problem occurred, fixed it, and gave advice on how to maintain my pipes. Thank you Rooter Hero.<//Text>

Plumber showed up got right to work found the plug and the type was very capable of getting it broke up  Very knowledgeable about the issue . good person easy to work with and he answered any of my question . Kept his work area clean and did a great follow through with showing me one last time with his camera that my drain was for sure clear . got his card and will use him again. The price was great too.< /text>

< review>
I have them scheduled yesterday, 3/10/20 within the window time 9-11am. Have to call them and check them around 9:20AM because nobody yet is calling me. I spoke with someone and told me I will be getting a call in 60-90 minutes. Time passed and it's now past 11am and never got a call from this company. They didn't respect my time. WE are all working, I only planned of taking a half day and ended up calling someone else to get the job done. Called B O N N E Y..... BONNEY.COM...CALL BONNEY! Bonney guy came as promised. I will never recommend Rooter Hero! I respect your reviews, but this is based on my bad experience with Rooter Hero.<//review>

<Text>Greg was such a true hero!  He saw me trying to snake my main sewage line outside of my house, and pulled over to help!

If he didn’t stop, I’m not sure we could have cleared the blockage.
He was so helpful to show us the problem, and suggest a few fixes. I will forever be grateful for his help, and will be a loyal customer!
Thank you so much again!< /Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Was contacted less than 5 mins after making an inquiry. They took all my information and forwarded to one of their technicians (plumber) to get a hold of me when they would be by . Jessie called and gave me an ETA of 30-45 mins and he showed up in about 30 mins... he introduced himself... had booties on to not track dirt into the house.
Jessie explain what’s he was going to do after I let him know what I previously tried with no avail.  He was willing to answer any questions asked of him and able to keep up of what was doing. Jessie was able to keep his work area clean and dry . After using the Rooter twice , he successfully unclogged my drain and educated me on the correct way of of taking care and what not to place in the disposal
The price for what I was quoted was as advertised $77.00 versus 149.00 from Elk Grove. Add the professionalism of Jessie and the service he provided... I’m telling all my family and friends to use the Heroes... Rooter Hero
Sincerely

They went above and beyond to ensure our plumbing was repaired. They even went as far as to repair the concrete that had to be removed at no additional cost. I would recommend them to anyone. Adam's professionalism and advice set the standard for what customer service should be and then some.< /Review>

<Review>Poor customer attitude by the repair person Gregory in Sacramento. He made the problem worse and then asked for more money to fix the issue.
His boss William who is in management and sits in LA corporate office demonstrated a similar callous and indifferent attitude of “take it or leave it” and “ you are to blame” to “ its your problem”.

There is no spirit to help the customer in a partnership mode, specially when his service people made it worse due to not following proper steps and checks.

The one star is for the phone receptionist / call center ladies who were kind and emphatic and promptly called to update the status.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

Soon after I posted the below comment. Patrick the head manager for the Sacramento area called. He listened and promptly offered to refund my money no questions asked and to send a senior technician out to investigate and fix the problem. He also assured me that the other technician was new to the work and would undergo training indicating that his behavior was not representative of the company. I was amazed and probably on hindsight was quick to judge the company rather than the individual.  We all make mistakes and it's what we do to learn and rectify that matters. I am pretty confident that Patrick exemplifies the true nature of his company and am thankful to have chosen them. Thank you Patrick. Thank you Rooter Hero.

Very poor service. There service model is to lure you with what they say on website and when they show up at your house make iexcuses to jack up prices. What started with offer to clean a clogged sink @ $77 went astronomically up to a quote of $750. Guy claimed he was using g a 35ft snake. I could sware by watching he hardly used 10ft of the snake. I paid them $80 even though they failed to fix it and decided to look for another company much interested in business by helping fix customer problems then business by gouging customers< /text>< Rate>

Trever Lucero came to the rescue on my rental home! It was a clogged toilet and he took the time to make sure it was flowing back again. Very courteous, called me 30 minutes before arrival, wow what a service, made sure clog was cleared. Did I say he honored the $77 dollar special? Unbelievable service! Trevor Lucero is the man !!!</review>

<Review>Israel came out at 8pm just before Christmas and literally saved the day.  Not only did he clear our kitchen line, but he also went under our house, inspected the lines for leaks and problems, and was a total professional!  I highly recommend this company if all their workers are anything like Israel.  Thank you Rooter Hero Plumbing!!!< /Review>< GmapID>

<Text>The technician/manager came out on a Sunday. Extremely friendly and professional. Diagnosed problem with sewer line and competently proceeded with repairs.  Communicated all issues accurately and thoroughly. The only problem I had was the cost. My ignorance of these type of repairs coupled with my need for expediency left me in a poor position to discuss charges incurred. Had no time to obtain other estimates as my sewer line was corrupted and in need of immediate repair. 5 stars for the service and work done but somehow I think I paid too much.</Text>< Response>

Troy was so professional and friendly and walked as through all the options and possibilities relating to our sewer problem. He even got on the phone with our home warranty company and called Greg to come out and check our pipes with the camera. They had us cleared in no time for less than I would have paid through home warranty! Thank you!!<//text>

<review>I was very pleased with your service technician Raffaele.  He was very polite and let me explain why  I thought line had to be routed from sink to tank. He was quick and dI'd a good job.
The line had been cleaned by another company on 1/3/2019 at cost of $300. It was under warranty so I called them out and they wanted another 300 dollars . So I refused to have them do it again and called your company who did it for $77.  I will certainly call you for our future plumbing needs.< /review>< name>

I was having a big problem with my sewer line on a late night , I call several places with low availability, then Hero Plumbing took a fast response and sent me a great Plumber named Jesse, he showed up to my house really fast and explained what he was going to do to fix the problem
He was really professional and knowledgeable about his profession , took care of my problem the same night!< /Text>

Rene and his supervisor, Adam were the two gentleman who came to do repairs needed to fix a stoppage in our kitchen sink. Unfortunately, we couldn't contract with them to fix the problem because of my 99-YO mom's limited financial situation.  I am a fan and will call on them again because Adam, the supervisor said he would refund me the charges (still pending with my credit card) because the job was not completed and they could not come up with a "fix" that could accommodate us financially. I respect a company that is fair and honest and employees are thorough, professional, and courteous, which is why I am making this post. Thank you Adam for being such a stand-up guy and representative for Rooter Hero! Rene and Adam make a great team in the Sacramento area. Thanks guys! Addie M.</Review>

<text>I called Rooter Hero for a clogged shower drain. They had someone out within an hour to fix the clog. I had Jesus come out and he was an absolute pleasure to work with. He was very professional and even went above and beyond by offering to clean up the mess from the back flow. If you are ever in a pinch, these guys should be your first call.<//text><gmap_id>0x809adfc579fe8665:0x35d85eea3f944408<//gmap_id>< date>

<review>Called with a plumbing emergency, tub backing up while washing machine running. Curtis thankfully was here to check the sewage line (real issue) within the hour and clear the line.

Camera inspection to be done tomorrow, free of charge, to see if there if a pipe issue as well, as that is what he thought was going on.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x809adfc579fe8665:0x35d85eea3f944408< /GmapID></record>
