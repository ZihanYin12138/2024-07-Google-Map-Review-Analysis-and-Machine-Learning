<Review>I cannot give these people enough stars! Ramish (Mish), Anthony and Trisha went above and beyond in more ways than I should probably disclose. They have earned my lifetime loyalty...

PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE TELL EVERYONE YOU KNOW TO TAKE THEIR CAR TO CALIBER COLLISION!!!...

They repaired my 2006 Honda S2000 back to utter beauty, using the poorly fitting aftermarket bumper, and crafting and sanding it down to actually fit and make all the lines match perfectly, which is far from how it arrives from the manufacturer, as people who buy body kits are aware. Also, red is hard to color match, and they did so perfectly! I had a front end accident on the freeway (fell asleep at the wheel), wherein the front bumper was utterly smashed, airbag deployed and seatbelt locked. They even replaced one of the headlights and repaired the other by buffing it back to that brand new clear lense that you only see on new cars. No more of that old car foggy headlight look. Plus, they clear coated both headlights so that they remain clear, preventing me from having to have it re-buffed twice per year. Also, now my Honda logo on the steering wheel is new and shiny, instead of the faded peeling one that was there before.

They were extremely patient with me, provided amazing (truly amazing) service, and did even more for me than I have described above; however, as I said above, I do not think I should disclose everything they did for me because they went extremely above and beyond for me.

Mish and the staff were completely empathetic towards my passion for my beloved S2k (car) and the difficult situation in my life that I am currently battling. They were down right inspirational with their kind words, understanding and service.

I was so happy to see my car in such great condition, accompanied with their beyond expectations service that I gave them all numerous hugs (seriously, many many hugs to each of them), and even a kiss on the cheek to Trisha, as they truly took great care of my car. (Yes, I hugged my car too.) My convertible top is badly torn back with a gaping hole and they took the care to keep my car inside and made extra sure it was inside before it rained (my car was in the shop during the rainy season).

The entire staff also took part in taking exceptional care of my car, as they greeted me upon my picking up my car. Everyone from the parts ordering department, to other customer service staff greeted me with smiles and help. I am sure more technicians in the back also provided my baby (car) the same love, affection and great care that sacred automobiles deserve.

And they detailed my entire car too; so, it was completely shiny and beautiful all around. Even though the top/roof is gaping open, they managed to wash and polish the whole darn thing. Truly amazing service.

And of course, they worked with my insurance company (Allstate) flawlessly. There were additional supplemental costs associated with my car’s repair due to the aftermarket parts and extra work needed to make them actually fit, and I did not need to intervene at all, whatsoever. I just received email updates from my insurance company and the staff at Caliber Collision advising me of the expenses being paid, handled, taken care of, fixed, etc.

I cannot thank the team at Caliber Collision enough for their truly amazing, above and beyond, beyond expectations service; so, please spread the love that they put into their work and into the universe, and bring them as much business as possible.

THANK YOU MISH, ANTHONY & TRISHA!!!
THANK YOU CALIBER COLLISION!!!< /Review><userid>110801239210686371262<//userid><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>This place and these people are simply FANTASTIC. The best in the business. Not only did they keep us constantly updated on their progress, but they were unfailingly  courteous and polite. The repairs were outstanding and the paint match, if not perfect, was beyond my ability to see any differences. When a couple of issues occurred from the repair process, they quickly, courteously and professionally solved and fixed the issues. Simply outstanding. Highly recommended.<//Review>< pics>

I came in for body work on a 2020 BMW 530e. Small fenderbender. They fixed it up quickly and with 1st class work matched paint and even repaired a small ding on the side that I paid for separately. Great work.</text>

Caliber Collison did a great job fixing my car, with a quick turn around time! The staff was really friendly, professional, and respectful.  There facility was nice and sanitized. They even sanitized my keys when they gave them back to me! And had my car washed!  I would recommend them and return if I needed more things fixed.</text>

Caliber did the repairs on my car after it was hit. They finished the work before they said that they would. They installed some parts that I was planning on installing myself before I got hit, which I really appreciated because they didn't have to do that. Their communication was great. One issue was that the paint on my new bumper has a minor flaw and they missed some of the damages to the paint on the side of my car, but you REALLY had to be looking to realize that the paint was damaged there. They are easy to work with though; as soon as I told them they told me to come in and let me know that they'll set me up with a rental and get it fixed for me. I'd recommend them!< /Review>

Caliber Collision repaired our vehicle when we were involved in a minor accident.  Although the damage to the car was minimal, the rear bumper needed to be replaced. To our pleasant surprise, the work was completed in one business day.  The car looked brand new and didn't look as though it had been in an accident. The offices on Easy Street are very inviting and cool. They arranged to have the car rental delivered to their premises, so we didn't have room to go to the car rental office. They made it easy to hsve the car repaired.  Hopefully, we won't be in any more accidents, but if we are we'll take our car back to them.< /Text>

This AUTO BODY shop is the best in the west. Everyone there will take the best care of both you and your car. They have fixed my little white Scion's front bumper twice because I wrecked it "twice" and I wouldn't think of going anywhere else. Their motto is to restore your regular rhythm of life as soon as possible with your car back and they live up to their promise!!! Remember CALIBER on EASY STREET in Simi Valley east of Madera. They are also recommended by the Auto Club & TOYOTA.
The manager has the best personality and attitude and is ever so helpful and understanding. The staff is great. What a dream team!<//Text>

<text>I stopped by for an estimate on my bumper.
Anthony came out to begin the estimate and after looking at the bumper, he got on his knees and back, looking under the bumper and around it, and said he would be right back. He brought some tools and said let's just see if we fix this. He made it almost perfect :) He said he would send an estimate if down the road I wanted to replace it. I offered to pay for the services he provided and said no charge. Great, friendly service with a smile. I highly recommend Caliber Collision. Willing to help, not just take your money for a fix. Much appreciated!!  Thanks Anthony!<//text><username>1st Class</username><Date>1566504922157</Date><UserId.>106011186429385166170< /UserId.>< gmapID>

<text>This is my third service request at this shop. Jason has been moved to management so I met Mich, he was the best. He sounded so enthusiastic when I called that he could help me I was like concerned it was an overpromise. I have an older car, a flex, and it was squeaking like crazy. He popped in my car and heard it. Asked me if I could hang out for a bit. Then I popped back in my car and he said they’d applied some glues they hoped would make the sound stop. It made no sound and when we pulled back in he parked in position for me to leave. I said let me come
In and pay, he said not to worry about it, it was a small matter, it may not hold but he hoped it would and he appreciated my being a good customer and it was his pleasure to help me out. The squeak was so loud before and I got to drive home without it. So far so good and even if it doesn’t hold, I will appreciate his super can do attitude. It’s hard to find. Thanks for taking good care of me !!< /text>< rating>

I want to thank Jason and his team of professionals.  From the ladies in the front to the technicians in the back that were all very polite and helpful.
No-one likes to have their car in a shop for any length of time but they were fast courteous and EXTREMELY professional.  They seem to care about your car as much as you do.
The smiles and friendly attitude is very much appreciated.  I not only refer business to them but have been coming to them since the days on 101 auto body.
Fantastic family ambiance meets Corporate and makes for a great experience.
My Car looks great!  I even thing better than before!

<text>Mish and Stephanie were amazing when i came in for a second opinion Mish took my car in to do warranty repairs that another caliber collision refused to fix. Mish is all about customer service and kept me informed the whole time and even replaced my bumper which the thousand oaks location refused to do. I felt very welcome and involved in the repair process. When i got my car back its looked like the day i got it from the dealer. They cleaned the inside as well my car never looked better. MISH NEEDS A RAISE he is wonderful and really makes you feel welcome. Wherever MISH is im following jeep up the good work MISH your a great asset to Caliber Collision.< /text><Name>Black Panda<//Name>< Time>

They were able to sort things out with insurance companies, provide my rental car (and I could drop off the rental at Caliber- I didn’t have to go to Enterprise first), and answer any question I had.

Caliber Collision was very good about keeping me updated on a daily basis while my car was being repaired. They took care of all of the damage, and the car looks brand new again. They completed the repair in exactly the time estimated and handled our payment efficiently when we came to pick up the car. I will definitely go there again.<//text>

If I could give less stars I would. I recently had my tires slashed and my hood keyed. I had heard great things about this place sonorous my insurance company I would go here.

I had my truck towed into them and was given an estimate of $1,300 in damage for two tires and a hood to be painted. I was then told my one tire did not have enough tread on the tire to be insured, I was okay with that but the quote for one tire from them was $277 in top of my deductible. I had already done me homework and that exact tire was running $157 at other locations.

So I told them no I would get my own tires and I would leave the damage to my hood because I was not going to pay 800 for two tires and a hood painting. I then asked them if they were going to fix the damage to my rim they had done while it was in their shop,( they drove the truck on the rims and scratched them) they then told me no the deal was we do no work to your truck, if we did we would get the rim in and you would have to pay the marked up price. First off I shouldn't have to pay for the damage they have done to my vehicle.

Needless to say I am seeking legal action. Do your homework before you take any car here they are only in it for the bottom line and could care less if they scam you out of your money.</text>

<Text>Bait and switch. Sent Gildardo Benavides (but goes by "Jerry") very detailed photos. Spoke on the phone and through email, very specifically describing the type of repairs needed. He agreed, and quoted me a price of $175. Arrived to drop it off, all the sudden, he blamed his painter for being unable to do the job we had discussed. I'm a former estimator, any painter can do what Jerry and I agreed upon. At no time did his painter even go look at it. Jerry tried to shovel a $325 repair on me. Wife and I left with a wasted morning. Beware of the bait and switch with this place, especially Jerry.< /Text><time>1416943465493<//time>< rating>

< review>
Beware of this place! Extremely shady business! Worse body shop ever!  These people in this place are something I’ll tell you. I took my bmw 435i to this body shop after my accident in June they were a preferred Body shop recommended by my insurance. I had a minor scrap on my passenger side fender and lower fog light cover had been damaged from my accident and their so called quality check is an absolute joke when I got my car back I noticed that my front headlight the new one they put in wasn’t synced properly with the left one and it was emitting high beam lighting on the automatic light setting. There’s more my front bmw license plate emblem plate was put upside down. My hood was left completely uneven my driver side floor matt was damaged only good thing they did was wax and washed the car. So I take it back again for them to fix what I said so I get the car back today from their second attempt to make things right was an epic fail. My cars exterior and interior are filthy my front driver side matt isn’t new or repaired like they said and my other matt on the passenger side doesn’t match! My mirrors are all jacked. I’m convinced they were joy riding in my car the radio was playing Latino music when I got it back now my speakers are making a rattling noise. Why in the world are you touching my infotainment system in the first place it’s not your car why are you messing with my things. I couldn’t even get in my car the drivers seats was so far forward at that point I’m fuming you can hear me cussing and yelling there so called manager was on the phone and couldn’t come yea right talk about a shady business and my insurance recommended this horrible place think I need to change my insurance company if they are dealing with establishment like this. The level of service here is atrocious there is none just downright pitiful and pathetic don’t touch peoples things shows your business has zero respect for its customers so much wasted time dealing with these crooked people!< /review>

Customer service was not good, did not pay attention to what I was saying and had to repeat multiple times. Then food came out wrong.  Tastes like a regular wabash grill</Text>

Ordering was easy. No lines in the restuarant.  Employees were friendly and accommodating. They were also observing social distancing. The bathroom was closed for cleaning. The order was ready very quickly and as always tastes so good. They were still offering the 2 chicken bowl for $11.< /Review>

Be very, very careful bringing your car here for anything other than tires. These guys are not skilled or trained at complicated auto diagnostics. Their default is to tear your car apart, destroy things and then charge you for them to keep trying different ideas rather than admit they aren't trained mechanics. Once your car is torn apart they'll have leverage over you to keep milking you for money.
They charged 80 dollars for one lug-nut. 100 dollars for a 1 ft plastic cable. And lots of 160 dollar "diagnostic" charges. Then I got my car back with parts on the floor  that had not been reattached and the interior and exterior covered in grease.
The biggest issue with Benson Tire is really their inability to diagnose and fix real problems. I left my car for a two day fix and it turned into 10 days without a car! 6 days in the shop and then they sent me home with a car that wouldn't lock. So it had to come back not for one day but 4 more days because they were "sent the wrong part". Or more likely they had no idea what they were doing and were simply ordering random things and trying them out all on my dime!
Finally I get my car back with a part that doesn't work properly and am told it works 'well enough and my car is 10 years old so I shouldn't expect the part they fixed to work perfectly.' I literally was stunned. And you will be too at their incompetence.
I'm tempted to take them to small claims but that seems like insult to injury.
This place is like a bad TV commercial parody of the auto shop you never want to end up at. You know the one where the mechanic with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth and coke bottle glasses scratches his heads while looking cluelessly into your gutted car and disgruntled employees in the back ground drop things and wipe grease everywhere.
Honestly they order their parts from the car maker dealership so it truly makes more sense to simply take your car to the dealerships certified technicians and get top notch, guaranteed work in a shorter amount of time then have your car put together wrong and delayed for 10 days. And then have to pay someone else to fix the new problem created by Benson Tire!
Avoid this place at all costs or your car will be be destroyed and you bank account as well.</review>

My husband and I had to have our vehicle towed into a tire shop in Oakland. The service guy was very unclear on the pricing of the cost of the tires for our vehicle. Calling the shop to authorize work was a nightmare. They installed some bogus entry level tires and marked them up like 100 dollars each. Long story short go to a place where you can trust the products and services done on your vehicle. Stay away from this shop unless you want to over pay for service completed incorrectly or over priced.<//text>

<Text>I did read their lowest rating. I hope that they are not true... I was a new customer here and had a positive experience. They told me some of my belts were cracked and needed to be replaced, and so I had them show me. I verified it was correct by googling an image of cracked belts and they were telling the truth. So since they were honest about it, I decided to trust them to diagnose the problem of starting up my car in the morning because I had to press the gas pedal to get it going. Their diagnostic was that the throttle body and fuel injectors appeared to not have been serviced ever or in a very long time. The guy told me that to replace the parts it would be super expensive but that they could clean the parts out and it should fix the problem. So that is what they did. I have not had a problem starting up my car so far, it's been a few days. So we will see what happens. I'm content so far. Only reason I don't give a 5 stars is because I believe the price I was charged could have been less than $301.00, since the parts were only about $50, and I don't think it took them 2.5 hours to clean out the system and replace the belts.

But for now, thanks guys. If my car continues to run smoothly I will return.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Rating>

<Review>I want to try this shop because its near my house. I took my wife’s car there, for rotation. And I also told them about vibration when wheels turn all the way. They told me that I need new axles. I was little bit surprised that I need new ones, and axles can be cause of vibration. But I told them to replace it, if it fixes. After few hours I came back to pick up a car. I ask them to show me old axles, they show me axles that had dust on it, and it wasn’t from my car. And on top of that they did not fix anything(vibration), they damage seal while replacing axles and my car start leaking oil from where axles join transmission. And when I ask them how come I steal have vibration, they told I need to get new transmission. Witch made no sense at all.  Before I drove way, I decide to check wheels nuts make sure they’re all tight. And what you know they forgot to tight them, and they told me that I am good to go. I tightened then with my hand. At that point I was extremely upset, so I decide just drive home like that(2 blocks). And do it my self. Next day I took my car to a friend shop. All I need to replace is motor mount cost me about $60, not axles, not transmission. I regret taking my car there.  They might know tires, maybe very simple repairs, but they might forget to tight something like ur wheels. I would never take my cars there. If you looking for place where mechanics don’t care and don’t know what they are doing, but everyone very nice this is a place.<//Review><gmapID>0x808f873c01d82007:0xc026876e7220d986<//gmapID>< name>

Excellent, affordable, fast service. Because of the mixed reviews by others, I dropped by to check them out first. Chatted with the owner,  who is like-able and trustworthy. He gave me a much lower estimate than the dealer. So, I dropped the older Honda off for rear shock replacement and an oil change. They finished it in less than two hours and it is running great. Will go back for regular service there.</Review>

< review>
I've driven by this place a lot and just assumed it was another shop trying to scam or whatever. But I took my car here a few times for some emergency work and I've been really surprised. They are all super friendly they get my car worked on and out pretty quick. They know what they are talking about and very personal. If they don't know what the problem is they check it out and they always give me results on the cause of the problem which seems to be difficult for others. I really enjoy bringing my car here and I will continue to do so.  I highly recommend them to anyone and if you have a problem you should probably check to make sure you're not the problem. I see no issues with them.</review>

<Review>**THEY'RE PETTY CROOKS - AVOID AT ALL COSTS**

If you read other reviews, you'll find this place has a long history of taking advantage of unknowing women.

I had our car towed here because it's near our house. I put two new tires in the trunk that I had bought at another tire shop. All Benson had to do was change the tires. I was having surgery, so my wife picked up the car and they charged her $75 for changing two tires.

I knew this was an insane overcharge - the highest price for mounting and balancing a tire is $20 each and thats at a dealership. So I called back the next day and posed as a customer looking to do that exact same thing - have 2 tires put on. They quoted me $26. When I then told them what had happened with my wife the day before, they made up an almost hilarious and absurd list of things they had to charge extra for, trying to defend the overcharge.

The car mechanic industry is riddled with petty crooks like these guys who take advantage of people (especially women) who don't know anything about cars. It's time we did something about these gross misogynist bad actors.< /Review><Date>1524342972346< /Date><Pics>None</Pics><rating>1< /rating><username>Walden Alexander<//username><Resp>None< /Resp><userid>103359628079292421914<//userid>< Gmap_id>

got a flat tire, at first they told $550 out of the door same original tire, the guy think I have no choose I must pay what they ask, I told him I can order in Tire rack $300 only, I am taking the car back home(I live around the corner), the guy ask me to wait, and jump back to the office, came back in 2 minutes and give me a new price $380 out of the door with the same tire. What a joke, he did a 2 minutes magic to save me $170. I understand they need to make profit to pay for the shop, workers, but not taking advantage other's trouble.< /Review>

Benson's has serviced my cars since I moved to CA six years ago.  Victor, Ken, and everyone there is unfailingly polite, honest, informative, and communicative.  The work is superb. Prices are fair  I will soon be moving to Marin Co. but I will bring my car back to Oakland to have it serviced.  That's how strongly I feel about Benson's<//Review>

<user_name>Benjamin Nagel</user_name><rate>1</rate><text>I know Automotive shops usually have a bad rap, this one is deserved.
I took my Jeep in for a throttle body issue. They had it for 2 weeks, when i get it back, after the replacement of the part was made, and the problem is actually WORSE.

They then tell me "Well it could be another part/sensor", sure makes sense. Why would they call me to tell me to come pick it up when its idling at 2,400 RPM? They said they had it much lower than that... I never left the lot it was so bad.

They then have the car for another 4 days to put in sensor, never called me to talk or explain anything. I call and ask whats up, am told that they are going to put the original part in and give it back cause they can't fix it.

I have NO problem taking my vehicle somewhere else. This place is useless. NEVER going back.
If you unfortunately have to go here, pray you don't have to deal with Robert as your tech.</text>< Gmap_id>

Took my car in for oil change and rotation. I was told I needed to replace leaking rear shocks -- ok.

When I pick up my car there's a new warning light on -- they messed up an ABS sensor, which on my car means the ABS system is off. They won't fix it today ("we're closing"), so I need to come back at 8am next Saturday so they can fix a problem they created.

Gary could have cared less that the ABS system in my car is off until I can bring it back.

Go somewhere else to find mechanics that value your safety.

UPDATE 3/29. Took it back -- turns out they ruined both ABS sensors on the rear wheels. Ordered parts, and they rented me a car to use while they do the work. Oh, and they lost the lug nuts for my wheels and had to order those too. I had to ask for them to rent me a car -- Gary kept saying that the ABS system "is a backup" and saying that it's fine to drive around with brake warning lights on. I'll post about how this all turns out -- supposed to get my car back tomorrow.</Review>

They are not what the pretend to be ,this place is a first class rip-off hiding
behind GoodYear's good name, I spent 800.00 dollars there only to find  the
new parts still in my trunk there alingment for 120.00 had to be redone same day
or else destroy my front end If you go here you will not be happy with your decision
Sears Auto much cheeper and they realy do the work also each mechanic at Sears
is ASME certified un like Bens-tung Tires Good Tires no mechanic there is ASME
other than the expired licence on the wall  This place is a fools stop
if you dont hear me BENSON Tire is a Rip-Off  cleaverly discuised as a good year
tire shop    Dont say you havent been warned</review>

<text>I had a coupon that was emailed to me from Baskin Robbins. That motivated me to look for one near by and invite my cousin-in-law. Especially that it gets hot out here.

The cashier was very nice as we walked in and welcomed us. I wanted to try a few and she assisted me with that. There was no one at the line so I didn't mind.

A man finally walked in and I was still undecided. She turned to him and asked if she can help him. I didn't mind since it was just one person. Well, after 2 buckets of ice cream and waiting for 10 minutes I was ready to tell her something.

When he was done she apologized. She said she thought he was just going to get a cone or something quick. She didn't want to make him wait. I said it was fine and left it like that.

I tried the Reese's® Peanut Butter Cup Ice Cream and it was delicious. My husband got the Wild 'N Reckless Sherbet and he liked it a lot. We put it together on a banana split with another scoop of Chocolate Chip Ice Cream and we were done.

My cousin-in-law got a scoop of Banana Split Ice Cream in a cup and her daughters got a soft served vanilla cone. They all loved the ice cream.

I noticed they had other offers on a huge banner indoors. They were also giving out small coupons that were for family night. It was a $0.99 scoop of ice cream after 5 pm.

When i was ready to pay using one of my coupons she apologized again and said that they don't take those coupons. She explained that the owner only accepts the coupons that are given at this location printed on the receipt. What a bummer.

If I would of known earlier I probably would of taken into consideration one of their offers on the banner. She said she felt bad told me about the $0.99 scoop after 5 pm.

I was going to go back so I told her not to worry that we were just visiting from Los Angeles and we were heading back soon so we couldn't go after 5 p.m.

They have a shared parking lot and we found a spot right in the front. All the tables were available too because there was no one inside.<//text></record></dataset><record>

It was my first time going to a Baskin Robbins...I know where have I been.....but it was really good. They have a good selection of ice cream. The 2 flavors I got were Rocky road and Reese's peanut butter cup. Omg. Makes me want to go get more. But the prices are kinda high for just a cup of ice cream. But it is what it is. I don't make sell or produce ice cream so I don't have a clue what it actually cost or what it should cost so that's why I'm giving 5 stars. This particular one was very nice and inviting and they wished me a good day when I left.< /Text>

Terrible service, ordered a cake and paid for it in advance. When I went to go pick it up they said the cake maker had not made the cake and this was not new. Apparently the manager doesn't care since this isn't the first time this happens.</review>

<Review>I was told by several people not to go here, that they were awful. Now the wait was kind of long, but that was my fault. I am pregnant and didn't know I needed a release of liability form from my OBGYN in order to get X-rays for my teeth. Did this cause them to turn me away? Hell no! I gave her the number for Kaiser, my medical number, and she called herself and got the medical release form faxed over.

I haven't gone to the dentist in awhile. These ladies hooked me up! They got me fitted for visalign, took X-rays, and got me a whole dental kit, toothbrush, whitening tooth paste. The whole package!!

I will be back in a week for my follow-up from the X-rays, and I honestly cannot wait to see everyone. I had such a connection with the staff. Thank you Cristina Perez for all your hard work and helping me out!!</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<review>I have had a few dealings with this office and had to speak with the manager about an urgent issue and asked that was told to call back in 15 minutes I called back and the manager was still busy and then I said okay I'll leave my phone number and you can call me back never received a call back. I called before closing and was basically hung up on.

I am normally very nervous going to the Dentist because of a traumatic experience at 12 years old. But when I visited the facility on West March Lane I felt at ease with the Staff and treatment of Dental Services.
I was great after that. Wonderful experience for me.
Thank you so much.<//review>

A quick but thorough experience at this WD. I transferred from LA County to San Joaquin County so it was my first time coming to this place. I was amazed by the professionalism and etiquette which made my experience extremely worth continuing to go to this WD. My last location was also good but this one just surpassed my expectations. Got everything I needed to do and continue getting dental services at WD. Everyone here works as a team and each person does their best to achieve great service. I don't just want to thank one person but rather everyone that I saw today and will probably continue seeing while I'm going to this WD. My experience in the past with WD has always varied with good and bad reviews alike but this was probably one of the best experiences I've ever had this far. This location is truly the best so I hope it stays that way. Hope that everyone gets the best service possible as it should be.< /text>

Wait time is super long and my daughter and I were super irritated, but a young man by the name of Marco Cortes apologized and explained why the wait was so long, made us feel welcome, a lot of patients that day but he gave my daughter a sticker and she was happy. Overall customer service here outplays the wait time.<//Text>

<Review>Just moved to the area and needed a new dentist. Found this office because it's close to home. The front desk receptionist (forget her name but started with a K, Kara or something) had a smooth checkin process and the middle eastern dentist was thoughtful and explained everything smoothly.

Although this place has som wait time , there staff is super nice and make you feel at ease when talking about dental work. I’m afraid of the dentist but a gentleman there by the name of Marco Cortes made me feel excited about my teeth, he educated me on my teeth and what I had going on and also helped me find the best fiancing options. If you guys come here request him he’s the best!<//review>

My oldest daughter that is 16 had an consultation for braces this morning  they said only me and my oldest can go in the back but my two younger ones that had mask on they told me they had to wait outside?? Im thinking in the waiting room but noooo they Mean outside the building by the parking lot outside... 2 kids ages 11 and 10 wait outside without any adult supervision. I will not go back even after covid is over..I felt so uncomfortable that they even said that.. and so upset<//Review>

<Pics>None<//Pics><Rate>4< /Rate><text>My daughter goes to this dentist and I really enjoy the friendly staff that they have as well as offering water and coffee my only request is that they actually look over the paperwork to see what the child's afraid of. My daughter has autism and sensory issues and I feel like they're not very aware of it even though I put on the paperwork and let them know so I think that they need to really take into consideration the way that children may I actually feel. Also when you schedule appointment a appointment it should happen then and there and you should not have to be waiting especially with a child who doesn't do very well waiting .other than that I've never had an issue with the staff or bringing my daughter here she feels very comfortable.</text><name>mero< /name>< Gmap_id>

<review>I came to Western dental with hopes of doing my semiannual dental visit but it didn't happen. After waiting an hour I was told I have to be seen another day because I wasn't covered, which is far from true. I feel as though they don't do their due diligence the admin was ready to send me away without checking if I was covered. After about 10 Mintues she realized I do have dental coverage. 30 Mintues after that I was told they could not see me because I was pregnant. Really, I filled out the paperwork when I first arrived 2 hours prior and you're barely noticing you wouldn't be able to see me. You're joking. Not fair. In addition to that when I came back they stated they never received my doctor's approval for my dental work(she didn't even bother to check). Too much of a hassle & I'll have to pass on Western dental from now on. I would never recommend it to anyone.< /review><rating>1</rating><Response>{'time': 1578698350770, 'text': 'Ariyan, we are sorry to hear about this situation.

I love Western Dental & Orthodontics. I have been visiting  the one on March Lane,  and for the number of visits I have had,  I give to them five-star. The staff are warm, friendly  and  welcoming. They remind you of your appointments in a timely manner. They treat the patients with respect regardless of race, age, color,  personal ethics and beliefs, just to highlight a few. The doctors and all involved in any kind of procedure approach me with empathy. I  feel I am always at the right place whenever I visit Western Dental & Orthodontics on March Lane.< /review>

<text>I had an excellent experience here recently, being new to the area and in search to establish care with a local dentist.  I made an appointment and went in with questions, having rough experiences in a previous office, I was weary.  But I had Jeanette M. set my mind at ease, she was sweet and very professional, definitely an asset to this office.  All my questions were answered and I left the office knowing everything about the appointment and treatment that I need.  I look forward to returning for the work I need done.</text>< Pictures>

I've gone here for a year or so. A couple months back they pulled my front teeth and made me partial dentures. I cant eat with them, and they never adjusted them. I called the number and a person was supposed to call me to resolve my issue, but never did. I went again to try and get a cavity filled, tiny cavity, they wanted to do a whole root canal and replace my tooth with a crown. Hard no. Will be seeing another dentist.<//review>

Brought in my son for his appointment, staff and doctors were very friendly. I was a little nervous from things I had heard. I was completely surprised how great everyone was, a bit of wait but they offered coffee and water. The girls in the front were awesome! I would recommend this office to Family and friends.< /text>

I want to start off with me being the scariest person of dental offices. This office has welcomed me and made me feel comfortable. I love there staff! They also worked out a payment plan that I could afford. I still have stitches and need to have a few more visits to get my full dentures to fit properly. But at the end of the day I know I feel good when I smile again without covering my mouth. THANK YOU ALL.... Tammy Dutye</review>

<user_name>Tyler Brown<//user_name><text>This place actually makes me ENJOY going to the dentist! Amazing staff and high quality service. Wait times can be long on busy days, but they let you know ahead of time and offer free coffee during your wait. I used to have an extreme fear of seeing the dentist which I'm completely over now. I had a LOT of work done here and the whole staff was very helpful through it all. My dentist was obviously very experienced and really friendly.

I was originally afraid to go to this place because of the reviews you see on here, but let me tell you that you shouldn't believe them. I have recommended this place to neighbors, friends, and family already. I plan to continue using their services for any future dental work I have done.

<Review>New patient. Arrived at 3:15 for my 3:30 appointment. Taken back at 4:15 for xrays. After xrays, waited until 5:30 to see the dentist. Diagnosed with way more cavities than expected. Done with cleaning at 6:00. All in all, a new patient exam and cleaning took nearly 3 hours. Bad experience. Seeking a second opinion from another dentist about the cavities. Won't be back to this practice.< /Review><user>116980248439201498320< /user><Response>None<//Response>< Name>

I've never had a bad experience with this particular Western Dental. Sometimes the wait can be long depending on if you're going for Ortho or general but every visit, I leave very satisfied and never in pain or anything. Once I'm checked in, I get called within 5 minutes so thats never been an issue with me. The staff, dentists, and orthodontists are very professional and are excellent in what they do. I never spend more than 15-20 mins in there (for braces and regular checkups). Very pleased< /text>

I had a very bad experience. I go in for a tooth ache, and the dentists say it’s my wisdom tooth, and the procedure would cost me more money than I could afford. Simple enough, I look for other dentists, and I found one that I could afford. I set an appointment with the other dentist.

Western dental then calls me to tell me my assurance had been approved and my extraction would be free, so I cancel with my other dentist and set up a new appointment with them.

I then wait for 3+ hours, x-rays and all, for them to tell me the EXACT SAME INFORMATION they told me the first time. Same price and all. Waste of my time and terrible management. Avoid if you can.<//text>

Arrived to the March Lane and Pershing location
I was just put in a waiting queue not super long but not short.
I was told on my last and first visit, the extraction would be done first, makes sense ,since a cracked tooth is why I was visiting.
I explained to them with this cracked tooth in my mouth? hurts.
So not only should it be first ,but was first .
I wasw being preped for cleaning or filling, I kindly stated, I'm just here for the scheduled extraction. if it's not happening today, I think I'm going to take off.
I used Lyft so it cost me to go there. and under the belief that a whole different operation was being done and now they slap me with that.
then they say oh no ,we have  a doctor is here that can squeezes me in , although it was already scheduled so thanks againai guess.,.
cool nurse Ingrid very attentive and cared .
she was lovely,however ,wait till you hear how i left violated and not a dam thing helpfull .
Dr Wu was horrible, very rough carelessly, grabbed a needle ,as if he was mad at me and went into my mouth and stabed deep and hard, so deep it  hit bone,  painfu.
a few minutes he comes back grabs the syringe again, he goes and grabs thea needle again and aggressively stabs my tooth. where I was already numb .

I said to the nurse when he walked away, he was kind of rough he's kind of aggressive and she said to like let him know like to slow up a little bit hold up so then comes back after I'm thinking he just was letting it get now only to pick up the needle again and was going for my mouth and I said oh that's okay sir it's and she but thank you I'm alright he says to me.
I have to do this if you don't let me do it then I'm not going to do the procedure and I said very well and got up and so he got mad and stormed off like I did something to offend him.
I did not feel safe on his hands because he clearly wassnt considerate or patient.

make sure it was numb great okay but painful so then they gave it a few moments and he comes back and was like okay and picks up the needle again and says I want to make sure it's numb .

now I already expressed that he was kind of aggressive and my mouth was clearly numb already ,
I told him I don't know that that's not necessary it's numb.
he got offended and said well then we can't do the procedure if you don't take this third stabij.
so I replied okay then I'll have to reschedule and he stormed off.
Sono tooth extracted ,Dr Wu was very unprofessiona and result of that I didn't get what I needed to get done because he did not trust the customer that actually was the one feeling and hurting.
I don't see how that made sense for him to not want to keep going cuz I didn't want to get stabbed a bunch of more times in my mouth.</Text>

Sam made sure I didn't have to walk around without a front tooth until getting it permanently fixed. Forever grateful.</review>

< Review>
When I made an appointment for my nephew, who is in my care through the foster system, I asked what documents would be required at the time of the appointment and was assured it would only be his medical card and my ID. Again, I made it clear that I was a foster parent and did not know or have access to his history. I called again before the appointment to double check what I would need to bring and was  again, assured that I would only need his medical card and my ID. When we arrived for the appointment he was refused care because I was not the parent and did not know his medical history. I offered to email or fax proof of his placement with me and was refused. The employees were rude, unwilling to help, and seemed completely ignorant on what, specifically, was required to get him dental care. When I asked for the contact I formation of a supervising manager I was refused. When I attempted to file a grievance online the form would not submit. There was an option to print a grievance form but no information on how to submit that either. The only positive that came of the experience was that my nephew was probably spared from dental work as shoddy as their customer service.< /Review>

What is the purpose of making an appointment if your not gonna be seen at that time. It doesn't make sense. Come on now, or time is valuable just like yours.
If u miss your appointment they'll probably charge you. I think we should start charging them for not being seen at out scheduled time.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

So disappointing.  I was so happy yesterday when they told me that they were accepting new patients and that they could get me in the next day.  I arrived 10 minutes early for our 11:00 appointment for a routine x-ray and exam.  After waiting patiently for an hour and 15 minutes past our appointment time, I approached the receptionist.  Asked her about how long she thought it would be until we were seen.  She then told me that there were 3 more patients ahead of us to be taken to a room, that all the rooms were full at the moment and that there were only 2 dentists on duty today and that they were bouncing back and forth between routine exams and issues.  After explaining that I had an appointment I had to keep at 1:15, she suggested that I come back another day for the exam part of the appointment.  I talked to her about the day that my other children would be coming in and she let me know that there were 3 doctors on duty that day and that she could not tell me what kind of wait it could be for the amount of patients that they had on the list for the day.  So, long story short, if you have to use this dentist due to insurance situations, plan to be there for a long time.  I truly felt that there was no respect for the amount of time that any of the patients in that room had waited to be seen, and yes there were a lot of them just sitting around and waiting.< /review>

I went for an infected tooth, the first time I was there I was upset that the dentist and the assistant talked to each other and not me. I felt slighted. I went home sore and miserable after my cleaning also. but on my second visit I was treated by Carol. She took the time to answer ALL MY QUESTIONS and sat down and looked me in the eye and spoke to me directly about what was about to happen and what my follow-up care would consist of. She was very gentle with me. I felt fine when I went home and had no pain at all. I hope I get to see her each and every time. She gave me a new outlook on their facility< /review>

Don't be fooled by any good reviews this establishment has. If you actually take the time to read the reviews, you will notice that all the bad ones say stuff pertaining to the actual medical work....i.e. "they pulled the wrong tooth".....and all the good reviews pertain to how nice the staff was i.e. "Ingrid was very nice here's 5 stars"

The reason for this is that in order to raise their horrible rating,  they developed a strategy. The strategy begins at the dental office, where low status employees beg you for good reviews. When you go there, plan on being asked by like 5 people, from the receptionist all the way down to the janitor,  for a good review on google. They approach you with a card in hand, with their name written on it and say "will you please go to google and leave me a good review it really helps?" They do this throughout your appointment, but especially at the start, before you even have anything to base your rating on. They are pretty aggressive about it.

The reason for this behavior is this: if they get enough people to give them five stars because  "Maria was friendly", then hopefully it will drown out the seriously bad reviews,  like "the doctor was careless and rushed through my work, resulting in a new problem tooth that now requires extraction that wasnt neededn before "

This is the strategy that keeps their business afloat. If they didn't actively solicit good reviews for minor things, their whole review page would be full of patients sincerely unhappy with the medical work they received.

I commented about their bad work on a random Facebook group and within a day got 7 likes. Because people who know the truth know this place Is garbage.

If you must go.....absolutely don't let the young Indian or middle eastern girl doctors work on you. These girls have no business being in the dental field, let alone being doctors at all. Beware! Especially if you're poor, because if they think you can't afford  lawyer to get justice, they will  exploit this, and give you rushed,  second hand work.
Literally the worst medical establishment on the face of this earth. They're biggest concern isn't providing patients with good care, but rather rush them through and make the most profit with the cheapest,  fastest work.

This place sucks. And I hope I can save people the pain and suffering of learning the hard way. When it comes to teeth, you want to make sure you have a doctor who cares about their patients,  and these doctors don't fit that description in the least bit.<//text>

<text>Avoid if at all possible. JENNIFER who answers the phone is amazingly rude and doesn't know her ass from her mouth. Plan on being there for about 3 hours before you even get your x-rays. After your x-rays they make you go sit in the lobby again for another hour or two. I was there 5 hours with no treatment done. No info on what needed to be done.

If I could give this place zero stars, I WOULD! My first time was ridiculous. I showed up 20 minutes before my scheduled appointment and wasn't seen till after 50 minutes of my scheduled appointment. The second time coming, I was brought into the hallway entry way where they examined my teeth and later gave me fillings for my third visit. It was uncomfortable because people are constantly walking behide you and there's no privacy! The way the dentist had drill on my teeth caused my teeth to break two days later, while chewing on a PB&J sandwich. The forth visit, I came 20 minutes before my scheduled appointment, filled out paperwork, and sat for an HOUR in the Waiting Room. Clients were being called and once I finally got up and asked what was going on, they said I wasn't going to be seen because it hadn't been 6 months yet. THEY SCHEDULED THE DAMN APPOINTMENT!! Western Dental has been emailing, texting, and calling me to remind me of this appointment and couldn't tell me that they made a mistake?! I'M BEYOND DONE WITH THEIR SERVICE. And the professionalism in this establishment needs improvement-- too many personal conversations that clients can hear while in the Waiting Room.< /text>

This is my second review for Western Dental. It feels like my last review was treated with a level of dismisivness which i found irritating, and therefore gave me the desire to write a new review, addressing the issues I have.

First off, I should mention that I do not recommend this business to anyone who cares about receiving quality dental work. Honestly, if I could, I would have given this place a zero out of 5...but 1 is the lowest score I could give. I believe that medical doctors have a responsibility to provide their patients with the best care possible. Doctors get paid a pretty nice paycheck, and even on their worst day, I feel like its their obligation to provide the best quality work to ALL PATIENTS, despite the type of insurance they have, or the financial status of the patient etc.

The funny thing is, there are a million good dentists who provide great quality work. Unfortunately for me (and anyone else who chose this establishment), I picked the one in a million dentist that is actually no good!

Western Dental has responded to my original review, pretty much with a summary of all the good things I said, and several excuses as to why their subprime treatment is actually 100% my fault.

I dont have lawyer money to take Western Dental to court at the moment, but at least I can warn others of this place so they don't have to go through the same thing, and suffer due to a young doctor's neglect.

Ive already told my story herr but in a nutshell: I needed a bunch of extractions.....they specified which teeth needed extractions, and which were salvageable, by drilling and filling them.

They did the drilling/filling first.....and completed it on 2 separate dates. There are two young female doctors there, who I believe are of middle eastern descent.....i mention this because I dont know either of their names....they look like they could be sisters.

The first doctor girl did 3 drilling and fillings on the first appointment. The wait wasn't bad, thr doctor spent a good chunk of time making sure her work was done correctly, like a good doctor. I had no problems with any of her work, and left a happy patient.

The next time, I got 2 drilling and fillings from the other doctor. I do admit, it seems like they are overworked, which could lead to poor work, due to fatigue....but on the other hand, i work construction, and even after 8 physically demanding hours, i can still perform well.

So on this second day....i waited in the DENTIST CHAIR, not the waiting room,  for almost 2 hours. Finally, the second young doctor I previously described appeared, amd began aggressively drilling on my tooth. O was very surprised that these 3 teeth were completed in half the time it took the previous doctor to do 2 teeth. I wonder why that is? Is she just a better faster doctor? Haha, no.....she just didn't care to make sure she had done a good job....especially for a poor medi-cal recipient, who probably wont have the means to complain or sue if anything happens. What I should have done, and encourage anyone who still chooses to risk getting work for western dental, is video taped the procedure.....that way, an irresponsible doctor, or dental office will feel obligated to do a good job, since this would put them under scrutiny. Seriously guys.....your teeth are important....they cost an and a leg to completely replace.....and Western Dental WILL NOT try to make right with you any teeth they destroy....so keep the camera on with these guys.

Anyways.....the next couple days, both the latest fillings fell out. Upon doing a google search, I learned that this is VERY UNCOMMON, and probably due to poor dental work, which fit with my feeling of the work being super rushed.

Later on, the other young doctor girl tried to make excuses for her colleague, placing the blame all on me, but this was later.

Im out of characters....will write a part 2.<//Text>

< Review>
This is a bad review. Honestly, after going yesterday, my impression has transformed from a positive impression to one that is negative.
Before I go into all that, I want to say the few good things I have to say. Firstly, the dental assistants are very professional,  and did their best to make me feel at home and comfortable. They are the hard workers of this establishment and if this review only pertained to dental assistants such, as Sherryl, Ingrid, or any other dental assistant I worked with, whose name I can't remember, I WOULD GIVE THIS BUSINESS 5 STARS. If the young doctors' practiced the same professionalism of that of their assistants, this would be a great establishment.

Also, and I hope you forgive me for my lack of short term memory, which results in another forgotten name. The lady who takes care of billing and payments was very nice. She also is someone, like the dental assistants, who works in this profession with the desire to help people.....I have bad credit and couldn't qualify for the 6 bone grafts I needed, but got them anyways through a good faith loan from western dental itself. They charged me $1000 for 3 grafts, and the extraction specialist stiched in 6 grafts. Fortunately , I have good parents, and my father payed my bill within a week, for me.
I can't stress enough, that the employees I mentioned above are 5 STAR EMPLOYEES, and I don't want anyone to think that my 1 star rating has anything to do with them,  because it doesn't

So I have to back up to 2 appointments ago, when I was getting remaining filling done on my teeth. I waited in a chair for most 2 hours, when finally the doctor came in. I don't know her name, but she was one of the younger ones. She rushed my fillings in what felt like ten minutes, but could have been longer. Nonetheless, I was very surprised at how fast she finished. It honestly felt very rushed. I'm no dentist, but I don't think she did a very good job, seeing that my first filling fell out within a couple days. The second filling fell out shortly after my tooth extractions, 2 appointments ago.
So yesterday, after almost a whole month of waiting , and walking around with my front 6 top teeth missing, I was very excited to go get the dentures I've been waiting for.  Upon entering the establishment, I was pretty much told that my dentures had been delivered , and my excitement was shared by some of the staff,  whom I had previously dealt with. I was stoked to say the least. I was so happy with the work, that before receiving the dentures, I signed up for another in house loan, for another treatment.....at this point, I was under the assumption that my work was complete, and I was to leave with what appeared to be a full set of straight teeth

A few moments later, the assistant Sherryl informed me of the bad news: There were too many bubbles in the last mold, so actually, the dentures weren't coming today.

Sherryl could tell I was bummed out, and was extremely sympathetic. I appreciated this a lot, knowing none of this was her fault, yet she still felt bad about it. She took new denture molds for me, and made sure they were done right. An older doctor was there, and he seemed disappointed in the matter. It seemed like people were huddled around talking in low voices about my situation. They even had the doctor who did my failed fillings come look in my mouth.
Due to my fillings falling out, I now was going to have to have yet another tooth extracted, one I'm pretty sure did not have to be extracted before hand (or they would have extracted it already).
On top of this, I now have to walk around toothless for one more month, while my new dentures are made, or while my dentures are made for the first time , I don't know.
From what people like my dad tell me, in other dental offices, stuff like this never happens.  He said he's NEVER had a filling fall out, period. I am angry because on top of my insurance paying them, my family also forked over $1000 dollars. Only to result in another extraction. I feel like I should go talk to my family lawyer to learn my rights.</Review>

<Review>Was very impressed with the service. I had a million and a half questions...... Jeanette answered them very thoroughly. My ex rays were done my a girl names Kyara, who showed a lot of concern with making sure I was comfortable. Having missing front teeth can be embarrassing, but Jeanette and Kyara both made me feel secure and unembarrassed. Thanks guys, looking forward to getting this work done through you!

<Review>If i could give this place a 0 i would. Whats the point of getting an appointment if were waiting 1 to 2 hours to be seen. Some of the staff dont know what they are doing.  Had a cleaning one time and they slipped and cut my lip.  Made  the big mistake of making appointments for my sisters here. Will not come here again rather go the distance and go to the one in lodi.< /Review>< Pics>

<userid>117140199830448013065< /userid><Review>They had taken the mold for my dentures, but on delivery day, and in typical Western Dental Fashion, they screwed up the work and had to re do the whole procedure. Also they informed me that they had to now extract a tooth that before "Dr. Negligence" had drilled and filled on.

At this point I left my first bad review....and at first they were super apologetic in the reply to the review. Upon going to Western Dental, some girl, and the better doctor of the two girls kind of cornered me and began questioning me heavily. I felt very uncomfortable and didnt want to talk about it right that second. I felt this was pretty obvious, but they were kind of insistent. That's ok, but here's what Dr. BS told me.

First she tried to say that they never drilled and filled those teeth, period. I guess she was hoping that I was someone with very low intelligence and bad short term memory...
But unfortunately for her, I dont have either of those qualities. Therefore I informed her of the fact that I remembered the procedure perfectly. She tried to argue with me about it a little more, then switched excuses, now saying they did do the fillings, but their strategy is to "try and fill them, not knowing of the cavity is too far gone for it to hold or not....and that if it falls out its just luck of the draw."......now im like wondering "what's going on here? Lol! Is this even a real doctor?"

What kind of doctor would say something, switch stories completely, and then provide false information about the procedure. I know this to be true, because they took several x-rays.....wonder what those are for? Not to determine the size of the cavity? Lol. So I just nodded my head. And she became quiet when I told her that if they intended on extracting the tooth,the would have made the denture to include the tooth that now all the sudden had to be extracted.
What really happened is the first incompetent doctor saw i was a medi cal recipient and therefore rushed through my work. And when you do a bad job on drilling, the fillings fall out. And since she drilled so much out, now I lost a tooth that would cost 4 grand to replace.
I took my dentures and left. Im not letting these doctors who dont seem to know what they're doing or atleast dont care touch my teeth ever again.

So yesterday i get a grievance packet thing from western dental. First they mentioned how I "commented that the staff were exceptionally nice and professional etc"

I only commented these things, because every time you go there, the staff practically beg you to leave them a review. Out of 4 times or so ive gone there, ive been asked to leave around 20 reviews. Its so crazy that in one visit, ill leave with 4 or 5 cards with staff names written on them. On different visits the same staff members would ask me again. The reviews are whats most important to these people....over providing good work, they are more concerned with you leaving a review.....asking you in the first five minutes before even providing any care. Thats the only reason i left those comments. I mean ya the staff was cool but nothing so amazing id leave a review lol.

Then they said that the reason I sat in the dental chair was because i was late. I dont think i was late, but if i was,it was less than 5 mins late and didnt warrant having to sit in a DENTAL CHAIR NOT THE WAITING ROOM for more than 2 hours.

Then they tried to say oh your tooth has to now be extracted and we've made you a new denture....like making extra dentures is something they do all the time,and not because they screwed up by over drilling my tooth resulting in a new tooth that didnt have to be extracted until Dr Incompetent went to work on it.

Or are you saying "we dont regard the xrays.....we tried to drill and fill to see if it might work, and went ahead and made your dentures without checking to see if it did in fact, work.
I do need to try to contact an injury lawyer because these guys are really shady. And i hope people read my comments and try a different place. I mean there's some places out there that take medi-cal that are really good.< /Review></record>

< review>
Had the worst experience back in 2013, hence my not returning there. The dentist was rude, condescending & made me feel less than human. I was in the period of recovery for a double mastectomy & this experience I DID NOT NEED. I'm trying the Western Dental on West Lane hoping I have a better experience but looking over the reviews I'm not really too hopeful. Why is the cooperation so inept & displaying such unprofessional conduct? I'm going to send letters to the Corporate office to get an explanation of the horrible service issue. Had to give it one star because you cannot post without marking a star. It truly deserves - - - - - Stars</review>

From all the times I had to go here for things such as fillings or a crown, I was forced to wait for more than 3 hours each time. If it were up to me I wouldn't go to this facility anymore. The dentists there seem to lose track of the patients and it's quite annoying to see them pass by my chair every 10 minutes without second glance over to me, as if I'm not a priority. I go here, I miss school, my parents miss work, and for what, to wait for over 3 hours for them to do nothing? I would never recommend this place to anyone.<//text>< user_name>

<text>I wouldn't have given any star if I could. This place is the Worst Dentist! One receptionist was super rude when we when we went there. I get that every one has a bad day so I dont hold it against her. I don't know what she was going through in her personal life. But I thought it was worth mentioning.
When my mom went in to her apt the Dentist, or surgeon was Terrible!!!!! He numbed her and Imediately after numbing her he started to cut out her tooth. Not even allowing the medicine to work. Then when she made noises because, it was Hurting... He told her to be quiet because she is scaring other patients!!! Can you believe that? She said she felt like he was heartless and didn't care at all that she was in pain. He didn't even stop!!!! He even left HALF OF A TOOTH IN!!! Yes!!! He removed half and left the other half inside... We are currently looking for another dentist office... I will NEVER recommend western dental. Not even to my worst enemy!!!! I'd rather pay out of pocket then to go here even if this was the only place that accepted my insurance!!!!
I hope that no one ever experiences what my mother went through!!!! It's Dental Care not Dental DONT Care!!!!< /text>< gmapID>

Stay away from this one, it's a pain in the a😤😤. Have you set up ready and you probably think that soon Wil be your turn but 3 hours later you still waiting. I don't know why in the world it's still in business. When you call to reschedule appointment, they will put you on hold for 30 mi just that 3 min of a change. Poor poor service.

<Review>Went in to get one tooth taken out, one! You would think this would be a no brainer for a dentist to pull a tooth that was causing me so much pain because of an exposed nerve I was in tears! After waiting 3 hours, I was told they couldn't pull it that day AND it would be 2 WEEKS before they would because they wanted to take out my bottom wisdom teeth at the same time. You would think they would have pulled the tooth there and then, then delt with the wisdom teeth at a later date! The office manager was rude, and dressed like a hooker. She became even more rude and belligerent when i declined the extra services they suggested and said i did not want to apply for care credit, and on top of that, she wanted me to sign forms giving them permission to bill my insurance for the extractions even though they hadn't done them.  Not only am I leaving this review to warn others of their obscene conduct, but I'm also filing a complaint with the California dental board.  This office was dirty, rude, and unforgivable!</Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< GmapID>

Any Western Dental I've ever been to is horrible. They make your appointment and then have you waiting for over an hour just to put in the back  to have you wait for another 30 minutes to an hour.<//text>

<text>I Show up on time and sat in the lobby for one hour then was finally called back to take my x-rays then they told me to go back in the waiting room. Waited one in half hours in the extremely cold office to be finely called back to sit in a very cold chair for the dentist to look at my teeth then said to the assistant that i had a cavity and didnt even tell me and didnt even ask me if i wanted to fix it today they were just going to do the procedure anyway. The only i knew of this was because i heard them talking about doing it. Then i sat there for 20 minutes to finely get told to sit in another chair to wait another 15 minutes.  I just came in for a check up and cleaning. My appointment was at 12:30pm and it end at 3:39pm. Do not recommend.<//text>< pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Last month I had a SCHEDULED appointment at 10:15 am, waited for about a 45 minutes to have x-rays done, then waited for a bit over 4 HOURS to just be placed in the back to have been told what work needed to be done then had to wait another 45 minutes to have had NOTHING done! I had an anxiety attack because of the waiting while the staff calmly had conversations about how one of them "looked different because they had gotten a haircut before their return." I spent my entire day there and skipped class. The staff is horrible, all they do is have conversations with each other, judge each other, and walk around the plaza as well. I walked out at exactly 2:45 because I wouldn't have had a ride home. That was the second chance I had given them. THIS IS THE WORST DENTAL PLACE IN STOCKTON, clearly NEVER returning.</Review>< pics>

I had the worst experience ever .This is the first time I'm writing a review for anything because I don't ever want other people to make the same mistake I did by going to this place. Just a brief background, I went to western dental because my new job only offered this prepaid insurance and that means I can't go to my awesome dentist (dr.pulido) because that would mean I would need to pay out of pocket coz he only accepts PPO. I only needed cleaning every 6 months, so I figured why not just go to western dental since its near my place and I dont really have extensive dental problem.WORST DECISION EVER. I felt like this place is a scam! Waited 30 mins to get an xray and waited over an hour to be seen by the rudest dentist I have encountered Dr. MY HUYNH.I am a very patient person and the least demanding patient a doctor can have I know that because im a nurse myself, but this doctor is just plain rude.I waited for over an hour which does not make sense because thats why you have an appointment so you dont have to wait that long and when she came she didnt even introduce herself and made me feel uncomfortable she was talking to me like im an inferior and ignorant person.The only information she provided me was the obvious one,I knew I had tartar thats the reason why I went to the dentist for my 6th month cleaning like I routinely do,every 6 mos.She diagnosed me with gingivitis, really?ok that i may need to clarify with my trusted dentist..but then she got the nerve to tell me  I need braces too because I don't floss enough and she said my teeth was cramped together, I felt that she was just trying to squeeze me for my money and she said all this stuff in a very rude manner.Talk about customer service.Felt like I was getting scammed right? Then I was surprised that shes leaving and I asked her,"so were not going to do the cleaning?" (the only reason why I was there in the first place)she said the first meeting is always a consultation and will set an appointment for the treatment, I was never informed that the first visit would be a consultation only , dont you think that would be something important to inform the patient?at the back of my mind I was like are you kidding me, after all this wait? I have never experienced this going to my regular dentist. And the assistant told me that I need to pay $622 out of pocket for cleaning because its not covered by insurance im like really?I thought it is covered every 6 mos, and they said that because its a different kind of cleaning,it requires gingival irrigation or something like that. I came there for cleaning and they did all these services that I didnt even asked for I wasted a few hours of my life going here.They charged my insurance $504 for nothing. This place should be shut down, all they care about is how to get the maximum money out of their patient. None of the staff knows what they are doing, the place is not well maintained and unsanitary IMO. Ive been with my regular dentist for 5 years and never did he require me to do any of the listed services above, i know for sure my regular dentist would warn me ahead of time if i needed these procedures done. Its like going to a mechanic asking for an oil change picking up the car with new tires and engine. After this experience im going back to my regular dentist even though I have to pay out of pocket. TO EVERYONE DON'T WASTE YOUR VALUABLE TIME GOING TO WESTERN DENTAL BECAUSE YOU WOULD NOT GET THE DENTAL SERVICE THAT YOU NEED AND DESERVE IMO.</Text>

I called and talked to someone over the phone to help me find the next available appt. and they were very nice and helpful. i called back at another time to the actual place on March Ln. in Stockton Ca. to cancel my appt. and was transferred to another line to talk to someone else but they just hung up on me after that i tried calling again to tell them i was disconnected and i heared the girl answer the phone and then hang it up... i called once again and she finally answers to tell me she is helping a patient and if was ok if i was placed on hold. i told her yes that was fine. I work in customer service and i can not believe how rude she was to just hang up on me and not just take a quick second to put me on hold. i am very understanding and am willing to work with any situation but to not get the same treatment in return when i haven't even done anything to them to deserve that really pisses me off. i can see why a lot of people have nothing nice to say about western dental. Maybe they need to check their staffs attitude when helping customers in stressful environments or youll be losing a lot more people each day including me.!!!!< /text>

The place is horrible fist of all very dirty the floor, the walls, the walls on the X-ray room drunk people in the waiting area or who knows if they were in some type of drugs this tells me that staff at this location don't really care for the safety of there patients imagine if there doing a cleaning on a drunk person and she/he falls off the chair but then I was maybe I'm wrong I should give them a chance but when I got to the X-ray room I saw the X-ray walls all dirty then saw the X-ray guy not used any hand sanitizer or wash he's hands before touching the gloves that he was going to use to tuch my mouth That's when I that it was time to walk out never going back to this place how ever I have to mention this the lady's at the front desk very nice ladys and good customer service<//review>

Giving one star is even too much!!!
I don't understand how you schedule appointments and people are still here 3 hours after their scheduled time!!! If you don't have 12 hours of time to dedicate in one day, DONT MAKE AN APPOINTMENT HERE!

I've had a scheduled appointment 3 times now and it takes hours for them to call you. The first time I waited and it was about an hour and a half before I was called back JUST for X-rays. The second appointment I got called back and was supposed to get numbed for an extraction and that didn't even happen. An hour later they told me my mouth should have felt numb a long time ago. Well yeah it probably would have if you guys would have came in here to do it. So I left and rescheduled just to come back today and have been waiting an hour and a half and still nothing! I asked if they have a problem with overbooking people and I was told no. Then she told me I could come back next Tuesday (the day the oral surgeon is in the office) at 8:30am. So I said alright, would I be the only one scheduled for that time? She says no theres 2 other people also scheduled for 8:30. WTH!!!! That is overbooking!!! I'm so over this place. I will be looking for a different office in the future!!!</review>

Terrible wait times and dentist is rude. Waiting for 2 hours to even get x rays. Haven't been seen, I asked how much longer 30 minutes ago to be told I'm next then they called other people instead. Worst place ever.</text>

Place is a little messy and crowded. Dentist was very friendly. After we were brought in, had my son sitting in a chair with tools in his mouth as they attended someone else. Left him this way til I reminded them of his existence.</Review>

Plenty of parking available. Bring cash just in case you are paying for admission to see your kids basketball game or you will have to drive to a bank lol. There are restaurants and a smoke shop near bye with good folks working on them.Note:the some shop (smokies)has an ATM.<//Review>

<Text>I don't speak Vietnamese, the ladies don't speak much English. However, there is one customer who kindly helped me out. I asked for vegetarian sandwich. It's $4. That's a lot. I could get one cheaper at Lee's Sandwich. The customer told me I could go to Ban Mi Che Cali for cheaper sandwich but this place is good.

The sandwich didn't taste like vegetarian at all. I couldn't tell what ingredients were in it. Judge for yourself, is it vegetarian?

I gave $5 to the lady. She walked away without giving me my change. I stood there waiting for her for 1 minute for the change.<//Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOUKN7Giz5Hoo_XNsP6yMioE4TaHnRhepDMEAYA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNIxomFO5NDqs4cH1KQJWpZkY2pQHWJdM9-z-tW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80dd27c0d2ef97cb:0x33d776f8da3966a0< /GmapID></record>

Rude. Raise the price because we doesn't want to take the togo food that she insisted to sell. We end up buy it with high price because it doesn't matter, but they deserve a true review for bad customer service.<//Review>

<rate>2< /rate><Text>One of those frustrating CASH only business so the owners can hide income from the tax man while sporting ginormous rocks on their fingers! Food gets left out for who knows how long and usually ends up tasting spoiled by the time I get it home (roughly 15-20 min drive) if I pick up items on their counter. I saw cooks stick their finger into the food they were cooking to taste it, stick their finger into their mouths, adjust seasonings, stick it back into the food again for another taste, and immediately transfer the food into a tray to sell.  I guess their germs are a special ingredient! Their Vietnamese salads are kept in the fridge and are a "safer" thing to purchase. Prices are fair and the food is decent enough for take out, but I personally don't like carrying cash so I rarely go here unless someone requests food specifically from here. In most cases I try to sway them towards something else since this place is out of my way and I'm not a fan of places that are allergic to using a register and clearly only accepts CASH and rings people up verbally to avoid having an electronic and recorded money trail lol.< /Text>< pics>

Great party trays here!!! The Vietnamese food to go here are great and I love the salad party trays from here.  I must say that don't add the sauce fish to your salad before you try it because my experience is that you don't need it.<//Review>

<text>Their Vietnamese ice coffee is on my top 10. Swing by in the morning and you'll have no problem with parking. This is a food to go only shop so no tables for you to eat. They also specialize in party trays.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Like any other asian food stores all the usual items you find eslewhere is here.  I like it because its within the same plaza as Stater Bros. I bought myself some fried shrimp chips and some asian cookies.  They do sell party foods ready to go in a tin container for you to buy. Easy place to find. You might need to come early though if you're heading here or bring an extra friend when coming to this plaza because sometimes it takes awhile to find parking. You can just drop off someone to head inside to buy some food while waiting for a parking space.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dd27c0d2ef97cb:0x33d776f8da3966a0< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I would give the place 3 stars for the food and 4 stars for the mung bean slushy drink.  However,  the lack of order and difficulty finding parking really dropped their score.

Dang,  people don't know how to get in line here.  Either they do the slow crawl to cut in thinking that you're not aware,  or they just straight out raise their hand to get the cashier's attention and cut in front of the line. Seriously,  how long do you have to be in America to learn some f***'n manners! Rude,  rude,  rude!!!<//review>

Went here to buy a coffee with condensed milk (ca phe sua da) and had to wait for a long time to order. There was nothing comparable to a line, and when it was my turn to order, a rude guy cut in front of me to order. The server saw that he cut but ignored the fact that he cut and took his order before mine. There are no number systems or lines of any kind, and people who work here are mindless and rude. I would never give this place my business ever again. Come here if you want to wait for a long time for your food because they don't have a line system, also come here if you want to be treated with no respect. Don't come here if you value your time and don't want to unnecessarily waste it. I would give this place 0 STARS if that was an option.<//text>

I was excited to try their bun bo hue since this place was highly recommended by one of Vietnamese friend. It turns out I didn't like their bun bo hue as much as I enjoyed the ones from Ng Binh. This broth didn't have the same intensity of deep flavors.< /Review>

<Review>Woodford/Markleville (spelling? ) anyways a great little town to visit. Great fishing on the Carson River. Some of the best angling here in Northern California!!! If you like camping there's a couple nice places to unroll your bedroll and enjoy one of nature's beauties. So get on your bike or in your car and get outside!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

The junction is a relatively small highway intersection. Roadwork in 2020 has been completed and there are few delays. Nearby meadow, mountain tops, and lazy brook are picturesque.</text>

This is a very good place for fun any time of the year. Beautiful nature, clean air, mountains around.
During winter you can ski over there. The rental price is very affordable. $35 for the boots and 🎿for adults, and $20 for kids.
The parking is small.< /Text>

cool little parking area to overlook the river and have lunch and go for a walk. Some nice swimming holes to enjoy down along the river but be careful during the spring time when the water is moving fast. Nice paved trail and more adventures dirt trails go east and west along the river. Lots of old gold history in this area and Native American history. Plaques in the parking area to read about. Bathroom in the parking area as well.<//Review>

Fantastic spot with hiking trails!!! beautiful!
River with the rapids, all the scenery and all the nature. I got invited here because it's allegedly approving spot in the area and so I went to meet up with this boy but it was so flipping cool there that I just wanted to hang out even after he left like I just love the nature and it's just amazing breathtaking there</Review>

Was a place for rituals and ceremonies for the Wintu Indians in days of old. The place feels ancient and sacred. The stone formations are beautiful and there are plenty of jumping rocks, swimming holes and rapids to tube down. Some graffiti has been added recently so if you feel the need bring a brush and scrub some off.< /Text>< response>

I'm sure there's a few fines here and there but it's been picked over pretty good by the old timers.. lots of improvements over the last several years including picnic tables and covered areas to sit.<//Text>< pics>

<review>Such a beautiful place not far from town.  Plenty of trails to walk and lots of wildlife to see.  It's a shame there is also plenty of trash to be found from inconsiderate losers that party and swim there in summer.  The main area is well taken care of with restrooms and plenty of seating for a picnic.<//review></record>

My dog and I appreciate the trails here with their varied terrain. At times you can see the creek below.
The overlook itself affords a good view of the creek as well. There is a bathroom, picnic table, and a good amount of parking.< /Text>

< Review>
This is a breathtaking vantage point that is friendly to dogs, seniors, disabled persons, and children. Many points along this road offer beautiful vantage points and adventures, but this has to be the most comfortable for a diverse range of people and circumstances. The parking lot is a little weird, but is not usually full, however if it is you can park on the road it does not add too long of a walk to the view if it is needed. When in the parking lot you already have a beautiful view, clean bathrooms, covered!!! viewing areas which is a must in the summer for this area and extremely hard to find, and you are just as far from the outhouse door as you are from the rail to see the view. Trails available for those who are interested, and they veer off in both directions down the creek. Highly recommend for anyone disabled or with limited mobility/endurance but wanting a gorgeous view. Creek is usually quite rapid in the fall/winter months.<//Review>

Great view of rugged nature up close, plus you can go one of the many trails if you want to get closer. Shots of wildflowers & places for rock climbing!
One of my favorite spots.</review>

<Review>They are slow so be patient.

Easy drop and hook.  The shipping staff are usually pretty decent.  FYI this is a distribution center they do not have retail or a service department.<//review>

<Review>Visited on 5-28-19. Appointment time at 2pm. They checked me in at 1:10pm the time I showed up. From security shack you report to dock 28 to get a dock. I got a dock right away. They started loading me at 2:30pm. They finished loading me at 3:10pm. You then report back at dock 28 to get your BOL/paperwork. They issued me a seal which was secured to my trailer door at the security shack. Personel at facility were all friendly.

To enter facility exit Sierra Ave off the 210 and travel North. On Sierra Lake make a right and then a left on Mango. Drive straight to the security shack where the street ends.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Zero!!!!!!! OMG! Unprofessional, I left my car to pick up my order but they said I have to come with my car to pick up my order! I had to wait 45 minutes to get my order at 3pm on Thursday! It is not a busy hour to give just one burger!  They really need training to improve their customer service! She slammed the window front of me!!! How could you treat your customers like this!!! Need to change the manager as well!!!</text>

<Response>None</Response><text>I didn't go to this place. I'm not sure why I'm being asked to review it. I haven't had any of their products since 2004. The last thing I had of theirs was a "breakfast burrito" of some sort. We ordered there out of desperation because there was nothing else open in Dallas that early on a Sunday. It was absolutely disgusting, inedible. It's been deposits only for me in their locations ever since. I do have a large banner of theirs that says "McWrap". I took it because everything they offer is McCrap and the irony was not lost on me. Not sure who still eats their products or why. Have they not been to an In-N-Out yet?<//text><time>1601712947512<//time>< pics>

I've used the app to order here this time. When I arrived, they had no order for me on their system. So I reordered everything and paid again... (The manager said I would have to go through the app to get my money back from that order.)  And pulled up.  Anyway, while I'm waiting for my second order to arrive at the second window the manager comes up and tells me, 'Your other orders just showed up on our system.  I'm just going to refund your money from the first order now and get your current order. And then I sat there at the second window (where she said to go and wait...) and waited for about 7, 8, cars behind me in line, get their order and drive off before I drove around back to the front and ask them if they forgot me.  As soon as I drove up to the window they had my order ready.  The employees were very nice here, but I can't imagine going back here anytime soon right now...<//Text>

However I came here to put in a good word because in comparison to other McDonald's restaurants in the greater area, this one seems to be exceptional.

I can't seem to remember anything missing from an order.  The cashiers seem to be on the ball.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, their Cafe Mocha is always hot.   I will SHARPLY contrast this with Lafayette where the Cafe Mocha is always luke warm with all the chocolate syrup sitting on the bottom of the cup.  I've stopped going to the alternative completely and take the slightly out of my way Monument to hit this one.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

Our food is either wrong or missing more often then not. I have ordered a double cheeseburger, only to get home and find that  one of the meat patties where missing, even though the wrappers where correct. They never mix the Mcflurrys! It is so frustrating that I get a mess of ingredients do to either laziness or lack of training! Management needs to step up. I will go out of my way to not go to this McDonald's.< /review>< username>

This McDonalds is literally the only one where each time I’ve gone I’ve had excellent service and high quality food. Every time order is correct, food is hot, and actually tastes and looks fresh. I don’t know how the magic happens there, but it’s great.</Text>

< Review>
I'm not really big into fast food restaurants McDonald's put a sale on Big Macs for about a month or so and someone Burger I like as fast food and I gained 20 pounds. So I try to stay away from fast foods but if you have kids and you need fast food and it's quick and it's easy then McDonald's is a place to go is definitely a lot cleaner and better than the rest of the fast food restaurants. So it's the least of the of the many evals I guess I'm saying. So enjoy and have a great day< /Review>

<review>Don't go late at night. All the food is cold and stale and gross but mad props for being open at all because Jack in the box disgusts. But also boo for turning the shake maker off.

<Text>I go here often & they frequently mess up my order. I pay 3$ extra to have an additional item on my sandwich & they never put it let alone make it correctly in the first place. The worst part is they had me park to wait for my order in the first place. I’ve wasted countless $$ here & fast food is suppose to be cheap & convenient. Ridiculous.<//Text>< Pictures>

Not we'll run......the other day kids ran around no supervision management at night page no mind to the customer the place in general is very very dirty you spend a lot more time because at the end of a long day at work and have coffee and an apple pie but it's gotten so bad now the way you can enjoy it and not the only one there were several of us you spent lots of time there......... I still drop by from time to hoping something has changed......but no changes...... Where is Taco Bell across the street much better run I spend most my time there now<//review>

<review>Don't like it restaurants but I happen to because of the virus it was the only thing up in french fries for cold like always. It scares the s*** out of me to go there during the virus because I just worry about kids not being as careful. I don't think it's good that all these other restaurants are closed they could all be open for takeout and delivery and they should be. We shouldn't be forced to eat at fast food places. Out of all the places McDonald's is my favorite I'll give it that< /review>< Pictures>

<rating>4<//rating><review>It's McDonald's, so you know why you're here! You're not here to eat healthy, or count calories, you're here to treat yourself! They've got all your favorites but the standout for me now is their fresh beef quarter pounder burger. You can get in a double but a single Patty suits me just fine. The best thing about this is waiting longer for the beef to cook, which is a nice change from ordering the food and eating it a minute later.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x8085612890558ddf:0x125ed0ca2f98a892<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Two lanes for ordering, and a pay windows and order pickup window speed up the process of getting a famous McDonald's meal.</review>

Rude female workers. Manager speaking Spanish in front of English speaking customers. Drive-thru female gave me dirty look and turned away while waiting for service. Only person who cared was Jason and he was being treated poorly too! As a woman, I was very disappointed with the female crew. Jason deserves a better work environment.</Text>

I wish I can give zero star. It’s the worst customer service I ever had. Went at night to Drive-through. The worst experience ever, with employee has an attitude. Long hair Very filthy very filthy Not clean.Cost me more than eight dollars for a biscuit and eggs no meat with the hash-browns. Don’t go there.< /Text>

It's okay. They need to work on keeping the table clean. Other than that this place is okay.
*SAFETY WARNING*
There has been an increase in homeless & shady looking people out front of the door. So be careful.< /review>

<Review>This McDonald has been newly renovated and has two lines now for drive-through instead of one which is a big Improvement. Also inside they have the mobile pick up and the kiosk to order from if need be.< /Review>< pictures>

It's okay. They need to work on keeping the table clean. Other than that this place is okay.
*SAFETY WARNING*
There has been an increase in homeless & shady looking people out front of the door. So be careful.<//review>

<Review>New edit: they actually raised the prices so it's now more expensive to eat here with using the kiosk machines.  Make sure you use credit cards to make their cost go up.

It's a Mcdonalds, quality is ok when you can get food.  They no longer offer customer service and you can only order thru their kiosk machines, and you dont get discount using them, still same price despite not having employees helping you.  Many people in line to order at kiosk machines but lady at counter was unhelpful and wouldnt take my order, she said I had to use kiosk machines and can no longer have an employee take my order.  I dont recommend going here, it's too bad I liked their fries but I guess no longer.<//Review></record>

< Review>
Been going to this location for years. This place has a good crew (usually-sometimes new hires are a bit iffy, but they generally don't last long). Only gotten the order wrong once or twice in all the times I've  been there and they're very quick. Thanks Monument McDonald's!</Review>

<rating>1< /rating><Review>Very slow service, maybe because it was 1 in the morning, but that's no excuse. Also my food was very hard like its been sitting in a warmer all day! Supervisor/ manager poor job. Needs to stay on top of his employees. Hope they read this and make some improvements. I'll be  back to check for any improvements and will update my review.<//Review>< pictures>

I am not a McDonald's fan, but this is a good one because it is brand new and clean inside and out. They have a full-time custodian (Luis) tasked with nothing but scrubbing from the dining room to the kitchen and from the outside to the restrooms.

They have a modern indoor play area for the kids with a bit of climbing stuff and some electric/electronic stuff.

Wi-Fi and electric vehicle charging pods are available.

The building is about a three years old and they have already slurry sealed and restriped the parking lot a couple of times so it looks brand new again. It is LEED Certified.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Very greedy franchise owner. Prices keep on going up, up, and up. The only food left on the 1 and 2 dollar menu is the 4 piece nuggets. While taco bell across the street has a 1.00 complete menu. Very long wait time in drive thru at night. Almost every employee here has a cell phone in their pocket and some are texting while working. Free food and drinks are being handed out in drive thru and front counter to family and friends. Some rude and unproductive staff. Men's room was unsanitary. Bums, crazy and unstable people come into this establishment. Mostly a fatty high calorie expensive menu. Cross reference your inventory with your actual sales instead of raking more cash from loyal customers.< /Review>< pics>

<review>Horrible service at the drive through. How about you tell the person which window to pull up to after paying.  Oh, and how about giving the customer the beverage at the same time as the food?  I had to go back inside for the drinks because I sat at the window waiting and waiting.  Kind of defeats the purpose of drive through.< /review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<name>JC Jones< /name><Response>None</Response><review>Went there at 10:40, they had both menus up so I ordered the qrt pounder meal. Fries were great, Coke was great, qrter pounder was flavorless and Luke warm. Service was rude and slow. They never said hi, thank you, or repeated the order, never said the amount. I asked for catsup and mayo at the second window, she nodded, then when she handed me the bag it had black pepper packet and a mayo. No catsup. They did supply about 30 napkins lol, I guess I looked like I would need them. The drive through was really slow, just one car ahead of me.

8/5/20 - 2 stars

So when you order on the mobile app you can no longer go inside to pick up, and you can't change this option once selected. So if you don't pick curbside delivery and enter your strap number, they make you wait in the drive-thru line which today took a total of 18 minutes after our order was placed. So we are left with cold fries in our car right now...
Oddly, they were able to walk a drink out to us but the girl said she thought we already got our food and did not walk food back out but instead directed us to go through the drive-thru.
Wow...  Totally love cold fries... doesn't everyone?

3/5/18 - 4 stars

This McDs remodeled itself maybe a couple of years ago now. Opened up with a beautiful new building. However, at the time of the remodel, they removed the chocolate flavor from their swirl cone. So now, it’s vanilla only, rather than vanilla-chocolate mix. But aside from that disappointing change, everything else has been an improvement.

The dual drive thru lines are great, even though some other customers have no idea how to merge politely. But not a big deal since you never seem to be in the line long anyhow, as food comes out hot and fast.

We weren’t the only ones thinking about ice cream sundaes and shakes last night; the car in front of us had the same order. Vanilla swirl cones ($1.62 each). So good!< /text>

Then noone seemed to care about my order bc they could find the stupid code in their system!! Left me standing there looking stupid all the while helping other customers and never even checking in between with me or on order!! Finally I asked again, the girl said she didnt have any order in her system and proceeded to try and dismiss me again and I said you need to get your manager up here before you help anyone else bc I'm done waiting! Manager did come up, still couldn't find order but she looked at my phone verified i did everything correctly and excussed herself bc obviously the mobil app isnt working correctly and promptly got my order together and apologized again. Told her thank you but please address your front staff bc they made a frustrating situation almost turn into a gone postal situation.</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>8/5/20 - 2 stars

So when you order on the mobile app you can no longer go inside to pick up, and you can't change this option once selected. So if you don't pick curbside delivery and enter your strap number, they make you wait in the drive-thru line which today took a total of 18 minutes after our order was placed. So we are left with cold fries in our car right now...
Oddly, they were able to walk a drink out to us but the girl said she thought we already got our food and did not walk food back out but instead directed us to go through the drive-thru.
Wow...  Totally love cold fries... doesn't everyone?

3/5/18 - 4 stars

This McDs remodeled itself maybe a couple of years ago now. Opened up with a beautiful new building. However, at the time of the remodel, they removed the chocolate flavor from their swirl cone. So now, it’s vanilla only, rather than vanilla-chocolate mix. But aside from that disappointing change, everything else has been an improvement.

The dual drive thru lines are great, even though some other customers have no idea how to merge politely. But not a big deal since you never seem to be in the line long anyhow, as food comes out hot and fast.

We weren’t the only ones thinking about ice cream sundaes and shakes last night; the car in front of us had the same order. Vanilla swirl cones ($1.62 each). So good!<//Text>< pics>

They always forget something in drive thru, I refuse to eat inside. The place is always smelly and poor upkeep. I love that it shows variety in ethnic customer service however it does become annoying when he employees have attitudes. The managers are the worst employees. There is only one employee that is good. I know he is African American and I think his name is Brandon but Im not positive.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Horrible workers ...
I order a strawberry pie and they gave me a pumpkin pie which I didn't asked for so I told them and they began to argue with me which is something really unprofessional and rude to do to a customer. On the other hand they tried to make it seem like I was a lier when I had my receipt and it was on their menu.

Really unsatisfied with the cashier named !!!!!!!!(DOLCE)!!!!!!<//Text>

They cant get a single order right. Forgot half my order and then told me i never ordered it; even after showing them on the receipt that i indeed had. Saw three people ahead of me in the drive thru throw their food or drinks back and then drive off. These people are morons.<//Text>

<review>(Translated by Google) It gives a lot of courage to ask for something and that they understand you a totally different one !! I ordered 2 BIG frappes! and 10 nuggets ... that was all my order and they came out with (9 nuggets, 2 large coke and 2 small frappes with a different flavor than what I asked for! when I repeated several times what my order was for the same reason that They are always wrong and this time that I told them what my order had been, they only told me “Come back to train in the drive so that they will charge you for your order again.” After having already paid for something that I did not ask for.

Da mucho coraje pedir algo y que te entiendan otra totalmente diferente!! pedi 2 frappes GRANDES! y 10 nuggets ... eso fue todo mi pedido y me salieron con (9 nuggets ,2 cocacola grandes y 2 frappes chicos de un sabor distinto a lo que les pedí! cuando repetí varias veces cual era mi orden por el mismo motivo de que siempre se equivocan y esta vez que les dije cual había sido mi pedido solo me dijeron “Vuelve a formarte en el drive para que te cobren tu orden  de nuevo. 😡 después de ya haber pagado por algo que yo no pedí .<//review><Name>Yaree Olguin<//Name>< user_id>

(Translated by Google) I usually do not usually eat in junk food places, but I must say that I was surprised at what McDonald's is becoming because it has a modern combination of friendly service and a more modern space with the options you have to order, both the direct classic with a person and the new one with these stationary modules where you order and now, but at the same time a personalized, friendly attention and a nice and quite clean place, I can say that I liked it, I just think that its quality is far from being fresh and healthy, but as I always say that is my humble opinion.

(Original)
Por lo general no acostumbro comer en lugares de comida chatarra,pero debo decir que me sorprendió en lo que se está convirtiendo McDonald's pues tiene una combinación moderna de servicio amable y un espacio más moderno con las opciones que tiene para ordenar,tanto la clásica directa con una persona y la nueva con estos módulos estacionarios dónde ordenas y ya,pero al mismo tiempo una atención personalizada, amable y un lugar agradable y bastante limpio,puedo decir que me agradó,tan sólo creo que su calidad esta lejos de ser fresca y saludable,pero como siempre digo esa es mi humilde opinión.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Mack Duck as usual on top. But there is no familiar Russian menu. There is practically nothing that exists in Russia. I always thought that poppy duck is different from other establishments of this class in that you can always come and quickly eat the same sandwich that you ate yesterday, a month ago or a year ago. And his taste will be just that. But in the USA this is apparently not the case.

(Original)
Мак Дак как обычно на высоте. Но нет привычного меню России. Практически ничего нет, чего есть в России. Я всегда считал, что мак Дак отличается от других заведений такого класса тем, что всегда можно прийти и быстро съесть тот же сендвич который ты ел вчера, месяц назад или год назад. И вкус его будет именно такой. Но в США это видимо не так.</Review>
