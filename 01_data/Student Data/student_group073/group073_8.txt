<Text>While the service is good, the employees are pleasant, and the wash is definitely top notch. It is quite expensive and the wash does take a long time. You get what you pay for in this scenario.
My only complaint is that, they were closed down for a long time because of covid and they boasted they would be back and spent their time revamping. The inside looks very run down, if they invested a little on the inside (especially considering how long some people spend there) it would be the best car wash around.< /Text><Rating>4</Rating>< gmapID>

Very impressed with the new owners. Brought my 33' class A moterhome in and they did an excellent job washing it. I also called around and they were the best deal.<//review>

<text>OMG  I NEVER post reviews but this was the worst service I have seen in a year anywhere.   It was NOT busy, and they did about one car every 15 minutes.  Guy I was sitting next to said he had been there 2 hours.  I thought my car was finished 45 minutes after I arrived, realized my car was still sitting exact place I left it.  I had paid already, so told them to get it into the wash, and watched them talk for another 20 minutes and not one car went in

I got a refund, so did a couple others, and we backed up thru the entrance to leave.  Remember  ...NOT BUSY ..so no good excuse.

Avoid this place at all costs.  Can you give a minus 5 star review?<//text>< pictures>

I took in my car for a full wash and interior cleaning. I expected the car to be completely clean and they didn’t clean the interior and they didn’t wash the roof.

Normally I don’t post reviews but I had to this time because I went back to ask if they could clean the car and the manager (and order gentleman) screamed at me for complaining over the way the car was cleaned. They charged me $100 for the cleaning and didn’t do a good job. I’m upset over getting my money stolen and then essentially kicking me out.</text>

< Review>
Absolute worst customer service! I asked for the $28.00 (or $28.99?) service and this big sloppy looking guy said that my car wouldn’t get clean. When I asked what he meant, he said they would only vacuum for 2 minutes and that my car was too dirty. He said I would need to spend at least $65.00 to get it clean. As I was trying to make sense of what he was saying, he said it would take an hour and half because only 3 people were working. There was only 1 other car getting vacuumed and 1 car getting washed. He clearly just didn’t want to work. If I owned this establishment, I would fire that employee immediately. Obviously I left and went someplace else.< /Review>

<Text>This place has become more and more disappointing since its new ownership. Today I decided I would pay the extra to get the carnuba hot wax, as well as the interior detailed with armor all. $50 and when the guy drove it up to me he had not waxed it, the interior was only vacuumed, and the tires weren't dressed. He was told I only paid for the signature wash, which was wrong, so he talked to his manager and then came out and told me the carnuba wax is done in the drive thru. He took the car back to "detail" the inside and when he drove it back to me again, 4 of the tires had been barely detailed and the spare hadn't been touched. The inside looked alright, but he did not use armor all because the was no scent from it. As far as the wax goes, I watched the Jeep go through the drive through portion and nothing was done that I don't get with the $30 wash. Complete rip off and waste of money. I am done with this place. Don't waste your time and $$$.</Text>< pictures>

<text>1st time here. I got the $50 detail wash and detail package. They didn't use an air fresher even though I requested it at the vacuum area and the worst part was they cleaned the inside of my windows with a dirty towel or probably the armoraled towed. Streaks everywhere, so now I have to clean my own windows, every single one. Such a disappointment for a 1st time customer. I was also the 3rd car in line and it took 1-1/2 hours to be done. The only good thing, they have a nice indoor waiting area.</text>< UserId.>

Awesome! Yes, i paid 49.99, which included shampooing of all of my floor mats. They spent over an hour and a half cleaning inside and out.
Well worth the price and time!

Sadly it was closed due to quarantine. We just bought a burrito with their Pollo Loco neighbors and used one of their car slot shades to have lunch. The shopping center is very nice and the Car Wash Wildomar looks clean, comfortable and efficient. Hope they're open back again soon.</Review>

<Text>Once again, this car wash disappoints me. I haven’t been here in 3 years because I was disappointed then. Pull up to the car wash and ask for their super wash. I just need a car wash and my car vacuumed. The employee tells me it will be 1.5-2 hours for this to be completed...
A regular car wash and vacuum the interior?! This place will never get my business and it’s easy to see why most people in my neighborhood (La Cresta) avoid those place like the plague. So if you need your car washed and vacuumed, bring a lunch and something to read, you’ll be there all day.

PS: There was 3 cars in front of me so it’s not like they were busy....< /Text>< pics>

Took my car in to give the new owners a chance due to the horrible service from the previous owners. Boy was I impressed with not only the wash, but the wipe down procedure. The car has never had such care before from other car washes.  Got home, stood back and admired. (Usually I have to do a wipe down when I get home because of runs).  So impressed, hopped in my truck and had them was that one too. A black truck is difficult to look perfect but it did.
I wish the new owners good luck in business. They are trying to overcome the reputation it had in the previous years. I'm truly impressed! Give them a chance. You'll be happy.
This is the one in the Barons parking lot.</review>

Came in to have car washed.  Was first in line and about 5 before the car wash opened. Was greeted and asked how I could be helped. I needed to have car completed within 40 min and because of another appointment.  Immediately they began working on my car to get it done.  I am sitting in lobby writing this and this new ownership has truly made positive changes. Thank you!!< /Text>

New Owner and staff are amazing! Never have I ever had a better car wash. They are meticulous. My car looks brand new inside and out for $18.99!!! They did more like a $100 or more detail for the price of a regular wash. I’m so relieved to finally find a GOOD car wash in our area!! Nice shaded sitting area. Clean store and bathrooms too!</text>

I'M SOLD.

I drive a black Chrysler 300 with 120,000 miles, and faded paint. I originally came in for a wash and wax, but after talking with Santos about paint corrections and just getting some general information, we talked about specifics: waxes, polishes, buff outs...etc. and previous experience with black paint restoration. After showing me a few pictures on his phone of previous black paint restorations they've done and the difference between the service. They even showed me a claybar and wax on a car they finished earlier in the day, and a polish on another car they were finishing up (although it wasn't black paint).

I'll be scheduling a polish later in the month. I'll post pictures before and after for comparison.<//review>

Took my 2004 Land Cruiser there to get cleaned up after a 1,200 mile road trip.  The car looks great, as good as the day that I purchased it.  The staff did not hurry through the job - it looks great.  Everyone that I spoke to there took pride in the business.  The facility was very clean.  When back in town, I will visit them again.<//Review>

<Text>Haven’t been here in years but finally decided to give them another try since they are under new ownership. Unfortunately they are just as bad now as they were back then. Very understaffed and suuuuper slow because of it. The car wash itself was very meh. Once I got home I had to wipe down a lot of the interior because they missed so much. I’ll continue to go to the Cal Oaks car wash from now on. They are much quicker and I pay a few dollars less (with a coupon) for a much better wash job.</Text>< UserId.>

I was just told 1.5 hour wait, I’ve never waited that long for a car wash.
I had to go elsewhere.
No it was not a misunderstanding.
I asked the gentleman (very large, not too tall, bald. )
that approached my car and asked what I would like, I told him the Grizzly wash with the the jasmine air freshener.
His reply was okay it will be an hour and a half, which I replied no that will not work for me.
Again, there was NO misunderstanding! 👎🏻</review>

{'time': 1562454065195, 'text': "My apologies, Michael. When I asked my employees, to the best of our recollection, you wanted a detail and not a car wash. Sorry about any misunderstanding, but a car wash only takes about 30 to 45 minutes because we are a full service, 100% hand wash; not your average brush based express wash where car moves quickly because only machines work on your car. At any given time, there are seven or more people that take care of your car and there is a minimum time required to do it properly. Never will it take 1.5 hour to wash a car. Only details, carpet shampoo, hand wax, etc., will take that long. I hope there was not a misunderstanding. Please come back and see Mike. You'll see the speed and quality that we are trying to achieve. :-)"}< /Response>

Best place to take your vehicle specially high end vehicles and once with spoilers. Handwash and scrubbed then your car goes through a brushless tunnel with powerful water sprayers.  Clear windows throughout the wash cyle so that you can view the process from the AC waiting area. Once it is done washing, an attendant takes your car out of the tunnel and details it depending on which wash you bought. This place will give your car a showroom shine, polite and friendly staff.< /Review>

Spoke to the “owner” today and he told me their prices they have listed are not the prices they go by and since they are under “new management” they haven’t listed their new prices, however they have been in business since the beginning of April. Needless to say they are scamming and up charging all vehicles that come through. They should clean up their business ethnics and customer service or it might be under “new management” soon enough. Horrible service wouldn’t recommend to anyone.< /review>

<Resp>{'time': 1561931421184, 'text': "Mr. Harman,\nThe new ownership has been in business since the end of May. We were closed from late April through late May, for an entire month, undergoing construction and renovation. Through this phase, we poured new foundation, leveled out much of the cement and concrete for our cars, widened the track spacing to better accomodate larger tires (like the tires on your Lifted Dodge RAM 2500)...etc. If you came to this business in April, then you might have our business confused with the previous ownership.\nI'm sorry to hear you had a poor experience at our business. However, the sign states Interior Vinyl/Leather Dressing is 12.99 *and up.* Each vehicle requires a tailored approach when it comes to our detail services. Leather conditioning on a full leather interior (door panels, dashboard, seats, center compartment...etc.) on a lifted RAM 2500 is $20.00. I encourage you to come back and try our wash and interior conditioning services. We encourage our customers to understand the maintainance process of caring for their cars, and will answer any questions you might have about washing, detailing, maintaining, and protecting your car for the upcoming years."}</Resp>< gmapID>

< Review>
I purchased a $75.00 gift card. When I went to the establishment to use it was told it was from the previous owner.  I asked to speak with the owner and he was out. I spoke with the owner "Tom" later (vis phone) and he said he would honor it. I went in to use it and they wouldn't take it as the owner was out. I left my number,  never received a call back. I spoke with another guy there who said to come in.  I went there again,  he was out to lunch. I left my contact info again but never received a call back from him.  I called and they said to bring the card in so they could make a copy of it for the owner.  Once again,  I drove there, they made a copy, took my contact info and you guessed it,  I never received a call back.  Plain and simple,
they don't care.  For $75.00, they lost this customer indefinitely. I can see why they have only a 2 star rating.<//Review>

<text>This carwash is great. Employees are always friendly and do a good job. If they miss something, point it out to them and they will fix it. Everyone wants the car to look good when it leaves.  If it is an issue that requires management assistance, they are available to help. If you've never been there; try them out. If you took your car in before and were not satisfied, I encourage you to try it again.<//text>< Date>

Have taken my BMW here twice and each time they had to apologize and offer me a free car wash. Even the next car wash was free they gave me another free one because that one was so bad. I told them "I brought me car here so you could do it better than I would do, not worse". Worst car wash in town! Also had them chip a friends car and now they also will now not go back. If you have people you really don't like send them here.< /Text>

I have had excellent service everytime I have taken any of my cars for wash, detail or tune-up.  They are very thorough, hard working,  friendly to, not only me, but also my kids and my friends. Great business!! I have been coming here since they opened and had the first Mercedes Benz go through their wash.  Now I own a Jaguar and I trust no other car wash in town to do my car... or any of my cars! Prices are good in comparison, but even if I pay less, usually I get less and I am frustrated.  They are a great value all around.<//review>

Tried using their hand wash / hand wax service on our aging Honda Civic.  The detailer did an excellent job of cleaning the car inside and out.  The hand waxing and polishing work was outstanding - all done at very Reasonable Pricing - Thanks!</Review>

< Review>
Received a mailer coupon for $12.99 for basic wash,
interior wipe down and vacuum. I figured it'd be around $15-$20 since a have a van. Came in at 8am when they said they're open, but nobody was there and doors are locked. I asked the Jiffy Lube manager next door if he knew what time they opened. He said they're supposed to open at 8am, but they kinda just show up when they feel like it. He pointed out at the gentleman smoking on planter out front (whom i'd walked by previously), and said thats the manager of the car wash. I walked over, politely introduced myself and showed him the coupon that I'd received in the mail. He abruptly said "vans start at $48.99 for a basic wash". I mentioned the coupon said $12.99 ,and that I understood it would be a bit more for the van, but $50 is almost 4x's the amount advertised. He said "best I can do is $30." So, I said "no Thank you". He said "whatever man." Not to mention it was now 8:15am, doors were locked, and he was the only person there. I'm honestly not sure how this place is still in business.<//Review>

<Text>This place used to be very nice. It is now so dirty with huge stains all over the waiting room carpet not to mention it was 112 outside and 90 degrees inside the building! They had 1 guy washing and drying each car. He did an okay job considering how hot it was.
Previously I was turned away twice because my vehicle "was too dirty" (I live on a dirt road so of course I have to get my car washed often) I hadn't been back sense until this visit and it just confirmed that I will continue to drive farther to get a better experience.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><date>1498608229561<//date>< Rate>

Went today, they took an hour on our car. Assistant manager started yelling at his staff at his own fault. Trying to cover his own ass for things he didn't do. Didn't even lift up the seats in our car to vacuum them. Didn't even finish the car as we had other plans. Got no compensation for the poorly done job on our car and will not be returning.< /review>

Took the car there for a nice wash and detail. Everything was great until I noticed the seatbelt was stuck in the door to the point where I could not open it. Called to speak to the manager and after I had to call repeatedly for days, I finally got him on the phone. Dezi was extremely rude and hung up on me. Even though my voice was calm, he continued to yell and repeat himself and talk over me. I just wanted some help with fixing my door and maybe explore some options but all I got was rude customer service. So I called back and he refused to speak to me so he put another female "manager" on the phone. She was also rude and hung up on me. Terrible service and extremely condescending employees. I am disgusted.<//Text>

I visited the car wash today and had to pay $3.00 more than a few days ago.  The "manager" told me they don't make money at the price quoted earlier.  The receipt required extra effort for him to charge the additional amount since the price was clearly shown on the receipt.  I guess the new ownership will be making things worse.  Maybe it's time to go back to Elsinore.  You'd think repeat customers would be important with all the small businesses we see closing up.  Watch for "Bait and Switch" here.< /review>

<review>The guy who asked me what I wanted (assuming the manager). I told him i wanted just a basic wash. He said my car was too low to go into the wash machine (which i haven't had issues at other car washes). I figured it would be safer than sorry to not put it thru the machine So he said it would be 20.99 but He actually charged me 29.99? I figure if im going to pay extra they dont miss any dirt spots (they did), didnt dry my windows with air gun (like normal) & didnt wipe my dash down like they were suppossed to do in the package. I suggest rather going to a better place that might be cheaper for better service & a more welcoming atmosphere.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>Not very happy. Fiest time using these guys was Nov 21. I went for a car wash because they're in my area. My fault, I ended up paying for a pre-paid detail as well because I figured I'd need one pretty soon anyways. So I get my car wash on nov 21. Overall it was ok, I didn't really expect too much, it was just like. $15 car wash. The staff was nice, so it was an ok job. Well I schedule my detail for today January 11th. I go in, staff is nice, I'm expecting to wait at least two hours (time I was quoted over the phone by Brian.) getting w $100 detail done from a $15 car wash, I'm expecting my car to look magnificent, excellent best I've ever seen, since it's my first detail. I only end up waiting about an hour and a half (which I wasn't mad about, cool they got done sooner) I walk outside with the guy who actually detailed my car, I walk around the car to take a look, I notice some black marks (not scratches) but maybe product from the wash cloth or something I start wiping it off, then I notice dirt around where the body of the car meets the very bottom of the car (by the tires) all four spots by all four tires are the same material and color (white) as the car so I expected that dirt to be gone. Then I get inside the car and notice dirt and whatnot between the crease of my emergency brake. The foot rest wasn't cleaned, doesn't look like the matts were moved to be vacuumed underneath. The inside of the doors weren't cleaned (where you think some people wouldn't even look because you can't see it if the door is closed, but a detailer should get every little DETAIL).. The windshield had waterspots and white product on the window. I think they actually did a better job with a $15 car wash than a $100 detail. Either way, not happy with the end results, I still tipped the guy $20 because I did see him working hard on the car, just didn't quite meet detailing standards ( in my eyes anyways) and I probably most likely won't be back. I'd rather just pay BMW to detail my car. Trial and error. That's all.< /review><Time>1452555241071< /Time><Pics>None< /Pics>< username>

<review>HORRIBLE!!!!!!.... dropped me car off... went to go eat and after 1 hour my truck isn't even coming through the tunnel......went  to the managers and he started arguing with me saying "we wash by hand." instead of getting more guys to help or help himself he offered me $3.00 off....a bunch of misfits without any leadership or structure......the only reason i gave them one star is because i had to put something..... this place sucks!!!!!!</review>< Pictures>

Went there this weekend with my truck they didnt even wash out the bed. Then inside looked like they didnt even vacume out the seats. Then took porsche today and they forgot to wash one rim. And didnt wash the windows really well. Think ill go to california oaks next. Im not a picky person either, i dont walk around and inspect. I just expect it to be done somewhat decent. And not get home or get in my truck and feel like they did a lazy job. Im none confrontational. So on to the next car wash thats hungry.< /text>

<review>Just terrible.  They took over an hour to do a regular car wash for me on more than one occasion.  So much for giving them the benefit of the doubt.  The employees are nice, but the service is horrendous!</review><user_id>107130732946851118594</user_id>< GmapID>

For the amount of time they take, your car still doesn't get clean. You watch them as they miss spots during the drive-thru exterior wash. You watch as they wipe down your car over and over and over again and still leave streaks and smudges and bugs and whatever else. Tried this place a few different times with a few different vehicles, same result each time.< /Text>

Took my Tahoe with brand new tires and rims to get a wash and one of my tires and rims came back with huge gashes and scratches i know the manager noticed it and decided not to say anything. Very disappointed in this place. The wash itself was also awful. Water spots everywhere and the inside wasn't vaccumed well.<//Text>< response>

Spent $35.00 for car wash they broke my transponder and did a sloppy job on inside. My dash and doors started turning white with a spray pattern I went back and was told they only use water that's BS I saw them spraying stuff. DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!<//review>

Went for a Sunday morning wash on my BMW SUV, ordered what I thought would be a $19.99 wash, went to pay the bill and they had tagged another $2.00 on as a truck /SUV charge.This is a ridiculous charge #1 and #2 they do not show this as an additional cost.I was told this is a new charge and our customers have to get used to it.I informed them it would be the last time they would see me and it did not seem to phase them.......<//review>

I've been here multiple times now, and loved it! If you like a tea-heavy flavor, this is a great place! Although they tend to have a long line, I think it's worth the wait and the line usually moves pretty quickly. The owner is also well known for making sure that the drink tastes to your liking! I usually get the Rising Phoenix Milk Tea and the Gyokuro Green Milk Tea, and both are great drinks :)</Review>

Quite possibly one of the best bubble tea places.  Actually, this place transcends bubble tea.  While most other places have teas that taste like nothing more than sugar water, this place takes their teas seriously...you can actually TASTE the tea.  With knowledgeable and friendly staff, you can learn more about their teas and their process.  I highly recommend this gem.  There is usually a line but don't let that deter you, it is worth the wait!< /text>

Great service. Have come here twice and each time, the person handing drinks to each customer asked if they are willing to taste it to ensure they were satisfied with their order. I was given a warning that the full sweet Thai tea is actually really sweet. The person that handled my drink ensured me they would be willing to make it less sweet if needed. It's the small things that make a good experience become a great one.< /text>

This place is AMAZING!!  The staff are very kind and helpful and the tea is fresh and tastes magnificent! We can change it whenever we want and if we are trying a new tea, they say to wait and see if it’s perfect! It’s a little pricey, but its totally worth it!  I highly recommend.<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>Finally tried this place and it did not disappoint! Exceptional customer service and if it’s your first time there, they encourage you to try what you ordered before you leave, to make sure it’s to your satisfaction. I had Rising Phoenix, level 2 sweetness, regular ice, large size. It’s not often that I get impressed with milk tea (either tea is too sugary or too milky or bitterly strong etc.) but Orobae hits the right spot. My first sip and the flavor and aroma of Oolong hit my senses right way. Subtle, smooth and textured in flavor, just the way I like it. I went around 3:30PM on a weekday and there was already a line. Worth the wait though.</Review>< pics>

Best milk tea anywhere (judging off of rising phoenix and black jade).  The line is always long so be prepared for a wait.  It's also definitely on the pricey side.< /text>

outdoor ordering and pick up setting for covid pandemic. line was super long even before the shop opened. also they didn’t have the rising phoenix which was a bummer. they said because the shipment of leaves they got from taiwan “didn’t meet their quality requirements.” still sad but overall the tea was good and bobas tasty.<//Text>

Yum!  My favorite is Rising Phoenix with boba. I usually get level 2 sweetness on a scale of 1-5 and that is good enough for me.  The bobas are soft & chewy with the perfect sweetness.  You can really taste a great tea flavor in their Rising Phoenix - not just milk & sugar in many other boba places that you can't even taste the tea most of the time.  Orobae is probably my favorite boba place in Irvine.<//Review>

This place was CRAZY busy and we had to wait about 30 minutes in the rain, but it was worth it!

It is more along the lines of the Corner Bakery where you order at the counter and then sit down with your number card.

I ordered the chocolate waffle and it was amazing.< /review>

When I went, the lines were really long, so we were super excited. Turns out, it was way over hyped. The tea flavor was so weak, and everything tasted watery. Boba was chewy and nice hence the two stars, but it wasn't anything special compared to any other shop.<//Text>

YOOOOOOOOO. So I finally got to try some of this on a lucky day FIRST TIME EVER! Yes, there is always a line, but there are days when you can get lucky with no line! I got the rising phoenix oolong milk tea, half ice, #4 sweetness and it was perrrrrfect! I love their motto about making adjustments to your drink! I also got a thai tea which was amazing! They freshly brew your drinks and the flavor is amazing! I love the no ice option too! The two at the front were super amazing too! I think one was the owner? Definitely going back for more!!<//text>

<review>Having been here multiple times since they first opened, I can confidently say that this is among the best boba shops in Irvine. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait, but it's nothing too long. Staff are also extremely friendly, and really go out of their way to ensure that you are satisfied with your experience. Ordering experiences pre-pandemic and during the pandemic have also been great.

The drinks here have never let me down. High-quality tea paired up with boba pearls with amazing texture and flavor justify the price, no matter which drink I've ordered.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Always a great place to get fantastic drinks. During these pandemic times just have your drinks in mind so you can order quickly and the lines will be faster. It's only those who wait till the last minute to decide what to drink that makes the wait longer.</text>

<Review>The Raising Phoenix Oolong tea is the best. Great tea and boba is always perfect, not too hard, not too soft. I like how their quality is very consistent! I have to ask for less ice at almost every other boba places, but Orobae's normal ice level is just right. If you ask for less ice, your drink might be a little warmer than you expect.</Review><date>1608018827793< /date>< pictures>

The owner is really into his tea. It's fun to hear him talk about his teas and how he gets all of it and how he then breaks down the tea to do his brewing. Some of the teas he stops serving until he gets the flavor he is looking for just right.< /Text>

The owners and workers spray down before entering the store and check temperatures, good on the owners and the workers diligence.  Always get their phoenix milk tea with boba half sweet. Worth waiting for and trying other flavors too.<//Text>< pictures>

The texture of the boba is on point; definitely the best I’ve had in Irvine. Tea is authentic and flavorful. Only complaint is the high price point. I got a large drink with boba and the total was close to $7, which is a lot. I can’t say I’ll go back all the time, but I’m glad to have found a place with the perfect boba texture.<//text>

Probably the best tea in the area. As a lay person, it feels like each of their teas is more dynamic than the offerings at the typical boba shop. The defining feature here is the ability of the person handling the orders to describe and explain all the different flavors on offer. That level of service makes it feel like a premium experience. Echos of Portland in the food culture here. The boba is fresh to the point of being warm. Not overly sweet though. It's a bit more pricey than the typical boba shop but it feels like you're getting that proportionate premium experience.

Biggest downsides would be the reliable line. They work through it pretty quickly but there is a wait. It's also important to dial in your sweetness. Fortunately they're generous about reworking the drink i you don't like it. Rising pheonix is great. The Honey Gyuro is my current jam. Red jade is a bit more subtle than Omomo's offering and I prefer this version.< /Text>

This place is hands down the most authentic for the depth in flavor of milk bubble tea! I can't get over the taste! I recommend the Roasted Oolong or Rising Phoenix at half sweetness.

Customer service is phenomenal, Covid procedures being taken, lineups can take up to 10 mins but totally worth the wait 👌🏼< /review>

this was my unsweetened rising phoenix.  I was really surprised he how strong the tea was and will definitely be coming back to try their osmanthus oolong and other teas sans milk.  I'm truthfully not a boba fan but tried some of my boyfriend's and found it to be the best boba I've had.  ⠀
⠀
My boyfriend had his at half sweetened but I still felt it was pretty sweet for me. I also bought their gyokuro milk tea to save for tomorrow, but I'm pretty excited for it.  Customer service was amazing and tea was great!<//Text>

<review>Really high quality tea and boba, the owner couple has lots of knowledge about their tea and are very welcoming. My favorite is the Rising Phoenix milk tea, it tastes really similar to the the milk tea in Chun shui tang in Taichung, who is the OG of boba tea. This will be our go to boba place in Irvine.</review>< pics>

<Review>Best roasted oolong milk tea I've ever had. Their milk teas taste very high quality in general. The Boba is also sweet, but not too sweet and texture is perfectly chewy. They do take a while to make the drinks so be prepared to wait 20+ mins after you order.< /Review>< Pics>

There have been A LOT of boba places opening in Irvine lately but, this place excels when it comes to the strength of the tea used. They brew the tea fresh for each cup which helps with the quality of the tea. Their rising Phoenix (oolong milk tea) and gyokuro Green milk tea are amazing. I went with a 3/5 sweetness for both. I take my drinks on the less sweet side so if you like it more sweet definitely go with a full sweet drink.</Text>

<review>If i had a choice i would give no stars to this location. Representation is everything!!!! Especially when i comes to customer service. I come in to this location and stand in line for 5 minutes without be acknowledged with a simple, Hello welcome i will be right with you. Keep in mind I'm the only customer in line waiting to order. When i finally placed my order and received my smoothie, the employee there was rude and had a bad attitude. No employee should reflect their negativity on the company's Customers. I highly recommend this location to have Customers Service training.

Now i see why i this location is always empty<//review>< Pics>

Great service. Location is clean and staffed with super friendly people, they are very informative as well. Quick service on a Saturday. Bathrooms are closed and a big jug of hand sanitizer by the register. Got the strawberry surf and orange dream machine both made well 🙂👍< /text>

<Text>I can’t understand the reviews at this place, I’ve never received anything but good service at this place. I love talking health with the employees and their drinks and smoothies are always super delicious.

In this visit I decided to give them a review for all of their good service.< /Text>< Pictures>

The time is 1:46 September 2nd I walked into the Jamba juice on magnolia by lowes there was about five people waiting for their drinks and I asked if everybody was in line and they said no so I waited my turn just as I was about to walk up to the counter and place my order a lady walks in the door right in front of me and just cuts me I tried to tell the lady at the counter that it was my turn but she ignored me and just started taking the other ladies order now I only had 10 minutes call the other people in line already and then one more in front of me that cut I was not going to be able to make my bus so being frustrated I walked out the door and I opened the door forcefully I'm not sure if it was bad mosquito medication but there needs to be a better system to let people know that you're standing in line standing six feet away from everybody makes it confusing cuz nobody knows who's in line and who's waiting for their order. And you never answer the phone I tried calling several times<//review>

I don't have time to kill on my lunch hour. So I'm never coming back.
Bad, slow service.
So, it took 42 minutes to get 3 drinks. I'm so glad that the owner, has responded with the same response he's given to every complaint. How about I'm not going to your web site. How about you hire and train more people.</text><date>1521760277143</date><username>David E Torres< /username>< Rate>

<UserId.>101006560136079580568<//UserId.><text>I ordered a drink and it was disgusting. I do not live near the store so I called and told them the situation and she told me to call back in the morning to talk to her manager so that I can get a refund. I called and talked to the manager he said yes come in with your receipt my name is Andrew and I'll get you a refund. I came in a few days later with my receipt and instead of giving me a refund he offered to make me a new drink. He said he had to talk to it in order to get my refund and it will take like 10 days. so instead of going through all the drama of course I just took the other drink and left but I'm not satisfied with the experience whatsoever and I will never be back to this drama juice.<//text><Date>1522352541006< /Date></record></dataset><record>

Great food but likely not to come back. Staff got "special permission" to accept a $100 bill
(All I had) after they fretted for a good 5 mins (even though the have a counterfeit detector pen and determined it was real), then when the guy got the approval he had a $20 in his drawer and at least $60 worth of 5s. Increased of simply borrowing the rest of what he needed from the register next to him and putting it back after his next sale or two (that was way to confusing for him and stressed him out big time) I finally said forget it. I'll take my money and my business elsewhere.</Review>

Stopped going to this location because I moved away from the area. But today was my 2nd trip to Mall area location in about 2 months. One question; Why are the homeless attracted here?
Last time I visited, a homeless woman was bathing in the bathroom. She was finishing up her bird bath and forgot to lock the door, I unknowingly walked in on her. After witnessing that, I no longer needed to use the restroom.
Today there was an OVERLOADED cart parked outside the front door and a homeless man inside the "diningroom".
I came very close to driving off, after accessing the whole scene.

This area seems sketchy. Or perhaps it's sketchier than before. I won't be going back for the reasons stated above. Good luck Jamba Juice!

Update:
Hey Jamba Juice, sorry but no need for me to go to another site to give more info on my experience. I feel I've been thru enough @your store.<//Text>

< Review>
Ever since Rosie and Shona left I have been going this site is not for me and my friends anymore.  The only one there that knows what to do is Nicole and she is still new.  I've been lied to (Not by Nicole)...called in an order, was put on hold, and when I got there I was told they "ran out of Milk" and tried to call me back....which they didn't.  Waste of time.  Too many NEW people.  Looking for another place to go close by and will take all my work friends with me.  They are out of things alot now....just doing down hill.<//Review>

One of my drinks where way to watered down and it took 25 mins just to come out and server claimed my first order was stolen. Definitely not coming back here again.<//text>

I’m so upset. My drink is flavorless it literally tastes like ice! There was like 15 mins before closing so I’m sure they didn’t care how they made it.< /Review>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Excellent all you can eat sushi!!! From the poke to the sashimi to the hand rolls to the premium rolls it was all great! They also have all you can drink beer and sake for like $13 so I couldn't think of a better place to go out with friends for great food and drinks as a pre game for whatever. Right now they are offering a special for $1 pint of Sapporo. When we went they weren't offering any Uni because of the weather affecting the availability which honestly to me is a good sign because it means they use fresh ingredients. They also charge extra for changing up the roles in some cases for example we paid extra to get cream cheese added and some other things subtracted from some roles but they did make accommodations.< /text>< Pictures>

Mediocre ayce sushi. Fish and appetizers were good. Shrimp was not so fresh. Service was a bit slow. They have 1 dollar beer promotion going on. Overall was a nice experience to dine here.<//Review>

<Rating>3</Rating><text>All you can eat sushi and ramen who can beat that. They have the best ramen broth hands down. Sushi was alright. But the service not so great. Every time we go their there’s always something wrong with the server and the bill. They need to work on the service more.
It’s very nice and romantic for outdoor dining and indoor. You must come here at 5pm though or else you will be waiting in lines for hours. The indoor seating is limited.
If only the service was good and price I would come back here again for the food. It’s not bad flavor but just a little bit too expensive for two people. We paid $89 just for two people and a infant. Infant didn’t count.
If you going to order ramen don’t get too much sushi if you can’t finished or they will charge extra.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOzBoGV0Cx6eiM-fupRqypZpKUR6N0Ux-Iq3P0Y=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNwxVAvRuOQcvTFJVPIBMxdppSs7QHn7KeAOH6K=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0BBErfnQRVfxEZUSuz5_xX2eWjxhqNgQex9FX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOHG90r1TR7qfuiIiC17XVj-R91b8mhEUtKDyJn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMnzHYa6zTlYVQL40P15i4XZVGFOiYRKbQRJy1f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80dd2d80a987bc4b:0x778471637bff7b1d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

They finally open for dine-in and we absolutely loved their food! Their AYCE lunch is $24.99 and dinner is $28.99 They have other premium items during dinner that they don't have for lunch and we've gone both times and I think it's worth it. Would come back again!< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>After 3pm you must have $30 all you can eat per person. Didn't even tell them if we'd be ordering sushi. So even if you want ramen or something else, just $30 min. to eat there.
Also they wouldn't seat a person without everyone being present. So forget waiting to meet anyone.
Also have the parking lot blocked off but you'll get towed if you go to the next parking lot over.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I'm not a big fan of sushi so the food was ok. The waiter/server Daniel was so patient and polite with me and my family because it was our first time at the restaurant. I was kind of taken aback by the prices, but it's all good. It was a new experience. I would recommend this place if you like sushi.</Review>< Pics>

And that there was nothing they can do. They told me to just order more food. I'm a pretty petite woman. I cant eat more than 1 roll. I would get sick. I was very upset I had to pay that much for one roll. I dont reccomend this place for that reason. And the roll wasn't that great either.< /text><Gmap_id>0x80dd2d80a987bc4b:0x778471637bff7b1d< /Gmap_id>< Resp>

Good service!  They do take health precautions very serious here such as take your temp. If eating there outside.  Take out is pretty fast.  I recommend calling in the order so it is ready when you get there.  Parking may be an issue if it gets crowded.  I guess you can park in the businesses next door if you have to park somewhere.< /Text>

<rating>2<//rating><review>I just left this place and am quite dissappointed. The place looks nice so I am giving it two stars but I was denied any type of food options because of how close it was to closing (10pm).  (I got to the place around 9:20pm.

I saw food coming out non-stop so I am surprised they didn't want my business.

It was very packed inside and out and I will point out that it seemed very unlikely they were following COVID-19 protocols.  The dining area outside had about two rows of 6 tables each - with each table having a group of about 4 people with what looked like less than 6 feet between each table.

Inside there was a whole bunch of people too.  I doubt either inside or out were adhering to the 25% capacity rules but I will let you all judge for yourselves, don't take what I am saying as fact as it is simply my initial observation (before I was not given any options to eat - and damn I was hungry!) .  I hope you have a better experience than I did.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Aburi has a great selection of sushi at an affordable price. This was my first visit and I chose the Pacific roll for the gluten-friendly option (skip the sauce that comes with it - at this time, it isn’t gluten-friendly). The rest of my group had the Tiger roll, Philadelphia roll, and Rainbow roll. We loved all of it! The sushi rice was flavorful and just sweet enough to complement the sashimi. The take-away included two wasabi and two ginger containers for five rolls so ask for more if you are a huge fan of either. The online ordering through the PostMates plug-in was super easy. Even though we are still under COVID restrictions, the restaurant was busy when we picked up the order. We will definitely return!<//text>< Resp>

The absolute worse sushi AYCE I've ever had.

Spent 30 minutes waiting for the first round, was then told it'll be made first priority which came 10 minutes later.

At the same time the owner's friend's table was getting new dishes every 5 minutes or so.

Fish was tasteless and not fresh. If you're ordering anything but salmon prepared to be disappointed.

In all honesty pick any other AYCE sushi joint aside from this one. Only come to this one is you're already in the "in-crowd".<//Text>

The new location is huge compared to the size of the old long beach location. Food was fantastic and the quality we've been used to! The long beach location sorta trended downwards when it got sold.<//Review>

Ordered some sushi and bentos to go. I know it's their soft opening but it was very hard to order by phone. Wish there was easier online ordering. For their bento, the beef yakiniku looks like beef teriyaki. It tasted overcooked and hard to chew. Their sesame chicken looks like chicken karaage. It tasted good and very tender. Salad comes with two gyoza which was awesome. Overall bento was good but miso soup was too salty. Sushi and rolls...I think Sake2Me is still better in terms of freshness, taste, and texture. I would definitely come back to Aburi for non sushi stuff.<//Text>

Very nice staff!! Haemi (our server) was very friendly and polite. She even took the time to explained the food. The food also tasted fresh and delicious. Decent size of outdoor seating. I will return due to the friendly staff. Thank you Haemi.< /Text>

<review>This is high end sushi and rolls! It tastes like authentic japanese food. The presentation was spot on. The portion is bite sized. The fish quality is not A+ but I'd give it an A. I was impressed by the dynamite roll it had scallops and mushrooms. I enjoyed how the sushi rice was not too sweet. And the price is cheap compared to other japanese restaurants. My new favorite togo restaurant!</review>< Pictures>

<Text>Well I always have my issues with "ACE" Sushi restaurants. This has been my second one in about 2 months. The staff here are super quick at bring out your order which is great, until there is no room on the table and they keep bringing it! 🤔 Sloooow it down, let people enjoy the food. You start finding yourself shoving things down your throat just so you can get a plate off the table before they bring another. Saying that everyone enjoyed their food, everything we ordered was finished, even the all you can drink saki for $9.00. If you go early, before 12pm you will get parking, after 2pm forget it, it packed.< /Text><date>1621820655177<//date>< user_id>

<text>(Translated by Google) I went because the sushi was more delicious than other places, but the ordering process is complicated. Lots and not enough parking lot. Wait 50 minutes to eat.
The time to eat was limited to two hours, and the food came out too late, so I was tired and still hungry even though I ordered it for the first time. When I ordered the second time, before the sushi came out, the working person recommended tempura and ate it, but I was full and couldn't eat much. I don't think I ate it because I think I'm too wasteful of the money, and I don't feel very good the whole time I get home.

스시가  다른곳보다 맛있다고 해서 갔는데..주문과정이 복잡함..all you can it 은 맞지만 한번씩 오더 할때마다 제한이 되어있고 음식이 나오는것도 다른데보다 넘 늦게 나옴.주말도 아니고 월요일에 갔는데도 사람도 많고.파킹랏도 부족함. 50분을 기다려서 먹음.
먹는 시간이 2시간 제한되어 있고 음식이 너무 늦게 나오니 지치기도 하고 처음 오더 해서먹었는데도 배가 계속 고팠음. 2번째 오더할때 스시 나오기전에 일 하는분이 튀김을 권해서 먹었더니 배가 금방 불러서 음식을 많이 못먹고 나왔음. 돈이 너무 아깝다는 생각이 들고 먹은것 같지도 않고 집에 오는 내내 기분이 별로 좋지않음.</text>< gmapID>

(Translated by Google) It's all-you-can-it, but the quality is good. The amount of rice is small and the sashimi is fresh. Among the most recently visited restaurants, this is the best value for money.

올유캔잇이지만 퀄리티 좋음. 밥 양은 적고 회는 싱싱합니다. 최근 방문한 음식점중 가성비가 가장 좋은 곳입니다.</review>

The team arrived on time, told us of what would be involved and how long it would take, and then after installation walked us through how to operate our remote and fireplace. We’re really pleased with how nice it looks and look forward to using it in the cold weather! Really nice people from quote to installation, thank you.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808f98aaca86f23d:0x203351b7993447d1<//GmapID></record>

<Text>When our gas fireplace insert stopped working, I checked both Yelp and Google for repair places.  By far, Mister Chimney/Nova had the best reviews.  We dropped by, scheduled a time and when the service person came out, he found that the original vents had shifted and were no longer venting properly.  They had to reschedule for a later day because two people were needed to replace the vent.  They came, fixed it, thoroughly cleaned and tested the unit (about ten years old) and it works fine.  The gentlemen were friendly, clean and did a great job.  The price was very reasonable.  I highly recommend them.</Text><userid>102991565454162226608< /userid><Response>None</Response>< Pictures>

< review>
We used Nova for our very old fireplace gas insert(think 20+ years old). They fixed it in January, but sadly it stopped working again about a month later. I emailed  them and they were very quick to respond, courteous and helpful. It turned out some parts had given out and needed replacing. They only charged us for parts and not the repeat service, when they came to fix it the final time. José was the technician that came out the last time and did an excellent job. Everything is working great again and our fireplace insert works like new.
They do a great job respecting the house and cleaning up, as well as friendly service.
I appreciate their dedication to getting it right for a fair price<//review>

We tried to buy a fireplace insert from Nova fireplaces but they didn't seem interested in the business.  They have a great range and things started off well with a very professional site visit, but then we went into the showroom.  They were complaining how busy they were and then we were ghosted when we asked for the final quote.  Despite email follow ups we got no replies so had to go somewhere else and start the process again.< /Text>

NOVA technicians determined the problem and solution and installed a new gas valve. It took a couple of visits, but they persisted until the system was working properly again.  The technicians were COVID safe, prompt, courteous, and methodical.  I would recommend and certainly work with them again.< /text>< pics>

Excellent customer service, transparent pricing, and quality workmanship. I called Mister Chimney for a regular chimney inspection and sweep. The inspection revealed substantial damage that required rebuilding the firebox and relining the chimney to make it safe for use. They didn't push for the work and offered a rate that beat all other quotes. The team showed up on time and completely the work in a day. We've had no issues since.</review>

I ended up also using them to repair my chimney.  The repair work was to insert a liner to my chimney.  There were 3 guys who came to perform the liner work: Martin was the lead and accompanied by Jerado and Adrian.  They arrived on time and worked as a team very efficiently.  Martin also took some pictures from the fireplace chamber after the liner was put in to assure me that the liner is safe in place and sealed.  All in all, I'm very pleased and satisfied with their service.  Their price was very competitive and reasonable.  The crew kept my place clean and are very efficient, experienced and skillful.  The back office (person answering the phone, Fatima) responded my phone call very promptly and courteous. From what I had experienced, this is a very well-managed company.  I highly recommend this company for chimney work.< /review></record>

Martín was early for the appointment but it was OK because I was expecting him. He was prompt and clean.A fter inspecting, he warned me that wood burning is unsafe (which I anticipated but he confirmed it) and he suggested double-burning gas logs because of the size of my fireplace.
I'm awaiting Kevin to decide what kind of gas fireplace I'd like to use.<//review>

<time>1510355917244< /time><review>I manage a large apartment complex in San Leandro. We've been dealing with Fatima at Mister Chimney for the better part of a year now. They came out and did inspections and cleanings on all 129 units at our complex. They also replaced the side walls and did some other work in all of the fireplaces needing repairs. The active owner of the property requires a lot of detail and had tons of questions/comments/changes/suggestions however Fatima was always helpful, friendly, and patient. They did great work on a big job that we were told by a couple of other companies wasn't even feasible. Finally, Fatima stood her ground when our employer wanted to cut corners and not do certain things that they had suggested -- she would not certify safety on something that didn't have what she knew was required for safety. Integrity is a very important aspect in a business like this -- these are peoples homes and lives. I would highly recommend Mister Chimney.< /review><pics>None< /pics><user>107220841543566733064<//user><username>slrc2600 slrc2600< /username>< rating>

Based on their very strong Yelp reviews, we used Mister Chimney to replace our old, unstable brick chimney with one that is up to building code based on class-A pipe.

On the plus side, Martin gave us excellent customer service, and the work seemed to be of very high quality.  I'm a picky customer and I was pleased with all aspects of the work.

On the minus side, we had this work done with permits and inspections, and when the job was complete Martin lost the permit document.  We spoke on the phone and he agreed to try to get a copy from the city, but then I never heard back in spite of repeated attempts to get in touch.<//text>

<text>BEWARE: Company provides a "discount" for positive Yelp reviews

Hired them for a routine chimney cleaning.  Guy showed up on time and was friendly enough.  After he left, I found black fingerprints all over our wall, our white front door and doorknobs, and a pile of soot in the driveway.  After a couple hours, there was a fine layer of soot covering everything in our house.  I called the company and let them know there was a layer of soot on the furniture and everything else in the house.  Lady put me on hold immediately, then told me the chimney cleaner would be back to investigate.  One he showed up, I showed him the layer, which he wiped off with his finger and said "I don't see anything."  He asked what I wanted, and I explained that I wanted him to clean it.  He then used my cleaning products to partially wipe down one room and left. He did admit that it was quite dirty and his vacuum backed up in the house.

He also mentioned that our chimney was broken at the roof line and needed to be fixed asap.  He said he could not give an estimate but their office would right away because it would fall through the roof in an earthquake.  Just got the quote...3 weeks later.<//text>< GmapID>

Horrible experience. Do not hire these people. My fireplace is Travis Industries 3615 HO GSR2. For starters the owner Martin came out to put together a list of venting materials needed that was incorrect. Next the installer, Gerardo, did not know how to read the directions & although I asked in advance, did not know how to install my brand. He cut a hole through the wall of my house in the wrong place & that had to be patched. He than tried to cut a vertical support in the wall instead of elbowing the vent around it. Then he dumped the entire box of cracked glass onto the firebed in spite of 1/2 the amount directed because of optional log set. He also left the template in place under the cracked glass bed, that should have been removed after the log set support brackets were placed. The metal template plus too much glass on the firebed did not allow the fireplace to breath.  I walked into the room that evening to find the pilot flame shooting up 1.5 feet above the firebed. I shut the gas off. It was a nightmare. I had to thoroughly read the directions & work with Gerardo to make sure it was done correctly. I later found Steve of American Chimney to come out & clean the soot off the inside of the fireplace & install a high wind shield over the exterior vent. I wish I had known about him for the original installation. Yes I paid Mr. Chimney in full. I would recommend you never hire them.< /review>

<Text>The best breakfast I have found since I have arrived here. I love trying new things and this spot caught my eye while I was out walking and decided I would stop by on my day off. Oh my goodness...the best idea I had on that day. Well today was the day I stopped by in the early morning hours. The lady making my food was super nice and patient with me. I'm trying out a version of the keto diet and its working for me but difficult to stay on track on vacation. Well this young lady made it super easy. She helped me with figuring out the sausage patty situation. Soooo instead of the patty she had small round sausage bites is what I call it and I got that for my everything burrito. I don't remember the name but it had sausage bacon eggs cheese and veggies...i.added guac to it also. Remember i said keto...lol. I got it without the wrap and she was sooo helpful and sweet and didn't hesitate to make sure I was getting what I wanted. That right there is what I call OUTSTANDING customer service. I will definitely visit in the future to try one of those massive sandwiches. A perfect morning! Oh
..if you are looking for some good guacamole...this is the place to go....so fresh...so good.<//Text><gmap_id>0x80deacca285e5195:0xe670bf455965143b<//gmap_id>< Name>

Great spot to swing by for sandwiches before the beach. The deli counter is small, but it's worth the wait.< /text>

Buyer beware, prices are marked up 1,700%. Yes, 1,700%, you read that right. Shop somewhere else if you don’t want to be overcharged. When I asked if the price was correct the cashier flipped out on me and said to leave his store.< /review>

<rating>1<//rating><review>Came here once and gave the clerk my North Carolina drivers license as a form of ID. He told me it was fake, he couldn't verify my identity, and that if I ever came back he would call the police. Have heard similar stories from other people who have gone here with out of state IDs. Don't give this place your business-- there are several other liquor stores on the island that I've used my out-of-state ID at with no issues. If they actually gave an effort to serve people with non-California IDs then I'd consider going back.< /review>< pics>

look carefully for some hard to find whiskies. while the prices are accelerated due to the type of store (small), and mostly location, the selection is most appropriate for whiskies to get your fix and needs taken care of. The gentleman behind the counter was very helpful and kind.< /review>

This place really is special. Family-owned and run for many years and you can taste in the quality and the care the family puts in to ensure their customers have great, quality food. I could go on and on about the food and service but, in-short, this is one of the best Chinese food restaurants I have ever attended. They also offer a number of Korean dishes and soups. Price-point, food quality and service are second to none.<//Review>

And the grand store makes the food taste much better. Heck some LA ones are not even good as Fulin maybe I am being too picky or the lunch special is just too cheap to expect something great.
Try Shin Won in rowland heights if you want more korean style authentic chinese food much better quality if you enjoy chinese cuisine.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c333d4df20709f:0xcf5fe486af2b76cf< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The food here is delicious, plentiful, and at a low price, especially the lunch specials.  Everything is fresh, flavorful, and of high quality. Just keep in mind, eat in the restaurant, do not order take-out because the food is made by different chefs. The dine-in food is made by the master chef while the take-out is made by the trainee, and not nearly as good and always too salty.</text>

My family & I have been coming to this restaurant for over 15 yrs & it’s the best Chinese restaurant hands down. The food is amazing & the owner is very friendly. My kids never say no if I suggest Fu Lin for dinner. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//text>

Old classic Korean-Chinese restaurant that's been open for over 20 years. The entrees there are excellent, and I'd say this is the some of the best jjajangmyeon you can get in the area. In fact, the jjajangmyeon, a staple of Korean-Chinese cuisine, is better than that of quite established Koreatown places such as The Dragon. In other words, that's kind of a big deal. That just hints at how well done the food is here.

The main competitor that I know of in the IE with similar cuisine is China Point, and Fu Lin blows it out of the water in both entrees and noodles.<//Review>

<Text>Food was hot and delicious. Service was excellent, server was pleasant spoke English and checked on us just the right amount. We got the individual complete dinner which gets you the soup of the day, egg rolls paper wrapped chicken(which is actually wrapped in tin foil) and a fried wonton then you can pick from a good assortment of entrees, I got Mongolian beef and my wife got sweet and sour chicken it also comes with your choice of steamed rice or fried rice we got one of each. Overall the food,service and pricing was fantastic.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

This restaurant is one of my favorite places for dining out, and it never disappoints me.
For most of Chinese food lovers, Fulin is an absolute must try out restaurant not only for great taste & excellent prices, but also for the impressive service.<//Review>

<review>The food and service were terrible all around. The waiter was practically throwing plates and glasses at us, almost like we insulted them just by walking in the door. The meal was flavorless at best. Never been to a Chinese restaurant where the cook never used spices or heard of flavor. Do yourself a favor and go to the next place.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Amazing selection of Americanized Chinese food, it also includes a few Korean dishes. Haven't had Chinese food this good since I worked at Jade Court in 90's in Youngstown Ohio. This place is legit, inexpensive and has all the dishes you've come to love.</Text>

Noodles are good and jjajangmyun had some seafood which will kick ur appetite. Tangsooyuk was okay but very reasonable price overall. Yakima dumpling was bit disappointment but still jjajangmyun was 4 stars!<//Review>

< review>
Fu-Lin is a restaurant that offers both fast food quality Americanized Chinese food and Koreanized Chinese food such as Jja Jang Myun and Jjam Bbong.

I have tried both types of food and I really found it below average food. The food is often too salty and too oily.

However my dad likes their Gan-Jja-Jang, which is the stir fried Jja Jang Myun here. I am not a fan of it and I do not recommend it.</review>

The service is always horrible. Hispanic waiter is always rude to my mother and I every time we've gone. Not once do they check on us or offer water refills. Anytime we ask questions about the menu waiter is always snobby. Sucks, this is a place I grew up going to.< /text>

I used to go here all the time and get lunch for the crew, not soi much now but am going today, their lunch specials are a super value, they use good ingredients with no filler type  stuff as sat these " chinese fast food"places.The head waitresss is always so nice and cordial and take out no tipping required. . .I'll usually get four orders and vary them as lunch is required over the years to feed this bunch. kung pao is superior,garlic chicken is superior,mongolian beef is superior, shrimp with lobster sauce is superior,if you must have the chow mein and chop suey, but other things I cant think of are better choices.Basically this is the only chinese restraunt I go to after having found it superior in every aspect to all the otherr local offerings of  the same range and convenience. fulin  is not fulin you.but fi lin yu<//text>

<review>They do very good with pedicures. But since the pandemic and they opened back up they take on more customers then they can handle and it’s not a lot of workers working .. so they tell ppl to come in and have them waiting for a while..< /review>< Pictures>

The person who did my nails did not assure the glue to not stick to my skin right after glueing the fake nail until later after already filled my nails and filing it. A few small parts of nail was not properly filled with the wet powder. There was a bit of liquid powder dried on two of my cuticle. There’s a few other minor things too but I won’t go into it. The person could have done a better job but that’s okay. The person was nice and accepted me as walk in. The person tried to complete the set as close to what I want. Also, that person took off $5 of the original price that the person told me it would cost. So I was thankful for that.</text>

One technician spent my time showing pictures of her kid and texting. She totally did my toes messy and did not file them straight.

It’s hard to find a good nail spot. I’ve had absolutely horrible experiences so I’m always afraid to try new spots. When I first walked in they greeted me right away even though they were super busy. Wait was about 15 minutes but not bad at all. The place is super clean and employees are really friendly. TONS of colors to choose from. Im on week three of my nails and they still look like when I first got them. Can’t wait to get a fill. If you haven’t I would totally check them out.< /text>

I was not impressed. My nails did not come out right and the lady that worked on them said they were fine I will not come back here. The color changed to a dark tone the day after and the gel looks like it was melted
There are blotches of paint missing I am not happy. Never again< /Text>

I was told you have to wait 20 minutes which I understand I do if you dont have any apt. But I waited for an hour and finally got seated. Then the lady that was supposed to do my nail roamed around and chatted with her co workers. I finally got up and told the receptionist I’m leaving because of such a long wait and incorrect information.< /Review>

<Review>My first time there. The salon is beautiful inside. I was greeted when I came in. The lady was very nice who did my nails. She did a great job and trust me Im very picky. I would definitely recommend giving them a try. Im looking forward to going there again with my daughters.<//Review>< pics>

<review>Unprofessional and horrible customer service. My gf and her younger sister went here to get their nails filled today and the lady working on her younger sister straight up ignored what she wanted to do when she didnt like the shape AND would slap her hands when she moved. All while on FaceTime. Do not go here!< /review>< Time>

<review>I do not recommend this place at all!!  Horrible!  We had appointments and still waited quite awhile. They barely did anything and charged way too much!  $30 for pedicure and $25 for manicure. The manicure consisted of her pretending to trim the cuticles and soaking my hands in way too hot paraffin wax. Then she didn’t even paint my nails because she said it would make the cuticles too dry. That would have been fine if she hadn’t charged me $25!  What a rip off!  The pedicure was not much better.  It was supposed to include callous remover but they barely even scrubbed our feet with a super soft brush then rubbed a tiny amount of scrub on a few spots of the legs. Then she half heartedly rubbed the legs for a few minutes-Not even the whole leg, just a few areas here and there. Then painted the toes and done. Barely lasted 15-20 minutes.< /review>< Rate>

On June 16 our church sanctuary wing in  Yucca Valley completely flooded (pastor’s study, 2 anterooms, sanctuary -112 person capacity- foyer, mother’s room and 2 bathrooms).  In areas of the sanctuary itself there was an inch plus of standing water.
I called a businessman friend in Redlands and he recommended Padgett’s Fire and Flood Restoration.  I called and talked to Wyatt Padgett who came up immediately to assess and evaluate, talked to our insurance to get things moving, and had a company to do hazmat testing on site that day so that we could be ready to remove drywall and insulation. He also had a crew there early on to do emergency water extraction and set up 40 + heater fans for about a week to dry out carpet, pews, etc. They had to remove 2 feet of drywall and insulation throughout the whole wing, there were areas that were challenging because this facility is 54 years old.
We found Padgett’s to be an awesome company to work with. They were there on time when they said they would be, got the job done in good time, were professional, great workers that did not leave a mess behind, communicative with us as to what they were doing and with our insurance company as to what needed to be done. Wyatt Padgett was on site multiple times to check on his crew and we felt that we were charged appropriately for the work that was done!
We would highly recommend them to anyone!</Text>

We didn’t know who to call so we called our insurance Co and they called Padgett’s for emergency restoration service. Although our insurance co wouldn’t cover it because of the mold so we panicked, the Padgett’s Restoration Service was sympathetic, great, professional and gave us advice and helped us out a lot. So yes I would highly recommend them.

<review>Padgettes services are all around amazing.
They packed up our belongings and stored them on our property, removed and installed the floors, rebuilt kitchen cabinets, installed a new countertop and installed our sink. Every employee was so nice and helpful. Given there was different people for each part of our restoration, I never had an issue with anything or anyone. Fast and reliable!<//review>< rate>

My experience was amazing from the emergency trip to the completed repair/remodel.  They were always there to assist with everything including the insurance adjuster, furniture, even helping to choose the paint and flooring colors.  They hold your hand through this stressful time.  The entire team was so helpful and professional.  Debbie Cowan and team handle moving everything and with the personal property report including detailed pictures.  John Motts guided the claim with the inspector and claim adjuster and also selected the colors that worked perfectly in my house.  MIke Delcid ran to construction and kept the job moving and ahead on schedule.  He’s a perfectionist with all aspects of the job so my home looks better than I could have imagined.
The incredible team made a very difficult situation so much better.
Great team !  Could not of ask fir anything more< /review>

We had water damage in our living room & hallway.  We used another company for the water damage cleanup as I did not know about Padgett’s at the time.  So glad I found Padgett’s to give me an estimate for the repairs. They were professional & much more comprehensive.  Good workmanship. I’m happy I had them repair the water damage.<//Review>

I was concerned about a possible mold issue in my bathroom. I contacted Wyatt and let him know my concerns and within a timely manner he was there to inspect the area. After talking with him about what he had found, he was very thorough, helpful and informative regarding what my options would be from that point. He was very honest, not looking to make a quick buck off someone who just didn’t know what to expect. Honesty goes a long way with me. I’d highly recommend him and would happily use this company if the unexpected happens to occur in my home (knock on wood).</Review>

The professionals at Padgett’s were quick and responsive when we had a master bath water leak that caused our wood floors to start to buckle along water soaked dry wall. They quickly began the drying out process and identified the areas where moisture had penetrated. The damage was minimal because of their quick and speedy response. Having a fire and/or flood is so unsettling and disruptive. Padgett’s took so much stress off of us so we could live our lives as normal as possible. Thanks you Padgett’s for being on our team of professionals that help to restore our house back to normal. Without hesitation or reservation, I highly recommend this company to anyone who has a fire or flood disaster.</Text>

<review>We didn’t end up using Padgett’s this time, because they were honest in their evaluation of what we really needed. We used them a few years ago for a remodel. Their employees arrived exactly when they said they would and were professional at all times! Especially during Covid this time, he wore a mask without question and that made me feel really good and respected. We really appreciated their advice! Highly recommend.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Had a roof leak due to the rains back in April. Padgett's was called out by our Insurance Company and they arrived immediately.  Our experience from start to finish was more than I expected. I was drawn to this company as they are not only a family owned business, but the years they have been in the industry. Their employees were respectful of my property, friendly and very professional.  They never rushed to just get the job done and their attention to detail was impressive. I would not hesitate in recommending this company. Thank you again!< /text>

From the first phone call to the last inspection this company by far exceeded any expectations we could have imagined!  The customer service is five star!  The employees are kind, respectful and communicate what is to happen.  This was very important and a big relief to be able to trust the workers and the quality of the work.  Do not hesitate to use this company!<//Text>

I cannot say enough about Padgett's and their staff.  Making an otherwise horrible experience into a rather manageable situation.  Beyond professional and attentive to your needs and concerns.  Their follow through amazed me, they were always on time, went out of their way to access my needs and provided an overall exceptional experience.  Everyone I worked with on their team was great!  Melvyn in particular really provided the support we needed, going over and beyond expectations, helping us step by step.  As a long time home owner, with years of dealing with contractors, and having experienced other home misfortunes I can say that I will never go to someone else in the future.  These guys rock!<//Text>

< Review>
I had a very pleasant experience with Wyatt, a representative of Padgett's Fire & Flood Restoration.  He arrived in a very timely manner and seemed genuinely concerned with my situation.  He was very professional, knowledgeable, and well spoken. If Wyatt is any indication of the personnel that are employed by his company, then I would highly recommend them. Unfortunately, my insurance company did not cover my claim, so I  had to use alternative means to resolve my problem. I can not comment on the quality of their work, since I  did not use their services.< /Review>

<Review>Back in December, my house had water damage due to a leaky roof, windows, and stucco! All that rain we had was just streaming down the inside of my living room walls behind the fascia and the drywall. My only clue that something was wrong was when I discovered wet carpet.  It's taken 6 months to find the source of all these leaks and get everything repaired. Padgett's was there for me in the beginning during the drying-out phase with their dehumidifiers, fans, etc. Once all the leaks were secure and repairs were done to the outside of my house, Padgett's repaired the inside for me. They did drywall, paint, carpet, and whatever else was needed.  My living room looks beautiful!!! Thank you to Branden, Matt, Luis (and Luis), Chris, and all the Padgett's family for helping me in my time of need!! I highly recommend Padgett's!! Not only do they do excellent work, but they were nice, friendly, trustworthy, and a pleasure to work with in my house!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Name>KELLY GORDON</Name><UserId.>111634966194909004280< /UserId.><date>1562190494987< /date></record></dataset><record>

9 years ago we had a serious “grey water” flood and the people at Padgett took care of the whole process with such professionalism that I am still impressed.  First remove all contaminated floors and walls, then dry, then sanitize, then reconstruction.  Every subcontractor came when promised and I was kept in the loop during the whole process.
When they were gone we couldn’t see any repairs, all looked new.
More recently we had a minor water leak and the adjustor arrived within 1 hour.  It turned out we didn’t need their service but I was still pleasantly impressed with the response and advise.

I recently had a slab leak, and was given options by my homeowner's insurance of places to use to make the necessary repairs. Unfortunately, Padgett's wasn't on that list, however I had been following them on Instagram and was well aware of their high ratings from others that have used them. I notified my insurance I'd be using them and away they went. The folks over at Padgett's stayed in contact with me throughout the entire process. There was never a time when I didn't know what was happening or when they'd be at my house. Everything was clearly explained to me along the way and the repairs were made in a timely fashion. From Wyatt, to Matt, and the countless other folks along the way, thank you for the work you guys put in at my house. The floors and new baseboard look great! Go with Padgett's!</text>

We chose Padgetts to restore our mountain cabin that suffered water damage. During insurance claim it was discovered that in addition to water damage we would need removal of hazardous asbestos material, requiring the complete removal of the sub floor.

So, our restoration included laying a new subfloor, then carpet, bathroom tile and woodwork in all the rooms affected.
From our first conversations, through the entire procedure, we were so glad to have chosen Padgett's. They are extremely accommodating, reliable and professional. We cannot say enough regarding their service.  and recommend them without hesitation.

I found Padgett’s fire & flood restoration on Instagram. I saw that It was a local business, and I am huge on supporting local run businesses! So I decided to reach out on a Thursday evening and left a message. By first thing Friday morning my message was answered and an appointment to come out to my house was made! Wyatt was out to my house first thing Monday morning! I was concerned I could potentially had a huge mold problem. Wyatt was extremely patient and professional! He checked the whole house for my and put my mind at ease. From thinking my house might have been full of mold to only having a small wet spot in the upper wall from a leaky roof. He explained how and made suggestions on how to take care of the problem as well take the time to explain to me how mold comes about and thrives under certain conditions. I am beyond impressed with the my whole interaction with Padgetts! Should I ever need fire or flood restoration, Padgetts will be my first call! Thank you again Wyatt for you professionalisms!<//Text>

<text>What began as one of the worst days for our family ended with what can only be described as the Angels from Padgett's. On the early morning of March 6, 2017 I received that horrible call that my parents home had had a fire. They were both in route to the hospital and I was to meet the firemen at their house. What I saw was no less than shocking........ the smell permeated my nose, mouth and throat. Black soot was on and in everything throughout the house. This was what they call a "smoker".
We were almost immediately introduced to the awesome folks of Padgett's Fire and Flood Restoration through our insurance company. From that day forward we were treated like we were the only people in the world, each and every individual we met truly had a passion for what they did, which they all did very well. The house got all new paint, floors window treatments and light fixtures....... did I mention the house is 100 years old! We feel so very blessed and in one way will miss what feels like one big amazing family!!!!!!!! Thank you all Padgett's  Family and God Bless.< /text>< pictures>

We are repeat customers. Padgett's helped us a few years ago when 85% of our house flooded. So, when we had a problem with the water main on our front lawn, we asked them for a recommendation. Even though it had been two years, they were fast to respond to our request and suggested the plumber who helped us before. The plumber came out that day and fixed the problem in 2.5 hours. Special thanks to Mike from Padgetts and Jeff and colleague from Performance Plumbing & Rooter. Thank you so very much!</review>

< Review>
On Dec 7 2017 my parents were involved in the Lilac fire in Fallbrook. The neighborhood lost 65 homes in their community, but their home was spared.  However, due to their location they had major smoke and ember damage.  I called Padgett’s Cleaning and Restoration, Inc. and met with Tim. He gave me all the advice to get started.  His team met with our insurance adjuster and work started in a timely fashion. Their team did a great job with packing and documenting every item in the home.  They took all the items to their facility and washed and repacked and stored everything until all the repairs on the home were complete.  We had many repairs on the home and they were very thorough in their documentation to the insurance company to get my parent’s home back to its original condition. Their team did a great job in restoring the roof, windows, siding, fascia, carpet, painting in and out, metal carport, A/C, light fixtures, and masonry. After the repairs were complete, every item was brought back and moved into the home. The furniture and boxes were unloaded, unwrapped and put in their original spot in the home.  The team was very professional and detailed in all aspects of the project. Our family is very grateful to have Padgett’s there during this difficult time. Thank you!</Review>

I would recommend Padgett's for flood restoration.  It's a very unpleasant experience for anyone to have to endure; yet the different divisions from start to finish managed to make it as painless as physically possible.
Everyone was always very courteous and available when necessary.<//text>

< Review>
From the beginning when I first met Tim Padgett, I knew if our building ever needed restoration from a flood Padgetts would be our choice.  In June our water heater flooded our foyer restroom and I immediately contacted Padgett’s.  Padgett’s arrived on the scene to survey the damage, with Padgett’s on our team we all breathe easier from the beginning to the end.  Padgett’s kept us in the loop with time frames, calendars, etc.  All calls and concerns we're always addressed immediately.

If we should EVER have a incident again, Padgett’s is my go to company!  Thank you Padgett’s for our new restroom!

<Text>Padgett’s Fire and Flood Restoration (Padgett’s) was called out when we had a flood at our house on August 14, 2018. They came out and found that we had mold 4’ up on all our walls and underneath our lower kitchen cabinets. They crew contained the area while we got approval from the insurance to perform the emergency mold remediation and then Padgett’s scheduled the crews to perform the remediation and received a clearance the first time being tested.

Even though we had issues with getting my insurance company to corporate and approve a estimate at the end of the day after I had to battle with my adjuster Padgett’s estimate was  ultimately the estimate I finally got approved after 3 months. Padgett’s wrote the correct estimate the first time but my adjuster felt we should just patch things and not do it right but Padgett’s was right there by my side when I needed to meet with the insurance company and at the end of the day there correct estimate was approved.

Padgett’s was part of the team that help me get our home put back together and all of the crews did an amazing job and performed there work timely and correctly the first time.

I would 100% recommend Padgett’s to do any type of work in your home.</Text>< Pictures>

We rarely write reviews but if anyone deserves positive feedback it’s definitely Padgett’s!  Our experience working with Padgett’s was more than what we expected. They were highly professional, met all our expectations and went above and beyond to ensure quality work making sure all deadlines were met. Every email or text we sent to either Wyatt, Mike, or Debbie were responded to immediately addressing all our questions and concerns.

The mitigation crew were extremely quick to provide restoration services and were attentive to fine details.  Within a couple of hours of the flooding, the crew were already at our house before the crack of dawn gutting the floors and punching holes in our baseboards to prevent mold buildup.  It was heart wrenching to watch but necessary.  We appreciate how they shared how the process would go. My husband and I both work while juggling a one and three year old, and Padgett’s was always willing to meet us on “our time” with our busy schedules.

After the mitigation crew were done with their part, the contents crew came in and took over. We feared that there be would be no way all our valuables could possibly be counted for but we were happily surprised to be wrong! Even the ginger from the refrigerator were taken account for by Debbie and her team. This ensured much needed confidence when psychologically we were not at our best. They took inventory for every item, packed the salvageable items in clean padded boxes and stored them securely in their wearhouse.

Mike, the general contractor, oversaw the repairs after mitigation and contents. He was extremely knowledgeable, experienced  in his role and accurate with all his recommendations.  Additionally, he made sure everything was thorough and the job was done correctly. There were some hiccups along the way because of miscommunication when we decided to go with another contractor for flooring but that was all mended out later. It was a learning process for us that if you hire multiple contractors who don’t communicate with each other, things will not always be seamless.

Overall, we think one of the best qualities of Padgett’s is their responsiveness and communication. They were always available by telephone, email, and/or text messages almost any part of the day. We definitely didn’t have that “corporate” feel where our questions were addressed by automated messages on the other end. You always had that sense of comfort knowing that it’s a family owned business with accountability. We are very fortunate to have worked with Padgett’s!<//Text>

We cannot say enough good about the Padgett's team!! We had a sewage flood and within hours of calling Padgett's, they had a team out ripping up contaminated flooring and starting the drying out process.  Through our State Farm Home Owners Insurance, we were placed into their Premier Service Plan (PSP), through which Padgett's is a vendor... and have been so pleased.  Tera in the office has been working day in and day out on our claim, making sure the proper vendors are contacted and keeping everything in line. Their contents team was so efficient and careful in packing up our things during the pack out.  Each team that they have sent, be it from the claims dept, to the construction dept... all have been fabulous. They have done such a great job in keeping us updated as to how our house is coming along.  Everyone that we have dealt with at Padgett's has been super kind and caring in this not fun time. I seriously cannot say it enough Padgett's has been the best company to have on our side, going to bat for us, and doing a stellar job on our behalf.  You will not be disappointed with choosing them, especially if you use them through State Farm's PSP.< /Text>

Called Padgett's early Friday morning and the woman who answered the phone said she would have someone call me back that day. She ended up calling back and saying Tie would call after the Holiday Wednesday morning. I have a flooded house and when I got no return phone call the girl that answered the phone said too bad. This company was referred to me by State Farm and got to say if I didn't return my calls I would be out of business. I am letting State Farm know that this company really doesn't care about helping people at the worst times. I would never use this company because if they can't return a call to set up an estimate who knows how they would handle my home.<//text>

I will extremely recommend Padgetts to any one that has any type of water or fire damage. My husband and I had a water problem dude to the refrigerator water and ice line bursting. The water damaged the kitchen, dining room, family room, formal living room and garage. I called the company close to closing hours and where willing to come in that same day after I got out of work around 10 PM. To me that is a big plus because most companies I called will tell me I had to wait until the next bussiness day. During the cleaning  process of ripping off my walls, removing my wooden floors, dealing with mold and lead testing and gutting our whole kitchen. They made it supper stress free. Wyatt and his crew always kept me inform with what was happening. They will go above and beyond to make sure our baby in the house and dogs where not expose to the chimials or machines that they where using. Over all I am happy with great work they did. And will use them again if I run into any trouble again.<//Text>

I was referred to use Padgett's through my insurance company, Nationwide. Despite of the fact that Padgetts is approximately over 40 miles from  the City of Chino I took a big risk in agreeing  to use them. From the first day  when I discovered the molds in my guest's bathroom , till the day the job that was completed by Padgetts, I was very Impressed by the quality of their work and the professionalism of all their employees who worked on this project.  They were all prompt daily,  and never complained  about the driving distance; were all polite and courteous . Before the work began, they told me that the project would involve two phases,  Phase 1 , the cleanup  or tear down of the affected bathroom.  Phase 2 was the construction phase and they told me that I can use any contractors I want to complete the job.  Because of the excellent work I had received from Padgetts during Phase 1, I had decided to give them another trail.  Soon at the onset of Phase 2,  I met with my assigned project manager, Chris Thomas.  Due  to my current disability and being on a fixed income,  I wouldn't  have been able to afford replacing the carpet in the master bedroom,  because  it wasn't covered by the insurance.  But, with  his experience, Chris suggested that he could applied the money that was approved by my insurance intended for the bathroom tiles to use it for the  master bedroom 's carpet since the tiles in the bathroom were still in great shape and can still be re- used.  I approved to change the carpet in the master bedroom, and now both rooms looks great.
In another instance,I  accidently cracked the glassed, mirror door with my scooter.Frantically, I called Chris to tell him.  To my suprise Chris said not to worry; it was their fault' that his man place it behind the door.  Subsequently, Chris replaced the mirror closet door at no charge.
As you can see, Padgett's management have the experience and Chris have both the experience and compassion in iradicating  the molds issue i originally had.Without any hesitation i highly recommend Padgetts to anyone  who has fire or water damage or any other source of damage requiring restoration to your business or residence.</text>

< Review>
Padgett's is the most dishonest and unprofessional company. If you are an inconsiderate person who hates your neighbors, Padgett's would be the company to use. We live right above a house they are rebuilding on a shared hill and the constant jack hammering caused a crack in our pool (half of our pool is exposed as it is notched into the hill as an infinity pool). I reached out to them to ask that they come take a look to reach a compromise solution at which point the project manager stated, "put what you want in writing, but we aren't going to pay to fix your pool."  His entire tone was arrogant, defensive, hostile and rude. Even with all of the evidence (I recorded video of my pool reverberating during their jack hammering - but they didn't care to see it), their response is that I'm wrong and the jack hammering couldn't have cracked my pool.  I've had contractors, pool engineers and even the neighbor's architect and state farm agent state that they thought it was caused by the jack hammering. I have an email stating this and yet with all of the evidence they still state that I'm wrong and I guess all of the other industry professionals. Only after my lawyer sent them a letter stating the jack hammering in Nov/December/April caused the crack did Padgett's respond with, "The information provided in your letter does not match to the dates that our work was performed" - COMPLETE LIES or their entire fleet of Padgett's branded trucks must have been stolen as their trucks were parked in our cul de sac during that time - I know this bc I was blocked in by them on multiple occasions.  So either they are liars or they have no idea where their workers are - both should be unacceptable.  I went down there twice to ask for the name of the project manager and both times I was told that they didn't know who was in charge!

Even if you disregard the cracked pool, they leave large debris in the cul de sac (a box has been in the middle of the road for 2 days and it's still there), they speed on our cul de sac even when I'm walking my baby in his stroller, they have blocked me in on multiple occasions stating that they can't find the people they need to move their trucks, and block the garbage trucks so that they can't pick up my garbage. They have NO regard for anyone else.

From the other review and mine, it seems as though their response for everything is that we are wrong and/or they have no record of it, but clearly that can't be the case every time an issue comes up even though I'm sure they will try.

Please be considerate to others and do NOT use Padgett's.< /Review>

On June 16 our church sanctuary wing in  Yucca Valley completely flooded (pastor’s study, 2 anterooms, sanctuary -112 person capacity- foyer, mother’s room and 2 bathrooms).  In areas of the sanctuary itself there was an inch plus of standing water.
I called a businessman friend in Redlands and he recommended Padgett’s Fire and Flood Restoration.  I called and talked to Wyatt Padgett who came up immediately to assess and evaluate, talked to our insurance to get things moving, and had a company to do hazmat testing on site that day so that we could be ready to remove drywall and insulation. He also had a crew there early on to do emergency water extraction and set up 40 + heater fans for about a week to dry out carpet, pews, etc. They had to remove 2 feet of drywall and insulation throughout the whole wing, there were areas that were challenging because this facility is 54 years old.
We found Padgett’s to be an awesome company to work with. They were there on time when they said they would be, got the job done in good time, were professional, great workers that did not leave a mess behind, communicative with us as to what they were doing and with our insurance company as to what needed to be done. Wyatt Padgett was on site multiple times to check on his crew and we felt that we were charged appropriately for the work that was done!
We would highly recommend them to anyone!<//review>

Padgett’s is a awesome restoration service. We had a flood in our garage from our hot water heater. We didn’t know who to call so we called our insurance Co and they called Padgett’s for emergency restoration service. Although our insurance co wouldn’t cover it because of the mold so we panicked, the Padgett’s Restoration Service was sympathetic, great, professional and gave us advice and helped us out a lot. So yes I would highly recommend them.

<review>Padgettes services are all around amazing.
They packed up our belongings and stored them on our property, removed and installed the floors, rebuilt kitchen cabinets, installed a new countertop and installed our sink. Every employee was so nice and helpful. Given there was different people for each part of our restoration, I never had an issue with anything or anyone. Fast and reliable!< /review></record></dataset><record>

My experience was amazing from the emergency trip to the completed repair/remodel.  They were always there to assist with everything including the insurance adjuster, furniture, even helping to choose the paint and flooring colors.  They hold your hand through this stressful time.  The entire team was so helpful and professional.  Debbie Cowan and team handle moving everything and with the personal property report including detailed pictures.  John Motts guided the claim with the inspector and claim adjuster and also selected the colors that worked perfectly in my house.  MIke Delcid ran to construction and kept the job moving and ahead on schedule.  He’s a perfectionist with all aspects of the job so my home looks better than I could have imagined.
The incredible team made a very difficult situation so much better.
Great team !  Could not of ask fir anything more</Text>

< Review>
We had water damage in our living room & hallway.  We used another company for the water damage cleanup as I did not know about Padgett’s at the time.  So glad I found Padgett’s to give me an estimate for the repairs. They were professional & much more comprehensive.  Good workmanship. I’m happy I had them repair the water damage.</Review>

I was concerned about a possible mold issue in my bathroom. I contacted Wyatt and let him know my concerns and within a timely manner he was there to inspect the area. After talking with him about what he had found, he was very thorough, helpful and informative regarding what my options would be from that point. He was very honest, not looking to make a quick buck off someone who just didn’t know what to expect. Honesty goes a long way with me. I’d highly recommend him and would happily use this company if the unexpected happens to occur in my home (knock on wood).<//review>

< Review>
The professionals at Padgett’s were quick and responsive when we had a master bath water leak that caused our wood floors to start to buckle along water soaked dry wall. They quickly began the drying out process and identified the areas where moisture had penetrated. The damage was minimal because of their quick and speedy response. Having a fire and/or flood is so unsettling and disruptive. Padgett’s took so much stress off of us so we could live our lives as normal as possible. Thanks you Padgett’s for being on our team of professionals that help to restore our house back to normal. Without hesitation or reservation, I highly recommend this company to anyone who has a fire or flood disaster.<//Review>

<review>Had a roof leak due to the rains back in April. Padgett's was called out by our Insurance Company and they arrived immediately.  Our experience from start to finish was more than I expected. I was drawn to this company as they are not only a family owned business, but the years they have been in the industry. Their employees were respectful of my property, friendly and very professional.  They never rushed to just get the job done and their attention to detail was impressive. I would not hesitate in recommending this company. Thank you again!< /review>< pictures>

I cannot say enough about Padgett's and their staff.  Making an otherwise horrible experience into a rather manageable situation.  Beyond professional and attentive to your needs and concerns.  Their follow through amazed me, they were always on time, went out of their way to access my needs and provided an overall exceptional experience.  Everyone I worked with on their team was great!  Melvyn in particular really provided the support we needed, going over and beyond expectations, helping us step by step.  As a long time home owner, with years of dealing with contractors, and having experienced other home misfortunes I can say that I will never go to someone else in the future.  These guys rock!<//Review>

I am a local Realtor and recommended Padgett’s Fire & Flood Restoration to my client who was going through the inspection process of their escrow. Wyatt was diligent, professional, thorough, and took his time to address our questions. If it wasn’t for the information provided by Wyatt Padgett, my client wouldn’t of proceeded on the home or saved thousands of dollars. I am very thankful for this company and look forward to working with them in the future!<//Review>

I had a very pleasant experience with Wyatt, a representative of Padgett's Fire & Flood Restoration.  He arrived in a very timely manner and seemed genuinely concerned with my situation.  He was very professional, knowledgeable, and well spoken. If Wyatt is any indication of the personnel that are employed by his company, then I would highly recommend them. Unfortunately, my insurance company did not cover my claim, so I  had to use alternative means to resolve my problem. I can not comment on the quality of their work, since I  did not use their services.</text>

<review>Back in December, my house had water damage due to a leaky roof, windows, and stucco! All that rain we had was just streaming down the inside of my living room walls behind the fascia and the drywall. My only clue that something was wrong was when I discovered wet carpet.  It's taken 6 months to find the source of all these leaks and get everything repaired. Padgett's was there for me in the beginning during the drying-out phase with their dehumidifiers, fans, etc. Once all the leaks were secure and repairs were done to the outside of my house, Padgett's repaired the inside for me. They did drywall, paint, carpet, and whatever else was needed.  My living room looks beautiful!!! Thank you to Branden, Matt, Luis (and Luis), Chris, and all the Padgett's family for helping me in my time of need!! I highly recommend Padgett's!! Not only do they do excellent work, but they were nice, friendly, trustworthy, and a pleasure to work with in my house!< /review>< Pictures>

<review>9 years ago we had a serious “grey water” flood and the people at Padgett took care of the whole process with such professionalism that I am still impressed.  First remove all contaminated floors and walls, then dry, then sanitize, then reconstruction.  Every subcontractor came when promised and I was kept in the loop during the whole process.
When they were gone we couldn’t see any repairs, all looked new.
More recently we had a minor water leak and the adjustor arrived within 1 hour.  It turned out we didn’t need their service but I was still pleasantly impressed with the response and advise.
Great Company, great people</review>< pictures>

I recently had a slab leak, and was given options by my homeowner's insurance of places to use to make the necessary repairs. Unfortunately, Padgett's wasn't on that list, however I had been following them on Instagram and was well aware of their high ratings from others that have used them. I notified my insurance I'd be using them and away they went. The folks over at Padgett's stayed in contact with me throughout the entire process. There was never a time when I didn't know what was happening or when they'd be at my house. Everything was clearly explained to me along the way and the repairs were made in a timely fashion. From Wyatt, to Matt, and the countless other folks along the way, thank you for the work you guys put in at my house. The floors and new baseboard look great! Go with Padgett's!<//review>

<Text>I had a very pleasant experience with Wyatt, a representative of Padgett's Fire & Flood Restoration.  He arrived in a very timely manner and seemed genuinely concerned with my situation.  He was very professional, knowledgeable, and well spoken. If Wyatt is any indication of the personnel that are employed by his company, then I would highly recommend them. Unfortunately, my insurance company did not cover my claim, so I  had to use alternative means to resolve my problem. I can not comment on the quality of their work, since I  did not use their services.< /Text></record>

I can’t say enough nice things about Padgett’s. I would definitely use them again and recommend them to others. They were polite, punctual and professional. Matt and Wyatt kept on top of my project and its completion to my satisfaction. 5-stars for sure.< /Text>

<user_id>104249284998223269155< /user_id><review>We chose Padgetts to restore our mountain cabin that suffered water damage. During insurance claim it was discovered that in addition to water damage we would need removal of hazardous asbestos material, requiring the complete removal of the sub floor.

So, our restoration included laying a new subfloor, then carpet, bathroom tile and woodwork in all the rooms affected.
From our first conversations, through the entire procedure, we were so glad to have chosen Padgett's. They are extremely accommodating, reliable and professional. We cannot say enough regarding their service.  and recommend them without hesitation.

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>9 years ago we had a serious “grey water” flood and the people at Padgett took care of the whole process with such professionalism that I am still impressed.  First remove all contaminated floors and walls, then dry, then sanitize, then reconstruction.  Every subcontractor came when promised and I was kept in the loop during the whole process.
When they were gone we couldn’t see any repairs, all looked new.
More recently we had a minor water leak and the adjustor arrived within 1 hour.  It turned out we didn’t need their service but I was still pleasantly impressed with the response and advise.

<review>I found Padgett’s fire & flood restoration on Instagram. I saw that It was a local business, and I am huge on supporting local run businesses! So I decided to reach out on a Thursday evening and left a message. By first thing Friday morning my message was answered and an appointment to come out to my house was made! Wyatt was out to my house first thing Monday morning! I was concerned I could potentially had a huge mold problem. Wyatt was extremely patient and professional! He checked the whole house for my and put my mind at ease. From thinking my house might have been full of mold to only having a small wet spot in the upper wall from a leaky roof. He explained how and made suggestions on how to take care of the problem as well take the time to explain to me how mold comes about and thrives under certain conditions. I am beyond impressed with the my whole interaction with Padgetts! Should I ever need fire or flood restoration, Padgetts will be my first call! Thank you again Wyatt for you professionalisms!<//review>< pics>

<Text>Karen & her crew removed everything from our house after the fire.  They catalogued each item and labeled it salvaged or total loss.  It made it so easy to file our claim with the insurance.  The items they salvaged were taken to Padgett's storage where they cleaned everything and boxed them. When they returned the items,  they unpacked them and placed them in the house so it looked beautiful when we returned. I know my words are not expressing my gratitude well enough.

<Text>What began as one of the worst days for our family ended with what can only be described as the Angels from Padgett's. On the early morning of March 6, 2017 I received that horrible call that my parents home had had a fire. They were both in route to the hospital and I was to meet the firemen at their house. What I saw was no less than shocking........ the smell permeated my nose, mouth and throat. Black soot was on and in everything throughout the house. This was what they call a "smoker".
We were almost immediately introduced to the awesome folks of Padgett's Fire and Flood Restoration through our insurance company. From that day forward we were treated like we were the only people in the world, each and every individual we met truly had a passion for what they did, which they all did very well. The house got all new paint, floors window treatments and light fixtures....... did I mention the house is 100 years old! We feel so very blessed and in one way will miss what feels like one big amazing family!!!!!!!! Thank you all Padgett's  Family and God Bless.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dcabad6981572b:0x1a1a11c216b6721d< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>We are repeat customers. Padgett's helped us a few years ago when 85% of our house flooded. So, when we had a problem with the water main on our front lawn, we asked them for a recommendation. Even though it had been two years, they were fast to respond to our request and suggested the plumber who helped us before. The plumber came out that day and fixed the problem in 2.5 hours. Special thanks to Mike from Padgetts and Jeff and colleague from Performance Plumbing & Rooter. Thank you so very much!< /text><userid>110822847948498409325</userid>< Time>

On Dec 7 2017 my parents were involved in the Lilac fire in Fallbrook. The neighborhood lost 65 homes in their community, but their home was spared.  However, due to their location they had major smoke and ember damage.  I called Padgett’s Cleaning and Restoration, Inc. and met with Tim. He gave me all the advice to get started.  His team met with our insurance adjuster and work started in a timely fashion. Their team did a great job with packing and documenting every item in the home.  They took all the items to their facility and washed and repacked and stored everything until all the repairs on the home were complete.  We had many repairs on the home and they were very thorough in their documentation to the insurance company to get my parent’s home back to its original condition. Their team did a great job in restoring the roof, windows, siding, fascia, carpet, painting in and out, metal carport, A/C, light fixtures, and masonry. After the repairs were complete, every item was brought back and moved into the home. The furniture and boxes were unloaded, unwrapped and put in their original spot in the home.  The team was very professional and detailed in all aspects of the project. Our family is very grateful to have Padgett’s there during this difficult time. Thank you!</Text>

I would recommend Padgett's for flood restoration.  It's a very unpleasant experience for anyone to have to endure; yet the different divisions from start to finish managed to make it as painless as physically possible.

From the beginning when I first met Tim Padgett, I knew if our building ever needed restoration from a flood Padgetts would be our choice.  In June our water heater flooded our foyer restroom and I immediately contacted Padgett’s.  Padgett’s arrived on the scene to survey the damage, with Padgett’s on our team we all breathe easier from the beginning to the end.  Padgett’s kept us in the loop with time frames, calendars, etc.  All calls and concerns we're always addressed immediately.

If we should EVER have a incident again, Padgett’s is my go to company!  Thank you Padgett’s for our new restroom!

Padgett’s Fire and Flood Restoration (Padgett’s) was called out when we had a flood at our house on August 14, 2018. They came out and found that we had mold 4’ up on all our walls and underneath our lower kitchen cabinets. They crew contained the area while we got approval from the insurance to perform the emergency mold remediation and then Padgett’s scheduled the crews to perform the remediation and received a clearance the first time being tested.

Even though we had issues with getting my insurance company to corporate and approve a estimate at the end of the day after I had to battle with my adjuster Padgett’s estimate was  ultimately the estimate I finally got approved after 3 months. Padgett’s wrote the correct estimate the first time but my adjuster felt we should just patch things and not do it right but Padgett’s was right there by my side when I needed to meet with the insurance company and at the end of the day there correct estimate was approved.

Padgett’s was part of the team that help me get our home put back together and all of the crews did an amazing job and performed there work timely and correctly the first time.

I would 100% recommend Padgett’s to do any type of work in your home.< /text>

Our experience working with Padgett’s was more than what we expected. They were highly professional, met all our expectations and went above and beyond to ensure quality work making sure all deadlines were met. Every email or text we sent to either Wyatt, Mike, or Debbie were responded to immediately addressing all our questions and concerns.

The mitigation crew were extremely quick to provide restoration services and were attentive to fine details.  Within a couple of hours of the flooding, the crew were already at our house before the crack of dawn gutting the floors and punching holes in our baseboards to prevent mold buildup.  It was heart wrenching to watch but necessary.  We appreciate how they shared how the process would go. My husband and I both work while juggling a one and three year old, and Padgett’s was always willing to meet us on “our time” with our busy schedules.

After the mitigation crew were done with their part, the contents crew came in and took over. We feared that there be would be no way all our valuables could possibly be counted for but we were happily surprised to be wrong! Even the ginger from the refrigerator were taken account for by Debbie and her team. This ensured much needed confidence when psychologically we were not at our best. They took inventory for every item, packed the salvageable items in clean padded boxes and stored them securely in their wearhouse.

Mike, the general contractor, oversaw the repairs after mitigation and contents. He was extremely knowledgeable, experienced  in his role and accurate with all his recommendations.  Additionally, he made sure everything was thorough and the job was done correctly. There were some hiccups along the way because of miscommunication when we decided to go with another contractor for flooring but that was all mended out later. It was a learning process for us that if you hire multiple contractors who don’t communicate with each other, things will not always be seamless.

Overall, we think one of the best qualities of Padgett’s is their responsiveness and communication. They were always available by telephone, email, and/or text messages almost any part of the day. We definitely didn’t have that “corporate” feel where our questions were addressed by automated messages on the other end. You always had that sense of comfort knowing that it’s a family owned business with accountability. We are very fortunate to have worked with Padgett’s!<//Review></record>

We cannot say enough good about the Padgett's team!! We had a sewage flood and within hours of calling Padgett's, they had a team out ripping up contaminated flooring and starting the drying out process.  Through our State Farm Home Owners Insurance, we were placed into their Premier Service Plan (PSP), through which Padgett's is a vendor... and have been so pleased.  Tera in the office has been working day in and day out on our claim, making sure the proper vendors are contacted and keeping everything in line. Their contents team was so efficient and careful in packing up our things during the pack out.  Each team that they have sent, be it from the claims dept, to the construction dept... all have been fabulous. They have done such a great job in keeping us updated as to how our house is coming along.  Everyone that we have dealt with at Padgett's has been super kind and caring in this not fun time. I seriously cannot say it enough Padgett's has been the best company to have on our side, going to bat for us, and doing a stellar job on our behalf.  You will not be disappointed with choosing them, especially if you use them through State Farm's PSP.< /Review>

Called Padgett's early Friday morning and the woman who answered the phone said she would have someone call me back that day. She ended up calling back and saying Tie would call after the Holiday Wednesday morning. I have a flooded house and when I got no return phone call the girl that answered the phone said too bad. This company was referred to me by State Farm and got to say if I didn't return my calls I would be out of business. I am letting State Farm know that this company really doesn't care about helping people at the worst times. I would never use this company because if they can't return a call to set up an estimate who knows how they would handle my home.</text>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>I will extremely recommend Padgetts to any one that has any type of water or fire damage. My husband and I had a water problem dude to the refrigerator water and ice line bursting. The water damaged the kitchen, dining room, family room, formal living room and garage. I called the company close to closing hours and where willing to come in that same day after I got out of work around 10 PM. To me that is a big plus because most companies I called will tell me I had to wait until the next bussiness day. During the cleaning  process of ripping off my walls, removing my wooden floors, dealing with mold and lead testing and gutting our whole kitchen. They made it supper stress free. Wyatt and his crew always kept me inform with what was happening. They will go above and beyond to make sure our baby in the house and dogs where not expose to the chimials or machines that they where using. Over all I am happy with great work they did. And will use them again if I run into any trouble again.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1540580671090, 'text': 'Thank you so much Joey! We appreciate the kind words.

<rating>5</rating><text>I was referred to use Padgett's through my insurance company, Nationwide. Despite of the fact that Padgetts is approximately over 40 miles from  the City of Chino I took a big risk in agreeing  to use them. From the first day  when I discovered the molds in my guest's bathroom , till the day the job that was completed by Padgetts, I was very Impressed by the quality of their work and the professionalism of all their employees who worked on this project.  They were all prompt daily,  and never complained  about the driving distance; were all polite and courteous . Before the work began, they told me that the project would involve two phases,  Phase 1 , the cleanup  or tear down of the affected bathroom.  Phase 2 was the construction phase and they told me that I can use any contractors I want to complete the job.  Because of the excellent work I had received from Padgetts during Phase 1, I had decided to give them another trail.  Soon at the onset of Phase 2,  I met with my assigned project manager, Chris Thomas.  Due  to my current disability and being on a fixed income,  I wouldn't  have been able to afford replacing the carpet in the master bedroom,  because  it wasn't covered by the insurance.  But, with  his experience, Chris suggested that he could applied the money that was approved by my insurance intended for the bathroom tiles to use it for the  master bedroom 's carpet since the tiles in the bathroom were still in great shape and can still be re- used.  I approved to change the carpet in the master bedroom, and now both rooms looks great.
In another instance,I  accidently cracked the glassed, mirror door with my scooter.Frantically, I called Chris to tell him.  To my suprise Chris said not to worry; it was their fault' that his man place it behind the door.  Subsequently, Chris replaced the mirror closet door at no charge.
As you can see, Padgett's management have the experience and Chris have both the experience and compassion in iradicating  the molds issue i originally had.Without any hesitation i highly recommend Padgetts to anyone  who has fire or water damage or any other source of damage requiring restoration to your business or residence.</text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>{'time': 1521476446968, 'text': 'We are happy that you gave us a chance to assist you and that we were able to work out the construction, so that the carpet in your master bedroom could be replaced.

<Review>Padgett's is the most dishonest and unprofessional company. If you are an inconsiderate person who hates your neighbors, Padgett's would be the company to use. We live right above a house they are rebuilding on a shared hill and the constant jack hammering caused a crack in our pool (half of our pool is exposed as it is notched into the hill as an infinity pool). I reached out to them to ask that they come take a look to reach a compromise solution at which point the project manager stated, "put what you want in writing, but we aren't going to pay to fix your pool."  His entire tone was arrogant, defensive, hostile and rude. Even with all of the evidence (I recorded video of my pool reverberating during their jack hammering - but they didn't care to see it), their response is that I'm wrong and the jack hammering couldn't have cracked my pool.  I've had contractors, pool engineers and even the neighbor's architect and state farm agent state that they thought it was caused by the jack hammering. I have an email stating this and yet with all of the evidence they still state that I'm wrong and I guess all of the other industry professionals. Only after my lawyer sent them a letter stating the jack hammering in Nov/December/April caused the crack did Padgett's respond with, "The information provided in your letter does not match to the dates that our work was performed" - COMPLETE LIES or their entire fleet of Padgett's branded trucks must have been stolen as their trucks were parked in our cul de sac during that time - I know this bc I was blocked in by them on multiple occasions.  So either they are liars or they have no idea where their workers are - both should be unacceptable.  I went down there twice to ask for the name of the project manager and both times I was told that they didn't know who was in charge!

Even if you disregard the cracked pool, they leave large debris in the cul de sac (a box has been in the middle of the road for 2 days and it's still there), they speed on our cul de sac even when I'm walking my baby in his stroller, they have blocked me in on multiple occasions stating that they can't find the people they need to move their trucks, and block the garbage trucks so that they can't pick up my garbage. They have NO regard for anyone else.

From the other review and mine, it seems as though their response for everything is that we are wrong and/or they have no record of it, but clearly that can't be the case every time an issue comes up even though I'm sure they will try.

Please be considerate to others and do NOT use Padgett's.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

This is important, call to order your food, ordering online it can get lost. I always get the drunken noodles with duck with mild heat. Absolutely insanely good! Great portion size and flavor for the cost. Good people running this restaurant, let's keep them running!< /review>

Might be the best Thai food I've ever had... Not that I've been to Thailand or anything, but it was fantastic.  I had a simple meal, panang curry with a side of Thai dumplings. I will definitely be going back for more</Review>

Service here is a little slow when I normally dine in, but the staff are very polite and attentive. The food here is also fantastic. Can definitely recommend the angel wings, the mee krob, the pad thai, the pad-see-u, the drunken noodles, duck over spinach, and the garlic pepper wings. Honestly, every time i've been here I have tried a new dish, and it has always been flavorful, filling, and delicious.

Definitely come here if you want good Thai food. Also, their mango iced tea is ridiculously sweet and delicious.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<review>***update: the food is now almost as bad as the service, and the service is seriously the worst I've ever gotten anywhere. Even to go orders are impossible to get in a reasonable time. What a shame.... someone needs to open a decent Thai place in the neighborhood. This place needs to go out of business. In honestly surprised it hasn't already.***

The food is almost always good,  and usually fantastic. We've been eating here for 12 years. The past 5 years or so, the service has been getting progressively worse. They really need more people on the floor: a hostess, a designated to-go order person, an extra server or 2 during rush hours...It's sad because we love the place. We still get take-out regularly,  but we won't dine in anymore. It's just too painful.< /review>< pics>

Pad See-U was good. Pad Tai was not very good. For being nearly empty, the service was terrible. Redeeming quality was the ambiance. We were very impressed with the decorations and atmosphere. Probably won't be coming back.<//Text>

The staff is not friendly. I asked a girl about the different noodles there are on the menu and she said " just look at the menu"...short and rude. Food is underwhelming, no plastic forks, napkins included in takeout..Shrimp was chewy cardboard, no seasoning on the chicken. Utterly disappointing</review>

I love this place! It's my go-to-place every time I crave Thai food. The food is delicious, the place is nice and the staff is friendly. Sometimes when they are busy, the service can be little bit on the slower side, but it is well worth the wait.</review>

< review>
I had the pineapple fried rice. It came in a scooped out pineapple. Very interesting way to display the plate. The Golden Triangles was our appetizer. They were crunchy, but not greasy and came with a very wonderful tasting sauce. One friend  had the red curry, the other had spicy Drunken noodles. Everything tasty and devoured. I would definitely recommend this place. Great friendly service too.</review>

A super find for delicious Thai Food in Poway.  Tucked in a small neighborhood stripmall; it's elegantly appointed, very clean and the wait staff is helpful and informed.  The food is delicious and they have great entree selection for lunch starting at $9.99. Best deal in town!<//Review>

Have been dining here for years. Penang Curry is the best I have tasted in the world. Thai Fried Rice is excellent as well. Owner is first generation That immigrant and it shows in the authenticity. Nice decor. Staff has been there for years which also gives a familiarity to it.<//review>

Pretty good but nothing impressive. Duck is a meat option for a lot of the dishes, which is unique. Appropriately sized portions for a normal appetite.</text>

The only downside really is the Pad Thai is so good here I simply do not enjoy Thai food from anywhere else. This is now my go-to home for great Thai food. For those wondering, the Beef Pad Thai extra spicy is a must try.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80dbfbc689be7f33:0x8a94df496b1da79c< /gmap_id></record>

Great Thai place for dinning in or taking out. I enjoy the spicy eggplant and my coworkers love their drunken noodles. They use to have more spice levels, but they are still good at mellowing down or spicing up a dish.</Review>

<Text>I noticed a significant difference in quality, it went from some place I have gone here with my family for years to somewhere I will not go again for a significant amount of time to see if anything has changed. They use plane white napkins instead of the cloth ones they used to, maybe they were an added expense so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. However this does not excuse poor service by the hostess/waitress and food of subpar quality. Long wait for drinks, food and to even take our order. I can excuse the food time because we came on a Tuesday and they were likely not prepared for the volume of food ordered but not the food's quality.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80dbfbc689be7f33:0x8a94df496b1da79c<//Gmap_id>< Rate>

It's just average tasting, yet a bit pricier than it should be for the quality you get. For the area it's a bit of the only option, so it will work in a pinch if I'm craving Thai for lunch since it's close by, but they don't open until 11 and as my lunch starts at 11 and they won't take orders ahead of time, they won't really get my business or anyone with the same lunch period who wants to get back to work in time.< /text>

I asked for mild spice. My husband asked for medium spice. His was probably the equivalent of mild and mine had no spice at all. The first time we came here we really enjoyed the service and the food. I can honestly say since then it has gone downhill and continues in that direction.<//Review>< time>

<rating>4< /rating><text>Ive been several times.. The food is REALLY Good but the staff not as friendly as one would hope - If they work on better communication and engaging is small conversation with patrons they will have it all. Maybe there is a language barrier that prevents them from being as friendly as accustomed to at other places? Again.. I really like the food...< /text>< username>

We ordered drunken noodles which was exchanged by another table and we did not get a replacement, where as the other table got one. They where not even crowded to mess up orders. Noodles where burnt and so was the chicken. Paid for bad service and bad food very disappointed with this place.</Review>

< Review>
Lived in San Diego for 16 years.  Takhrai Thai has, bar none, the best yellow curry & Pad Woon Sen.  Must be excellent wok hei in that kitchen to achieve such distinguished flavor in the Pad Woon Sen.  Would love to see how it's prepared & cooked as my own doesn't hold a candle to theirs!< /Review>

We enjoyed the food, service, and the decor from South of the Border was great! The margaritas were not made fresh. They were poured from a pitcher which may mean they were from a premixed bottle.? Anyway, everything else was 5***** minus one for the nasty margheritas.<//text>

We went yesterday for dinner with the family. The waitress was really sweet and we really liked her. But my husband was brought the wrong order and so was my son. The waitress had several tables and was doing the best she can so it took a few for her to come back to check on us. She realized my husbands plate was wrong and replaced it. My sons food was replaced some time later, so she did fix it. It just took a while.<//Text>

Our favorite Mexican restaurant in Atwater the food is great not super spicy so you’re not gonna leave that place with indigestion unless you order a specific meal that’s hot the portions are huge the service is stellar the establishment is big always clean sometimes the parking gets a little tight that’s my only complaint</text>

Food is good,,, but some time's it is hard to understand the waitresses and  they can be a little rude and pushy..

Food some time's comes out dry like the beans in the picture the chicken is a little dry too but the overall portions of the food is great...

For Mexican food in Atwater I would think this is the best place to eat at I would recommend it to anyone.

Typical pricing for a sit down dinner of four (4) will run you about $80 to $130...

Please like if this helped you Thank You...< /Text>

One of the best place with great ambience around Merced to have mexican delicacies. They have great whole fish fry and also a variety of mexican dishes to choose. Also they have combination menu where you can mix and match items which I like. You need to be early for dinner to have a seat comfortably without waiting in line for table. Call before you visit.< /Review>

<Text>Food is always excellent! But during this pandemic, your girls need help! And to be taught to utilize trips to tables. Ex, bring dirty dishes back on your way back to the kitchen. Bring drinks when going to check on customers or taking them their bill. Maybe get a hostess to help seat people and jot down peoples names. Seat them more together instead of spread apart. Come together, leave together type of flow. Just some suggestions from tonight's 2 hour experience. Your girls are amazing and are doing the best they can. We'll definitely be back, so we'll see you soon amigo!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><username>Melissa Kendrick<//username>< GmapID>

I took my mom here for her birthday. It wasn't  busy just 2 or 3 tables. The place is very beautiful. I ordered the chicken with mole. I liked the portion size but the mole tasted like the store bought Dona Maria's.<//Text>

I ordered take out.  Combo plate 2 Chicken enchiladas with green sauce.  Enjoyed it but was unable to finish it, so I have lunch for tomorrow.  Yeah!    I also ordered carrots after ensuring that they weren't spicy hot.  Which I was told they were not.  They did taste good but I would of liked them to have a little zing to them just not spicy hot.  I would still order them again.< /text>

<Text>Food was good but service was a little thin. Interior design is hand painted walls and artist who created the art was present working on her next project. Table seats are a bit uncomfortable.

<Date>1561169608326<//Date><rating>5</rating><Text>My fiance and I have been coming here for over three years and absolutely love the food. We have always had great service. Back in January my parents started talking about having a party for their 60th anniversary in June and we suggested Isabella's to have a more relaxed day. The owner, Rafael, was awesome to work with on booking the date, the food, and room set up. It was an absolutely fantastic day and Rafael worked with us on dishes for three of our guests that had special food needs. I highly recommend Isabella's Bar & Grill for dinner or a special occasion.</Text>< pictures>

Not satisfied,  food could be better.  I have given this place several attempts and it's just not good quality food. Nachos were awful its something like you put together at home as a quick fix, no flavor at all.  The crowd was good but need to turn on some kind of air,  it was to stuffy . The service was good. Will not recommend this place or come back.<//Review>

<Text>I got the Tropical Shrimp.  Delicious!  Something different for my palate!  It was 1/2 a pineapple grilled with the juice and chunks from it making it my bowl for the shrimp, plantains, and toasted shredded coconut.  Aesthetically appealing. It's filled with vibrant colors and Mexican decor.  Even a trio was playing for dinner.  Will visit again.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>We got there at 6pm just a table for 2. We were there for an hour and 20 mins they brought us the wrong orders TWICE in a row. They weren't very busy at all.  People got there after us and got their food before us. Didn't even want to taste the food after that.<//Text>< user>

Was visiting from out of town and my sister and I felt like some Hispanic food on taco tuesday. We both had never been here but heard a good recommendation from one of her friends. The price is amazing for the amount if food you get and it tastes delicious. I would recommend this place any day!<//Review>

The staff is utterly AMAZING!! Every time me and my husband go in (we are regulars, they are so fantastic), we are happily greeted and seated pretty quickly. We brought our family (really big group) and they still did a fantastic job. The food, make you want to stay and finish because you don't want to seem rude, haha. I LOVE the food, they make it just the way I ask. What are you waiting for? Go!< /Text>

The shredded beef tacos were the best  we've ever had and definitely worth going back for! Rice and beans are two of the things that you measure a Mexican restaurant by and we both thought that they're were good. The platter that the food is served on makes for an absolutely beautiful presentation!
The salsa and chips were a bit disappointing. The salsa was very heavy on the oregano and tasted like the tomatoes came from a can. The chips were crispy but had an aftertaste that was rather unpleasant. The red sauce on the enchiladas was very mild and lacked in flavor but the cheese was plentiful.
We're definitely planning on going back when we're in the area again because.. those shredded beef tacos were amazing!
The servers never lacked in smiles and were quick to notice if drinks needed to be refreshed.</review>

Poor service. Customer service has gone down hill. Long wait to be served food and no refill on water. Long wait and food was way too hot to eat. As if cooked long time. Deciding to walk out without pay!<//Review>

<Review>Didn’t take long to be seated but when we finally got a table we waited 30 min for the chips and salsa and 15 minutes after that to even get our drinks. People who were seated at the same time as us got their food first and we still were patient enough to wait another 20 minutes. Food was good, refills took a while to get, so overall they just need to work on the service. Waitresses were scattered through out the room, maybe work on a better way to assign waitresses to tables.<//Review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

Great atmosphere.  The food is always delish! Would highly recommend the fajitas or molcajete. My husband enjoys the seven seas. Busy place but always able to be seated.  Fast and friendly service. They were able to accommodate take out on a Saturday night with no wait. Fresh and festive!!< /Text>

<Text>I have always love this place, but this time the server martha/ skinny girl with blonde hair who took 20mins to get me my drink was horrible and rude, first of all dont roll your eyes at me. My mouth was on fire from my food. I watched you cleaned up 4 tables and helped others with their drink while I waited patiently for my drink, and yet I had to asked again for my drink.< /Text>< GmapID>

Great food, excellent service. Nice cozy place. My favorite dish: tropical shrimp. Try it you'll like it! During the week they have buffet, in my opinion, best around here!</Review>

< Review>
I have been to this restaurant several times. Each and every time has left me wanting to come back. Amazing food, Great service. The owner is a hard worker and works amongst his employees and sets a great example. He goes above and beyond to talk and relate to his customers. I have seen this building in the past and it has been many different restaurants, and I am so glad to see this restaurant still standing and growing.<//Review>

<Text>I wish I could give four and a half stars because this place is better than just four. The menu is extensive and prices about what you'd expect. Portion size is usually huge! Last time we went we shared a nachos and it was plenty, besides only costing $7. The servers are attentive and helpful. There are a few too many televisions hanging in the place for my taste and it makes sense when there's a big sporting event on to have them, but keeping them running showing everyday sporting events is too distracting. I would like to see a larger selection of domestic and imported beers as well, but they do have quite a few Mexican beers and so being what it is you'd have to cut that a break. Like I said, it's a shame I can't give four and a half stars. Come and enjoy!</Text>< pics>

<review>While ordering I learned the restaurant was out of guacamole and when I asked for avocado instead the waitress said they don't buy any because "They" say avocados are too expensive. This is odd to me considering they have menu items that state they come with avocado/guacamole but no signs anywhere that say they are out. Anyway, It was obvious that this is not the place for large parties especially on a Monday night. We had extreme difficulty getting drinks refilled, many guests opted to go straight to the bar for their drinks and our children at the kids table never got their drinks refilled. I kindly asked a different waitress (ours was very busy) for a refill for my son and I felt as though I was asking too much. Our plates of food were a good temperature however our tortillas were cold and stiff. The first Michelada I had was amazing and so I ordered a second and quickly regretted that choice as it was not the same quality. It came sort see through and was hard to drink to be honest.  I wanted to love this place because our family recommended it. However, it was just disappointing.< /review>< Pics>

<review>What makes this place special is that the owner makes you feel special. He cares about each and every person that walks into his and his wife's place. The food is prepared with love. You will taste it with every bite.<//review>< rating>

If you want great Mexican food especially fajitas come here. Stop wasting your life eating anywhere else. If you choose to continue to do so you must really hate yourself and I feel sorry for you. This place is great! What can’t you understand?< /Review>

Been living close to the area for 6 years and just last week found this little gem kind of hidden in the corner. Very nice art work, great customer service, best part food is great and prices not bad at all. Another plus plate sizes are big   (1dinner plate meal good enough for hubby & me). Table ware very appropriate for atmosphere. Will be taking out of town family & friends here, as we will also be regular customers.</Review>

Really good food I was very surprised.. the art work is a little on the religious side let's just say if your going to sin by ruining your diet God is watching you there.. lol and man would it be easy to ruin you diet there my boys got the king burrito and when they brought it out my eye about fell out of my head.. they were massive.. idk I guess I wasn't expecting them to be as big.. we will definitely be going back and I have already spread the word to the guys at my work..</text>

<Text>Amazing restaurant. Service was good on a busy night and the food was the best Mexican food I’ve ever had in Merced/Atwater. Price was very affordable, especially considering just how much food you get, they don’t skimp on anything. The whole restaurant is beautiful and there is an excellent Raider room in the back with all sorts of players painted on the walls. The staff was very friendly and welcoming. Will for sure be recommending to friends and family and will be back soon.<//Text>< user_name>

Excellent I must say ! Wow, this place far exceeded my expectations.  The carnitas were moist and the homemade corn tortillas were amazing ! I will come to Atwater every friday night for dinner now.< /review>

<Text>Michelada was a disappointment, I paid 6.50 for a beer and clamato! Also, I ordered tacos and they used canned salsa?! It was pasty and nasty
The meet was good but the food presentation and the salsa on the tacos was 👎👎.  My tacos were served as if I was at a family party just kind of thrown on the plate. So much for the nice looking restaurant. I probably will not step foot in there again. Place was pretty full the time I went(Monday afternoon)< /Text>< Name>

Eh.  When they first opened a few years ago this was a great place to go but the last few times I've been there it wasn't that good.  On almost every visit the owner went around to every table and thanked the customers for coming in.  I thought that was awesome that he showed his appreciation!< /Text>

No one attended us for 20 minutes, people who sat down after us got attended first. The food arrived about 35 minutes later and they got my order wrong. I asked for a chicken burrito, but I got Asada....i still ate it though..I was hungry AF..lol< /text>

If I could give Zero stars, I would.

The service was acceptable, but that is where it ends. The worst Carne Asada I have ever had, bad cut of meat, poorly prepared. The Beans were too salty, and the chips tasted like they were cooked in old oil. There are hundreds of Mexican restaurants in this area, and there is a much better one 1/4 mile down the road. After getting home and dealing with an upset stomach and greatly un-anticipated time in the bathroom, I can assure you, this was not only the first, but also the last time we will dine here.<//review>

Excellent molcajete and a fairly decent Chile relleno. Salsa spent a bit to much time in the blender, and I'd often have to wait five to ten minutes for a drink refill since it was busy.<//Review>
