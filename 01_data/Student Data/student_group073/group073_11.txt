Could not have had a better experience! Brought in our golf to get checked out (which was free) before a road trip. Everything recommended was work that actually needed to be done. Spoke with Kim and John, who were very professional and knowledgeable. The car was looked at and done in one day..... I have had to leave my car overnight for an oil change at a dealership before. Overall super fast and great/fair prices. Highly recommend :)</review>

<Text>Neighborhood Car Care is the best. They go above and beyond to make the customer happy. They are caring, conscientious and treat your car like it's their own. I highly recommend them. Their rates are very reasonable, they stand behind their work and they always greet you with a smile! Kim is a wonderful asset. She changed my headlight with a moment's notice to get me going!< /Text>< pics>

This is my fifth car that I have been servicing at Neighborhood Car Care. John and his team are helpful, efficient, honest and completely accommodating to last minute fixes while tracking the long term care needs of our vehicles. They are super organized and keep great track of records and pending issues for me- something I can not do myself. And the pricing is more than fair. We've been coming here for years and cannot recommend them enough.</Review>

They are a great group of people who are honest and provide great quality work! I have been taking my BMW their since I moved to the great city of Ventura and they have consistently met my needs with great quality work ranging from small jobs like oil changes (which can be fairly large job on a German designed car) as to starter/electrical issues (again, no small feat with German designed cars). They are knowledgeable, honest, hard working people from the Owner John to the technician's like Kim. Great work, fair prices. What more can you ask for... Strongly recommended :)<//Review>

I trust Neighborhood Car Care with both of our vehicles.  They are professional, friendly, always honest, don't over charge, and never try to Bull---t me about what is really going on with our cars.  Prices are fair, and they document everything that gets done so I feel like they really know how my car is doing, and recommend repairs accordingly.  I highly recommend them. John, the manager, treats us like we were family, and I've seen him treat other customers the same way.   We've been using Neighborhood Car Care for the last few years, and hope to continue using them as long as they're around!</text>

I have a 2006 Chevy Tahoe and I have typically been one who uses the dealership exclusively for any repairs or service my vehicles. But John was recommended to me and I have been completely satisfied and going to Neighborhood Car Care ever since. Thanks to John, Kim and all of the mechanics who do a great job keeping everyone on the road in Ventura.<//review>

man this is the place to go for all your mechanical needs, i was at the auto part store one time and i needed help installing tires on my rims while asking the employees there if they know any shop that could help i was being ignored until this guy asked me if i was ok, when i turned around he was dressed in mechanic suit so i explained my situation and he said yea no problem we are closing right now but i dont mind helping u out so i followed him to the shop and i saw another employee helping this family fixing there car and they were just so happy with help there, i my self do mobile mechanic but that day i just got out of the hospital and cant even lift a screw so by experience i can tell a satisfied customer. the facility was well equipped and very clean the staff very professional and happy, when u see happy employees that tell you alot about the owner. i definitely recommend this place to my own customers as sometimes there is jobs that i cant handle my self due to lack of equipment, these ppl are very honest down to earth and ready to help, the prices are very fair and cheap honestly for having a shop in that location.if they named this shop neighborhood care they do meant.<//Review>

I started using Neighborhood Car Care about 18 years ago.  My parents recommended it, and I love working with honest people, so I had no need to go elsewhere.  Not only will they tell you honestly what your vehicle needs, they will also tell you what it doesn't need.  They do excellent work.  Thank you to Jon and crew!  :-)</text>

I started using Neighborhood Car Care about 2 months ago and have been in for service twice. In both instances the required work was done on time and on budget. I was also very impressed that I was immediately recognized as a returning customer on my second visit - not something that you see very often. I'll definitely continue to use them.</review>

We have been taking our cars to John and all the wonderful people at Neighborhood Car Care for over 20 years. They are hands down the most skilled, reliable, and honest car repair service in the county. And the icing on the cake is that they are kind people. We would never take our cars anywhere else.< /Review>

These guys are so great you almost don't want to tell anyone about them, except that I do all the time. They are that rare, honest car repair place that you know won't rip you off. They're also sensitive to the fact that, if you drive a 13 year old car, you probably don't have a lot of spare cash to spend so they'll work to find ways to fix rather than replace. Can't say enough nice things about them.</Text>

I have been going here for at least 20 years and I sent my sister to Neighborhood Car care and I recommend it to everyone. They are friendly and accommodating. I've even run in after hours with a flat tire and they fixed it immediately. You will be happy if you use Neighborhood Car Care. Your vehicle will be fixed expertly, quickly and at a great price.</Text>

I trust them completely with everything from major engine overhauls to oil changes.  Do yourself a favor and make Neighborhood Car Care your mechanic too.</review>

I'm an out of towner that had a concern with a broken undercar shield.  They said bring it in and Jon took charge of having it quickly evaluated.  Made some simple repairs that he advised would be all i needed for a safe drive home with my granddaughter and not to worry about it when i got home!! At NO CHARGE!! Of course all jobs can't be free but their concern for their customer was beyond outstanding!! Thank you to Jon and his team.....and please trust him with your car care needs.<//Review>

Jon, Kim and the team are really rad and they have taken such good care of me. When I go in for any reason, I can count on feeling as if I am having my dad check out my car all while looking out for my safety and best interest. They are full of integrity, and this alone is what creates loyal customers. Neighborhood Car Care all da way!</text>

In my line of work, honesty and integrity are paramount, and therefore that is what I expect from those whom I choose to do business with.  Neighborhood Car Care have exhibited these traits each and every time I have used their services- not to mention the job gets done quickly and when they say it will... I refer all of my friends and family to them and will continue to use their services myself!</Text>

Jon has always been consistent with his honesty and approach in dealing with his customers.  I have been using NeighborHood CC, before the current location, and there are few automotive problems he can't handle.
I even buy my tires thru Jon, as he is competitive, with tire stores!  He will not only fix your "problem" but will advise what to watch for on future needs for your vehicle.  He is always looking for repeat business, which translates to "doing a good job" the first time, as all vehicles require maintenance.</text>

Honest and more than fair pricing. If you are looking for a mechanic that you can trust then Neighborhood Car Care is the place to take your cars. Had a leaky oil pressure switch. Jon replaced the oil pressure switch for a very decent price and turnaround time was only a few hours. You can tell the minute you walk into Neighborhood Car Care that you are dealing with honest and real folks. This is the place where I will always take my car for repairs in the future.<//Review>

My regular mechanic was on vacation when I needed a rush job-a new alternator. Many of our friends swear by NCC so I showed up on a very busy Monday morning. They called with and estimate and managed to get it done and out by 4 pm. Great service, fair price, pleasant to deal with.<//review>

We bring our cars for routine service and have had cars towed there.  Jon is the best - his understanding of cars and dedication to his customers is second to none.  When I call he is always friendly.  The mechanics always do a good job and if something is still wrong, Jon will review the previous service and fix it.  If you need a good mechanic, call Neighborhood.<//review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80e9ad1f5ddf2745:0xe6b0c38c5788b1f2< /Gmap_id></record>

<text>Jon and Neighborhood Car Care have been taking car of my cars for the past 16 years- since I started driving! They are always honest, fix only what needs to be fixed and give me a heads up about what will need to be done at the next visit or two. After buying my new car a few years ago I went to the dealership for the first few oil changes as they were free. After awhile they started making them more expensive and recommending other services. I promptly went back to see Jon and have never felt taken advantage of again.< /text>< gmapID>

Took my truck to Neighborhood Car Care after having taken it to two other shops that had told me two different stories of problems that my truck was suppose to have.  Went to Neighborhood Car Care, they told what they saw as the problems, which was much more reasonable than the other two stories.  Neighborhood Car Care did the repair, the vehicle runs great.  Saved me over one thousand dollars compared to what the other two shops had told me.  Neighborhood Car Care was honest and stuck to their estimates.  People you can trust.< /Text>

The service writer had her scared to even drive off the lot saying her tires were dangerous.  She called me and I suggested i call around for pricing at other companies.  I called and spoke with John.  After being quoted $1400 at America's Tire for only tires and balancing John was able to provide us with front shocks, alignment, tires, and an oil job for less than America's Tire quote.  They are quick and efficient and we will not go anywhere else after this experience.  Thanks again Neighborhood Car Care!!!!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<review>The difference here is Ed and Jon. Ed knows everything there is to know about cars and Jon is seconded to only to me when in comes to customer service. I learned from him on what it takes to keep customers happy. Quality service and meeting  expectations. Ed hired me almost 30 years ago as a young idiot painters helper and 1 year later I was his head painter. What I learned from both of them has made the shop I run the best of the best. Thanks Ed and Jon for everything. If I'm ever in town again I will have to come see ya. You can't go wrong here, try them. You won't be disappointed. Nice job on the expansion to more services guys.</review>< Resp>

<time>1426800558551< /time><Rating>5</Rating><review>I highly recommend Neighborhood Car Care. I have brought 3 diff vehicles over the years to John and his team and never had an issue. I price shop any new place before giving my business and all but one time they have been cheaper or right around the same price. Needed new tires and went to them to see what price they could do. We were way off. Instead of telling me to pound sand, John offered to have me order the tires through my retailer and have them shipped to his shop so I wouldnt have to bring them to him and then install them. If I would have kept that car, I would have done it. His team has always been honest and straight forward with my wife and I. I have had friend mechanics check their work and said they do an amazing job and are surprised how cheap sometimes they are. Highly recommend to anyone looking for a trust worthy mechanic.< /review>< pics>

I took my Silverado here a while back for diagnosis and repair.  NCC diagnosed it as a likely oil pump issue, but when they installed the new pump, and it didn't end up fixing the issue they actually didn't charge me anything.... No parts... No labor.... Nothing.  Unbelievable integrity with these guys.< /Text>

<review>We love Neighborhood Car Care. They go out of their way for customers. The prices for their services are better than competitive, and you will never feel that you are being nickeled and dimed. I like the people. I like the service.< /review>< Rate>

Not only do they do repairs and maintenance but you can get your vehicle cleaned inside and out. I always get a detail clean with my vehicle maintenance.< /text>

They replaced one of my struts after it broke on the road and were 1/3 cheaper than other chain workshops I visited before.</review>

Wanted to check out San Leandro's Farmer Market and what it had to offer.  This is a wonderful farmer's market in downtown San Leandro.  It is opened on Wednesdays from 4-8pm.  There is an abundant amount of merchants who are selling organic produce, fruits, eggs, flowers, desserts and ready made food.  I gotta make a shout for Alonso's Food!  He was really nice, patient and answered all my questions with a smile on his face.  He sells breads, assorted pastries, ready made pizzas, empanadas and cookies.  You want it, he got it. I can vouch that his products are top notch!  Too bad he doesn't have a retail store, but he also sells at Bayfair's Farmer Market on Saturday from 9am-1pm.  There is a small parking lot and ample street parking.  Just be aware that some have meters while others a couple of steps away do not.</Review>

<review>I went to this market several times, and I enjoyed shopping here because they have everything that I wanted. Besides, the vendors working out there was very good and kind towards me. They even had the best selections of fresh fruits, vegetables, and meats. I truly loved this place with all of my heart. Thank you so much. I will come back again and again!< /review><user_name>Tracy Kelly</user_name><rate>4<//rate><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The San Leandro Farmers’ Market is a popular family recreation activity that’s open seasonally from spring through fall.

It features the best locally and regionally grown produce, as well as other items like fresh flowers and baked goods, prepared food items, and arts and crafts.

The market is held downtown on Parrott Street. It frequently offers additional entertainment, including live music, wine and food tastings, cooking classes, and fun kid’s activities like art classes and face painting booths.

The season varies slightly from year to year, so check online or ask a local before heading out.</Review>

Fresh local foods locally sourced. Good atmosphere,  shade trees. Toughest part is finding parking nearby.  Some street meter parking is quite reasonable. Area Safeway parking lot fills up pretty quick ;-)<//review>

Small Farmers market but worth a walk through if your happen to be in the neighborhood. I'd give the experience a 15-20min max if you want to talk with one or two vendors. We found the ones we talked with where friendly and willing to share information with you.
Tried the hummus today and thought it was pretty good. Also it shouldn't discount the fact that it was nice trying some local foods. Family will be back next week to try another local vendor.< /review>

This place is awsome. I never thought I would go to a gas station just to order food. It's all made to order, fresh and hot. It's a great value light lunch; most sandwiches also come with a side. There breakfast sandwiches are good too. They got a great ham and cheese you just have to know to order it.</text>

Tried their hamburgers for the first time today.If you like old fashion burgers made the way you want them, then  your going to love it. red onions, fresh tomatoes, just the right amount of lettuce, the best part was the ton of melted cheese perfectly throughout the burger! took me back in time to the old fashion hamburger places where the cheese runs over the side of the burger and stick to the wax paper, yes I was a kid again and picked off the cheese.  GOOD JOB GUYS<//review>

I was disappointed with the times of the store. Online it states the store closes at 10pm. As I arrived the store says 9pm. The store was locked and closed 30 minutes prior to its scheduled time. A lady came out and asked us if we wanted something to go. If your store says its open until 9pm your doors shouldn't lock until 9pm<//text>

<Text>I was in there today for lunch today.  Food was excellent.  I had the sweet and sour shrimp.  I felt so bad for the waitress as she was all by herself.  There was an angry customer when she notified the customers that their credit card machine was broken.  A customer that had a name tag from Boot Barn that ordered pot stickers was so rude to her.  I felt so bad for her and could not believe the way Boot Barn's employee was acting.  Nevertheless, food was excellent.

<Text>Stopped by to see if this place could be added to my list of great places to eat here in Modesto waited to be seated 10 minutes the hostess handed me a menu then disappeared into the back 9 minutes later she came out with the bill and a fortune cookie for the couple seated across from me and promptly disappeared into the back she must have forgotten me 10 minutes later I was out of there so much for the hot and sour soup craving 30 minutes for lunch.... balls</Text>< Name>

It's okay. I didn't enjoy eating freezer burn peas in the fried rice. I did order this fried meat with this thick sauce on it. When I ate it, it was like warm BBQ with additional sugar sauce poured on top. The rest of the food was okay by Modesto's Chinese food restaurant standards that I am used to.</Review>

This is the real deal. Most carefully prepared food in Modesto. The style of the room is elegant you will feel as though you are in a city,  and have acquired style.<//Review>

Best chinese food in town hands down. Linda and the staff are very sweet. Serving sizes are very filling so suggest going as a group and ordering multiple items to all share off of. Crab rangoon, favorite appetitzer.< /Review>

<text>1st time there, WILL NOT be the last. Very laid back. VERY nice older lady explains the menu items you don't know & takes your order. Younger nice girl serves you & makes sure you're happy, or need anything.We had Spring rolls (2), Kung Pao Beef (Medium hot), Orange Chicken, Hunan Special Noodles, Coke & a water. $27.for 2 .       I would HIGHLY recommend this place to those who appreciate non-fast food style EXCELLENT food.< /text>< gmapID>

1. Don’t attempt to order with DoorDash, this restaurant refuses to fulfill those orders.
2. Attempted to go in to eat - the doors were open,  but there wasn’t a single person there. No customers and no staff.
3. Does this place even exist?<//Text>

Amazing barbers! I started coming here after my barber of 10 years moved, and I have loved it since day 1. Been going for almost 6 months. I highly recommend, its family owned and they all know what they're doing.< /text>

< review>
I don't understand Spanish and the lady who helped me didn't understand English, so with that being said. I still got the hair cut I wanted with very little communication!
These people know what they're doing!
I asked for a high fade with a little style on top, but with out me knowing started to give me a straight razor fade after I thought she got it perfect with the clippers. Unexpected and totally wicked!

Awesome people, awesome job, and awesome prices!

This is my new spot and will be coming here from now on!
Guess I'm gonna start to learn alot more Spanish 😁< /review>

Don’t let the guy cut your hair
He cut a part of my eyebrow off
He cut part of my hair at the top on accident
He messed up my sideburns
He didn’t know what to do< /review>

<review>So this my second year using them.
Last year was the first time .
It was PERFECT and I appreciate it.
However this year I made an appointment went and dropped my stuff,w2,bank papers etc.
So when I was there I mentioned that I will pick up my taxes next week.
So I drive to get so all I get I am sorry.
We didn't get it done ,was busy ,computer broke etc.
But was it my fault no .
By the way that was first week in March, the following week was March 8.
No follow up that they should call the customer .
After that I called MANY TIMES,MANY MASSAGES,no one calls me at all.
I went there last week of March oh so sorry.
Finally I was able to get it done after 2 months
April 29 at a different location.
I asked the tax person is the anyway you can give me a little more discount because waiting for a long time .
Answers was I tried and they allowed her to give me the coupon $50,and the DM authorized additional $25.
Long story short I paid my fees.
Then I discovered that SHE has put a Pause on my taxes.
Why again computer Broke.
Guess what it was not my fault.
So I was able to make an appointment by second week of June and finally got it done .
I looked at my papers SHE NEVER GAVE ME THE $50 OFF ,NORE THE $25 That the DM OFFERED.
JUST A SIMPLE $35 .

<review>I’ve been going here since 2015 and always get quality service. I just make a appointment and when I arrive they are ready to help me out with little or no wait time. I usually go to Felix who is professional and friendly ( the others are too ). He is very detailed and also very helpful with explaining the tax Information or questions I may have so I can better understand what is happening with my taxes so there is no mistakes and I get the most out of my refund. To best sum it up I got more on my refund than last year and that’s ALL GOOD! Checc them out.</review></record></dataset><record>

My tax preparer Veronica was fantastic but Jackson Hewitt prices are ridiculous it is people out here getting a Taxes done for a little bit of nothing and these people charge you almost 500 I will never go there again but the person that prepared my taxes was fantastic so Veronica is getting a 5stars not Jackson Hewitt< /text>

< Review>
Initially, I was suppose to see someone else at Hewitt. What a BUMMER! I thought I lost out. Losing out in this case was a BLESSING. VERONICA WAS THAT BLESSING! My first time EVER getting my taxes prepared by Hewitt. Though there were other locations much closer to me, I  ended up at this particular one.......and it couldn't have been better. PATIENT,  KNOWLEDEABLE, and GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, is what sums up VERONICA. She focused on me from beginning until the end, without being distracted. She was very patient, making sure she crossed all her ts and dotted all her Is. Very calm, polite, and knowledgeable. Everything was explained in a manner that made sense to the common person, such as myself. She invited questions and wanted to be certain I  understood all that was being done and said. Very thorough. She made the whole process a very smooth one. The fee I paid was so worth it and then some, all due to her. I have found myself a NEW TAX PREPARER, whom I am and will be very happy with in the future. THANK YOU VERY MUCH, VERONICA :-)    ~~~~~V.L.B~~~~~~< /Review>

Worst place I have ever been to. They never answer their phone. The office is never open when they say they are going to be open. The tax preparer said she was going to send my paperwork in the mail then forgot. One week later I call her. She’s says she’s going to email me. She finally emails me and doesn’t attach the documents correctly. I have been trying to get a hold of her at least twice a week, by calling her and stopping by the office and she is MIA. I guess people are only important and matter to them when they are trying to rip you off at tax season.< /review>

The price is decent and the restaurant is located in front of a badminton gym. I like that it's out of the way but the food is only decent. It hits the spot but not sure if they could survive in a much more competitive neighborhood.</Text>

<gmap_id>0x80c2db6a08889749:0x8d6728cef6e78a6c< /gmap_id><Review>Little disclaimer before we start: I'm Indonesian, came in a group of 5 (all Indos), 2 have roots from Kalimantan/Borneo, one of which is from Singkawang and the other from Pontianak (not far from Singkawang). I must emphasize, This Is The Bomb.

Main dishes we got:
- Bakmi Singkawang: literally my favorite bowl of noodles in the entire LA county, like seriously. The texture and the flavor is just so on point, it puts other Indonesian noodle shops to shame (*cough* West Covina). To be fair, it doesn't have the same taste as your average noodles because it does have a slight vinegar taste, but that complements the flavors this dish has to offer. Like usually I'm the type of person to drown my noods in soup (don't @ me) but this? Heck no, the flavors are just too perfect that it shines, even without the soup 10/10
- Kwetiau Goreng Singkawang: solid dish, the kwetiau has a mild wok flavor, and the toppings are just seasoned perfectly to complement those noodles. I'm personally not a kwetiau girl, would probably have chosen the mie goreng instead but it's okay because this is still fire.
- Sup Sayur Asin: we didn't order this soup but it came with two of our dishes mentioned above (I think). But, I kid you not, this is the best sayur asin I've had in a long long time, probably better than most I've had in Indo. It has a bit of pork pieces in the bottom and the veggies in it aren't smelly at all (it's common for the veggie to be smelly). Honestly I would come back just for this soup ngl
- Nasi Campur: it came with the thick clear gravy sauce (not sure what it's called) but if it doesn't, just ask for it. I loved this one but I think it's missing something, maybe the broth isn't salty enough? Maybe the rice wasn't soft enough? I'm not even sure. For those wondering: the pork belly was super fat (which I love) but I know not everyone is super into that.
- Nasi Capcai: super nostalgic because it tastes exactly like what I used to eat; the veggies are still a bit crunchy which I know some people prefer. Definitely one of the healthier options or if you want to eat more veggies.

Appetizers & Others:
- Hakong: 8/10 without the sauce, 10/10 with the sauce. Bruh. That sauce is magic I swear. It complements the hakong so well with some balanced sweetness, sourness, and savoriness. Without it, it needs just a touch more salt but I think it's meant to be eaten with the sauce, so I'm not complaining haha.
- Choi pan: according to my friends, these are not singkawang style, but it's super delicious nonetheless. The sauce is the one that came with our kwetiau but it's delicious and spicy, but not as watery as the one I'm used too. The filling itself is super flavorful (with quite a good amount of white pepper), the wrapper is kinda chewy/bouncy in a good way--and is not too thick.
- Es doger: omfg they have ketan singkong and kolang kaling in it!! They had some interesting stuffs in it like popping boba and lychee jelly I think but I don't really mind it lol. The drink part is not overwhelmingly sweet, just the right amount for this dessert (I'm sure they use Marjan syrup)
- Sambal terasi: if yall need more spicy, do ask for this. You're welcome.

General situation:
Came when LA had outdoor dining open, but not indoor (3/13). I heard they're going to have both indoor and outdoor next week. Their outdoor seating is a spacious patio with some heater to keep you warm. The owners and workers are all Indonesian, with the owners originally from Singkawang. I know they serve Thai food but we didn't really ask why nor try it. All of the utensils and plates were single use (paper plates to serve the food, styrofoam plates for us to share), except for the bowls used for the noodles and soups where they used legit noodle bowls.

TL;DR: they have awesome Indonesian food that everyone must try. If you think Borneo Kalimantan Cuisine is good, try this one and you'll be blown away. 10/10 would come back and bring my Indo and non-Indo friends and families here!!</Review>< username>

Ambiance is good, food is good, price is good for the Indonesian food size (note: Indonesian food size is smaller than average American food size), parking was not an issue during dinner time, restaurant name was clearly visible from the street when I came after dark for dinner, customer service is great. I ordered Soto Betawi. It had a lot of meat--very fulfilling and tasty, almost like the one I tasted in Indonesia. They gave red bean dessert, which is a plus for Asian restaurant. I had a great experience.</review>

One of the few Indo-Thai restaurant in the area; honestly it's more of a resto vibe than a cafe. We came over dinner and ordered the mini-lumpia (10pcs) rolls and Pad Thai veggie. Food was tasteful and flavorful. However, during the course of our meal we saw a tiny black hair strand on the the pad Thai. Hence, we didn't finish the food. I'm sure its an isolated case but deeply disappointed nevertheless. On the positive side, their service was moderately fast. Prices are fair. Menu is somewhat limited from main Entree (e.g., No Nasi Rendang) to Appetizer. Staff were attentive, amiable and professional. Ample of parking spot. Overall, I will give it a try again and hopefully they will rectify the unsanitary issue.<//Review>

If you are thinking about ordering takeout from Singkawang Cafe (they offer delivery via Uber Eats), my suggestion is to avoid this option. Actually, considering their rudeness and disregard for customer service, my suggestion would be to find an alternative location. Singkawang Cafe messed up an order of 6 items from Uber Eats, preparing only half the items ordered (total of 3/6 prepared). That's okay, people make mistakes. When I called, they said that they messed up the order, and apologized, they could clearly see the order chit which had six items on it. I was upset at this point because my wife and children were hungry and we had half of our order ready. But the icing on the cake was when we spoke to the restaurant management in person, they changed their story saying that it was Uber Eats that made the mistake, only sending half the order to them. It is this dishonesty that made me write this review. Mistakes made, yes, it happens. Lying about it to the customer to cover your mistakes, that's another story. All we asked for was for the restaurant to cover the delivery charge since we had to go pick up the order ourselves (we even told them restaurant credit would be fine), and we were refused. I've ordered from this restaurant several times previously, but this time would be our last. Very disappointing.<//Text>

I wish this place existed when I was still going to high school in this area. I didn't try any of the Thai food bc that's much easier to come by, but it's cool knowing of a place I can take friends where there's a bit of variety.<//Review>

Went in with a friend to "open" and old piercing, and was treated to an hour's worth of excellent information on options. Prices were great, shop was cleanand professional. 100% 10/10 will be back.< /text>< pictures>

Dee was amazing. I brought my daughter in for her first real piercing and she was super nervous.  Dee eased her mind and gave superb advice as well as conveyed relevant facts.  Thanx Dee! 💜< /Text>

Had the owner do a cover-up tattoo for me and it looked worse than the original. Didn't even cover it. Dude had that rock star attitude, (bragged how he tats all the local rappers) wouldn't work with me. Had another dude start a tattoo that looks really bad, said it'll look right when it's finished, then he suddenly moved to Dakota. Never again.</review>

Great vibe here! From set up to finish Frank, Turo, Jay and the rest of the artists are true professionals! These guys know what they’re doing, saturating each piece to give it maximum depth and realism. Turo Mora is a gifted artist who can bring your idea to life!</review>

<Text>Kept my dogs here for the weekend. Didn't take pictures but they are kept outside in covered fenced cages that are just connected to each other in huge groups that are built over a dirt field.

Why isn't that on the lovely pictures that are posted for this place 🤔

My dogs stunk and desperately needed a bath when we brought them home because of the environment they were kept in.
My dogs are inside dogs so I felt bad for them.I didn't drop them off so I didn't know until I picked them up.
I've never used a pet boarding place before but I guess this is normal 🤷‍♂️

Here's a picture I found online that looks similar to what I saw. Just imagine isles and isles of these and they are all connected. Dog comfort was not intended when this place was built.
My dogs were still alive so ill give 2 stars<//Text>< Pics>

This is a great place to leave your pets if you want them to have loving and caring hands while you're away. They make sure the resort kennels are cleaned daily and all the employees there love your babies as well!! They do all that they can to make sure your pets are very well taken care of. They make sure to call me with every problem my baby may be giving them and discuss other options that may be better for him. He rubbed his paws raw trying to get out of his kennel and also hurt his mouth tugging the fence. Eventually we figured out what worked for my poor baby, who was only distressed from experiencing life in a kennel for the first time, and most likely will start to show distress when he is there for a longer period of time, but I have the upmost confidence that they will take great care of my baby and make sure he comes home safe and healthy! I love Cowen's Pet Resort and I highly recommend you bring your pets here for professional and loving care for your babies! Thank you everyone at Cowen's Pet Resort, for making my baby as comfortable as possible during my away trip. I look forward to bringing little Louie there for all future trips he can't be a part of.< /Text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>This was our first time leaving our dogs anywhere. We gave Cowen's pet resort a try and I have to say we loved it! Our pets came back home happy! Both our dogs would cry when we would put them in the car to take them anywhere and bark at any dog and anyone passing by. Since we left them there the whole way back home they both layed down on the back without making any noise. We were so surprised! There is a difference in our dogs and its a good difference. Thats a definite that we will be using them in the future.< /review><pics>None</pics>< resp>

I searched for months for a place I felt comfortable leaving my k9 companion. Everyone seemed very caring & assured me my dog would be happy there &  treated well with the best of care. My dog is my emotional support dog & even though it was very difficult leaving him I am so happy I chose Cowen's. They communicated with me with updates & photos through texts on a regular basis. Everyone took great care of him  & he made many friends there. He was happy &  in great condition when I picked him up!!! I recommend Cowen's Pet Resort to everyone😊<//review>

Great service.  They took care of my two dogs; one who does not like strangers, so I was concerned as to how well the staff would be able to care for him. To my surprise, they were able make friends with him and he was well cared-for. The staff is very passionate about what they do and their actions show it.  The kennels are clean, large and well-kept. I have no problem leaving my dogs with them again.<//text>

My two small dogs have stayed twice for several days.  They were kept in the same kennel at our request and were well taken care of.  We brought our own dog food that they were used to eating. Our dogs, naturally, were very happy to see us, healthy and suffered no ill effects from being boarded.  Staff seemed very friendly and caring towards us and our pets.  Will use again.<//Review>

We've been using Cowen's for about ten years now and our dog loves it. She gets excited as we pull in the driveway and can hardly wait to get into the office! We always hear good things about her when we come back and can tell that they've been attentive to her needs. I met a lady who used to work there once and when I mentioned what my dog would do she said that she would often see that kind of reaction. She said the pets love it there and the staff really loves animals.</text>

I take my dogs here every time I leave town and they do a good job looking after them. My dogs are excited to go there which I see as a good sign and clearly like the staff. The prices are good and I've never had a problem. I take my dogs about once per month on average. I recommend to friends.

A lot of reviews are decrying the grooming - I don't get my dogs groomed here. I typically bathe them after a stay. It is an outdoor kennel after all, and dogs smell after being outside. They have coverage from the sun for shade and misters, and there are houses to insulate if it's cold.< /Text>

<text>We have been bringing our cavaliers to Cowens since we got our first one 13 years ago. The staff has always taken great care of our fur babies and they have always been happy and well taken care of. We always have them bathed and they do a great job making them look and smell clean. The staff even made a point of calling us one time when our dog was not eating and even made her special food to get her to eat. It’s so nice to know my dogs are in good hands when we regretfully have to leave them.</text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

Our two German Shepherd Dogs, Apollo and Athena, seemed to have enjoyed their stay. After the dogs gave us an excited 3 minute greeting when we picked them up, they seemed tired out and relaxed on the ride home and appear to be very healthy. Everyone we talked to there was really friendly and seemed like genuine animal lovers - the lady outside even took pictures of the dogs when they were playing and posted to Facebook.</review>

My husband picked up our dog Max today from a 3 night stay. Max was filthy, smelled awful, and starving. Between all of his toes on both the front and back legs is raw. His paws were completely swollen and he wouldn't stop licking them. His face is red and swollen where a muzzle would go. Cowens boosts about their pet grooming, but I think whoever attempted to groom him caused him harm. I'm terribly disappointed and cannot understand how this could happen. Our dog is loving and cooperative and should not have been returned to us this way. I hope others read this and understand that not everyone is going to care for your pets. We will not be taking our dog back. Max doesn't shed much, but after bringing him home, his fur is almost falling out. I have taken pictures of all of these things and wish I knew how to upload them</review>

< Review>
This kennel used to have great service. These last two times I've taken my dog I've picked him up smelling awful! If they just "bathed and groomed" him then why is he stinky and looks dirty? Their solution was to spritz him with scented spray! The second thing I didn't like is that he was also really really thirsty. I'm sure I wont take my pet here anymore.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>Kona enjoys her stay at Cowans pet Resort because the staff is friendly, she is well taken care of, and she enjoys her socializing with other pets. I highly reccomend this resort for your family pet. It is the place that I feel comfortable leaving her because she is well cared for.<//Review>< pictures>

The kennels are large enough for big dogs and they offer a variety of treats you can purchase for your fur baby at a reasonable price.  Just wish they were open longer hours,</review>

They must of like it cuz buddy slipped out of his collar and ran back to the girls when we were trying to put them in the truck! So they will be staying there when I go out of town again thank you.😀 I will refer you to my friends and family!!</Review><name>Kim Pool</name><response>None<//response></record>

Dogs were a bit stinky, but so happy to come home. They were spoiled and accommodated. One of my dogs is a big o’ chicken and the pair of dogs were moved to be less bothered.<//Review>

<Review>Delicious! Every week since the pandemic pizza king stepped in and help the community. By feeding our volunteers at United hands MP of Compton

The pizza is very hot and tasty very flavorful all the volunteers including myself love the pizza being that I’m lactose intolerant there’s no cheese on mine which is cool he caters to lactose intolerant people

I highly recommend this Pizza king Compton the food is delicious. And you’ll feel part of the family when you visit</Review>< userid>

<Text>North Long Beach resident and this spot has AMAZING PIZZA!! Hot and fresh too. We usually order from Dominoes down the way but this is our new spot. A "hole in the wall" location but their service is great. I like that when I call they tell me what specials will better suite my needs and save me $$$. You won't be dissapointed! Wings are good too!!< /Text>< rate>

<text>I had previously gave it a 5 star. But hadn't  been  there in a while. I called to order a 5 dollar pizza. Well they no longer had it. If I wanted a one topping pizza for 7 dollars and something I would just go to Domino's and get 2 topping pizza for about 8 dollars ok.<//text>< GmapID>

<Review>First time ordering from this place and definitely the last. Our pizza showed up looking like they met with the delivery guys floorboard. So naturally we call to complain and they start going off on us! The lady kept saying that they have great pizzas and there is no way we were telling the truth. At first we wanted them replaced I mean that was 28 bucks. They offered to come pick up the pizzas and give us our money back... but we were hungry and decided to just eat it.<//Review>< pics>

For hood Pizza it is the best. You can buy a pizza plate with 2 slices for 1.75. The pizza is always hot and freshly made. I really like their chicken salad.</Review>

Once arriving at the location I was greeted by Noemi and Kathy. I began to tell Noemi that I was looking for a place to store my stuff. She went into detail about the different units they had and asked about the items I would be storing so that she can assess which option would be best for me . Noemi made the whole experience as simple as possible while always looking out for what was best for me . She offered me a great deal which I had no idea they had ! She definitely saved me money while getting me a really good size storage. She went above and beyond by personally showing me how to put in my code to enter the building and also for the elevator. I highly recommend this place and Noemi, she was very friendly and informative.<//text><name>Chuy Isidro<//name>< Rate>

Exactly what you want from a storage unit. Easy access, carts are always available and the staff is friendly and helpful. With the help of Naomi and Kathy made the cancellation process extremely easy and that is why I will be using this location again when storage needs arise.</review>

Had to move units a couple weeks ago and while it could have been a purely stressful day, Anthony's personality and care made the whole experience lighter.  I don't usually do reviews but had to give him a shout out for handling the issues with tact and maintaining a great vibe through out the experience.  Remember I was moving $#!+, I should have been in a horrific mood! Lol. Big shouts to Anthony<//Text>

This location has outstanding customer service, with Noemi and Kathy going above and beyond for their customers. They're always so welcoming and attentive when I ask for help or information regarding my rental space, they both should be placed under the definition of Patient because they have so much of it and I always leave knowing my space is safe on their watch. Thank you Noemi and Kathy for your hard work and positive attitude, you are truly appriciated.< /Review>

Walked in here for some questions, Noemi was extremely helpful and very nice she answered all my questions nicely. I then noticed this facility is very nice and clean. I would strongly recommend this location for anyone who wants quick and professional service. 6 star service If I could.<//text>

I generally don't leave reviews but Jose was very helpful so I thought I would, he explained the insurance to me very well and even escorted me to the back where the unit was. Very professional the whole time. I did notice there were only two carts though and people were checking them out. In such a big building it crossed my mind they may be hard to get if I needed one  seems like there would be at least one for every other floor. Otherwise, great experience.</Text>

I highly recommend this location for your storage needs, besides the key location, you will find very dedicated staff to offer you the best of what you need. I was fortunate to meet Noemi whom with professionalism and kindness showed me options and help select a 10x7 unit, we’ll taken care by the way. Moving is not fun, It’s so comforting to find people to help you along the way, thanks again Noemi.<//Review>

<Review>Noemi was my service provider. She was very nice and knowledgeable. So was another provider Jawan. I love the location and cleanliness of this storage facility. The storage unit that I rented was to my liking, it was kept nice and clean. They have all the necessary equipment you can purchase to pack up your belongings and store them safely. They also provide complimentary dollys if you need to store anything heavy and bulky into your storage unit. I liked their restroom, as it too was kept nice and clean. They also practice good COVID 19 measures at this place. I can honestly say that I had a great experience at this place and I would definitely recommend this public storage location, if anyone need a place to store their stuff. 👍🏻</Review><Rating>5<//Rating><UserId.>104234878792211870192</UserId.><name>The Tyrant<//name></record>

I was in the process of down-sizing and Dominick took the time to show me my options. He assisted me in getting getting my items from the old space to the new smaller space.  It was super quick and easy and made my day. Also, having used this location for 8 years, I have to say every person in the office has been helpful.  Thanks guys!< /Review>

<review>This location is great. David and Naomi are super friendly and very helpful. They conduct daily patrols of the facility and the whole location is super clean. They have dolly's and carts you can borrow to help make the move in/out easy. You can use the ramp gate to make the unloading easier but you have to ask the desk to open it for you. Overall it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend this location<//review>< pictures>

Their email communication is consistent and kept me up-to-date on my unit. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they keep the facility and restroom clean. Overall, it is a great storage facility that is conveniently located. A special thank you to Noemi and Mimi for making my move-out process smooth and stress-free!< /text>

I would definitely recommend this public storage to my friends and family. The staff is always so nice and knowledgeable & helpful! Thank you Noemi for assisting me and my boyfriend with all our needs! I never had a problem at this public storage. This was my first time having a public storage unit and it met all my expectations. =)< /review>

I had rented a unit from this facility in 2016 and wound up coming back! Management has done a really good job in upgrading the facilities and security! I was helped by Noemi and she had excellent customer service. She continuously followed up with me throughout the rental process and made me feel so welcomed!< /Text>

Currently renting a storage room. It’s always clean and the staff is lovely. Naomi is extremely friendly and resourceful. She allow me to take some of my stuff before  the 10 minute lockout since being a new customer I wasn’t aware. I recommend 10/10 for any storage needs. I want to say thank you Naomi for always being helpful.<//text>

Clean and convenient. Excellent service!  Stefany helped me and took all the time necessary - the unit I had reserved was too small for what I needed but she showed me several at the next size and let me pick the one I liked best. She was positive, patient, professional. Also, they do daily security checks on the locks of all units.<//review>

<text>I went in this past Sunday to rent out a storage and Jasmine was super helpful. She was friendly, informative, and guided me step by step on renting the storage. I wasn't 100% sure which size I wanted to rent out so I was taking my time and she didn't rush me at all. She told me to take all the time I needed to think and choose. If you're ever in the area looking to rent out in a public storage, go to this location and look for Jasmine!<//text><Time>1566930930404< /Time><userid>107945233155428308599< /userid><Rating>5</Rating>< pictures>

Units are well kept. Staff is always friendly and attentive. When I first moved in, I had an issue with the door of my storage unit. Within a couple of days, they replaced the door and it included an upgraded hinge for the lock, which added security for the unit.  Should I need a storage facility in the future, I would use them again.</text>

Raelyce who works the front desk is an absolute sweetheart...very kind, helpful and patient. Thanks for great customer service all these years.

Always helpful as is the guy he usually works with whose name escapes me right now.

I highly reccomed this site if you are in need of space as the staff really goes the extra mile.

Thanks for all the help guys.

Plus I like their names, Noemi reminds me that Steve Tisch at Escape Artists movie productions has No Emmy Award, something Lorne Michael's, Ellen Degeneres,  Adam McKay and Will Ferrell as well as Joel Silver like to remind him of on a regular basis and Jawan reminds me of the movie Jawanna Man, a movie my ex worked  on.</Review></record>

<Text>Raelyce was the sweetest and most helpful to my family, I was in a hurry at first and she let me come back when it was easier for me, she also took us up to the seventh floor (her favorite) to show us better storage units. Such efficiency and always with a smile on her face. Great service!</Text>< Pics>

I think her name was Estrella, the service was really great. She made things easier than the last time I was here and this rude lady attended me but I'm glad I had her today. Definitely recommend this place and try to get her to assist you, shell make it easier and quicker. The place looked very clean as well.

This lady told me "I told you we are closing the gates at 5:45". She was about to lock us in the storage and she was aggressive and mean.
No respect to people..if you r reading this people, wait until everyone leave the storage..worst experience with that lady. Get people that are nice and fire her!!< /text>

Arturo is amazing - his customer service skills are stellar! We had a really difficult situation. Arturo patiently listened and then helped us through it all - recommended our options, answered all of our questions, and processed the transaction we elected to pursue. Highly recommend this location thanks to ARTURO!< /text>

I have enjoyed my visit at this public storage. An employee named STAR has taken out time to thoroughly explain the process of starting with Public Storage. I thought it was going to be confusing. However, with her positive attitude and patience all my questions were answered with ease. Thank you so much. This employee has set the standard on how customer service should be like!< /review>

<Review>This location doesn’t even deserve one star. I was lied to and swindled consistently by the staff. The charged me an extra month when all I needed was one more day to get my stuff out. Arturo told me it would be fine to come in the next day (the 1st), to finish getting my last few items because they wanted to close for the day. I went back the next day and he himself told me that’s not the case and that I had to pay for another month, no exceptions. After all was said and done, I got a call from their corporate office who was still trying to bill me for a space I had vacated weeks ago (yet another blunder).  I then alerted their office of how inappropriate this was, especially considering how badly I was treated and why I moved in the first place. Thy wanted to know what happened, and I told them the last straw was that Arturo told me I had to pay for another month no matter what, after his promise otherwise. And the corporate employee told me that’s not true, and that they pro-rate people for late check outs all the time. Funny, when I called corporate to find this out, no one ever got back to me. No attempt to help me. They then had another manager try to get in touch which me about some sort of resolution...something I never asked for since I’d given up on their help long before that. But he only called me once, in the middle of the work day when I can’t possibly stop to handle this type of conversation. This company lies about the lies they tell. Please do yourself a favor and never let anyone you know rent at this location.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Raelyce is an exemplary customer service representative she goes the extra mile to make sure that my account is updated and she informs me of any public storage information I need to know. I appreciate her kindness and consideration and all the wonderful qualities she possesses in customer service and as an exemplary individual. Considering that I’ve been with public storage since 2004, it’s an honor to have her here working at Public Storage. Kudos Public Storage!!!<//Review><rate>5<//rate>< user>

<Review>Great facility, clean, great staff, just overall construct of public storage is a horrible rip off, if you pay for a unit they will not give you a refund to your payment source instead you wait (I am still waiting) on a reimbursement check. There is also not a pro-rated rate if you stay after the first, so you must hurry up and move all of your items and not pay. I over paid also by billing error after they did not send receipt. Still working on it to get reimbursed. The automated call system makes my skin burn the amount of work it takes to get to a live correspondent is unbelievable.</Review><resp>None< /resp>< Time>

<text>The girls at the front desk are amazing. Cynthia and Vanessa are friendly, knowledgeable and always willing to help me when I have questions about my storage. I really recommend this location to everyone looking for storage because the girls will get you amazing deals and have a lot of sizes.

Do yourself a favor, reserve a storage unit HERE!

Not only does it include amazing customer service by friendly, professional staff but it's also an affordable price for LA in a navigable location. Don't forget the convenience of managing your account online while having a flexible month to month contract :)

Obviously everyone knows that moving is stressful. My move was especially stressful, not because the fact I was moving from San Diego, but everything that you think could and couldn't go wrong...went wrong. From broken boxes from accident prone movers and sitting in traffic with empty gas tanks to wrong keys by missing landlords and ruined newly bought furniture and mishandled sentimental belongings- I begged the day to be over and naturally I dreaded my last stop:storage. It was heaven- the exact opposite of how my day was going.
Seriously I'm considering to believe in angels because when I went there, I easily spotted and found parking right away. I was greeted sincerely and helped right away! They worked with the movers and everything was stored and moved unbelievably smoothly! Words cannot express my gratitude and satisfaction. Thank you so much Stanley and Yesenia, I highly recommend you to go to this Public Storage unit!!< /Review>

Raelyce helped me at this location, she was super helpful and patient and explained everything in detail about the different units and privinf. When I came in there were a few people ahead of me and she acknowledged me and checked in every few minutes even though I could tell she was very busy and the only person at the desk. Awesome experience with her, hope you get her during your visit.< /Text>

I would definitely recommend this Public Storage to others. Stanley has been incredibly helpful on multiple occasions. One time he helped me move in for 45 minutes after closing, and another time he helped me resolve a late fee my account got dinged with unwarned. The customer service here is through the roof, above and beyond the call of duty. Thanks!< /text>

Not only does it include amazing customer service by friendly, professional staff but it's also an affordable price for LA in a navigable location. Don't forget the convenience of managing your account online while having a flexible month to month contract :)

Obviously everyone knows that moving is stressful. My move was especially stressful, not because the fact I was moving from San Diego, but everything that you think could and couldn't go wrong...went wrong. From broken boxes from accident prone movers and sitting in traffic with empty gas tanks to wrong keys by missing landlords and ruined newly bought furniture and mishandled sentimental belongings- I begged the day to be over and naturally I dreaded my last stop:storage. It was heaven- the exact opposite of how my day was going.
Seriously I'm considering to believe in angels because when I went there, I easily spotted and found parking right away. I was greeted sincerely and helped right away! They worked with the movers and everything was stored and moved unbelievably smoothly! Words cannot express my gratitude and satisfaction. Thank you so much Stanley and Yesenia, I highly recommend you to go to this Public Storage unit!!< /Review>< Pictures>

<userid>116076427073945509551</userid><Time>1549399644241</Time><Review>Got to the storage unit early and the staff was welcoming. Kelsey, a manager i believe, came back from her lunch a bit early to help me out. In order to help her coworker, Raehice(?), go on her lunch. Very helpful, friendly, and accommodating both of them. I reserved a storage until too small for my stuff so Kelsey helped me find the right thing for my situation. Letting me know about the special deals i was available to gain, as well as patiently going through the electronic paperwork. While she explain everything clearly, she answered any complicated questions i had. In the end, the experience went very smoothly. We had a friendly conversation, which is refreshing because good casual customers service isn’t everywhere. I helped them practice their spanish a bit haha. Moving is always a hassle so it helped my mentality being helped so well on a rainy day. They opened the orange roll up doors so we wouldn’t need to move the moving truck. A dolly was available for use, as long as an ID is given. There’s also a restroom in case of any long moving days. Thanks again ladies!< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bba0c490b3cb:0xf3b9f88b5161f0b3</gmap_id></record>

I only needed the unit for a couple of days. I asked the guy working if I don't use the full month do I get some of money back and he said yes. A couple days later I get my stuff out and get ready to check out and I ask the girl when the money will go in my account and she says they don't give money back. I wasted $80 for NOTHING. I wouldn't of got a unit of I knew that I wouldn't get some money back and she closed the account before I can say I will just keep it for the month than. I am just so pissed they need to get their stuff straight.< /Text>

<Review>This turned out to be the worst experience of my Life.  I had a storage for over TEN years because my place is small and I don't have family here.  I fell behind during layoffs.... Public storage rightfully sold my items.  I did lose them.  What is heartbreaking is my Birth certificate, social security number, medical files, other medical info from a former Business were given to the buyer after Kamisha Quall Promised me she would not allow the buyer to take my personal items.  Nobody watched him take the things.  I received a call from Venice at the location stating, "The man came down and said he only took sixty percent of your stuff."  He had almost ALL and only left junk.  He took ALL my clothes, including private Fraternity wear that will cause problems for anyone wearing it in public and not being a member.  My Grandmother and Mom pictures, family Memories that I can't get back.  Julie Turner from the Corp office got the buyer on the phone to see if he would sell the items back to me, at whatever cost.  The interpreter who spoke to this non-English speaking person said, "He don't want to sell it back to you.  My HEART dropped, he knows what he took.  How can someone assist a potential criminal.  Cristina at another Public Storage place said she knew the man, he is a regular there, and she tried calling but had to stop helping for fear she would be reprimanded by Kamisha.  This is so sad.   Thanks Public Storage, I feel like I can't go on.</Review>< Pictures>

I called to inquire about a storage space for my mother and Dawn was very helpful and made an appointment for me to come see the space. I arrived 30 minutes before closing on a Saturday with my mom (who is a senior citizen) and Dawn and Brittany took so much time with us and were both patient and knowledgeable. Dawn knows Public Storage's policies like the back of her hand. She answered all of my mom's questions and explained EVERYTHING including the vague insurance requirements. We secured the space and they even let us linger after closing to put a few things in our unit that we'd brought along in the car. My mom said it was so nice to encounter such professional and courteous young people. Thank you Dawn and Brittany for your help and kindness.</review>

<username>Doug Grooms</username><Review>Moving is not fun and just getting started is tough enough.  It was really cool to walk into the Crenshaw location however and be greeted by two completely friendly and helpful people.  Stanley helped me with boxes...POLITELY reminded me of other things I would need to pack and also told me about the return policy.  He asked if I needed temp storage  (I do not) and essentially covered all bases.  He even insisted he help me out with my boxes to the car.  Juliann was also friendly and fun.  It was just a nice environment to walk into and you could feel the good energy.  Thanks Public Storage.....you made the first part of this so much easier and I know I'll be back.  Kind Regards,  Doug<//Review>< date>

<text>Good storage facility; great staff at the front desk. The two women who signed me up, Desiree and Raysa, were so wonderfully helpful and informative; Desiree answered every question I had, and Raysa stayed late to make sure I was able to move all my belongings in.

However, the hours here are terrible. I often have trouble getting here. I sometimes feel as if I pay this place way too much money to just occasionally drive past my stuff and wave at it.<//text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This company is a joke. They change staff and district managers like socks. The convience of the location clashes with the unconventional business hours. Most staffers are trained to be just as shady as the owners.  Save yourself the trouble and go with a mom & pop especially if this location is on your option list. My experience at this location was a very poor reflection of past experiences with company in other states. Everytime I was there someone was in line complaining-95% of the time there is only 1 staffer 2 service everyone. not sure how they have such high stars. Something is fishy.< /review>

<review>Vanessa has been the most help of every customer service and sales rep that I have had with the public storage companies in the city of Los Angeles, Crenshaw location. Knew what she was doing, accommodated me for prior miscommunications and amazing personality. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be renting.

After having many bad experiences with storage, (those who have experienced marketing tactics coupled with bait & switch, or the additional cleaning fees, processing fees, statement fees, additional insurance etc, ya’all know what I’m talking about!)...I spent hours researching storage online, I decided on a unit that fit my needs and my budget...I was armed with information and a confirmation number and marched in with my demands. I was greeted with a warm welcome and the sweetest smile. RaeLyce was very professional and to my surprise she suggested I view the unit prior to taking my money.  The unit was ideal since i have a disability and needed ground floor access. My bad, it was too tiny once I looked at it. Raelyce spent ten minutes trying to find another unit on the ground floor to no avail.  Instead of offering a unit twice the size for my needs with a kazillion dollar monthly fee, she sought help from a seasoned co-worker Vanessa, Vanessa strolled over with a hospitable smile and said if you give us just a few moments we will do everything we can to make you happy. I noticed it was ten minutes to closing for them and wasn’t expecting these two young woman to do more them discus how to get out on time. I held my breath knowing I was going to get stuck with a house sized unit once they delivered their tag-team sales pitch... to my astonishment, 20 minutes later they rushed back smiling, beads of sweat running down their faces. These woman went above and beyond to help empty and clean a unit that was being vacated as we spoke. It was scheduled to be cleaned the next day.</review>

Hope I had something nice to say about this business and it's location but every month we stop by to check our unit and make a payment and we never leave happy how we arrive. They need to have more than just one person there. One staff member isn't enough. We have called Public Storage directly numerous times to complain about this. Last we were there we we're locked out of their facility with about 10 yes 10others for a good hour, with no one on the premises. After I called and complained, a location manager drove up maybe 20minutes later, never said a word to anyone one of us who obliviously had been waiting to be let in. She just unlocked main doors and went into the lobby. Very unsatisfied with their service.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Vanessa has been the most help of every customer service and sales rep that I have had with the public storage companies in the city of Los Angeles, Crenshaw location. Knew what she was doing, accommodated me for prior miscommunications and amazing personality. If it wasn't for her I wouldn't be renting. Thanks guys!< /Text>

Don't let them fool u that u get $1 first month rent, because it does not happen if you rent near the end of the month you get ripped off. I was told that but when the new month rolled around I was told that I would need to pay full fare. And if you have a problem don't ask for the District mgr( Brett Winslow) because you will receive no help and where do I start, unreasonable, absurd, and down right rude. I would stay away from this Public Storage and very much away from the district manger. There are no lights in each units so you will need to bring your own light.

The sales staff there is great and will help out with anything you need but watch out for Brett< /text>

<rate>2</rate><Review>(Translated by Google) It has many units, in its 8-level building, with access to two elevators, which allow you to access only the level of your unit, take into account that sometimes the elevators will be saturated, The same happens with the use of the devils (wheelbarrows) of the place.
With parking, have even more patience, since due to its location and its lot it only has seven parking spaces for small vehicles. And hopefully a little truck. So do not dare to go with a big truck as you will have many difficulties.
In this place there have already been robberies in units from one to several units at the same time, of which its personnel do not realize the theft until the end of the day, which leaves many doubts with the personnel who were in moment, which were fired or transferred to other warehouses.
So do not have the highest security of your belongings, so refrain from leaving valuables in the place.

Cuenta con muchas unidades, en su edificio de 8 niveles, con acceso a dos elevadores, los cuales te permiten acceder únicamente al nivel de tu unidad, toma en cuenta que algunas ocasiones estarán saturados los elevadores, Lo mismo sucede con el uso a los diablitos(carretillas) del lugar.
Con el parqueo ten aún más paciencia, ya que debido a su ubicación y su lote tan solo cuenta con siete estacionamiento para vehículos pequeños. Y con suerte u  pequeño camión. Así que no te atrevas a ir con camión grande ya que tendrás muchas dificultades.
En este lugar ya se han dado robo en unidades desde una hasta de varias unidades en el mismo momento, del cual su personal no se dan cuenta del robo hasta el final del día, lo cual deja muchas dudas con el personal que se encontraba en es momento, los cuales fueron despedidos o transferidos a otras bodegas.
Así  que no cuentes con la mayor seguridad de tus pertenencias, por lo cual abstente de dejar objetos valiosos en el lugar.</Review>< pics>
