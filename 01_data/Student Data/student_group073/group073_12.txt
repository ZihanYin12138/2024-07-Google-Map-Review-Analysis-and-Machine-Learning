< Review>
I really enjoyed my experience here. It had been quite awhile since I'd had my toes and nails done so got a pedicure and a full set. Both were relaxing and it was so nice just to pamper myself. The staff was nice and seemed eager to help and make you feel comfortable.
I am going back to have Tracy do my nails again.<//Review>

Very clean,organized, and great staff members! Felt really comfortable in the environment I was In. Prices are moderately average like most nails salons I've been too, but this place has a modern interior finish and spacious (so perfect with the COVID-19 mandates) I really recommend!< /text>

They provide great customer service. Fast and friendly. Clean, new, updated salon. If you are looking for a great manicurist then look no further and ask for Peter. He’s the best in town. If you’re looking for some one to make your feet look like new and do an excellent job removing callus and making your feet soft and silky then please ask for Tony. If you want to get your money worth then these two guys are your go to guys here. I have traveled all the way to Vegas to find someone to do a great job on my hands and feet and I cannot think of anyone better than these two guys<//Text>

My new favorite Spa! Always clean, Staff is always professional, and Quality of work is great. I recommend Peter if your going for an acrylic manicure he is polite and will ensure your happy with the results. I asked for a rather complicated manicure and he went above my expectations. Recently went for a fill and wow they looked even more beautiful 😍< /Review>

This is the second time I go to this place & the last. The first time I had a bad experience but I decided to give this place a second chance. The nail tech was rude, she did not understand what I was asking for even though I showed her a pic & frankly what I wanted was simple. She refused to help me find colors that were similar to the pic. She kept complaining about my nails and talking to me in a very rude manner. I hate this place< /review>

I went for the dip powder like I did last time but this time it was not the owner lady who did them. Unfortunately, the nail tech did not seem experienced with dip powder so my nails, are lumpy, bubbly and uneven. Nail shape is almost different on all fingers. I feel bad for saying anything because she was kind and at least she tried. This place is always a hit or miss for me.</review>< rating>

Great location, store, shops & restaurants/bars. But my favorite it the bakery inside Albertson's. Their cake decorator is AMAZING. I asked her to make my son a CheeseSpider cake ( cheeseburger 🍔 spider combo) and it came out perfect</Review>

I stopped at the Market to just by a soda. To my surprise the Market had a small grocery store with a fresh produce area. I did view the prices on several different items they are competitive prices. I also found numerous specialty items for Mexican cuisine.<//Text>

Albertsons, UPS Store, Del Taco and Great Clips are the shops i visit most regularly. I live off Newport and because of the immense traffic conditions there I prefer to drive to this location because it's not as busy and crowded.< /Review>

<review>Steve was incredibly professional and helpful. Set us up with a locksmith and a bunch of other things. Really appreciate the feeling of security with the keypads to go in and out. All in all, I recommend Rancho Mirage Public Storage very highly!< /review>< pics>

Quite clean and well organized, we felt comfortable that our belongings would be secure here. Steve couldn't have been more helpful and polite. Overall it was a very pleasant experience for these first time renters. We would definitely recommend this location to anyone looking for extra storage space.<//Review>

He was so patient and kind to me in one of the worst times of my life. Haven’t to move, hadn’t found a place it’s so difficult. Ray made it so simple and Easy for me. He has a fabulous attitude, he is very efficient and business oriented but yet kind compassionate and just a great guy. Thanks Ray for helping me so much through such a difficult time.

<date>1576528141888< /date><Rating>5</Rating><review>Helping out a loyal customer in a time of need. The local Manager Steve went out of his way to help me when I had no options, I was trying to open up a unit in northern California but per Public Storage's policy you have to be there in person to open a unit. At the location up north that I was trying to open up a new unit, my company already had two units and I have an awesome manager up there as well, but her hands were tied with this policy. The idea was simple, we were trying to open a unit up north, if we could sign for it in person at Steve's location in Rancho Mirage. We called around to a couple difference public storage locations and were pushed away quickly... we were running out of time, having a delivery come the next day we needed this storage unit. Steve did not hesitate to help us find a way, with his help and in contact with my amazing manager up north we were able to get this unit just before closing time.

Steve was very kind, he welcomed us into his office kindly, was a great communicator, and had our full trust and respect within minutes. I wouldn't hesitate to have a unit at this location with how on point he runs that office. My company does work in the Palm Springs area as well, I only wish I knew about this location and its manager sooner I would gladly drive the distance to work with them, and still might over other locations.

Thank you so much Steve, Public Storage is lucky to have you.</review>< pics>

<pictures>None<//pictures><Review>I lost my key last week and Steve helped me find a locksmith because we weren't exactly sure when their District Manager would come to the property. I was able to retrieve my Christmas decor. Steve and Alma do us customers an excellent service, beyond your basic expectations.

People who leave 1 star reviews are people who don't understand what "self storage" means. There are people who own apartment buildings in town, who jack up the rent increases every year, but are somehow surprised that Public Storage does annual increases. Steve and Alma have a policy to protect their business and the customers. I applaud their professionalism, but I also applaud them for going out of their way to help out customers like myself, any way they possibly can.

I also appreciate the cleanliness of the property, the consistent sanitation of the office, and the attention to detail.< /Review>< rate>

Alma and Steve are always helpful, über professional and a joy to visit during these crazy times in our country. Alma's greetings are like a breath of fresh, positive air. She's also very stern with the Public Storage policy. Saw a liberal man get his entitled butt handed to him because he didn't read his contract.

Steve, Alma, and even when Ray was here, this team has always been the greatest. Don't waste your money anywhere else.<//review>

Plus an inspection of the unit I leased; explanations of the lease process; tour of the unit; comprehensive instructions related to lock, key, unit, and gate entry were clear, concise,  and sooooo helpful. All my questions were answered in a polite/courteous manner, which enabled me to make the best decision for the storage of my personal items
Steve is a professional representative, who has a thorough understanding of the various processes and all aspects related leasing a unit. I am so fortunate to have been assisted by this representative of Public Storage,   who is informed, knowledgeable, polite, and courteous. Steve is a compliment to the Public Storage Corporation.< /Review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>Steve was sweet as can be and showed us everything we needed. He made the whole process quick and painless. The air conditioned unit we got for my heirloom cocktail piano was perfect and the last available (lucky us!).

Made a reservation online for a unit at a really good price and stopped at the facility to confirm today....Was greeted by the manager, Steve, who was extremely cordial and professional....I've used storage units periodically over the years, and this was BY FAR, the easiest and most satisfying experience in obtaining and signing up for a unit....
Steve was very thorough in showing me the unit, explaining all the rules and regulations, and in handling the paper work....
Highly,  Highly recommend this location and this manager.....Can't say enough positive things about how I was treated....
Facility was also very clean and tidy, which was nice to see as others I've used had a lot to desire as far as the cleanliness of the facility...
I have always found the Public Storage facilities to be a notch above most other places, and this facility exemplifies that to the max....So glad I found this place for my stuff....< /text>

I am basking in the glorious cleanliness, the really good price, and the total convenience of Public Storage! Josh is literally my Guardian Angel of Storage Needs. He helped me get the very best deal (cheaper than I thought it would be) and advised me on choosing the best sized storage (everything fit perfectly). Josh and Steve are so friendly and polite, and made the whole process of putting things in storage surprisingly pleasant. Over the years, I have interfaced with different storage companies all over California. This Public Storage, in particular, is the absolute cream of the crop.

<review>Steve and Alma in Rancho Mirage and Carlos in
Palm Desert have always given me exceptional service! I will be moving out of my unit this month and I will miss them all terribly! The level of professionalism is A+! I would recommend either
of these public storage locations to anyone.
Great people to deal with, clean units, first class operation. Thanks to all of you!< /review>< pics>

We had an issue with another Public Storage that we could not resolve over the phone.  We went into our local Public Storage and Steve, the manager, was very helpful in helping us to resolve our issue.  It wasn't his responsibility but he was willing to get involved and help us.  When and if we need a local storage ... THIS ONE would be the one we would choose!<//Review>

<Text>Watch for price gouging.  Been there for almost 6 months and received a 23.5% rent increase.  When you you first sign up with them, they force you to take their insurance at a nominal cost along with buying their special over priced locks. The people there are nice, but the business practices are very questionable.  Beware when renting from Public Storage.<//Text>< Pictures>

Steve is great!!! He has helped my sister and I move into 3 different units and each time he makes it easy and quick. We like public storage in rancho mirage because it's secure and the location is convenient. I would highly recommend this company. Call Steve for any of your questions. He will be sure to guide you through the process.</Review>

Steve, the property manager was helpful, informative and pleasant. He was able to provide us not only a perfect locker size but also a pick proof key as well. Good job, Steve.
Looking forward to filling up that locker,  much to my husband's dismay.</Text>

Super awesome place, I've investigated every other storage in the valley & this place was #1. I'm a very picky individual, Tom, the property manager really continuously goes above & beyond to meet my high standards. I'm very satisfied with this air conditioned & clean environment. I will recommend this location to everyone. Month to Month & No contracts.< /text>

I, along with my parents, have been tenants for many years; the location is always clean and spotless. From the day I first toured the location, the staff has been great. Steve, in particular, has been extremely helpful and has provided some of the best customer service I have ever received in retail. I've dealt with other locations but this particular location is, by far, the best. I highly recommend them.< /Text>

This is a great facility. Is really clean, and well maintained. The manager, Steve, was very helpful, answered all my questions, and provided all the information I needed to rent a unit and get started. Was able to get a unit in the climate controlled area too - a great plus in this summer heat! I highly recommend them to all!< /Text>

This is a 5-Star Storage Facility!  We rented two large units in the climate control building. The service is polite and professional.  Steve the manager is incredibly accommodating.  I dare say the buildings are cleaner than some hospitals, it's crazy clean, well lit and feels safe and secure.</Text>

Ive had a storage unit here for about 4 years now (10 X 25).  I just downsized and went to a smaller unit (10 X 15).   This place is about quality, professionalism, and customer service.  The property manager, Steve, is truly an employee that every employer would covet.  The facility is always well-ordered and clean.  The office always smells freshly cleaned and looks as crisp and buttoned up--must have marine sergeant who ensures that the place is in tip top shape.  Easy monthly online payments and invoices.  Steve is the best.  He illustrates excellence in every way.  Thank you.<//Review>

When I make a "reservation" that means I will for sure have the time/unit/seat or whatever it may be that i reserved. We are making a huge move from out of state and I spent 2 weeks searching for the right storage unit because they come and go so quickly. Finally i found the perfect one and we were set (still a month out from move) This morning (3 days before move) i get an email saying my reservation was changed. Okay, ill call and see what the problem is. The man on the phone lets me know its policy that if anybody walks in and wants the storage unit you have "RESERVED" its theirs for the taking. So I asked him what the point of making a reservation was?? (Nothing) We are now 3 days out from a life changing move and completely screwed by public storage. DO NOT HAVE RESERVATIONS IF IT DOESNT ACTUALLY RESERVE ANYTHING. Thanks for screwing us public storage, trying to change our reservation to something completely different than what we reserved doesn't help. You'll never get our business< /text><time>1558460988855<//time>< gmapID>

<review>A few days ago my friend and I walked into this Public Storage facility located in Rancho Mirage and were greeted by a young lady named Alma. As soon as we walked in we noticed how cheerful and happy she was which made us feel welcomed. She provided us with a lot of useful information regarding our storage unit and even suggested places for us to take our son since we are not from the immediate area. After purchasing boxes and other little things we needed, we walked out and my friend and I looked at each other and said the same thing, the employee was super helpful and my friend stated that Alma was always that helpful. We love this place and will use it in future for any package/moving material. Will also like to mention that this location is a lot cleaner than other storage locations we have visited in the past. THANK YOU, ALMA for your welcoming and great customer service.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80db028b87e89b43:0x4eabd909b9794037</gmapID></record>

They are excellent in all areas of service, deportment, and decorum.  They maintain the site in a tremendous fashion and truly understand customer service.  They are wonderful representatives of Public Storage and the industry as a whole.  Thanks from SnowieUSA....< /review>

< Review>
I called the number on the website and was connected with a very pleasant person named Karen who gave me the best deals available and within 1 hour I was on my way to the facility.  I called ahead and let them know I was on my lunch hour and in a hurry and Alejandra was so efficient I was in and out in just minutes.  Access is easy and I'm hoping for a very pleasant leasing experience.<//Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>Could there be a cleaner storage facility? I doubt it! Could there be more professional people than Steve and Alejandra? I doubt it! The staff here are so friendly and knowledgeable about their services. I needed a place to store my toys for the winter and after seeing this place following a morning of storage tours it was a no-brainer. I was given many options and chose those that fitted my needs. The check-in/registration/etc was quick and easy. If you're in the market for storage, give this place a visit, you won't regret it.< /Text><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_name>

<Text>Fantastic facility, Jill was amazing with me after looking at multiple units available decided on a 10X15 Comfort Air Unit. I was amazed on how clean all of the units were that I looked at and how patient and informative Jill remained during my decision process. This facility is monitored and secured well. You wont't be disappointed and you are fortunate enough to see Jill the sign up process will be efficient and quick.Thanks Jill for all of your help.< /Text>< Pictures>

WOW!!! This is a long over-do thank you to the staff at this facility--especially Steve. Extra clean storage units and exceptional service in helping my wife and I transition into a smaller home. He assisted us moving from a large unit, then a smaller unit until our current 5x5 over the past 6 months. Many thanks, Marvin and Debbie< /text>

This is very well maintained facility except for it being overpriced.  We rented a covered RV space less than three years ago for $170/month and just received another outrageous, unjustifiable increase to $230.00 per month.  Don't rent here unless you have unlimited funds.<//Review>

<text>Went to the Palm Springs location looking for  SECURE AND CLEAN site to store our new Airstream. They had no openings but called the Rancho Mirage location and Talked to Steve the manager about a possible opening.  I went over and was immediately impressed with the facility and the manager.  The location could not be any better, less than two miles from my home.
I had viewed over seven facilities and this was the best. The only stress was waiting the few hours to get the confirmation a space would become available.  Like getting your kid in that certain preschool, I was elated when Steve called me with the news I was in!
Thank you Steve, and Public Storage for working together to get the perfect fit.</text>< name>

Made a reservation online a couple weeks ago for a 5'x10'x8' climate-controlled unit and confirmed it over the phone with the manager. My move in date was supposed to be tomorrow 12/31/18. Got a call this morning, 12/30/18, that there was no such unit available and the only size they had was 5'x5'x8'. The manager told me today that they rent units first come first served and a reservation only holds the rate but not an actual unit. Never received a call asking if I still wanted the unit before they gave it to someone else. These guys really screwed me over. I have to move out tomorrow and have no place to put my stuff. Very unprofessional.</Text>

Any time I'm in San Diego I come here at least once.  There food is really good especially there lamb and the hookah is quite flavorful.  The owner(guessing hes the owner) is really nice and gives good recommendations for flavor.  It's a very laid back place reminds me of places we have in Chicago.</text>

I came here for a quick lunch a little before noon. The place was empty. I considered keeping it a secret, but I will share it for the greater good. I had a solid gyro and excellent coffee. I will be back for sure. Check it out!</Review>

< Review>
The food was really good. Med Cafe was highly recommended by a friend.
Stopped in after lunch and was pleasantly surprised to find a huge selection of amazing dishes. I wish i had an option to give some additional stars.
Everybody at this place is helpful and cooperative.< /Review>

<Review>My fiancee, son, and I ate dinner here. I dont remember exactly what they ordered, but they were liking what they ate.  I had the Gyros, very tasty! It was a nice little place and the staff was great!  We've decided to go back periodically.< /Review>< pictures>

The dishes are wonderful whether you have them there or to go, and the staff is always kind. I would highly recommend the chick and lamb plates. I'll update my review regarding the hookah lounge when I have a chance, but I've seen several consistent customers for that sole reason; they must be very pleased.< /Review><time>1538369321846</time></record></dataset><record>
< Review>
Stopped in on a late evening. Surprisingly not may places were open that late.  We ate what the guy taking our order recommend.  Lots of food for the price. The food was fresh and delicious. Would definitely eat there again.  It is also a hooka lounge.</Review>

It's rare I give 5 stars because the food is normally over priced in San Diego, but this place is not. Enjoy it!<//text>< response>

No family friendly, this place is not for kids. so take out orders is better then sitting with your kid at the patio & still people smoking next to you. The food was ok.</Text>

We ordered a side of Fatoush and received a different salad that was the same as what came with the meal for two people. Basmati rice was good, the three kabobs were good (chicken, lamb and kafta) baba ghanouj, hummus. It is difficult to find parking if you just want to pick up. You have to pay for parking downtown.  There were spaces in front of the restaurant for pickup, but they were taken when I arrived. You will have to pay for parking next to the building.<//text>

Best shawarma in CA period. Meat is perfectly cooked and spiced...while all the competitors call their cardboard meat shawarma or gyro.
Same level as Hakosem in Tel Aviv! Get a Laffa at Ta-eem if you are really hungry it will satisfy your hunger.<//text>

Authentic middle eastern food, drink, and of course hookah.

They do things the old school way with wood coals that burn clean and built in ice chambers in their hookahs for a smooth puff from start to finish. I've always been impressed but last night was the first time I've been there since their remodel.

I absolutely love the new decor. It really opened the place up and makes it so much more inviting.

I had the chicken kebab and it was the best I've had (and I've had a lot).

This place is also open late, so it makes for a great after hours spot in Gaslamp. Unlike other hookah spots that try to be clubs, this place is a good mix of energy without the rowdyness.

Long story short, great food, great ambiance, great hookah.< /Text>

Service was awesome! Food was great too! Definitely authentic Mediterranean food is sold here. I had the lamb chop and falafel. Falafel was flavorful while the lamb was really soft and perfect! They have hookahs available but you can only smoke it outside on their patio. Inside, you can lounge around in their seats. The only thing I can say negatively about this place though is its cleanliness. Probably need to have the chairs cleaned or just needed a new set of chairs in general. But overall it was a good experience.  They also have free WiFi to use while you lounge there.<//text>

Food and service are great. I had lamb shish kebob, and omg it was very good.
Update: came here for late dinner about a month ago and found out they accept cash only. I mean, they always accepted debit/credit cards earlier. I don't know what happened, but that was a bad surprise for me. Fortunately, my friend had some cash, but what if no one of us had it? You should tell your guests you accept cash only before you take their order, not after they done with meal. Such a confusing situation. Take one star off because of that.<//review>

Nice chill spot that has some beer, a small outside patio, hookah, and great food. The hummus was really good, and the Greek gyro was so yummy.</text>

My go-to Hookah lounge in San Diego. Also, don't sleep on their food. The food is actually quite good, a chick plate or chicken pita sandwich is what I recommend.<//Text>

<Text>This is one of those restaurants that do not give the best impression when you poke at them inside. But once you are in you will fall in mind that this it is a genuine Lebanese coussine place.Take a look at the variety of dishes they have on their menu .. once you have tried  the first one you  will be convinced that this is probably the very best mediterranean restaurant in the city. I'm serious. Café Med  in Ash St, San Diego is the  best kept secret of Lebanese cuisine in town. Their salads and toppings are always fresh. Their dishes are fabulous and the attention is very fast ... best of all are the prices. Highly recommended. The best Mediterranean restaurant in town.Believe me!!< /Text>< user>

The food was okay but the picture is completely different than what they serve. It is way less than what is supposed to be.</Review>

<review>It's the end of July and the only place we could find open late was The Med Cafe, or a very overcrowded soup place, being from Chicago we were expecting places to be open after 11 pm. Regardless, we were greatly satisfied of our late night eat!<//review><date>1483329081382< /date>< username>

I enjoyed many wonderful meals here, best falafel and Koffta in town rice is always perfect. I'm Egyptian and know quality Middle Eastern Cusine. Their Baba Gou. is spot on, and the Hummus too. Go you won't be sorry. I promise.< /Text>

you have to walk up to the counter to order but super nice staff, they leave a bucjet of coals with the hookahs and great authentic Mediterranean cuisine-falafels, tabouleh, full on dinners.  no frills but THE place to go and chill, especially if youre a local.  6 stars!<//Text>

What we know is that the driver was at your door knocking and called you on the phone and you did not answer. He waited for a while and left.

L.A. Checker Taxicab Company is THE BEST taxi company in the City of Los Angeles area.  All of the drivers are expert precision drivers.  Thank you all  for serving the Southern California area.  Plus, the drivers are so kind, they help carry groceries and carry luggage of passengers.  Thank you and God Bless!</Review>

AMAZING!! Waited for Uber , then waited for Lyft, both companies flaked !!! Yes , flaked! When they saw it’s a short airport trip , they stretched it and never showed up. LA Checker Cab , saved the day! These guys were there in 15 minutes . And I was able to make my flight .  Makes you rethink the whole uber/Lyft idea - and start taking a cab. Taxi service is way more reliable and is still governed by the city . Unlike these rogue uber and Lyft flaksters. LA CHECKER CAB did not disappoint!< /review>

<Response>None<//Response><user_name>Dena Smith<//user_name><review>The driver drove off with my cellphone in the car and me yelling at him to stop. When I contacted the cab company after setting up "found my iphone" with please return to THE ADDRESS YOU DROPPED ME OFF AT. He shut down the phone so I couldn't track it. I called the office, and was told all drivers turn in lost and found at the end of the night. I called back in the morning and was told nobody had turned the phone in or heard from the driver. I called back and said the driver was the airport, and they said he would bring the phone back to the office for pickup tomorrow. I said I would pay to have it brought sooner even though I didn't think I should, and he said "I'll ask the driver if that number is acceptable to him."

The driver was supposed to turn in the phone at the end of shift. At this point he didn't. The Manager began to be rude to me and that's when I realized they were extorting me for money to get my phone back. The driver could've driven it back to the address on the phone but he knew I wouldn't pay him.

The manager told me "the driver doesn't owe you stppping when you're yelling at him. Or answering your phone and calling you back." which is correct. But not returning property that isn't yours is stealing. So i called the cops.< /review><rate>1</rate>< UserId.>

<review>Worst service in LA. I went to Dodgers game and was and got into Checker cab 3425.  Asked to take me to my hotel in El segundo.  As we are leaving the stadium and asked me to pay cash.  I told him I did t have cash and would be paying with a credit card.  Your company states on your website you take cards and your cab has a credit card in rhe back seat.  Guess your drivers just ignore that and request cash.  He said it would be better for him if I pay cash.  I said no I would be paying with a card.  I am here on business and I did have cash but I was expensing it so I am paying with a card.  He then starts hitting the steering wheel and says he is going to drop me downtown and not charge me.  Gee thanks, I am not going to pay when you do not even take me to my destination!  He even says it’s a $20 ride but he won’t charge me.  The meter showed $9.75 so not sure why he even said that.  I said so you are not going to take me to my hote?  He said no and dropped me off downtown across front the World Trade Center.  Then I called an Uber to take me to my hotel in El Segundo.  The driver wanted to commit fraud by getting me to pay cash and cheat your company and when I refuse he just drops me off at some random place downtown when I asked to go to El Segundo.  I will never use your company again and your company should be shut down.</review>< Pictures>

Horrible service. An 7 minute ride is $19. Nobody tells its a flat rate. Why put the meter if then they charge you what ever they want.
Rude drivers. Hope never to use again. Wouldn't open the doors when the discrepancy on the rate came up. In NY you know it's a flat fee.
Scam.</text>

Would never get into a cab with these crazy drivers, I just had one swerve across 3 lanes of traffic cutting me off and forcing me to slam on my brakes and nearly get rear ended, only to have them slow down and realize that it was not the exit he wanted (or he did not want me to get any information off his car to make a complaint against him) and move back into traffic.  Ridiculously unsafe at 65 MPH at 5:30am when visibility is already limited due to darkness.  Thank God nothing happened and I can live to tell the tale and encourage anyone out there to choose a service that will get you there in one piece.< /Text>

<text>I am so furious right now I don't even know how to explain it. I was driving down imperial highway coming for LAX airport and this taxi driver was cutting everyone off. A car on the left lane was going the speed limit and your taxi driver decides he wants to go on the lane of the oncoming traffic just to cut the poor guy off! He kept cutting everyone off, honking at people for going the speed limit and almost made me crash into him because he decided to brake hard because I honked at him. Who ever is in charge of firing workers needs to get rid of this taxi driver before he ends up killing someone on the road for his crazy driving!!!!! His taxi number is #3728 and the last 3 of his license plate is 7L1
Yes I got all his information because something needs to be done about this now!!!!<//text>< Pics>

Prior to getting in the cab we asked the driver how much it would be and he said that he did not know.  The decal on the rate sheet posted in the cab in numerous places states that it is a flat fee of $40 from hotels in West Hollywood to LAX.  We told the driver this numerous times and he said "ok ok"  He still ran the fare meter.  Upon arriving at the airport, he says you owe me $52 which was the amount on his meter, we said the sticker says $40 flat fee and his comment was "I don't know what to tell you, my meter says different rate" and he shrugged his shoulders.  He was so rude about it and would not let us argue the matter.  Worst service ever and very dishonest drivers.  He drove like a maniac and almost rear ended numerous people around us.</review>< pics>

WRIP OFF!  I asked how much the taxi would be form LAX to Hollywood and he said he didn't know the meter would tell him.  Like he has no idea how much it will be???  Then after he starts driving he tells me it's $2.70 a mile but now I'm stuck in the cab and we drive 13 miles to my destination and then he lays me with a bill of $75 the meter said $70.79 or something and at $3 per mile the rate should have been $35.10 which is what I was expecting. UBER charged me $17 to get there.</Text>

<Text>Literally WORST experience ever. Picked up from airport, taken a long route which was more $$. Accidentally left my phone in the car. After multiple calls and attempts to locate the driver, hours later they say they can't find it. My phone was stolen. HATE THIS COMPANY. Will use Uber and Lyft forever.< /Text>< Name>

< Review>
Reminded why I always use Uber/Lyft! -- I decided to use Checker Cab to go back to where I parked from LAX... and was reminded exactly why I always use Uber/Lyft.

I got into the taxi and told the driver where I was going and how to get there.  He argued assuring me there was a different faster route.  After I gave him the address, he acknowledged I was right and took the path I originally proposed.  He then realized it wasn't too far and only then did he tell me there was a $19 minimum (more than double Uber/Lyft).  One we arrive, I go to pay and he gets mad because I didn't tell him I was paying with a credit card (pointing to where it says on small print on a sign on the front windshield I can't read from the back).  He's then trying to say I have to tip him more because I didn't tell him.

All in all, I did arrive safely at my destination, but it cost far more than it should and at every point along the journey there were issues.  No wonder the cab companies are hurting due to Uber/Lyft.  Don't bother with this one--use the apps.</Review>

Cab 3435 was a very dangerous driver. Took me the back way and I was literally scared for the first to
ever in a cab. Then he complained that I was a crappy fare as I  just going to airport hotel and paying by credit card, then he took of with screeching tires. Wish I had read the reviews first. Will never use this service again.<//Review>

Avoid at all cost!!!! I needed a taxi from LAX to a parking garage nearby. The taxi driver was not pleased he got a fare for only a couple of miles, which is a $19 minimum. He was rude and nasty and kept asking why I wouldn't just take the parking shuttle though I explained repeatedly how the shuttle did not come after 45 minutes of waiting. He complained about having to wait 3 hours for a fare at LAX and that we should be taking the shuttle. LAX was packed that night and taxi's were coming and going very quickly, so I am not sure why he would have to wait 3 hours to get a fare. While in the taxi I called LA Checker Cab and told them how their driver was berating me and they said they would call him immediately, something they did not do. The entire ride, the driver would not keep quiet and continued to show his frustration and anger by asking me the same questions. I have never seen anything like it before in my hundreds of taxi's rides in my life around the world.</Review>

<Review>Driver spent entire hour ride on cell phone to other people only stopping to swear and yell at other drivers. I work as a professional driver and this cabbie was terrible. Period. Worse service in LA, then he has the nerve to ask for a tip. If I owned the company he would have been fired.<//Review><Date>1449987408809< /Date><response>None<//response>< user>

<Review>I came in ordered my blonde roast coffee, told me It would be ready in 5 minutes. So I walked around target for a little over 5 minutes came back for my coffee & guess what? It wasn’t ready and while I waited they helped other customers that came after me and I counted every single one that came after me, 7 people got their drink before I did while I sit there still waiting. I get my coffee and this is how I received it. Never coming to this location again.</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMlxGtH6-lAA62FOAQBErHUDTN44cvr27OG2sSH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

<username>Kaylene Fry</username><Date>1535747810506< /Date><rate>1< /rate><text>Worst service that I've ever received at Starbucks. The cashier was very rude when I tried to order something that they didn't have. She would just shake her head. After trying to order 3 different things, she finally said "if you don't see it in there (showcase) we don't have it." So after I had decided on what food I wanted, they completely forgot to warm it up. They served me my drinks, but I sat there for 15 minutes or minutes waiting for my paninis and they didn't even start warming them up. Other customers that ordered after me got their orders first.< /text>< pics>

<time>1552330413539< /time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>1st off - The ladies work as slow as snails whether you are on lunch or not. 2nd - The handmade quesadilla is the size of a long thin taco with hardly any cheese. 3rd- The Nacho fries with meat are skimpy. Not much cheese and not much meat. Plus they had an ugly after taste from being fried in oil thats been used to fry other food. And the fries were not cooked fresh but rather microwaved!!!!! Just dont go and if you do - that's on YOU!!!!!!
Mind you, before this experience  I had given this place 5 stars.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPiGjkzDFuKOnTEDELTtgtWhiPcjmY42MKK3dIj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN3LWu0u2AekxicF-zg_PsDiTgKxcsDanlfPHiY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPrJNrvbDr9NF8DlBmb5twePt_FQY0lSEfoZnt5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMhnhUrUgarZyUjh1CUBvzUKiOLeLctSKdT_MpQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Response>

<Review>This place is trash. Rude staff. If you want some fresh food, check out the mariscos truck called "mariscos el bigoton" its like right around the block. They have the best tostadas.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2cfaf6389335d:0xa4029ee1d9b5d7ec</gmap_id><Rate>1< /Rate><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMGbUmq0KEoK87yvn5hzVJd_F8ov1udzauEKxAl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< UserId.>

<Text>First hand we ordered our food to eat at the same time. We got in in sections plus some of my order wasn't given and the lady at the window is flirting and having a full conversation about her personal life while the other lady in the back trying to do everything on her own. When asked where the rest of the food Was? She said that was it. No lady maybe of you weren't busy talking to that man you would of gotten our order correctly. Too top it off the food wasn't great either...except the pepsi that taste really good. Not recommending anyone.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x80c2cfaf6389335d:0xa4029ee1d9b5d7ec<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>I WILL NEVER EAT HERE! THIS place is run by ignorant people who only serve to people who look a certain way. A poor lady was counting change, and asking how much tortillas cost. She was completely ignored. A customer tried to buy food for her, and that person was REFUSED service because the employee said they were buying it for this lady. The poor lady was outside crying, when the person gave her money to buy food from another place. This place is disgraceful.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

This place is horrible. Cold food, not fresh, and canned. I don't know how this place even has a 4.2 rating??!! Wanted to order a cemita but they didn't have any. Ordered some huaraches and some asada fries. The food was rather cold. These huaraches had canned beans!!! Like common you can't cook some beans??!!! The asada fries were not good as well. They microwaved them!!!! There's this really thin layer of cheese that they had to microwave! Why did they microwave them? Cause the fries weren't freshly fried and the meat wasn't freshly cooked either! The carne asada was dry and pretty flavorless. If I could I wouldn't even give this place a single star. Oh and my mom tried one of their handmade quesadillas and it wasn't good either, it even made her sick. We've had way better quesadillas than that.< /review>

(Translated by Google) The first time I go to eat at this place and the truth is I will not return. I bought a cemita and when I took the first bite it tasted strange and when I opened it I got the smell of rancid oil. I couldn't even eat it because of the smell and taste of rancid oil.

La primera vez llendo a comer a este lugar y y la mera verdad no vuelvo. Yo compre una cemita y cuando le di la primera mordida me supo raro y al abrirla me llego el olor a aceite rancio. Ni lo que me costo ni siquiera me la pude comer por el olor y el sabor a aciete rancio.<//review>

<review>(Translated by Google) The woman who takes the orders is rude, she seems to be in a hurry and the place is empty, my partner asked her which sauce is hotter and she rolled her eyes annoyed, we ordered a burrito and it had no flavor, neither did the quesadilla I ordered cold, no flavor without salt or onion is the second time I buy food here and the truth, I will not return bad service very ugly food.

La mujer que toma las órdenes es grosera, pareciera que tiene mucha prisa y el local está vacío, mi pareja le preguntó cual salsa pica más y voltio los ojos molesta, pedimos un burrito y no tenia nada de sabor tampoco la quesadilla que pedí fria, sin sabor sin sal ni cebolla es la segunda vez que compro comida aquí y la verdad, no regresare mal servicio la comida muy fea.</review>< Time>

< Review>
Had to come back 2 times and still. Once the internet was down. They called me back in a couple days later. Day of I called to see if I could come in earlier and I wasn't even on the schedule. So I got put on the schedule again when I arrived 5 mins early for my appointment. I was given to a different tax agent that I didn't start with and still waited for 15 min past my appointment time, so I grabbed my things and left. Will not be going back<//Review>

Our tax guy who we had an appointment with was out sick and instead of receiving a courtesy call asking if we would like to reschedule we were push off on someone as we were there in the office so we stayed and when we were in the middle of our appointment someone came in and asked to have a page printed and during our appointment time our tax person went ahead and left is sitting there so go take care of that instead of telling that person to wait I am with clients at the moment</Text>

My account has been passed on to a third person in two months and now I can't reach that third person because their email is full and all my messages get returned.   I am exasperated because I live 1500 miles away in Mexico and it doesn't seem to be anyone I can reach for assistance.<//Review>

Dont know much about the supplies here but I had a great experience using the self wash tubs. I only have a small shower at home so $12 to use a tub, shampoo/conditioner, 3 towels, they provide aprons and they have a blow dryer if you want. Raised tub for small dogs and large tubs for medium and large. Nice rubber mat on the bottom so your pup doesn't slip. And a place to clip their collar near the front of the tub.</Review>

First visit to an Unleashed by Perco and we loved it. We took our puppy to try self wash stations. Easy to get our large breed dog in and out, they keep the stations very clean and staff was very helpful.</text>

Nice store, wish they had more everyday items & more doggy clithes for boys. Too many frilly things! Prices aren't too bad either< /text>

The dog wash station is the greatest! Large stainless steel tubs, shampoo, towels, aprons - everything you need to easily wash your dog for only 12 bucks!
Pretty cool.<//Text>

The cashier gal was nice though. She talked to me the whole time when she called the manager over. I don’t remember her name but she had darkish hair and blue eyes. This was a place I came to very often. But after this experience I’m not returning.</Review>< username>

<Text>Have only been there once but the experience as a whole was very good. The staff was very tentative and was very knowledgeable. My dog can be a little bit difficult and i wanted to give him a bath in there self serve dog wash and they were very accommodating. One thing to note is you pay 10 dollars per animal for unlimited time. Its not like Pet food Express where your buying a timed experience.<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rating>5<//Rating><time>1465723588421< /time></record>

Staff is super friendly. Lots of great products. I frequent this store for the self service dog bathing. Reasonably priced at $10. Towels, shampoo, conditioner, and a rubber brush are provided, all you need for a good bath. I bring shampoo from home  as the gentle shampoo provided doesn't clean my dog's thick coat well enough. The hardware is easy to use, the tubs can support risers and allow movement around the tub to reach more easily.  Plus, they do all the clean up!< /review>

<Review>I brought my dog in for the self service dog wash. I have been to many self service places because I do a lot of traveling and my dog always comes along. They don't provide or allow super basic bathing tools - no nail clippers, no ear cleaning solution, no cotton balls. I have never been to a shop that doesn't provide these. The bath was $10 (which is reasonable) but what's the use in going there if I have to buy and bring my own supplies?< /Review>< pics>

<review>Prepaid dog training, had one session and the trainer quit.  It took over two months for them to admit they couldn't get anybody in for a consistent schedule and then I had to go in to have my money refunded (which can be done over the phone).  I'll keep my business with other local stores.< /review>< Rating>

At the corner of First and Harbor.
I was not acknowledged as I entered with my family. It took about 3-5 mins to be helped.  The table we selected needed to be cleaned and sanitized. A lot of transients coming into the establishment some with and others without masks asking for water and quarters to use the restroom. I was eating quickly so that we can leave as I did not feel comfortable here with my family. Use the drive-thru instead and take it to go. I redeemed my accumulated loco points and used the contactless payment terminal with my android google pay. Hoping they take Bitcoin, Dogecoin, or other Crypto payments in the future<//Review>

The worst El pollo loco spot in Orange County 🤦🏽‍♂️ I been coming here for 17 years and over the past few years it’s becoming the worst spot to eat... The cashiers in there have the worst attitude. If you complain they’ll punished you by making wait for more then 30 minutes.... The ingredients are expired most of the time lemon, green hot sauce and cold tortillas... I feel bad because this is my local pollo loco to go to but I won’t be coming here no more ... so much for the 17 years 😢</Review>

They are so focus on having you the least amount of time at the drive thru window that hey ask you to wait somewhere else and they make you wait for really long periods of time. I guess so they can make themselves look better and I heard they have a competition with other pollo Loco locations. Moreover, their employees always have a bad attitude. Especially this girl that takes the orders. I only go here because this is the closest location.< /review>

Not the best Pollo Loco.Seems a little dirty and some lady at drive through is rude.They should have more friendly employees. I ordered a Pollo Bowl which is supposed to be with chicken breast and I got like some gross shredded pieces of chicken. I Will not be back .</text>

<Review>The worst Pollo Loco I have been in. A very stingy atmosphere.  No napkins only a roll of paper towels for the whole store. You need a token to use the restroom. The sauce bar almost empty.

I came here on tuesday nov 10 2020 at about 12:45 pm and the cashier at the drive thru acted as if i forced the money on to her hand...She needs to learn how to receive money the right way instead of trying to make customers feel bad/guilty...</Review>

The service was bad when I ordered, there was hair in my food, and then when I came back for a refund the female manager gave me attitude.

I love El Pollo Loco but I will avoid this location from now on.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

For a restaurant that serves comida mexicana, it didnt really resemble much of its og flavors.... I was dissapointed with the beans, i rate worst kind even compared to the ones in latta.... The chicken was pretty good cant really say the same for the rice tho.... But overall it was an okay meal, staff was okay.</Review>

The crunchy tacos were over fried. - the chicken inside was fried to a crisp.  They seem to be very busy and don't pay attention to details.  Asked for 2 cups of water and got one.  Asked to hold the Pico de Gallo on the salad and forgot.  The double avocado chicken salad was good otherwise.<//text>

While the food was good the service was bloody criminal. Thru the 55 mins it took to make our order (8 pieces of chicken and 2 sides) all most all the customers had to come back to get their order fixed.. and when our buzzer sounded we went to the pick up side where another lady was looking at our order.  Thinking she had ordered the same I asked her if it was hers, she replied it was and then walked out with it.. in full view. Turns out it was ours and then when they made us another one forgot to add corn chips. How hard can it be to make sure your customers get what they paid for. Maybe we just got a bad day.. wasnt full either</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Good service, but the only bad thing is that it is in a ghetto place and there are many lazy and poor people

(Translated by Google) Although we arrived before 10:00 pm, they already had the door closed. They opened us up, and without asking us, they put us food to take away so that we could leave xD. Despite that, we were well looked after, the food was delicious, and the price was quite reasonable. They have the caloric value of each dish in view, so you know what you are eating. There is a great variety of dishes. The mac and cheese are a real treat.

(Original)
Aunque llegamos antes de las 10:00 pm, ya tenían la puerta cerrada. Nos abrieron, y sin preguntarnos, nos pusieron la comida para llevar para que ya nos fuéramos xD. A pesar de eso, nos atendieron bien, la comida estaba deliciosa, y el precio bastante razonable. Tienen el valor calórico de cada platillo a la vista, así que sabes bien lo que te estás comiendo. Hay una gran variedad de platillos. Los macarrones con queso son una verdadera delicia.< /review>

(Translated by Google) To begin 😵😱The worst customer service starting with the MANAYER that is at this time and this day .... very GESTOSA and badly FEELING
It seems that one is going to give you the chicken for FREE .... they are selling a GUACAMOLE DISQUE OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S CALLED
At $ 2.49 plus the tax obviously very expensive and it is but a little bit the GUACAMOLE ...
If it is supposed that they PROMOXIONAN GUACAMOLE, no pieces will be HARD AVOCADO ... we asked that they change it but the disaque said MANAYER THAT THEY ONLY HAD IT SO
AVOCADO PIECES DUROOOOSSS ????
IF THEY ONLY HAVE THAT TO SELL COCHINADAS

OR DEVERIAN TO PUT THAT THEY ARE PIECES OF AVOCADO. DUROSSS NO GUACAMOLE. !! $ ?. 😵😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😎😤😤
SEPARATELY ONE ASKS FOR THE REFUND AND DOES NOT LIKE IT. TO THE DISQUE MANAYER
..
I AM IN MY RIGHT TO COMPLAIN BECAUSE I AM PAYING, THEY DO NOT GIVE IT TO ME FOR FREE .... THEY SHOULD CARE MORE FOR THE CUSTOMER ...

CHICKEN LOCO DE LA FIRST AND HARBOL

(Original)
Para empezar 😵😱El peor servicio al cliente empezando con la MANAYER que esta en este horario y este dia....muy GESTOSA y mal ENCARADA
parece que una va a que le den GRATIS el pollo....estan vendiendo un DISQUE GUACAMOLE O NO SE COMO SE LE LLAME A ESO
A $2.49 mas aparte el tax oviamente carisimo y es pero poquito el GUACAMOLE...dejen ustedes esta durooooo
Si se supone que PROMOXIONAN GUACAMOLE   no pedazos se AGUACATE DUROOO...pedimos que nos lo cambiaran pero dijo la disaque MANAYER QUE SOLO ASI LO TENIAN
PEDAZOSSS DE AGUACATE DUROOOOSSS ????
SI SOLO ESO TIENEN PARA QUE VENDEN COCHINADAS

O DEVERIAN DE PONER QUE SON PEDAZOS DE AGUACATE. DUROSSS NO GUACAMOLE.!!$?.😵😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😎😤😤
APARTE LES PIDE UNO EL REMBOLSO Y NO LE GUSTA. A LA DISQUE MANAYER
..
YO ESTOY EN MI DERECHO DE QUEJARME PORQUE ESTOY PAGANDO NO ME LO DAN GRATIS .... DEVERIAN DE CUIDAR MAS AL CLIENTE ...
