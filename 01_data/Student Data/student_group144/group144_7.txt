We started with their house salad, one order and we share but i ate 3/4 of it. I ordered the seafood linguine.  By the time she served the dish to our table, the dish smells good, looks delicious and taste amazing. Definitely going back there again.<//Text>

Just moved into the area and stumbled upon this place. It's a very hole in the wall in a strip shopping center but delicious food. We tried gnocchi with with the special Pietro sauce and it was freaking amazing. We also had lasagna and pizza. Everything was delicious. We met the owner Pietro and his son Luciano was our server. Super sweet people and they have been there 42 years! We Def found our new favorite Italian place!</text>

<Text>What can I say? This is, hands down, the best Italian food and pizza in San Diego! As one who grew up in northern New Jersey, I am very picky about my Italian food and pizza. This place reminds me of back home and it starts with the aroma the moment you step in the door. Tucked in the corner of a tiny La Mesa strip mall, you could be forgiven for not noticing it. However, once you go, you’re hooked. There’s simply no place like it in the area and, believe me, I’ve searched in the past few decades I’ve lived in San Diego. The owner, Pietro, is present almost every night and runs a great staff who make you feel at home. His son, Luciano, is incredibly friendly and adds to the family feel. We discovered the joint nearly 4 years ago and eat here or order pickup nearly every single week. With a wide variety of pastas and the best pizza west of north Jersey, there’s something for everyone. Even our picky son loves everything here. When a baby, Pietro, himself, used to come out and personally cut up meatballs for our son. Very family friendly. The last restaurant of a dying breed, we hope they stick around forever! Do yourself a favor, and help keep small local businesses around during three tough times...check them out!< /Text><Name>Rali Schwartz< /Name>< response>

Great place to visit for Italian comfort home cooked food! Prices very reasonable, food is amazing, service staff all very genuine and sincere. Must visit! Their white clam linguine* and portobello ravioli was amazing! The bread that came with the food was even more amazing. I could eat that all day! So fresh and crispy on the outside, fragrant and soft on the inside. 👍🏻< /Text>

<Text>I love all kinds of pizza and the places that make them. Like the inexpensive Little Caesar's to the filling kinds like New York Giant. However, if I want a truly authentic pizza made by a warm hearted passionate Italian, then I will always go to Pietro's. Seriously, with your first bite of pizza, you notice perfection in the ingredients and this amazing balance of each layer. Like how he can have this thin layer of sauce, not too wet or dry, and have it be the perfect amount. Also, where I could carb out on other pizzas, two slices of Pietro's pizza fills me up for less money than I would pay at another place. I think this is because Pietro's pizza crust is more authentic and not just bread.<//Text>< rate>

I had never heard of this place before, went here to celebrate an occasion with my wife and the in-laws. The servers were very polite and helpful. I ordered the fettuccine alfredo and it tasted great. Pietro himself came out and spoke to us briefly. He shared to us about the joy he gets from preparing food.
Times are tough for all restaurants, but if you are in the area and want some Italian some, this place is one to check out.</Text>

<rating>3<//rating><review>It's been around a while. Decided to get a pizza, thinking that I haven't had one from there in years. In short- 1st class ingredients with poor execution. When I opened the box, it looked my pizza survived an earthquake in the oven. All the bell peppers we're on one side, meat in another section,etc... You can tell it was NOT from the car ride. It was plain sloppy  topping distribution. Your milage may vary.<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Pleasantly surprised, super good food and friendly service.
I had Eggplant Siciliana which was very good so good I ate the entire meal like a pig.
My bf had Pollo Tascano he was super happy with his choice and insisted I have a taste. I don't like mushrooms so he scraped them off for me to try the chicken and let me tell you that chicken was amazing.
Both dishes came with a nice salad or you can get soup and they also came with garlic bread.
We live in north county or we would go back several times a month. We can't wait to go back and stuff ourselves in the future.🙂
They serve Coke products for soda.</Review>< date>

<Text>It's in the corner of a strip mall where you could be right in front of it and not notice it was there.  But the interior is lovely with a mix of tables and booths, tasteful paintings of Italian cities, and a calm atmosphere.  They can easily handle large parties.
Food is great.  A wide choice of pasta dishes as well as traditional chicken and veal entrees.  Many varieties of pizza - they all looked delicious.< /Text><time>1569728060105<//time>< gmap_id>

Best family Italian Restaurant we know of. Pietro has been a staple in the La Mesa area since the '70's. He himself is there virtually every day and never forgets a face. Took my Father-in-law there today and he recognized him immediately after over 12 years. The Pizza and Pasta are second to no one! Enjoy!< /Text>

The owner is on hand most nights to greet you at your table, and the food is excellent.  The price is very fair for what you are getting, and the service is always spot on.  This is not a fancy place, but it's not a pizza shack either... very comfortable surroundings and usually a nice quiet atmosphere.  My wife and I visit a couple times a month.

Where do I begin? This ristorante reminds me of the old school NY/NJ places I ate at when I was a teen back in the 90’s! People, if you’re looking for high quality authentic Italian food...go see Pietro.
His staff is wonderful....totally on top of everything. Sebina, one of his servers, is the creme de la creme! She worked for another fabulous Italian ristorante in North Park and understands the concept of making the customer feel like a VIP.
THE FOOD....OMG. I’ve never been to Italy, although it’s on my bucket list, but if the food tastes anything like it does here....I’d never return to the US.
This restaurant is what YOU make of it. If you can’t see past the “it must be a franchise to be good” idea head over to Rubios across the street.< /text>

Everything we have had is delicious (the white pesto pasta is our favorite) and the service is excellent. They treat you like family and seem genuinely happy to have you as a guest, any time. Highly recommend! You won't regret it!</review>< pictures>

I am saddened, and also simultaneously glad that this place is tucked away somewhat - It's really good and would easily get overcrowded otherwise. The owner himself is involved with customer satisfaction, and the business' food and atmosphere reflects this effort. Love restaurants that hold to their theming without overdoing it. Solid pricing, delicious food, will definitely be coming back.</review>

This place is so authentic that the cab driver we had in Italy literally brought up Pietro when he heard we lived in La Mesa.  That's right, our cab driver IN ITALY knew Pietro.

We have been coming here for years for their delicious pizza.  We are pizza snobs and have been ALL around east county, and Pietro's is BY FAR the best pizza place in town.  The service is also amazing, and Pietro and his staff are all very friendly.  I have no clue where the reviewer above actually went where their "pizza tasted like cardboard" but it can't have been here.< /text>

I really enjoyed this restaurant. My wife and went here on our anniversary, and we couldn't find an Italian restaurant that wasn't the Olive Garden. This place is pretty small, but fits quite a few people very comfortably. I can't remember which pasta dish I ordered, but I remember it was amazing! I just asked the waitress "what is your most popular pasta dish?" and she brought it. The salad was very good too, we were able to share it before our main dish arrived.< /Text>

The only reason we decided to try this place was due to the outstanding reviews. We ordered 2 pizzas to go and it cost $40. The owner made it out to be like it was an authentic, classy, Italian fine dining restaurant. It literally tasted like cardboard with plastic cheese. We were so disappointed; DiGiorno’s pizza would have been A LOT better!<//Text>

<Time>1439995372402< /Time><Review>Via looking on the online-menu: I was interested to be a '1st-time customer.'
But "Pietro's Cucina Italiana" found as an eatery that be charging for "extra sauce" on the pizza.
That I won't accept, from any business, as "extra charge" applies to those customers who want 'extra cheese.'
I perceived the same, but in coincidence what another reviewer says: that this business prices on the of 'positive reviews' it gets. As I rather say the amount of positive reviews that it gets.
I rather stay where I been enjoying to go, all along: as there be more sizes of pizza, and no extra charge for "extra sauce."  Add that I already know the taste of their sauce & am assured to like it. Rather than risk a more expensive business.< /Review><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

Can't believe I've lived in EC/La Mesa for 8 years and just discovered this place. My wife has lived in this area  on and off for 27 years and didn't know of it. This place is a hidden Gem. The food is excellent, the staff is off the charts friendly and makes you feel like you're with family. I grew up in Boston area and this place reminds me of going over to my Grand parents after church on Sunday. The owner Pietro  comes to your table and strikes up conversations, his son Luciano  also has a great personality and is an excellent waiter. BTW my wife told her daughter when we got home Luciano is "hot"!
All and all our 1st time here but definitely not our last.< /review>

This is literally some of the best pizza I've had in the San Diego area. It's cheap and delicious. Coming from New York this stands up well to New York pizzas. I'll be back for sure!<//Text>

I really like this place, obviously. Let me start by saying from the outside it is fairly understated, tucked into the corner of a strip mall in La Mesa. Walk in and you are warmly-welcomed, often times by the Maestro himself. The décor is fairly standard Italian-themed restaurant, but the atmosphere is jovial and welcoming. I have tried the Gnocchi, the Lasagna, the Spinach Ravioli, and of course the Pizza. All are excellent! Give this place a try if you are in La Mesa and I guarantee you will be back for more. The only complaint I have is that I lived here for three years before I happened upon it by shear luck! Enjoy!</text>

Very good food. The waiters and staff are very nice as well, making the atmosphere far more comfortable. The decor is well done with a slightly lower lighting, making you feel comfortable as soon as you sit down.< /Review>

Pietro is the hands on owner and his cuieina is spot on. Pizza is a staple learned in Italy and only slightly modified by America. Pastas are traditional and true to the Italian Homeland. I love the Ravioli and Pizza with Anchovies, Tomatoes, and Olives. Either with Chianti, yesssss.< /review>

<review>This place is wonderful. We had the best food server and meal. The penne pasta with the white pesto sauce was wonderful but the portobello raviolis with the Pietro sauce was the absolute best.

<Review>Pietro's is superv dinning...can't have enough of Pietro's Salad and  my always favorite artichoke pizza, if your lucky enough you can get treated to personal entertaining by Mr. Pietro himself who you might not know has a very extensive repertuor of jokes on hand.....and he can hold his own.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< GmapID>

Just found this little place. It's easy to miss from the street, but once you're inside it's a charming little place where the wait staff is extremely friendly and everything we tried on the menu was excellent.< /review>

This is one of those few places that brings me back to the great local Italian places that I loved while growing up back East.  Pietro is very much a 'hands on' owner/chef.  Well worth going back too on a regular basis, even if it isn't the least expensive place to eat..<//review>

I don't live there I do pick up lots of customers there. I would not want to live there. Most
Customers don't have to many bad things to say. So I'm happy for anyone who lives there just not for me.<//Review>

Lots of Stray cats roaming around for someone being allergic to cats makes it difficult to want to move in. I also have a older brother who lives here and wanting to come visit him is a hassle there is never any parking cause the occupants are moving there cars in where the visitor parking is. They should suggest maybe improving the whole situation.<//text>

Nice park, amenities, friendly management.  Gym swimming pools, jacuzzi, and saunas.  High space rent though.<//Text>

<Text>It is a pretty good place. We have good neighbors that are nice and friendly. A couple of times riff raff moved in but they didn't stay long. We were not used to living in close quarters and had to adjust to our surroundings. But I would say living here has been a pretty good experience. Most of the kids I have seen have been very nice and polite. Yes they do hang out in front of the clubhouse but hey...they are teens. It is better hanging out talking and having fun than off getting in trouble (and no I don't have teens my children are grown).  I do get frustrated at the little kids not being watched. They do get in the road and I am so afraid they will get hurt. I may just live on a good street.  I haven't heard a lot noise and disturbances. My father lives with us and being from the south he has to socialize and speak to everyone that passes by. He has everyone looking to see if he is outside so they can say hi. He has made many friends. He really enjoys the people here.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

If you could stop turning the water off without notice that'd be great. One flyer on a mailbox I don't even live near isn't enough of a heads up. Thanks for always ruining my work days with your inability to fix whatever water problem is going on every freaking month. I just loooooove paying almost 2k a month to not even be able to SHOWER FOR WORK.<//Review>

I came to look around about a month back they have a strict no parking rule infront of house spaces no matter if you know the person the place is filled with “red line” to not park and you will get towed away, what if someone has guests one day ?<//text>

Perfect place to wash your vehicle, do a detailed clean without  feeling like your at grand central although it does get pretty busy at times . It used to have a drive through little store on property which was so cool and truly missed. Now it has a smoke shop where you can buy your cigarettes, get something to drink,a snack or whatever. Its one of those places that you wouldn't know was there, unless someone told/showed you or you been there before.< /text></record>

<username>Sam<//username><Review>I used my debit card, as usual to wash my car.  Halfway through rinsing my car off, the spray just stopped.  I went to the control box to investigate, and the timer was still ticking away.  I tried all the controls, and nothing worked.  I stopped the timer, and realized the other bays were still working.  I inserted my debit card and tried to start the rinse up again, but nothing.  Still nothing worked, even though the timer was again running.  Nothing at all, completely dead, but charging my account.  I tried to stop the timer again, but it has a four minute minimum.  So it continues ticking away, charging while refusing to run.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<review>(Edited Review) My mistake, apparently there is a precharge for using debit or credit on the machine (kind of like gasoline pumps). I did receive my money back, so be aware of the $15 charge in your bank account (which can make you overdraft). I will still rate this place 3 stars though since it isn’t really beginner friendly with so many signs scattered all around, it’s difficult to be sure what to do or not to do. Like I said, it’s better to use coins than using debit or credit. However, overall, good place to go to hand wash your own car.
————————————
(Original Review) Good car wash, but don’t use your credit or debit. I used my debit card and as charged $15, twice! The $4 was for the vacuum (still pretty expensive by card). The wash machine said I used it for $6 and clicked the stop button. Never using my card again. Coins is cheaper and will get charged less. I would ask for a refund if I knew how, but it sounds like such a hassle. Lesson learned and learn from my mistake.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>{'time': 1606104294715, 'text': 'No you were not charged $15, twice. As posted on the paystation. A $15 Pre_Authorzation will happen each time you swipe your card. When the pending goes away it will be what it said on the screen when you push stop.'}</response>< GmapID>

So this is the best place that I so far have used to wash my ride. Makes my Stella (1991 740 Volvo Estate) clean af. Clean, lots of options and a convenient store on site. 3 dollars for 5 min. 1.25 for the vacuums. Good stuff< /text>

My go-to self service car wash, even though I drive 30 minutes from home/work. It’s the BEST Self Service Car Wash compared to others I used in Chula Vista, National City, El Cajon, Lemon Grove, Spring Valley, & other parts of San Diego.<//Text>

This is a great place to give you car a really good wash. You can pay with your card for both vaccums and car wash. No need to worry about getting quarters.< /text>

<review>Always wash the car here when in the area. Wish it was more like $1.50-$2.00 instead of $3.00 for 4 minutes. I just came back from Louisiana where I paid $1 for 6 minutes at a self service wash with all the same amenities.🤷🏽‍♂️< /review><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None< /response>< gmap_id>

<Review>Easy, they have a card reader that counts you your time upward instead if you use the credit card. It allows you to not keep guessing how many coins to put in. Equipment was in great shape and the owner was there constantly cleaning the stalls afterwards.< /Review><UserId.>118180098074660377780< /UserId.><Rate>5<//Rate><GmapID>0x80d951be0342acb1:0x6102c14cc7dcd182< /GmapID><Pics>None< /Pics></record>

<review>I was here on 1/2/2019 with my son. It was my first visit and I wasn't sure what to expect. There are lots of options for different sprays, soaps and such. The bay was reasonably clean. I spent about the same as I would spend for a gas station auto car wash but felt like I received a better quality wash as I was able to clean the way I like to clean. I would recommend and I would go there again.</review><date>1578342499333</date><user_name>Erik Price< /user_name>< response>

Great place to wash your car. But BE CAREFUL!  if you aren't monitoring your time, you could easily spend $15. I’ve been going here for a while and I found that the other soaps and stuff don’t really work well for me. (Not saying it’s bad) I spend about $4-5 for a wash. I just use the high pressure soap and then a high pressure rinse. I’d say 4 mins tops.

Their soaps are really soapy so they make you spend longer to wash it off.< /review>

<Review>Great car wash.  If you want a self-service car wash and in the area, this is the best.  I will be back.  The soap and rinse and dryer are perfect.  There are plenty of stalls and plenty of vacuums.  It is awes that they offer a card option cause I hate running around the car with quarters in my pocket.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Great car wash , was in and out quick , has a card reader which is great , only thing that's weird is location, the entrance/exit is on a down hill which for low cars is a bit difficult to navigate , but not impossible I did hahaha, also there's a weird barrier all the way around the property kinda like a worn down speed bump , don't know what that's about but yeah definitely weird</review>

Is what it says it is—a self-service car wash. Nice way to quickly and cheaply spruce up your car. I wish more of these existed and fewer of the “detailing” places that do a half-assed job and charge an arm and a leg.</text>

Careful if you use you're debit card. I did a $3.02 car wash an it charged my card for $15 !! I don't even use that much to wash my full size dually. Straight rip off.! Check you're bank transaction after.< /Review>

<Text>Spoke with costomer service first. Nice gentleman answered the phone and informed me of the pricing and busy time. Great place vacumes had great good suction and clean heads. Not the jacked up style heads that ruin your seats. The wash stations were very versitle with the washing heads brush and blower dryers. And a multiple option dwitch that lets you clean untill your are done before shutting off. The sprayer heads were great but when switching between soaps or chemicals let the wand or sprayer spray to the drain for a few seconds so the last chemical can flush out. Noticed this when i first went to rince off the car and soap was still comeing out of the power head. The foam brush also was s pleasure to use i was impress on how much foam came out and i practically made my car into a giant foam bubble. The dryer was decently powerfull but the head on it was a hard plastic. Maby they could swap out the tip on it for a softter rubber to help from accidents. But over all great self service carwash i look fowards to useing it again. The other local ones like pearl cannot compare to this location<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Although the site is older and does not look like the Hilton - all the equipment is state of-the-art and the wash bays and vacuum areas are clean and inviting. Thank you Happy Cow!</Text>

< Review>
Use brushes at your own risk. I am not sure if they scratched my car, but it is possible. I had a lot of marks I never noticed before. Also, one of the options did not work (one of the soap options.) I believe it was a super soap option, or high pressure soap. Only water came out. 3 dollars for four minutes. If I went back, I would do a "touchless," definitely not using the brush. I even rinsed the brush off a lot before. But that pressure soap was broken soo... And it did not do a very good job getting those little yellow dots out. Had to use my finger. So all in all not pleasant. Annnd the floor gets all wet, then you have to get in your car yiu just washed. The vacs are 1.50 dollars for 4 minutes. But the heads are very dirty. I would not use on cloth seats, only floors. Lots and lots of dust on heads.< /Review>

< Review>
I’ve been doing my taxes with Traci for years and she always makes sure my taxes are accurate and she very knowledgeable. I have not ever had an issue w the IRS doing my taxes with her. I’ve been to other places and a year later I’ll receive a letter from the IRS saying I owe. I truly trust Traci because she knows what’s she’s doing. I just started using her app and it made it so easy to do my taxes because it’s paperless. We did my taxes via the app and spoke to her over the phone. I am always happy with my refund when I go with Traci.

Thank you Traci!!< /Review>

I’ve been coming to Traci during tax season for years now, at my Mom’s recommendation. And boy, am I glad I did. Not only does she always have amazing news for me and tries to do everything in her power to make sure my family and I receive every bit of money owed to us but when I come in to see her it’s always a very enjoyable experience. Even this year, with the app submitted documents and phone conversation vs. in person we had a great time talking to her and it was VERY easy and convenient. There were literally zero issues. There is no one else I’d go to. She is THE best.</text>

<review>The Tax Station is a great place to get your taxes done. Ask for Traci! She made sure I was well informed each step of the way, and reassured me not to be nervous when it comes to doing your taxes. She was very proficient with getting all my information through and will always follow up with you. Awesome customer service. She is funny and very personable. Highly recommend.</review>< pics>

I love Traci and The Tax Station! She's thorough and detailed and makes doing your taxes a breeze (which is amazing because I hate doing them and I always wait until the last minute but Traci gets it done so quick!). I especially love the new app cuz it makes it so easy and I don't have to drive anywhere! Moreover, Traci cares about you and always makes time to catch up and actually take an interest in your life - I love our little mini therapy sessions. Thanks Traci for all you do!< /Text>

<text>Traci is simply the best! She’s so insightful and so sweet. She’s been doing mine and my family’s taxes for years and has never disappointed. She gets you in and out in no time. The new format( due to covid) is very easy, and you get the same quality. Although I definitely miss seeing her in person. If you need your taxes done Traci and The Tax Station is the way to go. 💜< /text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1618463775563, 'text': 'Aunjanae thanks so much for your review.

<text>I’ve been getting my taxes done with Traci at The Tax Station for probably eight years now. I refuse to go to anyone else. She’s super prompt to answering questions, very intelligent, has a great personality and gets things done so fast. I literally blink and my return is in my bank account. It’s like magic. The whole process is always so smooth. I love how she even checks in on me from time to time throughout the year. I highly recommend!< /text>< user_id>

I have been going to Traci for my tax needs for over 10 years. Traci cares about her clients and provides great guidance relating to your tax needs. The process during COVID has become even easier because you can upload your docs using a secure app so you can get your taxes done while staying safe.< /Review>

My family has been going to Ms. Thompson for a couple of years now for tax services. The key thing is that we always experience is consistency. She is consistent, flexible, informative, thorough, and contains the patience to explain matters in detail that are complicated. Will continue to go to her in which I have the confidence and are reassured that my documents, files, and paperwork are handled correctly and effeciently.<//text>

Traci at The Tax Station  is AMAZING! I have been her client for over 10 years and couldn't imagine going anywhere else. She is fast and efficient and truly cares about ALL of her clients.  I missed seeing her this year in person, but with the pandemic she is serving her clients remotely and she was just as quick  and did a fantastic job! I highly recommend her for preparing your taxes.<//Review>

<Text>I have been using Traci for my taxes for the past 5 years and I have been more than happy with her service. She is prompt, respectful, and excellent at communicating throughout the entire process. I could not imagine filing my taxes anywhere else because of the customer service and attention to detail that Traci provides to her clients. Traci is the best in the business!</Text><Time>1613959653726< /Time><GmapID>0x80dd3370e7ae7eff:0x9d2286bbaa7b25ec<//GmapID>< Rate>

<Review>Tracy is the best she has been my "tax lady" for at least 10 years now and I highly recommend her. She is professional, works to get all your credits and write off's due you, and most important for me is her bubbly personality. Tracy is welcoming making you feel like one of the family. The Tax Station LLC is the go to for all your tax needs. Also she does real estate and will assist in all your home needs.< /Review>< Pics>

Tax season can be a very apprehensive time of the year for most! But I can say honestly say, I enjoy it because Traci is just so personable and fun to talk to AND she knows her stuff! A lot of ppl around me suggested the turbo tax option and how easy it is but it’s worth it to go to a professional that knows tax laws and what tax credits you qualify for to really maximize your return. Thank you Traci and Tax Station!<//review>

I HIGHLY recommend this biz for all your tax needs! Traci is responsive and caring, which is so refreshing when working on something that is so confusing to me. I used to cry when I had to do my taxes, and now I look forward to them after going to the Tax Station. Been going for 10+ years now :) Do it. You will not be disappointed.<//Review>

<Text>I’ve been going to Traci at The Tax Station since 2011! Traci has always communicated clearly and promptly when it comes to getting my taxes done. I can’t imagine going to anyone else for my tax needs and I will continue he to do so especially after seeing how much more she’s willing to go above and beyond for her customers now during COVID. She offers her help any day of the week and makes the interaction very personalized (it’s a big part of why I keep coming back).< /Text><gmapID>0x80dd3370e7ae7eff:0x9d2286bbaa7b25ec<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I highly recommend this company . They are my third marketing company . Initially hired them for improved in SEO and to help with my reviews. Within my two weeks of hiring them and launching the website my ranking doubled in a very competitive market . I was hesitant about starting the digital marketing with them but once I did and saw the results of all their work i have decided to increase my budget . They were transparent from day one . Ashley and Andy are great and have responded quickly to all my concerns and request. Their platform allowed me to see the traffic into my website and that alone gave me an insight into where I should put my efforts and money . Highly recommend .< /text>

I hired PatientGain to build and manage my website and I am thrilled with their work.  They built a beautiful informative website for my acne studio.  Since my website went live I have had a steady stream of new clients that  chose my business after looking at other sites.

Brooke my account manager is very knowledgeable and helpful.  She is quick to respond to any request I have.  My experience with PatientGain has been wonderful thus far and I look forward to working with them for years to come.< /review>

We've been with PatientGain for about two years.  It has made managing our website, contacts, social media, and leads easier and more productive.  Their pricing is very reasonable for what they provide.  Also, our account manager, Courtney is great.  When we need assistance, she is very responsive. I definitely recommend PatientGain.<//Review>

She has the best personality for this business. Very quick and responsive. Sy is amazing ! He is so fast at getting whatever I need done in more than a timely manner ! I am totally impressed with this company, the dashboard is simple and user friendly. The help with GOOGLE was on POINT !

I have been in private practice for 14 years and this was the best decision I made 3 years ago. I joined the patient gain community. Since then my patient population has increased , now I have 2 offices. They update my website very often and they understand how google works. They assign an advisor for you and check how you are doing every month. Courtney is my current advisor and she is the best, very responsive to my every request and she keeps us updated with current trends. You will not go wrong in joining this community.< /review>

PatientGain is such a great asset to my business, they have made everything easier and far more productive and professional.
Courtney is so easy to work with and takes her work very serious, yet is very patient and kind with me with any questions or concerns that may arise.
Overall I have far less stress over my practice and my online social media presence.
Great job PatientGain Team💋</text>

This team listens very well to what the client 's objectives are and transforms them into a beautiful product.  I had a  previous website that looked great, but did not perform well. The team not only helped me understand what was not working in the old scenario but went on to develop a website that had features that I never imaged existed.  They were very patient with me as I made changes and meandered about until I saw what I liked. This team really knows what they are doing.</review>

PatientGain has been incredible to work with while transforming our website to be more SEO appropriate and for the reputation management portion of our agreement.  Ashley O., our account manager, is so patient and kind and a pleasure to work with.  I love how easy it is to communicate and book a zoom appointment when I need help or clarification.  We will be expanding PatientGain to our other practices very soon!<//review>

The Patient Gain Team is absolutely amazing!!! Our account Manager Cheryl and her Team are the absolute best.  Cheryl makes you feel like your account and success is important thing in every interaction.  They are incredibly responsive and do not stop until the job is done to our satisfaction.  More importantly, they have helped us achieve tremendous results in a relatively short period of time.  If I could give them 10 Stars I would!!!<//Text>

<Review>My sincere recommendation is Five Stars for Cheryl Nimz and Sy Shah, our Project Manager and Support Manager at PatientGain.
Sy and Cheryl have been so easy to contact and work with, it's amazing!
Together, our ideas have refreshed and modernized our PrimeCare Urgent Care website.
Patient engagement, informational learning and topical Blog postings are all part of the equation, that's made our medical website a hit.
Thanks to PatientGain!</Review>< userid>

Patient Gain is amazing! They have made a huge impact in our business.

I do my research thoroughly.

We were looking for a reputable company for marketing solutions and it seemed as if every place spent more time on their own marketing than their clients.

Patient gain has been the exception to this. They feature a whole team of outstanding Experts who have quick solutions to any Seo/marketing issues.

We are lucky to have Jennifer as our account manager! She is awesome. Always positive and you can tell she has concern to get the job done. It’s important to trust the people you work with, and at this point she is def a Huge Part of our team.

Being nice is great, but the results are what matter in the end, and they have been delivering.

A big Thank you to Jennifer, Sal & the whole PG Team!!< /Review>

Cheryl and Sy continuously go above and beyond to help our clinic with our website and marketing needs. When we need to make changes, they are very responsive and get it taken care of right away. Our urgent care clinic is constantly busy with Covid-19 testing, and they have helped us tremendously along the way making our website easy for our patients to navigate. Well done, Cheryl, Sy and all the great people at PatientGain!</Text>

<text>Dear PatinentGain,
Firstly, I wanted to take a moment to personally review your services. I feel very thankful for being your customer.
I am giving this review with utmost delight. This group of people know what they are doing, and they are very, very professional.
I am a solo practitioner. I was looking into different options to improve my digital marketing. The competition in my area is fierce. In that quest I kissed many frogs until one day I bumped into PatientGain.
From the very first day I was impressed. The person that explained the program to me was so knowledgeable and so professional in his delivery! I was trying to ask loaded question, I was trying to “get them”, remember I was coming from bad experiences, but that guy was all professionalism. I was impressed.
Then came the onboarding. It was so easy and accommodating. I was ever more impressed if that was possible, then the crown of the jewel appeared! My private and personally assigned project manager! Her Name is Miss Ohr. In Hebrew “Ohr” means light, in Spanish that name sounds like “Oro” which means gold. Can I say more?!
I have stricken the pile of Ohr! I feel I hit the end of the rainbow when I met this people, after my prior sad quest for digital marketing of my private practice.
Those who hear private practice and get goose bumps know perfectly what it is and what it takes. But after I signed up with PatientGain, I feel armored!
They have 5 stars! Miss Ohr, Raheel, the rest of the team. Thank you, guys, for your excellent work!
Thank you, Miss Ohr, for your excellent representation of your company.
I am extremely grateful for you to be working on my account.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1606963793774, 'text': 'Thank you doctor!!!\nWe get a lot of good feedback about our staff and service.\nBut one is worth  a BIG THANK YOU !!!\nAnd it deserves to be framed in my office.

< Review>
Thank you Patient Gain, my project manager and the marketing team for doing such an amazing job on the website. The pricing (very competitive), content, and website development was an easy, seamless process. The first time I saw the completed website I was in awe. I couldn't believe they took my ideas and turned it into this amazing website that reflects my business. My project manager has been there for me every single step of the way. I can call, email or text her. We recently had to make some changes to the business and update the website and Facebook and my project manager and her team worked non-stop, even through the weekend to get the updates completed and the website re-launched. Don't be fooled by other competitors. You won't regret your decision to use patient gain for your website/marketing needs.</Review>

Patientgain is a one stop shop for all marketing needs of a medical clinic. They have a team of caring customer care experts who know how important is to take care of the needs of the customers as soon as possible. Patientgain keeps adding new features based on the needs of the market which is another reason I gave them a five star review.< /Review>

I have been working with PatientGain for more than 5 years. They host my websites, manage my PPC campaigns and also work to optimize my SEO efforts. They have helped me continually improve our online marketing programs to grow our revenues build our business to 7 locations. Courtney has taken on the role of key contact with our organization this year and has been very efficient with very quick response times and great follow up. I would recommend PatientGain to anyone looking for a good marketing partner to help grow their business through online marketing.<//Review>

These guys are horrendous. They lure you in as a customer but when you decide to leave they provide you no assistance whatsoever.  We decided to use another platform for marketing and wanted assistance in removing them from our FaceBook Appointment section.  Before reaching out to them I tried everything to remove them, as a last resort, I reached out to them for help and got a cold shoulder. Stay AWAy!</Review>

We love working with PatientGain! There are so many companies that offer web development and marketing, but they are most certainly not the same. PG is reliable, and they deliver on their promises, with no funny business.

Our PatientGain account manager is Courtney, and we are happy to have her because she is excellent. Being kind is a great attribute, but as a medical business owner, I prefer someone who gets the job done (quick & correct), Courtney is Both. Thank you so much to the PatientGain Team & Courtney for your dedication to our success, we are grateful for everything you do.< /Review>

We have used Patient Gain for about 4 years in all of our 12 locations. They have done an amazing job. A majority of calls and new patients come from their advertising and search engine optimization. The staff is excellent as well--it has been great working with Marci, Salem and Nancy. I have used multiple marketing companies and Patient Gain has been the best by far.< /Review>

PatientGain has been instrumental in taking our online marketing strategy to the next level. The amount of applications that their platform ties together combined with their expertise in managing a brand online has greatly our online presence and internal efficiency of managing our online marketing.

<review>My experience with PatientGain has been nothing but positive!  Their customer service has been personal and prompt.  They provide on going training to best utilize all their service has to offer, especially for those of us who are not tech wizards!  I know when I have a need, it will be handled as soon as possible with patience and expertise.  I have been very impressed with the service and ease of using PatientGain.</review>< Pics>

My account manager Cassandra has been building my website for weeks now. She has been most accountable, knowledgeable, skilled, and responsive. Sal always showed up at critical moments to help out as well.    My website has been launched a few weeks. I have been getting positive feedbacks so far despite the website building work is ongoing. I have no doubt it'll only get better.< /text>

< Review>
Patient Gain has helped me grow my healthcare business over the past 7 years.  My original plan was to utilize their service until I am up and running.  I was hoping to save a few pennies and once I learned the business I could handle the online marketing and advertising on my own.  After the first six months I realized that they are the specialists and I have continued to be impressed.  They are ahead of the curve. They are constantly aware of the changes in search engine marketing. This keeps my business looking fresh and gives me the opportunity to stay ahead of the competition</Review>

<Review>PatientGain really does work. I don’t usually leave reviews but I am delighted to leave this one. I opened a new Urgent Care about a year ago in Michigan. After just over 12 months of operations my website had no meaningful ranking, entrenched competitors were dominant and I was hemorrhaging cash every month.  Within two weeks of my PatientGain website, Facebook page Google+ etc. going live, I had the #2 online position and increased my daily patient count by 28% to better than break even for the first time. This past week patient count is up by 50% despite the start of the summer slowdown. I should have used PatientGain from day 1.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

We have been working with PatientGain for over a month now and noticed very positive changes in our web presence. Besides that our new website which they created is now looking nice, it has become very functional and attractive to prospective customers. We are getting new leads daily. PatientGain also runs for us Google ppc campaings which seem to be quite effective. I highly recommend these guys!!!<//Review>

<Text>We have been using PatientGain since Feb 2017 and I am very pleased at the results we have seen so far. We are a three-provider interventional pain management practice, and began using PatientGain in hopes that we could grow our online presence; communicate better with our patients; and begin tracking the value and efficiency of our various marketing strategies.

While we are nowhere near where I "want to be" yet, we are 1000% more sophisticated in these three areas than we were 12 months ago. Sal Khan and Cassandra Uribe have been 110% Responsive in terms of updating us on our progress, suggesting ways that we can measure and monitor our practice better, and basically making this a very "customized" product for our company.

I believe that PatientGain is very fairly priced for what it does. We spoke with some of the BIG companies (InfusionSoft/SalesForce/BobMangat) and PatientGain offers all of what the bigger players offer, at a price that is more realistic for a small practice.

I was more active with the website and email initially than I am now. You MUST come up with original content (OC) for your website. Even though these guys do a great job when asked to provide OC, nobody knows your practice and your goals like YOU do. So, put the time in! Same goes for newsletters --- How they do it, I do not know, but PatientGain will ---if asked ---provide OC for your monthly newsletter. But a newsletter that is written BY YOU, specifically describing YOUR THOUGHTS, or something that YOU OFFER is going to be much more effective, IMO.

In summary, nothing but ***** STARS for PatientGain, and specifically for Cassandra Uribe. Looking forward to a long and fruitful relationship with this company!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Stunning views!! Great place to rock climb. When the tide is low you can walk out onto the tide pools where you can discover any number of ocean creatures.< /Text>

They put a new starter for my car and fixed for free the damage to the "map pressure sensor", the AAA guy did to my car, while testing the starter before towing it.
I am very grateful they respected their promise to do the repair 1st thing in the morning.
Fabulous vibes from everyone who works there.
Thank you!!!</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

They take pictures of anything that needs additional repairs, show those at the shop & they even have a link for you to go look it up on your own.<//text>< Response>

My wife and I have been taking our two vehicles to Blu Auto for over 5 years, and they are the only repair shop that we trust. Every employee is very friendly, helpful and honest. They send you pictures through email and a exact price before they start working on your car. I recommend Blu Auto to everyone I know.< /Text>

I was a first-time customer here at Blu and in need of a trusted mechanic for my recently purchased Honda Accord. Everyone I encountered here was very professional, healpful, courteous and pleasant to speak with. My car runs noticeably smoother and I've had no issues whatsoever, I'm really happy with their work. I also called with an unrelated follow-up question and was helped over the phone. Thanks Blu team, and I look forward to coming back for service!< /Text>

< Review>
If I could I would give them  25 stars. My car was done by them 1.5 yrs ago, had the air conditioner replaced.  The air flow was not working and my self and the folks at Blu in Harbor City, thought it was part of the air conditioner which was still under warranty. So they took my car and gave me a loaner for free. They had my car for 2 weeks, going through with a fine tooth comb. They even had me and my son come down , while looking for the fix.  They found it, it was a water pump to the heater and air.  They showed my son , how the pump was sometimes working and sometimes not.   They would call me every 3 days for an update . The water pump alone was 500.00 , and they only charged me 300.00 for there labor. When they had to take the whole dash off to get to the air conditioner.  A great job.<//Review>

<review>I am proud to say that I have been a customer of Blu Auto for over 10 years.The time and attention Blu Auto's representatives provide is Outstanding. They make my life too easy, it's as if they already know how busy my schedule is. I simply call them (in a panic) and let them know what I hear my car is doing, they tell me to come over, and just like that my car is ready and working great. I am very grateful for the excellent service that Marvin and Dave ALWAYS provide to my family and I. Dave is absolutely wonderful at explaining the issues vs. correct mechanical functions  of what should be happening under my car hood. THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR ABOVE AND BEYOND SERVICE!!!</review></record>

Both he and Dave were very helpful in taking care of my Xterra.
When I left the shop there was still a leak, I called and Marvin asked to bring the car back and OMG they were on it, like right now. It happen to be a defect in a part and they ordered and fixed it within the hour and now all is great. My xterra runs GREAT. An what I would have paid for just 1 thing at the dealership, I got 6 things done to the car. AWESOME is all I can say!!

<Text>I went there for the 40 point service that includes oil change and tire rotation for $34. When I got there they told me that they recommended the semi synthethic oil change at $50. I wasn't too happy about this.  Ultimately the quality of service and friendliness of the mechanics won me over!
Just know they do not work with conventional oil< /Text>< Date>

As everyone knows, it is very difficult to find a automotive care facility that you can trust. It is not often that I provide a review but I feel compelled to offer a 10 star review for Blu Automotive. 5 stars for their service and the extra 5 stars for the overall experience. I could go into to detail of all of the ways that Marvin, Dave and the entire staff go above and beyond expectations but I would like to just invite you to visit one time, if just simply for an oil change, then, from there, trust me, you will not only bring all of your cars to Blu forever as we do but you will recommend them to everyone you care about. Try Blu Automotive and you'll experience what my family and I have. God bless you. Grace and peace.< /review>

<Review>I will tell you what I told my Yelp friends; this business is my go to for regular, and sudden, maintainence  needs for my Honda Hybrid. The staff is friendly and always professional. They are honest and have wonderful hospitality. I hang out in the lounge most of the time when my car is in. I live next door, so that should say a lot about how comfortable I feel in their care.< /Review><name>Monique Moon< /name>< date>

<text>I have been bringing my 1991 Geo Metro convertible to Blue for 12 years. The owner,Louis has always treated me very fairly with price. He knows me by name and does all he can to keep my repair costs low as I only have social security as my only income. They also will drive me home after I drop off my Geo. Dave, the shop manager is a very knowledgeable and fair minded person who always finds parts for my Geo,new or used. 5 stars for BLUE.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x80dd358d5d514c1f:0x1f133d0f3aed8c2< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is the only auto and body shop I trust!  They fixed my 2002 Toyota Sequoia when no one else could/would.  They went above and beyond, researching the problem and a fix that worked.  They work honestly and always for a fair price.  I would refer them to anyone and be confident they will do a good job.  Thank you, Blu!<//Review>

They had a Free Brake Inspection promotion that i had them do on my honda civic. When the inspection was completed their results were: They couldnt get my rear brake
drums off so they couldnt inspect my
rear brakes or the emergency hand.
brake. They were able to give me an
estimate of $500-600 five to six
hundred to just to do the rear brakes.
and another hundred and twenty $120.
to do the hand brake.
I took the car to my neighbor who has a small automatics business in his garage and within twenty minutes had both drums off and was adjusting the rear brakes. I also had a leak in one wheel cylinder and he then adjusted the hand brake by turning one bolt under the hand brake center console. The job took a good hour and a half and $60. With all the machinery in their shop they couldnt get off my brake drums ????< /review>

<Response>{'time': 1563657407328, 'text': 'In order to make our services more transparent we are providing some feedback. When we started the inspection I immediately informed you of the unsafe tires to which you stated that your tire shop replaced them with used ones and that they told you the tires are good. The front tire had a huge bulge on the side and your used tires had severe cracks. To test the brake fluid we needed to open the hood, It was difficult to open due to the collision damage. Once we got to the rear brake system we discovered that the drums were seized. As a courtesy I informed you of the possibility of labor and parts charge if we attempt the removal of the drums, we did this so that you would not be left with an unexpected bill. You stated that you did not want to spend money on your car and you wanted the cheapest way out. We care about our clients safety. Per our conversation it seems like the advice that you are receiving from your mechanic friend are not aligned with our culture of safety and professional repairs. A person working out of his garage is probably not licensed or insured, which offers you no protection.  We wish you the best and for your safety and the safety of others we urge the importance of replacing all 4 tires.'}</Response>< gmap_id>

Every time I've been here, the customer service has been AMAZING. I don't think I could ever hope to be as nice as the people I've dealt with at the front desk and over the phone. When I get my car back it just works, no funny business, no strange new problems, and especially no surprise costs. My only complaint is the parking lot, but that's only a problem because a lot of people must realize this place is good ( I also probably suck at parking).</Text>

<Text>I've been taking my 2003 Suzuki Gran Vitara to Blu for several years. Even though Suzuki doesn't sell cars in the U.S. any more, Blu can always find the parts I need. They always explain exactly what is required and give me a reliable estimate of the charges. I can get an appointment right away and they are friendly and provide excellent service.</Text></record></dataset><record>
<Review>Thank you Blu Automotive the auto service and customer service was the best experience I've had in a long time...my car is running like a dream!!!

Luis has taken excellent care of us for both of our car service needs as well as auto body needs!!  My first thought when someone asks for a great trusting place to take their car---it's take it to Blu Auto!!!<//text>

I found this place on my way to work.  I had a scrape on my rear left side.  I made a call and asked if I could come in for an estimate.  I went in and Luis met me.  I had two estimates w/in minutes.  One to buff out the car (which would make it look 80% better) and one to repaint, remove parts which is the correct way.  Since this was an out of pocket expense, it was nice to have both options.

I chose the full repair and told to bring the car back on Monday and it would be ready by Thursday afternoon.  And get this – you get a FREE loaner car.  Have you ever heard of such a thing???

Monday I showed up and they had the paperwork ready to go.  And up came the loaner.  I won’t say what the loaner car was, just in case I was really lucky, but let’s just say, it was definitely better than my Jetta I was dropping off and I was in no hurry to get it back.

I think I started getting emails w/updates from Luis that afternoon with, PICTURES of my car.  Have you ever had that???  It was awesome.

Wednesday at 12:00 noon I was called to say my car was ready to pick up.

Great pricing, Excellent service, FREE loaner car, Repairs completed before promised, Pictures with updates.  Whey go anywhere else???

Thank you Luis.< /review>

We will always do everything possible to provide you with the best care for your car and we have shown that over the years you have received service with us. Thank you for your comments. I wish you the best.\n\n(Original)\nHola, Abigail. El hecho es que durante más de un año le informamos que su radiador tenía una fuga y que debía ser reemplazado.

Siempre haremos todo lo posible para brindarle el mejor cuidado de su automóvil y hemos demostrado que a lo largo de los años usted ha recibido servicio con nosotros. Gracias por tus comentarios.

The shrimp and pork vermicelli noodles, as well as the fresh spring rolls, are also yummy.

I walked in to a very clean and comfortable and good essence in the air. I was quickly sat down and attended very quickly also. Great and helpful customer service at all times we were asked if anything else was needed to make our meal more enticing. The amount of food was a healthy serving so no complaints there left a happy camper. A great spot to eat I totally will visit them again.</review>

They lagged on meats but man they made up in flavor. This is possibly the best one out here so far in Salinas, Ca. Flavor is great price is on point and they have a variety of options to pick from, from a menu that u can understand. Decor good handicap access great. Parking available and can fit a big party. The lady is so nice and there customer service is great. I love that she pushes the appetizer. Thats right mam go get it. Will come again for sure when i travel by.< /review>

<Review>I usually love coming here for to-go, but today I was very disappointed. I accidentally ordered #1 but I wasn't wearing my glasses, and quickly told the lady I actually meant that I wanted to order #7 within less than a minute. The lady ignored me and threw a fit, turned to finish making someone's drink while yelling, and making her drink with so much anger. Throwing ice in the blender, etc. I was standing there in shock and while she finally let me pay she started to press the numbers on her calculator while yelling once again. They only had 3 tables, so I dont think it was necessary of her to be stressed or take it out on me. I thought i mightve been overexaggerating but her face said otherwise. I don't think I'll be coming anytime soon and I am saddened to have felt so uncomfortable for simply ordering the wrong thing.

Don't get me wrong, the other times I've came here her other coworkers are always nice.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x808dff72bc172b55:0x896d3689d2eff8f8</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

I feel the food is a bit too weak on traditional Vietnamese flavors. This is understandable since very few of their customers are Vietnamese. Otherwise, it's a good place to have reasonably priced, Americanized Vietnamese food.< /Review>

Friday, May 17, 2019

Location:
1940 N Main St, Salinas, CA 93906

PARKING:
Plenty of free parking.

ADA:
ADA parking at front door.
Looks like nearly all tables are wheelchair accessible.

BATHROOMS:
Bathrooms are clean.
No foul odors.

FOOD:
Menu is quite complete.
This is a Viet Namese Restaurant.
Don't expect to find other Asian items on the menu.
The food looks and tastes like the food served to me in Viet Nam.

Portions are ample.
You'll not walk away hungry.
Unless you are a glutton.

Prices are reasonable.

This is a great place to lunch or enjoy a casual dinner with your Sweetheart.
Nothing formal here.
T-shirt, shorts and sandals are welcome here.

Staff is pleasant.
They understand and speak English well.
However, they've an Asian ear for language.
In my case, the waitress misunderstood white rice for fried rice.

I'll return, and recommend this restaurant to my beautiful Sleeping Beauty.< /Text>

Excellent responsiveness to areas that were particularly painful. Enjoyed combination of Swedish, deep-tissue and Thai passive stretching. Helped get the kinks out and improve overall function of muscles and joints< /review>

< Review>
OMG......... what a nightmare~!  This place has the absolute worst customer service I have ever experienced in a spa.  I tried to purchase $345 Gift Certificate to give to 2 very special women. First I had trouble with the website so I called the spa. the lady who answers does not even answer as a business....  she just says hello.  I told her what I was trying to do and she referred me to her website to purchase the gift certificate. I advised her I did not use Paypal and wanted to pay with a regular credit card. After arguing with me she finally agreed to take my card over the phone and send out the gift certificates by email.
I paid for the gift certificate and she said it would go out that day.
IT DIDN"T.... So I called and asked about the gift certificate and she said she had the wrong email so she would resend. The next day, I received the email but my friends email address was wrong so she did not get the gift certificate.  I called again to the spa and she told me to send it to her myself.  I told her that was not very professional after I spent $345 with her company, but I went ahead and sent the email to my friends apologizing for the delay.  3 hours later i get a text message from the owner of the Spa who tells me that since I think they are not professional, she is cancelling the Gift certificate and sending my money back??!!  REALLY........  AFTER DELIVERING A GIFT CERTIFICATE YOU CANCELLED IT BECAUSE YOU DID NOT LIKE MY CRITICISM~!???   I should have criticized the fact that you have 'MESSAGE STUDENTS" performing your high priced services.......  You're Horrible~!

OK, Well.....  MESSAGE ENVY IS AMAZING~!!  Message Envy thank you so much for being so kind and professional and handling this for me~!< /Review>

<Review>I've been coming here for a couple of years now, and I noticed a lot of the reviews are a bit unfair. You come here for a traditional Thai massage, like you would actually get in Thailand. The masseuses are even all from Thailand. I've had my fair share of Thai massages in Thailand; from the decor, to the setup of the rooms, to the actual massages, it's a really authentic experience to what you'll get in Thailand.

Thai massage therapists are there to really work you over and beat you into submission. If you've got knots or any body soreness, they will ruthlessly attack it. Might be a little (or a lot) painful during, but you leave feeling loose. This includes using their feet and body weight to really loosen the muscles. And as with all traditional Thai massages, you lay on a cushion on the floor, rather than a table.

PSA - it's a cash-only establishment. They has free parking which is a great perk in LA these days!< /Review><time>1595823388403</time><Rate>4<//Rate><UserId.>102164257455415032236<//UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<Date>1600632910470<//Date><Review>Don’t come here for facials. No extractions or any analysis of your face to personalize the service. I asked if they can do them but the esthetician did not understand what I said. I felt like she just put a bunch of creams on my face then called it a day. The facial was done outside under a tent which was fine due to COVID but she had an alarm that kept going off every 10 minutes and the neighbors were very loud which didn’t make for a relaxing environment. My results look as if I had done an at-home facial; I did not notice a difference at all. Overall, I’m sure this place is good for massages but I will not be returning for a facial.< /Review><gmap_id>0x80c2bbbe07681355:0xe29110c4fc09216f< /gmap_id>< resp>

The best massage place! I’ve been going here for the past two years! Everyone here is great and super strong. Would recommend to anyone looking for a Swedish or deep tissue massage.
You just need an appointment in advance.

5 stars from me :)< /review>

<Text>First time client, was pleasantly surprised.
Overall, I was very pleased!! It was a quiet place with nice atmosphere and a very comfortable table.
I was greeted and made to feel welcome :)
The massage itself was very good!!
Paul did a great job and was very nice & sweet!
He earned a very generous cash tip!
I will definitely be back very soon for another wonderful massage. I recommend this place for a professional great massage, at a fair good price.<//Text>< pics>

< Review>
We have a busy schedule so I love that this place is open late - and it's 3 minutes from our house. Took my boyfriend to treat him to a massage after a particularly stressful couple of weeks and he talked me into joining him for a massage. May and Eva were our therapists and they were AMAZING - accommodating and very polite. The ambiance in the rooms is ideal; dimly lit, clean, and quiet. We got the "combination" massages and they were incredible - both ladies could find exactly where our tension was held in our muscles and really worked them over. As a bonus, the price is very reasonable; I highly recommend!</Review>

<review>This was my first time visiting the his spa but not my first Thai massage. Mai was absolutely AMA(I)ZING! She was strong and intuitive and worked patiently on my resistant muscles until they surrendered to her talent and understanding of massage. I can’t wait to go back for my next appointment! She was great and I loved how peaceful, clean and quiet the spa was! Excellent experience.< /review>< userid>

Waxing services were great. Amy made sure I was comfortable throughout the service. The massage afterwards was also done well. The therapist made sure to get the knots out of my back and shoulders. I like how easy it is to book online. Will definitely come back.</text>

It was AMAZING. I forgot what my massage therapist's name was but she was great. I feel like I have a new body. I didn't want a Swedish massage but I also didn't want a deep tissue. She gave me the perfect balance of both. Only thing is they only take cash so I wasn't able to tip her as much I wanted to! Just make sure you bring cash lol. Spa is very clean and very relaxing<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><text>This place is super nondescript and looks how you'd expect for a basic massage/spa place. I only went here because I got a gift certificate for my birthday but I sure am glad I did! I made an appointment online but realized I was going to be about 15 minutes late (poor planning). I gave them a call letting them know and they were able to accommodate me no problem! I was helped almost right away after ringing the little bell on the counter and offered water.

The room itself was nice and clean and had a large cubby for me to store my clothes and things. My only complaint is that the rooms aren't fully closed off - the walls stop about 1-2 feet from the ceiling and the doors are sliding doors so you can hear the people next to you if they're talking/moving a lot. When I went there happened to be an older man that was making more noise than totally necessary. I get that you're enjoying your massage sir, but I 100% don't need to hear it. Amy had some soft music playing though so I was able to focus on that and relax.

The massage itself was AMAZING. I got a 60-minute combo Thai/Deep Tissue and I've never felt so great after a massage. I have scoliosis and carry a lot of tension in my traps and between my shoulder blades that can be hard to get to. She somehow cracked my entire spine by doing this move at the end where she put her knees in my back and bent me backwards. I have no idea how she is so strong but it was insane and I've never had my back cracked that fully before.

Love that they have an Early Bird special for massages booked earlier in the day! Just be sure to bring cash since it is CASH ONLY. Will be back!<//text>< Pictures>

My husband brought me here on our wedding anniversary for a couples massage (yay!). The whole experience was amazing! We had Patti and Gigi work on us, and we both felt relief from some incredibly tight spots/ knots that we had. We both circled "medium" pressure on our intake form. I would say their version of "medium" might be too intense for some folks, but it hit the spot for us (i.e. if you are newer to massage, or very sensitive to touch, I would recommend circling the "light" option). Also, when there was an area that was too tight or tender, the girls could sense that, and adjusted what they were doing to match where our body was. Overall a great find, and we will be back. One note/suggestion: if there is a way to soundproof the rooms more, that would be awesome. There is a dance studio next door, and we could here that music at times during our massage. Definitely a little distracting to hear dance music when getting a massage. Overall very happy with our experience!</review>

Amy (one of the owners, massage therapists and estheticians) was AMAZING. Best wax I have ever had, they use cirepil products and it was my first time.. I will never go back to the regular hot wax. I always text Amy and she responds quickly and can usually fit around my schedule. I have become a loyal customer and I come in about every two weeks I HIGHLY recommend Self Indulgence Spa!</Text>

This is a great spa. A little gem in west LA. Great service, relaxing environment, wonderful staff and good prices. I would highly recommend it for massages, eyelash extensions and more!!</Review>

Had the works here for my 30th bday treat on Sunday 18th. I was literally going in and out of daydreams. It was so very relaxing the pressure was perfect. I haven't had a massage in years as I find it very difficult to switch off and relax but here I certainly did. I will be going back to get those extra kinks out. At first when you walk in you are unsure as the lobby is very simple but Amy was extremely calm and sweet, once you go back you know you are in a clean and peaceful environment. Can't wait to go back. Body Srub is out of this world my skin has never felt so smooth. Loved it.<//Text>

<Review>They called me 2 hours before my appointment time to say the therapists weren't arriving until an hour after my appointment time. Unfortunately my schedule didn't allow for the change and they were not sympathetic whatsoever. Unprofessional and poor customer service. I will not be going there.<//Review><Rating>1</Rating><user>106103839242733408927</user><Resp>{'time': 1461297531203, 'text': 'Hello Jacobe.\n\nI am very sorry for the mixup, and how it was handled and explained to you. We had to try to reschedule you because one of our staff members called in sick that afternoon, which forced us to juggle appointments (we found someone to fill in, but she could not arrive in time to take care of your appointment).\n\nPlease give us the opportunity to serve you.- I know you were worried that your Living Social deal was about to expire - please call me at the spa to reschedule and I will be happy to honor that original deal whenever you can come in.\n\nAmy (Manager)'}<//Resp><Name>Jacobe Jay< /Name></record></dataset><record>

Thank you Daniel, Wayne, and Scott for helping us move! I didn't realize how much time and effort it would take, I'm glad we hired you guys. We appreciate how professional and respectful you were with everything. Thank you.

This was our first time hiring movers and they made the process so simple and easy. They were very quick and efficient, they worked with us to get everything done. We highly recommend them and will use them on our next move.</review>

<review>I will never use the Irresponsible moving company ever again!  I thought using a local business would be better.   I was very wrong.  They were friendly and fast to offer an estimate, but they were also the most expensive but very nice.  However the day of the move they called to tell me the truck was delayed and would not make the 9AM schedule and would arrive at noon. I waited and by 1PM I had to call for an update; they told me the truck was stuck in traffic and would be there soon.  It was 4:20 when the two man crew arrived, extremely late and exhausted.  As soon as they arrived they took 10 minutes to rest. They said I was their 4th move of the day. Unfortunately I could not cancel the move. It was my last day at that house and needed to turn in the keys.  Long story short, the move took these guys 10 hours to complete even though I only had boxes and no furniture other than a bed, a couch and an entertainment unit.  They arrived at my new house at 2AM and left everything stacked high in the Living room.  They didn’t want to set up the bed and still asked for a tip so they could set up.  I called the company because they were charging me almost $3000 for a one bedroom apartment only 8 miles away.  The owner made it seem as if it were my fault that they only sent two people and only discounted $700 because the move took ten hours and I was not going to pay for the mess they left.  I had to hire other movers the next day and pay more money to have them move boxes to the correct rooms. I consider my move Roth this company as the worst of any move I have ever experienced.</review>< resp>

<Text>Hands down, best moving experience of my life (and I've moved a lot)! Jacob, Daniel, and Michael did a PHENOMENAL job! They were prepared with dollies and plastic wrap and they were SO FAST. They were done within the 3 hour minimum and I was shocked. The last moving company took 7 hours for the same stuff!!!! Responsible may have slightly higher rates, but they make up for it with speed! It's worth every penny! I wish I was staying in the area so I could move with them again next time.< /Text><rating>5<//rating><user>111874165894903644502< /user></record></dataset><record>

<Text>This moving company was proactive, responsive, and incredibly professional. We couldn’t be happier with their service and the choice to use them. I hope we don’t have to move again, but I’d use them again and recommend them to anyone needing help moving. They packed everything, EVERYTHING, moved everything to its respective place, and assembled the furniture. Just wow!< /Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMYWm55hf4YFVTORPkGZAqbSNpISp3wlmcoW80I=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO6DiJhvFO_n3KJJGr9F0ezGUHdXWpLsaUzVphB=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMChJZyZ9NFuiFWyOnpr9AsatXSF127kcS3NiWy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNawOhWBc3ebgdLemW9x91UVuY5ou3SK_UJGQnt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-UNyDbGEj91NN7mRzH-1brHT1HD9BeYw9D_Ws=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOjhJTZOv0zKq-z5VmNe40s1GqQawJHGl4YanDA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

Our three movers, including Said and Andrei, were absolutely fantastic in helping my roommate and i move out of our house for the semester. We were really anxious and stressed about moving, but they were so kind and efficient with the large quantity of stuff we had. We even got them hot-chocolates towards the end while we got our coffees- they were so amazing. Such a great company, definitely will be using them again!<//text>

Responsible Movers failed at the following:
-Professionally executing a move of a one-bedroom apartment that had a square footage of less than 800 square feet. This move took 10+ hours.
-Attempting to remedy the situation during and after.

This is despite the facts of:
-The move distance was less than 10 miles from the two destinations.
-Despite the fact that the movers first reaction to showing up was, wow - you have everything packed up and organized. -and then further despite the face that we further helped the movers do larger pieces of furniture due to their lack of speed.
-We provided and packaged up our own mattress in a bag; only to have it removed (without our consent) and dragged up dirty stairs at our destination. With no appropriate compensation given. Photos were shared with them.
-Movers were captured and reported multiple times to be actively not moving items and instead resting on the ground/stairs or going on long smoke breaks. Photos were shared with them.
-Repeated calls to Responsible Movers where they said additional personnel were being sent to help facilitate the end of the move and that they repeatedly told us and the movers that people were coming soon and were close by.

Even well after a failed, disastrous, unprofessional experience... Responsible Movers continues to lack the ability to be responsible.<//Text>

<Time>1599792937469</Time><rating>5</rating><review>Responsible Moving Co. were outstanding and amazing! I did my research and searched multiple different moving companies as I needed to move from my one bedroom apartment in Playa Vista (West Side) to West Covina (East Valley area). Initially, I contacted the company via e-mail to obtain a quote. The representative, Myra, responded in a timely manner and she was very professional and informative.

I explained to her my situation as I was still trying to figure out my move out date at the time. I requested quotes for multiple dates. She was very patient and considerate and she provided me the requested quotes for multiple dates, which I believed were reasonable. There were no hidden fees as she stated what the rates were.

On the day of the move, the two individuals from Responsible Moving Co. were punctual as they arrived on the given timeframe. They were professional and friendly. They were very fast and efficient with moving and maneuvering the larger items (dining table, bed, and couch). They were also very careful as they were wrapping and covering the big items in blankets, which were all included in the moving package. They were able to move all the items from one place to the other in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend Responsible Moving Co. to anyone. Thank you for your excellent service Responsible Moving Co.!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Wow, I was so anxious about moving out of our 4 bedroom home and putting everything into storage but Responsible Movers made it a breeze. Checked a few companies and their prices are fair and comprable...I mean these people are wrapping and moving precious material, do you want to go cheap?!?!? Daniel and his team are the best, on time, careful, and ready and willing to address any of your concerns. They wrapped up all of our large items and moved them with care. I am so impressed. We have another day of moving and will request Daniel and his team again. Thank you Responsible Movers for making this move stress free.< /Review>

<review>Slava, Kamran, Evgeny, & Dmitry were smart, hard working and courteous.  They moved an awkward 500 pound appliance up a difficult staircase with great intelligence.  Nice courteous guys too.</review></record>

Responsible Movers are great! I needed furniture moved into storage for an upcoming move a few months from now. They were on time, and wrapped everything carefully for storage! They also explained the process, how they label everything so nothing will get lost!

The movers were very personable and fast, and all of the personnel from the booking to the storage are great! I would definitely recommend!<//Review>

Moving can be a nightmare but these guys were a dream. They underpromised and overdelivered. The window for their arrival was between 8-9 AM. They arrived at 7:59. Estimate was for 6 hours to move a two-bedroom apartment to a home. They were finished in 5. I'm not sure if you can request specific crews but Jovannie, Herman, and Troy were exceptional.< /Review>

<Review>Responsible Moving was amazing!
Ash, Sergei And Yaroslav were punctual, respectful and hard working. They were conscientious, took good care of our stuff and even went the extra mile to organize the packing for our POD-which at first looked like it was going to be too small. Would definitely recommend them, without hesitation.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Name>Anna Khimasia<//Name><gmapID>0x80c2ba76aef24359:0x5275d4ec14ae2d45<//gmapID>< resp>

Really good. From communication and price from headquarters - to the movers being careful and kind. Moving is always an expensive pain but they made it that much easier.</text>

These guys are great! We had Kamran and Nik and they were both extremely hard working and professional! When our boxspring couldn't fit up the stairs, these guys hoisted it from the roof to get it into the bedroom. It was incredible!</Review>

Immediately responded to every email, great to talk to, took extra steps when wrapping my furniture to make sure nothing was chipped or nicked, handled everything with care and were early to the site. And on top of everything else, the best deal in town!!  Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time with anyone else.

We used Responsible Movers to help us move from one apartment to another in the same building, 5th floor down to the 2nd floor. They responded quickly to my request for a quote, sent reminders and a confirmation before the move and arrived on time and completed the job quickly and professionally. No hidden fees. The guys were very friendly and hard working. Would recommend 100%.<//Text>

My Responsible Moving Co. experience could not have been better. When I booked they only had afternoon slots available but told me that they would try their best to come earlier in the day - and they did!

This was my first move with movers and they made me feel at ease with the process. They clearly walked me through how they were going to protect my furniture and load it up, they walked me through the contract, and showed me how they're timed.

Outside of being professional movers, they were kind. This move was preciptated by a separation and it was an emotional experience for me. They helped me to feel okay.<//text>

Alex and Vlad did such an amazing job with my move. Two of my colleagues used Responsible Moving and they both had rave reviews in the office -- and they did not disappoint. Not a single item was damaged in the move -- Alex and Vlad took the time and attention to wrap delicate items carefully, while still hustling throughout load out and load in. I chose to move on a weekday, which reduced the amount of available hands for help in my rolodex, and this was 100% the best decision I made in my move. Would recommend again to folks in need of solid, hard working movers.< /Text>

Responsible Moving made packing and moving into my storage incredibly easy and painless. The guys arrived 30 mins early, easily wrapped up and navigated my snaking apt building hallways and stairs and had everything in storage in less than 3 hours. Thanks so much guys.<//review>

This was my third time using Responsible Moving Company, so that should definitely say something positive! The whole process from getting a quote and booking was very easy and the staff were communicative in answering any questions. My movers this time around were Daniel, Steven, and Douglas. They were great, funny, and very efficient in getting everything done. I appreciate their willingness to work despite the major LA heat that was going on. This is a company that I will continue to use because they continue to provide great service.<//Text>

We absolutely loved working with Scott, Daniel and Ty for our move. They were prompt and on time and worked so hard for us. We moved our 2 bed (1000 sq ft. approximate) to our new home in just about 3 hours. Really couldn't have done this without their help. Worth every penny!</text>

Had such an easy and wonderful experience moving this weekend due to the fabulous crew at Responsible. They showed up ready to work and helped me finish packing and loaded and unloaded so efficiently that we finished before the projected time (and cost!). They were courteous and respectful of my things and we actually had a lot of fun, which moving rarely is. I'll be calling them to help me when it's time to move out of storage and into my new home.< /review>

I have used this company (Daniel and Scott) and they were great. They were on time, very communicative, responsive and responsible. They started their timer not until they start taking first box out. They were very conscious about the my time. I love it and would surely use their service again.</review>

Kept me updated with timing and protocols along the way, so nothing was a surprise and I had nothing to worry about. Carefully wrapped and secured all my items in the truck, and were quick to unload in my new apartment. I worked with Jovannie and Dennis, thank you!<//text>

<Review>Responsible Movers saved me when I was so stressed with packing and moving. The whole crew was incredible. They did an amazing job and got me all moved in to my new place despite there not being any lights on for the first hour of unloading. All the guys were incredibly kind and helpful and hard working! Definitely recommend!</Review>< user>

<review>I've used this company for the fourth time in over a year. Today was a hard day moving and the 3 guys were INCREDIBLE! They worked though their lunch break while I got them some delicious food. EXCEPTIONAL work ethic and EXPERT packers and movers. I am so GRATEFUL for all the help and always with a smile on their face. Also the Truck they brought for the move was massive and fit our whole house in it.

<time>1561695665966</time><rate>5< /rate><review>Great service all around! On time, hard working, well organized on the back and front end, with great customer service. The only thing I'd have to say is the team that I used for moving in to my new apartment only had a minor set of manual tools. I told the employee who called to check everything went well and she mentioned they would address the issue to ensure there is a diverse set of tools, including electric tools to make building any furniture faster. Overall, I highly recommend Responsible Moving and would use them again next time around!<//review>< pictures>

<Date>1571696666332< /Date><rating>5< /rating><Review>Our experience with Responsible Moving was overall very good. The only reason why I'm not saying "excellent" is because I feel like they were "dragging their feet" here and there, so about 1 hour could have been knocked off the total, but it wasn't the general status quo, so overall I am happy with the result. They were careful with my stuff and put blankets on most of the furniture, so nothing got scratched or broken.

One thing that I was impressed with was that they offered to help with little additional things as well, for example moving the existing fridge from the kitchen to the garage, so that we can put our fridge instead. All in all, I would recommend this service to friends and family.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I am amazed to report...I love everything about this moving company! Online they were very responsive. I described our move from our 5,000ft house, they said what we needed, and turns out they were right on.  All of the men were sooooo nice, accommodating, polite and crazy-hard working!!  Alex, the team manager, kept everything moving smoothly.  Every time they saw me carry something big they ran to take it from me.  Our move was complex, but they figured it all out!  We will definitely be calling them back when we move again in 6 months!  Also, we will higher them to help us unpack as well!  I can’t give A high enough rating for this whole company!!<//Review><name>Jannell Greene Banchik< /name>< Rate>

<Review>We moved out of a three story walk-up, into another three story walk up, and these guys were incredible!! So professional and efficient. We couldn’t have asked for a better move. They helped secure and repack some items so that nothing was broken. They rebuilt the large price furniture items. We were very impressed and will definitely use them again when the time comes to move out.

They were able to move every thing out of my old 2 bed, 2 bath house and into our new house in less than three hours! Not only that, but our old place required them to move everything down a flight of 25 steps. They were very professional, kind, packed everything with care and nothing was damaged. I would strongly recommend their services for anyone’s move. Thank you!</review>

I don't review a lot, though I probably should share more of the good experiences I have, but this experience was BEYOND good.  We all stood with our jaws to the floor as a crew of six came in and set a new record for diligence, speed, efficiency, care and effectiveness.  After we got over our shock, we did our best to keep up, but there really was no need -- they had this move (big and super fast) covered every which way.  They're the best I've ever seen -- and everyone who was helping pack felt exactly the same.  Amazing!<//review>

Everything went great with the move. Alan and Ernesto were fast, thoughtful and careful with our furniture and boxes and made a typically stressful day easy. The move was slightly more expensive than initially quoted and the move got started just after the scheduled time which prevented the five star review. I would use responsible moving for future moves within the LA area.</Text>

<Review>Responsible M. C. sent 6 people to help us with the move, Aicmal and his team. I like the fact that Aicmal asked me to show him what he needs to move, what he needs to be extra careful. He did the same thing when I unload that furniture he asked me where we’d like to have the furniture. It feels that he is professional, and is trustworthy.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Setting up the initial appointment with Danyel was really easy. She answered all the questions I had regarding my move and made the whole thing very simple. The movers were very fast and efficient. Everything was done within 3 hours and it was probably the fastest move I’ve ever done. The company is professional, affordable, and easy to work with. I would highly recommend them to anyone in LA looking to move.<//Text>

<Review>Highly recommend! We have now used Responsible Moving two times. Great experience both times. The movers are very efficient, very careful, very polite. They moved several large items up a challenging and narrow flight of stairs that we never would have been able to do on our own. Also, great communication from the office before and during the mover, as well as from the movers during the day of the move.<//Review><user_id>112653330586734309242</user_id><user_name>Sharon Byers</user_name><gmap_id>0x80c2ba76aef24359:0x5275d4ec14ae2d45<//gmap_id><response>None< /response>< Pics>

If you're looking for a moving company, this is it! They are well priced, great customer service, and the movers were so professional and easy to work with. Its tough hiring movers because you want to ensure they aren't taking advantage of the hourly rate but these guys HUSTLED. They were moving nonstop and we were completely confident that our stuff was in great hands.<//Review>

I don't typically rate service or products online but I want to share my experience with Responsible Movers. They were truly wonderful! The 3 men that moved me were gentlemen and could not have treated me or my possessions any nicer. I am really pleased. I have no hesitation on recommending them!< /Text>

Responsible Moving Co. made my multiple-stop, 100+ mile move so easy and stress free, I can't recommend them enough. From the first call, this company has made the whole process quick and seamless. Danis and Carlos were on time, super efficient, professional and trustworthy. It's a full service company, so they were able to help me disassemble a bookcase (I couldn't reach the upper anchor screws on my own) and I was able to purchase packing paper for some glassware I didn't have a chance to box up. I would definitely use them again for any future moves. Thank you for your help!<//Review>

<review>I  used Responsible for a move from Marina del Rey to San Diego and it couldn't have been better!
The guys were quick and efficient without a minute wasted and no breaks at either end.
When paying by the hour, that's super helpful!
I wouldn't consider using anyone else next time.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba76aef24359:0x5275d4ec14ae2d45<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Excellent moving service. Alex, Sergei, Jense,and moving team were respectful and efficient. Scheduling and reminders from the front office were great too. My only criticism was my original quote was significantly underestimated.
Not untypical nowadays with service companies. Fortunately, I had already set aside enough budget ahead of the quote to cover the difference.   Overall, great service and would recommend and/or use again in the future.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

My wife and just hired Responsible Moving Co. to move us into our new house, Slava and Dmitriy were on time ready to go, they were very careful with our furniture and  the freshly painted walls. Awesome job guys. I would hire Responsible Moving Co. again. Great name for a moving co.<//Text>

<review>We had a great experience with Professional Movers. They were very upfront and honest about pricing, which was comparable or better than other companies we called. We were able to schedule our move next day, which was great.

Our movers Slava and Ilnur were on time, super professional, and very friendly. They moved everything quickly and the entire process was seamless. We would definitely use them again and refer them to friends!<//review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp><GmapID>0x80c2ba76aef24359:0x5275d4ec14ae2d45<//GmapID></record>

This team was prompt and communicated day before and morning of to confirm.  Had everything I needed for the move and more; even took some old furniture of my hands to discard for a very fair fee.  They hustled their butts and were efficient and kept time to a minimum. Daniel and Scott and crew really took care of me.  Thank you!</review>

Each and every one of your workers and Movers are such friendly and kind people, they don't just treat you as a customer but as a close friend. The Movers,  the did such an outstanding job in moving all of my things from my old home to here. They time they did it in and the way they did it completely blew my mind. I know for sure that I will be recommending your company to any of my friends and family who need help moving in the LA area. Man I wish every company would work more like you guys and work to get the job done right the first time, no questions asked.< /text>

The pictures of the moving job are very inaccurate. They use boxes that are almost falling apart when they pack your things. They will only just basically only 1 layer of the thin plastic wrap to protect your things unless you complain and tell them to do a better job.

They will insist that they do not need to take apart furniture to move it. Then when the break your furniture and say well you get $0.60 per pound for insurance so tough. Then you complain and they will offer a professional furniture repair service. Except that professional furniture report company only does TOUCHUPS! they don't actually repair your stuff they just make it less noticeable.

They don't tell you when they take a break and they so when they left for lunch with ALL YOUR STUFF you have no idea what's happening.

They only load carts with 1 or 2 boxes at a time so it takes forever to get things loaded and unloaded. They are getting paid hourly so they just do not care. When I moved 2 years ago it took the moving company half the amount of time they took and so they end up costing me much more money and with broken furniture.</Text>

< Review>
This is the only one moving company which satisfied all my needs. I have been calling all possible movers but the majority of them were either too expensive or the staff was really weird. As for this one, I had no doubts they'd do all the list of things I needed. And that was true. The movers were patient and quick and did everything on time. The price is also fair and with no hidden fee.< /Review>

My aunt decided to move and put her trust in me to help her find a moving company. They were so nice and helpful from start to finish. Not only did they help her move into her new place, but they also helped her with all her new furniture! I was so impressed. They made carrying in her grand piano look like a piece of cake. No scratches/dents/accidents. We have had a bad experience with previous companies, but I was extremely satisfied with them. 100% recommend.< /text>

Rain or shine, these guys deliver impeccable service!  (My move happened to be on one of the rainiest days LA has ever seen.)

This is the second time I've used Responsible Moving Company...and they did not disappoint.  Rather, Zach and Eli exceeded my expectations.  They wrapped all of my items to ensure proper protection from the elements.  And despite being drenched to the bone, these guys remained professional, positive and diligent.  My items were transferred safely and without damage.

Once again, I would highly recommend Responsible Moving Company. Thanks Gents!</Text>

Fantastic local movers. Nick called ahead so I knew when they were on their way and showed up on time within the window they gave me at booking. Nick, Marcel, Ion, and Oleg wrapped everything quickly and loaded the truck carefully but efficiently, saving them time and me money! We were moving into storage and a new house and they still finished in the estimated time. I would recommend Responsible Movers to anyone looking for a local mover. Thanks guys!!<//review>

I hate moving because from previous experiences it was always pricey and hidden fees too, finally at last found Responsible Moving company and my goodness has moving been such a breeze. The estimate they gave me from moving from my apt to house stayed as is and they were so nice and straight to getting me out and moving in no time within the same day all was switched over to new place. All was handled with the utmost care and will for sure be recommending to all my friends and family.<//Text>

Great experience!   Damen and his crew did an amazing job.  The moved us from the Los Angeles area to the Bay area in a 32 hour period, start to finish.  They wrapped and secured over 50 pieces of art, as well as sofas, tables, chairs, unwieldy mirrors, and an entire walk-in closet of rack hung clothing.  Everything was wrapped in plastic to prevent scrapes, or, in the case of art, in cardboard frames which protected them.    After packing they left LA at 4 in the morning so that the unpacking would be completed after noon the next day.  If we have to do this again we will certainly use them.</review>

I asked them if they could come over in a few hours to move my stuff and they were at my doorstep at the time I asked.  The movers that they sent me were very professional and very accommodating to what I asked of them.  It was a pleasant experience dealing with these guy would recommend to anyone else looking for movers to help you move.< /Text>

Tried to over charge my husband and I over $175! They worked for 3 hours and tried to charge us 600. Then was arguing with my husband in my own home after they lost screws to our stools and blamed us for not noticing. Then drive back to give them to us and tried to charge us an extra $175 while making us feel unsafe in our own home. Beware. Horrible experience.< /review>

<text>Hi everyone, just wanted to share a quick review of my experiences with Responsible Moving. I recently moved to Mar Vista from San Diego. These guys were ok with driving down to San Diego to grab my stuff and then take it my new home in Mar Vista. I didn't think that they would, and that I should use a San Diego Company, but they said they didn't mind. These guys were very professional and respectful of my stuff. Thank you guys for everything!!! Also, if you know anyone who needs to move in Southern California, these are the guys to hire.

<text>Great Company! Really stand up their name. I called on short notice and they were able to accommodate my move. They started from packing my place, done perfectly, everything in kitchen was wrapped with bubble wrap and paper. Loading and unloading of my belongings was hassle free. To transport my clothes they provided free wardrobe boxes, which was very much convenient. When it came to billing the price matched what I was quoted. Would highly recommend Responsible Moving Company!<//text><pics>None< /pics>< GmapID>

Amazing experience! I booked our move with Danyel who answered all my questions. Our moving team - Slava and Manu - showed up early (gave me a heads up 30 mins before which was great) and worked so hard. They treated all our possessions with care and respect and made the whole process easy. They worked quickly and No time was wasted. Couldn’t have asked for better. Highly recommend. Price was clearly stated and fair. Ask for Slava and Manu!</review>

Do not use this company!!!

After arriving at 8:45am the 3 movers took 9 hours to FAIL in relocating a 2 bedroom unit to the building adjacent.

Not only did I arrive home to beds completely in pieces and laid on the floor but nothing, not one room without exaggeration, was completed.

I over spent for their service and was incredibly dissatisfied.</Text>

I really don't enjoy moving but Responsible Moving Co. made it as painless as possible. I've never worked with a company that provides a free estimate and it was a great experience. They were super nice and gave me the estimate later that day.</Text>

<Text>I have a lot of big items and several boxes of breakable that I was concerned about. The moves showed up early and had brought these little wooden carts for moving the furniture. So professional! I showed them the boxes that had the breakables in them, and they took extra care to pack them last with padded blankets wrapped around the boxes. I got a bit lost on the way to the new house, but they managed to find it before I did haha. Great job, would use them again, but hope this will be my last move for a while.<//Text>< pics>

The whole process was very smooth. I reached out for a quote through e-mail and was followed up by a phone call. Everything was set up for a date and confirmation through e-mail.

They drove over to my new location and unpacked everything smoothly. There's not much to say, except that these guys are amazing!

I hate moving, and I definitely dont want to move my things myself. So I decided to call Responsible Moving Co to get a quote.
I had to move last minute and everywhere i called was super expensive.
After my phone conversation with Responsible moving co  they were able to give me a discount so I decided to book with them.</review>

Man.... these guys showed up, moved a million awkward pieces of an artist's mess, and showed no bitterness (although I'm sure our move is now in the list of "Can you believe that one?!") My friend and I had to move out of a dangerous location, quickly. We didn't have time to pack everything, and we're artists, so much of our belongings include oddly shaped sculptures and large pieces of art. What a mess! The movers were careful, considerate, kind, and compassionate about our situation. Due to circumstances, I had to book the day before the move. Every step of the way was easy and conflict-free. Truly, these guys were angels in what was otherwise a very distressing situation.< /text>

< review>
The time came to move after 16+ years of living in the same place and we were dreading the experience.  We have been told that most of the time movers don't show up, that they have all kinds of up charges, that they are careless and inneficient, and the list of potential problems went on and on.  We contacted Responsible Moving based on an acquaintance telling us they had used them to move before.  We had a great experience and were very pleased with them, and would use them again without reservations.

The process started with them estimating the number or hours and manpower that would be needed for our move. We worked with Alex via FaceTime, who evaluated all the items we wanted to move and provided us with a best and worse scenario estimate.  At first we thought the estimate was a bit high but we decided to go with them.  The moving team showed up exactly on time and started working right away under the direction of Damon who ensured their efficiency.  They diligently worked for the next 12 hours always smiling and never showing frustration until they were completely done.  All our belongings were safely moved and there was not a single item broken or damaged.

A few weeks later we needed help moving some large steel cabinets we had bought for our garage and setting up some rugs and furniture in our home. We didn't hesitate contacting Responsible Moving and Solya came with an additional team mate and they got the work done perfectly once again.  If we ever need help again with any moving we would contact them again without hesitation.

If you are moving and want a worry free efficient experience, don't hesitate to engage Responsible Moving.....we couldn't have hoped for a better moving experience.</review>

Just finished a move with Responsible Moving Co. and could not be any happier. Really live up to the name!

After reading a dozen reviews on a bunch of companies, We quickly zeroed in on Responsible. They had lots of positive feedback from recent moves which was key. The Office staff was extremely helpful in determining the size of truck and amount of help we would need. No pushy up sells or urgency to book. They let me think about the price they offered and call back. No pressure. Once we decided on them, Myra and the Nancy sent over the easy documents to secure the move and make a very small deposit. (100.00) via Venmo. It was good to see they use modern technology to take payments too!

They gave us an 8am -9am arrival and were there right on time and got right to business. We walked the house first with Alex the Leadman and his team to discuss the plan of attack, knowing that they had a 4 story Townhouse on the other end, they were really sizing up each room with a clear strategy. They wrapped each piece with care and precision and packed the truck like it was a champion "Tetris" competition. The move was amazing. the didn't scuff a single wall, or scratch any of the hardwood. We haven't finished unpacking, but I am positive that there won't be any broken furniture due to the pin point accuracy of these highly experienced movers. Oh, did I mention that they had to go back for a 2nd trip? not one complaint. I am recommending these guys to EVERYONE I know.<//Text>

I absolutely loved their service. I moved from Marina del Rey all the way to Northridge pretty painlessly thanks to these guys. I have custom made furniture shipped from overseas that I needed to be handled with care and they did an amazing job. Truly responsible movers!</Review>

Terrible. Two of them were rude and unprofessional. Only one of the guys was actually helpful. They broke one of the knobs off of my dresser and instead of telling me hid the broken piece in the drawer for me to find later. Also, stained my headboard with dirt and stained our staircase with the tires from their dolly. Wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. Extremely disappointed in their service and employees attitudes.</text>

I was disappointed with this visit. My husband got me tacos and an iced coffee. The tacos were cold and the shell was almost rubbery. The iced coffee is normally good. Today it was like drinking straight creamer. It was so sweet I couldn’t drink it. Normally this location is good but the last few times I have come here I have been disappointed. Will most likely start going somewhere else.</Review>

I really didn't want to go into details, because I have decided NEVER to go again. My sister and I walked in to order to go.  Big mistake. We watched ad the person who took my order and money went back to prepare our food without washing his hands touching our tacos (cold, hard) my sister kept me from saying anything. I could not eat my food. Will not go back. Maybe no more fast food.<//Text>

This Jack in the Box on mission gorge is terrible. I advise not to go there. I ordered two jumbo jacks and two fries and one drink. Waited in line an extremely long time. They gave me only one order of fries and one jumbo jack. I had to go back and ask for my food that I paid for. Terrible service. This is a big inconvenience when your order is not given to you. They had a bad attitude. No manners apology. They need better training.<//text>

This place doesn't care for the well being of its customers. The cashier the same person who handles cash is the same person serving fries, drinks and opening paper bags. Ofcourse she has gloves she's protected but what about customers ? We're in the middle of a pandemic where is the common sense.< /Review>

Stopped in to try the new mini tacos.  We decided to get the 15 taco option without the sauce on top for $3.00.  They were served hot & crispy.  The staff at this Jack in the Box are friendly and wanted to know what we thought about the tacos. Worth trying.< /review>

Order was placed in the first quarter of 7am and was not ready when arrived for pick up at 7:30 till 7:50am and they forgot to add an item. Had to go back for it and the cashier had the nerve to say I forgot the item. REALLY! You are putting the order together. Started handing it to me. When I arrived back the cashier was putting the missed item together after I arrived the second time.<//review>

This is the worst jack in the box I have ever been to. I have visted this location on multiple occasions over the past 2.5 years and I don’t recall ever having a positive experience. The workers are very rude and very lazy. My orders are almost always incorrect and the food is always cold, never fresh. I will no longer be visiting this location.
(Also the workers are not wearing masks during the COVID mandatory mask order!)</text>

The conversation with the people are very interesting. And the staff are very fast...on a side note not every time I got into a Jack in The box and it's been good today I asked for a cup of water and was denied I even had my own cup also I was denied use of the restroom and look down upon is that a bag just goes to show you everything changes in an instant<//Text>

I like this Jack in the Box. Personally I feel they take my order correctly more often than not.

I'm rating 4 stars because the drive thru exit location can be frustrating. And I haven't been inside to see what it looks like.<//Text>

I usually go late at night, and there is a gentleman who is usually there who goes above and beyond, great dude. However, sometimes there are some women there who have pretty crumby attitudes (they might've been having a bad day, I don't know, but that shouldn't affect your work ethic), and neglect the most simple requests. She asked if I wanted sauce, i replied "ranch and taco sauce, please", she then scoffed and didn't put any in (i didn't realize there were no sauces until i got home). Either way, it's jack in the box, so it's whatever. Good luck reading all that 😅</review></record>

<text>Jack in the Box is awesome you don't feel like you're rushed into your order and even though they get the same pay as McDonald's because I just reviewed them just a minute ago for the a little breakfast sausage or breakfast bacon I have not tried breakfast at Jack In The Box in quite a while so I'm sure it was good I think a breakfast burrito oh yeah that was good. I would suggest these for breakfast biscuit with sausage would be a Chick-fil-A number 1 number two Carl's jr. Number three Jack in the Box breakfast burrito as I remember was good. This review that I gave McDonald's a little while back was because $8 for the freaking breakfast breeder piss me off it was just like this they had how many years to figure this out and when it still tastes like not the best thing in the world but I can eat anything but I'm still kind of disappointed cuz because I've been going to them for freaking over 40 years they have had plenty of time to Perfect food,.< /text><rating>5</rating>< Date>

If all fails go to this "JACK IN THE BOX". Day or Nite "drive thru is open 24 hours". It is in the Golden Hills area of San Diego, 24th & Market. The employees have been  always respectful & courteous.< /Text>

<review>There is one person in the morning that has been amazing, but my overall experience at this Jack has been terrible, one morning they forgot I was waiting at the window and had to honk my horn to get their attention because my food was just sitting there, Then at night they've forgotten items... :/ Corporate had tried to help, but I'll be damned if these people act like they don't want to be there.  Except for the one woman in the morning that knows my simple order.< /review><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>I like their chicken teriyaki bowl and it comes with 1 egg roll. Now if you've never had an egg roll from JitB, well its impressive. They cook them from order so they're never sitting underneath a heatlamp and usually too hot to bite into right away. Today we had to pull off to the side and wait just a little bit because for or order. Wooorth it.<//text><time>1564432254379</time>< resp>

< Review>
For some reason I always hit a traffic jam whenever I use the drive thru. Doesn't matter the time. Don't expect a quick drive thru experience like chick fil a or even taco bell in the area. It's really easy to get to and from the 15 freeway so I guess that's what makes it popular.</Review>

I love Jack in the Box as the go to late night food but this place has messed up my order at least 3-4 times. Once I ordered a burger with no meat at all and ended up with a burger that had bacon. The service itself is usually nice but sometimes the order can get messed up but they do help fix the order any way they can.<//review>

<Text>Slow drive thru. Finally got to window. Drove away and had somebody elses order. Went back inside and they remade the order. Something that was supposed to be quick and convenient became a delay and inconvenient. Food was good though once I got the right thing.< /Text>< pics>

What is Marcela, Pancho, Nicole and the Manager Norma...they're great people...the problem there is that there is such great turnover of employees that at times it undermines the effort that they do to make the Customer happy....maybe because the owner of the Jack in the Box doesnt provide good benefits and so anyone that has potential to make that particular JIB a steller performing store. ...but i guess no one really cares about the employees.....so people leave....</Review>< pictures>

Jack is usually my pick among local fast food. This one declined to honor a BOGO e-coupon I received on my smartphone from corporate Jack, saying I'd have to print it out. On National Cheeseburger Day, seems pretty lame.</Review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>Either the owner, district manager, or corporate manager needs to make a visit during the late shift to witness how  unwelcoming and horrible the service is here.  Each time i have visited this location during the late shift I have experienced horrible service. I went through the 24-hour drive thru and had to wait nearly 5 minutes before someone finally took my order. The lady that took my order clearly had an attitude and if anyone should have an attitude that night it should have been me! For having to wait so long before I could get my order taken. Then when I get to the window I had to repeat my order because she had gotten my order wrong and all I asked for was an Ultimate Cheeseburger on sourdough bread with only EZ mustard. No fries or a drink. How complicated is that?? On top of that, some fat Asian kid at the window ALSO had an attitude! Here's a word of advice: If you don't like your job QUIT AND FIND ANOTHER ONE. Let's get it together Jack in the Crack!< /Review>< username>

I ordered a 4 piece chicken strip for $5.19 and they were the size of my 12 year old son pinky finger.  Not Good!  And to add insult to injury, I went imto the mens restroom and the air dryer to dry your hamds didn't work and they didn't have any paper towels.  The bathroom stinks as well.  I shared this with an employee at the cash register and he looked at me as if I had dog poop on my face.   So my son and I walked away and will never ever go back to a Jack In The Box!</Text>
