Native east coaster here.  Good pizza and close to the name.  They have both thin and thick crust and the dough is good. Wings have a lot of sauce but I like that.  Meatball subs are excellent.  Decent selection of beer.</review>

Being from Brooklyn, NY, I'm constantly searching for that Brooklyn slice. Some say it's the NY water that makes the dough primo. Back in 2003, I stumbled across Brooklyn Pizza and I was pleasantly surprised. It looked, felt, smelled and dripped oil with the funnel squeeze, passing the test.  The last few times I was there, it didn't have that "wow" factor, I was informed the original owners sold the place.  It's still pretty good, but recommend eating it there , it looses translation with delivery.< /review>

Great pizza! Friendly service.  If you are in hurry, order by phone and it will be ready when you get there.  If you want to eat there, it'll take about a beer to get your order.<//Text>

Pizza is decent.  But to be clear its not Brooklyn NY style pizza.  If you've had Brooklyn NY style pizza, it has a distinct style, crust, and texture with fresh ingredients you can taste.  So calling it Brooklyn Pizza is a bit misleading.  Don't get me wrong the pizza was decent, but its pizza you can find pretty much anywhere else in Marin at a dozen other pizza places.</review>

One star, but deserves ZERO. Fundamental principal of having a website that takes orders and collects money is that you provide something for it. Their website charged me after telling me my card was declined, and the employee I spoke to wouldn't deliver my food because she said it hadn't processed yet. Be that as it may, ya got my money babe. If you can't maintain functional UI, then don't employ it. Really simple.< /Review>

Meh. Average at best. Nothing NY about it. Pretty bland.

UPDATE: The review above was for whole pies, but by the slice in store is much much better. More aligned w NY pizza - greasy, crispy, awesome - if not a bteer-than-expected substitute for the real thing.</Text>

< Review>
So the only reason I'll give it two stars is that the food was edible.

I waited an hour and ten minutes for my pizza to be delivered two blocks.  Why order delivery if I only live two blocks away?  Well, because I'm sick.  And I didn't feel like getting out of bed.  And pizza sounded good.  WOW!  Epic mistake.  In fact, maybe the food was edible because I AM sick and I have no sense of smell or taste.

Besides the pizza taking long enough for them to have gone out and milked the cow to make the cheese, it came hot but soggy.  That tells me it was made, set aside, and then reheated.  I'm guessing here.  But whatever, it was gross.

We've had their pizza before and it was decent.  Nothing to write home to mama about, but edible.  This time it was barely even that.  With all of the pizza choices we have, we won't ever be back.   And they certainly won't be delivering again to our house.</Review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>A few days ago I ordered from this place using the Slice app, and the experience I've received makes me leery about recommending either this place or the app, especially for people who have food allergies.

When I ordered on the app, I ordered the combo, it was the standard meats, veggies, exc. Nothing out of the ordinary and definitely no anchovies in the description. I was tired, I wanted food, and I wanted a new-York slice. I also wanted to patronize something local and not a chain, so I got what I thought would work. When I got the pizza and bit into it, I was immediately hit by a taste that was like fish sauce, and the texture of crumbly parm. I figured it was just bad parm or something, but it put me off my appetite after trying to get a slice down, so I put the thing away. Next morning I figured I'd just brush the parm off or something, and then realized that there were anchovies on the pizza. Wait what? Did my finger slip and add anchovies when I was ordering? Did I miss something in the description saying they'd put fish on the pizza? I checked and... no, I hadn't added anything and the description was anchovies-free.

So I contacted customer service for the app, and they contacted West Brooklyn Pizza, apparently their combo DOES come with fish on it, but somehow that part didn't end up on the menu, and this is where the Slice app and West Brooklyn Pizza started bouncing me around.

Slice kept saying that they couldn't give me a refund because it was only the pizza shop that would be able to do that, and they could only authorize a seven dollar credit. West Brooklyn said they prepared the pizza as item is on their in-house menu, so they weren't at fault and weren't going to give a refund.

The problem is, it's not just a 50$ pizza that I was out on, but I have friends and family with food allergies. An order being made as it's described is not only a personal taste issue, but it's the difference between a nice meal and a life-threatening trip to the hospital. The rep said he'd look into it further and contact me after he got in touch with the manager of West Brooklyn Pizza.

The long and the short of it is that despite them saying they couldn't, the app gave me a 50% refund and said they'd look into improving their app in regards to menu correctness, however on the pizzeria's side, it's a different story. I only got an email from the Slice rep saying that the manager refused to either redo the pizza or provide any refund- in fact, nobody from West Brooklyn Pizza even tried to contact me. Like when you hear "oh man, that's a problem, people I know could've died if it was something like clams on there" your response probably isn't radio silence and refusing to make up for the error, like even if you weren't going to compensate, you'd probably at least call and apologize. And if they even were to ask for the pizza back before they'd do anything, that'd be fine. They could come and pick it up (I don't have a car, and busses don't allow food on board), because I still have the thing in the fridge.

But ultimately because of this experience, I don't trust West Brooklyn Pizza. Their web page is built on Slice's platform and info, they could have checked their own website and saw that the items on that menu didn't fit what they actually make. Moreover their disregard to something as potentially serious as food allergies doesn't inspire confidence. Which is a great shame because we need small places making good food, and from the other reviews I've seen- If I could've eaten the food I'm sure it would have been good.

But I can't, and they didn't take this situation with the seriousness it deserves, so I have to rate it as it is, and have this review be a caution flag to people with food allergies</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

<review>Delivery is quick, prices are very reasonably, and quality of food is good. Only thing is pizza can be a bit greasy if you like a lot of meat on it. People are friendly, owner is super cool guy who remembers your name if you go often.

Meatlovers was awesome. I was a bit concerned it might have "too" much beefy chunks but there was slices and o was it good. The garlic bites were good but could have took a little more garlic goodness on the outside bites. The center was Devine! They were fast and prompt.<//Review>

The pizza here is terrible. The dough tasted like the pizza dough you get from Safeway but didn't know how to cook it right. The Sicilian was disappointing. Too doughy, dry and dense.</Text>

<text>Spoke with the owner about how dissatisfied we were with the pizza we had ordered after it took over and hour to deliver. Once we received the pizza it was completely soggy. I told the owner and he claims he has done business for 30 years and his vegetarian pizza is supposed to be soggy.
I will never order from the business and the fact that he didn't care and didn't offer to do anything right by the customer. It was $65 in total and a complete waste of money.<//text>< pictures>

We ate at Brooklyn pizza last night. The pizza half vegetarian and half meat was not good !!.  The veg half had no flavor and the meat half a bit better but the pizza was soggy !! Anyway we enjoy next day pizza. This pizza was a 'Soggy' mess the next morning!!! . 'Unedible' to say the least. Pizza should 'Never' be like this!!. Will never eat here again . Please see all reviews before eating at or ordering from this place! BEWARE !!< /Review>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>Bought a pizza last night and I am very disappointed. We tried this place thinking it would be good pizza with its reviews on Google but unfortunately it was a disaster of a choice. Do not trust Google reviews ! Not worth your time or your pocket. Pizza was very unappealing and very dry. No sauce on the meat lovers, the pepperoni looked more like meet you would find on a falafel at a Greek restaurant. The Greek pizza had only pure cheese and sun dried tomatoes, overloaded with spinach to the max, was not expecting that! I would say this place needs to at least give a little effort to their pizza making. The pizza was cut in such an odd angle, weird slice sizes. Most places will make the same crust pizza with two different toppings however you can tell this place did not, and had two different crusts like they had cut an old pizza in half and slabbed it on the pizza box...< /Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Pizza is to die for.
They have salads, sandwich, beer and wine,
is a family oriented restaurant.

I had a salad with chicken and my girlfriend had meat pasta. Both were very bland and the textures were horrible. The chicken and meat pasta came out of a package from the freezer (this is my conclusion). Terrible food, stick to the pizza.

I ordered the Sicilian cheese pizza and it was literally inedible. The crust itself was burnt to a crisp all over and then it seems they just covered up their mistake by throwing cheese on top. You could peel back the cheese in a single sheet and underneath it was pure black. It was disgusting.<//review>

Brother is a weekly lunch stop for me for a delicious salad, sometimes even twice a week! They have the best salads in town, honestly the best in the valley! The service is amazing. Everyone is so kind and makes you feel like family on your first visit. Not only are their salads THE BOMB, with all of the different sandwiches and fry options you really can't go wrong with anything you choose! Do yourself a favor and just stop in, you will be hooked!</review>

Don't even know where to start! Brothers must be the best burger place in the 209!! I could write a whole essay on how good it is but you just have to try it if you're around. The burgers are delicious the turkey sandwich (forgot what its called but had guacamole) delicious and the fries are delicious!!! Seriously its BOMB here. The picture of the grilled cheese sandwich with a patty and bacon does no good to how it actually looks and tastes in person. But anyway definitely give the garlic parmesan fries a try it's worth it and let's not forget the awesome staff they're amazing it wouldn't be possible without them!</review>

<review>First time coming to Brothers and we were greeted with extremely friendly and attentive staff! Food is absolutely amazing and it arrived to our table well within 10 mins of ordering. Inside is very nice and a calm atmosphere, music is not too loud so you can easily talk across the table. Overall fantastic first experience, great people, food, and prices! Will be back for more!</review>< pics>

This great little place is hampered by covid restrictions and it's an injustice. We carry out burgers too big and delicious to eat at one sitting.  The best time to eat there is when you are really hungry</text>

Brothers has the very rare quality these days of providing great customer service along with delicious food! It’s hard to find that combination in a restaurant, but they do it well. The family that runs brothers is as nice as can be & I’ve never met a menu item there that I didn’t like lol!</Text>

You guys lie about the price!  You are dishonest!!! On website you show $3.66 but sell for $3 76!! I waisted my money because of incorrect information! I could buy it cheaper but I was driving for setup? Who is responsible for it? Who's gonna pay me for losing money? Even more you have here none working phone number! What a terrible place!</review>

Our family go to gas station... Great in & out pumps with fabulous prices... Plus incredible customer service...EVERY TIME! Simply, they have the best quality gas...
(Our cars have never seen a 2nd class gas station with watered gas, examples=Arco & BP-we cherish our investment & safety)..
... The best time efficiency/quickly in & out and certainly the BEST PRICE in an insanely, vastly obscene overpriced area of gas stations that are placed to gouge the heck out of tourists. The employees are great, always smiling & always remember their customers. Being loyal isn't a given because you're convenient, it's earned because you're doing right by your customers & treating us FAIRLY as well as always going the extra smile!< /Text>

< review>
Manager and Owner being very difficult and argumentative and offered no help or customer service whatsoever.

Beware!!! They will authorize more than twice the amount on your card when pumping gas and sometimes take more than 24 hours to deposit the amount back into your account. I drive Uber for a living and no gas station in the entire San Diego county does this. I've never encountered a problem like this and the Manager practically called me a liar and put me on the phone with the owner of the gas station and he became very argumentative with me and offered no type of help and just gave me the run-around. Very poor business ownership qualities if you ask me. He tried to give me some toll free number to call for my issue and offered no help whatsoever...Dude You're The Owner....Do Something About It!

I'll never pump gas here again...Literal Highway Robbery!<//review>

<Date>1589744687571</Date><Rate>4< /Rate><review>Decided to give this Thai restaurant a try, when I get there, the outside doesn't look much, more like a Thai fast food cafe. I ordered Pad See Ew w/ chicken, Tom Yum Fish, Crab fried rice and a Thai ice tea. Among all, the best was the Crab fried rice, they used lots of real crab meat, and it tasted amazing. The Pad See Ew was slightly too sweet and the Yom Yum Fish was slightly too salty and not spicy at all, although I did mention I wanted extra spicy. Overall, they do serve decent Thai cuisine.< /review>< pictures>

<text>Four stars for convenience, and three and a half for the food. But be sure to understand the heat. Medium spice was WAY hot so I would suggest asking for mild And spicing it up if needed. My mouth was burning which affected the flavor.< /text>< name>

Been here about 4 times now.. Each time, it's a different experience with the food.  It ranges from a good amount of food for the price, to not much at all.   Today I asked for Gra-Pow with ground chicken.  The chicken was barely ground at all, the dish is almost all green beans, and no bell pepper to be seen.  Hardly any basil, and not nearly as good as it had been before.   Also.. mixed-veggies isn't worth the price.. it's mostly carrots.  I'll hesitate going back a 5th time.  I wish they would be more consistent.. Service is very nice though.< /text>

Very expensive for what you get and the chicken is dry and overcooked.  The woman that takes the orders is not very friendly.  I went about 4 times but won't be going back.</Review>

<review>Hands down best Thai place around. Little hole in the wall with amaaazing food. The flavor is amazing in every dish we've tried,  and they can make it whatever spice level you want.

Definitely recommend the spicy salmon curry and eggrolls!!!</review><rate>5</rate><time>1601695551746< /time></record>

<Review>I have to say that after all the years I've ordered take out and delivery since their opening, they have become more and more stingy over the portion sizes of their food as well as increase in their prices.

I ordered the Chicken Salad and Beef salad which usually come in a large white container full of greens but this time around they literally prepared the salads with only one cup of vegetables and 2oz of meat. That's pretty pathetic for the $19 I paid for both salads. I've never been more disappointed.. I noticed the difference in the preparation of their food (chicken being dry, food being overcooked, etc) but this.. this is pretty bad. The size of the salads alone should've been worth $5 at most. This will be my last time ordering from them. One customer down.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Run by Native Thais, Sri Siam has a plethora of Thai delicacies to enjoy. The restaurant is quaint, meant for takeout and delivery-food. Their Western take on the classic dish, Pad C Ew is perhaps a little too sweet for the palette of Native Thais.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2dbe53d09627b:0xceaed282d946b8e1<//GmapID>< Name>

<text>Great atmosphere. Nice staff. Super yummy food. Love the smoothies. I'm weird about textures and the smoothies are good. I opted for simple chocolate chip bagel and jalapeño cream cheese, but I saw people get some bad ass bagel breakfast sandwiches.

<review>Weak lox bagel. Green tomatoes, flavorless lox, hardly any cream cheese and browning lettuce.  It was like everything was of low quality and a little past it’s prime. Even the onions were flavorless. IDK maybe I bumped my head and ruined my tastebuds while sleeping... The wrap was fine other than the size and the browning old spinach inside. The lady inside seemed nice for the 30 seconds I saw her. I had ordered by phone. Kinda pricey at $20 for the lox bagel and a small wrap.<//review></record>

<Review>This is the first time staff was rude with poor customer service.  We walked in and they there were 2 people preparing food with their backs towards us.  They clearly knew we entered the restaurant because their legendary door bells rang and we were talking loud enough for them to hear us.  Still nothing.  No "I'll be right with you" or maybe just turn around and acknowledge we're there.  At least 2 minutes goes by and my adult son says is anyone going to help us?  Then a new kid comes from the deeper kitchen area and asks for our order.  The man fixing food overheard my order and without turning around mumbles to the kid that the oven is out and they can't make that.  The kid repeats what the mumbleman said.  We decided to take our money elewhere.  What a shock and disappointment.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

I have only been there twice but both times they gave me exactly what I asked for even though it was kind of a picky order. I very much appreciate a business that gives you EXACTLY  what you want and with a smile. The attendant was very polite.
The flavors are great, made fresh, the ingredients are fresh, nice crisp green spinach and best of all at a good price. Over all a geat place for a quick yummy meal. Mos Def recommend!!!</Review>

Always a pleasant experience. Bagels are delish but the main reason I like this place is the cream cheese spreads they have. Sweet ones like fig and goat cheese or savory ones like blue cheese and chives. It's never too loud or too crowded either.< /text>

Google maps directed me here as a good coffee place. They only have the basic old watered down coffee with a big opened bottle sitting on the counter over the garbage rather then in the fridge. As for the bagle, I could have gotten better at the grocery store for about the same price.</Text>

<Text>Overpriced food. 2 bagel sandwiches and a salad with a coffee $27. They were good but not $30 worth. Also a rude cashier. I added meat to my bagel, which costs $1 according to their menu, yet she rang it for $1.50. When I asked about it, she copped an attitude and refused to change it. The manager came by and fixed it without causing a scene. I was pissed not bc of the $0.50, but the principle of it; definitely not coming back.< /Text><userid>115638230490150922022<//userid></record></dataset><record>

Awful service, the person who took my order didnt listen and was very dismissive. I ordered an egg bagel well toasted with cream cheese and butter. I just got a warm dull sorry egg bagel with cream cheese. The bread is low quality, may as well have gotten a bag from costco and made it myself. Never coming back here.</text>

This place is truly beautiful and a great hike. However parking is very scarce and the trail is rocky and difficult. If you are looking for a quick walk to a beach and easy river access I would look elsewhere.< /text>

<text>Favorite river spot! Moderately deep emerald water, lots of room to swim. Parking fills up by mid day - get there early. You can get down to the rocks/water on the side of the bridge. Recommend water shoes.< /text>< pictures>

What a great spot. This is a beautiful area with lots of places for swimming and hiking. The water is clear and perfect temperature for cooling off in the summer heat.< /Review>

Great place to relax. We showed up and got a good spot on a big flat rock! Water is deep enough to jump from rock into river for a good time.</text>

Multiple trails to explore. Multiple places that access the water. The water is beautiful and clear. Parking is a pain because it's very limited. There was a decent amount of people there but it didn't feel crowded or uncomfortable. Mostly kid friendly.... some trails or water access points might be tough for small children but there are still plenty of easier ways for them to get down.< /text>

<review>A truly lovely location for a hiking/camping adventure between the months of middle to late June to late July, early August (when the water level is low and thus safer and warmer than the rest of the year).  I am used to hiking south (downstream) for at least 1.5 miles or until there are VERY few others and the pools are huge and clear.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<Text>This is an awesome place to swim, hike, and to hang out. The water was cool and clear and plenty of places to choose from to swim or jump into. The flow of the water is safe enough for kids to play in with life jackets and have a good time. Make sure to always bring water shoes.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM9V1se_Ze5SObZyUYI4TsLQFL2lb-qVKYXlx39=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Nice place, but absolutely no parking on the weekends. Drove here from Sacramento. Risked it and parked across the bridge, got a $300 ticket along with 50 other cars, kinda ruined my day. Wouldn't come here on the weekend, probably pretty nice on a weekday when you can park.< /review>

Don't have to go far to reach the water but steep approaches to the water unless you are willing to walk downriver a ways.< /Review>

<pics>None<//pics><Text>Everyone at Birdhouse/Doghouse was friendly and professional. I appreciated the time our groomer took to talk about our dog, what we did and didn't want in a hair cut. This place has been in business for 12+ years and it took more than four days to get an appointment. Longevity and a busy store says something about their reputation.</Text>< Rate>

If asked to summarize in a word, that word would be CARING.

We all have pet companions in large part because we want to care for them. "The House" gets this and its staff of really kind, sweet handlers provides the loving care we expect when our pets are away from home.

I'm really particular with my pets. I have purchased supplies, grooming services, and have adopted with "The House". Every experience was positive and warm.

Eccentricities aside, this is a local business with a mission that should be regularly patronized and supported.

You'll feel good about it!   👍👍👍< /Text>

I take my dogs here for grooming and dental work. Courtney is an amazing dentist!! My dogs had the worse teeth and because of her their teeth are white and healthy. I highly recommend this place. They truly care about our animals.<//Review>

Small pet shop specializing in supplies, feed, grooming and rescue pets, good opportunities to volunteer to play with their pets and walk them. Open and welcoming staff, also sells cold drinks. They accept donations of towels, blankets and food for the rescue pets.</review>

< Review>
Not appropriate for people with exotics. Only supplies dog, cat and bird, and has no knowledge of other pet supplies. It took me several tries of asking specifically for a cage for a rat to find out they didn't know about or have anything that would work for small animals.<//Review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Review>(Translated by Google) Hayer take a dog for cutting and bathing but unfortunately they gave a bad service to the point that ended with irritated eyes and I had to take it to the hopital and the diagnosis they gave me is that because of the bad service my dog ​​has ulcers in the eyes since his vision is very damaged and the worst thing is that I went to claim that they will return the money I paid but they refuse to return it to me when it is really their fault for not having the necessary care with the animals.

This particular Little Caesars make a decent pizza. I been to other ones in past and this location surpassed them. The staff are nice but be aware when calling in a order make sure  you make the person say out the order and have gather your info. I have experience two different incidents when my order was not in they system but have records of me calling.<//Text>

<text>You know there's times where you go in to a place and you have to wait because it's not ready, usually they say oh 5 minutes blah blah, you wait and your food is fresh and ready for you to go on home and enjoy it.  Then there's times where the food doesn't come out right and you then experience the quality of the establishments  customer service.  Well tonight I went in and waited an extra ten or so minutes after the 5 i was told I inspected the pizzas myself as I do every pizza joint and the cheese was burnt and I asked for a new one they tell me I'll have to wait ten more minutes. Or some free sauces smh step your cooking game up and serve this town some pizzas. The toppings are cheap and that's the reason we end up coming here so at least make it right for customers to enjoy. My 17yr old said it's tough enough to break teeth. Sorry kids but next time a refund will do.<//text>< time>

Always a wait at the Patterson local Little Caesars pizza. And they run on their own set of rules.$ 7 for a $5 pizza sauce is tangy straight from the can. The extra pepperoni is not like the TV commercial. Hardly ever any hot and ready pizzas made. All young teenage staff some think they know everything which calls for a very unfriendly visit from time to time.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I don’t think there’s enough good things to be said about this place! Had my tires looked at today and wasn’t sure if it needed balancing or whether it was a completely different issue. They did the work anyways and told me I didn’t need to worry about paying, even after I offered to, because they were helping me figure out what was wrong with my vehicle. These guys are honest, genuine and tremendously humble people. Would highly recommend checking them out if you haven’t yet already. I’ve bought tires, had tires fixed and other services completed here. No issues!<//review>< pics>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>When I lived in the area, I'd always buy tires here for the great price and quick, no fuss service. I like having different price points (based on quality) because sometimes the wallet just isn't as flexible! And I've gotten plenty of like-new tires for much more inexpensive than big box stores.

Recently I drove in from out of town just to purchase 4 new tires from here - the price is that good and they are just honest guys you want to give your business to.</Review>< pictures>

<Text>They are always friendly here. When it might take awhile to get your tire fixed or mounted they let you know right away and have a comfortable waiting room and bathroom.  Most of all they have good prices. Only reduced one star because they don't always have the sizes I've needed. But you can call ahead and they will let you know.<//Text>< GmapID>

<Review>Can't say enough about how great my experience with Quality Used Tires was today. I have had a tire that has had a slow leak for the last few months now and would just refill it whenever it got low, because I didn't think I had the money to get it patched. Finally went in to get it patched today expecting to pay and they got me in, fixed the leak in 10 minutes, and didn't even charge me without even knowing my situation. Extremely grateful for these guys, would highly recommend their services!< /Review><rating>5<//rating><user_id>118334844086997056560<//user_id><gmap_id>0x808328bf4fd837c9:0x1b73436499fec3f8< /gmap_id></record>

This is the only place that I purchase tires. Many of the tires I've purchased have been barely used by people who want low profile tires or a preferred brand. All of the tires have a lot of meat on them and last us a lot of miles. Quality Tires is the name but also suggests their products. As well, their prices are kind to my pocketbook.< /text>

I purchase a single replacement tire for my Ford Explorer. They have a large inventory and were able to match the model and size of my existing tires. The tread also matched which was great. It was about a 15 minute wait and prices are very reasonable. I will definitely be going back to purchase a tire or tires from Quality Used Tires in the future. Thank you!<//text>

Was in Chico today and picked up a huge nasty nail in my tire. I googled the closest tire shop and Quality Used Tires happened to be right across the street. I pulled in and the guys came right out. Jacked my car up right there in the parking lot and patched my tire up for me. I wasn't there more than 20 minutes total and when I asked how much I owed them they told me nothing. Top notch customer service. I still cant believe how quickly they got my tire fixed and my wheels back on the road. Very appreciative for the staff at Quality Used Tire in Chico today!</review>

I got a flat tire over the weekend and had to replace it with my spare. I thought my tires were in good condition, but I was prepared to buy four new tires and a spare if it came to it. When I pulled in, they examined my tires and said not only were they in good condition, but my flat tire could easily be fixed so I wouldn't have to buy any new tires until the time came. I was in and out in only about 30 minutes, and when I asked how much I needed to pay, they told me that tire repairs (especially those as small as mine) were free!! I drove around and had no problems at all with the repaired tire. They could have easily made over $200 off of me yesterday, but they were honest and showed integrity by not selling me something that I didn't need. Would definitely recommend! Customer service was friendly as well!<//Text>

After having no success with US tire fixing my tire, I went here for a replacement. The lads were efficient, helpful, and knowledgeable. Great service, plus they were as busy as could be. One day down and no problems so far with the tire</Review>

I've had several tire issues due to the potholes and nails around town and have been there several times, and each and every time they give the best service and quality tire. I wouldn't recommend any other used tire place other than quality used. You guys are awesome! Thank you ☺️</review>

Tires piled to the ceiling, the smell of rubber permeating the air.  The ceiling was held together by packing tape in places; a newspaper tapped to the wall torn revealing an oblong hole. The employees pleasant enough. BUT CHEAPEST TIRES I COULD FIND hence five stars.<//text>

These guys always take good care of me. They have a huge selection of used tires with 60-80% tread life, and you pay less than half new price. I just got new wheels and tires with 80% tread (looked brand new to me) out the door for less than $500. And these are Goodyear AT's, not some no name junk.<//Review>

From the moment I talked to them on the phone prior to arrival the walked me through all my options I had, when I arrived they were very friendly and helped me on my way with 2 very good quality used tires and for a fair price I was even given a discount because I didn’t have enough on me to get the tires I wanted! I definitely recommend this place don’t go to those run down local shops where your prices depending on what car you drive or how you look.< /Review>

Im sorry for the incorrect feedback, i thought google had me posting on  America's tire company,  not quality used tires.  Quality used tires are awsome! They helped me discover the tires I had bought on eBay were faulty and saved me a $1000! Thanks so much quality used, you guys rock! Come to think of it, I'll be calling to order some tires from you very soon!!< /review>

Great staff and Great Prices!!! Just got a set of 2 Low Profile 15" tires with almost Brand new for under $100 Mounted and balanced. This has been my 3ed time dealing with this place and have to say its a Great Place to go if you need tires asap and on the cheap. Never had a problem with them so far and would recommend to anyone!!!< /Review>

I honestly can NOT believe the guy who left a negative review. I've used this place several times over the last decade and have ALWAYS experienced a great price and great customer service. I needed two tires today and brought my car in, got brand new tires pretty much for $109 out the door. I got quoted by another company in town for brand new tires about $250. Needless to say, I will continue to use the awesome guys at quality tires.</Review>

Knowledgeable and helpful. Good prices on used tires. However, when calculating out cost of used tires and projected life vs new tires the cost per mile indicates going with new tires. If you're on a tight budget this is excellent place to consider.< /Text>

I always get my tires from quality used tires. Today I walked out of work and noticed I had a flat. Called quality and they told me to bring it in and they will fix it for free. I was in and out in 20 minutes. I will forever recommend this shop hands down.< /review>

I just stopped in to get my flat repaired, guess I had a nail in my tire.  They fixed my flat and put my spare tire back in my trunk for me, in less then 20 mins.  When asked how much I owed,  they said nothing!  I left $10 for the guys to get something to drink. I highly recommend this for all your tire repairs and used tire needs!</text>

<Review>The staff here is top notch! It doesnt have the nice lobby a les Schwab or big o tire has, but they more than make up for it with customer service and honesty. I gave them a reason to charge me for 2 tires when my car was having an issue, and they said their was nothing wrong with my 2nd tire and they dont want to charge me for another tire unless I needed it. Only place I will go for tires.< /Review><Gmap_id>0x808328bf4fd837c9:0x1b73436499fec3f8</Gmap_id>< userid>

<text>Two weeks ago, I came in because I got a flat and I needed to replace the front two anyways. Got two used tires with good tread for $80. I was a happy lady. Then yesterday, my truck starts shaking on the freeway; turns out one of the "new" tires was bubbled and splitting.  I called and they said to bring it back in.  I couldn't find a receipt, but it was no problem. They were very apologetic, courteous, and quick about fixing it. That alone speaks for itsel .</text>< UserId.>

<Review>1 star is being generous, I bought 4 Toyo T1 sports from Quality Used, had them on for 2 days and got a flat.  At that point I decided I would by new tires and go and talk to them about the subpar pair they sold me.  Talked with the owners son, Jesse, and he was so rude and condescending that I left there feeling like I was trying to rip them off.  If you like feeling appreciated spending your money at a local business, this is NOT the place.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808328bf4fd837c9:0x1b73436499fec3f8< /gmap_id></record>

It would have cost me $250 for a new tire. It cost me $50 bucks for a tire with the same amount of ware as my other tires which are fairly new.</review>

I once patroned this established earlier in the yr around April. I own a vehicle that is difficult to locate tires for and was in a pinch, and had the great reviews and decided to give them a try. Called them and they happened to have tires that had come off a vehicle similar to mine. ONLY THEY FAILED TO MENTION THE TIRES WERE SIX YRS OLD. The tires were loud and wobly on the rd, so I had them checked at Yuba City Honda by actual mechanics (btw I know you're reading this "guy who sold me these tires" and yes Actual mechanics with real experience, jobs, integrity etc..) told me that not only did you sell me tires that were WAAAY out of date without informing me, but you also DID NOT balance my tires before sending me on my merry way. I have the receipt. Read it and weep. Finally when I confronted these gentlemen about the issue, but they swore up and down that they balanced them, telling me I was wrong even though the receipt of work rendered at Yuba City Honda (again by actual mechanics) stating explicitly the tires were far out of balance and needed a lot of weight. A small issue that could've been fixed with a simple "I'm sorry". I get it we all forget and make mistakes but own up to them and be respectful to your customers. I'm serious. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY HERE. These people are disrespectful and don't consider putting your safety before the money they hope to rip off you. Enjoy your one star.<//Text>

<Review>Have been a customer for quite a few years. Had a flat in 100+* weather.  Came in hot, dirty & angry...as well as late for where I was headed.  They not only got me in and out in record time, they remounted both tires and wouldn't accept any $.  Made a huge impact on the rest of my afternoon.< /Review>< Rate>

<text>It has been two months since I payed for my car with reciept on hand to be transfered to my name with my registracion, veronica has poor customer service as they kepted saying the dmv has made a mistake in transfering the new registracion under the old owners name, the workers that work in 8th street and alvarado veronica's insurance have no idea what they are doing and can't admit they made a mistake. I would of written down this bad review if they just admitted they messed up. I do dont recomend title and registracion transfer with this insurance, as soon as they give me back (if they do) my title and registracion I will be finding another insurance that are capable of doing their job correctly.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><rate>1< /rate><user_id>110403302946255065296<//user_id><date>1603772249743< /date><Resp>{'time': 1606756798247, 'text': 'Hello Joel!

Yesenia is such an amazing person. Every time I come down to the office she makes me feel like family. She makes sure I’m always having the right coverages. She explains the whole process with detail and never leaves anything out. I give this place a five star 👌👌<//Text>

Have to say this place has the best prices that you can’t go wrong with, was looking for insurance but many company’s were charging too much. The employees gave me a great price that I couldn’t say no to. GREAT customer service!!</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>This place is GREAT! I came in looking for reasonable prices and friendly service seeing as how my last insurance provider was very difficult to communicate with and even get in contact with. But I came in and was helped by a lovely young lady, I believe her name was Mariela. She was very professional but approachable. She waked me through the process and made sure I understood every single thing she covered. She gave me a more than reasonable price and given her well demeanor I feel Veronicas Insurance will be a good fit for me and my family.! So if you need insurance check them out, and ask for Mariela!</Review>< Pics>

<name>Sandra Barden< /name><time>1621013124816</time><review>After arriving at our desert home we were greeted by a severe ant problem. As we were only there 2 days we called several pest control companies and Bug Guys Pest Control was the only one able to be there the next afternoon. The technician sprayed both inside and out and gave us suggestions on how to minimize the problem. Will definitely use them again.< /review><gmapID>0x80daf9b278556a81:0x6e92a2bd245866e6<//gmapID>< pics>

Just moved in and needed an initial “spray”! Have lived in the desert for 30 years prior to moving back. I am aware of what little “pests” we have, especially when the heat hits! Bug Guys came highly recommended.  Excellent service, polite and courteous!<//text>

<review>I can not say enough positive things about Tony with The Bug Guys!!! I’ve utilized him for some time now and no matter what the situation is from personal to business he ALWAYS comes through in a timely manner with a smile. He and the company could not be any easier to work with, reaching out the day before a visit to remind me he’s stopping by to having an autopay system, they’ve taken all the hard work out for me. Best pricing in the desert for the level of service they provide.</review></record></dataset><record>

When I  discovered a termite problem I researched several different exterminators. I decided on the Bug Guys. They came out to inspect the same day I called and  we scheduled a time to fit my schedule . The technicians were on time, friendly and courteous. When the work was completed they cleaned up the work areas and left as found less termites. Good price,and good work. Very Happy. Also having them out to spray for insects quarterly.</text>

Bob inspected my roof and surrounding area as a precaution.  He gave advice on various aspects of my property and confirmed all rodent
external entry points were concealed.  I am now using this service on a monthly schedule.  Thank you Bob.</review>

<Name>Robert Barnes<//Name>< Review>
We had a bee hive and swarm since March and adjacent to our front door. Realizing   their importance in our food chain we let them be bees with little more than passing glance until last week when they suddenly became aggressive.  I was stung twice and not only did it hurt then but created a painful lump just below the skin and remains painful. We contacted BUG GUYS PEST CONTROL late afternoon.  They came the next morning and
shortly thereafter bees were gone. Professional, accommodating, responsive and quite pleasant with a competitive price BUG GUYS PEST CONTROL are now the only service I’ll use.<//Review>

Bug Guys does a great job with better pricing than any other pest control I've used in the desert. Plus they're based in the desert rather than out of town. The staff is friendly courteous and treat you with respect.<//review>

< Review>
I have used The Bug Guys a few times now and they have been wonderfully professional, reasonably priced, prompt, friendly and helpful. When we first moved to our house we had a LOT of ants and crickets. We tried to handle it ourselves with ant traps and spray, but they just kept coming.  BG came out quickly and took care of the problem! Fast, efficient and really nice people!</Review>

Bob  is awesome! Don’t waste your time looking for a different exterminator. He returned my call while on his vacation because I freaked out over roaches. He gave me his first appointment when he got back into town. He had so many great ideas and tips! He was very reassuring! He’s quite the character too, lots of funny stories! We highly recommend him! Thank you Bob!< /Text>

<Review>Upon contacting this company and expressing my pest control concerns they were able to fit me in within 2 day's. The professionalism of the office and the field staff thus far appears to be too notch. I have been with over a half dozen different companies over the past 20 years in the Desert area. I feel extremely confident in my decision to choose Bug Guys and I am excited about this new business relationship for years to come.</Review>< Resp>

Bug Guys are great, they notify us in advance of our appointment and show up during the window they give us. The techs are helpful and answer any questions you may have. And best of all NO BUGS, except for the ones you find on their backs and no longer moving.<//text>

However the amount of time I was concerned about for spraying took less than 10 minutes I’m used to people coming and spending more time I will only know how  this works after a while to see if in fact I have no more critters in my house.

<Text>Bug guys has to be the most professional company I’ve dealt with. Ever!!  They have come to my rescue on many occasions with all kinds of different pests.  Every technician that has come to service my house has been friendly, knowledgeable and timely. Hugo was amazing. I had been dealing with a pigeon problem for weeks, and He got rid of them within an hour! I also had a scorpion problem that’s been fixed now because of my regular service with Matthew. And bug guys also serviced my house after I found termites! I would highly recommend them!! They Continuously make paying for the services doable with my budget, and for that, they will remain my trusted pest service. Thank you bug guys for all that you do for your customers. You truly go above and beyond.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Response>None</Response><review>The Bug Guys responded quickly and followed up in a timely manner on my urgent request for a termite inspection at a property. They were able to work my inspection into their schedule, were professional, knowledgeable and I had a report the same day. Very reasonably priced. I was extremely satisfied with their service and I will gladly hire them again in the future.
Thank you!</review>< Gmap_id>

<review>Removal of the critter under our porch (skunk) has so far required multiple visits, covered under the initial price quote.  More visits may be necessary before we can be sure the problem is solved and at $25 each, this could add up.  Seems there should be a more efficient method to achieve the goal or no extra charges until satisfied.</review>< Pictures>

These guys are the best! Not only they are knowledgeable but they are all extremely polite answering any question you might have. They won’t do any unnecessary sprays or overcharge. I am a very satisfied customer. I have recently moved and I have changed pretty much all services except them. Awesome team!</text>

Returned my call immediately even though it was after hours. Scheduled an appointment for a termite inspection required by real estate laws. Tracy arrived on time & was friendly, courteous & professional. Answered all of our questions & sent the report to me quickly. I have already referred him to several people I know that are selling their homes. Highly recommend!!<//Review>

<review>I have been using Bug Guys for years.  They spray annually in the summer before my vacation.  Since  I’ve had Bug Guys spray each year, no bugs.  Before I had a problem with ants, cockroaches, and earwigs.  This year, they are also helping me with a rat infestation in the outdoor landscaping at my condo complex.  I highly recommend Bug Guys for any help needed with pest control.<//review>< pictures>

Always on time, friendly and helpful. They even once removed a dead snake free of charge.

They give me a heads up the day before they come so I can keep my chickens safe.

It's been a couple years now and I hardly ever see a bug.

Highly recommended !</text>

<Text>I had a problem with wasps. Jesse, the Bug Guys tech, came on the day I called and found their nest. He proceeded to tell us what he was going to do and suggested we leave for an hour so that we would not get stung.

It has only been two days but so far we have not seen any wasps.

The Bug Guys rock!
I was a client of Western Exterminator for over 15 years. However, ever since they sold company to UK company service has not been the same. Also, the yearly rate increase was not acceptable. The Bug Guys technician Kyle is the best.< /review>

<text>Highly recommended by my neighbor. I spoke to Carlos after he finished my neighbors house, he came out 2 days later at the time promised. Carlos did a thorough job spraying inside, outside and garage that will last 3 months. So far, have seen no bugs anywhere. Thank you!<//text>< Pictures>

What I like best about these guys is that they are so courteous and call in advance to let me know they’re coming in case I might need something else. They treat the outside of my house and I haven’t seen a bug in my house since the day they started. It’s like invisible magic. I would highly recommend them<//Text>

Super professional pest service.   The termite reports are top notch and best value in the desert.  My experience with their monthly service is also terrific.  Kyle, my service technician always lets me know he’s coming, goes above and beyond for us.  I recommend them to all my clients.<//Text>

I waited one week before reviewing the service. So far the treatment has worked. The ants that had taken over the patio are gone. The same goes for the lawn although those colonies were hard to detect. The technician arrived on time. He was polite and informative. So far I’m very satisfied.< /Text>

Wow this company is amazing! I bought my first home and noticed I had some bug issues... I saw their sticker on my water heater and decided to give them a call. I called on Friday 5 minutes before they were going to close and a young lady picked up and was very professional and passed my information to a pest control worker, within 10 minutes Tracy called me and told me he can come to my house Monday morning at No Charge since he inspected 3 months ago. He came on time treated the area at no charge. When I got home I called him to ask a question not thinking it was 6 PM ( well after hours) -sorry- and he picked up without hesitation and answered my questions. This is truly a great company and deserves 10 stars! Now that I have my new home I know now who to call for any pest control issues!!! Thank you again!!!< /Text>

I have had them since I moved to the desert in 2007 and couldn’t be happier. They are always on time, and very attentive to the home. If I have questions about anything, they take the time to explain what they are doing and using.

Highly recommended.< /text>

<Review>Phenomenal service at a reasonable price.

I shopped around when I looked at pest control services and found the bug guys.

We had a scorpion infestation and my wife was upset.

They scheduled me the next day and I haven’t seen any bugs whatsoever since we started.

Their chemicals are also pet friendly so our 3 dogs can enjoy our backyard without fear.

Highly recommend them, they took extra time to make sure our questions were answered and our needs were met.< /Review>< Date>

I had a serious problem with German cockroaches in my kitchen. After my exterminator couldn’t get them under control. I called the bug guys. The tech came out, treated inside and out, came back again to treat and I haven’t had any problems since. They come out every month for maintenance. I have recommended bug guys to many of my friends and will continue to do so.</text>

We have been using Bug Guys for almost 4 years. We had a really bad scorpion invasion inside and out when we moved here. After using another pest  control for a year or so, the scorpions were still appearing. Carlos has been taking care of our problem and has almost completely alleviated our little friends. He is always there for me if I need him to come out for any problem. Which is rare now. Very happy and satisfied with this company. And you are the best, Carlos! Thank you...

I researched and found Bug Guys on line. I called and made an appt. They showed up on time. They inspected my property and made a game plan to get rid of our pest problems. The set up traps and we have had immediate results.   They have been very professional. So far so good.</review>

We have paid for rodent exclusion since December 12, 1019 and there are still rodenst in the attic up to today! We were told thaf it will take 10 days before rodents are completely gone. It is now the 23rd of December and we placed rodents traps in the attic and still finding 2 to 5 rodents a day caught in the trap!
We paid $500.00 for rodents exclusion and $125.00 for rodent trapping and rodents still exists!!!<//Text>

Always prompt in their service, & always notify us a day before they come.  Price is a bit high, based on what my neighbors pay for bi-monthly service.  Might need to shop around.</text>

I was confronted with a unsightly bug one night at 2 am. After trying to removed it for hours, I gave up, went to Yelp and reached out to many pest control companies. Not only did The Bug Guys respond immediately, they were at my home the same day, serviced my apartment, earned my trust and eased my mind. Wonderful service all year long. I’m very happy.</Review>

I always get a text the day before they arrive which is appreciated  and I haven’t had any pest
problems since they have been coming once a month.  I chose them because of the type of
spray they use - it is not harmful to my pets - so very happy with them<//Review>

<text>I had a fruit tree rodent problem that was working it’s way to the house and I needed help.  My national pest control company was ineffective and seemingly uninterested in helping me or even offering up solutions, thoughts or options.  4 years ago I called Jeremiah at The Bug Guys and incredibly, he/his company have become the most reliable, most effective home-service vendor I have.   Have and will continue to recommend them to family, friends and publicly here on the WWW without hesitation.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

We have been using Bug Guys for 4 years. During that time they have provided such an excellent service treating the outside of our home . That we have Zero bugs on the inside. I recommend their service 100%.< /text>

Called the Bug Guys and other local pest control companies.  I spoke to T.J. and I felt comfortable with his information and price.  Al came out the same day and did the spraying inside and outside.  It was obvious Al knew the area and the type of bug problems.  The next day we had dozens of dead crickets outdoors.  The spray really works.  I am relieved I can count on the Bug Guys to come monthly and get ahead of the bugs.  Great job and service.  I would highly recommend the Bug Guys!< /text>

They Bug guys are really responsive. Moving into a new home we have had lots of bugs and they come that day. Usually within a few hours of my calling. Hector our guy is so polite and always on time. He even texts me to let me know when’s he’s coming. I can text him as well if there is an issue - like the giant spider that showed up in my closet.<//review>

Very patient! Incredibly meticulous in the effort to spray the bugs away-
When you live close to a commercial kitchen- thee is a high volume of flies- yellow jackets- ants etc
My organic garden was left in peace-
With gratitude and respect I am thankful<//review>

It is nice to have such reliability and competence from a company that actually cares about the customer.  And they do all this at a fair price.<//text>< Pics>

Since meeting the Bug Guys Pest Control we have been extremely pleased with the service we get.  For the price we pay, the bug guy stated he would spray the house and the gardens to keep bugs away.  We have exterior cameras on the house and we are totally amazed at the detail spraying in all the corners of the property including around the pool area.  We are extremely please and would highly recommend this company to others.< /review>

Great first visit. We moved in our new house in La Quinta 6 weeks ago. We noticed a lot of water roaches in the house and fire and Argentina ants, and various spiders and bugs. I used Home Advisors to see the top exterminators in the area. Got an immediate call from Steve (even though it was well after hours). Jose was out the next day, sprayed and explained many of the types of bugs that we may see in the desert. Very personable and friendly. I think I’ll like using the Bug Guys.<//text>

We love the Bug Guy & Josh who is our Bug Guy, they are extremely professional, reliable & friendly.  Every month we get a reminder call from Josh the day before our service to let us know what time to expect him.  I have been with the Bug Guy for four years & would highly recommend them.< /Text>

< review>
We have used Bug Guys Pest Control for over a year.  Manny is our service tech.  He contacts us the day prior to coming out.  He always checks if we have any problems and reminds us to call if we need him to come back during the month.   I would recommend Bug Guys to anyone needing Pest control.</review>

Professional, polite, thorough, all for a decent price. In today’s world those attributes are sorely lacking. Not at Bug Guys Pest Control.</Text>

I paid and fired them.
We were supposed to meet at 11:00 they showed up at 10:30 and did what they wanted with the tenent for a $34.00 bill, I hadn't hired them yet
I was mad but paid them.
Now the owner of bug  guy's said I signed a contract.
That's a false and wrong statement and I owe him $175.00 to get out of contract. He told me, I will go after your credit,so I said I paid you for one spray job $34.00 and now your fired have a nice life.
Be really Really careful.< /Text>

<text>I have lived in the desert since 2006, I had tried many pest control companies.   As I became increasingly less satisfied over time, i decided to try Bug Guys.  I have been using their services for about 3 years now and LOVE THEM!  Matthew has been my steady technician and has continued to go above and beyond for us.  He calls or txts me the day before service with  times as a reminder each month.  He even answered questions I had, then I found out he was on a cruise with his wife at the time.  This guy and company are amazing, go above the call of duty and I would give them 10 stars if available.  Forget the rest and end your search.  Big Guys Pest control are King!!!</text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x80daf9b278556a81:0x6e92a2bd245866e6</GmapID></record>

We get monthly service to take care of all insects and spiders and cockroaches etc.
They spray inside and out once a month as well as brush away anything on perimeter of house that might invite spiders mice rats etc.
Thank you< /text>
