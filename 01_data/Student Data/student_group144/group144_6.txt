<text>I highly recommend these guys! Ron has been very helpful in multiple facets with our business. He came out last week and installed a new lock on a new property we just purchased within just a couple hours of our initial phone call. He was right on the ball. We just had an issue at the same location but it turns out it was unrelated to the lock and was actually the door. He helped us get that fixed even though it wasn't something he had installed himself and we were able to get the problem resolved. Thank you Ron!<//text><gmap_id>0x80dc016b14e6c4c3:0x399b45bf5c8e98b2<//gmap_id>< user_name>

Ron is amazing!! Look no further! Professional and punctual. I lost all of my keys and was unable to get into my own place. I call the first locksmith near me when google it and now I know that I was super lucky to get Ron to answer the phone. He showed up when we agreed, he had to drill through both of my deadbolts and replace them. He also re keyed my 3rd lock for free! This man is very punctual which is what locksmiths must be as people are stranded a front of their houses like i was earlier today.<//review>

Ron is super friendly and it only took him a few minutes to get the job done (and this for a unbeatable price). I would definitely recommend his services to anyone living in San Diego.

Showed up in a mask and very eager to help! He came in and knew exactly what he needed to do and fixed my lock very quickly. I called late at night and he picked up right away and was quick to get to my house. Will definitely be using this company again if needed and recommend to anyone needing a locksmith!< /Review>

Good price excellent service. He came by my house and gave me a competitive price estimate. One of the door knob locksets was too rusty inside to be re-keyed, so he stood by his original price estimate and gave me a new one at no extra charge. I highly recommend Socal Locksmith.< /Review>

So I was locked out of my car today but with everything inside including my wallet, my phone, and my keys obviously! Once I called from a public phone, Ron was to my car within 10 minutes!! Super nice and very helpful. We got inside the car in less than 5 minutes and I was also to purchase a second key and he made it on the spot so I don’t run into this problem again. Overall best road side service I have ever received hands down!!< /review>

Ron was superb! I scheduled a re-key about a week in advance, and Ron was knowledgeable and efficiently re-keyed all of the doors we needed assistance with. He also went above and beyond researching how to reprogram our Schlage lock. He made the whole process stress-free. We’re thrilled with how the locks turned out and also very satisfied with the value of service we received. 10/10 would recommend! Thank you Ron!</Text>

Ron was a true life saver! I got locked out of my place and he was able to come help. He got here fast and was able to help me fix not 1 but  both my locks in a timely manner. They work better than before! He’s extremely professional and knowledgeable. I saved his # in my favorites so I’m able to call him next time I have a lock issue (I’m a ditz and lock myself out of my house and car a lot lol, so I know Ron will be my rescuer from here on out). I’m truly amazed at how amazing he was in helping me. If you need a locksmith, Ron is your man!<//review>

Ron did an amazing job rekeying my front door and garage door. He was available on the same day, communicated well with his ETA and completed the job perfectly. This is the second time he’s provided a five-star service! Hired him back in 2016 to change my locks and rekey after some renters moved out. Thanks so much!!</Text>

We needed a lock replaced, and Ron was very helpful and flexible with negotiating prices. The service was quick and efficient, had no issues when scheduling the appointment and they got here punctually. Overall, great service, would recommend!</review>

SoCal Locksmith is amazing!  They advertised as 24 hour service and actually answered the phone at 6:00 am on a Saturday morning.  Ron calmly advised me not to worry that he would be able to unlock my fireproof SAFE and sure enough he did!  It was quite a job but he did it capably and with professionalism! I highly recommend this business.< /Review>

<text>Ron is my hero!!!

I had a boot (tire claw) on my tire that we was able to get off efficiently without doing any damage to my car!! I called other locksmiths and nobody else would even come out to look at it because it was a boot. I highly recommend Ron because he was very professional, and he got the job done!!

Thanks again Ron!<//text>< Pictures>

Friendly and Professional. Unfortunately,  I locked myself out of my apartment on the Fourth of July. FORTUNATELY for me, Ron from SoCal Locksmith was there to save the day.  He offered great communication from the first initial call.  Ron was quick to unlock the door and help us to go about our Fourth of July celebrations. Without a doubt,  if you are in need of a locksmith,  SoCal Locksmith of La Jolla is the business to call.< /text>

Awesome and efficient service! My door lock was giving the locksmith a bit of trouble since it refused to open, but the locksmith offered to switch it out for a new one free of charge. I couldn't be more grateful, as I would have been locked out for the night. Thank you, SOCAL locksmith!< /review>

Great service! My car took a while to reprogram but they persevered and were able to figure out the issue for my key. Ron and the other gentleman were very patient and got the job done right. I got my key remote replaced and everything functioned correctly.<//text>

I got locked out at my house in the night, I called SoCal Lockshmith at 10.00 PM. Ron came on time and unlocked the door for me and he also prepared a new key for me in the night. He is very patient and professional. I would highly recommend him.</text>

Ron did a great job installing rekey new locks on my house. Quick- efficient and friendly. I called and within an hour he was out to the house. Also, he had a quick fix for a lock that was broke that matched my current decor silver colored. I am a very happy customer.</review>

Ron was extremely professional and accommodating while navigating around unrelated construction issues at the property. My doorknob and deadbolt, which had been not been functional for months, were replaced within the hour. Couldn't be happier with the results. Thanks!

I called socal locksmith late sunday night after calling a few locksmiths in the area. The other companies just quoted me pricing without even knowing the precise details of the job. Ron came thru in the clutch big time! He was the only one that requested pictures so he could give me an accurate quote. He arrived on time and was more than professional AND cordial. He handled the job fast and was very cool to work with.  I felt very comfortable with with him in my apartment as he was very easy going and chill. He even replaced my lock at no charge!  I would without a doubt recommend Ron and his company 100% for any locksmith needs. On time, professional, fair priced and super pro! You cant go wrong with Socal LockSmith!<//Text>

<resp>{'time': 1535240275489, 'text': '(Translated by Google) Thank you Sary, for using our services. Our goal is to take full care of all your security and emergency lockout needs, 24 hours a day. our trained professionals are here for your call anytime. Sorry if you really think it was over budget, but remember this is an imported 3 point door lock that is not easy to repair, or cheap to replace let alone install on a non-ordinary or inexpensive door. However, their total cost was actually below the average charge for that type of job. Either way, as a preferred customer, you get up to 25% off on our next visit.\n\n(Original)\nGracias Sary, por usar nuestros servicios. Nuestro objetivo es cuidar al máximo todas sus necesidades de bloqueo de emergencia y seguridad, las 24 horas del día. nuestros profesionales capacitados están aquí para su llamada en cualquier momento. disculpas si realmente crees que fue por encima del presupuesto, pero recuerda que es una cerradura de puerta importada de 3 puntos que no es fácil de reparar, o es barata de reemplazar y mucho menos instalar en una puerta no ordinaria o de bajo costo.

< review>
I was referred to Albert’s Jewelers by a friend of mine and couldn’t be happier. They helped me select a new setting for my wedding ring and were able to set it while I waited.  Both Albert and his wife Lisa are very personable and a pleasure to do business with. It was great to support a local business and I will definitely return to them in the near future.<//review>

< Review>
My name is Marcelle. I am the customer that Albert was helping when Chantal came into Albert’s Jewelry store in North Ranch on Wednesday, February 24. I wanted to clear up some mis-information stated in her review. First when this person came into the shop, Albert immediately greeted her, just as he did me earlier that day, and then said he would be with her shortly as he was helping me. And yes, we were looking for a dove charm that I wanted to put on a gold chain as a confirmation gift. She did get that right. She did not ask to see stud earrings. Nor was she in the shop for 7 minutes. My estimate on the time was about 3 - 4 minutes.
It is true that my purchase may not have compared to what Chantal indicates she wanted to buy. But that really doesn’t matter. What matters is that Albert treats his customers with respect and understands customer service. He was helping me to create the necklace I wanted as a gift.
I have been going to Albert’s for several years. I have gone into his store thinking I needed a new watch battery and after cleaning the watch mechanism, Albert told me I didn’t. And then he doesn’t allow me to pay him for the cleaning. When a favorite watch died, he worked with me to find a new mechanism so I could continue to enjoy it. Every time I walk into his store I am greeted warmly and so is anyone else that comes in after me.
I give this store 5 stars any day. They are good people.
My recommendation to Chantal is next time a small shop owner is working with someone and you can see it might take some time, you might just inquire if it would be better to come back in 15 minutes or so. In my opinion, this person owes Albert an apology for the incorrect review she provided. Shame on you.<//Review>

Albert’s is local old fashion jewelry store. Not a chain !!   Albert does in house repairs usually available the same day. He is a Master Jeweler who services are never compromised whether minor or major.
Pricing is the lowest possible as it is done in house by Albert. You will not be disappointed
They truly care about their customers 🥰  check it out 😊 You will be a regular in no time.

I have been working with Albert’s Jewelers for years. Albert & Lisa are honest, genuine professionals and always eager to assist with my families’ jewelry needs.
Albert’s Jewelers has relocated recently and like finding an honest Mechanic, they are well worth the drive. Excellent service, quality workmanship and competitive pricing is always appreciated!
I recommend Albert’s Jewelers in full confidence!

I stopped in to Albert's earlier today. A friend had recommended it. I wanted to support a local business not the jewelry mart down town. Albert was helping a woman order a confirmation charm from a catalogue. My presence was completely ignored by Albert. I spent 6-7 minutes looking all around the store. Albert did not look up or acknowledge me in any way. I even stepped over to where the customer was standing across from Albert and said "excuse me, I would like to take a peek at the studs." I spoke up not wanting to crowd the women. Again no glance or acknowledgment form Albert! As a small business owner in this economy-not acknowledging a customer is unfathomable. I was shopping for diamond studs, 3 bracelets and a long white gold chain.
I certainly hope the other customer purchased a very expensive charm.... I will never shop at Albert's again.</Review>

{'time': 1614276689364, 'text': "Hello Chantal. We appreciate your feedback and want to let you know the reason we are recommended by good folks is because of our pricing, quality and service. Albert is a very talented jeweler and usually works on the bench creating and or repairing beautiful jewelry. I agree that he most definitely should have acknowledged your presence. Our appologies are extended to you. I will add that one of the many reasons for our success and high reputation is we treat our customers equally regardless if they are changing a watch battery for $5.00 for most watches or making a purchase of any amount. If you want to give us a try once again we would appreciate it. Have a beautiful day. Kindly, Lisa Vartanian Albert's Jewelers"}< /Resp>

The nicest people! Albert did a diamond necklace repair while I waited. Who does that? 10 minutes! Polished my jewelry too! Exceptional service and quality repair. What else could I want? Reasonable price , yes that too! I am so very happy with Albert and his wife at Alberts Jewelry Designs in Thousand Oaks.< /Review>

<Review>I've been going to Albert's Jewelers for years.  I have purchased items, had them give me formal and casual appraisals, watch repairs and battery replacement, resizing rings, trade in unwanted gold....I just love the family atmosphere, no pressure sales, and they always remember me and wish me well.  Good, professional work/quality and fair prices.  I trust them with all my jewelry needs.  I went to the Los Arboles Thousand Oaks location and saw they were no longer there!  I looked them up and found them on Lindero Canyon at Kanan so be sure to go to the new location!< /Review>< date>

Albert and his wife are awesome!! I had to just go to their store to have my wedding band ring cut off so I can get an MRI of my hand and Albert did an amazing job! So careful and safe and I will return back next Saturday to have him repair it. Didn’t even charge me to cut it off. They even fixed my watch a few years back and did a great job! Please support them! The two of them are Gems!! Ian S.</Review>

<review>Albert and his wife Lisa are at the very top of the list for a small business that has offered consistent and reputable service and sales over the last few decades. I was very distraught when I showed up at their old Avenida de Los Arboles location near the Thousand Oaks DMV and thought that the business had likely closed when I saw the empty space and signs taken down.
Thanks to a Google Maps re-route, I was very happy to find out that they are now in a new, and much easily accessible location in Oak Park, right in the Pavilions shopping center at 1125 Lindero Canyon Rd, Westlake Village, CA 91362.
The new location is great and they have fit right in with their unique and impressive array of jewelry. They truly care about their customers and it shows in how friendly and cordial they are with you during each and every visit. I appreciate both of you and your caring service so very much!</review></record>

<review>Albert and his wife are so kind and extremely fair! Albert made me a custom engagement ring that came out stunning! The price was fair and be resized it for free! When we went back for my wedding band I told them exactly what we wanted and we agreed on a price. When we went to pick up and pay for my ring they adjusted the price to something lower beachside the thaloufht it was a more fair price! They make amazing Jewellery and are so honest! I highly recommend them to anyone looking to get good quality Jewellery from kind, honest, and hard working people!</review>< userid>

<Review>Oh my gosh, we had the best experience today.  I had broken my necklace, which I wear practically everyday.  I was worried that it could not be repaired.  Albert took the necklace to the back of his shop, and repaired it within 5 minutes!  I asked how much I owed them, and his wife said, nothing, have a wonderful holiday!  We were blown away with their kindness and generosity. They had beautiful pieces for sale, and I highly recommend them to everyone.  So grateful for these wonderful people!<//Review><GmapID>0x80e82ff2370a7337:0x3a272775c51ee2ea</GmapID>< Response>

<text>I've been going to Albert for over a decade. Everything from watch batteries to various chain repairs and shortening to finding the perfect wedding band he had made to go with my engagement ring a few years ago. Always quality work, great customer service, and they remember their customers! I live 45 min away now, but still go in to see him when I need stuff done, or to get my rings cleaned better than they ever get done at home or other places!</text><Name>Kristin Schultz<//Name><user>116740949779772498206<//user><resp>None< /resp><rate>5</rate><pics>None</pics>< gmap_id>

<rating>5< /rating><review>My first visit to Alberts was a repair. I was so impressed with the pricing and service I knew when the time came to make a purchase, Albert's would be my first stop. I just purchased two necklaces with pendants for my daughter and me. Lisa and Albert were both helpful and patient as we took our time choosing from the HUGE selection. I did not expect them to have so many choices. They recommended amazing chains which are very durable yet still "girly." He even fixed my daughters bent ring while we were deciding. I will never buy jewelry anywhere else. A great value for top quality stones.</review>< pictures>

If you were to go to Albert's and Lisa's  jewelry  in Thousand Oaks you
could get Albert to make you your engagement ring with the crossing
hands that I like and have him mount two 1/2 carat blue white diamonds
on it all custom made just for you.How about that just for you !💕💞< /review>

The place lets it’s friends open for whoever is preforming. The people who you are forced to listen to before the person you actually paid to go watch are horrible. They were being super rude to the audience, saying stuff like “if y’all don’t make some noise for us, the artist you actually want to see won’t come out” or “we will make you wait longer if you don’t get excited”. I waited two and a half hours until the artist I paid for came out!! Also it was winter and the stage area was super hot</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>This used to be my favorite venue on earth, but after my last few visits and the experiences my friends have had performing there, I will actively avoid this place. Not allowing band members backstage because they aren’t 21 when they are performing and making YOU money (there isn’t a bad back there, don’t see a problem), staff following people into the bathroom, imposing ridiculous rules that completely ruined our night. Heard it’s under new management, so maybe that’s why it has changed so much. Sad. Hopefully something changes.< /Text>< Pics>

<Text>I bought my daughter tickets to a concert there. When she got there, they charged her $5 because she was under 21. They wouldn’t accept her ticket til she paid. This is outrageous and illegal! After reporting this practice the management sent me a letter berating me and telling me they would send me the $5 back if I would go get educated! Hahaha what a bunch of hacks.

This place is a nightmare. It deserves zero stars. The bathrooms are always beyond disgusting. The staff is rude and sometimes mean. The stage area is always ridiculously hot, no matter the season. And the drinks are over priced and water-downed. If you think that it's the only place to see the show you want, I suggest driving somewhere out of reach, because it's worth the effort.</Text>

Performers and music lovers alike, avoid this venue at all costs.  They DO NOT pay touring acts, and double-dip charging customers for show entrance when they've already bought tickets.  Shady business practices like this are the benchmark of a short-lived venue.</Review>

Bought tickets to a show drove from Texas and I got an email an hour before show time that it was canceled & only got the service fee refunded. Highly disappointing.<//review>

(Translated by Google) Disco in Santa Barbara for people over 18 years old, although anyone can enter. If you say you don't have the ID you pay more but they let you in. Small room and unbelievably hot but it was fun

Torero Stadium is a nicely designed, intimate sports venue on the campus of the University of San Diego. It holds just over 6000, making it adequate for college, high school and smaller professional sports. It is the current home of the San Diego Loyal SC of the USL (United Soccer Leagues) Championship. One thing to note, it is all concrete, so invest in a good, thick cushion.< /text>

The event I went to was part of a 6 team Rugby tournament that came to the San Diego area this year.  Apparently this site is the home stadium for the San Diego Legion, a rugby team.  Not sure if all of the events have concession stands, but today there was a food truck and some other stands with goodies for sale.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>4</Rate><review>This place is an absolute blast. I only wish I knew of it sooner! The place might look a bit old but honestly I think it adds charm to it. Torero Stadium are very friendly and will take very good care of you if you take care of them. Kind of questionable characters on the free days but other than that it's a 100% blast to be here!< /review>< resp>

I was there to watch the SD Legion play. I have a bad back so the steel benches we're really rough to sit on for 3 hours. Otherwise, it was a beautiful Stadium. I would think with all the money that university has, they can get a larger Jumbotron.< /review>

Nice stadium. Great place to watch Rugby. Traffic in area very congested and exit from parking structure took a while. Security was telling traffic to do the opposite of what the police directing traffic were doing.<//Review>

Great place to watch rugby!
San Diego Pro Rugby had their home games here, for their one year of existence.
International Rugby USA vs Canada will be soon</Review>

<Rating>2<//Rating><Review>This place is not the best party supply store for their lack of organization, high prices, and check out practices.

To start off, they got me with the free parking. I should have known that nothing is free. I saw the sign and thought it would be great. As soon as I walked in I saw how disorganized the place was. The line was already taking up an aisle of the store and boxes where open everywhere. The next issue where the prices, when I know for a fact that other stores had similar pinatas for $15 this place had them starting at 20 and 25 for the two I grabbed. With guilt for already parking there I decided to eat the cost. Several candy and items where similarly very high priced, so this is not the place to come get a bargain. Bedies, the employees grabbing pinatas where kind and helpful even through they didn't have a single clue where any character pinata was. There was zero organization and they were constantly being followed by 4 to 5 customers asking where specific pinatas where.

The biggest issue was a result of the cashier. For such a big warehouse with customers packed like rats along the aisles you would think they would have more than one cashier or their fastest person. The opposite, they had a guy who was comically slow if it wasn't for the 40 minute line wait I had to endure. This was like a SNL sketch, he would scan items and when he didn't know he would ask the owner "Kennia" and then repeat the price to the customer who obviously heard her. They really need to get someone that can check the customers out quickly and efficiently so the store can clear out. Last but most importantly they imposed a made up fee on my cc for using a certain card. They said they were being charged that by the credit card, and they were passing the charge onto me. As a merchant that is the cost of doing business, you don't punish me for paying with legal tender in credit card form.

If you are looking for party supplies at a reasonable price, avoid this tourist trap. The free parking comes out more expensive with their unreasonably high prices and credit card fees.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

Love going to this street! Reminds me of Mexico, smell of food, food stands. You need to take your time finding a parking space. Dont use the $10 or more for parking. Take your time you will find a parking space by the curb lot cheaper.<//review>

<Text>Great customer service ! If your having a difficult time finding items for the theme of your event they'll do whatever is possible on their end to help you get or create what you need for your event; such as centerpieces and pinatas. I had a week to get what I needed and they got it done for me within that time frame!! And their pricings are very fair .< /Text><Name>dalia landa< /Name><date>1602133226913< /date><Response>None<//Response></record></dataset><record>

<review>Very helpful staff, great parking in a very busy downtown LA area. Many choices of supplies to choose from and great prices. They even told me buy two more of an item to get wholesale price and save $50 on getting 12 items instead of the 10. I'll difinitly come by shopping here for my Event Planning Business.</review><name>Elena Escalera<//name>< Response>

<text>Parking is hard to find on weekend but the selection of party favors are huge. We weren't able to get all the letter helium balloons though. That section was pretty messy and the staff pretty much said what's out is already out.<//text>< pictures>

Kennia has a great variety of character items.  We recently purchased about $300 worth of Mario Brothers decorations with prices comparable to Amazon. On top of that Kennia gave us another discount. Thank you Kennia!< /Review>

Very nice staff that are eager to help find what you are looking for in terms of pinatas. The rest of the store is filled with everything  else you might need for a party.</text>

Parking is always hard. But once inside the selection of party supplies is extensive. Dora to Mickey to marvel. Cups, plates, forks, balloons, paper products even candy and chocolate can all be found in these themes and various sizes. Very friendly staff. Helped me out trying to locate LOL doll material for my daughters party. Must see place. Save time and ask at front for specific theme to get pointed in right direction.</review>

I can't wait until they start to make their own! The candy here is a bit more expensive, but they have a collection that has stuff I've never seen anywhere else before. It's the only place that I know that sells grapefruit gummies and grapefruit infused caramel chocolate bars in the City!< /review>< user>

(Translated by Google) In the photos it looks very beautiful but if you are under the buildings it is very dirty, because there are many stalls, garbage, and there is dirty water on the sidewalk and in the street. Well I don't like it but everyone has different opinions.

(Original)
En las fotos se mira muy bonito pero si estás abajo de los edificios está muy sucio, porque ay mucho puestos, basura, y ay agua sucia en la banqueta y en la calle. Bueno yo no me gusta pero cada quien tiene diferentes opiniones.</review>

Came here for Wine Wednesday and had a blast on the happy hour specials... enjoyed some vino and the boilermakers (Pilsner + Bourbon)... my friend had a classy gin based well and lavish pizza bread.... she was in love with it... as most pizza lovers are...

The Oak and Vine is a very mood lit... has great music and even better service.

They do wine flight specials after 9pm and have a vegan option or two on the menu. A lot of stuff can be made vegan or is vegan friendly, but they don't have a major item aside from olives.

Parking is pretty decent and nearby as there are a couple shared lots that are extremely walkable... street p is rare... but they don't validate.

Overall recommend this place for any type of hang as they have ales, brew and beverages of all kinds.</text>

<review>Stopped in recently after a long time away and feel back in love with the Oak and Vine.

A party for six quickly turned into a party for two with all the holiday traffic, but there is parking very close by in a structure unfortunately O & V don't validate.

This wine bar bistro has amazing ambience a great happy hour and lots of pairing eats. Not many vegan options (sigh) but some things that can be made vegan friendly with a heads up.

Drinks are stiff however wonderful. We had amazing service (Ben is the best) and mostly great drinks not a fan of the house red (Cupcake) but do love their wine flight special after 9pm.

Definitely make a reservation if you're in a large party as seating inside and on the patio is limited and they will and want to accommodate you.</review>< pics>

Came here on a Saturday night to enjoy jazz, and we were not disappointed! The musicians were amazing. Simply tremendous! However, it took a while to hear them play because the server who greeted us didn’t know when the music would start. It would have been nice to know it started at 930pm versus 8-830pm like we were told on the phone.

The flatbread pizzas were good but seemed to be made from canned ingredients and pre-made bread.  No problem. Just don’t charge $12 for it. I’d suggest eating before you come.

The wine menu is very good. The options have been selected with care. Obviously, the prices are higher, but you can find some good options here. Beers are $8, which seems excessive considering most of the options. The cocktails are beautiful and prepared with the utmost care. Treat yourself to one since the price is only slightly higher than other options.

Overall: This is a solid establishment with potential. At present, their price-point is excessive, but the combination of setting, drinks, and great music is there. The management just needs to figure out how to make it sing!<//review>

This place has an awesome decor. A bit crowded, given how small the place is, but the happy hour selection is decent. The drink menu is a little short, but the food options are pretty good.  Has a great ambiance for a date or very intimate setting.  Do not count on bringing a group of people here though.  Even 4 people is going ton present a problem.</Text>

Things might seem slightly overpriced at first, but it's a gorgeous venue in a prime location. Hence, it does some roaring business with the happy hour and after-work crowd.< /Review>

Great place for wine and cocktails.  Some nights have live music. Ambiance is nice, and they have friendly staff. They do serve food however options are limited. Think of it as something to snack on while having drinks.  Good for first dates or meeting up with friends.</Text>

I've been to this local bar/club a few times. The DJ have played decent music every-time I've been. I was there last night to celebrate a friends birthday. The drinks were well poured and bartenders were pretty attentive and quick. Best part was that there was a Free cover for checking in!!!<//review>

Happy hour: Old fashion was way to sweet had to send it back. Sent it back for a Moscow mule and I tasted 0 alcohol. Ambiance was cool, food was good. Obviously the moral of the story is I shouldn't have ordered cocktails at a WINE bar just because they were on the happy hour 🤷‍♂️< /review>

Neither was good enough to return. But the services is very much on point!< /review><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

I loved everything I tried (which might be why I got so hammered), and the food was very tasty and presented very nicely. We came with a humongous party and sort of took over the entire upstairs area, and the staff was very accommodating with us.

Can't complain about anything! Will definitely come here again.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>A cozy atmosphere with great live music available on Saturday nights. There's outdoor seating available and the bar gives you a very rustic vibe. What's a nice upstairs where you can watch the live music or a downstairs bar where you can enjoy the music without being surrounded by it, the bar has everything you need for a good talking on your Saturday night. With convenient parking nearby and lots of nightlife around, there is no reason why this bar shouldn't be successful and all they do, and it shows.</text><gmapID>0x80c2c0fe35991585:0xc4d5534ccb6f12b2<//gmapID>< response>

< Review>
My wife and I had an amazing night here last Wednesday, they have live music most nights and we decided to try their Flatbread Pizzas - they were amazing, and such a light base so you don't feel guilty !
Alex looked after us but all the staff were really friendly, I think the previous reviewer must have just been in on an off night - I guess it happens sometimes.
We will certainly be back again very soon !< /Review>

<text>I used to love this place, but I would never go back here again because I am so angry with the service I received. Last Friday on 10/9/15 my boyfriend and I were walking down the Brand strip of Glendale. My boyfriend has just moved to CA, and Left Coast Wine Bar was one of the many places I had talked about that i'd like to take him too, especially since we live 5 mins away, so we went in so he could check it out. We get to the bar to order a couple of beers, the woman behind the bar who was checking our ID's walked away and stood in the corner as she pulled out her phone. We were very confused as to what she was doing with her phone and his ID in the back corner of the bar. Finally about 5 mins later she comes back and says "Yeah i'm not going to accept that". Very confused as to why she wouldn't accept his ID we asked her, and she said it looks photoshopped. I instantly pointed out several ways you can tell an ID is real for example the state crest which shines if you turn the ID in the light. I also explained to her that I realize she is not used to seeing an ID from Arizona, but that this is what the State ID looks like. After arguing for some time, we finally took the ID back and enjoyed ourselves elsewhere on Brand where we passed along our horrible experience at Left Coast. One bartender even scanned the ID after we told her and of course it said it was real. Left Coast, you seriously need to educate your employees on identifying real or fake IDs or GET A SCANNER! Or you can just lose all business from people with out of State IDs.</text>< Rate>

<text>What a nice surprise. We just moved back into town and had a Boba craving. We happened to be re-exploring and stumbled into the Boba Cafe. As soon as you walk into their clean and quaint location you are transported into a nice and minimalist setting. Their macaroons are popular and sell out quickly. Their drinks are delicious with a variety of flavors to choose from. We have returned multiple times to quench our craving.</text>< gmap_id>

<review>The drinks are great and though they do tend to get pretty busy sometimes, the service is quick and friendly. I did come here often before the outbreak and it was cozy inside and nice to hang out with friends. I really can't wait until this is all over so I can enjoy a Thai tea or taro smoothie inside again.</review><user>113293268478239904236< /user>< rate>

Love the boba here! We usually get fruit smoothies with Boba. I love how they always have the boba warm. Macarons are good as well. Our favorite smoothie is the strawberry and mango smoothie with Boba. Would totally recommend them! Also, of you have s business card, theres a place for them here.< /text>

My husband has been stopping in here on his lunch for a while now & suggested we try it. I took the kids in & we love it. Great drinks, great prices. The young lady that works here is sweet as can be & very helpful. Its a clean place. Don't be fooled by the outside building!</Review>

Order the honeydew smoothie with boba. You will not be disappointed. The girls working were also very nice. The place is beautifully decorated. Very clean. It was worth the extra few minute drive. We ordered 3 macaroons as well. The raspberry one was excellent. The matcha one was underwhelming. I will definitely be going back.< /Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>To start it off the total was 30$ for 5 macarons and 1 slushy and 1 boba drink. 2nd the boba drink I got was taro and it barely had flavor and there was only five boba balls in it like- tf? 3rd 4 macarons were hard and didn’t take good at all only 1 out of all five wasn’t hard and actually tasted good. Horrible experience never coming again. I suggest if u want good boba to go to  ravine donut and icecream they had so much flavor and gave so much fresh boba.< /Text>< Pics>

I don't really like leaving bad reviews but this was the worst milk tea/boba that ive ever tried. So disappointed 😞 😔  Bought 5 drinks last night since Ive been craving milk tea since we moved around the area 2 weeks ago. Unfortunately, all the 5 drinks are still in my fridge. My daughter and I couldn't finish even 1 drink it so sad. This was the only legit boba place I saw and I was also impressed by their Instagram page but the quality and taste is really bad. Hard boba and milk tea tastes like water, even the macarons were hard. Definitely not authentic like those in Ktown and OC area. We only buy food out once a week and I cant believe I spent $50 of our budget here 😭😭😭 Lesson learned the hard way.<//text>

<Review>Nice place to grab a delicious drink and maybe a snack. My daughter and son like coming to grab their drinks. And the macaroons are so delicious. Their boba is amazing. The price is well worth it. One the best parts is that this shop is privately own.  The place is always clean and very friendly.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Very delicious and fresh whole fruits flavors (not sugar junk mix). The macaroons are lovely, large and soft. We will be back. I did remove 1 star because the outside of the store has lots of trash and scattered of old clothing/homeless camp debris, un-kept.
Also the price is pretty high for each macaroons (even in bulk buy dozen). Drink prices are good/equal to Starbucks price but yummier. Store inside is clean and nice. Customer service is great.<//review>

If you love Quicklys (smoothies/slushies/bobas) you know that Victorville is lucky, because we now have Sakura Boba👍🏻😋.

The place was nice and clean; ASMR 😉
The people ( two employees) greets you as soon as you walk into the store.
You can order to go or simply stay and chill at their cute Cafe and enjoy your drink.
Pricing is reasonable.

You can get the smoothie after you eat your El Pollo Loco or Samurai Sushi 👍🏻🤣.

I love the taste of the smoothies, friendly staff and clean Cafe.

Thank you Sakura Cafe for my refreshing smoothies 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟❤🥑👍🏻😋.</text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNoy6q-ynRr4d6gjeCKKjiEZEb41IrnZrJlvL5F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM68BTCoBgQVJnE0ZWO8uul-gyJriZu793OiCob=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNJinhVlqKD0sM-RmCbfpjLX0LAVj3J1KxqY2aR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN-Uhh_mHMIiPEAhGOiFONaDWq0a3t7OaobPxkZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOTbr3pQsbZDayDnfxW44S-ymuh5TybSRZ-srzR=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP1ZB9kkFt0IH8pFkHsNHhumeA8hSn3TIkTl1mD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNMvLouN1nqkYcCJcuUxYzcAM77biUBWF6vCG9p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPg5PFY9h6qW1qbU8oFWJuaMq6d_MSk3cUu_Ti3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP0w41TCAif6cbIQSfsZ8rLSJh0RZ4Zg7CWApsk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Good things:
- employees friendly and attentive
- clean and bright, nicely decorated

Not so good things:
- tea isn't strong, on the watery end
- mango slush was already separated by the time I got home
- location is tucked away although there was signage that helped</Text>

<review>My very first time there. Place is very nice. I waited 10 minutes for someone to assist me. Two girls were there and they’re very unorganized. After I place my order I waited another 30 minutes to get my order and let me tell y’all it was NOT worth it .  Very disappointed!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I've come in a couple times because it's hard to find boba up here in the high desert. My smoothie is always watery the boba has absolutely no sweetness and sometimes tastes old.<//Text>

< Review>
Neat atmosphere and Great customer service. The boba was a bit old and all our drinks tasted watered down. Almost no boba places in the High Desert, so hoping this place does well.

Edit: After a few months went back. Drinks where heavily watered down, boba wasn't that bad and customer service was great.

All in all wont go back as the drinks arent good.< /Review>

I never knew about this place until I saw some ads for it in the sushi place next door but I was excited to find a good boba place in my area. First off this place is crazy cute inside and the workers are super friendly and just genuinely upbeat. They have so many flavors to choose from and so far the green tea and the lavender lemonade were delicious. Can’t wait to come back and just wanted to give this place some recognition</Text>

Depending on the workers that is working my drinks taste different . it's not sweet and taste bland i think they need to get better with making the drinks . and they don't accept $50 or $100 kind of stupid . i had drank enough boba to know how it's supposed to taste like . i guess as they got more customers they don't care the taste ?</Text>

<review>Not a good place to go if you're looking for your typical boba drinks. The only good things worth getting are their slushies especially the watermelon one since it's made with real watermelon.< /review>< name>

<Review>I have been a long time customer of Valley Oak Home Appliance Center. I strongly believe in supporting local businesses. Valley Oak listens and definitely works with their customers. I appreciate the fact that they care about the quality they sell their customers rather than selling something that won't last. I also appreciate their patience. Having a broken appliance can be stressful. Thank you Valley Oak Appliances!</Review>< GmapID>

< Review>
We bought all new appliances from valley oak when we moved into our new house. We thought buying from a local place would mean that we would get good service. We were very wrong. We've had nothing but problems with this company. We have had to have service calls for two different appliances because they were installed incorrectly. And each time the service person came out and fixed the issue he was surprised that they were installed so poorly. The final straw was when our new but just out of warranty dishwasher broke. The service person said it would take a $500 repair in a 6-week wait for a part and they just assumed that we would pay that when a brand new dishwasher is not much more expensive. We ended up contacting the manufacturer ourselves and discovered that this was a common faulty issue and that they were covering it free under an extended warranty. Valley oak made no mention of knowing that this was a common problem nor that there was an extended warranty that the manufacturer was covering. We ended up getting it fixed by a different local company that provided exceptional customer service and all of the costs were covered by the manufacturer. I'll never return to valley oak. I think it's awful that we spent so much money with this company and they treated us like this. I cannot recommend them</Review>

Our dishwasher, oven and microwave all decided to quit this year and we needed a second refrigerator. We shopped in the big box stores but finally came to Valley Oak Home Appliance.
Tim who is the general manager provided us with options and helped us find the best package that fit our needs. He arranged for delivery and installation that came through timely and cost less than the big box stores. He also helped us fill out the rebate forms!
Desi was a pro with installing and revising the cabinet for the microwave and oven.
Overall, excellent customer experience and service and definitely recommend them.</review>

<Text>I would highly recommend this company. Eric the Tech that came out for our refrigerator went above and the beyond. He discovered our Refrigerator was recalled and through his hard work and phone calls, got our parts covered by the manufacturer. He saved us 778 dollars in parts. This company and its techs are very knowledgeable and deserve this 5 start rating. I will recommend them to everyone I know. Thank you again..<//Text><Rate>5<//Rate></record>

<review>Sure, the washing machine and dryer are fantastic. It is, however, the service, that makes this purchase stand out for my family and me. Their technicians are knowledgable, honest, professional and even personable. They are quick, but they are also problem solvers when the laundry area has some quirks of its own. We have such a wonderful laundry experience in large part, because of the machines they sold us; it is in larger part, because of our experience of Valley Oak Home Appliance Center's people. Thank you!</review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

I called every appliance and part store from Stockton to Sacramento. Everyone told me it was unavailable., discontinued, or 2-3 weeks out if i ordered it. I spoke to Mario C. and he made my jaw drop when he told me that they had the part and that he would even pull it and place it at the counter for me. I was skeptical but drove the 15 minutes north. When i arrived i was greeted by Mario. He had my part ready. Even took the time to track down the hardware that i needed to complete the job.

<review>So impressed with the service received by master technician, Fletcher on some warranty work performed today. Our new build home came with standard contractor grade appliances & have had 2 service calls made in less 6 months we’ve owned it. Fletcher arrived, on time with booties already on. His friendly & professional demeanor reflected went above & beyond our expectations. A far cry from our first service call from another co where their tech asked me for glue & said any kind would do. But Fletcher knew otherwise & used a high temp glue to adhere a rubber bumper on the foot of our cooktop grate. Fletcher elaborated on the life expectancy of our subpar (my words) appliances. He invited us to come to his companies showroom where we would be treated right, get what we want at comparable prices. The company has been around for 28 years & want to support our local merchants who make that extra effort as we experienced today.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Like everyone in a small town, when we call for something like appliance repair we expect a guy to show up late with his overalls and german sheperd, lay his greasy tools all over the floor and work forever and never get it freally fixed. Valley Oak was such a relief. Not only did they get there when they said they would but they called about 15 minutes before to let us know they were on the way. No dogs or greasy tools just a professional looking fellow who was courteous, knowledgeable and worked quickly and efficiently to repair in this case our clothes washer. And it's remained fixed. Valley Oak is the only repair service we use from now on.<//Review>

My dryer needed service and When I called a very polite and friendly person made the appointment for just a few days later.  I even received a reminder call the day before.  The technician arrived on time and made the repairs.  The price was much less expensive than I thought.  I will continue to use this company for service and also will buy my next appliance there.  Great job Valley Oak!<//Text>

Great customer service in the store Dana and Mario are super helpful and patient which it works when you don't know the precise name for the part you're looking for. They give you guarantee on all the items you purchase. The prices are a little more but it's worth it... Unless you like yo go to the big name store and be there looking for that one part for your appliances.< /review>

<review>My boyfriend and I ordered a refrigerator a week before Thanksgiving. We were promised it the week after Thanksgiving. It has not arrived yet and I had to call to find out an update about the refrigerator.  Finally they said it's being made and will be here after Christmas.

We have had to replace three of our major appliances in the past three months. We have purchased and replaced them with Valley Oak Appliance items. The first to go was my dryer in May 2014, my washer in June 2014, and my refrigerator in August 2014. I have had the same repairman (Logan) install each of my appliances and he did a wonderful job. He took time to demonstrate how to use each item, gave me time to clean under the item after he moved the old one out, and was polite and very knowledgeable about each appliance. He had Dmitri with him for the refrigerator and he was just as helpful and polite. I would recommend either of these men for any job at Valley Oak Appliance.<//Text>

I recently bought a refrigerator from Valley Oak Appliance. I was so impressed by the sales staff. They were knowledgeable and patient to make sure I was getting the best refrigerator for me. They didn't try to pressure me or rush me like Home Depot. I am extremely happy with my purchase and would highly recommend Valley Oak Appliance to everyone.</Text>

<Text>I had an infected molar that needed to be extracted, and I was able to receive an appointment right away. Even thought they did not take my insurance (Delta Dental through Kaiser), I went anyway because of their reviews, and they were close to my home.  The cost was not bad, and the extraction was fine.  Since it was infected he gave me a prescription for Penicillin, for about 10 days.  I will be going back, to get my teeth cleaned so I don't have to have anymore teeth pulled.<//Text><pics>None<//pics>< UserId.>

< review>
I went to Dr. Wood some months back to have a tooth pulled and a bone graft in preparation for an implant. Yesterday Dr. Wood installed the implant insert which was performed without pain and with little discomfort. I have not experienced any swelling nor bleeding nor pain since and am very happy with the experience. Dr. Wood has a caring and professional staff and I would recommend him to others.

As always the care and attention I receive from Wood Family Dentistry is awesome.  I love having Mary as my dental hygienist, she's very thorough and does a great job on the teeth cleaning.  Dr. Wood is great too, tells me what is needed and what can be put off till later which I really appreciate.  All in all, you can't go wrong choosing Wood Family Dentistry for your dental needs.</text>

<Text>Dr. Wood and Sue were friendly, professional, thorough, and yet fun as I got my teeth cleaned last week, as usual. Who gets to laugh so often in the dentist’s chair?? Dr. Wood’s patients, that’s who!! I’ve never in 20 years had less than a great experience there. We’ve had dental care for four, orthodontic care for two and Invisalign for one, and I highly recommend this dental office.
P.S. He recommended against replacing my lightly chipped crown, saying that its seal was fine and that the chip was only visible to someone looking into my wide open mouth. That saved me an unneeded expense even when I was perfectly willing to pay it.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x809ae6a99c980fb3:0x8a0f23c236733bf5</Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It's official - our whole family of 4 are now going to Wood Family Dentistry! My husband and I have been going since we moved to the area, over 20 years ago. If you want a safe, professional experience, where you can trust you'll never be ripped off or misinformed, this is it. I still get compliments on my teeth, figured it was finally time to write a review!</Text>

<Text>I'm pretty anti-dentite, and haven't been for about 8 years. Things have changed a lot. Can honestly say this was the easiest dental exam/xrays I have ever had and I'm no spring chicken... Dr. Wood was very nice and informative. He explained the few issues I have and made recommendations but also not at all pushy about getting the work done. I would highly recommend Dr. Wood and his team. The staff were all awesome as well.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<review>This dental office was a game changer for me. Saved me $2K and a potential pulled tooth on my first visit (bad diagnosis from Smile Care Dental in Folsom).

Always fast, efficient, clean and professional.

They also use every current known technology so I am always advised correctly.

I do not even have insurance, but I go to them regularly, I trust them fully!< /review></record>

<text>I absolutely love Dr.Wood and his whole team! You won't find a better dentist. You just won't. I swear 90% of the time I am in there getting work done I am laughing so hard. There is just a happy friendly vibe. Dr.Wood checks in with me right before starting to use the tools, "You doing ok?" he asks. It's the small gestures that add up and help me see how much they all care. I like to think I am a comedian, and Dr. Wood puts up with my jokes. That right there earns them all 1million stars. These are good people. If you know the value of genuine, then you will understand when I say this is the best dentistry. In less than a month's time I had 6 cavities filled. First session we did 3, and then I went back to do the other 3 a few weeks later... what to know the weird part?!? I was excited to go back to do the last 3. WTH?!?! If I were asked to list some of his skills I would put; bedside manner, ability to give shots like a champ, all the other dentist stuff, and verifying his work. The hygienists, assistants, and front end staff are also amazing. Thank you so much to all of you at Wood Family Dentistry. I hope I never have another cavity, but if I do... I know I am in great hands.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1603914975841, 'text': 'Thank you Melissa for your kind words.

Love this dental office!! Very clean and professional and have down to earth people working there. They care about your oral health, as well as your personal life. One of the hygienists gave me an idea for my honeymoon and it made the trip even more special. Highly recommend using this dental office for yourself and your entire family. Support a local family owned business for your oral care.</text>

I am so happy I found this practice. Dr. Wood and his staff are wonderful. They are all really welcoming, knowledgeable and located in an older, converted charming home. It reminds me of my old dentist before I moved. They also have tv screens above each chair so there isn't any awkward silence. If they are in your provider network, I highly recommend checking out.<//review>

The hygienist was gentle, efficient and friendly. I would highly recommend this dental practice. The dentist is my cousin so I've known him for a long time but he is as good a dentist as his father, my uncle, who was my dentist as a child. Very up-to-date office with good staff. I don't have time to waste looking for a good dentist and this office, dentist and staff was superb!< /review>

I love my Wood family Dentistry, as the name says, yes it is part of my family, they really take good care of you teeth and are very professional and courteous. My whole family after I told about how good and patient oriented they are , the family changed their Dentist and are now with Wood Family Dentistry for past 7 years and love them.
I would like to give KUDOS to my dental nurse Mrs. Mary who is very professional and  knowledgeable. I am a 10 year old customer with Wood Dentistry and would recommend to all to try out once Dr. Wood and see the difference.
Wishing you all happy holidays & Merry Christmas!!<//text>

Wonderful, friendly staff - and great experience. Very fair, honest and realistic - feels like home, the office is a house building so it doesn't feel so clinical.  Clean, professional and great service.  I would highly recommend< /review>

I was at another dental office for over 27 years. The dentist sold his practice and I to find a new dentist. Mind you this is the same dentist for years. I loved my dentist so finding a new one was scary. It is like finding a new husband after being married for years lol. My friend works for Dr. Wood and said come give him a try. I had a tooth ache and they got me in asap and I just loved my experience. They were so welcoming warm and  knowledgeable.
The entire staff and Dr. were fantastic. If you are looking for a dentist, I would highly recommend Wood Family Dentistry .</text>

My Invisalign procedure was flawless. I started seeing the results within 3 weeks, and after 10 weeks my teeth were where they needed to be. No gap in the front teeth, and it was much easier to chew. Dr. Wood is a top notch dentist.< /review>

<Review>Wood Family Dentistry is an excellent practice. I've been a patient of his for close to 15 years and I've recommended him to family and friends. The environment is always comfortable and Dr. Wood is very professional.< /Review><gmap_id>0x809ae6a99c980fb3:0x8a0f23c236733bf5</gmap_id><user>100054968060846635473< /user>< Rating>

Having moved from a small town where my previous dentist was family oriented I was searching for a dentist who shared the same values. I found that at Wood Family Dentistry. From the nice early morning greeting to the thorough cleaning, I am always felt weclomed. I am fortunate to have found a practice that can accommodate my work schedule with an EARLY appt. Thank Wood Family Dentistry for your service, it is truely appreciated. Oh and BTW I always love my goody bag:)< /text>

<Review>Wood Family Dentistry does whatever it takes to give their patients the best care possible. I once had a bad tooth ache and I called the office to inform them and I was seen the next day. The cleanings and other work I have done is great as well. All in all, this is a great practice.< /Review><Time>1447270912092</Time>< Resp>

< Review>
Our experience living at Aire has been incredible so far! The staff is super friendly, transparent, and always looking out for what's best for you and the community. The neighborhood is safe and family-friendly. HUGE shoutout to the maintenance and grounds-keeping team for their professionalism and promptness. I'd highly recommend Aire to any friend or family looking to find a place to call Home!<//Review>

<user>115000045179294107182<//user>< review>
I've been living in a studio apartment for about 6 months at Aire now. I'm a single bachelor in my mid-late 20s working in tech and enjoying the outdoors. It's the cheapest studio I found when searching North San Jose and the greater Santa Clara area. The unique design offers a divider between the resting and lounge/relaxation area, which compartmentalizes the unit making it feel less overwhelming.

Thus far, it's been a wholesome positive living experience. I live on the 2nd floor, steps away from the garbage/recycling chute (which is a separate room on its own), from my parking location (via stairs) and the amenities - lounge, pool, gym, which are all of utmost quality. The apartment is fairly isolated from any noise in the hallways. The demographic is mainly young couples or families from what I've observed.

I haven't had any major technical issues. My fire alarm unit became detached suddenly, but all I had to do was e-mail management and they fixed it asap when they did their routine inspection. Paperwork and payments are all done via online (make sure to register your bank account/chequings to avoid unnecessary processing fees for e.g. if you paid via credit card).

Although the staff are busy, they are friendly and competent - I've had wonderful interactions with Shokhou and Taylor, who've been prompt in helping me answer any questions, any requests (for e.g. getting keys to Internet hub room for Internet service provider technicians for Internet set-up), or provide me any necessary paperwork. Most of all, they've been gracious in helping me with my transition from Canada to San Jose via remote communication over the phone, from the self check-in instructions on a weekend night, to any follow-up inquiries I had.

Simply, Aire is a wicked place to live. :)<//review>

<Review>The outstanding condition of the community’s features, amenities and apartments were of course the main selling point for us but it was the friendliness of the leasing agents and their willingness to help, that really closed the deal for us. Aire is the best apartment community in the region.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

I stayed at Aire for four years and highly recommend living there. The apartments are very modern and the building is new. The complex is smaller than those around it which gives it a nice community feel. The staff does a really great job - the premises are extremely clean (they wipe down elevators, doors etc multiple times per day due to COVID 19) and very pretty. The apartment manager (Jack) is very professional, friendly, and easy to work with. Aire is very quiet, the residents are very respectful of one another. Check out Aire - it’s  really one of a kind community in this area.<//Text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><text>I've decided to write this review after a year I moved out after a couple of friend still in the area asked about my experience

-The apartments and common areas are nice but the management is awful.
-There is always something wrong with the elevators, get ready to carry your groceries for 5 floors.
-There is a construction going on and the noise and dirty are really annoying, I'm not sure is is done by now.
-Once they increased our rent at the end of the contract and surprisingly we found out they were offering the same a apartment at a cheaper price for new costumers:
-They just try to attract more residents but they clearly don't take care of the people already living there.
-The fire alarm used to started ringing in the middle of the night at least once a month.
Our bike was stolen with almost every other bike at the bike room.

It was hard to find the leasing office open

Cleaning and maintenance staff I must say is very good, but they seemed to also struggled with their own management.<//text>< name>

I’ve lived in this community since 2015 and cannot say enough great experiences I’ve had here. The apartments are modern with great layouts. I never hear noises from my neighbors which I attribute to the highest level of construction. The leasing team are attentive and accommodating and as are the maintenance team. Neighbors are friendly and courteous. I would highly recommend this apartment complex.< /Text>

Moved in a week ago and everything has been absolutely wonderful! The apartments are sleek, modern, well-maintained, and very comfortable. The surrounding area is gorgeous for San Jose, with trees and a park right across the street from the complex. When in the process of looking and applying here, Carina was extremely helpful, thorough, and quick to answer any questions. Both she and Jack have made this a smooth and easy move and I'm extremely happy to call this home -- Cannot recommend this place enough!</review>

The community is so beautiful and modern . They have stainless steal appliances in all apartments which is amazing . River Oaks Park is right across the street which is a plus. It’s a smaller community and everyone seems friendly. I had so many questions during my tour and Carina answered them all. She followed up with me right away and responded fairly quickly. Great experience and amazing staff .</Review>

We have been renting in different apartments/complexes. This means we have worked with several community management groups. But we have had a very vary pleasant experience with Berkshire Community group, especially The Rey apartments in San Diego and the Aire apartments in San Jose. I will explain why/how. We were renting in the Aire in San Jose and we still had 6 months to the end of my lease that we had to move to San Diego due to job relocation. However, the management in the Aire (Marzieh) was kindly helped us through the process of re-renting from the other Berkshire community group in San Diego (The Rey) to avoid paying any extra fee. Further, they didn't deduct unreasonable amount from our deposit for cleaning (actually it was the least I have ever paid and very clear charges).
At the Rey in San Diego, we had so much fun in the apartment and its amenities. Further, it was always easy to fix a little issues since the management team is VERY responsive, helpful, and responsible. Again for our second lease there was a situation that we had to break our lease and leave to different location. in this situation I was communicating with the management team (Sarah and Justin) to try to rent out our apartment ASAP to avoid paying any fee. It was not the easiest time, but again thanks to Sarah and Justin (and the whole team) we had a very smooth transitioning and our apartment was rented out in less than a week (which means we ended up paying the minimum breaking lease fee).

All in all,  we had a great time living in both Berkshire communities. I believe the main reason is that their staff are very nice and helpful and they have a great culture of customer service.</review>

To be honest, it’s been hard to find people that are willing to help us here in the Bay Area and the staff at AIRE have literally been a blessing. From the beginning of the process of moving, Corina made it so easy. She was very professional and so kind as she walked us through the rental process and made sure we had everything we needed to move. As we continued to figure out logistics,  she continued to provide help along with Jack. Even our move in day, they both continued to serve us so well, allowing us to borrow their dolly to help us cart stuff from one end of the building to the other and made sure we had everything we needed to get settled into our new home. They definitely made moving so far from home a lot easier and we can’t thank them enough for this!!

On top of having such a great experience with the staff, our apartment was beautiful and super clean. We joked that even the trash room smelled good! (But for real, it did - it smelled like cinnamon!) In addition, everyone we have encountered that lives here has also been super kind and welcoming, which just makes this place feel more like home. I would absolutely recommend living here just based on the interactions I’ve had with the staff and the tenants.</review>< Name>

Found a 1 bedroom on Thursday and we are moving in today(Saturday). Such a short period to move in could be overwhelming, but Jack Reese helped us out with everything possible and walked us through the whole process. He was very responsive as far as phone calls and emails are concerned and I am glad everything worked out just fine. I would definitely recommend Aire.<//Review>

Wish I could give zero star. Horrible management policies. No parking. You have to be on the waiting list for months and who knows how long even after. Rooms are oddly shaped. I don’t understand how the apartment reviews are good. Stay away unless you are a millionaire.</Text>

<Name>Deepankar Patra<//Name><review>They are the most unprofessional group among all we have visited. We booked an appointment beforehand and went there 5 mins before time but there were literally nobody in the leasing office. We waited there for 45 mins, called their number that rang the desk phone with nobody to pick up. We noticed there were few more disgruntled people waiting there  and ended up leaving like us.

They had a signboard hanging saying they are out on a tour and will return at 9 o'clock and it was 3pm then!

If the management is so irresponsible how would anyone trust them and stay there.< /review>< UserId.>

<rate>1</rate><text>The apartment community is new and to some extent clean, but I am warning anyone interested in renting a unit here. I just moved out of the community and here are the list of things you should consider before deciding to rent a unit here:

1- They charged me $300 for Apartment cleaning, carpet cleaning, and paint. All of the above were in excellent condition since I cleaned them myself. However, when I asked them about the fees, the answer of was as follows (quote from management):

"The cleaning and carpet cleaning are normal charges after resident moves out of the unit. When you moved in your Pat was professionally clean so when you move out we need to clean it for the next resident. Maintenance take pictures of the unit after resident move out as well. Did you pay someone to clean your unit? We need a deep cleaning and carpet cleaning. If you did pay someone to clean it please provide the receipt so I can talk to my manager about it."

This is an email they sent me yesterday! Apparently, one has to do professional cleaning before move-out!

2- The elevators are broken and out of order almost all the time. You can expect to go up and down the stairs for the most part of your stay.

3- The fire alarm goes off almost every month, not mentioning the fact that one night it went off 13 times and no one could sleep until they went to work in the morning! All of them, false alarms! Imagine what happens to those with kids

4- The management team is never in the office, and when you need to pick up your package, you have to wait for hours.

5- The walls are thin and you can hear, with no effort, your neighbor's private discussions!

6- The trash chute is really nasty and unclean.

7- Bugs are all over the place.

8- No parking for guests or people with two cars.

9- Multiple break-ins to cars! Last week they had 3 on one day!

10- No shopping or stores in the vicinity.</text>< pictures>

<Review>Very negative experience from the first minute! I don't recommend to deal with these guys. They are liars! They post fake ads on craiglist with a fake price. When I called to check the price, the management just told me everything else but the price, all the pros of the apts and benefits. They were trying to avoid my direct price question. They think that their customers are stupid.
Their craiglist posting for 1 bedroom is for 2387$ and their real price is over 2600$. They are just wasting people's time, trying to provide the better fake price and let people come to check out the apartments. Which is just waste of time.
I will never deal with such unprofessional company.<//Review>< date>

Elite is definitely in a class of its own! Dr Basi and the whole staff are GREAT!! I have been here a number of times and always feel like I am a priority to them. The location is perfect. It’s easy to find at 1524 McHenry. There ‘s an imaging facility and a lab conveniently located, only steps away, in fact.<//review>

I didn't give a five because they insisted on charging a co-pay when they were not supposed to and I've had to request reimburse from insurance..extra paperwork.  I didn't want to dispute further at the time because I needed help immediately.<//Review>< pictures>

Great customer service, the two young ladies were pretty busy with all the patients that arrived, they handled it very professionally.
My injection was quick.  4 stars only because of the wait time, but to be honest I was expecting longer.
Thank you<//Text>

One of the best Dr’s office I’ve been too. I deal with flare ups of extreme lower back pain, as soon as I walked in it was welcoming and professional. Dr Basi knew exactly what was wrong with me and to my surprise the previous doctors I saw were wrong. Dr Basi was even able to help with my pain relief and that was the first time in months I was pain free. From the staff to the Dr, best place to go in Modesto.</text>

Went in today for a Covid vaccine shot. I had gotten an appointment ahead of time. Wait time was minimal out in less than an hour, start to finish. Every one was so helpful and professional. They had the Johnson and Johnson vaccine which is what I wanted. Would recommend to everyone!</Review>

Made an appointment for an unexplained skin rash. The scheduled appointments online were super easy to confirm and I was checked in right away. Unfortunately they didn’t accept my insurance so I had no choice other than to pay out of pocket due to my nearest urgent cares not accepting walk ins and had appointments that were not available in the coming days.

Waiting for the doctor inside seemed really long, almost an hour, as I wasn’t made aware of any patients ahead of me so it felt like a long time before the doctor saw me.

Thankfully the doctor figured out right away what was going on with a quick physical exam and assured me with information on how to deal with it. Really glad that Elite Urgent Care was available last minute for me and helped to identify what I had.< /text>

<rating>2< /rating><Review>Two stars because the staff and the doctor were nice but I was there for literally three hours and went specifically for routine urine testing and they took my urine but apparently never sent it to the lab even though I discussed with the md the reason I was there and he said he would order the test and two weeks later I’ve called three times and they just tell me “your test results aren’t back yet”. So today I asked, did they even send anything out to be tested? And the nurse couldn’t find anything and asked me if I discussed with the doctor that I wanted those tests done and they legit were the only reason I went. She then put me on hold for 20 mins and never came back. Phone hung up on me. Waste of my time and a delay of care.< /Review>< pictures>

My appointment with Elite was excellent today. These skilled personnel  are friendly, they know what they’re doing and how to do it, plus they know how to make you comfortable in the process.
This is not my first time using their services.  A couple of years ago, I slipped and nearly cut my ear in half. The Dr/owner met me at his facility —way after hours—and fixed me up beautifully, I might add.  I can’t convey my gratitude and impressions highly enough and would return there in a heartbeat.< /Review>

<date>1616548094659</date><Rating>4</Rating><review>I would NOT RECOMMEND seeing the doctor/nurse practitioner with the blonde hair. I went in today for a extremely painful urinary tract infection. I've been getting them since I was 3 years old (a hereditary condition) and have taken many different antibiotics over the years. She told me that she was going to prescribe keflex for me.
I told her that it did NOT WORK for me when I had taken it before. She said to me "you have to change them up sometimes" because she couldn't or wouldn't look at what had been prescribed the last time I was given Keflex and it didn't work (Nitrofurantoin). I tried to tell her that I knew it didn't work, she kept repeating the "change it up" line, when I tried to tell her that it didn't work for me. Now, after taking the medication that she forced me to take (and pay for) - I'm at home late at night in the worst pain of my life because she wouldn't look at my records for the antibiotic (nitrofuranton) that had been prescribed and worked for me the last time  I went in. I have no idea why she wouldn't listen to me!
Dr. Basi is very good and has been very professional and thorough each time I've seen him. Some Dr's have the God complex and treat the people who they're working FOR like they're children. I may call ahead to make sure that she isn't working before I go in again. It's a shame, thought I had found a great urgent care!<//review>< pics>

<text>I love, love, love this urgent care and the caring people that work there. I fell one day and ended up with a hematoma as big as a watermelon on my leg. The swelling scared me so I made an appointment and went in for care. At the desk, I met Sharon who was a sweet, kind and professional soul that helped me through the checking in process. I am disabled and she catered to my needs and didn’t allow me to stand to check in. She let me have a seat and brought everything to me. When I went back to be checked, I met the female Dr. Basi who was very professional and knew what was wrong by sight. She ordered rest and cold packs. The swelling was diminishing but my lower foot started to swell and my foot turned red. I went back because of the new swelling and met NP Coats. She was very nice and she diagnosed me with cellulitis. She started me on antibiotics and the cellulitis stopped spreading but my feet was still swollen. She started me on Ladin and I was being seen everyday to be monitored. Then I met the male Dr. Basi. He is very professional but doesn’t have the ladies soft touch. But he was still great and he ordered me medications that finally got my swelling down. I want to mention their great office staff, Francisco and Roxanne. They were professional, caring and sweet! Anyone looking for an alternative other than being admitted to the hospital during a pandemic with professional service from beginning to end, this is definitely the place to go.< /text>< Pics>

I have been requesting the office to cancel my contract, that they claim i never applied for but they pull 75 dollars out of my bank every month for.  The reason for canceling is my contact was for my grandson. They wanted to take blood from him daily for test and never figured out what was going on. When we took him to a doctor, they said elite was wrong for what they were doing and figured out what was wrong quickly.  Save time and money. See a real doctor</text>

The wait was a little long considering I had made an appointment but the staff more than made up for it. From reception to my medical assistant they were all exceptional. I have to say though that my medical assistant (I cannot remember her name) was the kindest, most skilled and gentle I’ve ever experienced. She most definitely gets major kudos! She’s one of a kind!! Thank you for making me feel so much better!< /Review>

<Review>Hands down the most caring doctors in the Modesto area. I love that they explain everything in detail and take their time. You don't need an appointment, budget friendly (they also offer their own health plans), and nice location and building.

<text>I have no issues with the service I received from the Elite Urgent Care. The people who work there from staff to doctor were respectful. It is just difficult to wear a mask while waiting for an appointment time. I have asthma and each time I am required to wear a mask more than 30 minutes, I end up with a severe sinus infection that requires antibiotics. (in six months, I have taking more antibiotics than I have in 20 years.) If I was not required to wear a mask, I would put 5 stars. Our California governor discriminated against those with disabilities, thus making us wear a mask dangerous to endanger our health.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<text>The staff was welcoming and eager to help me during a difficult time. They worked with my Stanford physician to provide the treatment I needed quickly and effectively to prevent a ED visit or even a hospitalization. I was happy I didn't need to drive to Stanford for the urgent treatment I needed since Elite staff were highly capable of collaborating with Stanford to meet my needs close to home. I am feeling much better today!< /text>< user_id>

Very clean facility, friendly receptionists, and professional staff. I have been there twice in the past few years and am very pleased with the good care.
I like the technology—even getting a text message to let me know where I am in the queue! Awesome.
I only had one person ahead of me. I was in and out in very good time!

I highly recommend Elite Urgent Care!</Review>

<text>I have been coming to Elite Urgent Care since 2017. I have always felt listened to, respected, and receive great care from not just Dr. Basi, but everyone I have dealt with in his office! Wait times are fast considering it’s an urgent care and I am always in an out as quickly as they can. I couldn’t come to Elite for a year due to our insurance changing so as soon as we switched I called to make sure they took it that’s how happy I have been!</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

Hands down the best place to come rather than the ER or even waiting to be seen by your regular doctor. The entire staff is knowledgeable and friendly and the facility is clean and state of the art! Wait times aren't too bad and you left feeling both seen and heard.</Text>

What's the point of making an appointment if the receptionist literally just said making an appointment has no effect on the wait time?  I been here for over an hour and a half for an appointment that was supposed to be at 11:20.  Over an hour and a half later I'm still waiting. Ridiculous. The app tells me I been in front of the line for over an hour with no wait time. DONT home here! This place is a joke. I'll report this to the better business bureau.<//Text>

< Review>
I love taking my kids to Elite vs any other ER or urgent care in the area. It's super convenient and the staff is phenominal. They can do just about anything from lab work, stitches, IVs to basic antibiotics. The only negative thing for me, especially with kids...is the wait time. The lobby can be empty and you should still plan on at least an hour. Patients get called back in a timely manner but I've never spent less than an hour there, sometimes more.  I understand they have a lot of services they provide but everything just seems to take way longer than they average urgent care, even if its a basic ear infection.

The staff outweighs the wait time however for me . I took my middle boy in for a laceration to the foot..in the hectic rush to get my 8 month old and other kid dropped off on the way to urgent care, I left my wallet in the diaper bag. I thought we were stuck with no insurance card and no copay... the receptionist and doctor were awesome and allowed me to give them the information from my babysitter over the phone!</Review>

Today was our 2nd need for care and based on our 1st visit we chose to visit Elite to avoid the ER. My husband needed daily IV antibiotics and because Elite is able to provide on the spot lab results Dr. Basi was able to diagnose the problem quickly, collaborate with my husband's surgeon at UCSF and create a plan of care, my husband avoided hospitalization. We will come daily for IV antibiotics till his infection clears and spend our time in our own home to recover instead of the hospital. The staff are friendly and professional. Dr. Basi works together with us, the patient, and with the primary physician to work together for the best treatment. I appreciate this approach to optimize easy access and high quality care practice and treatment.< /Text>

Kinda don’t, want to give them such a great review, for fear of them becoming more popular and busy! In all seriousness they are amazing! Very clean! And, that is very important to me!! Thank you 😊 for your help. When I was so sick!!!< /text>

< review>
I absolutely love this clinic, I wish I could use them as my primary physician. I'm new to this area and have had very poor experiences with the healthcare system in California. They are so professional and courteous. I highly recommend them.

I've since started using elite urgent Care as my primary doctor's, they are so professional and caring, the clinic is very clean and modern. I recently went in for acute shoulder pain and they made sure they did everything they could for me and I left there feeling so much better, almost pain free. I would recommend them to everyone, the wait time is so short, and the entire office staff are so friendly and kind. Plus the office hours are worker friendly, I did't have to take time off work which is such a plus. Elite Urgent Care I can honestly say is the best clinic I have ever been to.

Update 1/02/2020

I went in today to have my prescriptions refilled, it's been a while since I've been there.
They all remember me and call me by name.
I'm still in awe of how friendly this clinic is.<//review>

I’ve come here over the past year. The doctor’s are always very helpful and make and effort to diagnose the problem. They also have equipment to take blood work to help with the diagnosis. Overall, each visit has been helpful and has been a good experience. I recommend Elite Urgent Care over others in the area.< /review>

I wasn’t sure what to expect but this facility was really nice and the staff was amazing. From the kind receptionist, to the caring medical assistant, to the kind and attentive Nurse Practioner who you could tell was really trying to figure out what was wrong with you and how to help you not just push a diagnosis and prescription on you. I would definitely recommend Elite Urgent Care and if the need to visit an urgent care arises again I know where I will be going. Thank you for what you do!<//Text>

<text>This is a great urgent care facility! They were able to treat my fiancee and had everything they needed there. Dr. Basi is very compassionate and understanding! The other staff is amazing as well. They explain everything so we understood what was being done and the charges for it.< /text>< Pics>

Always there to help when I need it. This place beats every other place in town. Waits can get long because they are always filled with people seeking help, no where to go but the ED. My service has always been great, Dr. Basi is by far the most knowledgeable guy I know. The facility looks impeccable, modern, and clean. I feel blessed to have a small business such as this to have opened in Modesto where the need is real. These the staff that works here knows what they are doing, really ELITE.<//Review>

The Dr Basi and the staff were very kind, efficient and very personable. Addressed the issues They made me feel so much better after a liter of fluids with anabiotic and nausea medicine. I wish I would’ve come here yesterday Instead of riding this out the last two days  thinking it was going to go away. If I ever feel bad again I will definitely come to elite urgent care.</Review>

<Text>Elite Urgent Care is the BEST urgent care I have been to in Modesto. I had my 3rd experience with them tonight. They had a record high number of patients tonight, but never made me feel rushed through the care process.  Normally I am in and out within an hour! Even with a higher number of patients (many were small children) they treated everyone with kindness and patience. The doctor is wonderful, caring and just an all around great doctor! The rest of the staff is equally as wonderful which is so rare to find in other urgent care facilities.</Text>< Rate>

Friendly professional staff. Will definitely recommend to others. Great bed side manners. Made me feel comfortable, and as important as the next patient. Dr. Basi was on top of my condition, and had me in CT in less than 3hrs. Elite urgent care will be my go to place, if ever I need quick care in the future.<//review>

The staff is very pleasant and knowledgable when asked questions. The clinic was moderately busy when I was there and wait time didn't even exist! I was in and out. The urgent care has their own lab and right next to Modesto Radiology, they have same day access to X-ray. I got the full work up and felt really secure in my treatment and diagnosis. Dr. Basi is by far one of the most knowledgeable ER doctors I know, he took to the time to explain what was going on and my options for treatment. He saved me from a great deal of pain. I was back to work after one two days of rest. Overall awesome, I will definitely be recommending this to family and friends! I really appreciate the help I was given.<//Review>< rating>

They had a record high number of patients tonight, but never made me feel rushed through the care process.  Normally I am in and out within an hour! Even with a higher number of patients (many were small children) they treated everyone with kindness and patience. The doctor is wonderful, caring and just an all around great doctor! The rest of the staff is equally as wonderful which is so rare to find in other urgent care facilities.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Went here 4x this past week. Chose this place because I thought I would need a scan and could walk across the breezeway. First time I went in was for blood in urine. Told them about an existing kidney stone on the right side. No scan just antibiotics and come back. Went back they said I was fine. With in 4 hours I was doubled over in pain in my left flank. Went in the next day gave a urine sample blood sample and antibiotic and come back tomorrow I have food posoining. No one else who had Thanksgiving at my house had food poisoning.  No scan. Final time I went in still in pain all my blood counts were fine given another antibiotic. Next day the left flank pain was so bad I finally went to ER with in an hour I had a scan and was admitted because the pain was so bad they had to get in under control. Tomorrow I am scheduled to have a very large stone removed that is causing a blockage in my left kidney Very nice very clean but wouldn’t go there for anything internal.</Text><rating>2</rating>< Time>

<Review>Friendly professional staff. Will definitely recommend to others. Great bed side manners. Made me feel comfortable, and as important as the next patient. Dr. Basi was on top of my condition, and had me in CT in less than 3hrs. Elite urgent care will be my go to place, if ever I need quick care in the future.< /Review><name>Joy Marcaida-meadows<//name></record>

<review>My 7 month old son had his elbow dislocated by his sister. We were frantic, my wife hysterical, and no one would see us as our insurance just lapsed.  I had $1000 cash in my pocket, credit cards, and went to 2 other  places, but they wouldn't see us. Elite fixed my boy within 20 minutes and charged us $145.  Fast, professional, caring, practical, don't go elsewhere.<//review>< pictures>

< Review>
This clinic was a great find on a Sunday afternoon.  I called before going over and actually spoke to Dr. Basi on the phone.  When we got there a very helpful security guard helped us get to the location.  The waiting room was very warm and the staff were friendly and knowledgeable.

I saw the doctor in less than an hour.  He has a down to earth bedside manner.  He explained what was wrong with me and what treatment I would need. He also gave me a sense of what to expect as I continued to heal. The medical facilities were also very clean and modern.

This is a place I would suggest to others and would go to again for urgent care services.<//Review>

Which is understandable. However, when the doctor finally came, she never even touched my kids. My daughter was extremely congested. I would have appreciated if she would have at least checked her chest. I basically had to tell her to prescribe medication or she wouldn't have. I was completely unsatisfied and felt it was a waste of our time and money. I was trying to avoid the ER. Next time I will go to the ER.< /text>< Resp>

Let me start by saying I’m a travel RN.   I’ve worked everywhere from the cardiothoracic ICU to endoscopy units.   I’ve seen a lot of places literally from coast to coast  and know the medical field.   I was completely blown away from the minute I walked into the building.   As others have said, it is absolutely immaculate.   So clean and well-kept with beautiful pictures on the walls.   I have never seen anything like this as far as an urgent care.   It’s more of a mini hospital/emergency department/surgical center.   I was on the verge of going to the ED at the hospital I work at because I knew I needed the entire toe nail removed.   Knowing about ED wait times and the chaos that can happen there, I really wanted to avoid it if possible.  However, I didn’t think an urgent care could do the minor procedure I knew I was going to need.   I just stumbled on Elite Urgent Care’s website with the help of my wife, who is also an ICU RN.   She said “whoa, this place says they do abcess removal and toe nail removals.”   One side of my toe was abscessed, as well.  Long story short: I decided to give Elite Urgent Care a shot.

The staff:  Everyone from the check-in process to my discharge treated me with courtesy and respect.  The nurses, PA (Jason Elliott), and PA student were all wonderful.   I know how to take care of patients, and it’s obvious they do as well.   They treat you how you should be treated and listen to you.

The treatment: Jason, the PA, knew exactly what needed to be done as soon as he assessed me.  He explained the options clearly,
risks, benefits, etc.   I had to have four nerve blocks in my foot and toe for the procedure.   Jason took his time and was very thorough, checking on me during it multiple times.   After the blocks had time to work, he performed the procedure.   His high level of skill was obvious.   He was also a great teacher to the PA student who was with him, explaining each step.   We did have an unexpected event occur.  In the medical field, you can find out how “good” somebody is when things don’t go perfectly according to plan   So, after the procedure, Jason couldn’t get the bleeding to stop because the infection involved so much of the nail bed and due to the abcess.   As soon as this occurred, Jason knew exactly what to do.   They ended up having to cauterize my toe to stop the bleeding.   Jason explained to me step by step what he was doing while also training the student.  This is not something they have to do often, but Jason did it like it’s a daily occurrence.   They assessed my pain at various times keeping it under control.  After the procedure,  they took their time with the dressing and really made it look good.

Discharge:  They did an excellent job going through my discharge instructions, wound care, dressing changes, follow up appmt, etc.   I do not act like a nurse when I am the patient.   Some of us nurses make the WORST patients, lol.   I can tell they do a great job explaining to me with no medical background how what they need to know for discharge.

Summary:  Overall, this was the best “urgent care” I have ever seen or been to.   It felt like a VIP hospital, haha.  I don’t even want to call it an urgent care.   I would give it 10 stars if I could.   I would recommend Elite Urgent Care for ANYONE who needs treatment.   I overheard them talking to patients on the phone and explaining different disease processes, providing advice on various topics, etc.   It’s obvious the staff is held to a high standard, and they live up to it and then some.   Being a travel nurse more than 2300 miles from home, it’s nice to know that if something unexpected happens to my family or me, there is a place like this I can go to other than just the hospital.  It’s a very comforting feeling.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

I looked on the website and they had my insurance listed. I just went in and the front desk attendant looked at my card and very rudely told me that they didnt take my insurance even though it was listed on the website. She told me that the website was under construction and essentially told me it was my problem for their information being wrong  avoid them if at all possible. Modesto Urgent Care on Mchenry and Floyd is a much better choice if you can go there.< /review>

For as busy as he was today he was pretty fast.

Super slow staff 3 hours and still waiting. Beware : The girl that did my blood pressure was rude. I told her the cuff was hurting my arm  badly and to remove it. She just looked at me with a crazy look on her face. Now I have a huge bruise accross my arm. Not happy! The blood draw guy was awesome fast and almost pain free. The Dr was very helpful and really listened to me. The place is really clean and modern.</review>

Follow up on remark! I dont know who you are, but I am telling you what my research told me! It is used for nausea before and after surgery, and very mild cases of runny nose, and if it wasnt dr bassi that I seen,  then why did HE order my prescription? That should have came from the dr I saw!, now, I have a throbbing headache, and diarrhea, and no relief from my coughing, cant sleep or anything, and it's been 3 days now. and do your research, I did!!!!!!!!!!end of follow up!I went there today with a  Sinus infection, and sore throat. I am a 63 year old woman on Medicare. When I first arrived I signed in, no one asked me if there was a change in my medication,  since i had not been there in about 6 months, and when they took me in the back to do my weight ect. Still no one asked about what meds Iam taking at this time. That is standard practice, and mandatory by state laws. I saw DR. Basi Amrik. She was unkind, and uncaring. Not a very nice person,  she prescribed  Antibiotics called amox/k, and never bothered to tell me it would cause a yeast infection, and a syrup called phenergan, which is  Typically used for nausea and upset stomach Before & After surgery. They sometimes use that for a very mild case of a runny nose, did me no good! $20 for this bottle, she didn't take my condition serious . She didnt take into consideration that I might not be able to afford the med. I took the medicine anyway, and about 10 hours later, I woke up with a throbbing head ache, I'm going to another doctor in the morning. Yeast infection and a throbbing head ache, dont know which is worse! The side effects from the medicine,  or the symptoms I went in with!<//Review>

{'time': 1551897940697, 'text': 'Hello Pam, very sorry to hear you did not find your visit at Elite Urgent Care adequate today. You are able to call our office and speak with the provider at any time regarding questions you may have about your treatment. If something is not working for you, we would be happy to try and accommodate. Dr. Amrik Basi is a male physician, so you may have been seen by someone else as you refer to your provider as a “she”. Amox/k is an antibiotic, it may take a few days to kick in and for you to start feeling a difference. Pheregen is a cough-cold pain relief medication, not used typically for nausea or a runny nose, though these can be helpful side effects of the medication.

Exceptional service, very clean modern facility with medical services either in house or on the premises.  Exceptional Doctor who takes the time to explain what your medical problem is and how he plans to treat it.</Text>

<review>At 6:30 pm I booked an appt. online for 7:20, pm, 40 minutes prior to closing as advertised online, brochure, building signage, only to arrive at 7:10pm and be turned away.

The nurse said "someone would've called you  today to let you know our last appt. is at 7".

I highly suggest they update their misleading hours of operation and have their website updated to give you 7pm as the only option time.  It's incredibly frustrating to drive there "not feeling well", only to be turned away.< /review>< Name>

<Response>{'time': 1551898745835, 'text': 'Toni, our apologizies you were turned away when you were not well. It is standard practice for Urgent Care facilities to take their last patient 1 hr before closing time. We take our last patient at 7PM on weekdays but remain open until 8PM for patient questions, pharmacy requests, etc. Our online appointment making software is new to us! We have made adjustments so you are unable to book after 7, hopefully this will avoid turn away situations and confusion. Have a great day!'}<//Response>< userid>

I took my daughter with Dr. Bassi on Sunday because she woke up that morning with a swollen eye. I was so glad they were open to avoid that long wait time at the emergency room. We were helped as soon as we got there. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful. The office was completely top notch, all the latest equipment, and super clean. They do just about everything there from lab work to x-rays if needed. My daughter is usually very terrified to go to the Doctors but he made her feel super comfortable. As soon as he took a look at her, he knew the swelling was caused by a mosquito bite near her eye. Antibiotics were needed so the staff called it in to our pharmacy to be ready once we got there. He even gave me a handout that explained what she had in greater detail. The service here was just excellent, way beyond my expectations. You have to come here and check it out for yourself. You wont be disappointed. Thanks Dr. Bassi!<//review>

If you have something wrong that is cute and dry.  This is the place to go.  If you have something not so easy, expect to be treated like a piece of poop by the doctor.  The staff is very nice and sweet though.</Review>

I have recommended Elite to all of my close friends and never once has anyone I know had a bad experience. I am really pleased that there is a constant standard of great healthcare kept up in this facility. Staff is kind, Dr. Basi is very respectable, and the nurse practitioners are also very smart!

B.T.W.- this urgent care was on the third floor of the black building on McHenry for a long time but now has moved to the first floor, same building! Just so you don't get confused! For being in the process of moving, they are still doing a great job!

The young girl at the front desk was very rude to patients and making no eye contact. I don't understand how they feel it's ok. Just very RUDE! Treating others as they were below her in some way. I'm sure she makes 12.50$ hour. She needs to settle it down. Relax your not the doctor girl. Your a helper,  be polite.</Text>

<review>This place is awesome. I called at 745 ish unknowing what time they closed . The Dr said that he would wait for me to drive there so I could be seen. Upon arriving he met me down stairs as the buildings automatic door close at 730pm to let me in. The office is really clean and once in the back the space looks like a full ER. I was out of there at 815!! I don't think I've been to a regular Dr visit in that amount of time.. If I need an emergency Dr visit im definitely returning here!!!</review>< resp>

Dr. Basi treated my 94-year-old mother with courtesy and respect, taking immediate action to diagnose her back pain. He was able to cut the three-week wait for an MRI to three days! He listened, was kind, and obviously cared about her. We were so happy to be able to get her in to Elite Urgent Care within a couple hours of making the call, whereas her regular primary physician had asked her to wait two days. We can't recommend Dr. Basi and Elite Urgent Care enough! An excellent place for urgent health care needs.< /text>

<Text>DR was great! Very clean an was seen pretty quickly. The only reason I gave 3 stars is because one of the staff (a young female) in the front was very rude! Wish I could remember her name. She had long dirty blonde hair. You defintly need to change that bad & rude attitude!< /Text>< pictures>

<Text>My husband found this place while doing research when he was in need of urgent care. He shared about his great experience with Dr. Basi and his staff with myself and family. So I decided to go to Elite myself when I needed urgent care and I was impressed with the no wait in and out excellent service. The staff is professional and friendly and I will continue to seek Dr. Basi's office for future urgent care needs for myself and chidren. I highly recommend Elite Urgent Care!

We've had our young son in 3 times, each time Dr. Basi spoke with him directly and treated us both with respect. I've been seen here twice and have been pleased with Dr. Basi's thoroughness and willingness to listen. The staff is pleasant and the office is clean and well cared for. Dr. Basi is our go-to urgent care doc!</text>

I had a serious eye infection which was misdiagnosed by my PCP. Days later, I was dreading an ER or urgent careI googled local urgent care facilities and was impressed by the Elite reviews, so I took a chance. Each and every staff person I encountered was very friendly. Intake was very brief and I waited for a half hour. Dr. Basi was thorough in his exam. Staff submitted a referral for a specialist and I had an appointment scheduled the next day. Within 3 days, Dr. Basi provided relief, rx, diagnosis, specialist treatment and follow-up. Each visit I waited no longer than an hour at most. This is truly a hidden gem.</Text>

2 1/2 hour wait for a total of maybe 10 minutes of medical attention by an extremely rude doctor. I recommend going to another urgent care.<//text>

<Review>The owner/doctor was very unkind and rude; also, the wait to see this abomination of an owner/doctor took approximately two hours. Lastly, I was yelled at and almost threatened to be thrown out by the owner for supposedly wasting his time with my sickness. This place deserves to have a 0/10 review.</Review>< GmapID>

<Text>My daughter was having ear pain that began at her afternoon soccer practice and was progressively getting worse.  I suspected an ear infection and knew if we didn't get antibiotics going she was going to have a tough night.  I found Elite Urgent Care through my insurance website and called to see how late they were open.  This was at 7:42.  They close at 8, but the doctor had already left and they stop taking patients at 7 pm.  However, Dr. Basi agreed to come back to the office to see us.  He turned around and came back to the office.  I hit every red light trying to get there quickly and arrived just before 8 pm.  The entire building was deserted.  Dr. Basi met us in the lobby of the building and took us into the office.  The lobby looked great.  You could tell it was a new facility.  Dr. Basi had to get the paperwork for us and had to take my daughter's vitals, as there was not staff left.  Sure enough, she had an ear infection.  I cannot thank Dr. Basi enough for coming back after he was headed home to see us.  What would have taken HOURS in the ER had us out in 30 minutes.  This is a doctor who CARES!  Dr. Basi also told me that they can do everything an ER can do.  They can have full lab capabilities and can have results in minutes.  I totally recommend this facility!</Text>< name>

Having many recent health issues and having to change my insurance, do to a job loss I have been one of those that has fallen through the health care system crack of not being able to keep any of my original Drs...
.On my quest to find a GOOD Dr. that takes my insurance has not been doable so far.
...However when I stumbled accross the Elite website I gave them a call to see if they took my insurance, they don't but the kind receptionist transfered me to the Dr......Dr. Bassi (hope I spelled it right)....And he asked me some health questions about myself. He said he really wanted to help me and would do whatever he could to figure out what is wrong with me. Stunned in amazement that for one, a Doctor actually took the time to talk to me on the phone and  had a sincere desire to want me to get better, restored my faith in the fact that someone was doing this to actually help people get better :) It's rare nowadays...I will be recommending Elite and Dr. Bassi to everyone I know that wants a Doctor that CARES :)<//text>

If I could post zero star I would that Dr.basi  treated me very rude like garbage,I get medicare at 24 years old he question why I'm on medicare that's not your concern when you got paid for the visit. I felt my patient rights was token I felt discrimination by staff and Dr I will never never never go back unless I want to be treated like a outcast!!!<//review>

<Review>The receptionists were friendly upon arrival but soon after being attended they made me wait in the exam room 45 minutes. I was told the results were going to be ready in 5 minutes and the blatant disregard for their patients is shocking to say the least. Suffering from a fever and constant chills the wait was close to unbearable. Not going back here ever again!!<//Review></record>
