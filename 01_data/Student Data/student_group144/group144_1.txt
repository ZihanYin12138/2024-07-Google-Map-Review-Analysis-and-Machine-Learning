Clear Choice San Diego has highly professional, caring staff who kept me well informed throughout the process. They responded quickly to my pre-op concerns and attentive to my post-op well-being. I am grateful for their compassionate expertise.<//text>

<user>107966028882727559907</user><Review>I went for my consultation in May of 2020. I decided to go ahead and invest in the smile I deserved. The staff was wonderful, answered all my questions and addressed my concerns.  It has been a lengthy process but well worth every minute and every dollar.  I am within 10 days of getting my permanents and I must say I would do it all over again.  Yes the cost is up there but I’m investing in me and I feel I’m worth it.<//Review><gmap_id>0x80dc07199fde42f5:0x51c91902c2fc38ca< /gmap_id></record>

My amazing Dr. is Dr. Ing and her wonderful assistant is Vanessa. These two absolutely wonderful women made me feel so comfortable from the very start. The professional and personable care I was given by these two women says alot about them. The care and respect I received, included: asking me what I wanted, my input was important to them, asking if I was ok or did I need anything. You can see and feel they genuinely care about you. II am beyond happy and 💥 WOWED. The five star rating should be  💯 +.
Thank you again.<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

The Drs and entire staff, Dental Assistants,  Administrative Staff, and Lab personnel, are amazing. My process took twice a long as planned due to COVID. The Drs and staff reassured me and listened to my concerns.
I truly love these people.  The outcome is worth the cost and process.  I look forward to seeing everyone again for my hygiene appointment in 6 months.
Love, love, love these people ❤<//Review>

I had no teeth on top, and only 8 teeth on the bottom. My lower teeth were completely broken and  Rotted. I am absolutely terrified of the dentist. My experience with clear choice was nothing less amazing!! They really do care about their patients,  and make you feel like family. Dr O and his team are hands down the best there is. My surgery was fantastic and I had very little pain afterwards,  matter of fact I was able to just treat the pain with  Ibuprofen. I just got my final set of teeth yesterday and I was in tears! Dr O gave me my smile back along with opening the door to a whole new world of food. I so recommend them to anyone who is suffering the embarrassing sight of missing teeth or like me having no teeth for almost 18 yrs. For a while I had full dentures, but still found myself unable to eat alot of foods, and often times  Choked while eating, so I just didn't wear them. Not to mention how uncomfortable they really were. My teeth feel like my real teeth. I can now eat whatever I want and have my self confidence and self esteem back! Thank you to the entire staff for helping on this adventure!<//review>

My husband got his final teeth today! This has been a wonderful experience. Very professional! My husband had a mouth full of 40 year old crowns. He was always afraid to go to the dentist. His mind was at ease the entire time. He has a beautiful smile and has been smiling more that ever before! Thank You Clear Choice San Diego.<//Review>

Recently had a procedure here, the staff were great . All of them were super friendly and very knowledgeable and the experience was very easy to get through with the team there . The surgeon is a true professional I had some serious work done , a bit more than the usual client and was overly impressed with the results. How ever I can’t say the same for the management,A few days after my surgery I had excessive uncontrollable bleeding and had to go to the emergency room and spent the entire night trying to hold off the bleeding and make it through the night  , I’m a wounded Afghanistan veteran of the United States marine corps . And have been through ,and seen first had substantial injuries of every kind and that night I feared for my life and when conveying the message to management they brushed it off. Then I got sick from all the blood in my stomach and tore all the stitches. When speaking with the manager many times dr oyama... he belittled the situation week after week and left me with a terrible infection I’m my mouth , all the bone and screws exposed under the implant and heavy duty antibiotics for 2 months ! I revived a brain injury overseas and don’t react well to open wounds I’m my skull . complicating an already terrible condition it’s been really hard to cope . Further after seeing another maxillofacial surgeon who saw first had the bone , implants , and bone exposed on both bottom sides of my mouth suggesting it needed attention right away. I went black to the center for the 8th time after my surgery and they lied to my face and told me that no bone is exposed and we’re not willing to re stitch the wounds closed and now after paying a very lager amount of money I have to spend another large amount to get it fixed elsewhere . Very poor after care and extreme unprofessionalism from the management. The team and surgeons are top quality but I definitely would not recommend anybody to them until they replace that manager.</Review>

GREAT experience, very, very professional staff and very welcoming.  The Doctors were GREAT.

My ONLY disappointment was the "New Teeth In One Day" slogan.....I think that is a bit misleading.  The entire process takes six to eight months or more, so I think that the advertising needs to be CLEAR....you get temporary teeth,  nothing near the strength or durability of the final product on day one.

Other than that, an EXCELLENT experience!!<//Text>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I went in today for my third Annual Evaluation, and as usual, the facilities were modern and immaculate, the equipment was state-of-the-art, and the staff was very polite, well-dressed, articulate, and very well qualified at every position.

It is very easy to feel as though they all have known you for a long time, though some are meeting you for the first time. It is a comfortable, but professional atmosphere that creates a warm, yet confident feeling in your mind that assures you that you are doing, or have done, the absolute right thing for yourself. You clearly went there with a dream of a much better appearance, more self-confidence, and overall happiness...and, there your dream came true at the hands of those who were committed to fulfill every aspect of that dream. I know this sounds like a commercial, but I assure you that it's not, and I am absolutely not being paid to say any of this. You may be assured that this is all true.</review></record></dataset><record>

When I  went in for my initial consultation I  was wary. As I thought about it and know my teeth were not going to get better just worse. I  was eating soft food only.
So I  decided to get my teeth done. I felt at ease with the complete staff. The procedure was explained so I had no fear of the procedure. They helped me get the financing I needed. So really all I had to do was show up the day of my procedure. The staff made the follow  up appointments at my convenience. NEVER DID I FEEL LIKE A PATIENT, I FELT LIKE FAMILY.
The sweetest group of people I have ever met.
Every time I  arrived I never had a wait.
I will refer any and all my friends to them.
HAPPY DANCE LOVE MY TEETH SO NATURAL LOOKING.< /text>

<review>I had a great experience with Clear Choice.  Although I had a setback with a failed implant initially, Dr. Khatami and his group worked patiently with me to do a new implant, and helped me to keep the temporary bridges until I finally got permanent ones that look and feel great.

I would particularly like to thank his assistants Sandy, Elizabeth, and Irma who were all exceptionally pleasant and skillful.   Everyone there treated me very well and I am very pleased with the work I had done.< /review>< Pics>

The other day I was exiting a doorway and collided with an elderly man coming in..  I said " Oh, excuse me" and he said "You have such a beautiful smile!"  That says it all!  I chose this process, not only for cosmetic reasons, but for my overall health and couldn't be more satisfied.  I had my yearly checkup and have suffered no bone loss in my jaw.

<user_id>104313045454262627347< /user_id><Response>None</Response><review>There are so many wonderful things to mention about making the Clear Choice decision for a full set of dental implants. Everyone appears to genuinely love working there and they all make you feel so special as you immediately become a part of their family. From Mike who we met at the first consultation, to Dr Khatami who was with me every step of the way, to Dr Thompson the oral surgeon, and each and every girl I met during my various visits, the staff is superior in every way. They were all with me on this great adventure and shared in the joy I felt. The eight months flew by quickly as I was always comfortable wearing my temporary bridges during the healing process. The biggest shock was I could not believe that I could love the permanent zirconia bridges any more than I already loved my temporary ones, but I do!!! My smile is so comfortable, bigger and brighter than I could have ever imagined. Clear Choice in Sorrento Valley has changed my life!</review><date>1562975859532<//date>< rate>

Today the 9th of july, I had a wonderful experience at clearchoice dental. The staff was as usual very friendly and upbeat. But Alex to me was extra special. First one could tell she truly knew what she was doing. She had a gentle way of taking care of things, but at the same time her hands were the touch of a lot of knowledge of her craft. Thank you Alex. Everything is great.</text>

Let me start off by saying I was terrified of dentists due to have had quite a few bad experiences with them. The staff out at Clear Choice Sorrento Valley are so welcoming and make you feel comfortable that make the procedure go without having fear. Dr.Amir K not only promised me but gave me a perfect smile. I couldn't be happier with the results</text>

Yesterday I had my All On 4 surgery.  The steps leading up to the procedure and the surgery itself far exceeded my expectations.  My new teeth are beautiful and I wish to thank the excellent doctors and support staff at Clear Choice San Diego for my new smile.

Update -- Received my final set of teeth today.  I'm a retired City of San Diego Equip Tec who specialized in repairing equipment of many different makes and sizes.  I consider my new teeth to be  very precisely made. They remind me of my younger days when I had a full set of teeth. Simply amazing!  Dr. Khatami and his staff were a pleasure to work with.

Update -- I was back at Clear Choice San Diego yesterday for a little follow-up. It is such a joy when dealing with the staff at Clear Choice S.D..  They had me in and out in a very short time and they are always so friendly and efficient.

I still remember back in the past when I dreaded going out to eat a nice dinner with my wife. I was missing so many teeth that I truly did not enjoy my food. My wife Liz has noticed a big change in the way that I now enjoy my meals. I'm very glad that I went to Clear Choice and from the first visit I knew they were the ones I wanted to perform my All-on-4 dental implants.

<rate>5<//rate><Review>Initially, I did not feel that it was a good thing to do.  That is, I was going to remove my remaining 10 "good" teeth.  In reality, they were not that good.  I had pain in most of them.  After thinking about it for about a couple of weeks, I decided to do the work in my upper teeth.  Immediately after the surgery, I felt the difference.  Not having to deal with the partial removable bridge that I had in the front which felt almost every bite I took, was the best thing that happened to me at that moment.  From that day on, my life changed.  I was able to eat, smile, and forget about the pain my other teeth gave me everyday.  I am happy I took such a decision.  The money spent was well worth it.  It was a wise decision.<//Review></record>

WOW!!!!  Where do I begin!!!  CLEAR CHOICE has changed my life forever!!!!  I had forgotten how to smile. . . .When I decided I was going to talk to someone about the implants, I checked both places.  I felt like with the other place, you were just a number to them, at Clear Choice, it is like you have become part of their Family. . .It was the best thing I ever did for myself. . .my ONLY regret is waiting so long. . . .I can't even begin to tell you how much I have advanced in my career this past several months!!!!!  It is amazing what a SMILE says!!!!  DON'T WAIT ANY LONGER!!!!!   You owe it to yourself!!!!<//Text>

Have been going to Clear Choice since July 2016, that was when I had all my teeth removed and went home with temporary teeth. Today is February 28 2018 and I have those same teeth minus the molars still in my mouth. I AM VERY UPSET THAT THIS FACILITY CAN NOT GET IT RIGHT! From not being the correct length to the upper and lower teeth not matching in color it has been very hard because the doctor decided to cut the rear teeth off my temps so he would have to keep repairing them while I waited for the permanent set. Now that make one chew like a gopher because only the canines make contact. My face has sunk in because there are not enough teeth to keep my face from sinking in. Now I broke one of the front teeth so I only have two teeth I can chew with. I am sooooo depressed</Text>

My mom is 69 and unfortunately has neglected her teeth for most of her life. As a young girl she had a horrible experience at a dentist office and developed a fear of dentists. The combination of this fear and of course putting her children's care over her own lead to the deterioration of her teeth. I knew her teeth were bad but it wasn't until she lost one of her front teeth and we made a trip to the dentist that I really understood the severity of her situation.

We went to a "traditional" dentist and walked away with close to a years worth of appointments. I knew right then that this process would never work. I could possibly get my mom to the first and maybe even the second appointment but after that it would be a struggle.

That is when my family found Clear Choice. My brother and I went to a seminar to learn more about this company, the procedure and if in fact it was true that someone could walk away with a new set of teeth . Well, it was TRUE.

I cannot express in this review what Clear Choice has done for my mom. When she first visited Clear Choice she weighed all of 95lbs, if that. We realized that without most of her teeth and the poor condition her remaining teeth were in she was not able to eat solid foods and was not getting proper nutrition. To imagine my mom not being able to bite into a apple or eat a steak or even something as easy as bite into a sandwich was heartbreaking. Clear Choice was not just a clear choice for my mom, it was the ONLY choice!

The entire staff at Clear Choice, San Diego is amazing! From the greeters at the front desk, Ryan Peterson who has been with us from day one and goes out of his way to check on my moms progress each visit to the outstanding doctors who performed my moms miracle. Scott Perkins, DDS and Arshiya Sharafi, DDS, PC we so caring and gentle with my mom. We would not be where we are today without the care of this team!

My mom is now complaining that her clothes do not fit, we have gone up a few sizes and can't seem to fill her appetite. Dream Come True! Clear Choice gave my mom her smile back but more importantly gave my mom her life back and you cannot put a price tag on that! Thank you Clear Choice!</review>

I have not tried other places to compare, but I chose A-1 because it felt more secure and protected after reading reviews on other places. There is a secure, gated fence, and security alerts (supposedly) if someone access your unit w/o entering the code. It's not a 24 hr watch, but it is better than nothing.

I preferred a drive in unit for ease of moving in and out, but none were available. These are probably hot commodities. My unit was on the 3rd floor. However, they do provide flat-bed carts to help move (and these helped out tremendously. Their elevator is also humongous to fit big items. All in all, it was not as much of a burden as I thought.

Having read previous reviews, I understood when they raise their rent so I was not surprised when it happened. It is something that they do not advertise, but will answer if you inquire about it.

Throughout all my visits, the staff has been courteous whenever I needed to interact with them. I'd recommend this place for anyone considering a storage unit.< /review>

< Review>
I reserved a space online and immediately viewed it later that day. Daniel was so kind! He showed me two units that were similar, one climate-controlled and on the 1st floor and one that was not climate-controlled and on the 2nd floor. He explained the benefits of both and didn't rush through anything.

This was a huge difference than my pretty subpar experience at Public Storage. Needless to say, I ended up booking the unit on the spot with Daniel. He walked me through all the paperwork and details, and I walked away with my lock on my unit and ready to go.

When my movers came with my belongings days later, it went smoothly. There are parking spots near all the doors to the units, and they have carts ready to use.</Review>

Corey was very nice and had a fun bubbly personality. He helped me tour a unit and then reserved it very quickly and seemlessly for me and was able to easily answer all my questions. I could tell he has a genuine smile on his face through his mask.

I will definitely recommend the place to my friends.<//review>

A-1 in Oakland has been great for us. It's conveniently located, clean, easy to access, and the service has been fantastic. I've now rented a unit from them twice, and both times I've dealt with Dena, who's been delightful. She helped me get the same storage unit I'd used previously and even was able to honor the previous rate we paid (I'd only been out of it for a week). Great people and easy storage option. If I'd known it was this easy to get storage in the area, I'd probably have done it a while ago.</text>

<review>I was helped right when the store was about to close and the level of professionalism and level customer service I received was impeccable even though they were about to close in 15 to 20 minutes.

I was in need of using the storage unit that night and A-1 Self Storage help make that happen. Now I am able to get all of my items I need in storage without having to worry about getting a unit for moving this weekend.

Thank you very much for your help. It is much appreciated!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1580144966736, 'text': "Welcome to A-1 Self Storage, Stephen! We value your business & appreciate that you've taken the time to share your storage experience!"}<//Resp>< gmap_id>

First of all, you can't beat the online pricing.  I did some comparison pricing bur seems to me, their pricing is overall very reasonable.  I like how you can book online and then work directly with the local office.

The staff is friendly, willing to work with you and professional.

I really appreciate how clean and tidy the facilities are.  This includes each individual unit, as well as the public areas of the entire facility..  The security there is also streamline and reassuring.

Thank you.</Text>

The parrot rescue I volunteer with has been using this facility for over 5 years and our experience has been excellent!

J.P. and everyone who works there have always been courteous and efficient.

I definitely recommend A-1 Storage.

Thank you for all your good work!

I was looking for a small unit for the little bit of things i have amd A1 was able to assist me above and beyond my expectation. When I was running out of time to move my things Corey helped me (he didnt have to do it) however he provided outstanding customer service by doing so. I wish my bank 1st norcal credit union had people like him!!!! Corey is the B-O-M-B!!!

A-1 is the only storage facility we use. We keep coming back because of the friendly staff that both Maribel and Marisol show us. The facility is spotless, secure, and easy to access our storage with ease. They're extended hours allow us flexibility when comparing to other storage facilities. I have recommended family and friends and will return for our storage needs in the future. I would recommend A-1 if cost, safety, and peace of mind are important to you.</Text>

Excellent, detailed service on the phone when I called in to ask about what was available. Codey spelled out very carefully what size units were available, and on what floors.

This was the best one.<//review>

A-1 Self Storage was great!  Friendly, helpful staff, spotless and well-organized facility with good security, and no difficulty in ending the lease when I was ready.  Also, they were very good about payment options and reminders.  I have no regrets choosing them for our storage facility when we needed one.< /Text>

I stored my belongings here for over a year and had a great experience!  It was very clean, safe and convenient off/on highway access.  I would rent here in a heartbeat if the need arose in the future.</review>

They helped me out with available discounts and set me up with 2 perfect units.
Would recommend them highly over Extra Space who are bandits! they send you a letter 3 days after you move in saying they are raising your rent next month!
Great location, access and very clean facility.

This A 1 storage is the best and had the best prices as well. The whole entire staff is so nice and they help each and everyone. They have great units to store stuff and all i can say is if you really need a storage place give them a call or go down and talk to them they will show you some units and alsp go over pricing</text>

<rating>1< /rating><Time>1516059284829<//Time><Review>This place will get you for every penny they can. Your bill escalates so read the fine print.

When it was time to cancel, they told me they don't do refunds, even though my auto payment had just come out. Girl at the front desk said they require a 10 day cancellation notice. I told her I would like to do that, and get a refund for the remainder of the month, but she said they don't do refunds.

When I asked why the 10 day cancellation policy if no refunds, she refused to answer.

She gave me Allen McCarthy's phone number and he never returned my call.

Basically, they stole 20 days rent from me, and they do this to customers all the time.

The Bridge Storage is right down the street. I have used them with my parents before, and they are a MUCH better option than this place.

<text>My experiences have been nothing but positive while dealing with Maribel and Anna. Whether over the phone or at the facility, they are professional, courteous and on point with their service delivery. Where one leaves off (out of the office), the other picks up, without skipping a beat; from initial (no charge) on hold/reservation to finalization/contract signing, everything went smoothly.

Their facilities are clean, secure and each unit is alarmed. This facility, which has entrance and exit gates at opposite sides of the property can accommodate large moving trucks. This is an important question to ask as not all storage facilities can handle oversize trucks.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Marisol was an expert! She came out to view the contents of my truck to confirm the size storage unit I had ordered was sufficient. She was warm and welcoming after an excruciatingly long day of packing and moving! A1 is a smooth running operation--efficient, clean and well organized!</text>

This has been my third time renting from this facility and I've always received exceptional service. The facility is so convenient for me since I just live across the water, it's always clean, it's affordable (I researched other facilities in the area) and sits beautifully next to the water which makes the experience even better. I would highly recommend this place.<//Review>

< review>
I have quite a few grievances with this storage facility but I'll begin with my a safety concern I had after seeing a car permanently parked inside the storage unit. I asked if overnight parking was allowed inside the premises and the front desk got confrontational with me and said they are well aware of the parked car. They said that in fact they have a family living in the storage unit. I am not well versed on zoning or permit laws for storage units but I did say that information is best to be shared with future renters of STORAGE SPACES.

Today at around 1:30 I went back to my storage unit and then inside the office to use the "Customer Business Center" they have. In fact I was told by a different front desk that this is not an actual customer business center and referred me to "the starbucks down the street" as I asked her for more direction to get to the starbucks she got defensive and told me to google it. She then proceeded to tell me that "she heard I was asking about the people who live in the unit" and that it was her living in the unit.

Like I said I dont know much about apartment permits and laws but this attitude of hers was completely unprofessional. She even had the nerve to tell me to go back to Los Angeles as if this was her house I was intruding in.<//review>

I started my search for storage by using online reviews.  With a little leverage on locations, I soon found my attention drawn to A-1 Storage High Street.  I asked for a space quote online, and found it reasonable.  I went into the location the next day with a packed van, and 10 minutes later was moving in my stuff, with size and price exactly as indicated.  The team is always super pleasant, the space remarkably clean, and the access entirely satisfactory.  I've even walked from Fruitvale BART from time to time and found it accessible.  The fun music had me dancing on occasion, and I'm hoping the security cameras didn't catch that part :-)

Moving out, when the time came, was also as simple and transparent as could be hoped-for.  I will definitely be doing business with these fine folks again--I just wish they'd go national.</Review>

BEWARE IF YOU ARE SOLW MOVING OR DISABLED. ~ I really liked this facility unfortunately after renting 2 units and moving all buy belongings inside I received a message telling me I had 15 days to GET OUT because I took too long moving in and was on the grounds 11 minutes after closing.< /Text>

This is my first time renting a storage unit from A1. The staff (Maribella) was super nice,  professional, and helpful. The unit that we rented was very clean and facility is about 9 miles to Berkeley Campus.
The price was also very reasonable.<//Review>

<Text>I have been a customer at this storage facility for years unfortunately, and I recently had a terrible experience with them. They increased my rent on a unit that was $362, for a 20 x 10 ( not cheap to begin with ! )  to $385. without writing me and giving me any notification of this, and even when I paid over the phone with the head Manager she did not bother to mention to me that my rent was increased by $23. /month.

REALLY NOT COOL   and they have made plenty of money off me and I have only been late with a payment maybe twice in 5 yrs.</Text>< user_name>

I tried reviewing for both yelp & google same day but got busy... anyways heres my review....
When I came looking for storage , I saw this place close to alameda bridge and I thought this place was very nice and huge. On the tour of the property with one of the friendly associates , I was informed of the security standards they have , accommodating hours (6am - 10pm access hours) , available push carts & a kiosk to make payments anytime ! The service & facility won me over and I came to rent the next week . The process was fast , easy and all rules & regulations were very informative . I plan on staying here a long time ; its a great place to store my personal belongings ! Thumbs up :)< /text>

< Review>
i came in on a sunday afternoon after driving from Los Angeles to Oakland, and the front desk girl was really helpful. She showed us where the unit was and helped me grab some of the moving dollies. She even showed me where the closest Uhaul was.

It was really nice to get that type of service after a very long day of driving.</Review>

<Review>I placed an online order for a handful of Promar TR-502 traps for turtle research and received the traps in a timely manner, along with a handwritten note from the owner, Geoff, saying he forwarded our website to his reptile-crazy friend. It was a great reminder about why I prefer to buy from small businesses instead of big corporations. Plus the particular trap in question wasn't available from any other online retailers. Next time I'm in the market for traps, nets, or other sampling equipment I'll check with LP Fishing Supply first.<//Review><Name>Kiley Briggs< /Name>< response>

Great place the owner is usually there very accommodating and friendly learned a lot from Kristin explaining various reels and features. They even have some free classes for beginners as well as experienced anglers. Will definitely be returning for all future outfitting and possibly some classes.< /text>

Great local tackle shop. They strive to carry and support gear from local manufacturers. The friendly and knowledgeable staff can help you with everything from catching "bugs" (lobster) to any fish.< /Review>

Love this place even though it was my first time there. They dont have much stuff there but their very friendly and I love the way they give us some hints about fishing on what baits and at what place. Anyone that are going to the pier or the habor I recommended this place for anyone on the go to get quick stuff. 😁<//Review>

<Review>I love this tackle shop. It is not like any other place I have been to. They have specialty items and build commercial traps as well. The owners are so amazing and it makes my family and my experience amazing. Even if I don’t need tackle or sportfishing supplies for the day, then it’s nice to just stop by and have a fishing storie telling session. We LOVE LP<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Seafood here - very tasty. Service is always nice even when they have a full house. The service was very welcoming and observant. The prices are fair for the quality of food. Food is like a restaurant in Louisville I loved.</text>

<rate>4<//rate><Text>It is absolutely delicious! Scallop and crab risotto is amazing! The feeling of chewing the large scallop is great, and the taste of tomato perfectly neutralize the cheese. Also blue cheese garlic bread is great (but too much for single. Maybe I should've asked for a half plate)! But definitely expensive. The disadvantage.< /Text>< Pics>

I mean it’s good and in a great location and I ordered to go and didn’t think I needed to tip since I was leaving. Whew Chile when I tell you she came out earlier than 15 minutes with my 3 fried tacos, which seriously made me doubt it’s freshness, however? She opened the door To the restaurant and I was parked right in front of her maybe like four steps, but she held the door open and waiting for me to get up and out of the car as I was just eating ice cream here waiting for my meal, I just felt like the customer service was trash, indoor dining is allowed now and it just seems like the attitude is on 1000 in here. Like I said, it’s always Latinas who be treating me the worst, I am a Latina too. Why they gotta be like this? Petty Af Three fish tacos for $10, girl bye #touristprices The fish seemed reheated and the tortilla was raw, literally I couldn’t eat it, it’s almost like they microwaved it, the taste was commercial. One star, two couples walked in, after I got my meal two minutes later they walked out, with their waters, something going on inside Customer service must be terrible<//review>

<Text>The chowder lives up to its name. The crab cakes are probably the best crab cakes I have ever had. Really flavorful. The mixed grill and the cioppino were well executed. You get a lot of seafood for the price. Service is good even when they are busy.<//Text>< pics>

It's difficult to see the low ratings and comments from some raters. My meal was fantastic! The salmon with fennel and potatoes dish was seasoned and grilled perfectly. If I could give 4.5 stars, the slightly lower score would be due to the wait staff, somewhat slow to respond. She was friendly and she asked if I was enjoying my meal. I definitely was.< /text>

the lady on the phone taking my order had absolutely horrible customer service. I work in customer service myself and am a manager so i know what should and shouldn't be said. She refused to give me lime for the amount of food i bought! I got food for 3 people and barely received enough lime for one. She said she's got to save it for other customers. However the lime for me is very vital for enjoying my boil bag. Also when i tried to order a drink she legit didn't want to sell it to me! She said it's too expensive! Like what?! Its MY order. I couldn't even enjoy my food nor a drink to go with it. Honestly if i wasn't as starving as i was i would have canceled my order. She also made me give her my card number over the phone even though im paying with cash? She said if i dont pick it up shes going to charge my card! Crazy.<//text>

We wanted to try this restaurant out since a while ago, unfortunately the last time we tried to get it it was full and couldn’t take any more people without reservation. Now we know why! The food was delicious and the service was incredible!<//review>

Me and my girlfriend at the time was in Hollywood on vacation almost a year ago and we couldn't find parking at Roscoe's chicken and waffles down the street. So we settled for seafood, it was a great choice. If you're in L.A. and looking for good seafood check this place out.< /Review>

My fav place in CA: Great food, great views, great service, things you do before and after dinner- visit the seals -  and......parking!

Try the crab and shrimp Louis.   The best intersection of healthy and happy!<//Review>

These crabs are okay, depending on type of sauce you get. We spend over 250.00 didnt even give 2 liter soda for free. Not sure if I will visit again..</review>

Anyways we ordered our food it took about 10 minutes which isn't to long. And it was so delicious.  Everything had flavor and we all loved it.

The Kickin' Crab is a seafood restaurant with locations scattered around California. This location has a good sized dining area full of bright colors with long tables which makes it ideal for groups. Seafood can be expensive and crab is usually very expensive. Considering that, the prices here are not unreasonable but they are not what I would consider inexpensive. They offer a large variety of crab dishes including large crab buckets that can cost anywhere from $50 to over $70 (depends on market price for crab). Crab isn't all they do though. I have had their seafood fettuccine which comes with shrimp, clams and muscles (still in the shell) with a mildly spiced Cajun cream sauce. It was delicious and I highly recommend it. For a small chain restaurant that happens to be tucked into a corner of a strip mall, this place really impresses. Be prepared to spend more money than you normally would at a restaurant tucked into a strip mall but if you like seafood, it will be worth it.<//review>

<Review>This place is a gem .. food is good, average price there is hardly no wait and service is great. Waitress are friendly and on top of things. Been there twice now for lunch. I think there should be lunch specials bqecause lunch can cost you up to $20. I think that too much. But overall food good and the shrimp is never dry or overcooked.<//Review><Rating>4<//Rating></record>

I am obsessed with this Kickin Crab chain, and this new location is my favorite one.
This was the most amazing and fun seafood experience!  The whole family had a great time and enjoyed an amazingly fun and messy dinner experience.  In addition, the food was DELICIOUS!!  We will definitely be back and share the experience with friends and family as they come into town to visit us!!!!

Overall, the service is excellent​, and the food delicious. Definitely, 5 Stars.<//text>

Quaint seafood house with throwback to the south. The seafood is prepared fresh as you order with choices of savory sauces. The service is attentive. You will not be let down. Give it a whirl...we’ll be back!<//Review>

The food hear is Authentic & Taste Great. I placed an order here via telephone and my ordered was ready on time. They Called and did follow up called to see if i was still on my way i liked the cashier she provided exceptional service. When arrived at the restaurant for my carryout order the place was deserted at 4pm on a Friday which was surprising but i liked it definitely doing that again. They restaurant was spotless they accept Samsung pay i tried Android pay didn't work. So their NFC Friendly and i suppose their probably delivery Friendly as well. (Postmates, Door Dash etc) P.s it's behind the Denny's. Honestly my Only complaint make it bigger..< /review>

<text>Went with family, they got fish tacos and the garlic butter trout dinner, I got fried shrimp and fries. The trout was pretty good and my grandpa enjoyed the rice pilaf although I didn't try it. The fish also came with steamed broccoli and the waitress said it would have garlic butter as well but was just plain steamed broccoli. Probably just a miscommunication.

The biggest flaw was the fish tacos, they were pretty meager with pieces of fish no bigger than your thumb, and more salsa than fish. For the price and considering it was probably more if an appetizer the shrimp wasn't too offensive but a bit disappointing. Tasted ok just a bit overcooked but they have good shoestring fries and free sauces to go along with it.

Normally at a place like this we'd get the seafood boil and it looked quite good, but didn't have time to go for the full mess. The place was clean and the service was friendly but you can tell they are still in the growing pains of opening. Giving it a 3 star now but I fully expect it to get better over time.< /text>< pictures>

So there are a few of these sweet chain spots around town but this one right here knows true perfection. I've tried over 30 cajun inspired restaurants and this one restaurant has me coming back all the time. The staff is friendly and the food is heaven. I'll try everything on the menu and it amazes me how unique the taste is but also how incredibly delicious it is too. Their clam chowder is too die for and the cajun spice is always spot on. All I'm saying is you won't leave The Kickin' Crab unsatisfied or craving another cajun restaurant ever again. This place becomes the husband and all the others remain flings. It's sooooo worth the visit!</Text>

<review>went to this place yesterday for the first time and the people were nice. I got a design done and I did enjoy it but the reason why I didn't like this place is because the nail shape that I usually get didn't come out how I personally like it also it hurt really bad when the lady was doing my nails and this never really happens at my other nail shop also if you're gonna get oval / almond shaped nails don't come to this place because they do them so weird especially the thumb (I'll insert a picture) but other than that the people were nice it was okay I guess 4/10</review>< Pics>

I had a great experience. I went on 8/16/19. I would  recommend this place I got my pedicure done with nina and it was the best! she literally put me to sleep. The foot massage was wonderful. I got a full set with gel done with sonny and they came out beautiful. I also got my eyebrows and mustache waxed with Tee and she did a great job. My eyebrows are pretty awkward because one is lighter than the other ans I also have a scar on my left eyebrow so they never look even, but somehow she made them look exactly the same. I  will definitely come back and next time I will be posting pictures.<//review>

This is the closes nail shop to my home so I’d thought I’d give them a try!
When I came in they rushed through my nails and not even having them on 1-2 days they’re falling off so I come back to get a fill for 3 nails. Mind you no one is waiting at this time and another customer walks in and because she’s getting a full set she’s going ahead of me. And I was there first, they asked me to stay an wait longer. No I won’t ever be back thanks for the bad services and nail job ✌️<//text>< Rating>

<Review>Never going back again. They do not care about your nails at all! I went in and the guy wanted to get them over with and did my nails in 15 minutes. He didn't even take his time to leave them nice, they were filed crooked, they weren't painted good on the sides or tips and weren't at all how i asked for them. I got gel nails which came out to $30 and the nail polish literally came off after 2 days, and after 5 days my nail fell off from my index finger. Literally not worth the money, they're nice but def not worth the price, sorry.</Review>< Pics>

The worst thing of all!! My nails were lifting after one day!!! Never go here to waist your money. I kept going here because the distance but not worth having to buy my own glue anymore</review>

Showed them a picture for reference and didn't look anything like the picture. When I asked to add a little more color the nail lady told me no! It would look to fake. So I ended​ up walking out with see threw nails, looking pretty fake to me. I wish she would of listen and added the color how I asked. Overall an unsatisfied customer and never going back!<//review>

Been coming here for a couple years now they're pretty good Kathy she does eyelashes and eyebrows she's excellent the price is a little high but it's worth it and there's a older man there he's really really good at  gel nails and T  she's awesome and really good with pedicures and Maria she's pretty good with doing long dramatic nails.< /Text>

VERY BAD service!! I was waiting for almost 10 min, they were completely ignoring me. They told me an hour wait, when I picked my nail color they told me it would be 2 hours! When I went into my car I saw a man come outside and dump dead skin and pieces of nails into a bush<//Review>

We have been living in the Avana Almaden community for just under a year now. It is a quiet, family-oriented community maintained my the most friendly and hardworking staff. From the front office to maintenance =, these guys are always willing to help. In particular, Isaiah, has been such a pleasant addition to the staff. He's incredibly true-hearted, honest, hardworking, and always on the move! If that guy is around, all is good.</text>

<text>I enjoy the friendly safe environment. I appreciate that when I put in a work order it’s usually handled with urgency. It makes me feel that the staff and employees here really care about me. It’s nice when i share my concerns they’re willing to go above and beyond to help ease my worries and address my concerns. Notifications come through on emails. They don’t flood you, and when work may be done near by they give you early notification & alert you to noise, or chemical that may be present.  Avana really cares about your well being.

I remember when I was first moving in I’d been sent quotes/rates on monthly cost for the unit i desired.  I spoke with a team member on a recorded line who had gave me a price and a date. When I arrived prices had gone up. I was shocked but The team member helping me searched the calls and heard that conversation. They honored that quote. I’d recommend living here because I like it. Even more avana sticks to its polices in order to ensure a clean and safe environment. They have serval ways to contact them, in person/online/ apps, etc. I’ve never had a package go missing and they’ve got a secure and easy ways to pick packages up. Everything just feels easy, and comfortable. That’s exactly what I hope to come home too after a long day at work.< /text>< response>

Nate has been SUCH a huge help in answering any and all of my questions. He’s very thoughtful, always remembers us at the pool! He even gave us some great dog tips (as we’re new doggie owners) and helped us through the entire process of adding the dog to our lease!</review>

My partner & I moved here from Sunnyvale. I grew up around Branham & am familiar with the Almaden area. My favorite thing is how close SO many different plazas are! I was hired nearby & love how close I am. I get to skip a lot of traffic. Lovely aesthetic & cleanliness to the apartments. I love the whole thing.</Text>

<Review>When we made to decision to start looking for a new apartment we started by making a list of important amenities and features that were necessary for our family. At the top of the list was dog friendly, location, spacious rooms, washer and washer, dishwasher, and pool.

After driving around the neighborhoods we wanted to stay in and hours of research online, we decided to take a couple of tours. Avana Almaden was at the top of our list for many reasons. After physically touring the community and meeting with Nathaniel several times (he answered all of our questions and was so friendly) we decided it was the right place for us.

We had some reservations. The community is quite large and we wondered about the noise level. We had some concerns about parking availability (the street parking always looked so full). And we noticed that there are more than a couple homeless camps nearby and we were a little hesitant to move our family so close to them (for many reasons- including that we have kids that walk to and from school, normally).

To our surprise, the community is very quiet and peaceful and thus far we have not had a single issue with finding parking- even when we have late evening commitments. As far as the homeless community, we have yet to even see them around the complex. Our sons have ventured out to walk and bike ride with no problems (they are 13 and 15 years old).

I’ve been living at Avana for nearly 2 years now and my family and I absolutely love it. The front office is always attentive. One of the great things about living here is the maintenance! Eric, in particular has been such a great assistance! When anything needs attention, he’s on it and makes it his priority to make sure things are good for the tenants. Awesome guy, and glad he’s part of this community!<//review>

<text>I have only been here a month but I really love the community. Neighbors are friendly, enjoy seeing all the different dogs and seeing our neighbor walk her cat on a leash. I want to give a huge thank you to Nathaniel in the leasing office. Without all his assistance and answering all my questions rapidly I wouldn't be living here. Nathaniel's customer service skills were beyond approach. Again thank you Nathaniel. If you ever have any questions or concerns Nathaniel is who you want to speak with.</text><date>1608189610132</date>< Response>

The Avana Almaden Apartments are beautiful. It's a surprisingly quiet community that suffers from high rent cost and low-ish end security. But that's the bay area really. I have come to love my apartment. Although I dont like that six month leases are cheaper. That's just asinine. But look at my view. I dont have any complaints about that.</Review>

I have only been here for a tour of the apartments so far but it was a great experience.  Do you know the feeling of apartment hunting when you have to force conversation with the people in the office when you just want to see the place, get your info, and leave?  I didn't have that feeling once with Nathaniel.  He is a genuinely helpful and easy to talk to individual. Even if I don't end up renting here I highly suggest checking this place out. Aside from the beautiful apartment and grounds they have amazing people like Nathaniel who can help guide you in the right direction!</Review>

Avana Almaden Apartments truly has the best five star customer service and the most well maintained property that I have ever experienced!!!  The resident office staff has consistently gone above and beyond far exceeding my expectations.  Most recently, I was out of the area and a large heavy delivery of 3 pieces arrived earlier than anticipated.  The staff offered to kindly place it in my unit - WOW!!!  Within minutes of the delivery, they confirmed safely placing the items in my unit.  Truly exceptional service!   Also, a few weeks ago I had a maintenance emergency at 9:00 PM on a Saturday night.  Within 15 minutes, my issue was resolved.  There is also an Amazon Hub on property ensuring that my packages are always safe.  The staff is always willing to help with a friendly personality!  I highly recommend this complex!<//Text>

<review>I was really nervous about having maintenance come into my unit with current shelter in place orders. I had put off a lot of fixes I needed until my dishwasher broke and felt I needed to finally call. Kyle and Eric were the two gentleman who came to fix what was damaged. They were so kind, wore their masks and followed proper protocol. Not to mention, my dog was yapping and being super disruptive, but they took the extra effort to kneel on the floor with her and calm her down. I can’t believe how quick they fixed everything! I had a huge list and it wasn’t even 15 minutes! When they left, I couldn’t believe everything was done, so I decided to double check myself and everything is perfect! I’m so glad I finally called and it went way better than anticipated. Thank you Kyle and Eric!!!< /review>< Pics>

I needed my ceiling fan fixed as well as my dishwasher replaced around the same time. Kyle with the maintenance crew came and assisted with the fan replacement and dishwasher replacement was AWESOME. He took the time to explain what was wrong with each item and what I could expect in regards to time frame of repair, delays that were expected due to COVID, and what the installation process would entail. On day of installation for both the Fan and the dishwasher, again Kyle was outstanding. He took the time to walk me through what would happen before the old unit was removed, and once the new unit was installed, he stayed around to ensure it worked to my satisfaction.<//text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1604961286323, 'text': 'Jared, thank you for sharing your positive experience!

Good place to live. Plenty of parking and the maintenance staff are always punctual and get the issues fixed the first time! Only down side are the neighboring homeless camp sites which leads to drug addicts loitering in the vicinity and prowling in the parking lot during night time hours.< /review>

The Staff are good, the maintenance are perfect but some neighbors are horrible and office don't do anything about their habits of smoking Weed inside appartment. Imagine it is already 100 degree and you walk in to your apartment with strong smell of puts all coming from downstair neighbor. I already complained several times but the issue just got fixed temporary. I know some people they smoke outside just to full fill their needs and respect their neighbors. At this point I m thinking to relocate since the management can't put firm action on this issue.< /text>

< Review>
We had multiple issues with the initial unit when we first moved in - pests, water damage to the bottom of the bathroom sink, then the kitchen sink backed up and overflowed. After reflecting our concerns the management promptly moved us to a different unit and our experience since then has been wonderful.
Juan is one of the managers and he has been very professional, helpful, and sincere the entire time. The maintenance supervisor, Mike, and his crew (Eric and Yemer) have also been extremely helpful during our move. Fast response time, friendly, and professional. They seem to really care about our experience at this apartment complex and want us to feel like home.
Our unit has vinyl floor, new countertops, good lighting, good neighbors. Lots of trees and areas for me to walk my dogs. Other than the small dog park I barely see any dog poop on the ground; overall very clean and nice property. Super convenient location - close to freeway and shopping center.
I would recommend this property to other people.<//Review>

This has been our 1st experience living in an apartment. Avana Almaden is such a nice and cozy community. When I first came to look at an apartment here I felt like I would be staying in "a home away from home" which is technically true. We will be leaving California in a couple of years and this place suits us for that allotted time. The office staff has been amazing to work with. Michael in the front office is the go to person. He is very friendly and willing to help with anything. He has always made sure we were taken care of and that we had the best. Rebecca is also a great person to work with. I haven't worked with her much but she was very willing to help when needed. The amenities are very nice and well kept. The community grounds are kept up with regularly. For my family the Avana Almaden Apartments have been a great place to live.< /text>

<text>The apartments are nice and newly remodeled. Great area, safe, quiet and in good walking distance from malls and restaurants. Overall I enjoyed and loved this residence until I moved out when my Job relocated me and the management staff tried to overcharge me me for the last month without explanation. I would recommend but they will try to get over on people when you move out.<//text>< pics>

Absolutely have loved living here. The price is reasonable and they definitely make you feel like an appreciated tenant at every chance. They have little tenant parties or treats in the office. It's the little details. We moved in when the pool area was being remodeled, but it was worth the wait. I especially love the office staff and maintenance. They are always prompt and helpful anytime you need something. This was my first apartment in San Jose and I absolutely have loved it. No better place to live!</text>

< review>
Unbearably loud and the management does not care at all about how loud your neighbor is. Add this on top of the fact the buildings are wooden frame and completely not sound proof and you will have signed yourself into hell. They also did construction above me unannounced for a month. The only nice thing is location but you can probably find better for how expensive these places are. You can completely hear all of your neighbors through the walls and ceilings. It’s terrible. Maybe when they renovate they should try sound proofing.<//review>

We've had some initial issues with habitability moving into the first apartment.  Issues that included a roach infestation, mold problems, and collapsing plumbing in the first two weeks.

Management transitioned our lease to a secondary apartment and were apologetic about the deficiencies. They've said that this is only the second time that this has ever happened.  I'll continue to update the review pending the quality of the next apartment.</review>

When we first moved in, it was a little bit out of our price range, but knew it would even out with the washer and dryer in the apartment. It is a good size and the parking was not too bad.  Then another company comes in and buys the property. Still not too bad, but after awhile we noticed we had mice. We called multiple times and they did some quick fixes, putting out traps and covering 2 holes (after nothing they did worked and I had to do my own research). Through all of this the office manager was unfriendly and unhelpful, she went as far as to blame us. After trying to negotiate our rent (we didn't feel as tenants we should be paying $2400 for a 1-bedroom apartment), we were denied. We had to ask for an extension on our lease, due to having a hard time finding a new place to live (you know what I mean if you are a SJ native). As we were moving out, I realized how bad the mice infestation had been. Along the walls behind the furniture we don't move, was mouse droppings and pee. I was mortified...so much that I left all my food in the fridge! After filing a complaint and having our lawyers send out a letter, they blamed us and painted us as bad tenants.

Go ahead and move here, I'm sure it's not common practice, because the folks that work in the office are very friendly and personable. It's just the manager that needs some extensive training on customer service. Just be on top of it, don't think that the manager cares about your needs, or the safety of your family. And be aware that mice are a problem, and have been a problem in that particular building. Maybe with the upgrades they'll fix it all.

Oh, I forgot to mention, I got my car stolen twice, within a two week span, so your car insurance may increase depending on where you're moving from. And the spiders and bugs are in excess due to the water being so close. They also spread pesticides once a year over that part of the city.

Good luck.<//Text>

Covid-19 update review. I'd like to give a shout out to Kyle and the mngr Mike in the maintenance department. My microwave stopped working right before covid, we got a counter top replacement right away, thank you Mike! But as soon as they were allowed to come in to fix non emergency my man Kyle comes to the rescue! He has come on a few occasions while I am working from home and he makes sure he does not interrupt and does work quick and effectient. He fixed the microwave and sink. Before covid, he fixed a few other things. Kyle is super cool, super respectful and really does a wonderful job!</review>

< Review>
This is a terrible place to live and would not recommend anyone to rent from here. Through my experience here, this is by far the worst place I have lived. Not only are they WAY overpriced, but some of their staff are just ridiculous to try to work with.

Paying nearly $2k/month for outdated kitchen, doors, windows, blinds, etc. is just a little ridiculous. It would be one thing if you were living in an much needed upgraded apartment. The apts don't even come with microwaves and you get half sized washer/dryer's as well. When you have to pay extra for your pets, I expect a little something for the outrageous price they charge you. Their "dog park" is an absolute joke. Some tiny craphole (literally), stuffed away in a corner where no one picks up their dogs poop.  It is like walking into a landmine field. The poop bags are scarce throughout the area as well.

When it comes to the staff, there is one person that completely ruined our experience, as well as some of our neighbors here. Monica was a complete b***h. This is not an understatement, she talked to you as if she was better than you.  Always had a bad attitude and was always on a power trip. If she didn't like something, she would send you a notice saying "multiple neighbors" complained about this, when it was just her.  She always had a scowl on her face and made our stay very unpleasant. Also, sometimes the workers seemed a little lackluster to complete their jobs. They would take their time and make it very inconvenient for you with the amount of time they took walking in and out of your apartment.

In the end, I would not recommend Foxchase to anyone looking for a good priced, quality apartment community.  There are plenty of others, in San Jose, to choose from and I would definitely go with one of those.<//Review>

I love living at Foxchase.  I do not know how the prior review came up with the comments that he expressed.  The only thing remotely true is the reasonable rent for these completely renovated apartments.  The office staff is unmatched by any other staff with which I have worked.  The maintenance staff is also excellent:  responsive, competent, compasionant.  This complex it top notch and worth every penny!  If you are looking for an apartment thia shoul be first on your short list,  Kathleen Jack<//Text>

<Text>Store was very clean and well organized. Staff was nice and informed me of all the specials. Eben when checking out, if something was on special, they would remind me to get more.

Good quality frames and art supplies. Custom matting and framing. Fun to browse but the prices even during a sale are a bit high. You can get many of the same supplies cheaper by visiting several other stores around town.<//review>

<UserId.>116149616784576750942</UserId.><Text>While the frames are made off-site so you can expect the same high quality at any of their locations - the staff at this location are top notch! They have worked with us on several framing projects, and have never disappointed. When the corner of a print they framed for us began to lift (due to how we stored the original, and not their work; protip: don't store prints rolled!), they took it and repaired it for us without additional charge. We have even had occasions where we were told of upcoming sales that would save us money rather than ordering immediately. The staff at this location are very focused on customer service and building a long term relationship, rather than making a quick buck like some other framing shops I've used in the past!<//Text>< gmapID>

The employees here are totally delightful people. I would come here just for the conversation. They do a great job with custom framing, although it's quite expensive, and the staff is REALLY helpful and patient.</Text>

Great place to support local! They have a good variety of nuts, fruits, and veggies. They also sell snacks, honey, jams, dried food, dairy products (incl local free range eggs) and yummy treats for dessert. Grab a succulent while you're at it! And of course they're very kind.</text>

<rate>5</rate><text>A fantastic place to visit while you are in the magical little town of Winters, a hidden treasure near Lake Solano. You will be overwhelmed by their assortment (see my photos, too). It's like literally getting a taste of the magic of this area. Their prices are incredibly decent and staff most friendly. It's like stepping in a beautiful fairytale, except this one is real. Once you have been there, you will want to go back, even long for it.<//text>< Pictures>

I have visited this Fruit Stand a few times ever since Covid-19 and I have relished on the juicy fruits and sweet items. I especially liked their dried pineapples and their plums were sweet with the right kind of bitterness. I hope more people give this a try!< /Review>

If you ever have issues with products at our markets we are happy to give you a refund or replace your items. We do take these concerns seriously. If you can, please go to Fort Mason and return the items so we can gladly give you a refund . We sell a large amount of walnuts and it is rare that we receive complaints so we do take this seriously.'}< /Response>
< review>
Bought a pound of raw walnuts at the Fort Mason Farmers Market two weeks ago.  I thought anything at a farmers market should be great, fresh, better than you get at a supermarket. Also like helping out producers directly instead of Whole Foods etc. Sad news to say the walnuts were completely flavorless.  Worse than bland.  Tried toasting them for a sundae.  Still completely without flavor.  Never again from this place.</review>

This place is a hidden gem. Yes, if you don't live in Winters, this is not exactly "on the way" anywhere, but it's definitely worth the visit if you can stop by. There are lots of fresh vegetables, fruits, and other things that are super tasty. My favorite was the spicy dried mangoes, which didn't even make their way home, because they were consumed in the car.</review>

Unfortunately apricots are at the tail end of the season right now (old fashioned varieties are out of season) and tomatoes are barely just starting in the area due to the bad weather (climate change and rains in May). Pluots are currently in season which might explain why they were good. As an agricultural business that relies heavily on the weather, seasons and varieities, we understand some products might not always be satisfactory. Thank you for your feedback.'}</Resp>

I have been with State Farm for a few years, April is my agent. Even though we've never met in person, she feels like a dear friend to me. She has gone above and beyond in her customer service skills; even in her personal time. April has helped me save money with great suggestions many times. She has always taken care of us in all circumstances; there have been many. I would, and do, recommend April, over at State Farm to anyone. Thank you April for being the best!</Review>

Alyssa had helped me earlier with my previous apartments' renters insurance. I was so impressed with the quick service she provided. This year I contacted her myself so that she can provide me with renter's insurance for my new apartment. As expected, she was so easy to connect with , all my work was done within 30 minutes. I  would highly recommend her if anyone wants to get their renter's insurance done. I have found my permanent go to person for upcoming renter's insurance. :)< /Text>

My agent April Aguirre, was knowledgeable, understanding and most of all kind. She made me feel at ease knowing she had all the answers to my questions.

<text>Kim Whippie with State Farm Insurance Agency in Glendora is one of the best insurance agents I have ever had.

Alyssa has been the most helpful representative at State Farm. We currently have a home policy and 3 cars insured under State Farm and when we ask for quotes and have any questions in regards to our policy we always get a call back immediately and email confirmations. My husband has been insured with this agency since he was around 16 years old he’s now 48 and we have been so happy them! Great pricing & friendly service go a long way!< /Text>

I want to thank Kimberly Whippie for all the hard work you do.
You are so willing to help at anytime and I appreciate that.
You go above and beyond what work requires.  You take your time helping me and you never rush me.  You look for the best coverage for me.
You even help both my sons too.
Thank you Kim.< /Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>So. Gotta Say Vanessa Garcia is hands down the best agent i've ever operated with within the insurance realm. Most of the time, you never know who you can trust in this industry...however whenever I need help, she is the one who gets me taken care of, always does her best to give me the best deals she can and qualify me for the most competitive rates and always ends our conversations with laughs and great vibes. I not only would but already have recommended so many friends and family members to this branch solely because of her service and hope she is seen and respected amongst her peers for her outstanding work. #RealTalk< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Time>1570832707742<//Time>< user>

<text>I read online that State Farm had bank products. So I walked in while getting my haircut next door and asked if they can help. The girl at the front desk April explains everything about the credit card I wanted to apply for. She even advised me through what she thought was best. I have had this card for 4 months now and I've had one question. When I called they were able to answer my question without putting me on hold or make me wait. They have a very friendly staff that's been around for a long time! You won't waste your time coming here. You'll get what you're looking for.<//text>< UserId.>

Kim responded fast and efficiently to her sub-contractor's needs.  I appreciate that and I know her client does too.  Kim helps both of us do our job better.

Hilda Granados is an outstanding agent, she has a great team in her corner. Most of the time when I need help, I call and ask for Kimberly Whippie, maybe because she has helped me since day one. Kim provides excellent customer service, she is on top of things and will get things done no matter what. Kim goes above and beyond to make this customer happy. I appreciate all you do.

<text>Being a State Farm customer has been a pleasure, and I owe it all to Sandra Cardenas because of her consistent attentiveness, courtesy, trustworthiness and quick responsiveness.  Anytime I have a question or issue regarding my policy, I know my mother and I can reach out to her and be pleased with her assistance. Thank you Sandra for your outstanding and excellent service as our insurance agent!</text><Gmap_id>0x80c3262fcb4c7bb3:0x8504fc14c4f60ea1< /Gmap_id><pictures>None</pictures><rating>5</rating><time>1485893276432<//time>< response>

Sandy Enciso is always one of the first smiling faces I see once I walk through that door. I always go in to make my payments with her (I prefer interacting with friendly people rather than technology) she's awesome!</review><Date>1490854129805<//Date>< Name>

<Review>I have been with State Farm for over 6 years now and I have been extremely satisfied. Sandra Cardenas my agent has been AWESOME! She notifies me of any new changes with my policy and works directly with my work to update any new changes. Sandra is extremely professional and is a true respectable agent.

Thank you Sandra!< /Review>< rate>

Have been with Sate Farm Insurance for a while now. We are very happy with the service and the customer support that we have received. There has been many occasions where we need imidiate help from representatives and they are always so fast in responding to us. I have recommended our agent many time with family and friends. It is a pleasure and a privilege to be with Sate Farms!!! Thank you.</review>

Kimberly Whippie always makes me feel comfortable. I trust her and know that she has my best interest at heart. She goes above and beyond and that is why I am still with State Farm after so many years.  She explained a policy that I had that allowed me to pull cash out with zero penalties. I was unaware that my universal life policy allowed me to do so. I thank her for saving me by informing me. I was just about to pull from my 401k.< /text>

My family has been with HG for over 20 years. Kimberly Whippie is the best! She is very helpful and always answers my questions. I have a very busy schedule as most of us do, and when I need to report my miles or have a quick question I know I can send an email and count on Kim to respond to me. Thank you Kim for all of your help and for putting up with my family!</review>

Adding vehicles, removing vehicles from insurance, and ultimately dealt with them when I was in accidents. Simple, fast, and efficient is what comes to mind.

My exeperience having Leslie Carrillo as my agent is more than just security for my self and my future daughter to come. It's one less thought of stress knowing I am in good hands. All state says they have people I. Good hands but not like my State Farm agent leslie.

My mama has "triple A" (AAA) and let's just say she gets a little jealous that she get put on hold when calls her insurance agency. But with leslie my calls, questions, and concerns get answered before you can say State Farm. Not even kidding. This place is legit. I appreciate the personal at this agency and can't stress that enough.

So if your looking for insurance and a peace of mind  Leslie Carrillo will easily have that covered.

<Text>I have been insured by State Farm Insurance for over ten years and just recently I had my car, which is a convertible Toyota Solara, vandalized. The convertible top was ripped horribly and the right side passenger window was shattered with glass sprawled everywhere. To top it off it apparently happened on New Years while I was out of town. As soon as I became aware of the situation I contacted Kim Whippie. She immediately provided me with the information I needed to begin my claim. Once my claim was submitted I was scheduled for a vehicle inspection. The inspector provided the estimate and I was handed a check for the damages. I was also given a detailed list of the companies that provided State Farm with the estimates. Thereafter, I took my car in for repair, only to find out additional issues were identified. The repair shop contacted State Farm and another inspection was scheduled within a few days. After the 2nd inspection State Farm approved of the additional repairs and issued another check directly to the company repairing my car. Overall I just want to say that State Farm is the most professional and prompt insurance company that I have ever worked with. I use State Farm for car, home and renters insurance and because of that and my good driving record I receive discounts; that helps when you're on a budget. For the majority of my dealings with State Farm I have worked with Kim and she has repeatedly provided exceptional service. Her professionalism and friendly personality make me feel like family. Thank you Kim for your outstanding customer service as well as your prompt assistance each time I've needed it!! For anyone looking for a prompt, professional, honest and trustworthy insurance company with State Farm you will find just that!!< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I am so glad to have found LaCour’s Lion’s Den. The vibe in this barber shop is honestly like no other I have found. The barbers are courteous and welcoming. The haircuts are the best I have ever had. Cody goes out of his way to communicate with me when scheduling appointments and makes himself available often. I like the choice of music in the shop and how clean everything is. I’m grateful for this shop and Cody is a pillar to the community. I will continue to go here for my haircuts and bring my 2 sons to this place. The quality is unprecedented and I recommend this place for all looking to get a clean cut.</Review>

If the prices seem higher than others (based on other reviews), it's because the experience is much better. As they say, you get what you pay for.

A little pricey for me personally, but you are definitely paying for quality. These guys put in the time for every customer to get your hair where you want it. Great fades, good talks. Not a bad wait either if you get there early.<//Text>

< Review>
First time coming to this barber shop and I must admit that the atmosphere is very relaxed, and the barbers themselves are quite skilled in what they do. I would also add that it is difficult do find barbers that can cut "mixed" hair but barber Cody LaCour did a immaculate job. This place moving forward will have my business.<//Review>

I brought my teen son here this morning at the recommendation of his youth pastor and didn’t know what to expect but trusted the referral.
I can now absolutely recommend coming here!

Was greeted professionally at the door, was advised the safety precautions in place, and advised to keep my mask on while I waited as all barbers did as well. The time they take, with their fine attention to detail is a cut above the rest. My son has unruly thing long curls and they did a fantastic job. Great vibe, good energy & good music - plus, cold AC on a hot day. Would comfortably recommend any male friend, teen, or boy to come here! Support a small business's directly instead if a chain, come here and look better for it! Thank you, Zaundia</text>

Barbers value your well being and respect more than anything. They take their time on the cut to ensure it is beyond your satisfaction. No rushing to get it done. Great professionalism throughout the shop. I have been going to the same barber Cody since I’ve got to Cali. Never been disappointed! HIGHLY Recommend this place!<//Review>

While not the cheapest barber in the local area, you will get the best haircut around. The barbers take their time and make sure every detail of the cut looks amazing. Very good service.< /Text>

<Review>I’ve been a resident of Oceanside/Vista area since 1997, I am also a proud United States Marine Retired of over 20 years. Through my Military and personal experience, I know to give credit where credit is due. That said, Cody is a bright intelligent young man that has definitely earned my respect. His vision for success is not only his beautiful barbershop but more importantly how he got to this beautiful barbershop. His selfless acts has gained a plethora of the Communities respect as he always thinks of different ways to give back. The attention to detail and perfection attitude per each haircut/beard cuts are what sold my two boys ages 16 and 6 and I to be loyal and stay with him and his crew. Get out there and pass the word!!! You won’t be disappointed ✊🏽💯< /Review>< pics>

<text>I havent had much experience in going to Barbers before yesterday, but this was the best experience in any haircut facility I have ever gone to. This was a huge day for us since this was the day that not only did my husband get a transformation, but our 4 year old was getting his very first big boy haircut!  We were the luckiest people to get Cody Lacour as our Barber! This shop was extremely clean and professionaland had an amazing vibe to it! Cody treated me and my family beyond well and made sure that ALL of us were comfortable the whole time! He took the time and the care with my son to ensure he was completely comfortable every long step of the way! He definitely transformed my husband and son completely and they look beyond AMAZING! Cody has us as clients Forever! Too bad I couldn't rate him past the 5 stars because he was better than 5 stars! Thank you Cody for the best experience! We are forever greatful for our son's AMAZING first haircut!<//text>< Pics>

Won't honor slight expired coupons when most will.
Don't serve chocolate cones any more. Thats what kept me going there in the 1st place. Not any more!
When a sm burger combo & 2x one pies costs over $10 at what was supposed to be the burger place people could afford to feed the family get like this. Time to say goodbye. I won't be going back there.</text>

<text>I get that work in fast food demands speed to get the food out. But when I am ordering food to be delivered and paying the extra cost for that. It is almost an insult when I have to go to the restaurant to get my order corrected. Why am I wasting money on delivery if the order is wrong? And what was wrong about this order??? The drink...how????? It is too frustrating that restaurants are doing this and I'm not getting the money back that I wasted to get it delivered so I dont have to go to the restaurant in the first place.<//text><Name>Trevon Collins< /Name>< date>

<review>Took a 20 mile bicycle ride here from Wilshire/Vermont redline station and didn't expect the outdoor dining to be shut down. The food was good though and the fries were fresh out of the fryer. I had to be sneaky and utilize one of the outdoor tables to eat. This would be a 4 star if the outdoor dining was open. One more star if the area wasn't infested w/ meth heads running around w/ no shoes or sleeping at the nearby bus stop bench in the middle of the day. I saw at least 3 of them during my visit here.< /review></record>

I used to love coming here but now it has gone downhill. For a place that is supposed to have a fast drive thru, they don't. Even with no one in line. The building is dilapidated, speakers don't work, the facade of the building is falling off. The owner of the franchise should be appalled. Then they have the audacity to charge you 40 cents for a ranch or any other sauce... When the order you bought is chicken bites?!! Sadly I will not be returning.<//Review>

The food is always good, the fact that their customer service is bad it just makes you not want to go back. Im assuming the manager was the one that took my order over drive thru.  He doesnt let you finish your order just tells you to pull foward, i told him to give me a sec. He just stood quiet and turned off the headset, i had to say "hellooo" like 5x. Once at the window. i handed him my debit card and he didnt even try to reach out for it, gave me my food and slammed there window. Horrible. You should quit if your not happy with your job.< /review>

First off, the Rally Fries are one of a kind deliciousness! If you haven't tried it, its a must!! They have Good simple food that wont disappoint. The prices are pretty economical and they always have deals to offer you! They have Burgers, chicken bites, mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, koolAid slushies and soft serve ice cream. That's why YOU HAVE TO TRY THE WICKED STRAWBERRY SOFT SERVE!! Amazing!! Cant wait to have it again!< /Review>

Been coming here for years. Icecream is great and they never tell me they run out or that the machine is not working. Fries, good. Hamburgers, good. Pigeons are a pain in the butt but just don't feed them so they'll go away. Great place to stop by after playing at the park.< /text>

It's an outside meal place. Noisy,loud friends is never a problem.  The lighting is moderate  it's nice for cozy..  the establishment sits on a busy corner,  sites and familiar  encounters are accessible and spontaneous.</review>

<review>I spent almost 15 minutes in the drive thru and the cashier didn't even apologize for it. It was after midnight and there was just 1 car in front of me. I would have left but there was a car behind me.
They also forgot my dressing ketchup and missing one of my burger.
Horrible service absolutely terrible. I don't think Im going back.</review>< pics>

Well my experience I really wasn't that great we arrived and there was a long line drive through her therefore we decided to get out of the car and ordered when we got there and we were ordered over to connect 45 to 55 minutes to be done our food was done plus we wanted to sit down and eat and when we wanted to download table for 30 the trash cans are overflowing with trash really bad expectations for this place</Review>

Good food at a great price only knocking down a star as they have repeatedly forgotten items from my order and I only realize this when I end up home. 5 out of 5 if you check your bag before you leave the drive thru</text>

<review>The food is good and really cheap. I went and got their 2$ combo that includes a rallyburger with cheese and a small fries. Then I just went across the street to the little market on the other side of florence to buy a soda for a dollar ten and I filled up on three dollars and thirty something cents :)
The burgers are about medium size but they're good and will fill you up. The fries taste really good.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>105869578860542888546</userid><time>1463347556802</time><Gmap_id>0x80c2c94a5a3407b1:0xdb61d740c753bda4</Gmap_id><Rate>5</Rate><Name>Juan Chavez< /Name>< Response>

The food is pretty good. But Do not dine in on the outside patio, because the pigeons don't let you eat comfortable and aren't scared of people and get really close to you and don't get frightened when you scare them.< /review>
