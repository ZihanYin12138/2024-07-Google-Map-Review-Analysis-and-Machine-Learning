<Text>I really hate saying bad things about local businesses  but the pizza I ordered for take out was terrible!  Honestly, for $20 I expected more.  It was undercooked and doughy inside.  The overall taste was equivalent to a Digionos frozen pizza. I could not finish even 1 slice.  The cheese had an off taste to it as well.  Needless to say my stomach did not take it well and required 4 tums to remedy.  I may go back and try other items on the menu but I am steering clear of the pizza.<//Text>< UserId.>

<Review>I tried this establishment on the recommendation of a friend and was not impressed. My BBQ chicken pizza was bland, and I'm used to that particular type of pizza being flavorful, I had to doctor up the children's spaghetti, because my son said it had no taste to it and he was right, and his fries weren't tasty either. About the only thing that prove to be flavorful was the cinnamon dessert and ice cream, which is why I gave it two stars. Lesson learned, this is just not my style of food, so on to the next!< /Review>< Pics>

Great food and ambiance but a bit too loud (music) if you're trying to have a conversation while you eat. At least on the first level. I know they have a second level which may not be as loud. But the food and service is pretty good!</Review>

<review>What a fabulous place! Enjoyed the comfy booth seats and ordered a veggie pizza with added toppings and a Mango Beer. Fabulous! Enjoyed all the tv’s and the service was outstanding. Took our time, didn’t feel rushed. Even had leftovers to bring home and I have to say even better the second day! Thank you for a romantic, enjoyable dining experience.< /review>< pics>

Always delicious.  Did the smart thing and go there early on Friday to avoid the dinner rush. Was sat immediately and order their special pizza. This one had their house made meatballs and it was outstanding.< /Text>

All of our pizzas come automatically with cheese, unless you specifically request no cheese.

We also offer a gluten free crust or cauliflower crust that  I guarantee would not disappoint.  You can stop by anytime and we will make this right and ideally put an end to your search for the perfect Margarita pizza.

I really like this place. The waiter's are always constantly check in making sure the food, service and environment is top notch. They're garlic knots are my fav along with their happy hour margaritas. Eber is amazing. Always on top of the orders and making sure the service is 5 stars. After a rough day at the office I enjoy coming here. I love their pizzas. Happy hour is great. And I always ref people here. Lunch hour is perfecto! The staff here is amazing! Brian is another person who is definitely on top of service and food! Thanks guys!< /review>

<Text>I love Oggi's pizza!  By far, my favorite place to get pizza from.  A little bit thicker than NY style, but not too much.  Great selection of their own and guest beers, and a lot of TVs to watch sports on while you eat.  They have a lot of different food on the menu besides pizza as well, and a lot of great lunch specials too.  Highly recommend this place.< /Text><time>1549952979239< /time>< resp>

<review>I have been to a few Oggi's spread across San Diego. I have not found many variances with the food.

The large pizza is a good size for 2 adult men. Nothing too exciting to say about it.

We also had ordered a Gluten Free Personal pizza with the works (basically a supreme). She enjoys it.</review>< Pics>

I did have onions on my salad they were awesome' which made the salad very tasty.  they  Pickled the onions.  I dont think they should get three stars but shy of 4</review>

We decided pizza and a local competitor to Oggi's had closed. So, an online order to Oggi's. Custom pizza. The pizza tasted "canned." That is the "homemade sauce" was probably from a can, and the olives tasted like the can, aka old olives. The crust was terrible and I guess I had not learned from the last time we went to Oggi's to eat. Poor quality. That tears it.<//text>

<Review>Sports bar and grill with PIZZA.
They have beer, wine, liquor, mixed drinks and more.
Seems like they always have about 3$ mimosas and 5$ margaritas.

Food took about 30 minutes to arrive.
Pizza looked and tasted good but did not come out as ordered.
The manager compensated that pie and gave me another one to go that was correct for no charge. Very kind of him. ++

Ingredients looked and tasted fresh.++

Overall, not a bad spot to get some food, alcohol and have a plethora of things to watch on the TV.

Seems like a lively atmosphere and is probably a good bar spot to make some friends or at least meet some fellow imbibers.

(The quinoa sliders on the menu sounded good but I went with the veggie pizza instead)
Hope this was helpful!</Review>< GmapID>

Terrible service. The bar tender was more interested in talking to patrons from the harbor than taking care of the other customers in the room. Food came out coldish, and the cost for this experience was too high.  This update was for the owner who wanted more detail. I will not be back.< /Text>

<time>1501639222873</time><Rating>1< /Rating><text>Ok food and chill place to hang out. Terrible service.  They overcharged us the last two times wet came but we decided to give it another shot today.  Bad idea.
They never came out to the patio to serve us. We ended up going to the bar to get the drinks and asked if we can get service. They debated back and forth who should come out to serve, and even after they figured it out, no one served us! We left. Never coming here again.</text>< pics>

This is a nice place for pizza, beer, and sports. The bar isn't the biggest but they have a nice staff that will find you a seat. Craft beer and food is well worth the trip.<//Review>

Terrible service. The bar tender was more interested in talking to patrons from the harbor than taking care of the other customers in the room. Food came out coldish, and the cost for this experience was too high.  This update was for the owner who wanted more detail. I will not be back.< /Review>

The staff is absolutely amazing.   Brian, Alvarado, Brandy. The best people. If you get a chance to converse with them, it will change any preconceived notions about Cifornia.
Thank you all so much for making us feel like family everytime we stop in.

Just came back for the 10th time. Always get something different. Never disappointed.  If you come here get whatever they have on menu. As always Brian and all his staff are to perfection.

I would appreciate it if you can help me a little bit more and can tell me the exact day and time that this happened so as to help us find a better way to avoid these problems. We take pride in serving fresh, hot food here at Oggi's and we apologize that you haven't received that experience.

< Review>
I've tried oggi's twice now, both times take out.

The first time they got one of the three orders wrong and gave me fish and chips instead of a kale chopped salad. It was my mistake not to check before I left but I waited >15 minutes in the restaurant to get it because I was mostly ignored the first 10 minutes while my food sat on the shelf getting cold. I had to re-heat all the hot food when I got home.

I tried them again a couple nights ago thinking maybe my first experience was a fluke. It wasn't. They had a giant white board behind the cash registers that said "there are too many people on this earth. We need a plague." I had to read it twice, like what the hell? Every staff member was staring at screens and seemingly overwhelmed by their job. I waited and waited and no one even looked at me or greeted me. I asked three different people for my take out and each time was told someone else will get it. I could see the bag behind them with my name on it!

I finally got my food after >10 minutes of waiting and was given the wrong change when I paid cash, to be exact I was shorted 90 cents. I paid exact change and should have just received $3 back. Rocket science to that hostess.

Food was ok at best. Cold once again by the time I finally got it.

I won't be trying them again.<//Review>

Don't call ahead because he won't give you a reservation for 15, but when you get there and seated by the hostess he'll tell you to wait over 30 minutes because there is a party or 30 reserved for the seat you're in. Better to go to Mother Earth tasting room in Vistas and have a cold Cali Creamin' while you wait for a pizza and salad from Coal Fired Pizza.</Text>< Rating>

<Review>Great place... My family love the sausages there on the pizza and on the calzone... I don't like beef or pork but they have a great selection.. Even if it's just cheese pizza its good... The thin crust I would recommend to everyone trying...my 4th time being there today and I had the turkey buger and got to build it the way I like it..   You don't get that many fries but it was enough for me... Over all5 stars.. Thanks Oggi's</Review><user_id>101691923225513412547<//user_id></record></dataset><record>

Horrible....If I could give less than 1 star I would.   I got there today at 11:30 with a group of ladies from a senior community....I was early so she.....with the red or purple hair.....sat me in a back area.   She was very helpful and brought water and menus.....then the other 4 ladies arrived appx. 11:45...... there was no one in the area we were in at that time.  People started filling up the place for lunch......we had to ask to get our orders taken......finally she (whoever that was) took our order....others that came after got bar drinks....food orders...before 4 of our party got our food....mine......was not there at all......others that came later were already leaving after finishing their lunch.   my friends were finishing theirs and I still still didn't have my lunch....I went out the red/purple haired girl and just said....look  when my lunch ever comes.....I will not pay for it.   Finally they brought me a side salad....which I didn't order.....and then when she brought my sandwich.....it was in a to go box.   I asked....just for the heck of it...what was the problem....OH WE GOT BACKED UP IN THE KITCHEN.....REALLY!   there was no one there when we arrived.
tacky, tacky, tacky.....then they kept trying to rub in how they "compted"
(sp) my lunch....I said absolutely not....I refused to pay for it.<//Text>

If you enjoy terrible service and paying way too much for food, then by all means come here. The only times I've ever been to an Oggis was for a party of some sort, I would never choose to come here on my own. I'm afraid to get yelled at by the staff, is this fear justified?<//review>

<review>As always Oggis delivers. We been to different ones in both Arizona and California and the same applies to both. Attentive waiting staff, a fantasic selection of both local and their own brewed beer and a decent American style cuisine that they will make sure tastes good. We've had subpar sandwiches and they made sure that we were satisfied. Good stuff and definitely recommending for a quick dinner with a good beer.<//review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

The worse service ever. Sitting at the bar and could not get survice so had to ask the bus boy for a drink. Asked for a to go box and it took over half an hour. It was not that busy. This place sucks.< /Review>

The pizza certainly isn't as good as it was when Oggi's was in this location before. Slow service also. The pizza was supposed to have an olive oil and garlic sauce, except there was no olive oil and barely any garlic, so not so good.<//review>

<review>Efficient check in and X rays. Dr. Kipper was very direct in diagnosis, was clear with suggested treatment option (3), and very deft at administering a cortisone shot. Hopefully the injection works.</review>< pictures>

Ex-rays taken prior to seeing him,  he was to the point,  explained thumb/hand damage, answered questions, gave options which was extremely helpful especially considering  a hand issue and the thought of surgery  is HUGH for me.

Dr Kupperman was a great support today when I went in for a cortisone shot for my thumbs and he explained the newest finding about cortisone and the Covid vaccine.I had my 2nd dose only 9 days ago so  he suggested I wait another week to be sure that it did not interfere with my vaccine. Thank you doctor for you continuous update and knowledge for your patients heath. This is want we all want from a good conscious physician. I feel trust now more than ever.</Review>

I received immediate and excellent professional care. Dr.Kupperman made time to see me the very day I called for an appointment. He gave me a thorough diagnosis and a referral to a specialist for my condition.The staff and the Doctor were very helpful and efficient. I highly recommend Alta Orthopedics.< /text>

<review>He's super-competent, listens to me and responds to my issues and questions effectively. He takes my wishes into account. He's also very open about treatment plan options, which helps me make better, more informed decisions. I like his clear, direct manner. My total shoulder replacement was extremely successful and I regained full range of motion about 4 months out, a little earlier than expected. Highly recommend.<//review>< Pics>

Dr Kupperman went over the MRI with me and answered all my questions until I understood the injury and repair or non-repair options. He was able to re attach my bicep tendon even though the injury was 6 weeks old. He uses the latest techniques and materials.  I am sure glad for his skills.<//Text>

Dr. Kupperman is an outstanding orthopedic surgeon and reviewed the symptoms and injury that I was having with my hand and wrist with exceptional detail and clarity.

Dr. Kupperman developed a successful surgical plan to assist me with multiple problems with my hand and wrist. The surgery was very successful and corrected the problems I was having.

He is very professional, friendly and courteous. He explains the medical situation and surgical procedure very well and in clear terms.<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><review>Mr. Smoot has gone above and beyond to help my daughter. I have taken my daughter to numerous specialists and nobody has helped my daughter as much as Mr. Smoot has helped her. The staff is friendly, appointment times are great. Waiting time is above excellent. As soon as you sit down on the waiting room they call your name. Office is really clean. I highly recommend Mr. Smoot. My daughter is really happy with the outcome and the way he has helped her. He is dedicated and it shows he likes what he does, he has a kind heart. Thank you Mr. Smoot.< /review>< Pictures>

Decided to go to Smoot Family Chiropractic and was evaluated and treated. We are currently in their chiropractic care and so far it has really improved our posture and range of motions. We will continue with the maintenance plan of regular chiropractic service with Dr Smoot. They are also very family oriented and they really know you. We highly recommend Smoot Chiropractic!!!

Dr. Smoot and his team are awesome! When I first started coming I had recently thrown out my low back. I also had pain between my shoulders blades, in my neck, and also some associated symptoms of migraines as well as hand numbness and tingling. He took X-rays the first visit which showed my low back had actually rotated and that I had a bone spur at the second to last vertebrae in my neck (probably due to computer work and poor posture). The first adjustment was explosive to say the least, but I felt really good afterwards. Now, after about 2 months of treatment, my back and neck pain are minimal, I’m no longer having migraines or any of the numbness/tingling in my hands. The staff is super friendly, efficient, timely, and are always willing to help. Additionally, Dr. Smoot has a great philosophy of treatment. He explained during the first visit that he aims to actually correct spinal issues when possible and that the treatment goes beyond simply “feeling good.” Most people start going to a chiropractor when they are in pain and only go maybe once or twice until they improve symptomatically. However, the problem usually recurs soon after and people come back in when they have pain again. The longer treatment plans that he prescribes (plus maintenance work afterwards) are geared to make sure that you stay in good shape long term and prevent any future damage to the spine itself.  I highly recommend coming here if you are seeking chiropractic care!</review>

<Review>I’ve been to a couple of chiropractor spots around town and this place is the best one I’ve been to so far. The pain I was experiencing before the care and after going has drastically changed. I feel a lot better while doing normal activities and feel better when lifting as well. I was dealing with constant headaches and constant pain in my mid back and left side of my shoulder/scapula area. Dr. Smoot is very professional and is there to really listen to your needs and help you out any way he can help you feel better by either providing care or providing workouts/stretches to do at home. The two ladies working there are also very welcoming and very polite with each and every one of the clients that go into the office. If there’s anybody out there looking for chiropractic care or is in any sort of pain and is looking to get the best care, I’d recommend to check this place out without a doubt.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
So I came in with lower back pain,upper back pain and really terrible neck pain. I was like this for a few years and saved up some money to go see a chiropractor. So Dr.Smoot broke everything down to me and put me on a month and a half plan to get me back on track.

I was a little skeptical at first,but after he put me on the next plan, so in total I've been going for about two and a half months. I feel amazing not going lie. I do Martial Arts and I've been going back recently and I have no issues! Neck and back feel great! So thank you Dr.Smoot!</Review>

<Text>Smoot Family Chiropractic is different from the other places. Rather then try to hide under some other type of practice name or over prescribe, Dr. Smoot and his team go over everything with you in a calming and informative matter. I immediately started feeling relief from my neck and back pain and look forward to continuing my healing with their help.<//Text><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

Dr. Smoot has brought my smile & laughter back. 🤗I went to see him, tears 😭and all. I could barely walk, roll over in bed, get up from bed, sit down for long periods, and need help to get out of a sitting position. With his help and his staff they have made my appointments worth it. I'm able to continue to do things I love with the people I love. ♥️ What's more important than that?😊😊😊</text>

Dr. Brian Smoot did an awesome job in finding my issues with my back. Mostly lower back pain and put me on a regiment of adjustments and therapy.  He also recommended some dietary changes and recommend exercise like walking more often.

After a year, I did find myself improved upon.

I recommend that you review your insurance policy to see how much it will cover, like other therapies a portion may be covered and the rest is out of pocket.  But, it really comes down to how you feel after six months.</Text>

< Review>
I have been to other chiropractic offices before. The type of service and treatment I had received before is nothing compare to what I have received in this office. Everything that Dr. Smoot explain to me was so true. I didn't have to explain in detail where I had the pain. After we went through my X-ray results, he pointed every single spot where I was having problems. Everything he was describing was very true. He went through a treatment plan with me right after. I can say that it didn’t take very long before I stared to see a difference with my pain. My pain was going away.  I was sleeping better. I started jogging. I was even able to carry my son again. I feel great now!! From all the other Chiropractic, he is the one who has been able to resolve my problem. I truly appreciate what he has done for me and my family.<//Review>

The best referrals are word of mouth referrals and I ended up in Dr. Smoot’s office as such. My experience there was so great that I actually drove out of my way for my appointments. The staff is courteous, highly knowledgeable and I felt truly cared for. I don’t live in the area anymore but I plan to return and I have no doubt this will be my place to go for chiropractic care!< /Text>

<review>I started going to Dr. Smoot last year after experiencing a medical issue. I had just retired and had accumulated lots of neck and back pain. Dr. Smoot performed a thorough exam and really took time to listen to me as I described my physical issues. He explained in detail what was happening to my body and developing a comprehensive plan to help my body return to a normal state with the goal of relieving much of the pain and being able to improve my mobility. Over the next weeks and months I saw tremendous improvement. It’s been almost a year now and I can honestly say that my quality of life has dramatically improved as a result of Dr. Smoot’s work with me! The entire office staff is wonderful too!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< gmapID>

<text>I highly recommend Dr Smoot for all your chiropractic needs. He helped me through knee pain, pregnancy related back pain and got me realigned after giving birth. He is very professional, kind and respectful. His office staff is amazing and I’ve never had to wait more than a couple minutes.< /text><rate>5</rate><user_name>Alyssa Alexander</user_name></record>

Dr Smoot family Chiroprator is a very friendly heart warming place. Dr Smoot takes care of his patients with care and treats everyone like a friend! I definitely recommend his practice. My back feels so much better from the first day I walked in for care.</Review>

Definately recommend going here! Even if you don't have any kind of pain/problems. My experience in the office was beyond great. Dr. Smoot and Valerie are very attentive, and not mention my overall physical improvement I am so glad I discovered this office and Chiropractic care 🙂</Review>

When i first visited Dr. Smoot for a preliminary check-up, I was in severe constant pain, had tingling, numbness and burning feelings running down my left arm....and could not muster the strength to hold my infant daughter for very long.  I was also not able to sleep or do physical activities (lifting, hiking, backpacking, bike riding, etc) which i enjoyed.

Dr. Smoot made my care a priority, explained the issues, and outlined a clear path of treatment that within weeks resulted in all numbness, tingling and burning pains diminishing.  With a routine "maintenance" schedule of appointments (every other week),  I have resumed normal sleep patterns, regained the ability to do the activities I desire, and have been able to physically interact with my now 2-year old daughter.

For the past 6+ months, I have absolutely pain free....all thanks to Dr. Smoot and his professional staff.< /Text>

Dr Smoot and his staff are so friendly and kind. Dr Smoot has been my Chiropracter for 3 years. It's a positive experience each time I visit him. He takes away my chronic aches and pains. I'm not one to pop a pill. And getting a weekly adjustment to maintain my health and well being is by far, better than taking pills. I highly recommend Dr. Smoot.<//Review>

Dr Smoot is the most AMAZING chiropractor I have ever been to.   It's not just his treatments which are the best, it's the caring and concern with which he conducts his practice.  Every question I had was answered in full.  His professionalism is always evident.  Dr. Smoots office staff is also a joy to deal with.  They are kind and very accommodating.   Their professionalism and courtesy never waivers.
If you are ever in need of chiropractic services I would highly recommend Dr Brian Smoot.</review>

Dr. Smoot is the absolute best! I cannot say enough good things about him.Two years ago I was experiencing severe headaches and could not seem to figure out why. After numerous doctors visits and unanswered questions, I paid a visit to Dr. Smoot. First off, his staff is very warm and welcoming. He makes you feel extremely comfortable and explains thoroughly what his treatment process consists of. Turns out, having regular adjustments and chiropractic care has completely relieved my headaches; all thanks to Dr. Smoot! I definitely plan to continue treatment for preventive and maintenance reasons, and would highly recommend Smoot Family Chiropractic to anyone!</Text>

I think every person who has ever visited a chiropractor develops a certain loyalty and trust to their doctor and trusting someone else to adjust me wasn't easy. My doctor in San Jose was amazing, so finding an equally amazing doctor in Salinas was very important but thankfully I found Dr. Smoot!

Finding Dr. Smoot was a blessing! I was pregnant when I started going and my baby's head was resting on my hip instead of the birth canal. With the help of Dr. Smoot my baby finally got into the right position right before I gave birth. After giving birth I continued to visit Dr. Smoot regularly and I also began taking my kids, even my newborn. My newborn had some issues with constipation and also with his head and neck, and having him adjusted was extremely helpful. I don't know how many people trust their tiny newborns to strangers or to doctors in general, but I had absolutely no second thoughts about Dr. Smoot adjusting my babies.

We have had a wonderful experience with Brian, he is a friendly and kind person who truly cares about his patients' well being. He is down to earth and always willing to explain and spend the time needed to answer any questions.</review>

Dr Smoot has made my life and my husband's life so much better. Any time we are having discomfort or pain, Dr Smoot has been able to help us feel better. He has had us both on a wellness plan that has helped us show great improvement over the last 2 years. We do not know where we would be without his professional, gentle approach. After time in his care, we are both able to be much more active, resulting in much better overall health. We would both recommend Dr Smoot very highly to anyone we meet!<//text>

He does more than adjusting me and send me on my way; he encouraged me to take a closer look at the quality of food I consume, and to become more active. I ran my first half marathon in November 2015 and received tons of advises from him.<//Text>< Pictures>

I made an appointment with Dr. Smoot after I developed sciatica. He and his staff are very professional and did a great job of explaining everything from billing to the cause of my pain. The chiropractic care that I received helped to eliminate my pain, so I continued to receive adjustments during and after my pregnancy for pain management.<//Text>

If you enjoy taking medications and it's side effects, keep seeing your doctor. If you'd prefer to live healthy and feel great naturally, then you MUST see Dr. Smoot. Dr. Smoot is an athlete himself. His approach to Chiropractic and Wellness is refreshing. Here's my short story;

I had used Dr. Smoot's services in the Summer of 2013. That Summer I was preparing for two half marathons and one Spartan Beast Race (a 13 mile obstacle course). I was training hard for the first time in my life. My body was in shock! During this intense three months of training, I was seeing Brian on a weekly basis. He not only provided adjustments but he also provided advice on how to train, and how to live healthy in general. I'm happy to say I got through all events feeling great and injury free! Dr. Smoot's focus on "Wellness" has earned him a patient for life! Thank you Dr. Smoot!< /review>

<text>As a past patient of Dr. Smoot, I completely recommend him to anyone thinking of seeing a chiropractor. When I first went in my body completely felt like it was shutting down. I had migraines 3-4 times a week and headaches the other days, my back hurt all the time, and I couldn't sleep.  I was SO TIRED. My doctor wanted to put me on medication for the migraines but that would mean I would no longer be able to nurse my baby. I decided against the medicine and fortunately not soon after my path crossed with Dr. Smoot. After the first adjustment I couldn't believe how quickly it eliminated the headaches! With further treatments my back felt better and I felt like me again!< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Honestly the best chiropractic care ever!! I never believed in chiropractic work I thought it was just a waste of money but Dr. Smoot sure changed my mind my son had been having back problems for 6 years he is only 13 so it's been so hard to understand why? If he's so young. I've done everything and nothing had helped. So I decided to try Dr.Smoot and he has been feeling great!! It amazes me how much he loves coming in. And the staff is amazing, it's nice to come in when all you see are big smiles and friendly people♡ I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could. Honestly if you're in pain and been skeptical about it just come and see for yourself. It'll be the best decision you can ever make♡< /review>

Since my younger years, till recently and threw out my life, I've had sevier injuries. Do to work or car accidents or do to someone else.
To name a few....
I was struck trying to push 2 people out of harm's way. So i was fiscally thrown over 15 feet by A SUV that was driven by a Drunken Driver.  My Head Broke The Wind Shield and I suffered head & Neck trauma. My Body was in excruciating pain as well. I was Rushed To ER.
I also suffered a roll over of 300 feet that left my legs crushed & tore all my ligaments from my waist down.. I suffered head trauma. It took me about 2 years to walk.
Threw out the years i experienced random symptoms of pain, cramping, shakes, and dizziness.
At work i dislocated my shoulder. I couldn't work do to the pain not only in my arm but my shoulder blade.
So many more things that my body has endured that it's taken a tole on my body threw out the years. I suffer from neck, back, arms, leg, and piercing pain all threw out my body at random times.. numerous times i felt numbness or tightness and even would get cramping with shaking or a piercing pain like a dagger. Since February 2019 my symptoms have somewhat diminished or improved. Some come and go. The numbness, cramping, and shaking is 70% gone. The back pain comes and goes yet it's improved with the adjustments. My neck stiffness & piercing pain improves with the adjustments.
I highly recommend Smooth Chiropractic. They treat you like family. Yet veary professional. At times I'd have Anxciety or my blood pressure was high, they made sure I was ok before I left or was treated. They are understand and caring. They allways work a flexible appointment schedule for me, do to at times i can't drive to my appointment do to my anxiety or other symptoms.  Thank you Dr. Smoot, Luis, & receptionists. You are all wonderful.
God Bless.< /text>

Dr. Smoot was very kind and gave me lots of good information. The only reason I didn't continue with his office was that he didn't accept my insurance company. Hopefully in the future he will accept MCSIG  Bluecross. Thanks!</Text>

I have been a patient of Dr. Smoot's since Nov 2017, and I have learned more about what my body goes through on a daily basis and how to properly care for myself in order to feel better and to heal. Dr. Smoot teaches patients about proper desk/computer positions and also about mattress and pillows for a better nights sleep. I would not have thought about how these small changes have made a huge difference in how my body feels. When I enter Dr. Smoot's office I am always greeted by a warm and friendly person. My adjustments have made a tremendous difference in my neck and spine, not to mention my flexibility in my workouts.  Also, Dr. Smoot always takes time to ask how I am feeling and helps with the issues I may be having. I never leave without having my concerns addressed.  I recommend that everyone should give Dr. Smoot and his staff the opportunity to help you feel your best.< /Text>

<Review>I have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Brian Smoot for over four years.
I am very impressed with Dr. Smoot’s consideration, knowledge, passion and desire to help.  Dr. Smoot has treated me for various, sports related, back and arm pain. Dr. Smoot’s diagnosis and treatment has been extremely helpful in relieving me of my pain and completely resolving my issues.
For example
I am a competitive tennis player and I was experiencing severe pain in my mid-spine. I called Dr. Smoot and he made room in his busy schedule to take me in right away.  After adjusting my back by the end of the day my pain was greatly reduced and completely disappeared in a few days.   I can now play tennis and golf on a daily basis without pain.  He was able to resolve my problem without drugs or surgery. I get adjusted on a weekly basics and my tennis coach has noticed a huge improvement in my footwork and my game.
Dr. Smoot focuses living a pain free lifestyle, not just resolving your symptoms.
I have nothing but admiration and respect for Dr. Brian Smoot< /Review>< name>

I have been a patient of Dr. Smoot for several months now.  When I first came to visit him, I was suffering from severe hip pain.  Immediately, Dr. Smoot diagnosed my hips as out of balance.  He also discovered that there were issues with my neck that were causing my headaches (I had summed the headaches up to allergies).
As a very active athlete, I feared a diagnosis that would cause me to give up my workouts and rest.  Thankfully, Dr. Smoot, who is also an athlete, assured me that I wouldn't have to miss any workouts!
Fast-forward several months and I am experiencing an immense improvement!  Dr. Smoot has enabled me to continue running and training for Reebok Spartan races, which are extremely challenging and rough on the body.  I am extremely grateful for all his work and so glad I took him up on a consultation.  Dr. Smoot is an amazing chiropractor and a true professional, who realizes the necessity for and the benefits of an active lifestyle.  With his help, I was able to complete two Spartan races (both of which he competed in as well)!!  Also, I will be running in the Big Sur half-marathon in two weeks!!
I highly recommend Dr. Smoot to anyone suffering from unnecessary pain.  You won't be disappointed.< /text>

<review>Ever wake up with muscle spasms and think, "OMG...who do I call for immediate help!?"  Dr. Smoot is your answer.  Yesterday I woke up at 4am with excruciating pain in my shoulder. I waited until 8am to call Dr. Smoot, and I was in his office in less than an hour. I was a consistent patient of his about 5 years ago with a roller derby injury, and under his care, was able to fully heal---but I hadn't been back to his office since then. I had a big gala to go to yesterday and literally could not turn my head or lift my arm. Dr. Smoot's adjustment was completely necessary, and got my mobility back to normal so I didn't look like a zombie with a cricked neck and a hunched shoulder at a black tie event. Go see him. I'm telling you---you'll feel SO. MUCH. BETTER.</review>< Pics>

I brought my 8 year old son in to see Dr. Smoot because he had been complaining of pain in his left hip area for almost two weeks.  He's all boy, full of energy and constantly moving.  From racing motorcycles, to jumping ramps on his bike.  He bounces back fairly quickly after a tumble.  So it was unlike him to complain of pain continually in the same area.  When I brought him in for a consultation, Dr. Smoot was very informative and expained everything to my son in a way he would understand.  After his exam and x-rays, he started recieving chiropractic care, and literally after his first treatment he was feeling better and the pain was gone!  He looks forward to his adjustments, and asks me when he's going to see "his" chiropractor!  I definitely believe in chiropractic care, and recommend Dr. Smoot to anyone in need of it!  He is humble and gentle, and nothing but professional!< /Text>

<Review>Dr. Smoot and his staff are definitely something special, they have impacted my life as well as my disabled son's life for the best.
I had major lower back pain,
constant  and painful TMJ and I also quit running years ago due to shin splints. After attending a class hosted by Dr. Smoot I was encouraged to make regular chiropractic care, nutrition and exercise all part of my life. After getting regularly adjusted by Dr. Smoot my lower back pain has completely vanished!!! I'm a runner again and the healthiest I have ever been, my TMJ I've had for over 6 years is no longer bothering me at all! my son's seizures decreased and he's a lot more comfortable every day.. I can't thank Dr.Smoot enough!
He takes the time to get to know you, he's very patient and genuinely cares about his patients ..  his staff is amazing also ! They really treat you like a family and not just another number, they truly go above and beyond there titles !!< /Review>< date>

<Text>Total scam artist. The numerous posters of satisfied patients around the office should have been the first clue. I'm sure they are probably mostly workers comp cases that the patient doesn't have to pay. I went to this office after they were gracious enough to give me a same day appointment. The receptionist are very nice. The reception area has furniture that could use a little upholstery cleaning, but no big deal. After 30 minutes of watching  a video and listening to Dr Smoot talk about himself (another red flag), I should have left. However, he said they were going to 'assess' me and come up with a treatment plan for $220. I assumed this meant I was to be treated. That was not the case. I left $220 shorter with no treatment. They said they would see me the next day and the receptionist said I would be treated then and that would not cost anything. Not true. Day 2: Another video and 30 minutes of Smoot talking about chiropractic theory and then another receptionist coming in saying my 'treatment plan' would cost about $2300 and require about 40 visits over a few months. So let's rewind, I have now had 2 visits, no treatment, paid $220, and they are asking me upfront for another $2300 for a future treatment plan!!!! I expressed my frustration at the fact that I didn't want anything other than an adjustment when I came in the first time. If they could not have provided that for $220 I would have left.They wanted an additional $65 to receive treatment!!!! I also expressed my discontent about the plan as it would be impossible for ANYONE to show up to any doctor's office 44 times over a 13 weeks. Especially for something as routine as chiro care. Don't believe the hype about this guy. Something else is going on here and I've seen one other chiropractor that ran this scam (where they want this big work up and for you to agree to dozens of treatments you're not likely going to be able to make if you're a normal person with a job). I have received chiro care for over 20 years and honestly have rarely ever had issue with any provider. But this guy is not what he seems. About me: I have worked in hospital healthcare for 8 years, have a master's degree, and would never post a bad review unless I felt it was warranted. I definitely plan on complaining to whatever board regulates chiropractors in this state.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

<text>While I've loved Dos Coyotes for 30 years, this one is lacking in quality control. About every other time we're there the salsa/guac in our burritos is 60% jalapenos and the person cutting them didn't try very hard. Size and fill of burritos is also hit and miss.<//text>< Pictures>

It's quarantine and their entrance was very spaced out and easy to understand. I was in a mood and only wanted greasy taco truck! But I'd heard great things about DC so walked in. A young lady with blue eyes was totally ready to assist in any way and was really on top of all the menu items. She had a great demeanor for customer service. I almost wanted to buy their food just because she was so accommodating. I'd recommend this place for groups or parents with picky eaters, as the employee explained that it's more fresh-mex.< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

We just moved to Natomas from San Diego and were craving some good Mexican food last night. Dos Coyotes did not disappoint!

I had the cheese enchilada & chicken taco plate. The sauce on the enchilada was flavorful and rich - a perfect compliment to the cheesy goodness within. I opted for a crispy taco and it was not greasy (like some can be), but light, with a definite home made taste. An excellent meal, and the staff were super friendly and welcoming to us as new neighbors. I recommend it!<//text>

Please try the paella burrito and you must double the catch.

I love the additional mahi mahi in the burrito.   I mix it up by occasionally getting a bowl instead of the burrito.

Friendly, helpful staff. Clean and fresh decor. Food was prepared as ordered, fresh, hot and tasty.  They do have gluten free options. My one slight complaint is the noise level. This is a place I recommend and will return.</review>

Honestly quality food, barely finished the burrito and I have a huge appetite. Really great service, the food came out super fast and it's like a mix between an actual restaurant and fast food! Definitely will come again!< /text>

This restaurant was clean and comfortable. Our host, Cole was friendly and efficient and he makes delicious margaritas, too. We had the Gumbo and Southwestern pulled pork burrito with excellent guacamole and chips. The general manager, Carlos checked on us and we all had a great visit with him. Looking forward to bringing the family of nine back to dine again at Dos Coyotes!! 👍< /Review>

<review>Dos Coyotes Border Cafe on Del Paso Road is amazing! Its produce is fresh and their burritos are spot-on! Everyone loves it and I truly enjoy going there with my family. We only go there 2-3 times a year but every time is special! (Big thank you to the people who work there)<//review>< time>

Same menu as the other Dos locations.  Maybe it was just because it was a Sunday night but this was our first time at this location and it needed some help.  Service was very slow and not that many customers there.  Food was not as nice looking as the preparation we usually see at the Davis location.  The steak on my burrito and our son's nachos had a very strange aftertaste to it.  My wife enjoyed her tacos but overall the meal was just off.< /Text>

<review>My husband and I went for dinner tonight. First timers and we had a wonderful experience. Super clean and great staff. I had the shrimp tacos with some amazing mango sause and my husband had the southwest burrito. They have a huge chips and salsa bar. The only bad thing I have to say was my rice was a little hard, but that wont stop us from coming back. Great food.</review>< userid>

I've been going to Dos Coyotes ever since I was little. They are all amazing Tex Mex. Every branch I've gone to I am happy with their service and food quality. Good big portions and the fancy soda machine! I have family from Reno and they always have to get their Dos!< /text>

Three adults for a late lunch. It was very quiet inside and we were promptly greeted. Two specials were ordered, Quesadilla Margherita and Rocket Tacos. The tacos were a first time for me and were excellent! The contrast of the crunchy arugula and soft pickled onions on top of the spicy chicken fajita, great texture and great flavor. I think this site just recently opened, but the food is as good as the well-established sites in Davis where I frequent more often.< /Text>

Dos is one of my favorite places to eat.  You can always find something and they are constantly changing their menu and season specials - so you don't have to stick in your restaurant rut!  This location did not disappoint - and the new decor is awesome.  Love the vibe.</review>

I may be biased but I love this location.  Not only is the food great, it was quick and reasonably priced.  I also really loved the look a feel of the place.  Our party was big and it was easy to accommodate the group by expanding tables without burdening the restaurant.   I also really appreciated the service as several times the team members checked in on us.  In fact one of the team members i believe it was Tatianna asked if she could snap a photo of my family and the best surprise was she left the Polaroid for us.  Well done Dos, I will be back, many times!!!! :)< /text>

Made a phone order for two paella burritos and was told it would take 15 minutes. When I got there I paid for my order and waited. People came and left, a pair of people came in and ordered at the counter and received their food and completed their meal and left before I was told that they were out of paella rice. I got my money refunded and was offered a rice substitution for food I no longer wanted. 45 minute wait for a called in order that still wasn't completed. Never had this issue at the other Dos locations that I've been to. Wont be back.< /text>

This office is closed, we tried calling a few days prior and the phone was disconnected, apparently the office has been closed since January of 2019 when the FBI came in and arrested everyone in the office for fraud, stealing passports and reselling them, we came today Monday Jan 13th 2020 and found all this out. The only other consulate is Washington DC, I heard you can file a complaint through your local city hall on your passport issues but I am not 100% on that. Best of luck but don’t try to come to SF consulate bc it is PERMANENTLY CLOSED!!!!<//Text>

<Review>Great experience, the people at the Venezuelan consulate were fantastic. As soon as we arrived I was greeted and help get everything square away to renew my passport. Even thought there were technical difficulties the staff keep us informed about the progress and were diligently working to fix it. Is nice for a change to be in a public office were the staff truly cares about the people in attendance.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Rude if you actually manage to talk to someone. Civil service is not a part of the Maduro Regime's lingo. everyone there is just cruising and supporting the criminal regime.
I requested and paid for my passport over a year ago. I have not received word nor managed to get in touch with someone since the phone number is not active.
Venezuelan consulate is Ali Baba's cave and there are well over 40 thieves.<//Review>< Name>

The consulate is closed !!!!   I went there November 15th 2016 for my passport renewal appointment. There is a sign that says the Consulate is closed until further notice.   Terrible news for us Venezuelans in the region trying to renew the passport to go see our families back in Venezuela ..

Update, I sent an email to the Consulate and I received an auto-reply message stating that the office is going to be closed until December 01 ,and that they are going to reschedule the appointments beginning January 2017</Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) They never answer the phone. It is not clear if they are serving the community. Months ago we are trying to communicate to renew a passport. Not even the website seems updated.

(Translated by Google) A garbage of service like the government garbage that our country has today. My passport was stolen and they could not solve it because the system shows that "I do not have a passport" or that "I am currently in process" because I had requested the extension. The consul told me that it was up to me to load the cancellation on the SAIME page and DOES NOT UNDERSTAND that the SAIME page is GARBAGE and DOES NOT LOAD. They stole $ 200 from me to do NOTHING and I wasted my time and money coming from LA. Chavista garbage!

(Original)
Una basura de servicio al igual que la basura de Gobierno que tiene nuestro país actualmente. Mi pasaporte fue robado y no pudieron solucionarme porque en el sistema aparece que “no poseo pasaporte” o que “estoy en un trámite actualmente” porque había solicitado la prórroga. El cónsul me dijo que dependía de mi, de cargar en la página del SAIME la anulación y NO ENTIENDE que la página del SAIME es BASURA y NO CARGA. Me robaron 200$ para no hacer NADA y perdí mi tiempo y mi dinero viniendo desde LA. Basura chavista!<//Text>

(Translated by Google) On September 7, 2016, I presented myself for my appointment to request a new passport. Today is November and not even any status I have received from SAIME. The new office looks like a doctor's office. The waiting room is small. The staff look like zombies. Even the official who took me the precautions, spoke covering his mouth with his left hand and wrote with his right. Nothing professional his attitude. There was a Chinese without speaking any of our language renewing his Venezuelan passport, which expires in 2017? I'm not going to go to politics, but it seemed very strange. In October, I contacted the Consulate to see if they had any status of the diplomatic bag that they receive once a month with their passports. Apparently there are no humans who answer my email, everything is a general format. There is no way to call either and if I do they send me prisoner? I just want my passport, I hope it will arrive one day. Sorry for the accents, but my keyboard was in English.

(Original)
El 07 de Septiembre del 2016 me presente para mi cita para solicitar un nuevo pasaporte.  Hoy es Noviembre y ni siquiera ningun estatus he recibido de SAIME.  La oficina nueva parece un consultorio medico.  La sala de espera es pequeña.  El personal parecen zombies.  Inclusive el funcionario que me tomo los recaudos, hablaba tapandose la boca con la mano izquierda y escribia con la derecha. Nada profesional su actitud.  Habia un Chino sin hablar nada de nuestro idioma renovando su pasaporte Venezolano, el cual se vencia en el 2017?  No voy a irme a lo politico, pero me parecio muy raro.  En Octubre, me comunique con el Consulado a ver si tenian algun estatus de la valija diplomatica que reciben una vez al mes con los pasaportes.  Al parecer no hay humanos que contesten mi correo electronico, todo es un formato general. No hay manera de llamar tampoco y si lo hago me mandan preso?  Solo quiero mi pasaporte, espero que llegue algun dia. Perdonen los acentos, pero mi teclado estaba en Inglés.< /text>

<review>(Translated by Google) I have carried out a number of operations and bureaucratic activities and all of them have worked out very well so far, punctual people, quick and effective procedures, the staff was cordial, and very helpful, the documents arrived on time without errors, Really very good service, very little staff for the amount and volume of work they have. That is the Venezuela we want.

I have done a countless operations and bureaucratic activities with them, and my experience so far has been very well, they are on time at work, fast and effective, the staff was friendly and very helpful, the documents came to me on time without errors , really good service. The only problem is that for the amount of work they are low on staff. This is the Venezuela all of us we want.

<review>I gave 5 stars because food selection was really good although none that amazing. I really went here because I enjoy seeing the revolving sushi, and the belt system entertains my child. Would recommend trying it at least once, if your at all into technology. Service was also very great!<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNAHmUhTgojtuWW8Yz2YLUuDmJAhRZ_ku46CTRw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPJXJcdcFdQvdA88AZ78PUMModUsqvLwxzMuPlF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOkPRYf6v294GrfigmobIVty7_scygIrPblwLJE=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMw1aUvgkh9jhsHJK-1U5X-fF1EFbf1TI3wKtkO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOa1nxO4tS1diCkJyM8u7znpGK5JBqs2w76xGfo=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP64yhbbkHz1SWd1h1lqB74tWooeGmGcTa0nZRU=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNldROvDoXT6M4R7gOdTLApQz7uWUIlCd1cyjA9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAdbSuC28lctyt5fcRxXRNqRaq3G1JFdY9OjAX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipND3CXrfWmfwCUxQL5Ua0h7Lb3f-mX_U4QiYUor=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPjTZsftrh9DYTT4nLqPM-T3oZ2MicNS-Ah9WsV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

<Review>I called to make sure dine in was available and to check wait times... the gal on the phone was super nice and helpful! When we got there we were greeted, escorted to a table and the hostess kindly explained how everything worked. She let the kids practice grabbing the plate and explained the menu. The food and dessert is delicious! The kids loved the experience- watching the food pass by was fun!!! We will definitely be back!</Review><Date>1622411291123</Date><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x80dd27a1d80dbd25:0x20244504620a6949<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Amazing experience! The staff was great and the food was amazing. This was our first time here and something we've wanted to do on our bucket list. So happy we stopped by when we go to California again we'd love to stop by again!< /Text>

Very good quality sushi. They even have toro which is pretty hard to find at most sushi places.

You are billed a flat rate per plate and you push it through a chute and it tallies the total bill.

They have some kind of point system but it relies on Google pay and leaving your credit card on file which I'm not trusting that part. Very good experience.

Parking can be difficult as well, the area itself is a traffic nightmare.<//Text>

We went to the restaurant late afternoon and found most of the plates on the conveyer empty, which I guess kind of makes sense but there were a good 20 ppl in the restaurant and I'd imagine more plates should have been available. We ended up ordering more items from the screen menu as opposed to what was readily available, and those orders were really great! Just wish the conveyer belt had more items on it!</Review>

Great new addition to the area. Kura Sushi is one of my favorite revolving sushi places because of their wide selection and service style.<//review>

We moved to Austin Texas for awhile and they had a Kura with bad quality. The only one I ever tried was the one in Little Tokyo prior which always has long lines but is amazing quality. This location is exactly that just with shorter lines. (Atleast when I went at 7pm) This is the best quality you can get and I loved all the sushi pieces I tried. Will most definitely come back and tell my friends! Yummy udon and miso soup as well!</Review>

<Review>This place is super fun, sushi rotates around your tables and you grab what you want as it passes by. You can also place special orders and it'll zoom right to you! We spent $65 for just 2 of us after clearing 20 plates and 1 plate of strawberry mochi. A typical plate has 2-3 pieces of sushi on them and average about $2.80 per plate but can go up to $4.20 for special orders.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>Neat atmosphere, cool technology regarding the process of ordering food via tablet and receiving food on a conveyor belt, putting used plates away with the tablet keeping track of how many you have consumed, cute free gift for groups who order more than 15 plates. The service was good, friendly and the food tasted great. Noodles were kind of small in portions, so I would recommend coming when you are only half hungry so you don't have to worry about spending as much money.  We came on a weeknight where it wasn't busy at all, so I am not sure how different our experience would have been had we went on a weekend instead.</Review>< Pics>

Cool atmosphere with a sushi conveyor belt. Service is good and people are nice. Sushi is not so good. Rice breaks apart and so does the sushi. Taste isn't the best and it seems they are going for quantity over quality.</Review>

Solid conveyer belt sushi bar.  Reasonable food and service for the price.  Definitely a good place to go for a quick bite of sushi.  The ability to special order off the digital screen at the table is also good.  Will go back again.<//text>

Took my dad here for the 1st time and he loved it. It was amazing how we were able to get in and out of there within less than 30 minutes since most of sushi we wanted were already made to eat. The revolving line with different sushi made it easy to grab multiple choices within seconds of each other. They also have udon and lunch box options here which we didnt get to this time but will be back later to try. We'll definitely come back soon.< /Review>

We ended up ordering more items from the screen menu as opposed to what was readily available, and those orders were really great! Just wish the conveyer belt had more items on it!< /text>< Pics>

<text>It is only good for the price not the best sushi place in town yet. I do not like the sushi rice as it is too easy breaking up in half with chopsticks. And I have been using chopsticks for 30 years now. Service and servers are okay. I do not know what I tip them for. They only get the drinks and the checks, that's all. The belt already do the serving job for them. Don't feel bad if you do not tip them enough.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<review>This is the biggest Kura ever!! It’s brand new so everything is clean & pretty nice looking. Food is quick when ordering from the digital menu. The conveyor belt can be pretty empty sometimes. They recently got taiyaki with red bean and it’s such a perfect end to sushi!!! You get a toy after your fifteenth plate, just like other Kuras< /review>< pics>

<time>1580187425095< /time><Rating>3<//Rating><Review>I will preface that I visited for dinner about an hour before closing. The sushi was decent for the price. Most plates of nigiri are $2.60 a plate for two pieces. Some are one piece. Being able to drop your plates into a slot in front of you so you don't have a huge pile is great. The gatchapon system is fun but the items are more for kids, though this isn't a knock at them, more just informative for guests who do bring children. This places offers both revolving and and conveyor belt, which some items came at pretty fast. The dining room wasn't all that busy but service was very poor. I had to pour my own water twice. Waiting several times for service for at least 5 minutes with no one coming by, they only came back to my spot when I wanted to close out my check.

Not a bad place but not great service.< /Review>< pics>

This location is convenient and I never have to wait in line. I'll be honest and say that I have had better sushi. And of the Kura restaurant locations, this one does not compared to some of the others. I think the one in Irvine is better. Some of the items that I like here are the garlic shrimp, the shrimp udon, and inari.</text>

<text>I paid $2.60 for one piece of Toro (fatty cut of tuna belly) and I'm fine with that. The Tonkotsu Ramen was surprisingly good quality, with a solid selection of options off the conveyor belt (never had conch meat before). For what I paid, I definitely felt like I got my money's worth.<//text>< Pictures>

Not careful at all. here is the list of things they broke: two large platters, a dining room chair, a bedroom side table, a cat tree, a glass table top for a bistro table. Some of the boxes were packed terrible (all the stuff just dumped in a box, and others had excessive amounts of paper. one box was crushed. they left part of my surround system in the truck, only to first deny they still had it, and then brought it back weeks later. They poorly assembled a bed and I had to tighten every bolt myself. they paid little attention to where boxes were supposed to go and I had to pay someone to move a bunch of stuff around that was in the wrong spot. terrible experience during an already stressful time. they rushed me through the contract and failed to point out that they would only reimburse damages by weight which has nothing to do with replacement cost. but it's not even about the $$, I would have preferred to have someone treat my belongings with more care. I share this review so that it doesn't happen to someone else.< /Review>

Would give them six stars if I could. Jose and his team were super careful in getting the furniture ready to move and getting it in place at my new home. I couldn't find a single scratch or ding on anything. And no damage to anything that I had packed either. I recommend this company without any reservations.</text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Text>Moving out of the area for the first time in 33 years, we had too much stuff to move ourselves.  We received a reasonable quote from Kevin:  other moving companies quoted a lot less, but those didn't seem realistic.  Also, the service was for one dedicated truck that would deliver our belongings to our new residence 8 hours away the next day. On the move day, Enrique, Juan, and 2 other fantastic employees arrived on time and carefully and efficiently wrapped the furniture and loaded our 80+ boxes on the truck.  While it took us 30 minutes to move boxes into a staging area, they moved the same number of boxes onto the truck in less than 10!  Our new residence has stairs, and the team swiftly moved all the boxes and furniture into their new locations, being careful to lay down mats on the wood floors and plastic sheets on the carpeting to prevent any damage.  I appreciated their responsiveness, positive attitude and professionalism, and whole heartedly recommend them for your next move.</Text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

They were prompt and came in like a squat team, totally focused and determined to do the job. It was great! They were very careful with some delicate pieces and reassembled everything after it was in. This is my first time using a moving company and I only needed furniture and plants moved. I called a few places and Careful movers is competitive with pricing. They charged me by the hour and I figured the cost would go over my original quote and it did, considerably, so I would get someone to come out for a more accurate quote next time. It was worth not having to deal with the headache of moving furniture though.< /review>

My wife and I hired Careful Movers three times: once to unload our moving truck when we moved to California, a second time when we moved from one city to another city in California, and a third time when we moved out of California.

I own a 113-yr-old Steinway piano that is notoriously difficult to move (even compared with other pianos). It has a cast-iron frame and the weight distribution is uneven, both top to bottom and front to back. It also has a rounded bottom, which makes it severely difficult to balance while rolling it on a dolly. This is the only moving company which has been able to move this piano with ease. One of the Careful Movers, Enrique, figured out a way to balance the piano on the dolly (using the wheel cups as wedges), and three or four different professional piano movers we had used before him could not figure out how to do this. While previous movers struggled and cursed trying to move it, and constantly had to keep a man or two to hold the piano up, the Careful Movers crew was able to roll it on a dolly as if it was just any old piano. Enrique and his crew fit the piano into a room in our new place that I honestly did not think would be a possibility. I am a little worried that the next moving company we hire (since we are no longer near Careful Movers) will not be as good and won't be able to get it out.

There are a few other items we own that were on the difficult side for normal professional moving companies to deal with. Nothing terribly unusual (aside from the piano), but just normal difficult stuff. I think the difference with Careful Movers is that they just look at each piece as a puzzle to solve and come up with a creative way to handle it, and they share their solution with you so that you can have an easier move the next time. That alone is worth something.

The quoted estimate was the same as actual cost of each move (no hidden costs). Anthony and his team were great about communicating with me in advance of the move and even fulfilled my request to have the same crew that had moved us before (I only requested this because of the piano), though he was also very clear with me that he couldn't guarantee the same crew.

Additionally, they have always been friendly and professional, and this time around were COVID-safe (wearing masks at all times, even though they are doing heavy lifting. There were no scratches or dents in any of our possessions. They always show up on time and are down to business right away.

I would recommend these guys to anyone in the the SF Bay area whether you're moving to or away. Especially if you have a piano!<//Text>

The Careful sales team were super responsive, and helpful.  Their pricing was competitive for both moving and long term storage.  We had some misunderstandings but Kevin and Anthony were genuinely interested in listening to & accommodating our needs/concerns.

Their packing & moving crew were punctual, arriving on the dot as agreed.  they did a great job, and under time/budget.

The Careful Movers team was by far the most 'service oriented' and customer focused one we spoke to (out of 8-10 companies).  You can trust that these guys will do the right thing.</review>

They were efficient and I never had to repeat any placement/packing request. All my items arrived safely with no damage, and they took apart and rebuilt several pieces of furniture quickly. They were not the cheapest option I looked at, but I am glad I went with them as they are of higher quality than most services I have used for my past moving experiences. I will definitely use them again!<//review></record>

Careful Movers were fantastic, I had a wonderful experience from start to finish. The booking process was smooth and quick. The gentlemen who came to move everything were professional, friendly and courteous. I’ve had difficult moving experiences before, but this company is great. Definitely recommend!!< /Text>

I moved from Menlo to Pacifica right before the holidays (always a stressful time for everyone). Careful Movers made my move a breeze. The guys arrived on time, took extra care with my items and were SO FAST. They moved me out of my old one-bed apartment and into my new one in about 2.5 hours. The team was friendly, professional and fun. Highly recommend!</Review>

< Review>
Thumbs up on the easiest move I've ever had! We moved from a 1-BR on the Peninsula to the East Bay -- done in about 4.5 hours. The team at Careful Movers could not have been better. I got a call a couple of days before the move (even on the weekend!) to make sure all the details were worked out. They arrived on time, did a careful and fast job of disassembling/reassembling the bed and crib for our baby (such a relief for us), and moved everything very quickly. I would be very happy to use them again.< /Review>

Great & seamless move with careful movers. Finished even a bit ahead of the estimated time. Two minor things - there is a 3% credit card fee which they didn't warn us about in advance, and 1 our chair cover got a bit dirty. But not a big deal, overall a great experience!</Text>

<text>When I called they were super helpful in helping me plan. They called me in advance to remind me and talk about options (if I needed boxes or packing help). They showed up on time. The crew was very courteous and gentle with my stuff. I’m very happy with the value and will use them for sure for future moves.</text>< pics>

Very thorough, polite and helpful service.  They did a careful job of packing china and glassware, as well as a range of miscellaneous stuff.  Some special constraints on my move were handled well.  This experience suggests that if high-quality service is what you want (and are willing to pay for), Careful Movers are a good source.<//review>

<Review>From first point of contact with Careful Movers
to the last box they moved for us, we were impressed with the services we received.   Anthony, the rep who assisted us with our reservation, was communicative and helpful in getting us our quote.  Enrique and his team were amazing in moving us from our 3bd apartment to a 2-story home.  They moved quickly, worked efficiently, and took such great care of our belongings.  All the guys on the crew were friendly, and just made the entire experience easy.  I would highly recommend Enrique and his crew and Careful Movers to anyone looking to move.  Thank you!<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>{'time': 1592868048576, 'text': 'Thank you Annalyn!'}<//resp>< gmapID>

<text>They are very careful with fragile stuff but they broke a spoon and TAPED it. The amount of extra paper they used is ridiculous and it fills 3 medium size boxes. I paid for appliances disconnect and reconnect but they didn't reconnect, that wasn't a nice surprise. They also lost a brand new sous vide. I have them extra tip to get rid of some old shelves and they left one behind a door. They also didn't account for the fridge, garden stuff and one other furniture so it at the end it wouldn't fit, they had to come back and charged me more. They also round up, a lot, on they worked hours and then they try to be nice at compensating the extra hour value but in the end they charged me total one and a half extra hours. They were also half hour late on the first day (packing).
They were all very friendly so two stars.</text>< rating>

We used Careful Movers for a large move last week and the experience was excellent.  We filled their largest truck completely full, so there was a lot to move, but they were fast, courteous, and very professional.  They sent a crew of 4 people (where other companies have only quoted us for 3), and finished the job by the early afternoon, rather than grinding through until late in the evening. We really appreciated both how quickly they were able to get the job done and how thoroughly they wrapped and protected every piece of furniture and moved 2 large flat-screen TVs that we no longer have the original packaging for.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>From the moment I spoke with Anthony at their HQ, my experience has been top notch.  Careful Movers was responsive and friendly and took a lot of stress out of the moving process.  5 crew members showed up right on time on move day and they tackled the whole lot of our belongings with professionalism and care.  Ismael, Gilberto, Jose, Riley, and (oh no, I forgot the other crew member's name) were simply amazing and super hard workers!  If you are wondering how safe they were in these COVID times, Careful Movers assured me they have measures in place around symptoms (workers may not report to work if they have any symptoms).  Our 5 member crew showed up in gloves and masks (which must have been very hard to work in but they didn't blink an eye about it).  I had a bottle of hand sanitizer out and I know they used it from time to time as well.  All in all - great experience.  Would totally recommend Careful Movers!</Review><Date>1593713154529<//Date><Pictures>None<//Pictures><gmapID>0x808f98aabba776b9:0x696d6a1a6a69a4bb</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Overpriced and inefficient team work. Took way longer than it should have been. I guess because they charge by the hours. Over $4,000 to move a few blocks.

He followed up and ask me how they can improve. It was a good follow up. Moving their reviews from 1 star to 4 stars. Thanks!</text>

I stopped by here with a pre-vegan who hadn't the sense to realize a vegan (an ethical stance that entirely rejects human exploitation of other species of animals) like me has *no* interest in watching any other person eat the "products" of animals who were hurt and also killed for the most trivial reason. The lady working here was kind enough to disclose that there is, in fact, nothing on the menu that a vegan would eat. I've assigned 3 of 5 stars for her honesty--in order to not terribly diminish the average score for this establishment. However, I cannot believe I would return here, for any other occasion.< /Review>

Avoid. Unless you're starving. Big disappointment,many taco places have this old beans and meat taste. Skip this place. Tacos jaliciense are way better.</text>

I needed a rose gold ring sized. I called and got the info I needed. Went in the very next day and Steve did it in a few minutes. Came out like it was made that way, there's no way to tell what he even did besides it fits now. It looks flawless. I've been here before for watch batteries etc... and Steve is always great. If you need a jeweler, this is the spot. Also, there's a nice selection of rings (all kinds), pearls, earrings, necklaces, and loose gems for mounting to look at while you wait. 🤙< /Review>

<Text>Steve has been amazing since two years ago when i needed my engagement ring milgrain fixed to now when i needed a replacement diamond in my wedding ring i bought from an etsy seller. I was a starving nursing student when i got married and could only afford a weaker material/ setting for my band from an etsy seller.  The ring came too big and poorly made.  As a nurse, I'm very involved with my hands and donning gloves and i inevitably knocked a diamond out. Steve custom designed my new bevel wedding band to house my diamonds so i don't lose anymore and continue wearing medical gloves without worry. His craftsmanship speaks for itself. My new ring is the bevel inlay.  He offers special payment plans,  lay away, he'll work within your budget to make sure you're happy.  This place is a win.</Text>< Resp>

<Text>I went yesterday to TQ Jewelry because of good reviews. The jeweler (his name Steve) resized my wife’s two rings.  He did very, very good job.  Now, because of the marvelous work he done it, today I brought to him more staff to work on it (rings to be resized, watches for batteries to be changed and some jewelry to be professionally cleaned). He done it all beautify and at very reasonable price. Steve seems to be very knowledgeable, professional and nice guy. I would recommend him to anyone.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Steve is very kind and caring to your jewelry needs❤Me and my husband visited his location 3x now and he has fully gained our trust. As soon as you walk in you are greeted with a warm welcome and he truly thanks you for your business. It's nice to find trustworthy people that truly care and are not trying to take advantage of your wallet.</review>

<review>I went to this jeweler because of good reviews and was close by to where I was going to be. Steve explains everything he is going to do. He encouraged to watch the screen on the monitor to see how he does it. I got my wedding rings resized and reshaped. He did a terrific job! Looks perfect and sparkly. Going back again to get my husband’s ring done as well.</review>< Pictures>

This is the finest repair shop I've ever experienced. My daughter went in to the jewelry store to have her boyfriend bracelet fix. While we were there I had him look at my ring to see if he could repair my birthstone. Needless to say Steve repaired my daughter's boyfriends bracelet, and he repaired my ring. He  workmanship is second to none. He has a very special skill set when it comes to quality and craftsmanship. If you are looking for excellent & quality service, along with a friendly atmosphere, look no further.
If you are need of jewelry repair, give Steve a chance, you'll be glad you did.<//Text>

This tiny place is a gem. The jeweler is super friendly and informative and the prices seem to be reasonable.  We were only there for an estimate on watch repair and a battery but we will definitely take our business there.<//review>

I took my 18 carat gold rolex with a 18 carat band into TQ JEWELERS and met STEVE the owner . he fixed my band while I stood there and explained what he was doing. he is amazing, a true professional.when I need jewelry repaired, or if I need custom made jewelry, STEVE is the one I will go to. I'm not easily impressed but STEVE really impressed me, great jeweler and great guy< /Text>

Steve was great and did great work on my ring. He custom made me 2 wedding bands for my ring. It came out beautifully. He's taken care of sizing and fixing other jewelry for me in the past, and I've always been pleased.</Text>

The best quality work!!! Steve Quach is Amazing at cleaning, and resizing jewelry. The quality of work is amazing everything looked brand new. I took my grandmother's rings/ promise ring to be cleaned, resizing and Rhodium Plating. He handled the rings with care. Also, fixed two  necklaces for me. I will be returning again. Thank you so much.</review>

So for our Anniversary i got it refurbished! It literally is a 15 year old ring that has been taken through the ringer! See the pictures. This ring is day and night different. He saw that the diamonds in the ring were smaller than the hole the diamond sat in and he replaced it with diamonds that fix the hole! He pays very close attention to detail!!!!!! And he makes amazing jewelry!<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I had a ring resized here. The jeweler was very clear about what had to be done to resize my ring because of the twisty style. He did a great job!! He was very fast and performed great work. I usually drive to the LA Jewelry district to have all of my jewelry repaired, but from now on I am going to bring my jewelry to TQ Jewelers.</Review>

I came into TQ jewlers with my girlfriend to get her promise ring re sized from a size 6 to 8 1/2, Upon entering we were greeted warmly by Steve. He was able to size her finger and re size the ring the same day, he also polished it and cleaned it up beautifully all at a very reasonable price. I can't thank TQ jewellers enough and greatly appreciate the help and customer service I received and will definitely recommend them to anyone looking for or needing help with jewelry</review>

(Translated by Google) It relaxes me and you need to be alone because I can not forget Amy mother and I get angry because the owners of the house where she died from carbon monoxide. they do not solve the problem but if they increase the income

(Original)
Me relaja ay veses nesesitas estar sólo porque no puedo olvidar Amy madre y me enojo porque los dueños de la casa donde murió por monóxido de carbono. no solusionan el problema pero si aumentan la renta<//Text>

Good German beer selection. The food is tasty but I wouldn’t go there strictly for the food. Nice spot to drink and get snacks. Great ordering system< /Text>

<rating>4<//rating><Text>Last Saturday I came here for the second time and it was the proof/reaffirmation that it is a good place to eat. (breakfast, lunch, or dinner).

Its dining area is cozy, spacious, and perfect for relaxing, enjoying your food, and the street view. I had the famous Turkish Breakfast (light, varied, and full of flavors that combined are very enjoyable), my friend ordered something "safe" and something traditional: traditional beef burger & gyro pita. He was very happy with both options (meat with good seasoning/taste and not greasy) and of course a traditional beer (he was really happy with the combination of food and beer).

The staff is friendly and always looking if you need something, and ready to clean/disinfect the areas that are vacated to prepare them for the next people.

Its menu is very varied and extensive, which will give you the opportunity to go more than once and enjoy all its options (and its desserts!)

Bonus point: the location, it gives you the opportunity to walk -after eating (and not feeling so guilty about the dessert you ordered) through the whole Castro street and enjoy the atmosphere of "the streets closed to cars".< /Text>< pics>

Came here on a Sunday morning and got the special Susec Menemen with the Turkey sausage and the peppers and pita! This place has a ton of outdoor seating and you get served relatively quickly I really enjoyed that they also had Exploding Kittens which I played before my food came. The pita was super flakey and tasty and the tomato flavor was really great and savory so the whole Turkish breakfast dish stood out a lot. Would come again.</Text>

I'd give this 3.5 stars, but round up to 4.

This is a really cute, family owned, small Turkish spot. They have all kinds of traditional pastries and meals. I got the Turkish breakfast, which looked incredible. It looked a bit better than it tasted, and it was pricy for what it was (sliced tomato, cucumber, salami, and an egg) but the bread was fresh baked and food was satisfying.

I'd probably try it again.<//Review>

Wonderful food and service. Our kids love the hamburgers. I love the falafel plate. We all fight over the giant pretzels and baklava.

Now that it's getting cooler, you can order from a wide variety of hot drinks. Don't forget to save room for their homemade desserts.</review>

Scan a QR code to get to the online menu. Order and pay online using Toast.

Food gets brought out fairly quickly, everything tasted freshly made. Warm pretzel with sweet mustard was devoured.

Shakshuka was a nice blend of onions, tomatoes, peppers, with 2 poached eggs and Turkish bread on the side - delicious!

Chicken sandwiches, bratwurst, etc, were all decent. Every dish comes with fries so be prepared for lots of fries!

As it's getting cooler, would be nice to have some outdoor space heaters too.< /review><Rating>4</Rating><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Think drunk college meal with what was left of the bread and the mushrooms and broccoli you found in the bin but had forgot about. Of course you are almost out of milk, so not so creamy, but the fact you had two slices of bread left and beer made up for it. Why you would box that experience up and sell it downtown in you greek/german eatery who knows! But kudos for the effort, and what kind of fool orders fettuccine alfredo from such a place anyhow...</Text></record>

I got the Dönnerkebab pita sandwich from the beerhaus menu. The meat, lettuce and other vegetables were good but the pita was cold, dry, and falling apart. A warm, soft pita would have made it so much better. The included fries were very good.< /Text>

I want to love it, but I just can’t.

Pro: great location, lovely outdoor seating area, friendly staff

Con: food. And drink. I left half of my lukewarm-on-arrival scramble on the plate because the cheese tasted moldy.
I left half of the tea in the cup because the water tastes bad and they don’t appear to filter it.<//text>

<text>Out-of-towner here. I come to this place just about every time I wind up in Mountain View. It's consistently good, and just about the only good breakfast option (is anything else on Castro St even open before 10?). Food, service, atmosphere is great. Tons of seating. The baklava is unbelievably good (moist but not soggy, crispy but not stale).</text><GmapID>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6<//GmapID>< resp>

<Text>Their signature omelet and banana strawberry Nutella crêpe were great. The omelet had turkey bacon, turkey ham (Hebrew National hotdogs) and Jack cheese, among other things. The mocha and lemonade were great, too. :-)</Text>< Pictures>

Turkish restaurant with strange greek labeling. The Turkish coffee was quite good. The baklava had a strange taste, not what I am used to from Turkish places in Europe.< /text>

T-BLT was light and had nice flavor. Was simple yet refreshing on the palette. Outdoor seating area was great. Overall was a nice, casual lunch spot, but was a bit pricey for the portion size.< /text>

Nice outdoor seating area. Great desert options. Overall seems like the service time is very fast but not for the kids meal it was very slow. Also, the non pitted olives in the Greek salad caught me by surprise. The salad itself was ok, but not great.< /Review>

This is a surprisingly hidden gem in downtown. Olympus is just next to the train station, with plenty of outdoor seating, and some inside. The menu is fresh, and feels well made from what I've tried. Don't skip, just walk in, and order one of the all day brrakfast items and a double espresso. Then take a seat and enjoy the scenery.</review>

Too busy, wanted to order a second beer and it took 30 minutes. They are new so hopefully will improve. I would have spent more money if I knew my order would arrive quickly.</Review>

This man was just trying to buy a coffee — he wasn’t being overly disorderly. The owner, after charging him for the coffee, then called the police to remove the man for no apparent reason. I felt that this situation was inflated to be more than it was; the owner did not have to treat this man in this way just because of the way he looked and dressed. I was deeply saddened by this. The owner did not have to escalate the situation and mistreat the man in this way. Now the man is handcuffed in a police car. I refuse to come to this restaurant again. This cafe is called Olympus cafe in Mountain View. This post is about the unkind of the owner, he can just asked the man to leave instead of called the police and charged him for the coffee. The man just wanted a coffee and he paid as well. I always believe that we should be kind to people who are less fortunate than us. BE KIND TO ONE ANOTHER. (btw, if you are going to this coffee shop and forget to wear a face mask, they will call the cops. )<//Text>

<Response>{'time': 1600093572388, 'text': 'Dear miss Joanne,\n\nI believe there has been a misunderstanding about what happened to the man that was at my establishment. First, I want to make it clear we did not call the   cops. A man came into my business without a face covering, I told him he must wait outside, but still took his coffee order. Then all of a sudden the cops came. They told me that this man was causing a disturbance at another establishment.\nWe treat all of our patrons with the utmost respect.\nWe have been in business for many years and have a good client tell.\n\nWe also wish that you talked to the police at the time. But you are welcome to contact police department to find out about who called the police. Because we have already talked police department. They are expecting your call.\n\nThan will do announcements to the public together.\n\nPlease contact me if you have any questions.\n\nThis is our second post,  since we since we do not hear from you,\n\nHello\n\nI would like to take this opportunity to clear up a misunderstanding. Attached to this message is the police report regarding the situation. Please take time to review the report so that we can resolve this misunderstanding.\n\nAs noted in the report, the customer was making a problem in the downtown area before he came in to Olympus and showing alcoholic symptoms which has caught the police’s attention and resulted in his arrest. As a restaurant we have no association with the arrest.\n\nWe simply ask that you remove all false accusations from our review page promptly. We do not tolerate racism or the mistreatment of customers at Olympus.\n\nWe tried the post police report here, but google do not accept picture posting here\nsend us a your email than will forward you full police report.\n\nI hope we can resolve this issue smoothly.'}</Response><GmapID>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

One of the waiters was unbelievably rude to me.  I ordered the Dolmades, which, as you can see from the picture I took, INCLUDES PITA.  I received a sad little plate with 4 dolmas and no pita, so I went up to the counter to ask for pita.  A waiter who was just standing around came over to rudely tell me my dish doesn't come with pita.  I pointed to the sign and he just said "well you're not getting pita.  The sign says pita but your dish doesn't come with any."  I asked for a manager and he just said I wasn't getting any pita because he said the dish doesn't come with any.  The cashier said that of course the dish comes with pita... but the waiter continued to argue with me, and instead of bringing me the missing component of my order, slammed plates and completely ignored me so someone else had to bring it to me.  Watch out for the tall man with the beard.  He's rude, dismissive, and tries to cheat you out of things you already paid for.< /Text>

<review>Olympus had the worst restaurant service and food we have ever had at any restaurant anywhere. First off it took 25 minutes for us to get our food. Then my wife's salad was rotting and she had to ask for new salad that took an additional eight minutes to get and it was slightly rotten too. My wife had no salad dressing for her salad. I ordered the gyro plate and was given no pita bread with my meal. I had to ask and wait for a tiny amount of pita bread. Then when I asked the waiter for more pita bread it never came. Both our meals tasted cheap and gross. On top of that the food was very expensive. I could go on and on. Avoid this restuarant. Terrible place.</review><user_name>Steven Foley</user_name><userid>117863785213294147232</userid>< gmapID>

Good food in mountain view. Right next to the train station and the parking lot. I ordered from the Turkish breakfast menu and it was delicious. They need to update their website because the menu prices in the store are at least $2 higher on average than what is listed online. Don't forget to try the desserts!!<//review>

<text>Good ambience, friendly (enough) staff and omelette in point! Gyro sandwich was a bit bland but loved the salad dressing. Great variety of desserts e.g. baklava, opera cake, cheese cakes e.g. not too loud, and self seating type of place. On the cheaper side considering Castro street price range with decent portion!< /text>< Pictures>

<text>Great atmosphere and friendly staff. They have wifi which is great!

I had ordered decaf and they didn't have any after they charged my order. I was about to be a little upset but they were friendly and helpful in finding a replacement.

I didn't have the food, so I can't review that. But the coffee was delicious and fast! The food did smell amazing! I got there at the right time because it does get busy for the morning work crowd :-)</text>< gmapID>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Good place. Has limited indoor seating but a lot of outdoor seating to make up for it.. has a wide variety of dishes on the menu. Recommend ordering the Turkish dishes, the pasta wasn’t really good. Falafels were awesome though. Service was relatively quick. Definitely a place to check out if you are on Castro!</Review>< pictures>

While that's a bit deceiving, I nevertheless wanted to give it a try, too, after passing by so often. OK getting over that false advertising: I love good Turkish food too, but this was a tasteless, Americanized thing. Lamb was dry, lettuce poured from a bag, disappointed. Neighboring other Turkish restaurants (with Greek names, too) are excellent, will stick to them for good Turkish food. Waitress and music were pleasant, though.<//Text>< pictures>

Visited the place for lunch as it is close to the station, before heading out to the hotel. Ordered Cobb salad and pita with gyro. The salad was fresh, tasty and healthy. The gyro was one of the best we've had outside Greece. There was a slight wait as it was the rush hour but it was worth it. The service was okay.</text>

<text>The place is OK but the food was not that amazing. There are many tables, outdoor seating as well, and some good looking desserts that I haven't tried myself. A few beers on tap, not that many. Happy hours with $5 for any beer from the tap.<//text>< Response>

Prices online do not reflect the prices actually at the restaurant. I bought a burger and it was very small. Far smaller than any burger at that price point. Other people with me got some good looking gyros and stuff, but I think the overall consensus was dissatisfied. Biggest kick was that we chose it for it's relatively cheap prices from online and they were a straight up lie.<//review>

Had omelettes twice. The food was good but the service was off. The first time my toast never came. The second it came, but it was a white instead of wheat which I asked for. Hope they could better their service</Text>

I've been going there for years and see the service declining. The last time around, the girl who took my order misplaced/lost it and after waiting for over 45 mins, we realize our order has not been processed. The staff were cold and apathetic, did not apologize, and we left hungry after requesting a refund. I would have liked to re-order, but going by their attitude, felt it was better to go elsewhere. If you choose to eat there, sit outdoors enjoy the view, and always ask for a copy of your receipt to prove that you did order and to ensure you get the items you paid for. I will not be going back.<//Text>

They recently "upgraded" their outdoor seating from European cafe patio to American gastropub deck style. It fits more people and seems more polished but now kind of loses what made this place unique. Will still go for convenience, friendly service, Turkish breakfast and waffles<//text>

You also have to try their original mint tea - it’s awesome. And don’t forget to take one of the delicious Baklava desserts - they are unbelievable!

<text>Went to this place as it was somewhat busy, and I ordered the falafel plate. The people there were very nice, and there was water at the side. The seating was either in or outdoor, and we chose a spot outside looking out towards the train tracks. The falafel was great, and the hummus and pita was good too. I would recommend this to anyone who would want Mediterranean food, and they even have a bakery with lots of baked goods.< /text><rate>5< /rate>< Date>

This is one of the many bakeries and coffee shops in downtown Mountain View but what make this place special are their pastries like baklava.  Prices are comparable to other bakeries.  People stay here for hours here over their coffee, pastries and tablets and laptops. They also serve lunch and dinner.</text>

Good place to hang out after work, offers happy hour pricing on draft beers with a pretty good selection of the staples. Regular beer prices very competitive, nice outdoor beergarten style seating area. Full food and dessert menu available. Definitely Recommend<//Text>

Nice place to hangout on a Sunday afternoon. I just had coffee. Occasionally you will be interrupted by the Caltrain sounds. But overall it's a great place for light food but deep conversation.</Text>

Went to this place as it was somewhat busy, and I ordered the falafel plate. The people there were very nice, and there was water at the side. The seating was either in or outdoor, and we chose a spot outside looking out towards the train tracks. The falafel was great, and the hummus and pita was good too. I would recommend this to anyone who would want Mediterranean food, and they even have a bakery with lots of baked goods.</Text>

This is one of the many bakeries and coffee shops in downtown Mountain View but what make this place special are their pastries like baklava.  Prices are comparable to other bakeries.  People stay here for hours here over their coffee, pastries and tablets and laptops. They also serve lunch and dinner.</text>

<Review>Rly good lamb gyro
Fries look good & crispy (unlike soggy ones @ most greek spots)
Banana bread very good(a little too sugary). The blueberry muffin could also use some work. A trend seems to be forming with the American baked goods.

Good ambiance
Nice outdoor seating
Fast service</Review>< Rating>

I have been coming for five years or longer. Fish tilapia, salmon salad, goat cheese salad are my favorite meals. For a beverage, I choose Turkish tea or Apple tea or Orange tea. It is nice to be recognized by servers, cashiers, and owners as a regular. The location is the best, right by the CalTrain station and, on Sundays, the Farmers' market.</review>

Slow service is my only complaint. Perhaps their kitchen is too small for all the business they have. They serve a nice combination of American food and Turkish food. The coffee is excellent. You can sit inside or outside on the patio where dogs are allowed.<//review>

I love this place and have been coming here for years. It's a great place to visit at the weekends, sit outside, soak up the atmosphere and people watch. The coffee is excellent and the food (Turkish) is excellent too. Prices are very reasonable at about $30 for two<//Review>

<review>I enjoyed my chicken kabob dinner.  The food was tasty and pleasing to the eye as well.  My companion shared a bit of falafel with me,  also well plated but a bit bland.

The baked goods looked fantastic but I did not partake.

Service was efficient.   They have lots of outdoor seating that was not crowded.  It also is away from the pedestrian crowds on the sidewalk.

Parking is near impossible.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Great Turkish/Greek place. One orders food at the front and they bring it to you according to your number. Sitting outside is absolutely gorgeous.

I got a portabella panini, and it was perfectly grilled; the side salad and dressing were really tasty as well. Mom had a strawberry waffle and based on her reactions I would say it was also impeccably done.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Pass this place all the time but never stop.  We were going to another cafe this morning but found it was closed on Mondays.  Stopped here instead and it was a great surprise!  Ordered a chai latte and the greek yogurt with granola.  Super yummy.</review>

One of the best places in the bay area to have a delicious Turkish tea and Turkish pastry in a pleasant outdoor space.</Review>

Great early morning coffee and breakfast. Outdoor seating is good for people watching. Try the Turkish coffee and baklava any time of the day. Opens at 8am! Attentive, solid service too. Be kind to your wait people...They rock the world.< /Text>

Very friendly staff is happy to guide you through the extensive menu. Order at the counter; food will be brought to your table. This is a great place to dine outside on a fine day. Ample portions. Reasonable prices. I’ve never had room for anything from the gorgeous pastry case, but coffee and baklava is at the top of my list for my next visit.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6< /Gmap_id></record>

< Review>
Ordered a gyro, spanikopita, and the British burger. All were quite good and the portions were fairly generous. Worst parts were that the order got slightly messed up (put pickles on the burger despite no pickles request) and the free water dispenser looked empty, encouraging me to buy a sugary drink instead. Overall, still a good place and I'll definitely consider coming back here, especially for the relatively low prices.</Review>

<Text>I came for breakfast but found that ordering pancakes are just that - pancakes. If you want a classic pancake (or french toast) meal with eggs or sausage, everything else is extra. They have a great selection of pastries and desserts, but wish their breakfast options weren't so limited for classic items.< /Text><user_id>113755584291670851034<//user_id>< name>

<Text>TL;DR: Terrible quality service, cutting corners on hygiene, and incredibly overpriced given this quality.

I've been coming to this place over the last year. Had food here at least 20 times.

Service and food quality was already not great, but it has now gotten to ridiculous levels, so have to give this 1 star.
Today, I found a strange piece of meat (that looked like ham) in a chicken omelette I ordered. I went to the waiting staff to note that, and the only reaction I got was: "Are you sure you didn't order something other than a chicken omelette?", followed by them taking my plate and not saying a single word. Great service guys!

Also: some simple sides (like gozleme, Turkish pancakes) have multiplied 2x in price... with no clear justification.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp>< GmapID>

If you like authentic Turkish breakfast, meal, coffee, or dessert Olympus can be your place. I always enjoy their nice salads too. The environment is also good for meetings and working on a laptop or paper. Kids can also enjoy the entree's and desserts alike.</Text>

Average Greek food. This is not so much authentic Greek food but more of a mix between Greek, Turkish and American food. Had high hopes yet food tasted quite bland. For better Greek food look elsewhere. While the food was okay, desserts we're excellent!< /Text>

Visiting from Michigan, found Olympus on Google Maps, arrived and it is amazing! Fresh squeezed orange juice, fantastic coffee, pastries are insane, and I came for breakfast and it was great! I'm a huge breakfast guy and I would definitely come back here! Not to mention the outside seating is the perfect place to get a morning coffee and enjoy the Mountain View Weather.<//Text>

Friendly staff and delicious food fill this little shop on the corner near the train station.  A large outdoor cafe is available to enjoy the weather and the views while dining.  There's a large variety of desserts and pastries; there are so many I have only managed to sample a few.< /text>

Best place for breakfast on Castro Street. Delicious omelets and strong house coffee. If you're a dessert person, the baklava is recommended. Good to sit outside when the weather is good. Fast friendly service.< /Text>

Went there for a coffee and dessert. They have a variety of cakes, baklava and pastries. So it's easy to find an option that you like. We tried baklava and chocolate muffin. While baklava tasted good the muffin was just fine.< /Text>

<Review>I've been here a few times and my experiences have been mixed. The first time I was blown away by the delicious pastries and coffee. The second time I went I had the saddest sandwich ever. I could hardly enjoy the awesome environment and huge patio because my sad sad lunch drained all my energy. I'm sure I'll give it one more try though.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response><gmapID>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6< /gmapID></record>

If I had to put a label on it, I'd call it a Turkish restaurant, but they also serve crepes and scrambles and other conventional breakfast cafe foods.  The food is very good and reasonably priced. The atmosphere is relaxed and comfortable - food ordering at the counter, order numbers on sticks, indoor and outdoor seating. I'm definitely going back for more.<//Text>

<review>Became one of our new favorite places for breakfast.  The smaller or bigger your party, the faster you get in. Their coffee is a delicious blend   Service is fast and friendly - they even recognize us now! Food is wonderful - my friends and I have had everything from the menu, generous portions and everything is very fresh, prices are really cheap compare you get and location of-course. Would (and have) recommend for anyone looking for a non-chain breakfast place.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< UserId.>

Service can be slow, you pay at the counter and they bring it to your table. At different times it can take them anywhere from 5-20min to bring tea with a cake. Food is good. It's near the road and Caltrain station, so can be quite noisy. Outdoor seating has shaded tables.<//Review>

I had an outstanding breakfast and a quick, cheap dinner at this place.
The breakfast was fantastic, with high quality Baklavas and other sweets. I quite like the Turkish/Greek verve and even the cappuccino was passable.
The dinner was nothing fancy but again clean, no-fuss food for a good value.</review>

Service can be slow, you pay at the counter and they bring it to your table. At different times it can take them anywhere from 5-20min to bring tea with a cake. Food is good. It's near the road and Caltrain station, so can be quite noisy. Outdoor seating has shaded tables.< /text>

Not sure if it was because this was my first time eating Turkish food or what, but the meat in my breakfast tasted a bit wierd and shortly after I got a severe case of diahrea. It gets very busy in the morning, b so funny expect a refill on coffee unless you go up and stand there. Very nice folks though.<//Text>

<Name>Yaritza Rodriguez</Name><text>The food is just alright, but the staff is friendly and the place has ample patio seating making it good for hosting families and big groups. It is also a spot one can work out of with plenty of tables and wi-fi so it's not uncommon to find people having lunch meetings and clacking away on weekdays.

Inside there's comfier seating towards the front by the mirror, and a good amount of tables. However, it's not unusual for this area to be highly fragrant with heavy cleaning scents which can compete with the fresh scents of the food and, as is my case, this detail can negatively impact the overall dining experience. If you are not phased by heavy fragrances, it's probably a non-issue for you :)

I still stop by for the occasional chai latte to-go before continuing the rest of my commute, or grab coffee and a snack and work from the patio in warmer weather.< /text></record>

Tomato in my salad was mouldy...other was fine. But I don't want to come again especially with my child. What if my child would eat this tomato?
It's disgusting! They need to monitor the quality of ingredients more attentively.</Text>

I had a Nefeli salad, which didn't have anything special about it. The sauce was very strong (too much vinegar), which may explain why they put it on the side and not already mixed in. I wouldn't come back for this.<//review>

<Review>I ordered a Gyro Pita and waited over 30 minutes for it. It wasn't even crowded. What I eventually got was a pretty sorry excuse for a pita. The meat was all at the bottom and it was just topped with some lettuce. I'm sure some of the other dishes are better, but this experience makes it unlikely that I'll come back for them.</Review>< Pictures>

I had an outstanding breakfast and a quick, cheap dinner at this place.
The breakfast was fantastic, with high quality Baklavas and other sweets. I quite like the Turkish/Greek verve and even the cappuccino was passable.
The dinner was nothing fancy but again clean, no-fuss food for a good value.<//review>

< review>
Doughy, raw pastry, undercooked, reheated, doesn't taste fresh, some random parts dry. Not flaky. Greasy, burnt edges & OVERPRICED. things taste STALE and OLD. Mushroom strudel would be better if it had more mushrooms(fresh everything would be nice) and if the pastry was cooked correctly and flaky and not raw on the inside.(AND LESS EXPENSIVE)
Desserts aren't any better, look upscale but are either way too sweet or underwhelming. Creme brulle cheesecake isn't so bad I like the fresh vanilla bean in there but crust is soft and not crunchy and flaky like traditional cheesecake. It's not the right consistency--a little too soft and no signature crunchy scorched sugar on top--its wet and soft.
Entrees are bland and underwhelming, and overcooked. Salmon extremely expensive for being overcooked and not fresh tasting.
Mint lemonade is nice.
All in all tastes like over priced hyped cafeteria food, which is great if you're into that.
They can do so much better for the prices they're charging.
Owners and Chefs....put some effort, buy local and fresh, don't penny pinch, don't freeze and don't overcook/undercook!
Save your money and take a nice drive to another establishment.</review>

Olympus is great! Their patio is fantastic and the staff is always friendly and efficient. They also have the best selection of baklava in the area, hands down. If you're looking for breakfast or just a place to grab a coffee before catching your train you will be pleased with the reasonable prices and good food.<//Text>

< Review>
Last visit was absolutely horrible! This place needs better staff. Had burnt Swiss burger despite asking for med well.  Asked for hot water for drink but was charged $2.95 for hot tea.  After getting the receipt I asked about the charge, the female staff told me well I have to ring up your water some way.  What???? Later on,  I asked a nearby male staff member who was busing a nearby table,  for more ketchup for the fries, I was told it's up there at the drinks (water/sugar/sweetner) counter near the door and pointed at the place.  No ketchup bottles in sight.  Asked another staff (a different female) about ketchup, she goes "it's in the kitchen ."  Will not be back.  There are plenty of other restaurants in downtown Mtn View w/ better customer service.</Review>

Firstly was charged more than price displayed on window. Secondly had to tell staff that display case had several small flies and one large fly inside, to which they half-heartedly tried to get them out, however we persisted. We then received our pastries, which were luke-warm, when we asked for them to be hot, had sweet pastry with a savory filling, which was not made clear and the contents of the pastry was stale! We ended up taking one bite and throwing both of them away, a waste of nearly $9, would not recommend!!!< /Review><userid>107494585480129904550< /userid><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Rate>1< /Rate>< Response>

<Review>This place is interesting because it offers a mixture of typical American breakfast food with middle eastern. The portions were huge, but the food was just OK. It is pricier than other better breakfast cafes in the area. I regret being to full to try the Arabic sweets and American cakes, which were very tempting.</Review>< username>

<text>One of our favourite spots for sweets! Their triangle baklava is a must every visit, and if you can go for breakfast/brunch try their kaymak + bal + Turkish tea! Absolutely delicious.
The staff is always friendly and makes you feel welcome.</text>< Date>

My first Turkish food experience, and it was, just, OK. Perhaps I didn't order the right breakfast item (chicken omelette).
There are lots of choices, quiet atmosphere and good service.  Check it out.<//text>

<Text>Amazingly delicious juicy baklavas!! They have 3 or 4 different kinds of baklava and basically all of them taste amazing. The price is good and staff is friendly. They have plenty of space outside to enjoy your delicious desserts.

The not so good: I tried their lamb skewers and most of the meat was very chewy that some pieces i just could not breakdown with my teeth ( in the picture my plate looks beautiful though :D ). The salad and rice that came with it was good though. We ordered some falafels and they were not that good--the spices were super strong--We've never tasted falafels with that strong flavor before. Maybe I'll give the meat a second try in the future but for now I'm coming back for their baklava!!</Text>< Pics>

The nuts in the baklava look like taco meat, and the whole thing tastes burned. Inedible. Cappuccino is watery and bitter. Service is friendly, but will look elsewhere next time.</Text>

<Review>This is a great place to grab a quick breakfast, or to sit down and sample the broader menu at brunch. I've done both and absolutely love their pastries, especially Borek which is a flaky pastry filled with meat.

What a great find. We loved the Lamb Pita, and mixed beef and lamb Pita so much, we went back for breakfast the next day. And that didn't disappoint either. We will be back for more soon...</Review>

This place has high quality food at decent prices for this area. It was fast service and they have a nice outdoor seating area right next to one end of Castro St., Mountain View. The egg sandwich on a bagel and the hashbrowns were both very tasty!<//review>

It was ok. The chicken pita was ridiculous since it barely had anything in it. The sauce on the side was completely watered down. Chocalatte cake was not fresh and while I was sitting inside the place a huge cockroach claimed up my leg. I will never go back. The only thing that was good, was Turkish tea.</Review>

Solid spot. Great coffee (never burned) and pretty good pastries, though a bit pricey.
The service is quite volatile. Sometimes they forget about one of your orders, and they almost never bring all your order at the same time.< /Text>

Very good Turkish desserts and the patio is great to enjoy them with a tea. I was even lucky to have a customer with a very nice voice playing guitar and singing at a nearby table, but I don't expect that to happen often :)

Bosphorus would be better than caltrain tracks, but still a very enjoyable experience!

I should try their breakfast next time I stay in the area.<//review>

The toasted simit here tastes better than many in Istanbul! It's fresh and flaky and covered in sesame seeds. The sulaç pudding is fantastically creamy with a perfect hardened texture on the top. The menemen egg scramble is A+ as well.

My favorite lunch spot after a long bike ride. Close to Caltrain!</Review><Gmap_id>0x808fb73426a32365:0x4fcf12f9e19756d6</Gmap_id><UserId.>115232118318632617069</UserId.></record></dataset><record>

<text>Absolutely delicious! It's exactly like Crepevine with slight differences in menu choices. I recommend this place whole-heartedly! Delicious food and good service, not too long a wait. You get to watch the trains go by as you eat.

We ordered the chicken panini and the French toast. Both were delicious!

It's in a good location and close to parking buildings. Not too crowded when I went (Wednesday at 4) although with how tasty this place is I imagine weekends and afternoons can get quite crowded.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><user>100643008006378599418< /user>< username>

Encountered VERY RUDE service by a young girl at cash register while waiting at Mountain View station from out of town. Subway across from station told me this place around corner has restroom. I tried to look for quick pickup so I can used their restroom. But 1 little piece of pastry even cost $3.95. She asked if I wanted it heated up, but then tell me it's going to take 6+ minutes. I said no thank you, I'm just waiting for my transit. She put the spanakopii pastry in a bag and put it on side of counter. I gave the cashier girl $5.00 then she said with tax it comes to $4.31
So I gave her $5.00 then told her wait a minute, I have a penny, handed her additional penny (1¢) then waited for my change but I didn't get it so I told her "um, change please?" Then she goes "you gave me a penny, what do you think? That I was going to give you a DOLLAR?" What the heck?! That's NO way to talk to ANY customer!
I said I haven't got my 70¢ back yet but she insisted she gave it back already, which I don't remember But it's just 70¢ & I didn't have time to argue about it. But she's just standing there not even giving me the receipt so I told her "receipt please" and she only reluctantly gave it to me making additional comment "what, you think I was going to cheat you or something?" And rudely stuck the receipt at me. I really felt like sticking the pastry back at her and get my $5 back, plus with her attitude she'll probably claim I tried to steal $5 from her anyway. So I just walked out.
After getting to my destination, I check my receipt, it said I gave her $5.00, not $5.01. I checked my wallet, I had at least 2 quarters in there before, so if she really gave me 70¢ back, I should have at least a dollar worth of quarters in there but I only have 3 right now. I'll never go back to this stinking place and hope the owner will fire her soon!</review>

The Turkish dishes are their best (my favorites are the Sucuk Yumurta and the Sucuk Toast, because I love the Turkish sausage), but the other breakfast fare is good as well. The Turkish pastries are good, but the non-Turkish options look unremarkable. And don't bother with the uninspired non-Turkish dessert case, get a Turkish dessert like baklava instead.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

I eat here frequently and I've been very happy with the food and the service. The kaymak and bal is very good, as are many of their savory and sweet pastries. I'm quite fond of the gozleme.

I also appreciate that it's not trying to be fancy or pretentious like many of the new restaurants on Castro. It's just good food.< /Review>

<Text>Visited this place regularly for three months when I lived close to Castro. Absolutely love the breakfast items, must try the stuffed omlette selection and pancakes along with their cappuccino. Personally love some of the Turkish treats they offer like the gozleme stuffed with spinach and feta cheese or the baklava and the spanakopita. The seating outside is great, directly overlooking the Caltrain station and on Sundays the farmers market.</Text>< pictures>

<text>Came for dinner, their gyros are horrible. They're anything but a gyro. They come unwrapped and full of lettuce and other crap that does NOT go in a gyro and I'm not talking on the side. What kind of gyro comes with a thin pita split open with mostly green letuce (instead of onions, tomatoes, lamb, fries tzaziki). When you eat, it falls apart and you have to resort to fork and knife. I'm never coming for dinner here again.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<review>Turkish & Greek dishes + American breakfast + American/Mediterranean cafe entrees & lots of cakes/pastries/desserts. Casual & pleasant cafe atmosphere with outdoor seating (helpful since we often walk there and eat outside with our dog). Service is always pleasant.
I have to confess many dishes are imperfect (for example, I'm always looking for a good breakfast spot; they have a lot of breakfast options, but I find them just OK), but I like some of their items a lot. That plus the service and atmosphere have me coming back often.
I like their desserts, pastries, & paninis. What to get:
- chocolate cake (chocolate cake with chocolate mousse)
- spinach-and-feta gozleme (a savory Turkish pastry...like a filled flaky flatbread)
- chocolate-hazelnut croissant (the croissant is definitely on the very soft side, but it makes me happy enough)
- Athenian Panini (grilled bell pepper, grilled eggplant, tomato, Kalamata olives, provolone)
-Shakshuka
- Capellini Pomodoro (angel hair pasta w/ tomato, basil, olive oil, garlic).
- mint tea< /review><Name>Catherine Nguyen< /Name></record></dataset><record>

The Dolmas was very mushy. Pine nuts not recognizable in the Dolmas .The lamb gyro was very chewy like jerky.The tomatoes were pink not red. No sauce that could be counted because like the one slice of cucumber was at the end of the pita. Awful.</Review>

< review>
A Turkish bakery and caffe. The service was great, friendly staff, and a great environment. The owner is a nice man from Turkey, he owns a restaurant down the street that we are going to have to check out tomorrow.

We ordered a chocolate chip cookie, and it was massive and delicious, definitely worth the dollar fifty. We also ordered an Acma, which was described to us as a cinnamon roll without the cinnamon. Free hot water and Wi-Fi too, overall great experience. Highly Recommend.

The next day when we stopped by however, we tried to get a cup of hot water to put our tea in, and they tried to make us pay for it, unlike most establishments, which kind of put a dent in the love of the place.<//review>

<text>(Translated by Google) Excellent food, excellent coffee, very quiet place.
I recommend ordering the twist on pita bread, they give it with a salad that has a delicious dressing.
I ordered a large American coffee, and it really is great; I like that they have liquid milk to put the coffee and they have brown sugar to sweeten.
Desserts look delicious I ordered the chocolate mouse in a glass and it is a delight for those who want to eat sweet. To my taste it is something cloying.

(Original)
Excelente comida, excelente café, lugar muy tranquilo.
Recomiendo pedir el giro en pan pita, lo dan con una ensalada que tiene un aderezo delicioso.
Pedí un café americano grande, y realmente es grande; me gusta que tienen leche líquida para ponerle al café y tienen azúcar morena para endulzar.
Los postres se ven deliciosos yo pedí el mouse de chocolate en Copa y es una delicia para los que apetecen de comer dulce. A mi gusto es algo empalagoso.</text>< Name>

(Translated by Google) A lifetime option for a quick coffee shop on Castro Street in mountain view, close to Google, Computer history museum. Beware of the American caffe, you're basically a watery espresso ... The chocolate pudding looks appetizing, but it's a type of flan, but quite a bit, I do not think it's very good. The espresso was good
