We camped in the campground with a 20' trailer. It was not easy getting up Kaiser pass with it during such a busy time of year but the destination was well worth it. The campground has multiple places to access the river for swimming and riding rapids, as well as good fishing spots. Bathrooms were well kept and despite the campground being full, we didn't feel crowded. The hot springs and Doris Lake were fun little hiking trips and towards the end of my trip I treated myself to an hour at the bathhouse in a private tub with hot mineral water from the natural springs ($7 per 30 min).<//Review>

Not easy to get to but fun to get to. Quaint and interesting when you do get there. We stopped in at the cafe for lunch while hunting for hot springs. The cafe had great burgers and good beer. The hot springs were meh. In one of the hot springs there are creepy mud faces that previous visitors have sculpted into the banks.<//Text>

<Text>Great place to relax, explore, experience something totally new and out of the ordinary. Got a ridiculously cheap coupon off Groupon. Staff is very helpful. Springs are really unique. The views are phenomenal. The drive up was amazing including the one lane road to get there. Recommended.</Text>< pics>

This place is heaven on Earth! I've stayed a couple times in the campground, only for a few days on long weekends. Finally, I was able to book a cabin for a whole week and got a chance to explore the area (soak in Little Eden, swim in Tule Lake, drive to Ward Lake, rent a boat on Florence Lake, hike to Silver Pass on JMT etc). All of these places were unique and incredibly scenic. Not to mention the hot springs and the river. One day I swam 5 times and still couldn't get enough of it. This was one of the best vacations I've ever had. A badly needed break in the midst of the pandemic.
All employees were incredibly helpful and went above and beyond to ensure we had a good stay (e.g. fixed our clogged restroom and even gave us refund for it).
COVID regulations of the Fresno County were followed - people wore facemasks inside the store, showers were desinfected after each use.
Tip: Verizon doesn't have cell coverage here, only AT&T does (even LTE), consider buying a temporary prepaid sim card before going.< /Text>

<text>It's a bit of an effort to get out here, but it's gorgeous. The last 13 miles or so are a one lane road with the 9000 ft. cliff at your side..... Hairy yet very fun and a great adventure. Great trout fishing in the most picturesque country.<//text>< Pictures>

<Text>Visited for the day! The one lane mountain road was definitely an adventure! Had a great time. Met alot of interesting people. Used the bath house to clean up before we left.  Staff was friendly.  The views were spectacular!  Food at the restaurant was mediacor. Twice baked potatos were really bad.< /Text><GmapID>0x8095c3ed347155dd:0x98c0c4595a5df939<//GmapID><Name>Terri Peterson<//Name>< Pics>

< review>
Stayed in 3 of the one room housekeeping cabins, they are the cheapest option before tent cabins and we had 10 people. We got a nicely secluded and area for cabins 8, 9, 10. It is so beautifully quiet up there, really a welcome change from the busy hell that yosemite has become. The drive on kaiser pass isnt scary or dangerous, its mainly navigating the oncoming traffic, would not do it at night though!

We really enjoyed nearby doris lake and I also hiked with a friend to devil’s bathtub. Many other bountiful options are nearby in terms of hikes. I would definitely come prepared with your own food, the restaurant is what you’d expect in a place so rustic and remote, the food at the general store is marked up due to remoteness too. Best bet is to bring your own cooler and just restock ice every day. We did a lot of delicious campfire cooking and brought a propane stovetop.

My biggest gripe was with the hours of the bathhouse/spa. The only showers in the whole place are part of this facility which is only open 10am-8pm. Tough if you want to shower before or after a long hike. The natural hot springs were interesting, though not my favorite. They are in the ruins of old spas, have a lot of floating material in them. Definitely bring at least 3 kinds of bug spray, the major rains from this winter mean MANY mosquitoes.<//review>

<Text>Shortly – it was a very good experience. Very nice, unique place.

For details, see below.

ROAD: Many people are talking here about the road, so I will tooJ. A 4x4 is NOT required to get there. Or any kind of big car is NOT required/necessary/preferred. You’ll be fine on your Prius, Fusion, Focus, Corolla or whatever it is.  Because of the reviews here, I took my expedition, but it’s only advantage was its size and comfort. The road is narrow and bumpy, but the bumps are not big enough to stop your vehicle of any kind. Once again, the 2 things to be aware of on the last 13 miles is the narrow road (just 1 way. Although, all the drivers are very polite and there are many “turn arounds” to use, so you won’t have to back up, if there’s a car ahead of you.) and sharp turns. That’s about it. If I ever decide to go there again (it is unlikely. See below why), I’ll just drive my sedan.

CABINS. This place is most accurately described as a campsite. So don’t expect too much urban civilization. After all, it’s a getaway camp. BUT I am taking a star off for the MICE we were accompanied by at night. Fine with me, but my wife was quite scared and didn’t feel comfortable.

NATURE. Now this is what you should be coming here for. The Nature. It’s beautiful, it’s majestic, it’s breathtaking. AND this place is not very populated (at least as of now, Sept 2018). I love getaway places so this was perfect for me. Hikes towards your hot springs vs just having a pool by the hotel is super fun.

*something to be aware of: When you arrive there, they will give you a little map of the place. Well… my suggestion would be not to rely too much on that mapJ)) it gives a good general understanding of what’s where, but that’s it. I.E. 2 cm on 1 portion of the map could represent 200FT and to the left of the map those same 2 cm could be actually a mile long… So… just keep that in mind.

Would I go there again? Once again, great place, good experience. But I drove there for 5 hrs, one way (from Sacramento) and in my opinion it is not worth it. Not their fault, of course. I would do it for 3 hrs, but not 5.<//Text>< Rate>

The cabins were clean and the bed was comfortable and cozy.   Great place for a couples get away or for a whole family.  Even for a group of friends.  The people working treated everyone like an old friend and made us feel welcome.  The scenery is California at its best.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>The facilities are pretty run down and the landscaping needs attention.  The hot pools are super slimy which makes it slippery. The concept has great potential though. This place could be turned into something incredible with a little TLC.< /Review>< pics>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>I'm so torn about this place...like a lot of places actually. The location is a bit off the beaten trail and requires you to do the last 12 or 13 miles on a one lane paved road with a few areas that you're looking down a cliff side. There are cars, trucks and RVs thing both ways do it can be a bit tense at times. Apparently my wife and another camper there have PTSD from that road. The other camper actually left early because she had to get it over as soon as possible! Lol. Unbelievable!

We studied in a tent cabin that was bare bones but serviceable. There was a wooden deck, solar powered light in the tent, cots with mattresses, a picnic table and bear box. Bears came thru at night so be sure you use the box or leave your food and coolers in the car covered up!

Once you were there you are surrounded by granite features that my kids loved to climb and scramble on. The river was a great place to sit and even take a lazy ride down stream in an inner tube.

The fly fishing was so relaxing (small fingerlings) and they even stock the river in a couple of places so you can catch your meals if you want to with a spinner and lures.

There are a couple of lakes that are a bit of a hike but so worth it once you get there. Don't forget your water. You're going to need it. I would even recommend some food and swim wear do you can relax there for a couple of hours.< /Text>< Date>

<text>This place is like Iceland to the vikings: Beautiful but I don't want you here. If you're reading this, please keep this small valley gem clean and respect the forest. This place is worth 5 stars but i hope this one star caught your eye so that you read this and respect the environment.

P.s. I only speak on the location and not the resort facilities experience. I have yet to try the services.<//text>< Pictures>

<time>1560796034755</time><text>Amazing location with beautiful views and comfortable amenities.

I can't put into words how wonderful our stay was, other than I can't wait to come back for another stay
The hot springs are relaxing, with beautiful views. The cabins are cozy and clean and have their own showers and bathrooms, but the resort still has a bath house fed by the hot springs.
The camp store has all the common items you might have forgotten to pack, and the resort also has a small restaurant.
This place has everything you need!

My favorite part was the hike up the mountain (about 2 miles) to Doris Lake. While the river was cold from melting snow, the lake was the perfect temp.

Like I said, I can't wait to come back. This place is amazing!!< /text><name>Jason Bombardier</name></record>

<Review>Majestic. Without judgment of not knowing what it would be, other than "outdoorsy camping spot at elevation", I was blown away. We car camped the first few nights, great camp host, then got a cabin the last night. Campsites each so unique, some too close to neighbors with kids :p but breathtaking. Paved road in camp area made getting to bathroom accessible for wheelchair. Our first campsites had soft sand, not great to roll on, we moved to an area on river side who's main area was more compacted and easier to roll on. Not really great, but more possible than many other camping options. Getting to natural Hot spring not accessible, BUT there's a concrete hot tub with rails and a drop seat to get in with natural Hot spring water. An amazing masseuse offered fantastic restorative massage. (Camping with hot tub and massage? And a restaurant! Wow) We drove in a lowered handicap accessible van, and if a few pot holes were bigger we'd be in trouble. UNDERSTAND THIS, you will have to drive slow if you have a low car, no 4 wheel drive. It's a task in patience, but absolutely can be done, and it's a gorgeous drive with breathtaking views... For the passenger!  Leaving there were fire trucks responding to a fire, that were able to pass us on this crazy cliff. You'll need a drink after you get off that road, but you'll be in a hidden Paradise.< /Review>< user_name>

My favorite thing about California so far is this hidden gem. So many great memories from this place. Amazing historic, clean and updated cabins at great prices. Very helpful employees and staff. Endless hiking and exploring opportunities. Beautiful pristine hot springs you can have to yourselves. Bring your friends and family to truly wow them. The road in is one of the best parts. Safe and easily accessible, but not for the faint of heart. Love it!</text>

<review>Area is great to visit.  Great store for little things.

Stay away from the burger shack.  Waaay overpriced and not that great.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNzrqaum8jydRHTsOfPVGa8gU9-oKIsgOGTp4o=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

We enjoyed our stay at the cabins. They have awesome people working there, very helpful.
The restaurant is very conveniently open for lunch and dinner, so I didn't have to cook. Mini store has just about anything you may need in your stay. Overall we enjoyed our stay, only if they could fix the road to get there....</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

So relaxing! Beautiful views and local trails. Wish we had stayed more than 1 night. Bring your own snacks and drinks bc there isn't much to choose from at the shop. The drive up the mountain was more nerve wracking than expected, but just take your time and you'll be fine. We did it in a Camaro, hehehehe.</review>

<Text>Really nice hidden resort/campground, the road gets a little narrow and bumpy but is paved the entire way, hot springs are a short walk from the campground and cabins. They have a well stocked general store and a restaurant that serves buffalo. Definitely recommend visiting.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Nice hidden place. Not a EASY drive or for the inexperienced driver the road there and back is a challenging and dangerous as I have ever navigated which is many! You will need a lot of time and patience on the road as speeds are typically 5-15 mph 5mph being more the norm due to the numerous blind very narrow sharp turns. This road can seriously mess with your vehicle! There is no way to get there once the winter snow sets in as they can easily get 15 to 25 feet of snow during the winter which completely buries what actual real road there is! Because of its adventure to get there the area is usually not overly populated which is nice! Definitely a diamond in the ruff!</review>< Pictures>

The road to Mono Hot Springs from Huntington lake has about 13 miles of single lane, and pretty harsh roadway. Definitely take that into account when driving there. The resort was fine. To get to some of the hot springs from the resort you'll need to cross a log bridge. Restaurant at the resort is pretty overpriced for what you get.<//text>

<text>Almost every summer, we came to Mono Hot Springs Resort for a shower about once a month while camped at Jackass Meadows. Bathing in the South Fork San Joaquin River, or with water heated over a fire, could only go so far in getting clean. I loved coming here for the for the showers and getting to get ice cream at the general store.<//text>< pictures>

<Rating>3</Rating><Text>Six miles of highway followed by 13 miles of at-times single lane road. Four-wheel drive not necessary but recommended - other vehicles may not be sturdy enough to navigate the rough road. The springs themselves are meh at best - good if you're there. Be aware that access to the springs (there are several) require navigating over single and double-beam narrow logs that have been somewhat jerry-rigged over the river - not difficult but a challenge for those with disabilities or balance problems. There is a campground plus a resort with cabins, a restaurant, a spa, massage therapy, etc.< /Text></record>

We camped near the Mono Hot Springs Resort. The Resort itself is very rustic.  They have small cabins and tent cabins for rent. We had dinner at the restaurant, a buffalo burger with rice and salad (no potatoes that day). Since the location of this resort is so out there we weren't surprised that the fresh food delivery might not be that great. The food was overpriced but tasty after camping for the last six days. We poked our heads into the spa area, it looked like regular bathtubs with the spring water piped in. Check for a groupon if your interested in staying at the Resort. We spent most of our time in the river and hiking around the beautiful granite rocks. The nearest natural hot spring was small and crowded, but really hot! Jennifer our camp host was very nice and friendly and knew the area very well. The road was pretty rough for us but well worth the visit.</Review>

<review>Absolutely one of my favorite places I have found in this lifetime! Between soaking in a variety of hot spings with a wide range of temperatures and views, being able to eat in restaurant with great food and tables on an outdoor patio, and because this is the part of the Sierras where they never built roads across the mountains so you don't have crowds - when I go in in Mid-June or after Labor Day in September it feels like I have the whole place practically to myself!  I'm an Internet consultant and with AT&T cell phone reception and 4G Internet connection, if I don't tell my clients I'm camping at almost 7,000 ft in the Sierra High Country they'd never know!

I've come here three trips for a couple weeks each over the last two years, and can't wait to go back this summer. Spectacular 180 degree views from sunup to sundown just up the road from the hot springs makes Mono Hot Springs for me probably the place I have found the greatest peace in this live time!<//review><pics>None< /pics><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Spent 4 nights in a 1 bedroom cabin with 2 kids. For being such a remote location we were surprised at the quality. Had at&t cell/internet, refrigerator, shower, towels, full kitchen with pots/pans...ect. Everything was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. Only complaint was that our fold out futon had a broken hinge, which interrupted our planned sleeping arrangements. We ended up trading nights sleeping on floor. Not a big deal to us. The restaurant was decent and the store has most of the things you might forget to pack. Not many fish, didn't talk to a single person who caught anything. Hot springs are legit, but require a short drive and hike. Didn't use the bathhouse. Perfect place to read a book, hike, soak, and forget real life.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Text>Once you're off the main road you have to drive a 10+ mile single lane road to Mono Hot Springs (MHS). After reading about that bumpy, rocky, scary road, we rented a 4WD SUV, plus we needed more car space then what we had. You can navigate the road with other cars but it will be a challenge. If you come across other cars going the opposite direct there are many turnouts. We passed a big delivery truck and other trucks and cars, you just have to patient and road friendly. Still, it's a scary, harrowing road as there are no guard rails. One might ask just how many cars went over the side and tumbled over the cliff. While I saw cars drive it at night, I never would,as it's pitch black and there are no lights. I suggest day time driving. Key is to drive slow and be careful. Resort - Beautiful! We occupied # 4, a double space camp site. Big area, we had two tables, a fire pit and lots of room. It was quiet and comfortable, with lots of trees and shade. One minute walk to river. Toilet facilities were decent, kept clean and stocked with TP. I just wiped the seat with a disinfectant wipe before using. Jennifer, the camp host was more than pleasant and friendly. She went out of her way to answer all our questions, gave us suggestions, and offered a map while not on duty. I actually saw her doing laundry and asked a quick question and she stopped to speak to me. She is so warm and friendly. We hiked to Doris Lake, an accomplishment for me, because it was a steep hike through a path with rocks and boulders. I had to stop many times, sweated a lot. and breathed hard, but I wanted to do it to prove to myself that I could. It took one hour to walk up and 45 minutes to walk down. The payoff was a beautiful lake. We swam and had a great time. Walking down was a lot easier. Per their website they stock the river throughout the Summer so we were excited to fish for trout. We bought all new fishing poles and tackles. Sadly, we found out the river was not stocked and there were no fish. We soaked in the hot springs, hiked, swam, and had a great time! We'll definitely be back!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x8095c3ed347155dd:0x98c0c4595a5df939</Gmap_id></record>

<text>We had a blast! The resort was booked but the camp host had a few camping spots open for the days we needed. DEFINITELY not a 1 day trip! Plan on staying minimum 2 nights to do all the hot springs, mud baths and hike up to Doris Lake & Little Eden. Awesome hikes for all ages! ⛺️😎😃 Yes, as u pass Hunington Lake & go up to Mono Hot Springs  it turns into a one way street. Expect bumps, pot holes, & narrow road but we're adventurous so we didn't mind. The scenery was wonderful but if ur afraid of heights good luck. We took our Prius & had no problems. If u run into other cars coming there's little side outs that u can go to or one of u will have to reverse to get to one. The restaurant was ok for us. Bill for 2 adults & a child (adult plate) came out to $73+ so expect to pay high prices for the restaurant food. We thought the store had decent prices compared to other reviewers. Make sure to bring hiking boots as the trails are rocky & muddy because sandals are going to hurt. you'll have to take them off to walk the trails. Don't forget the bug repellent bcus the evenings come with mosquitos! HAPPY TRAILS!!😍<//text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

We camped here for one night, unfortunately for us the cabins required at least two night minimum. It was surprisingly busy after feeling like we got lost in the backcountry - the worn single lane road was manageable though. There is running water and various hot springs nearby with one more commercialized and others you have to cross a log to get to them from camp - go slow on the log, it begins pretty sturdy but midway is when your heavy footsteps catch up with you. We ate at the restaurant which was busy and ran out of several dishes towards the end of the night.</review>

My wife thinks it’s one of the most courteous retail outlets of any type in the Tahoe area some places can be very rude and stuck up.

I also love the fact that masks are optional for you people that gave a one star review in regards to mask you still have the opportunity to shop where you want. For now. Wake up America we are losing our freedoms very fast.

Can’t wait to return this summer this is always been our go to winter shop I bet it’s great for summer as well.< /Review>< Rate>

Steve here is the man! Quality products and great service. I use to always shop for new snowboards/splitboards online but no more. This shop is hands down the jam. Will be returning here every time.<//Text>

<text>There’s a sign on the front door that proudly states that they will not be enforcing the mask order, and then none of the three employees inside were wearing masks. This isn’t political, I just don’t understand why anyone with an ounce of humanity wouldn’t just wear a mask. I see the owners on here arguing about over reporting of COVID deaths and how we should respect the wishes of the business. Why don’t you care enough about your customers to simply have your employees wear a mask, and ensure your customers are wearing mask (as it is mandated everywhere in the state)? It’s not about likelihood of death from the virus, it’s about preventing the spread of a disease that’s been running rampant for nearly a year. I don’t need CDC or WHO reporting to know that this virus is serious, and that it’s highly infectious. It’s all around me all the time. We all can see it’s impact on the health of our friends and family. Even if YOU don’t want to acknowledge it, someone who wasn’t even your customer may be impacted by your choice not to endorse the mask mandate. Your crusade to give the State of California a middle finger is not noble, it’s stupid and dangerous, not to mention completely needless. Stop putting your employees, your customers, and anyone else who they come into contact with at risk.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1605799783514, 'text': 'We’re not arguing with anyone, nor are we making this political. The news is inaccurate, the tests are flawed, and the science is not settled. It’s simple, if it makes you uncomfortable then it’s easy to turn around and walk away.

Thank you for the one star review over an issue that if bothered you....you never had to enter our business.'}</response>< GmapID>

Not only does this place not "enforce" the California mask mandate, they don't even have their staff wearing masks and won't put one on, even if asked, making it an unsafe place for everyone.  They were not even willing to wear ones when faced with children who asked them to and were clearly not comfortable.<//Text>

<Text>Loved my experience here not the first time I've been here but first time I've made a major purchase here. My girlfriend is just getting into the sport and was having trouble finding boots in particular that fit her. While having no real luck anywhere else. This place not only had the best variety of snow board boots we'd seen ,but the staff was awesome and willing to work with us to pick and find a boot that best fit not only my girlfriends tiny feet( women's 5) but  the beginner style of riding she'll be doing as well.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

As more than 235,000 people are DEAD from COVID and hospital being overwhelmed , their policy of deliberate noncompliance of  mandatory face masks use, makes it impossible to shop as well as criminal. This is an enormous disservice to the public.< /Review>

<response>{'time': 1605717873307, 'text': 'Audrey-\nI am curious if you can tell me how many of those reported COVID deaths were inaccurately reported, because from my understanding the CDC and health “experts” have come out and told Americans that many of the deaths that are classified as COVID are only COVID related, some of them may not have nothing to do with COVID, it was just more profitable and/or Convenient for hospitals to report such information. There are endless stories from reputable sources stating exactly that. I have countless family members on the front lines....nurses and doctors and hospital managers who report a different world to me. We refuse to be the governing arm between the government and customers, that is not our job. Our job is to take the information provided and decipher through it and figure out what is true and what we will tolerate. Nothing that we are doing is criminal behavior. We live in a free society and own a private business that clearly states our stance on our front door to prevent anybody from coming in who disagrees or is uncomfortable. Not everyone agrees with much of what is going on in our society right now, so we are in a situation where people will shop where they’re comfortable, go out into public if they are comfortable, send their kids to school if they are comfortable.....and there becomes a point at which you don’t do exactly what the media and the government tells you is safe for you… You gather information and make an informed decision that is best for your livelihood, business, health and sanity and we have done just that. If you’re able to find information that reports all the inaccuracies within COVID reporting or the deaths that COVID lockdowns and regulations have caused, I’m all yours! Please do not bash my business on a public platform because of my beliefs. I don’t believe in the efficacy of masks but I respect other businesses by wearing one if they have requested me to do so. Please have the same respect for us.'}</response>< gmapID>

Stopped by while visiting Lake Tahoe.

Great customer service with knowledgeable staff. My son bought a beautiful skate board and some shoes.

We actually returned the next day and bought more stuff.

Was a great place to take amazing pictures.

Also while you are here make sure to visit the Hemp shop across the alley as well.<//text>

<response>{'time': 1605716155554, 'text': 'Pamela-\nUnfortunately we are living in an extremely divided nation right now where rules and regulations are altered daily in order to make people feel safe. At the end of the day, the COVID numbers have ADMITTEDLY been reported inaccurate since day one, tests are flawed, the “rules” that the government are making to “keep the community safe” make zero sense, and most importantly the government is using small businesses like ours to be the enforcement arm between them and the people and we refuse to do so. We have followed all sides of this since day one, and since day one have decided that what we’re being fed is not enough to make us forfeit our rights and enforce mandates that we do not believe in, that’s the beauty of a free world (or what used to be) is that we are a private business who warns all customers before they come through the doors of the stance we are taking....so if you feel uncomfortable you don’t have to come in! Generally these platforms are used for feedback on customer service and product offerings and we would appreciate it staying that way. If you would like to communicate any further, I’m open to discussion and can be reached at\n530-541-4444. Otherwise, we put a sign up on the entrance door to warn customers who may be uncomfortable with our decision before they enter...to avoid this back and fourth. We are juggling a lot more than the average eye can see, so before you bash us on a public platform...maybe consider having a conversation with us or understanding that there are many sides to a lot of what’s going on in the world. I absolutely hate most of what’s happening in society right now, and think that this pandemic and masks are hurting people in ways we don’t see yet. BUT I respect and support my local businesses and when I enter their store....I give them the respect they are asking, please do the same.'}< /response><Rate>1</Rate><Text>Is a minus star possible?

<review>Rented 2 paddle boards at 11am on a Sunday for "all day" returned Monday morning when they opened at 9am. Charged me $20 late fee because I didn't return by 7pm Sunday. Guy who rented didn't say anything about 7pm. I consider "all day" 24 hours. I asked them to reconsider given they had none of the other boards out  - but its policy in fine print. Good for you - I'll rent elsewhere from now on. Otherwise, the other guys were helpful which I am giving a second star for.<//review>< gmapID>

Such great service! Every one who works there is very sweet and helpful! They helped us out with our ski and snowboard rentals and got us great deals on lift tickets!

{'time': 1391725927802, 'text': "Hey there Judgey Thisy!! I'm unsure if you have the right shop, we have many more than just 4 boards of Gnu and Lib, and carry many other brands, such as; Capita, Smokin, Bataleon, Lobster, and Arbor. If you were interested in demoing a new board we have that program available as well, to get you on a board with new technology. Our women's and men's rental fleet of boots is a mixed bag of Boas and Lace up boots, some customers do prefer lace ups so we make sure we have a bunch of options for every type of rider."}<//resp>
< review>
Not into this place!
They have 200 old as hell snowboards marked at 10% off Full retaill Value!
MY GOD! the board is a 2004 and im supposed to pay $300 for it! My God!
I asked where are all the new boards? " We have Gnu! Yeah, they have Gnu, They have 4 new GNU models, 4 new lib tech models Counting kid Boards, and some  DC Snowboards.
I looked at the rental Fleet and most of there snowboards are from the late 90's.
The rental boots are no differnt. My Wife's friend rented here and, the boot they gave her was missing the inside Lace. She was told your a begginer, you wont need it.
End Game:    ** Old rental boots ** 90s-2000 models without the easy "Boa".
They have 7 boa rental boots, they are the kids models!!! LOL LOL<//review>

<text>I ordered an absolutely delicious mezze plate (fried chicken version) from here yesterday and it was so fresh and so tasty. The warm pita bread, the creamy hummus, the flavorful falafel, the crunchy chicken, the zingy sauces, - it was a delight. I can not wait to eat here again.</text></record></dataset><record>

<review>Why are you sooooooo good?! This place never disappoints. Tried their fries today... idk what’s in them but they are the best fries in LA hands down!!! I mean the fried chicken is my all time favorite along with the falafel plate but these fries came out of no where and stole my heart. Was that homemade ketchup that came with it? Thank you for making my dinner complete.< /review><rating>5<//rating>< username>

This place really gets the flavors correct, everything from the falafel to the pickled onions was wonderful. The hummus was perfectly creamy and the side salad had the unexpected burst of fresh herbs. The flatbread had a nice char and a great texture that paired well with the sauces which cannot be passed up, make sure to try some Toum and S'rug if you like garlic and heat.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I am afraid to recommend this place to anyone as I do not want to prices to go up. However, we need to support our local businesses. This place is absolutely amazing. Fresh food, Great ingredients. This is a must try if you are in dtla.</review>

I thought the beat sandwich was amazing.
I had one or two slightly salty bites--which I love, I have a somewhat salty palate--so if you're sensitive to that maybe ask for it without the olives (pretty sure that's what did it, but someone feel free to correct me).
Will be back often!</Text>

No joke, the best Middle Eastern fare I've eaten in Los Angeles my entire life for 40 years. The ELF family has hit the falafel on the pita. Words pale to the flavors ready to be consumed here.</Review>

10/10 would recommend. I got the chicken platter, so delicious! The chicken wasn't dry and had flavor. The hummus was amazing. My husband ordered falafel and we were so amazed by how well it was made! Best we've had in a long time. Lemonade was good. It's a smaller place, seats are limited. I think they had 6 tables (and a bar stool area by the window). Not toddler friendly if you're dining in. No highchair and it's a tight space If you're traveling with a bulky stroller (luckily ours is foldable). We will definitely be back here 🙂<//review>

It's a perfect slice of LA meets Brooklyn. The food is concise and epic. Eat the green sauce and try the yellow. I don't know what the yellow is but I haven't had it anywhere else in North America.</Text>

It was juicy, good crispiness, good ratio of chicken and arugula with sliced radishes, and that hummus they spread on it. Eating this made me wonder why I haven't been back here as often as I should! Service was good. Cashier was busy with a call-in order, but she apologized for making me wait (it was only 5 minutes), but it was nice of her for being considerate! I love this place. Great service.< /review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNjD7KaYnmJrQa9K4W7-oWe0R3HxOUXglth55XV=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

Amazing mediterranean food. I think better to eat in or pick up than get delivered, it doesn’t transport that well! They have odd opening hours though. it really is some of the best food of this kind though.</Review>

<Review>Excited to try the downtown location so stopped by for lunch and was met with a locked building and this sign. Their website and googlemaps still shows the location as open. Extremely frustrating to journey from one end of downtown to the other on a limited lunch break to find the restaurant closed with no planned future opening. For all I know it is permanently closed.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPR-JBzJRi9JcoJINFc0IH50dTSr1ndcFWRjyih=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c7cbc7fede2d:0x94a55550c5f76d0c< /gmap_id></record>

Great tasting food had the fried chicken shawarma and Lamb sandwich both were delicious. Ingredients were fresh and tasty 👌😋....would definitely recommend the fried Chicken shawarma for inexperienced eater's who have never tried different types of culture food's or afraid to get out of there confert zone.< /Text>

Two words describe this place fried chicken shawarma with oddly southern ambiance. Cozy efficient kitchen with bar seating and 4 tables or so. Delicious<//review>

<text>This place is amazing! The sandwiches are exceptional, the meat is cut fresh for you on the spot, the ingredients are all fresh and crisp. The staff are lovely! Everybody is super cool and super nice. And now they have this new guy with super wild hair and feather earrings he was super sexy and I’m going to return just for him! But the sandwiches are already bomb! I highly recommend this place!</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Wife and I came and got a tuna on wheat and a Philly on Jalapeno bread. Both were excellent, fresh, made quickly and tasted great. I really appreciate how good the bread tastes. Employees were extremely friendly and the whole place was very clean. Give them a shot you won't be disappointed. Sandwiches are between 8-14$ depending on size and type.<//Review>

Oh my gosh! The tuna on squaw bread is incredible, with sprouts, double cucumber, lettuce, tomato, onion, light mayo/mustard, salt/pepper, oil/vinegar...

My new favorite!</Review>

Well, I mean it's fresh and clean, food is great quality flavour is right, but I'm not sure if any place I have ever been can be skimpier than these guys with EVERYTHING. If you wantva sandwich with barely anything on it, that does taste great, go here. If you want a sandwich pilled high that tastes great, go somewhere else. 1 star for cleanliness and 1 for freshness.< /text>

Subway has disappointingly skinny subs nowadays, but not submarinas.

The staff are all quite friendly, and the options are good.

I usually get a Box Lunch Special because I can eat the 4 inch sub before my lunch break is over, and it includes cookies and chips. You can get a drink with it but it costs a bit extra.

Definitely a good pick if you're looking for a good sub place.

They also offer salads and soups, but I have never tried them.<//Review>

Coffee machine is always down. Bathrooms are clean for the most part. Need to be consistent when opening for morning commuters. It is in a great location for business...<//Text>< pics>

Have grown up with this quaint and special location. Have seen many changes, however the changes also pay respect to the past as well. Especially love how the trains pass through and even stop sometimes.

The new updated Nipton doesn’t disappoint. It has been the stopping point for many many MANY years. People are always friendly.
Sadly, COVID-19 took its toll and the little town is looking for a hero. Hoping to see it open soon, bringing back the “yesterday” and move on to tomorrow like the amazing town it truly is!<//Review>

Lovely, quaint, and historical small town; unfortunately still mostly closed off (access inside the buildings like the Trading Post) to the public as of early September 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. However, you can still walk around and appreciate the frontier atmosphere and structures/artwork from the outside. Very friendly locals. Driving here is best done via Highway 95 (Searchlight, NV route).< /Text>

Greeted by a strange man wearing a coyote pelt as a hat. Still a nice little town if you ignore the profligates crucified along the street.< /text>

Lovely little town! Vulpes Inculta suggested us this place as a getaway from all those noisy profligates, and we were not disappointed. Feels like being back home in Arizona, with all the burning crosses and fun! Ave Caesar.<//Text>

I really liked this place, it's so different and unique. The tipi's are huge inside and the beds are so comfy. The food at the restaurant is good and the owner id's great. The only reason I missed a star off is because the tipi's are right next to a railroad and it was quite loud. There are however, some ear buds provided in the room should you be a light sleeper.<//text>

Great place to stop by if you are in the area. This is a nice very small town with one trading post, a restaurant (seasonal) and some eco cabin. Local community is giving its best to make it an original and welcoming place.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>What a pleasant sojourn! Situated on the northern edge of the Mojave National Preserve, Nipton is a quirky historical landmark, where you can grab a beer and fries, sit in the shade, and watch the trains go by. On a motorcycle or in a car, it's a short trip from southern NV. You might not intend to go to Nipton, but you'll be glad when you end up there.</Text>< Pics>

Drove through in the middle of the night. Cool old world theme with a giant octopus out front. I would have loved to be here when it was open. Saving to go back.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Located just a... 15 minute drive East of Interstate 15, this little place is just plain cozy. We visited Nipton on a driving whim/ adventure day. Once we arrived, we pulled into the trading post under a tree where there was some conveniently placed picnic table. The views are breath taking and just across from the picnic tables is a little drive/ walk area to check out the what seemed like some art out in the desert.
Our next trip, we would love to try out a cabin or one of the tee pees and just enjoy the relaxing environment.
Can't wait to visit again soon!< /text>< Pics>

I was on my way to Vegas, had to take a detour due to some deathclaws. I ended up going through this town and I must say, it must have been nice before everyone was nailed to a cross. 10/10 would hang again.< /review>

Very cool spot close to Las Vegas. It has a mart there and a bar/restaurant. They have a hotel, cabins and camping areas. They have teepees there which have beds and power, but no heating or air conditioning. There is also RV hook ups there as well. Some very nice views from there of the desert. Good place for fun and not too far a drive. They have artistic welding projects there too which is pretty cool.</review>

I've found it to be quite interesting however I've never had a reason to stop (always kind of scared for some reason). Now that the Bud Industry will be making its home in Nipton, my husband and I will definitely explore the town and I know I wouldn't be scared to stop in. Very exciting!</Review>< Resp>

Cute little historic town. Fairly busy pit stop for travelers to get out & stretch their legs & explore what used to be a train depot. There's a trading post that sells snacks, drinks, local raw honey, decorative candles, woven southwestern blankets, decorative glass,  souvenirs, books about the Mojave Desert, etc., & is a museum displaying old train depot items & serves as the front desk for checking into the hotel & other accommodations. There's also a cafe next to the trading post where you can purchase a glass of ice cold beer & dine/drink on the outdoor patio/deck & relax, soak up some sun & enjoy the breeze & scenic beauty of the desert & mountains & watch the freight trains pass by quite fast.. Next to the cafe is a small hotel for travelers. There's a small area near the hotel to pitch your tent if you prefer to camp for a small fee. There's a large open area out back with several large nicely furnished teepees with air condition  as well as cabins with air condition are available for travelers with reasonable nightly rates. We're told you have to book online & that they get booked pretty fast. There's a trail that takes you around the perimeter of the large open area where you can view several tall, interesting sculptures. Thoroughly enjoyed our 1 hour pit stop at Magical Nipton. Will definitely be back to stay overnight in one of the teepees,  dine outdoors at the cafe,  sit by the campfire not far from the teepee & enjoy the night sky.</review>

<text>The hotel is lovely for small groups and couples, if you like laid back car camping the cabins and tipi’s are perfect, it’s winter now and we awoke to light snow in the early morning, a getaway from the world, highly recommend you make your getaway here, the ‘Dutchman’ will be a lasting memory< /text>< pictures>

<review>It's a real town with old building that are not occupied, but good for photos. Some building you can eat and buy stuff. You have to slow down for the railroad (25 mph) anyways, so it's a good idea to take a quick photo, eat, restroom and buy snacks for the road.< /review>< Response>

These gents (Eric, Raul and the gang) do great beard trimming as well as fine styling and they have already earned a HUGE following after a relatively short time in biz .. they're also V E R Y forgiving [I've blown half-a-dozen appointments in the last year], making it convenient for ME to reschedule my biweekly beard-trim quickly .. and Raul IS the 10-o'clock shadow shave master!! Rock on, UBS.< /review>

I came into Uptown Barber Shop because of a emergency hair situation. I didn't have an appointment, but I had arrived early and within fifteen minutes, was able to have Robert work on my hair. He's a super friendly guy, did a FANTASTIC job, and the price was very reasonable. As a side note, I'm a lady who has sported various iterations of a fade for the majority of my adult life. Entering barber shops can sometimes be a bit intimidating and uncomfortable, but here, you'll be treated with friendly service and competence. Highly recommended!</review>

One of kind. A great place to get your fade done right. The guys are very skilled and provide excellent customer service. Has a pool table and you watch TV while getting your haircut.< /text>

<Review>Cool course but not great on a hot day. Make sure you have your own quiver since there aren't any. There are multiple to hang your bow and a decent amount of shade on the south half of the course. I like that the yardage is noted at each station with game rules if you want to follow. Plenty of scenarios for all skill levels as well as a couple of places to sight in. That hike up the hill sucks if you forgot something in your car but the honor code system is nice. I like that they keep the place fairly kept for being unmanned. Portable toilets available by the storage area if you need.<//Review>< username>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Text>First time.  Been wanting to go since I was 22.  Today is my 39th birthday.  Epic, enjoyed  being able to change distance at whim.  I will be back for sure.  Just got my bow in March.  Still need to try the "golf course" but it was in the 90s today and I didn't have my hiking shoes.  Thanks EDH Bowmen for a truly one of a kind archery range.<//Text>< Pics>

<review>The course and the targets were very well maintained. There Was an explanation plaque at each Target on the course that told me exactly what to do depending on whether I was shooting target or shooting "hunting"  the entire facility was well maintained and clean. And it had bathrooms that were accessible maintained and clean. Overall a fantastically nice experience :-) :-) :-) and only five bucks for a non-member :-) :-) :-)< /review><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

<text>Seems well taken care of and I like the amount of of targets there. 28 targets on a circuit with multiple targets at most stations. There's also a 30-80 yard right in range and a couple other shorter ranges that would be good for the kids.</text>< name>

Two 14 station target loops and two sight-in ranges, one 20 yard and one 30-80 yard. Everything is well maintained and clean.< /text>

Great spot to get some practice in with many different distances.  Standard range style near the club house, or walk around the place and there are stations similar to golfing.< /review>

<Review>This is a well stocked and friendly neighborhood market. The produce was fresh and they had all the essentials. You do need to look for items, but the fellow at the counter was very helpful. They even have a lunch counter with sandwiches. This is a fun and friendly place to shop.</Review>< time>

<text>It's basically a mini grocery store. You will find a lot, just not everything, so don't get mad if they don't carry... say saffron.
It's perfect for those last minute necessities and impulse buys...e.g. wake up in the morning and realize you are out of milk OR wake up and decide you want a donut with your coffee, without going too fancy on your wallet.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Great spot for all the basics and friendly staff! Since this market meets the needs of most things I’m looking for I pop in every time I’m in the area. I always appreciate the friendly greeting from the people at the front and am happy to have this shop in the area!<//review>

I LOVE this place. It’s my home away from home. The family that runs this market is so friendly. Joe, Linda and Sam are usually the ones working when I pop in and they are extremely accommodating and the store has everything you need! I live right down the street and it is my go-to, one stop shop! Thank you all for keeping me fed, especially Joe, who is always offering to let me try his delicious food!<//Review>

Prices can be a bit higher than you might expect, but some items are spot on. Honestly you pay for the convenience, but it's worth not giving to hop in a car.</review>

<review>I bought 3 sandwiches from this deli and all three had the brownest avocado I have ever been served. It takes a lot to gross me out. Im usually very understanding but this was just gross. I would have much rather had them just tell me they were out of avocado. Ruined lunch for me and my family. Dont waste your money here unless your buying drinks or pre packaged food.<//review>< rating>

Got two sandwiches and both weren’t good. They are stingy on everything except the mustard. I agree about the rip off post. They charge extra for drinks and sandwiches. Wouldn’t recommend.</Review>

This place is great even though it's a bit pricey...they sell so many different items, especially for Someone who lives around here and especially on busy weekends. But the only issue is there is one lady at the counter who I have never had a good experience with...she is always extremely rude to me and makes me avoid this place like the plague because I don't want to deal with such terrible customer service.< /Text>

<Text>OBSCENELY expensive.

I was shocked that my total was $40 for the SAME ITEMS I could get at Ralphs for $25.

This place essentially exists to rip off visitors and tourists, so if possible, avoid at all costs.

If you MUST go here, walk into the nearby liquor store for slightly better prices.

For the owners: This is what happens when you charge unfair prices. Not only do you lose a customer, but we end up telling others (in person and online) to avoid your business, which, overtime ends up having the OPPOSITE effect you intended.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

Too expensive for no reason. The prices of the same products are 2-3 times higher than in a chain grocery stores like Safeway and Target. Selection is pretty basic and rather limited.</Text>

< review>
Visited mission beach and was staying at the Hyatt.  I was very glad to find mission market.  He had everything I needed - water, groceries, staples, wine, even disposable champagne flutes (which I was looking for and didn't expect to find).  Owner was great and has been there 30+ years.  Better than a CVS (minus the pharmacy) and much less expensive.<//review>

<Review>One of the South Mission originals and a staple in the community.  Joe always has wisdom to keep you in check and share a laugh.
Be good and keep dropping the knowledge on those during their tour of duty in SoMis.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I am a local market connoisseur in that I love small mom and pop shops that put pride in their business. This is absolutely one of those places. You know - The kinda place that if you are 10 cents shorts they will just tell you to get them back next time. They somehow remember, recognize and give the benefit of the doubt to each and every customer. My sailboat is moored on a ball right on the back side of this market in Mission Bay so I go there for a lot of my supplies and they always have it all. Thanks for providing a great service to your community. Great beer selection also with lots of cooler doors with all kinds of beverages for a warm day at the beach.<//Text>< pictures>

Has all the necessities, but definitely overpriced. We walked out with a small bag of groceries (like four things) for $17.<//text>

When I got there at the drive-thru window, I was told the restaurant was closed by an automated voice. That would be fine, but I already paid for my food.

I had the chicken, bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich and homestyle potaotes.  YUMMY!  The signage is not consistent with the price I was charged (see pics).  The cashier inforned me that the homestyle potatoes are an upcharge even though the sign lists them as an option for the combo (you'll see that the chilled coffee is an upcharge, nothing noted on the sides).  There is an almost constant stream of homeless people in/out using the bathroom, refilling cups (none of which were from JIntB), and taking sauce packets....not blaming JintB, just a note.</review>< GmapID>

Surprisingly, the drive thru wasn't too backed up. I was third in line. When I rolled to the order box, the person on the other end, taking my order had an upbeat attitude and listened for each item carefully. He also had good follow up questions.
When I got to the window, the young man took my payment and he had a helper with him. They passed me my order very quickly. I hardly had to wait. Everything on the order was correct.
Thing of note: They do have signage asking you to wear your mask at the window, bravo!
However, it does not seem that their employees are practicing social distancing in their workplace.</Text>

<Review>I went to Jack In The Box today and got home with the food. One of the items I bought was the tater tots cheese and bacon. It's a special they have going on right now. The tater tots were so hard and so old that I couldn't even chew them. I've been trying to call Jack in the Box for the last hour and a half and the phone keeps ringing and ringing. Jack in the Box is a little pricey and it sure would be nice to receive a fresh meal< /Review><user>110510018383346807346<//user></record></dataset><record>

<text>Chicken Cluck Combo is very good for a limited time. Suggest you get it, it's worth a try. The Deluxe is tasty, but messy. If you like mayo, guac, bacon, ice burg lettuce, tomatoes & real cheddar cheese, then go for it!< /text>< user>

I'm a number 28 type of guy. I go by this particular establishment because it's right off the freeway after I get off work.
The morning crew is young, very respectful & my food is always served to me hot & fresh.
Great service & they're relatively fast.< /Review>

<Review>Order two bacon double cheese burgers Saturday evening  (5/29/2021), went home to find out there was no bacon.  The employees were acting shady and laughing, they were also very unprofessional. Wish I've gone next door for a burrito.<//Review>< rating>

<Review>As far as Jack in the Box goes, this is middle of the road. What gives that 4th star is a young man that works the drive-thru.... he seems to enjoy his job and that positive energy comes thru the speaker. I love when he is working the drive thru. Puts a smile on my face.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

I wind up driving to another local location for my shake. (They probably close up the mixer for their closing shift and we loose out). 3 stars only because they are very polite during the day.< /Review>< pics>

I had a very upsetting experience at this location last night. My husband always uses the app to put in an order. So his name shows. My husband is Nigerian. When we got to the window we heard a lady in the background saying his first name followed by noises obviously making fun of his Nigerian last name. He was very upset. That was very unprofessional & offensive behavior.<//Text>

This place is my number one place.  Of all restaurants I know I prefere it most. I always suggests to my friends to go to that place. Whenever  I I need a good lunchon, this restaurant comes straight to my head. splendid and   food and a large list of dishes.trained staff, and nice mood. Also important, the bill is affordable. I sent my friends to this restaurant with pleasure.<//Review>

This place is an all around mess. The employees seem to get annoyed when making simple requests about how you’d like an order prepared, they argue with you when bringing back an item that wasn’t prepared to the specifications that are clearly marked on your receipt. I’ve yet to have a positive experience any of the times I’ve been here and my most recent trip will most definitely be the last.<//text>

Good food as usual. However, the restroom was filthy and several of the local homeless were hanging around my car when I tried to leave. Not a very safe neighborhood.</Review>

It really depends on which Jack in the Box you go to for the food to be eatable. Not all are good. The one on Hillcrest has never let me down. The one on Lone Tree by Wal-Mart should be shut down. It was awful and the one on California Ave. Is just ok.< /text>

Great place for burgers that competes for the second spot on my favorite list next to burger king. But it can't top Fuddruckers.<//review>

He told me the total and was like YEEE. I swear I felt home.

I also get a keto burger and they always confirm what I want on it. They make the drive through fun. Yeeeeee!<//Text>< resp>

A total bunch of Idiots. DRIVE TO BURGER KING DOWN THE STREET! They never get my order right here. And my burger was made so sloppy I can’t even eat it. Plus they forgot my curly fries all together. GO ANYWHERE ELSE! They don’t even deserve the 1 star.</review>

<text>Only ever been here twice, but second time in a row to be missing half the order. No reciept today either- I probablly should have paid more attention. The dude jumping at my open window to demand money at the exit of the drive thru was a nice touch too... "Yo' give me a dollar for some tacos!"

Skipping this location from now on.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Review>Waited in line & person in front of me already done ordering but it seems like the manager is more interested in talking to him than taking my order.  What made it worse was he turned his attention to another woman to answer her question then went back talking.

<Text>I would rate this jitb a 0 if I could! I usually go to the one on California and loveridge with no problems, I only go to the one on railroad when I absolutely have too! Every time I go they screw up my order, so tonight I go cause it's closer to my house and I had a simple order (3 sausage croissants 2 with no egg 1 regular and bacon cheddar wedges!) but they still found a way to screw it up not only did I not get what ordered but I was also over charged! I never call and complain cause it's not worth it but tonight I did, after minutes and minutes of ringing with no answer I gave up! If you live in Pittsburg I recommend driving the extra couple minutes and go to the one on California!<//Text>< name>
