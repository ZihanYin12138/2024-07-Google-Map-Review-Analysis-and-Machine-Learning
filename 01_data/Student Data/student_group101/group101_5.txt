Called and jumped through "robohoops" for 20 minutes only to get a message that all agents are busy and got hung up automatically.  No callback or wait-in-line feature.  It's clear this bureaucratic division of the government has no respect other people's time.< /text>

Stopped by to grab an application for the 66 year old homeless man who lives behind my house. Apparently, you are expected to wait in a 40-minute line for a blank application. I guess nobody cares enough about customer service to make them available by the front door.

UPDATE: Glad I didn't wait in line. I checked the SS website for a printable form for my homeless neighbor to fill out AND THERE ISN'T ONE, just an online application. I guess old homeless people are expected to have computers. FAIL< /text>

I went around 1 the line was not that bad like a 10 minute wait. It's like the airport so you have to empty your pockets and take off your belt then go through a metal detector. For my SS replacement a ID or driver's ID is enough to get it mailed.</text>

<Text>Went there without an appt to request a new ss card due to name change and was pleasantly surprised at the staff efficiency. Although I helped within 30 minutes, it was clear some requests have a longer wait. Make sure you have all needed documents required for the transaction you are processing. Also, since this is a federal building they check your personal items and all customers must go through a metal detector before entering.<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80dd33e27551f4d5:0x92a9103a4ae8ae5f<//gmap_id></record>

<text>I was here on Tuesday right a 9:00. The line already had 20 people waiting. We waited two hours in the hot sun, no shade, and no seating provided. There were children in the group (2 & 4 year olds crying). When I finally got in, there were over 30 empty chairs in the nice air-conditioned waiting room. Why did they make us wait 2 hours in the hot sun?</text>< user_name>

I spent around an hr and 30min here WITHOUT an appt. I consider that fast since this is a government office, got there at 9:05 there was a long line already but was running fast and got out of there at 10:30, the staff is very kind and professional I was even assisted in my native language (Spanish) which made me feel very comfortable. I felt very satisfied with the service.</Text>

I arrived at the location as did several other people to find the office closed at 2PM today.  Very upsetting to drive there and the doors to be locked at 2PM and a security guard roaming around inside not able to give us a answer to why it was closed today.
Was it a holiday, staff meeting or what?<//text>

Long lines, especially in the morning between 9am and 12pm. Actually, there is people waiting in line before they open. Avoid the long lines by using their online services.</Text>

I made an appointment for them to call me at work. I never got the call when it was supposed to come. I found out afterward that they left a message on my home phone.< /text>

< Review>
The website stated that the long beach office was open today, Wednesday until 3:30. I arrived  at 1:30  and the office closed at noon. Typical government malfunction and a very short work  day.< /Review>

<rate>4< /rate><Review>(Translated by Google) The location is actually at Long Beach, why are government offices in the United States so scattered. You have to go through security check, queue up to get the number or make an appointment in advance. But the queue was quite fast, and it was my turn soon.

(Original)
位置居然在long beach，为什么美国的政府办公楼都是这么分散。进去还得安检，排队拿号或提前预约。不过排队排的还挺快，很快就轮到我。<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80dd33e27551f4d5:0x92a9103a4ae8ae5f< /GmapID></record>

We arrived 40 minutes before they closed and they had already shut down the beer taps and made us get our pizza to go because it was too close to closing. I remember working fast food in high school and we could not shut anything down out start cleaning until closing time! Not 40 minutes before hand!< /review>

Made an online order at 8:03 and was informed that my pizza would be ready in 90min. Got there at 9:30pm only to be told "Your pizza is missing". Maria G. Was sure she cut it right before a coworker's break but now its missing. As I'm being refunded I was told " your pizza's not here, the oven's are off so here's your money back, IT'S OK". Smh POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE, I would love for Round table to explain how thats ok to my kids that waited over an hour for a pizza they where never going to see.</Text>

So it looks like I may be the first to actually review this site. And I'll be honest it is very nice inside more spacious then I originally thought. The service was okay as I was ordering takeout they finished my food in a timely fashion. But the garlic twists were under cooked and didn't have the same flavor I know and love about them from other locations. The pizza was cooked but there was very little flavor and totally unexpected coming from a round table. I hope they can fix the seasonings because round table is known for great ingredients with lots of awesome flavor. 3 stars for the facility 0 stars for the taste.  They aught to fix the value of the product to compete with mountain Mike's across the street. Good luck guys hope you get it together quick, you just opened.< /review>

< Review>
Called at around 1:50 to make an order they told me in 20 minutes it will be ready. Showed up at 2:20 but was told it will be another 10 mins but if we would like to pay now so we did. they said once it was ready they would take it to our car. we waited for 30 minutes and NOTHING. So went inside to see why they were taking so long, the workers were just talking and doin NOTHING. They were so into their gossip that they forgot they had ppl waiting outside for their orders. never had a problem until now these girls need to get on it!</Review>

<Text>Called in a order to Round Table pizza in Patterson. The last 3 times when I get there to pick up my order it's no where to be found.Today I purposely CALLED in instead of online. The girl said order would be ready in 30 minutes. I get there about 35 mins later my order was NO where to be found. They didn't have a Single order in the waiting to be picked up. Not a single person waiting for food. When I told them I was picking up my order. I heard the girl ask where the order was...no one knew... she tells me mamm it will be a few minutes.. I said you lost my order. She said YES... I Said this is the 3rd time.. not Once a apology.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK. think they are Making themselves Free food... I have message Corporate and have reported on their Facebook page.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1589197041691, 'text': 'Vickey, we appreciate you bringing this to our attention.

<Review>I'm putting 4 stars because the self serve beer dispenser wasn't working and or stocked.its not like you can check before you purchase the self serve beer, so I was disappointed that they didn't inform me and when I didn't get the beer I wanted and my girl didn't get the wine she wanted. Other then that it was nice staff did alright as well.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>1 month after opening. Self serving beer is really great! At the moment this place is very unorganized with staff. Pizza took 40 minutes to come out correct.  They asked for our receipts 3 times to check on our orders. They came out with the wrong pizzas 3 times. They were not rude just slow to deliver and seemingly unorganized. They did apologize with an extra pizza for free. I hope that they will soon fix the problems.< /Review>< pictures>

Ordered a pizza 35 minutes in advance over the phone. Gave them my phone number, name and order. They gave me the price. Went in 35 minutes later and they had no record of my order. They suggested that I called the wrong Round table. Showed them the number I called off of my cell phone. They confirmed that I called the right number. Reordered and the price was now different? They told me they would expedite it. Took another 35 minutes.  Its a new place. I understand. But taking customer orders and charging the right amount are the absolute basics of a restaurant business. Nice new place 👍. Service out of the gate is as bad as it gets. I'll stick with Mountain Mikes for now. I'll try again in a few months.<//text>

<review>For a newly opened business this place is really busy. If you're dining in, order ahead of time so you can avoid the wait. Pizza is always great, I just wish they could put more pepperoni on it.< /review>< UserId.>

<Text>My zowie that is from Maui, pizza, tasted as though it was from King Arthur's circle pizza making table back in 1959. Cooked just right, all the ingredients at the just perfect ratio.

The beer is wonderful, tap is cold and ready to serve on demand. 20 different taps to choose from, as much as I want to buy. Way to go. Also a lot from dustbowl, keeping it local...</Text><gmap_id>0x8091b36ead35fe3f:0xf622e2c7b4f09440</gmap_id>< user_name>

Saturday appointments and free battery check was awesome! After my oil change, they let me know what might be another car issue I might want to attend to next (a tune-up), but I did not feel any pressure to commit to it immediately, as I do with other car shops.  With my appointment, they estimated an hour for it to be finished, and they finished with extra time to spare.  They were great!< /text>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I went in to get my oil changed because I saw a commercial on TV. It turned out I did not qualify for that coupon because my car takes full synthetic. However the employees were incredibly kind and patient and the business was very clean for being a mechanic place. I waited and walked around the neighborhood for about half an hour. It's a lovely neighborhood and I will absolutely be using this place again.<//Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

<Review>they disassembled my brake system, and said that they could only work tomorrow, I urgently needed a car, I make urgent delivery, the worker was very agressive, one more time I wanted call to police. Employees work with other cars and we lost a lot of time and nerves. Necessary was just change the pads but we got more problems.

I don't have a car so I never actually went in meineke's but I like going there to smoke on their steps nobody bothers me so if you live in Little Italy area of San Luis Obispo and you need a safe place to smoke I highly recommend the steps on the far side of meineke<//Text>

The guys were helpful and great. I just stopped by and said if they could evaluate my car before a big trip, in 10 minutes they told me I had an engine misfire. By the end of the day they figured it out and found a cheap and effective solution to my problem. Perfect!< /review>

Meineke did an inspection of a used vehicle for me before purchase. They were in depth, and even sent me a comprehensive summary with pictures and explanations of what they found. They were easy to communicate with, and stopped me from buying a car that had sever issues hidden by the dealer. I would easily reccomend them to anyone. Their inspection is a bit pricey, but in my case was absolutely worth it.< /Text>

I was very happy. This was my first time at Meineke and I had only bought the car a week ago when the „Check Engine“ light came on. I was greeted very friendly and was explained up front what to expect. They just did the diagnostic, shared the findings with me and didn’t try to sell me on anything. Very professional and very kind. I will definitely go back.< /Text>

<text>We needed to get the front end of out 2007 Toyota Camaery fixed before our move to Texas and technicians at Meineke did a amazing and quality job in the limited time available.  Sergio at the front desk was nothing but professional and kind. They even fixed the brake calipers, adding a missing bolt that the last shop,which I will not speak of didn't tell us they lost! The owner was quick and responsive to all questions and very easy to work with. I highly recommend there services.< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><user>110354949124735933992< /user>< Date>

Joseph was very friendly and accommodating. While I was there I watched him deal with a rude, unreasonable customer. Instead of getting upset, Joseph was very patient and deescalated the situation. The mechanic finished the maintenance on my Civic far ahead of schedule. Prices are reasonable, and the management even offers coffee, wifi, and cable for customers to enjoy. I will definitely come back to get both of my vehicles serviced here from now on!<//Text>

<Text>I was the driver of a 2nd vehicle on a scheduled 2-fer for a friend of mine.  The transaction was handled well and the work (2 oil changes, please) was turned around in a very reasonable duration of time.  The wait area is nice and comfortable, the view outside where the air is fresh and the blocks are walkable . . . is "SLO cozy", . . . and a nice assortment of local flavor did also entreat the lobby for chat with the Ops Captain du jour (or every day, i dunno, but THIS day THAT cat was doing well with the walk-ins).  I even enjoyed the co-presence of a dude who came in to restock the wiper-blade kiosk in the lobby.  Good visit, good service, and i am told also good price.<//Text>< Name>

<Text>When I arrived, no one greeted me. I had an appointment, but had to go search around for an employee. None of the employees I saw wore masks, gloves, or participated in any cleanliness measures. I was quoted $27 for the oil changed, but they made a mistake on the quote and switched the cost to $70 without asking. They were supposed to call me when they were finished while I waited nearby. After an hour went by, no phone call. I went back. My car was done. No one was around again - when I found someone, I also found out about the increase in price. I was late to my next meeting, felt ripped off, and had received very poor customer service. I can't tell if the oil quality is good or not or if they performed the job well. But everything else was awful.<//Text>< Rate>

Please save your time and money.
I talked to the owner Richard before getting work done.
He seemed nice, but that was the only thing nice.
45 minutes to check in thr car.
They put other cars as priority, didn't tell me any diagnostics before or after.
Was not ready twice when I arrived to pick up.
No pick up courtesy call.
Got unsold on my oil change.
What a nightmare
Then after I had already picked up my car, the next day I got a call that its ready.

This place is horrible.

<review>...This experience was from a previous owner in June 2020.... unable to remove the AD; but updated the star-rating.

Went in for an A/C evaluation, after having a poor experience at another auto shop.  Was told the diagnosis was actually simple enough to resolve, and scheduled me to come back the next day.  The owner had me arrive at 8am the next day, but the mechanic who evaluated the issue wasn't there.

After waiting for over an hour, was told he found the part but it would be over $500 (and this was, supposedly, without confirming with his mechanic).  Said he would search for a cheaper part, and that he would get back to me.  I left and researched the issue online and visited an O'Reilly Auto store, and found the parts for a lot cheaper.  When I reached back out, two times later, he finally said mechanic supposedly never showed up.

Waste my time.</review><Resp>{'time': 1592662077385, 'text': "Hi There, sorry about that experience. That manager is no longer with the company. If you feel like it give us another try.

I made an appointment for an oil change, vehicle inspection and tire rotation. I arrived on time the day of my appointment and told they could not perform the work that day. After having to listen to the new manager’s problems, I made an appointment for the following week. I arrived early and patiently waited while two customers were complying to the manager for giving him one price and then charging them more. I was finally allowed to check in 50 minutes later than my appointment time. I came back 70 minutes later and after 15 more minutes I paid, after the manager rectified my bill, and left. I have been bringing my cars to this Meineke location for 9 years and had major repairs made to my satisfaction, spending over $9000, (the most recent expense being nearly $3000, which was money well spent) with your company. I am torn about returning to Meineke again, but I am hesitant to use Meineke again with the current staff.</review>

More communication would be helpful.
When completed I asked if any problems then told the air filter dirty do I want another? Maybe ask when discovering it to get what is needed at that time so not to wait 30 + minutes after "completing" the 60 minute work.<//text>

My Meineke experience was fantastic. The location was clean and had a great waiting area that made me feel comfortable. The owner was at the desk taking care of me and informed me what to keep an eye on and what to fix based on safety concerns. He was professional and concerned for my safety and reliability of my car in these concerning times of COVID quarantine.< /Review>

I really appreciated their ability to ease my stress about my car’s dead battery. They made me laugh about the situation rather than stew in the issues about my car. They were incredibly cooperative, informational, and all around kind towards my situation. Hopefully I won’t be back too soon but if I do have a future issue, I will for sure go back to them for help!< /review>

Been going here for several years now as they have good coupons for oil changes and I’ve always been happy with the service. However my experience yesterday was not so great. Had an appointment at 10:00am for an oil change and was told there was no one ahead of me so they would get started right away. There was a new person training - which I get that there’s a learning curve being in management myself. The new employee was eating a donut as he was trying help me...and I had to repeat my information to him several times before it was correct. Other customers came in after me with appointments as well and they were all having complaints about things taking long. Usually it’s about 45-60 minutes that I wait. And yesterday I was sitting there waiting for my oil change for 2 hours! Not sure why this was when there apparently wasn’t anyone ahead of me. Not sure if I’ll go back again or not.<//text>

We were on the road just driving through San Luis Obispo when our AC unit went out. We looked up on line where we could get it fixed quickly. Meineke popped up. The front guy SGR, that’s the only identity I could find on receipt, helped and took our car in right away. He found the problem and fixed it for us immediately. It all took less than an hour. Now our AC is working great, and drive through the hot summer spots on our road trip.<//text>

I specifically asked for the oil change to use conv oil not synthetic. I know he understood because he asked why not. I replied because the car doesn’t need syn oil so I don’t want to pay for syn oil. Just use conv. I also needed an alignment And asked for a 4 wheel alignment because we just replaced all four tires. After waiting an hour longer than told they put in syn oil and we got a two wheel alignment. With a guy sitting there with his hat on backwards and a couldn’t give a s—t attitude i chose to just pay the bill and leave never to return. We had good luck with meineke in Anchorage with my daughters car there. But in SLO I would look elsewhere. I did not have any issues with the technician or their work. Will go elsewhere for car mtc.</text>

During my scheduled oil change and car inspection yesterday a man at the desk suggested that I go over the inspection report “with my dad, uncle or boyfriend so they can help me understand it”. This was an extremely condescending thing to tell a young woman— especially one who is about to finish her mechanical engineering degree at Cal Poly. Please take time to educate your workers that women are capable of understanding technical concepts.</review>< pictures>

I’ve been coming here for a few months and service is always prompt and am only waiting about 30 min. Yesterday my experience was awful though. I came in at my appointment time and the guy could not find my information even though I’ve been there several times, he seemed to have no idea what he was doing. Then I proceeded to wait 2 HOURS for my car to be done. I told the guy I’d been waiting that long and how much longer it’d be. He said oh sorry I’ll get it right now. Then continued to sit at his desk for 15 more minutes. Bummed cause I liked this place but I’m not sure I’ll be back< /Text>

<review>I would not recommend bringing your car here. I have taken my car here probably ten times to take advantage of their $20 oil change coupons but had terrible experiences the last two times and have decided that coming here is not worth the few bucks I have been saving.  First off, every time I come in I have had an appointment, but somehow it takes over an hour to get my oil changed. The last time I got my oil changed they notified me that at my next service I should replace my air filter, hoses, all fluids, brakes and tires.  I thought that was odd as my car was fairly new(3 years old).  Today's oil change my car has miraculously gone from falling apart to the best maintained vehicle they have seen(I changed my air filter but didn't touch anything else). I don't know if the difference in reports is from a sheisty mechanic or an incompetent one, either way, I will not be coming back! If anyone knows of a good place in town to get oil changes, please let me know.< /review><gmap_id>0x80ecf0e3a70c5823:0xddfca7f1bd884626</gmap_id><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNv2qx2aFz7ZvkC52-VvMdi8EiWXns9nYP-wIrL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< Resp>

<user>108380413542302425928< /user><text>They totally ripped me off after I was forced to tow there. They quoted me $700 for literally just a battery change, and when I asked about a breakdown of that cost, they didn’t have an answer and said their computer “just spits out a number” and they lowered it to $480. Even then it was a terrible price. They charged a $150 installation fee that Autozone and most other place do for free, and charged $225 for a diagnostic that the guy specifically told me would be $150. Clearly they were trying to take advantage of my (college) age and situation. Wouldn’t recommend.</text>< name>

I had been a customer with Meineke here in San Luis Obispo for 5 years, without any issues or problems. I had always felt their prices to be reasonable and treatment of me as a customer fair. That all changed on December 19th. I made an appointment for my rear brakes to be replaced and an oil change. Dropped the car off at 9am and asked when it would be ready. I was told by Richard (the owner) that he expected the work to be completed between 12:30 -1:00 pm. I was at lunch and called in between that timeframe to ask how my car was coming along. I was told the work hadn't been done yet as the parts weren't available in SLO. Richard did not realize my 1996 Toyota Corolla had drum cylinders in the back. Did not realize. Guess he was not able to look up required parts to a car that had an appointment 4 days in advance. I let it go. Finally I picked my car up after my shift at work, around 5:00 pm. I got in and immediately noticed a sort of clunking sound coming from the right rear, as though a part was hitting against the wheel or something. I drove cautiously and called first thing Friday morning on the 20th. Richard told me to bring the car in and that they would look into it. I got a call from a technician, Victor, a couple hours later. He stated he wasn't the mechanic that worked on my car the previous day, but he looked at the car and there didn't appear to be a problem. I ask Victor if he had driven the car, to hear the sound... he actually told me no. I told him to call me back after he drove my car. It became very apparent to me at this point that no one at Meineke has probably driven my car, not even a test drive on Thursday after replacing brakes! Who doesn't test drive a car after replacing brakes, or after a customer returns the following day complaining of a sound!? So, after that call I called my family mechanic. Explained what was going on and asked his opinion. He said that sound will happen when drum cylinders are not properly adjusted, as what I have has to be manually adjusted. I laughed because when I was on the phone with Victor at Meincke, he told me that the sound was probably due to my front brakes being bad. That I didn't notice it until I fixed my rear brakes. He even offered me a quote for the repair! Absurd. Victor went on to tell me that rear cylinders are manually adjusted and that they can sometimes be off. I asked if he was stating that was why my car was making the noise in the right rear. Victor told me no, it was the front brakes, after all they were at 4mm. So, I called and asked to speak with Richard the owner. I told Richard to be sure my car was off the rack and parked, I was on my way to pick it up. Suddenly, just miraculously, my car was not making a sound when I drove it off the lot. The sound I heard, as well as two other people. I just wanted them to admit a potential error on their part, instead I was made to feel incompetent and unknowing. I was offered a quote for further work, when I was clear that I was unhappy with work completed just the day before. I took my car to my family mechanic the next day, Saturday December 21st. He measured my front brakes, which were just between 7mm and 8mm, so that was a lie told to me by Meincke. Then we checked by tire pressure, set to 30 PSI is the factory suggestion. The first tire we checked was at 25! I doubt Meincke even checked my tires, and if they did obviously numbers aren't their best skill since there is a drastic difference between 4mm and 7mm-8mm. Then the fun part came where he went to check my right rear brakes. The drum was over-corrected. He needed to use bolts to remove it. It is my opinion that Meincke chose not to own up to their mistake, over-adjusted the drum to attempt to fix the issue without taking ownership, and then also lied to my face and on my report about other "issues" with my car. What a joke! Do not go to this shop. They were inconsiderate. They treated me with no dignity or respect. They had no compassion or understanding. And never did anybody apologize. NEVER. Way to lose a customer of 5 years Meincke.< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><text>I never really feel comfortable in auto shops but that changed today. My car was far past due for an oil change and I asked them to check on my transmission fluid too. I made an appt online which was really easy. I waited comfortably in their lobby eating candy and watching Batman. I definitely choked on a piece of candy and tried to play it cool...one of the technicians offered water and didn’t laugh which I appreciated.
I’ve read some reviews that said they try to upsale but I didn’t get that at all. First of all this is a place of business. All businesses upsale. My personal opinion is people only get offended at expensive recommendations when it’s something they actually need, they just don’t want to pay for it.  Like getting a crown at the dentist.
They wrote recommendations for me and gave me a choice to do it. I never felt any pressure and they explained it wasn’t a dire situation. My car feels great and I’m happy I found this spot.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

If you haven't been to Meineke recently, do yourself a favor and stop by! The new management there has turned this place into a 5-star car care center.  John has always been completely honest and upfront with the work- a very refreshing experience compared to other car centers I've dealt with in the past. The environment is clean and professional and it's comforting to know when my wife stops by, she is in a great place that will treat her well. Bottom line: One stop shop with top-notch service at the most reasonable rates around.</Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I am from San Marcos Ca and I had issues with my 1998 Ford Ranger. I had special plans on the weekend. I dropped my truck off while in San Luis Obispo Ca on Friday night. I spoke to Tim who worked on my truck all day Saturday. Tim went out of his way to make sure I had my truck back on Saturday evening so I could come home Sunday. Without the help of Tim I would have been stranded a bit. But Tim made the impossible possible. Even I was skeptical for a moment. But I drove home safe and sound on Sunday.
Thankyou Tim for everything you did and your guys did to make the magic happen to have my truck up and running again.
Thankyou so very much
I would recommend to anyone!</review>< Pictures>

This Car Care Center is the best ever...  This guys were Angels to me!! I had a car parked for 10 months.. that didn't want to start... they helped me pushing the car to the place.

Worst service ever. Tried to charge me for a rotor that did not need to be replaced on my brake job. The price was higher then what Ford told me it would be equal for equal. Would never go back and suggest you don't either. Vencenta ?? was who wrote my order up and who tried to take advantage of me a senior who served our country, so much for service for service men.<//review>

< Review>
Please do not make the mistake of taking your vehicle here like I did. The employees at Meineke are such conniving weasels. They will say anything to rob you. I have taken my car there twice. The first experience was no so well. I had made an appointment for a Saturday, and when I showed up, an employee told me that they were closing early, even though I had made this appointment online, and plenty in advance. The second time I had gone, although I should've took the first encounter as a red flag, they failed to align my tires, and they told me that the air filter was growing mold on a brand new car. I knew that they were just trying to finagle more money out of me. I had asked how much for the replacement , and they told me a flat $30. I did NOT agree to the replacement, I would have liked a second opinion, but the went ahead and replaced it anyway. When told how much it had made my simple trip for an oil change, instead of the $30 for the replacement in which I was quoted, it quickly changed to $75. All in all, they're a bunch of thieves, and there are many other places in which I should've gone to in the first place. I really hope to see Meineke out of business soon.< /Review>

<review>This place is fantastic! I've been going here to get my oil changes and all other car repairs for the last year and a half since I've lived in the central coast. I've had nothing but good experiences and the customer service is great. I've dealt mostly with Alex and AJ and both those guys are friendly and honest! Definitely would recommend this place, weather you're looking for a new car care center or just passing through and need a check up!</review>< pictures>

<review>My first google review, because that's how much my subaru and I love coming to Meineke! I have been going here since 2014, and they have always been able to give me good prices for my oil changes and other maintenance. Able to identify and solve problems quickly and well. Additionally, they are both informative and respectful, which is important as a college student (other shops I've gone to have been quick to try and take advantage of someone who doesn't know cars). Will definitely keep coming back!</review><Rating>5< /Rating>< name>

I've been going here regularly for a few years. The staff is super nice and accommodating. When I had some engine issues relating to the same problem they really worked with me on getting it in and not charging for labor when we had a few more issues with it. They have a nice points program that gives you points with each dollar spent that can towards oil changes and other services.</Text>

Got there at noon, AJ took immediate control and we were on the road in less than 45 minutes with very cold A/C  I cannot say enough how happy we are with this shop!
And the waiting room and bathroom are CLEAN!

Tires were not rotated as part of their 34.99 oil change, and instead of writing return back 232,303 miles, the little reminder oil change sticker read, "return back in 332,303."  The last part is not that big of a deal, I thought it was a bit careless, but the fact that my tires were not rotated was a let down.  I didn't notice this until later on in the day.  I have a cracked hubcap on my front passenger tire,  and the cracked hubcap was still on the tire located on the front passenger side of the car, indicating that my tires had not been rotated.  Had it been rotated that cracked hubcap would be on the rear of the car.  I used to like coming to this place, and there used to be an older man who used to work there who seemed to keep things moving smoothly at this Meineke, but I was told he had retired, and now it seems that retired worker has been replaced with some other workers who may not be as disciplined, or may not care to do a quality job.<//review>

<rate>1</rate><review>My young son brought his car in for a simple oil change.  Not only did they fail to put the oil cap back on making an awful mess of the engine compartment, but was given a bullsh#t list of "things that need to be done":
Amongst the items listed:
- Tires  (He had them replaced with new just two weeks before - elsewhere)
- Serpentine belt - (also replaced at the same time of the tires - elsewhere)
- Idler pulley - (Checked just fine when the serpentine belt was recently replaced)
- Brake pads and rotors - (Done less than 5,000 miles ago - elsewhere)
- Coolant smells acidic - ( also recently flushed and replaced)
- Leaking exhaust system - (Has never failed a smog check)

Obviously,the guy had no idea of the maintenance history, but this unscrupulous shop was going to drum up some easy revenue from a trusting, honest individual.  I seriously doubt  the oil was changed. Should you go here, hold tight to your wallet,- and check for your oil cap.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I went here for an oil change and I was there at 1 with an appointment and I didn't leave until almost 4 pm. It was the longest I have ever waited for my oil to be changed and the guy said they were "fully staffed". The worst part was when I left my car was shuttering and about a month later I took it into SM tire off of Grand ave and the mechanics there told me that they had put ever single one of my tires on wrong (which explained the shuttering). Not just one tire but all four. Worst experience I have ever had. When I called meinecke to bring it to there attention I had sent them multiple emails with attached pictures and I got no return phone call.<//review>< Pictures>

Got a synthetic oil change on my car here. I went to their old location where Lube N Go is now, and they wanted over $80 for the oil change. Google'd the new location and got it for $45 from Meineke.

New location is top super clean and twice the size of the old location.

Will be going back there from here on.<//Text>

<Text>This place is a scam. I went in for an oil change and. Was told  that I needed new tires. I agreed to them because he made it seem like it was a desperate situation.. Well I went on to pay for my oil change and he charged me 70 dollars, without telling me. I guess part of it was a deposit for the tires along with the cost of the oil change. He not once told me there was a deposit for tires.  And when i asked for a refund he told me its a non refundable fee. I asked to speak with a manager and guess what? He is the manager..  If a fee is unrefundable it seems like the customer should at least be aware that they are being charged and agree to the terms. That is not a good way to do business. I feel as if I wss ripped off. Don't go here.. You'll lose out in the end.< /Text>< user_id>

Staff just tried to work me, right from when I walked in the door. Derek is in it to make money for the boss. I worked in garages for years. Meineke did a brake job for me in Wichita Kansas, treated me great, but had some issues that needed to be fixed. Thought bringing it to another Meineke would be no big deal. Boy was I wrong!< /review>

Awful experience here. Scedulued an appointment. Showed up and it was going to take 2 hours for an oil change so I rescheduled later in the day. Returned to an even longer wait. Very unhappy. Look elsewhere for an oil change!<//text>

Not only did Meinke do the oil change, they also checked my car and found a deteriorating driver-side CV boot. They showed me the damage in comparison to the passenger side which had no damage.

We discussed the pros and cons and the potential outcomes and costs. I researched boot/axel replacements online and everything that they explained and showed to me checked out.

They provided every opportunity to save money and drove me to a place of my choice to wait- very impressive. They were able to get the part right away because they have a warehouse of parts in town. The oil change took an hour and the axel replacement took another hour. Not bad for an axel replacement.

They even gave me a 10% discount on the service. These guys know how to provide good service.<//Text>

I've had two oil changes and some tire work done here. In my three or four interactions with the staff they were courteous and clear. They always priced out all the different options for recommendations on extra services but never pushed them or tried to pressure me into buying anything. One thing I can't stand about other places (JLube) is their insistence on trying to up-sell me on a bunch of random crap I can do myself for way cheaper.

In addition, whenever I've received estimates for different services they always look for coupons (even if I didn't bring them in) to make sure I'm getting the discounts their offering. And once, they priced out a bunch of services with discounts built in and said the price was good for whenever I wanted to get it done. About two months later I took them up on a few of the services and there was no questions asked, all discounts applied.

I'll be continuing to employ this honest place of business.</Text>

I am a female, and hate getting my car worked on! Just needed an oil change. I googled "best oil change in SLO," and Meineke came up. Gave it a shot! Mike at the front desk was VERY helpful and friendly. The price charged was exactly the price quoted, and they didn't try to tell me I needed additional work on my vehicle (which happens a lot as a female!!). They even have free wifi, netflix and coffee! What more could you want?!! I recommend them for sure! Thank you!!!< /Text>

Called Meineke on my day off cause my brakes were shaking, they got me an appointment for an hour after I called. Got there and was greeted promptly, they offered me a free brake inspection which I did. They told me all of my pads were great but the rotors were warped (which I figured was the issue going in).
They gave me a few options for brake rotors including the brand I wanted. They gave me the exact prices for the options and started the work right away.
I also had my kids with me which they offered control over the TV &  Netflix for the kids which worked out great. Lots of seating (chairs and couches). Free WiFi as well. Met the manager (John) which was helping out and was awesome. Highly recommended place for car work here in SLO! They also have a Keurig coffee maker and good brand of coffee for free while you're waiting.<//Text>

Thought about much about posting this. This has been my go to urgent care. Dr Alvarez was rude and impatient at our visit. He didn’t even answer my questions and was very unfriendly. I felt so uncomfortable. The nurse was very friendly and nice, but rest of the staff was not. I will not be returning to this location.< /Review>

The doctor is great, very friendly caring and personable. The nurses are attentive and helpful. The folks at the front desk seem to prefer you weren't there, not a great introduction. Overall a good experience, but frustrating.< /Text>

I am a first time patient with a really bad knee pain and i choose this place because they offer X-ray I came in and didn’t get an X-ray done due to no technician and was told to come back the next day if that was the case they need to advertise  X-rays are only available so and so days because if that was the case I would have went somewhere else.</Text>

We went in Sunday afternoon and I was amazed on how fast every thing went. My autistic son was nervous because he needed stitches. The nurses and doctor made him feel safe and comfortable, and we were in and out in 45min. Definitely recommend mcoming here if you want to avoid the nonsense of the ER.<//Text>

<text>I have taken my daughters there a few times. Each and every time they have been professional and kind. The doctors we have seen have been truly amazing. Great bedside manner. I always recommend them. I was injured last year and the doctor was truly surprised and the sympathy and concern he had for me. I will continue to go there.  Highly recommend!!</text>< Pics>

I never knew how easy it was to get seen on the same day so fast, no appointment, and pharmacy got necessary prescription immediately same day. Doctor was really calm and understanding, not doubtful of my symptoms, unlike other doctors. Ladies up front were really nice and helpful too.<//review>

<review>I went in the day of Christmas Eve and was seen promptly. The doctor who saw me diagnosed a chest virus but did prescribe antibiotics and OTC cough syrup. I am visiting from Hawaii and visiting friends so you can understand my misery! I went back to my friends house and curled up in bed and hibernated in their guest room until New Years Eve when I decided I was either dying or I wished I was!

On going back in to the clinic with severe, and obvious, pulmonary distress I was advised to take a seat in the full waiting room. I politely told the desk clerk I was having difficulty breathing and I was informed it was first come first served. After listening to me try to breath (no joke I could NOT breath!) my friend, who had driven me because she didn't trust me to drive as I was, went to the counter and rather coldly told the clerk I could not breathe and I needed to be seen NOW!

I was seen almost immediately after that, lol. The doctor looked at my BP, oxygen levels, and chest sounds (around my coughing fits that left me limp and dizzy) and immediately told me I needed to be seen in the ER and I needed an ambulance and an oxygen bottle. My friend said that was good and she would meet me there. They called the ambulance and stayed with me until they arrived, giving me a breathing treatment while we waited. Turns out I had double pneumonia!

So, to recap, I received excellent service from the doctors and medical personnel. The clerks were polite but rather uncaring on the 2nd visit. Just a recommendation,  if someone says they can't breath BELIEVE them!! Otherwise, I do recommend this location.<//review><user_name>Linnea Gimby</user_name>< gmapID>

<Review>Doctor was very nice and professional. He was very good at handling my daughter with her fears. Insurance handling was top notch had no issue. For me that was a big plus. So far this is the best urgent care in Bakersfield. I been to a few over the years. Hope this helps these are good people.<//Review>< Time>

I didn't even know the Dr prescribed a rx until the pharmacy called. It was slow and we waited FOREVER in the exam room. Maybe an off day? Hmm who knows.<//review>

Usually not too busy, but it happened to be this last time we went because it was a Sunday and it's flu season, so that was expected. They have followed up the last couple of times we've gone with a phone call a couple days later to see how the patient is doing, which was a nice touch.< /Text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>(Translated by Google) I went for the first time today because of the earache I arrived at 8:00 pm and they quickly attended to me.
For me all the staff is very friendly.
And they gave me an antibiotic, hopefully it helps me
Tomorrow I'll come back for another one 💉

Laguna Beach Cliff Hike is a must if you're more interested in the unique often missed gems in Laguna Beach OR just want a cool run with good views :) The trail is perfect distance! Once you get higher up you will have two routes actually three if your interested exploring east. If you go the natural route to the top you have two layers of trails. Both trails are awesome once you get to the top you get a clear somewhat steep view of what appears to be The Montage golf course. Watchout for mountain lions and rattlesnakes, etc.<//text>

Perfect short hike with a great reward! Took us about 45 minutes from start to finish and we could have gone a good deal faster. Wildflowers are beautiful in this small canyon and the view can’t be beat. Highly recommend!<//text>

Beautiful Hike! At the times I've been here it's never been crowded ... Just you and the nature and the beautiful views. It is more of a hike (up hill ) rather than a trail. Super narrow pathways.<//Text>

Valispro trail head is a great short hike. 900 feet elevation gain in .75 of a mile. On weekends it's a zoo but weekdays it's not terribly crowded</text>

This is a favorite hike for our family with great views of Laguna Beach! There are two approaches and one is more difficult than the other. The south trailhead is our favorite, but is more difficult. It begins in a residential neighborhood and ascends something like 600-650 feet in a matter of a 1/4-1/2 mile. With kids, this might be a little difficult. The other approach is from the East and is much more moderate because you park on top of a hill. When you come to the fork in the trail near the end, keep right to ascend to the tallest part of the peak. The views are excellent and there is a bench at the top. Beware of the sharp cliffs with the kids!</review>

This is where I live. Cheapest rent in town. I live in my RV, this beats storing it. Low space rent. Owners just installed solar panels. Clean. Many shaded spaces. There is a waiting list to get in.<//text>

Manager was very nice and accommodating.  This is a very bare-bones site. Not fancy but I felt safe eventhough the place is a bit run down. We were visiting family & just needed a place to park our trailer & sleep. I would return.<//review>

<review>The trail and field is real nice next door to the trailer park.  The road in front of the trailer park has a crosswalk with another trail along side the main road.  There are also train tracks across the street< /review>< Pics>

Cute community, Google maps says it's on the East side of Sierra Highway, so you drive past looking on the wrong side of the road. It's close to the bowling alley.< /Review>

Beautiful place nice and quiet, very clean. Hard to get ahold of the manager but when you do He’s very nice and straightforward. Easy process to get approved or Denied . The place has no crime history and tenants are friendly and this place is close to shopping centers. Rent space is affordable 400$-450$ , electric is metered so you pay for what you use , Plus there’s on site laundry center so win win here< /review>

Very slow management staff. Took 6 days to review application and actually call us back. By then, we had found a way better park to call home for less! Happy we didn't wait for them. Kind of a sign how it'd be living there.< /Text>

On site manager was gone for three weeks, and no one could take a reservation or tell me if they had any spots, or how much the rent was. I am so glad I found another RV Park where they tell you what is going on, and they answer your questions, Dodged a bullet here, for sure!!!</Text>

<Review>It's not a resort, it's a trailer/rv park. My husband is out here working the powerlines, and there are a few workers that live here as well. We've been here since 2012, and never had a problem. We were here just for work. Not a RV park for vacation<//Review></record>

< review>
Ive been here for 18 mths and ive been given a letter stating I cant stay here and have 30 days to leave or a eviction will be started. Ive paid my rent , had no issues but when I ask why the park management says they dont need a reason and dont have to tell you the reason cause we are here with a month to month lease. They are pushing people out who live here so that they can have the powerline people move in from out of state. Dont come here or else this can happen to you.< /review>

<Text>The store was out of a lot of things, basic things like crusts, bread sticks, toppings. Other than that, my order went fairly well, but my son’s didn’t. He couldn’t get the order to work on his phone, so I used mine. Got all of his order in, hit the submit button and got a message saying they had just ran out of crust so choose another crust type. In doing so, their order went from $45 to $101. That was for 2 large pizzas, one with 2 toppings, one with cheese, 12 wings, and a cookie. So, we tried calling directly to order. We were put on hold. After over 5 minutes of waiting, we hung up and went to McDonald’s.</Text>< pics>

<Text>Horrible customer service.  The employees at the front can be seen chatting with each other instead of answering customer phone calls.  Don't bother putting in an order to pick up at a later time through the app, it won't be ready or they'll wait until you arrive to start making it.  Even then, your order will still be wrong and missing items (it happened to me).  Lastly, they always run out of something! Whether it's pasta or pizza ingredients, but they can never fulfill orders properly.</Text>< Name>

I brought them home and they were fresh and warm however the taste was quite horrible! They were even worse than those frozen pizzas! I am so dissatisfied and sorry for my order!</Review>< rate>

<Review>Don't care how busy you are, or that it's Saturday night, you don't ignore someone that's picking up an order, especially when it was placed way before anyone else's! We were standing there waiting while several employees walked up to or past the counter and completely ignored us. Horrible customer service, don't recommend.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

So horrible. 3 different events where messed up due to there lack of service.. 1st was a birthday party they messed up on didnt bring food then when we called they said we never ordered but we had proof so they apologized and brought cold pizza. Second time we ordered pizza and ordered 6 hrs in advanced for a surprise birthday. They where  still half hour after desired curbside pick up unfortunatelyparty started with no food..... 3rd event did not get pizza 3hrs after desired pick up and ordered pizza almost 12 hrs in advanced. And even to get that done wa hard and had to pay extra to get it delivered because I didn't want to wait another hour outside at curbside. Always a different manager and they never hold up to their word or credits.i have asked for a corporate number and they won't give me one. I have tried to ask manger to make this right but they don't. Also when I was inside trying to figure out my order because I was waiting for curbside for so long and no one answering I saw they took the phones off the ringer so they would have not even answered me anyways. Just really poor service.<//review>

The food quality is poor!
Paid for 4 sauces that they didn't deliver!!
Paid for 2 pizzas to be pan crust and got then in hand tossed!!! We dont like hand toss especially with out the extra marinara sauce we paid for!
The pizza was dry and not what we ordered!</Text>

The worst pizza hit.  How do you run out of pizza?  Your Pizza Hut with no Pizza, Pasta, or desserts.  So are you Wing and Cheesebread Hut.<//Text>

<review>Called in an order from Smith River . Was told 45 minute to be ready. We arrived very close to that time. They had called my house and of course we were out front. We called upon arrival and a guy came out and a girl followed him and took over. She informed us it would be another 30 minutes wait. That they had had 5 regular people quit and were busy. Phone orders walk ins etc. Yadda yadda. We had ordered 2 large pan pizzas. They were told we were coming from Smith River. And when I asked why she said that they had gotten behind in getting orders out and that our order had not been cooked yet.  Or that they had given our order to someone else who called after we did. Not happy with this Pizza Hut. Go one time it's good. Go back and this is how your taken care of. When asked how long if they delivered it to our house in Crescent City she said an hour or hour and a half. We cancelled and Papa Murphy took 10 minutes and we went home.<//review><Name>Karen Rosenberg< /Name>< Gmap_id>

Order was ready super quick. Hot and we'll put together. Girl that brought my curbside delivery was really nice and smiling. Only taking off 1 star because they forgot my buttery garlic crust flavoring, which seems to happen at 9 out of 10 Pizza Hut's I order from. This systemic crust ignorance needs to stop in Merica or I'm going to march on the freeway in protest!!!</Text>

Tasted like the pizza and bread sticks were DAYS old. So stale! And the bread sticks had zero seasoning on it. The wings were really good. Everything else was terrible, hard and dry.</text>

The staff is friendly enough and the food is fine but the prices are insane. By far the most expensive pizza hut I've ever visited. They also don't accept most online coupons. Its hard to get a pizza under 15 dollars.<//Review>

Pizza was good as usual. Love the supreme! Restaurant was like an ice box though... Not a pleasant dining experience... We rushed to finish because taking it out wasn't really an option.</review>

<review>The way the pizza comes out is too unpredictable. When I pay as much as they're asking I expect it to be perfect every time. I've had some pretty disgusting pizzas before. Little Caesars sure it's cheap. Pizza hut though, it's too big of a bid. Then it's one hell of a fight to get a refund. I'd rather just stick to Papa.<//review>< Pics>

<username>Cary Harrison<//username><review>Never got to try food. I ordered a $15 dollar pizza with 2 extra toppings and delivery. (My motel was right across the street) and the total was $30 dollars. I asked about a meatlovers pizza....?30. Get over yourselves. I went to Subway and got 2 footling sandwiches for 13 bucks with whatever extras I wanted. The guy on the phone at Pizza hut had no idea extra toppings were-he put me on hold to ask- and was short and rude on the phone. Sad when resteraunts tank that bad.<//review><Rating>1< /Rating>< Time>

Love this place. Service is on spot. The bar tender, we call her "yes" because we can't pronounce her name, us super sweet. We had 2 beers each and the environment was diverse but enjoyable. My birthday was mellow but awesome. Thank you Panchos.</Review>

Sad we do not have pizza hut in Lapine, Oregon.  I guess we are coming back.< /Review><response>None<//response>< Rating>

Would be 5 stars, but you don't deliver up to South Bank and that's kind of a bummer. Service and staff are great! Just, the delivery thing. Like, c'mon man.<//Text>

<Review>I've already done a previous review of the Crescent City Pizza Hut. While I absolutely love Pizza Hut pizzas I don't always like the service I get from the one in Crescent City. Since it's the only one around within a 2-hour driving radius I have no choice. When I have a craving for Pizza Hut there's not much I can do but to drive all the way to Crescent City. It's an addiction, a mild form of an addiction. The younger people there in that restaurant that work there need to stop screwing around, stop goofing off and get serious about their jobs, and be friendly to everyone that comes in there.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x54d06622cbb07bc9:0xee512875c6e50f60< /GmapID></record>

<text>After ordering over 20 times on the online menu, I have not had a problem with any of my orders.  The women and men are always friendly, and quick to wait on me when I meet them at the counter.
Update:  I just got my order, and the pizza was as usual delicious!  The thin and crispy is my favorite.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I had a horrible experience. We ordered a pepperoni lover's stuffed crust and it was disgusting. My teenage daughter and I could only eat one piece each and it was $20. Definitely not worth what they charge for it. :-(. Good thing the salad and wings were good. I'm still trying to wash off the grease that was dripping off the pizza.<//Review>

I have tried this place a few times and I have never got a pizza that was good. Way to much sauce not enough cheese always a disappointment.< /review>

<review>Absolutely not, no prices on submenu which was odd, totally self service, and the pizza didn't taste like Pizza Hut.  It was also loaded with grease. Crescent City Pizza Hut  would not be a go to for me, ever.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

We're from out of state. Pizza Hut in our valley is sub-par but my wife wanted to try it here. Best experience you could ask for. Rebecca was very courteous and the pricing (though higher than CSP) was straightforward. It's too bad we don't live nearby or we would come here a lot.</Review>

<text>Descent pizza! Look for (and ask) about advertised specials. Sometimes they "aren't in the computer". Last 2 times, I've looked at ads online,only to go in,order the special, and have the employees look at me slightly puzzled...order online and save a $1 "service fee" by going in and ordering.(It saves to let the robots do everything- It costs extra money for human interaction)  Pizza Hut!<//text><Date>1561895619625< /Date>< Response>

Thanks for not showing me my pizza at the counter so when I get all the way home I come to find out they didn’t put any pepperoni on my pizza and then I bring it all the back and have to wait and get home to the new pizza not even cut!! You kids suck.!!<//Text>

<text>VERY VERY BAD!  They have great wings but disgusting pizza!  Being disabled, I had my sister go down to place an order for wings, salad and apple pies.  Was charged for pies & salad and then told they were out of wings. Cancelled the order and then told they could not give a refund but only a store credit.  I spoke to a girl stating she was the in-charge and not authorized to give refunds. When I asked her to call the manager she refused! Told her I would be coming down for my refund.  Had my sister take me to the store in my wheelchair.  The girl would not come out to talk to me but instead called the police on me! The girl then stated it was a corporate policy not to give refunds. Guess they would rather have an unhappy customer than to refund my $7.50.  Sure wish we had a Dominos or a Papa Johns.  Do not go to this Pizza Hut! Read all the reviews first!</text>< response>

Been coming here for years.  Everyone is wonderful, friendly and professional. Wouldn't go anywhere else.  They are so good that I got my husband to join me for a pedicure.</Text>

<Review>My first time here and I loved it.  Everyone was friendly.  The place was very clean.  I had a deluxe pedicure with hot paraffin wax added, oh such a wonderful feeling!  I also got the dip powder on my natural nails with Mary.  She did a great job! My nails came out looking and feel natural!  I will never go back to acrylic again now that I’ve gotten the dip powder ! Thanks KC nails,, I will definitely be back! :)</Review><Name>Vanessa Walter</Name>< rating>

The fee for using ATM/Credit Card to pay has to go. It's not right customers have to pay for that abusive fee.
KC Nails owner should absorb that fee.<//text>

Just got my mani and pedi...alright service. The spa massage chair did not work and i brought it to their attention. You would think some type of discount. The massage was just a basic let me put lotion on you. I wont be back.

I don't post negative comments just to do it. I advised your technician there was an issue with the chair, she tried getting it to work and could not explain why it would shut off after a minute. Wrong salon, sure lady, I've been there, its obvious the quality has gone down. A professional response would be, what can I do to make up for the service.< /text>

< review>
Went here after I walked out of polish mi. They did a good job, but when I went back for my fill and pedicure, not so much, the guy that did my pedicure was so slow that two ladies came in after me left before me and they were having the same thing done.  I left with my pedicure looking like I needed a pedicure and the gel on my fill looked so bad that I had to go home and fix, they didn't paint the whole nail they missed spots, and the polish look like it was already coming off even thou I paid for gel.  Will not go bac.  I miss beautiful nails.  Now have to find a new place.< /review>

Under new ownership!  New spa chairs, whole lot more new gel polishes to choose from! And also hundreds colors of the dipping powder!!! More importantly customer service is their #1 priority!!! If you’re not happy with the service they’re more than happy to fix it!<//Review>

Shoutout to Jim’s Music for helping me select a guitar for my mom (early Christmas present) and for hooking me up with a free ukelele during their Black Friday raffles!! Now both her and I will have something new to play and learn. Friendly staff and a wide variety of instruments. I highly recommend this place!< /text>

They are so helpful! I have no idea how the prices compared to Amazon.... And I don't really care.... Because being able to walk in and get really helpful service and actually end up with something that I want and is useful....priceless.   The first time I went here was to get a cord for my son, another franchise had tried to sell me something super expensive Jims sales guy heard what I needed and got me something nice and cheap that did the trick. Today I went back to get a guitar. I had first stopped by guitar center and the salesperson was 100% unhelpful. Then I saw Jim's sign remember that they were there and my positive plastic experience and decided to stop in. Within 10 minutes I had exactly what I was looking for at a price that I felt great about.   Best of both worlds. supported local business, and get great value people who know what they're talking about and wanting to help.  I have three kids we will definitely be back here for more as they grow.< /review>

<Review>Most important thing in a music store is I can browse without someone hovering over my shoulder. They let you do that here. Asked if I needed help, and I said I was just looking. No pressure after that, I could look around with getting the evil eye from staff. Scoped out the guitars but wasn't ready to buy last week. Went back today with the firm idea of which model I wanted, and got a good deal. Highly recommend Jim's Music Center.</Review>< pictures>

Great store, with friendly and knowledgeable sales staff. I was visiting from out of town and stopped in on a Friday around noon.  I was greeted by at least 3 employees and allowed to play whatever guitar I desired.  I got a 60% off deal on Elixir guitar strings.  I placed myself on their mailing list, and will be back.  Good job, guys!<//text>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Wow. I'm so beside myself. I need strings for my husbands guitar. They have a "GUITAR MEDIC" in the parking lot that fixes them. Resetting my guitar right there mark time of 15min. No kidden'!!
Don helped me with picking out strings. Decided to use strings that are easy on our fingers. Gave us several tips and I had a pleasant time in their store. Never going anywhere else. I needed a guitar tuner and apparently the guitar medic really likes the brand I picked. "SNARK". So happy to go in a store where people really are about you. Thank you.< /Text>< pics>

<time>1433948815898</time><text>As a professional musician, I look for good selection, a knowledgeable staff and reasonable prices. I've shopped at Jim's for 30 years now and have never had a reason to go anywhere else. They always have what I'm looking for, and if not, they order it and get it there quickly. I'm always surprised by the prices, which are far better than Guitar Center or the like. As far as service, Tom Sebastian has been my go-to guy for three decades and never disappointed me.

Yeah, there are negative remarks from those who think other customers actually want to hear them perform a hour-long concert of stale licks in the middle of the store at 100 decibels, but I appreciate that Jim's discourages this sort of thing. And I've never been told no when I asked to play an instrument. It's called having respect for others.

Do yourself a favor and make this your music store.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>walked in to buy some violin strings and some piano music for some students.  Also asked some advice from the girls behind the counter about the best beginner flute and trumpet for a student as well.  They were very knowledgeable and helped with music and information.  The best in the area in my opinion as I am a retired public school music teacher.</review>< resp>

<Text>Great local music store with a really helpful and knowledgeable staff. Tommy helped me get a great deal on a beautiful Epiphone Broadway that I've been eyeing for a while. Very glad that a place like Jim's is so close by in Tustin.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Review>The personal is very friendly, I been buying on this place for 5 years, after a bad experience on guitar center in my last 3 times visit that place, (been buying for years) so I decided to look for different store, and I find this place has excellent service, some times after they know me, ther order Aguilar bass cabs with not put deposit, just they trust me, I do recommend this place!</Review>< Pictures>

I am a professional musician and music instructor.  I have sent dozens and dozens of students to purchase from Jim's Music.  And I have personally purchased more than a dozen new instruments from Jim's myself.  They have been in the area, serving Orange County for decades.  They sell and rent thousands of instruments to the local school districts, and they outfit many area churches with their sound systems.  All of the staff is very knowledgable and professional, and they are not there to give input when they do not know the proper answer.  They also do not try to upset you, or give you advice just to get you to purchase something.  They are trusted people, and most of the staff are professional area musicians as well.  I send all of my students there, and have for fifteen years.  Great store, where you will normally get great service.</Text>

My family has purchased guitars here and had the best experience, with knowledgeable clerks that exhibited enthusiasm in their work.  When my Grandson broke his guitar, he was very satisfied with repairs and the restringing  and tuning demonstration.< /text>

<review>I was shopping for a specific multi-effect board with a list price of $1,500.  Not only did the Guitar Center guys not even know what I was talking about they didn't even offer to order it.  I stopped into Jim's and spoke with Don. Don immediately got his TC rep on the phone and got me the same deal that TC was offering to Sweetwater On-Line buyers ($999) and had it in the store in a week.    These guys are so good I drive from San Diego, right by 4 Guitar Centers, to buy from them.  Don and Aaron know their stuff.<//review>< pictures>

I custom ordered a G&L bass from Tom and I couldn't be happier. Everything went smooth and the order was dead on. Everyone there was very professional. They went over the bass before we even plugged it in and did any needed adjustments. I highly recommend them. Thanks Tom and crew! You guys ROCK \m/ >_<< /review>

<Text>Don't waste your time! Awful customer service! My son and I walked around for while, we were not helped until I went to the counter. The man behind the counter acted like I was interrupting him, when he was just standing there.  He looked at me like I was rude to ask for help. He proceeded to show me the expensive guitars for a beginning player- my teenage son. He made us feel unwelcome and unhappy we were in the store. We left without buying a guitar and lessons. I am taking my business where I am treated nice. Guitar center was much more pleasant of an experience.< /Text><user_id>113655368421514506978< /user_id><date>1410192889647</date><GmapID>0x80dcdbe6dd22dd63:0x5b8ef2803968a68b<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service. We bought a clarinet from them and after 6 months there was a problem with one of the keys. At Jim's they took care of it without any questions, FOC. Go ahead and find someone online to do that for you....</review>

Excellent.  Salesperson/manager Tom sold me a terrific set of new headphones (discounted price) for my new CP4 Yamaha keyboard.  He also wisely had me hook-up my keyboard to my living room stereo in lieu of using a keyboard amp at home, saving me money for a monitor amp/pa system should I gig (peform elsewhere on my keyboard).  He's a former entertainer himself, and knows what works.  Call, go there.  Ask.  He's most knowledgeable.</Text>

Employees are rude, unhelpful and one of them called my friend a "retard" for stringing his guitar incorrectly. I would go to Guitar Center every time over this place if there was one by my house, but unfortunately this is the closest music store around.</review>

Very disappointed in the customer service today.  Went into buy a guitar for my son and strings for my Flamenco guitar.  Short haired guy behind the counter was rude and dismissive.  Probably having a bad day, but shouldn't take it out on customers.  I walked out without buying anything and went to a different music shop to buy the guitar for my son.<//Review>

There's something cool about having a local music store. Maybe it's the underdog appeal or the campy appeal of walking into a business that has clearly taken over a few nearby store-fronts in its slow pace of success (sort of like the nearby Roma D'Italia), but you have to think about the customer base and whether you belong to it.

Jim's Music is in a good position to service the elderly residents of Tustin, who may be too put-off by the weird bazaar of instruments seen in Guitar Centers. I've been in shopping for parts and seen more than a fair share of Baby Boomers getting their strings replaced or their grandchildren fitted for a ukulele. On that note, I feel as if Jim's other big market-share is in the teenage band member population. A lion's share of their store is dedicated to band instruments, and you'd do well coming here rather than a Guitar Center if your kid needs a trombone.

So how about guitars? Chances are, you're better off buying a guitar online, even though Jim's has a very good history of matching and then beating online pricing. The only problem, therefore, is the stock on hand. There's a small selection to choose from, and chances are your crazy Ibanez guitar from Japan is not among the rows of ukuleles and Orange amps. So why else come here? Instrument repair! In my experience, the guys at Jim's do a fairly good job at whatever you throw at them... when they do manage to get around to it. I had a broken guitar in need of a new selector ordered from one of their partners. I called them back maybe three times to check on the part over the course of two weeks, each time being told that they'd let me know via phonecall when it would arrive. When the third week came, I took the beast to a GC and had it fixed a few days later; not only was I phoned back, I was able to speak with the technician via e-mail, which strikes me as a no brainer in this day and age.

As of 5 weeks after my initial ticket with Jim's, still no phone call. If you want your instrument repaired, you could bring it here... if you want it repaired quickly, look elsewhere. Your gig, recital, training regiment, etc. may depend on it.< /Text>

<review>Do not go to this office, the other bad reviews are correct. The front desk staff is disrespectful and they do not care for patients. They are all focused on a paycheck. Including the founder of practice. When the doctor does not show up for an appointment, they then tell you that you did not show up, despite the ridiculously long questionnaire they have you fill out before entering every appointment. Even with legally signed and dated evidence, they still unapologetically call you a liar.  An unprofessional mental health office at its finest. Don't bother reporting them to the BBB, they're not accredited with them so, this practice doesn't care for customers whatsoever.< /review>< Pics>

DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE!!!!!!!  If I could give this place zero stars I would.  They have horrible customer service and the rudest staff ever.  All they care about is money and not caring for their patients.  They refused to do any paperwork or further documentation until a balance that wasn't even due yet be paid.  Their office manager Andrea is the rudest and instead of trying to help became more and more agitated and unprofessional.  If they show up for their virtual appointments they are more than 30 minutes late but that's if they show up at all.  Again they will not treat or help you unless they have all of their money despite waiting for insurance reimbursement.  Oh and they wont send you statements.  Its your job to magically know that you have balances due.  Again save yourself the time and stress and go to a better place.<//review>

This is the most unprofessional office I have ever been to, by far.

My first appointment they kept me waiting for 2 hours before I could see the doctor, because their payment system was down. I was fortunate that I had the ability to wait 2 hours.
My second appointment they had me wait 27 minutes past my appointment time.
My third appointment they had me waiting for 45 minutes past my appointment time.

On another appointment, I showed up on time, but I could not check in because there was a long line in front of me. Because of the long wait, they said that I was late (less than 5 minutes) and would not let the appointment continue. I was chastised for not showing up even earlier.

Both providers I saw at Dogon were chronically late for their appointments, with no explanation or apology.

The providers and staff at Dogon had absolutely no respect for me or my time.

The doctor also required that I go to a specific provider to get blood work done, despite me already having the same work done four days before my appointment, and despite me already having a medical provider who could do the work. I had to pay out of of pocket because he dictated that I had to have uneccesary work done.

If you're in Riverside, you know that it can take up to three months to get a new doctor. Don't waste your time with this medical group, they will provide subpar service, waste your time, and then mess up the billing.<//Review>

<review>This was terrible. I waited 30 minutes for the doctor and he didn’t show. The staff did not make me aware of what was happening and made the entire experience really unpleasant. It’s tough finding mental health professionals that understand black men and I have to say I’m genuinely disappointed.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Name>

If I could leave zero stars, I would. This was the second therapist I had ever gone to and possibly the worst. We would make weekly appointments and still wait an hour in the waiting room every time; one time, they even forgot to tell my therapist I was there! Every time I talked with her she never listened to what I was trying to talk about and insisted I should be on medication. I am a minor, and my mother won't allow it, so I had expressed it wasn't an option, but she brought it up every time. When I told her I had harmed myself in the past she suddenly told me I needed to go to an inpatient facility or she would have cops take me there. I couldn't even be admitted to the place she sent us because they didn't take minors. When that hospital sent us to a place that did, they evaluated me and told me I didn't need to stay. This therapist didn't help me the entire year I was seeing her, and neither did the psychiatrist Dr. Dey, who blatantly ignored every word I said to him during my appointment. I don't recommend going here unless you want to get worse.<//review>

i would give zero stars if i could. mr. mavernie mitchell blamed me for being in an abusive relationship, told me i was too sensitive the first day i met her, and never remembered my problems. i had to explain my whole life story to her almost every appointment, which was weekly. the staff at the front was also very rude and insensitive to crazy schedules. this is the worst therapy experience i have ever had. i felt worse after almost every appointment. please do yourself a favor and don't come here. you deserve to go somewhere where they treat you like a human with compassion, instead of forgetting you and being incredibly rude.< /review>

<review>So far i havent seen Dr. Dey, but the experience is already bad. I waited for a while on my live virtual appmt. I called to say i was i. The waiting room online and how long would the wait be. They said my appointment was reescheduled, but had never notified me. I could have waited an hour and nobody was coming online. Could they not see they had a patient o line waiting? Why didn't they call me to say i was rescheduled? I wonder what the actual visit will be like. I am not waiting. I am going to find another doctor. Zero stars.<//review></record>

Seems like a pretty good office, this is my son’s first time. The wait was pretty long. But it’s clean and they did have Netflix playing for the kids. Staff is friendly and helpful. Again this is our first visit. But after reading all the reviews it wasn’t as bad as a lot of people said it was. So I’m happy I checked it out for myself first before going off what I read.</Text>

Said I needed to call my insurance for new place! I was shocked because my behavior therapist spoke so highly of them and I hadn't even seen anyone yet! This was going to be my first appointment! I cried after we hung up because of how negative the woman was about it. What a way to start my day for them to call me and say that! I would suggest finding a place with caring hearts towards people .This places gets thumbs down from me. Wow. Just wow.</Review>< pics>

<Text>I happened to listen in on my mom struggling to make an appointment for my sister, she was asking the representative, "You don't have time to make me an appointment? So when will you have time?" (In a sincerely confused tone). It broke my heart that there are people who treat still treat those who have an accent as if they didn't matter and with no sense of urgency. It is a shame and I hope this will be corrected.
Anyways, I took over the phone, asked my mom if I could speak with the representative, she gave me the phone, looking confused still.
I informed the rep that I overheard the bit that my mom was struggling for an appointment and that she wanted to see when was a good time to call back. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? I work in customer service, you simply don't say that. As a human being, you simply don't treat people in that manner, especially in that position. I asked why did he tell my mom he did not have time to make an appointment? He said, "I need an authorization #." I replied, "So it's not that you don't have time, you simply need an authorization #?" He paused for some time, then I said, "Hello?" Reluctantly, he said "Yes." I asked, " Then why would you tell my mom you don't have time for her? I assume That's your job, isn't it? To help people make follow up appointments?" After a long pause, he agreed. I asked to speak with the manager, was placed on hold, he then informed me she wasn't available. I asked for her and his name. He spelled them out for me. "A-M-B-E-R. K-E-N." Last time I checked, when you reply in that manner to a simple question, unless the other person is hard of hearing or has some kind of special needs or specifically asks you to spell the words or name, you just don't do that. It comes off sarcastic and to be honest I felt like I was being treated as if I were plain stupid.
Well, that's my experience here.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80dcb1b7505c907d:0x278999ca8a2a8f2c</gmapID></record>

I'll admit, that after reading many of the reviews I wasn't excited about my referral to this practice.

That being said, I'm convinced that a lot of the bad reviews have to be shills.

In my experience, Staff at Dogon have been very reasonable, patient, helpful, & did their best to make sure I was accommodated.

Speaking to the Dr., it's obvious that he has extensive experience & expertise, and had my best interest in mind.

I went in asking/expecting for a certain prescription, which he refused to prescribe. He suggested tests first, which I reluctantly took, and eventually prescribed an alternative.

The new plan has done wonders for my treatment.

If you're looking for treatment from a doc and staff that truly care about your mental health I'd highly recommend visiting Dogon Behavioral.<//review>

<text>I have been trying to make an appointment here for 2 months. I finally hear from them and they give me attitude as if I hadn’t put forth effort into contacting them.
The M.A. at the clinic that referred me to this place had to contact them FOR ME to make an appointment.......
This morning at 7:18AM the office called my phone to confirm my appointment.
BEFORE confirming they had the CORRECT person on the phone, they proceeded to give out all details about the reason for my visit (mental and behavioral health), date and time.
I swiftly told her that was unacceptable as I have children that answer my phone and I’m pretty sure that’s a patient privacy violation.
She actually said “most people keep there phone on them and answer it themselves”😦
I have never encountered such unprofessionalism at a facility like this EVER! She didn’t even apologize for her error!
I will not be going to my appointment. I don’t want to become a patient at a facility that is this unprofessional and careless with private information.</text>< Rating>

If a zero rating would be possible in order post this review, that's what it would be.This clinic is ridiculous! One has to wait 3 hours to be seen! And when one is finally called back to speak with the "Psychiatrist" you can't even express your worries/concerns or ask any questions! He will shut you down before you can finish a sentence. When one calls the first thing they do is put you on hold for over 20 minutes. The 'medical assistants' do not know how to do their job correctly. Dr. Samuel Dey ordered some lab work and when I arrive at the Labcorp I find out these "medical assistants" NEVER sent the order over when it had to of been sent over 2 weeks ago!!!! I desperately asked for them to sent over the lab-order by fax and they refused one too many times! Useless!!! If you are looking for a mental health clinic, I do not recommend this place at all!<//text>

Some people may get what they need from here, but I have to say this place was the most DISGUSTING MEDICAL SERVICE I ever had. Charged me all the money and didn't actually do anything for me. I was referred to a therapist who calls herself German-Yugoslav. She will get attitude and look down upon depressed people. Treats you like dumb and won't allow you to see doctor.</Text>

You would think that people dealing with mental health would have a friendlier office staff. The absolute worst and rude staff. The way they practice here is the worst as well. They are more concerned about making the $$$ than they are the patient. Appointment  after appointment, money, money money ... The waiting room feels cold and asthetic. It’s a warmer friendlier feeling waiting at the DMV. Can’t wait until we’re back with Kaiser.</review>

<text>I'm extremely grateful to Dogon Behavioral.

I've been seeing Dr. Dey for a few months now. Prior to visiting Dogon Behavioral, I was struggling with my illness and it had been difficult to find a good provider. When I was referred to Dogon, I gave them a call and they scheduled me right away.

While he may have his quirks (like the glasses), I've realized that Dr. Dey is extremely professional and genuinely has the best interests of his patients in mind. His treatment has been great for me, and his staff is always accommodating and professional.

My only suggestion is figuring out an alternative for bathroom entry. Aside from that, my experience has been great.

Would definitely recommend.<//text>< gmapID>

The staff at Dogon has givin me nothing but great advise and know how to help you with Meds. Every where you go now a days is all about money, and it's No different here. That is why they Work everyday just as the rest of us do. Really, if you don't like Dogon, GO SOMEWHERE else, or follow their Advise and Rules. Peace to all that read this.< /Review>

<text>This place is Terrible!!! I have so many things to say I don't even know where to start... I brought my 7 yr old here and had to wait 3 hrs our 1st visit to be seen, once in with Dr. Dey he was rude, abrasive, unwelcoming and spoke over me any time I tried to express what's happening. He instantly wanted to medicate my child without any rhyme or reasoning as to why or explanation to me as to what was going on with my child and once I resisted in order to be given a diagnosis before drugging my kid, he stopped seeing us and we would only be given an appt with the nurse practitioner, which solved nothing. BUT I have Excellent news!!! We found Quality life group and dr. Kotomori is a true life saver! I promise you there is good help out there... so skip this place and save yourself the time and pain.< /text>< pics>

Don't waste your time going here. We waited more than 2 hours and 2 appointments just for someone to tell us that they cant help us. Just simple discrimination to those who have trouble speaking "the main language" They were recommended by our insurance provider. Again, don't waste your time here.< /text>

If I can bare bone paraphrase the clinic as a whole... PATIENT MALPRACTICE. NP John is very respectable and probably the only respectable one there. He discusses treatment thoroughly but ultimately gives patient the choice. On the flip side, the receptionists are some of the lousiest people on the face of the planet. I’m sure they are fine people outside of the practices walls... well, that is I sure hope they are. Multiple times I have had scheduling issues, at times comcerning a lapse in medicine, and they could care less to try and help. One of the women receptionists literally told me, “it’s not our problem”, when I asked, “so what, you are just going to let me go into a mental institution”, concerning my laps in medicines that they were unwilling to accommodate through scheduling. (If you are In need of surety that medications won’t be mixed up, or if you can’t function without them [like me], keep on moving, they don’t care if you run out). It’s obvious that the receptionists do not understand or care to understand what it is like to be someone with mental health problems and they don’t understand not having a schedule and needing to be places. This last time was the final straw; they canceled me and could not give me a solution since I was going to be out of medicine soon. They also have a token for the bathroom, if they are willing to give it to you, or sometimes I have heard them ask someone to pay (who did not obviously). I am now with a new practice, and filing a grievance with my healthcare provider for their patient malpractice. My new psychiatrist even looked up Dogon behavioral, and asked me if I had read all the reviews; he said, “I read the reviews, I’m not surprised they weren’t willing to help you.” I wouldn’t have waisted my time if I would have read their reviews to begin with.</Text>

<text>These people are rude and in my opinion, seem horribly racist. If I could give this place a negative star, I would. My daughter is biracial (African and Irish decent) and these people have lost their minds. My daughter said she felt extremely uncomfortable there and asked me to find a new doctor. I am of African American decent and can see that they only cater to 100 percent African American families because the treatment we received was different from the no-biracial families.  They tried to make me sound crazy when they schedule an appointment for a certain day and when I call to confirm, they say I missed the appointment.

The appointment was set for the 31st, I confirmed it repeatedly. They said that it was set for the 30th and that I missed. I know I set it for the 31st because I remember making a comment that it was Halloween. Because it was the third missed appointment, I was told that it was company policy that my daughter could not be seen. I thought I had lost my mind because I was sure that, it was set for the 31st. When I asked for a confirmation for the new appointment on Nov 6th, they told me they could not give me one, not even if I came in in person. I find it  funny, with such strict policies, you wouldn't work on facilitating the process of reminding your client.

I can see that they obviously don't care based on the previous reviews here. I should have checked before I took my child there. Seems like this clinic needs a mental evaluation themselves. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. They have no desire to work, let alone help anyone. Absolute garbage. The girl in the front is in heat for the guy by the way, we all see it. He's clearly not interested, give it up. It might be because there is too much cream in your coffee. Just saying.< /text>< Resp>

<user>108508987306815630219</user><text>Definitely the worst medical office I've ever had the displeassure to be treated by.

Extremely unorganized and Dr. Dey and Dogon dgaf about their patients. For those of you that are bringing your children here, switched doctors AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!

Para los que traen a sus hijos aqui, cambien de doctor. No son nada de organizados y me resetaron medicina sin saber bien mis enfermedades.

I've been receiving treatment here for my mental health for about 7 months now. Come to find out, they don't have any of my initial studies on record. You know the studies that are used to decide what medicine is best to treat you with.

I found this out because my insurance required a preauthorization for a specific medication. Long story short I've been having to go back and forth with my insurance and Dogon just to find out that Dogon hadnt contacted my insurance, and clinic has left me waiting for 2 weeks with no response. This is after Dr. Dey, the director of the clinic met with me personally and told me they didnt have my studies on file.

What really pissed me off is he just shrugged it off like it's not a big deal. And after a message was left with Dr. Dey that i had dropped off the studies, 2 weeks later they still have nothing for me. The guy hasnt even responded to the message!</text>< Name>

He will take your money and charge you for services you do not need. Insurance fraud? I am sure going to find out if I have legal / ethical  cause to move forward. My 19 year old daughter was recently released from a mental health care facility and needed to get a primary psychiatrist so that she could keep taking her meds regularly. She is on lamictal which is a mood stabilizer. She has been on it for months. He told her she needed an ekg, blood work, all kinds of labs etc etc... He also told her she could not use the lab at our primary care. He gave her only 2 weeks of medication. She said she cant afford the co-pay that often and he told her oh well she better find somewhere else to go. I am filling a complaint with the Board of Psychology. I am also contacting my insurance company and filing a claim against his office. Samuel Dey tried to take advantage of my daughter and from all the reviews I have read it is not the 1st time he has tried to swindle money out of people for services they did not need. Shame on this dr and I am going to make sure it is noted everywhere that matters that this is happening.</text>< pictures>

I have been going to this clinic for a year and  half and every 3 months my medication authorisation expires and I must beg the clinic  to submit it. I can't stress enough how disruptive to my life it is to go on and off the medication I need because of beurocratic slip ups. Just was informed that again I must wait and I am already a week off my meds. As soon as I am able to fill my prescription I intend to switch doctors.<//Review>

This is the worst medical office I have ever been to. Took my daughter for an 8am appt, arrived 10 mins early. Everyone that came in after us was seen. At 845am they called my cell phone and said we missed our appt. I told them I was in the waiting room. 15 mins later still waiting. I approached incredibly rude receptionist who told me he forgot to check us in....no apology or anything. Then said we have to wait for the next appt at 945am!! We ended up leaving and not being seen.</Review>

Terrible Service, TURNED AWAY AS I WAS 15 MINUTES EARLY, YES, EARLY!!!

I was Scheduled to arrive at 7:15 to pick up my sons prescription. I live 45 minutes away and arrived at 7:00 and spoke to a very young African american male (tall, skinny & RUDE) was told i must reschedule as i was not 30 minutes early... I explained that my appointment is not until 7:15. He told me that i should have known that i was to be 30 minutes early not 15 (THIS WAS NEVER DISCLOSED TO ME)!!!

My husband called to speak to a supervisor (We believe was the child's mother), She told my husband, "15 minutes early for a appointment is actually LATE"!!! She then proceeded to tell him that if he doesn't like it then don't come back its not her problem.

TERRIBLE DR. OFFICE. WILL NEVER RETURN AND SUGGEST YOU DO NOT AS WELL!!!</review>

And it's one of the nicest, and functional, grocery store remodels I've ever seen.  So clean and well thought out.

<Time>1616603069176<//Time><rating>4</rating><Text>FoodMaxx has been my neighborhood grocery store for over 30 years. They have always pretty much had what I needed when I needed it. The Meat Dept. has always been pretty good. Along with their dairy products and frozen foods. They recently rearranged the entire layout of the store. For those of us who have been shopping here for as long as I have...the change was life altering...LOL! I could tell you where anything was in that store until they rearranged and upgraded the coolers and freezers. I knew it was coming. It's more of a joke than actually being affected by the change. The store looks great and flows better than before. They are a good neighborhood store.<//Text>< Pictures>

Bigger aisles. A lot better at night. Not too many people are in there. The only complaint that I have is the electric scooters going over the bumps in the parking lot. Had to get off and push the cart over the road bump😂< /Text>

<Text>Is it so complicated to hire some cashiers? I come in at 8 a.m. and have to wait in a 30-minute line because there's only one cashier open. Your guys's profits have increased exponentially since the virus and you can't provide a fast customer experience because of lack of employees when you're overwhelming prophets are obvious sad<//Text><user_name>HASTE< /user_name>< GmapID>

Very disappointed they don’t have the mama rosas pizza box no more ! I’ve been looking for the past 3 months . Also they need to get rid of their sunny side brand of shredded  cheese and have more of their jack Monterrey shredded cheese it’s way better.</Review>

< Review>
This location is extremely well maintained, and every shelf is stocked and the entire store is almost perfectly organized. Kudos to the security guard who stood strong against a woman not wearing a mask for the safety of the customers and the staff around 6:30 tonight!!<//Review>

<review>The employees are willing to help you find items if you can't find what you are looking for.
The item prices are very competitive to other grocery stores.
I like the ample parking close to the front entrance.
Checking out is a breeze. No long waiting.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

The store is great. The cashiers are friendly. The service is great. It's a great store, but it takes forever to get out. They never open new lines when it's busy. You stand there in a line 10 miles long to cash out. I would give this store a 5 star rating, but I hate waiting in a line for 15 min just to buy 3 items.<//text>

I shop here when I'm in a pinch, just need a few things quickly. My OCD tends to kick in as the place is slightly disorganized. The cashier's are slightly on the slow side but really friendly mind you. 4 stars from me for being rather disorganized but besides that a good place to shop. You can't beat the prices either when compared to OTHER places.< /text>

One of my favorite grocery stores, this particular location only. Always neat and clean, the layout has remained the same for years making items easy to find. Staff is courteous, and lines progress fairly quickly. Definitely recommend for your shopping<//Review>

They open up more registers the moment they see few people stacking up in  the lines. They keep up price checks from other places and then lower the price. Produce section is fresh and great presentations.< /text>< pictures>

<Text>One of my first experiences visiting FoodMaxx. Selections very good prices, well, some things are phenomenally discounted, but then others???? You have to know what price you have paid in the past. I can't remember ever seeing anything out of stock, especially the things that they are advertising a sale price on.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Prices are hit and miss. Careful what you buy. Some things are way cheaper than Walmart or winco, and some are alot more expensive. Building is clean and well kept though and at least it isn't full of mexicans with thier giant throngs of screaming kids.</review>

<Text>Everything was fine about this store, we just found that some of the pre packaged beef we bought was turning a neon green/yellow, I thought it was because it might be old but the ham that we bought was also turning the same weird colors. I am not sure what to make of it, we didn't return the meat because by the time we saw it we had thrown out our receipt<//Text>< Pics>

There is a law in Santa Barbra County that face masks are to be worn in public buildings, apparently the store on North Broadway has failed to enforce this law....I will not be shopping there any longer.<//text>

Good during the day but I wouldn’t go grocery shopping with my kids after 8:30, to many drunk people and it gets ghetto and rude in line. Also the lines are toooo long and usually have to cashiers open sometimes 3 , but if they see the lines long they should right away open another one<//Text>

<Review>SOME PRICES ARE A BIT HIGH BUT NOT TOO BAD. IF YOU SAVE YOUR RECEIPT AFTER YOU CHECK OUT THERE IS SOME KIND OF SURVEY THAT ALLOWS YOU TO HAVE 5% OFF YOUR NEXT PURCHASE UP TO EITHER $100 OR $200.  THE STORE IS USUALLY VERY CLEAN. THE PLACES I SHOP ARE USUALLY FOODMAX SINCE ITS SO CLOSE AND COSTCO, WALMART, FOODCO, AND WINCO. EVEN THOUGH FOODMAXX HAS SOON HIGHER PRICES ITS USUALLY NOT ALL THAT MUCH HIGHER THAN ELSEWHERE AND WIT H THAT 5 PERCENT OFF COUPON ITS NOT TOO BAD AT ALL. THIS STORE HAS PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING. IT IS A VERY BIG STORE. QUITE BIG.< /Review><user_name>Jason “Jase”<//user_name><pictures>None< /pictures><Gmap_id>0x80ea41de9944f39b:0x82dab880add58891</Gmap_id><Date>1563705513758<//Date>< userid>

Lines are always long. I also went to cash in my lottery ticket. Assistant manager didn't seem to know how to use machine. He printed out another ticket. I said it was ok I didn't mind. But he insisted he did it wrong and said to come back in couple hours for the employee who normally does those transactions. I just looked at him and said for a $1 I said forget it. Just keep it. And left. If your not sure how to use it, tell me, I would of gone elsewhere!</Review>

< Text>
The prices are cheap and the workers are nice but that's about all this store has going for it. Most  of the clientele are combo of ghetto trash and  thieves. The store is really dirty especially the bathrooms. There is writing all over the bathroom walls and most of the time they are really dirty with human waste on the floor and walls. And alot of the baskets are broken.< /Text>

< review>
I go there every day the people are nice they know me by name I know their faces the store is clean I've never had any problems but today I went in there and they had eggs that have expiration date for today and the other eggs expirations for the 14th and 22nd of this month when I asked about it they told me that that's all they had so that was pretty odd for them because I had never seen that before hopefully they will see this post and rotate their eggs better for the expiration date I know the eggs are still good but eggs that expired on the 7th of April should not be sitting on the shelves</review>
