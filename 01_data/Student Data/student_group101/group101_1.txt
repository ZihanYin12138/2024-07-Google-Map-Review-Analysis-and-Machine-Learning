All five stars over all because the nails were amazing so were the employees, they were so nice and sweet!! Loved this place definitely going back! Waited a couple mins before getting seated and since I was there with a friend they did our nails at the same time, took about two hours top but the amazingly crazy part is that it went by so fast it didn’t even feel like two hours because of their strategy used. Very smart and amazing and again definitely going back.</text>

< review>
I tried to speak with the employees and manager about the charges they had and they said I would have to speak with each individual who did our nails.They have no records and will not produce a receipt for you upon request. How they’re maintaining their accounting records and reporting to the IRS, I have no idea. Honestly, if this establishment closes due to tax fraud, I wouldn’t be surprised.

They charged us $160 dollars and they didn’t want to give us a little extra lotion. Even after we tipped $5 per person who helped us. DEFINITELY not worth your money. It’d be cheaper for you to drive to LA, pay for gas, and get a quality spa day. Including the service. I got yelled at by two associates for asking to see what the break down was and for requesting a receipt. Basically, since I already paid, I wasn’t worth being treated like a customer any longer.

Ultimately, it’s just our fault for choosing this place. We won’t be going here again. I hope you find a place that treats you and your nails right.</review>

Owners may be somewhat polite but they don't always have your best interest in mind. My nails had started growing fungus and the owner and nail tech told me it's because I wash my hands too much.... Thank goodness they have some sweet Hispanic employees who attempted to help. Went there for at least 3 years.</Text>

Went in for a gel pedicure and gel manicure. Asked for gel pedicure and got a regular polish, took forever, and a squiggly smile line. Pedicure didn't even last a week. My feet were red and itchy a few days after I had to use an anti fungal cream because I got athletes foot from the pedicure. Went and sat with another girl for my gel manicure. She shaved down my nails like she was doing acrylics which is a NO NO. I asked for French tip and it looked like a small child did the smile line or someone with Parkinson's did my nails. I ended up with an easier designthe girl could do.<//text>

<review>I went with my 10 yr old daughter to get a manicure with gel color and a pedicure with gel color and for myself a pedicure with gel color. 3 different people did our nails...The man who did my daughters manicure did a great job (friendly and took his time), the lady who did her pedicure took 5 minutes with just a single coat plus didnt put her feet under UV light instead put a small fan only and her nails begin to crack instantly and I told her she just fixed one so I kept pointing out the rest and she just ignored me. I was so upset because I expected her to do a job I paid for instead I get cracked/chipped and thin layer look. That Lady is just for the money and has HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE by ignoring us paying customers. Then she kept telling my daughter stop touching your feet together as if that would ruin the POOR JOB she already did right when we were paying. Gel nails are supposed to be dry and smudge proof!!!!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80952f2f8afe1ab3:0x5980ad2b4899bdc3<//GmapID></record>

Customer service is bad. I called and said i wanted a pedi with gel,signed in for a pedi with gel/ wax until i found out they dont do wax so i told them i want the 40 dollar pedi with gel and they took it into there own hands to charge me for the delux which i never asked for and then said if i want gel i have to pay 10 more dollars. Then they wanted to give me attuide when i told them that i never wanted the delux i just wanted a pedi with gel. They misunderstood me and then want me to pay for there mess up. I have never been treated the way they treated me today if they would pay attention to what there customers want and pay attention while they are doing your nails intead of talking back and fourth to eachother they would of heard me say gel multiple times,they wouldnt of cut two of  my toes and file like as if i was getting arclics  and they wouldnt of did such a bad job with my polish. WORST NAIL PLACE I HAVE EVER BEEN TO.<//Text>

The lady named Linda, was awful. She asked me how I wanted my toes done and when I told her she did the complete opposite. And when I pulled my foot away from her , because she was hurting me, she jerked my foot back and kept filing my toe and just stared at me. I will NEVER go back to her again. Worst experience ever. 👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼 for Linda<//Text>

I went early this morning at 9:25 am to have my nails done because my friend referred me to this place bec they are good and walk ins are welcome.so me and my daughter went here only to be told that i need to make an appointment first and everybody calls in first before they come.i look at the sign on their door it says walks ins welcome.the guy who shooed me away was very rude.MONEY is coming to your doorway and u just threw money away.zero customer service!! I was never in my entire life experience this kind of customer service.i guess only here in this town. I always go to socal in west covina to have my nails done and never they turn away a customer.< /Text>

This place sucks, I went in on Thursday for a full set, I asked for black gel polish,  the lady didn't polish my nails right and my Monday the color started chipping. One nail broke 3 days after I got them done. These people don't do nails like they used to, it's like they don't care about the customer or the nail job just the money. I won't be returning.<//Text>

<user_name>Kristy Cortez< /user_name><Date>1611359817518<//Date><Rate>5</Rate><review>Very happy with the shop. Clean shop with experienced barbers. Barber Mark is outstanding. The rest of the barbers should focus a little more on the customer when providing their service. Don't get me wrong they cut great hair and you won't get a better cut anywhere, but my son's barber clicked off his clippers 63 times so he could participate in a conversation across the shop. He turned a 20 minute haircut into a 43 minute cut. Again, his cut turned out great, but it was frustrating to see him about to cut my son's hair, then stop, turn of his clippers, talk for a few minutes about sports or a bet, then cut a little hair, and then do it all over again. Their time is valuable and their prices are more than fair for a great cut, but the customer's time is important too. That being said, I think I will only be going to Mark, he is nice, clean, focused, friendly, and most of all very professional.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

What is the point to make an appointment at 9 if you as a barber are going to arrive at 9:20 and you’re going to attend someone that has his appointment after you
The customer service by Micke at the beginning is no so good, he has so much talent but he is kinda agresive maybe is not his intention, I don’t know
The talent is obvious they are amazing in what they are doing I’m not giving 5 because of the waiting even with appointment<//Review>

First and foremost this place cuts amazing hair! Every barber knows what they are doing and the atmosphere is friendly and safe. The shop is clean and tidy. I do not agree with a previous review saying that no barber wore a mask, several were wearing masks. But in all honesty there were some without masks. I get it, it is hard to remain open in a COVID world, and its even harder to stick to wearing a mask all day, but in my opinion all employees and all customers should be wearing masks. If you are uncomfortable with barbers not wearing masks, like the owner said, you should have left. This is a great shop with good people. Perhaps the owner will tighten up his employees' mask wearing to protect their customers.< /Text>

Walking in the first thing you notice is that it's really clean , as soon as I signed the walk in sheet I was helped , got my cut by Keith who did a great job. Everyone's chill here occasionally cracking jokes to break the ice would recommend  this place to anyone in The IE.<//text>

< review>
I’ve been to this place probably 5 times now and I’ve finally have had enough. First two times were great haircuts with Mark and the guy with the big full beard but then it was a nightmare the remaining times but not from the barbers mentioned. Today was another one of those cases that I wish I learned from the previous two bad experiences. I told the barber do not line up my hair in the front with my slight widows peak, mid haircut he hands me the mirror and the haircut looked fine. But then afterwards he decides to cut more on the front part of my hair, and cut down my windows peak like half the length of the rest of my hair. It looks ridiculous especially if I try to put my hair up in the front. The man contributed to my last bad haircut as well. Didn’t realize he would do that and didn’t think anything of it until I got home and saw it. Poor listening skills as I told him not to touch it.< /review>

This business is not COVID safe. I’ve known people that have had COVID including people in my own household and it is not something people should take lightly. Signature Fades’ employees do not enforce masks and they do not wear them. Every single employee did not wear a mask. The one employee that had a mask on was wearing it incorrectly under his nose.</review>

Did not get the hair cut we wanted.
Was walk in, but were ignored and not attended right away.
Seems like the girl was new and unskilled
Left unsatisfied and had to go to a different shop to re fix the job. And pay again.
Never coming back.< /review>

Never ever leave disappointed. They are great with kids and they are very welcoming. Can get busy sometimes so always try to make appointments, but you know what they say about a place that’s always busy!
I’m so happy I found this place.
The interior is always clean as well.
I don’t think I’ll ever go anywhere else.
The owner is fantastic with his cuts and the rest of the crew follows behind with great cuts.
Highly recommend!!!< /Text>

<Review>Needed a new place to get a good cut. Drove from Redlands to try this spot out and really loved it. Y.O. takes care of you as a customer. You can tell they all take their time with giving a good quality haircut. Usually I've been to places where they sit you down, cut snip and have you leave quick. But this shop, it's much more thought put into your hair. Very clean and cool decor around the shop. Good music was bumpin when I was getting my hair cut.  Cool little shop and worth the drive for me. I'd recommend them to all my friends and family.<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

Keith did such a great job on my haircut! As a woman going inside a barbershop I've always been uncomfortable but as soon I sat down he held a conversation with me and made me feel really comfortable, I showed him a design and he did it the same exact way and some, the atmosphere was amazing. everyone was friendly. I love this place and I'll definitely be back :) thank you so much Keith</text>

Love the new shop. Everyone is very friendly and welcoming. And honestly seems like everyone at the shop could cut good. The reason i started going to the shop is for my boy Jimmy hes definitely one of the best barbers in the Inland Empire. He always takes his time and is very professional. I always get out his chair feeling satisfied with the fresh cuts he gives</review>

He exhibits Great customer service As well as professionalism when serving his clients. I don’t just trust anyone cutting my hair as my hair is curly and course and a bit difficult to manage but with magic Jimmy gets the job done. I’m always satisfied when leaving the shop.  I receive compliments on the daily after I get my haircut by him.  Stop by the shop you won’t be letdown!!<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Response>

<review>This place is the BEST looking barber shop in San Bernardino. Mornings during the week is the best time to get a cut.  Friday's and the weekend are extremely busy.  Glad to finally have a nice barber shop in North End San Bernardino.<//review>< time>

LEFT VERY FRUSTRATED. I've heard great things about them so I decided to give them a shot. I called ahead & asked if I can use my student discount for my son & they said I could. My boyfriend & I took our son in and they left him practically BALD and then they told me I couldn't use my discount. Overpaid for a horrible haircut & they lazily covered my son so his hair got all over my boyfriend. Never coming back again.<//text>

I made an appointment for 4pm but i went in at 2:30pm cause I was free & he began the haricut, like 20-30minutes later someone came in cause he had an appointment with Mark at 3, he was like half way being done with mine & he ended up just working on the top a little & he said he's done & charged me 21$, i was exhausted that day and the haircut looked good but coming home i noticed the sides weren't even & i expected the top to not be good and it wasn't good but still, if he knew he had an appointment 30minute he shouldn't have took me in. 21$ for some beard trim and some taper work is not worth it & i will not be coming in again. Doesn't even look like a i got a haircut</Review><pics>None</pics>< Rating>

The Epitome of haircuts 💇‍♂️ , I been coming to YO for 6 years and always get the best cuts everytime never a disappointment. 5 Star quality. Great service, Great Vibes, I recommend this shop to everybody. Great Music, professional barbers always laughing and keeping the vibes fun with a great experience. Wherever you live or reside, you need a fresh cut you come to this shop. #ShowCaseBarbers 5 Star Barbers
All ages all the time 7 days a week, if you need to look fresh even if you’re in a rush they will take care of you. Yousef AKA YO, Jeremy, Keith, Mark, Jimmy, Larry and Jerry they all got you.< /Review>

Really nice porch to hang out and enjoy an evening amongst the redwoods. Unfortunately, the restaurant was closed so we weren't able to try it out.<//text>< Pics>

The atmosphere with the the town bar and dancing floor was really nice.  Open and airy table to eat at next to the window in the restaurant, but the food was very disappointing.  Ordered the chicken enchiladas and steak tacos.  The food was so bad, I didn't eat more than one bite...and my husband could only get a quarter of the way through his meal.  Went back to the in hungry and sad😢</text>

< Review>
Worst bar in Southern  Humboldt. This place is not friendly. Came to eat at the restaurant. The Server got three out of six of the orders wrong and then ignored us the rest of the night. When we went to the bar to order drinks because the waitress was ignoring us, the female bartender was extremely rude and told us we couldn't order at the bar if we were eating at the restaurant. Then while we were eating the owner or manager came in and told us that a band was starting we needed to pay $10 cover charge or get out of the restaurant. We paid the cover charge and then he came back and ID everyone while we were still eating. One of our party didn't have ID so we all had to leave and he refused to give us the cover charge  back even though he was kicking us out for not having ID while we were just trying to eat and the band never even started playing.<//Review>

< Review>
(Translated by Google) Located on the iconic avenue of the giants. The variety of drinks they have is very good, the food is very tasty and the people are very friendly.
They have arcade games, two pool tables, rockola and a mini stage for local bands.
They also have a place with tables outside where you can breathe fresh air from the redwoods.
Super recommended!

Tambien tienen un lugar con mesas afuera donde puedes salir a respirar aire puro de los redwoods.
Super recomendable!<//Review>

<Pictures>None</Pictures><date>1611173802895< /date><review>We had an appointment for a cleaning and check. When we got there, they cleaned and said the units were working.  We never got to talk to the Doctor, Ashley,  as she was busy with another appointment.  I explained to the receptionist that we had waited for 5 months for the appointment and there was a continuous ring in my elderly mother's ear. He told me he wasn't a doctor so he could only clean the units and our appointment didn't include speaking with the doctor.  Unacceptable! I explained to him we have an appointment and ours is as valid as any other appointment.  I told him we would wait as long as it for the Doc to finish the appointment ahead of us. I am sorry they did not allow enough time for our appointment.  In the end, after all of us being flustered, he did the best he could. I was disappointed and did not feel valued.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I'd give 0 or negative star if these are permitted. Given the perspective that I've never given any other places lower than 3* before.
I booked a free hearing test appointment for my mom based on the positive reviews of this place, and Aaron Gabrielson is the hearing test tech.
Before he performed any tests, he was trying to push us for commitment of "treatment" -- either surgery or equipment. I told him that we were there for hearing test, and open to discuss the treatment plan, but we were not going to make any decision on the spot. He raised his voice, and try to push for commitment to sign up treatment before any tests were done. I repeated several times what we were there for, he was louder and louder, and my mom said he could lower his voice. He then said, her ear was OK, didn't need to be tested. Since he has not interest to perform hearing test which was what we went there for, so we agreed to leave. I then asked him to return our personal information which was on the forms we filled in, he refused, and said that we his property, and thread to call police.
I understand business is trying to sell things to make money, but not in this way. He is the rudest person I've ever encountered in my life, and I really don't understand how this place got all the 5 stars from.</Text>< pics>

Lorie, not sure where to begin in response to this review. I guess I’m surprised that if your experience was that negative, why would you try to book another test with me another two separate times at two different locations? Maybe it was because you seemed more interested in the gift card that day than even a test for your mother? I am not sure where you felt “pressured” to do anything. I asked your Mother directly if she felt that she had a hearing loss which she responded “no” to. Also I asked her if she was interested in even being tested, in which she also responded “no” as well. After that you asked again about the gift card, and potential treatments for hearing loss. I first answered your questions about potential treatments for hearing loss, by this point your mother was already walking out of my office because she was not interested in a test. You seemed to be frustrated by this. Then you asked me for the gift card (again), in which you responded with anger. At that point you demanded your mother’s patient intake form which I said I couldn’t release without patient consent, and because she left I didn’t have that. At that point you grabbed the patient folder off my desk and ran to your car. In my years of service as a Hearing Specialist I have never had an appointment go like this. Apparently it was bewilderedering for all involved. I wish you and your mother the best and I apologize for any miscommunication on my part.<//text>

I have been to numerous Audiologists and Hearing Specialists and by far Aaron Gabrielsen is the best I've ever worked with. I didn't want to admit I had a problem but overtime I got sick of missing out on conversations especially in social situations. Aaron was able to help diagnose my hearing loss and educate me on the different hearing aids that would help me. I was able to find one that I could afford and more importantly THAT WORKS!</Review>

Amazing, courteous, friendly and sincere service! These people are true definition of customer service. This is coming from someone who is also in health industry and knows what true customer service is! Rachelle, Shaun and Spencer are professional, know what they are doing and will accommodate you to ensure you are happy and satisfied with their services. And most importantly, they do it all with a smile and friendly attitude. I am glad I found this place and would highly recommend it to anyone that has hearing aid needs. Thank you!</Text>

By far the best health care facility I have EVER been to. The level of care, customer service and knowledge is unmatched. I highly recommend this office to anyone looking for long term hearing care solutions. Shaun and Rachell do a tremendous job making you feel like family and addressing your needs. If I could give a 10 star review I would. They truly are that good.<//Review>

I have had hearing aids for over 20 years and this is hands down the best place I have been. Their hearing aids are of the highest quality but their customer service is where they really shine. Rachell (an avid Warriors fan)  goes above and beyond to make you feel at home and comfortable. Shaun will blow you away with his knowledge, care and professionalism.<//Review>

Spencer, at the Cupertino office, is very professional and very good at making sure a customers needs are met.  He is a real pleasure to work with.

On my first visit, I was quite amazed at the testing and hearing aid programming process.  Being an electrical engineer familiar with frequency response measurements during school, it was fascinating seeing the programmed response curve being overlaid on the measurement data.  What is truly amazing is how natural the sound is.  I almost forget that I am wearing them sometimes.</Review>< Gmap_id>

<text>My 93 year old mother has been a client of the Cupertino office for over three years.  Everyone in the office has been amazing.  Very friendly, attentive and service oriented.  They go the extra mile to make sure you are happy while you're there and when you leave.  Rachell is amazing.  She is so professional and truly cares about the clients.  Shaun is a great new asset to the office.  Spencer's shoes were going to be hard to fill, but Shaun has done an excellent job of carrying on the office tradition of care and compassion.  I highly recommend this office.</text>< user_name>

<Name>Jacob Levy<//Name><time>1562652051345<//time><rate>5</rate><Text>Before getting into the review itself, I should say I am very pleased with every aspect of Miracle Ear the company and the product, as well as my experience with the staff at the office -- they made the process simple, smooth, and easy, and the hearing aids I got are the best I've ever had. I'm 64 and now after all these years I feel I'm hearing better than when I was a teenager.

No product is perfect, of course; however  these hearing aids are so much better than the product I bought 8 years ago, it's amazing -- they're really opening up new opportunities for having a better social life.

I bought a top-line pair of hearing aids from the Miracle Ear office in Cupertino, CA. Before choosing this company I did a *lot* of research, and I called several local providers to get an appointment. Miracle Ear was the first and only one I went to, because they convinced me in one session that their hearing aid was the right one for me.

I was helped by Aaron Gabrielson. Aaron started by finding out about my needs, and did a free hearing test right there on the spot as part of the first visit. The results were that I was suffering from significant hearing loss, and these results matched the profile I obtained from my audiologist in the Palo Alto Medical Foundation.

Aaron answered all my questions and was extremely professional, knowledgeable, and also very enjoyable to work with. I feel that he and Rachel really care about my needs and work hard to produce exceptional results for me. Over the follow-up visits (see below) I got to know them better and I really like them -- exceptional professionals and warm people.

The great thing about Miracle Ear is that they do not just sell you hearing aids and forget about you. Instead, they pretty much require you to come in for a series of follow up visits that start once you get your hearing aids, and during these visits Aaron fine-tuned the hearing aids to better match what my hearing loss requires. This is a process whereby your ears and brain get "retrained" to process all the new information that your ears hear. Aaron was always polite, respectful and very helpful.

As with everything, there are some negatives as well. The most significant I'll mention is the price. The hearing aids I bought are the most expensive ones I've ever purchased. Very expensive. But once you consider everything I got, the value is exceptional -- I am now hearing much better than I've ever had, since being a teenager, the time my hearing loss started. The technology is really cutting edge and produces exceptional amplification of what you WANT to hear while suppressing background noises. And the follow-up program and periodic tuning, plus the gradual approach taken, is based on recognizing that people need some adjustment time, and most cannot tolerate the huge jump in what they hear all at once. I believe this approach results in much better results.

I'll close by saying that I've been talking the ears off everyone who will listen (and some people that did not want to listen) about getting hearing aids and recommending the Cupertino office. Two thumbs up!</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

<Review>This is my first hand experience dealing with Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) - Gregg Olsen, Mike Olsen and Amplifon (“Parent Company”)

***I highly encourage anyone reading this review to NOT DO BUSINESS WITH Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear)***

The evidence in this matter reveals the original Purchase Agreement lacks at a minimum, and in pertinent part - the required signature(s) of the customer, required dates, required accept/decline of Supplemental Warranty, and the required signature(s) of Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) consultant(s)/employee(s). This is not a valid contract.

A refund for the defective hearing aids was requested within the 45 day required timeframe (by law), and Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) refused the return, as well as the refund request. Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) refused the return within the 45 days and stated that we must keep them for 6 months or more and until such time that the device(s) would likely work properly.

We have made every reasonable attempt (in writing and by phone) to resolve this matter directly with Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear), and they simply offered for us to keep the defective hearing aids, sell them on the open market, or "...wait until the health insurance resets and purchase new hearing aids..." from them Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear).

Health Services Bay Area, LLC (d.b.a., Miracle-Ear) has acted illegally, unethically, and immorally in this case.<//Review>< Pictures>

My experience  was fine although  it took almost an hour activating  2 phones. I just felt kinda bad for the 2 people waiting behind me so long. I truly hope I  do not ever have to wait that long for service.< /Review>

<Name>Jesse Castrejon< /Name><Text>I decided to try a sprint regardless of how horrible I heard the service was. Upon walking in a understood why. Walked in and wasn’t greeted or even told to hold on a little they will be with me soon. I understand they had customers but a greeting and letting a customer know that they are there goes a long was especially in customer service. Was there for 20 minutes walking around and still wasn’t told nothing. Didn’t even acknowledge I was there. Never coming back here again.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><user>108864663364863975981<//user>< GmapID>

<text>This is my 4th bad experiences with Sprint. I have one more phone has payment on my plan. I will switch to other company once I pay it off.
I purchased a new iPhone and I asked to convert my phone number to the new phone. I went to the store in Arden mall and they asked for $30 plus tax to activate the new phone. I rejected to pay because I am not adding a new number, I just wanted to use my same number on the new phone. I chatted with customer service for almost 50 mins, then I lost the connection, so I chatted for another customer agent for 45 mins. Then They asked me to go to Sprint store on 4848 Madison Ave, and they mentioned that they will leave a note for them.
I went their and the lady in the store said that they do not have any notes in their system and she will need to check my account on their system. Then she rejected to assist me because I have a Pennsylvania ID. She said that only California ID should be used as identify doc per Sprint policy.
I called the customer service. They said that nothing should prevent me to use PA ID in a store in CA.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Some of the good reviews are from the employees of this store, not real customers/ visitors. They don't have a clear policy. One says something, then the other one says something else. I went to this store 3 times to switch from Cricket, today, they asked me for my social security even though I am just switching not leasing any phones. I got my own phone. A week ago, they said they didn't need my social since I am leasing a phone. The African American supposedly Sales associate has zero customer service skills. She seems to be forced to work in this store. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME GOING THERE ... I wish we had minus zero star option.<//Text>

Devon was so helpful and professional! He made sure I was getting the best deal possible and even called me to come back when he found another promotion for me. He made switching from Verizon, which I had been with for 12 years, very easy and definitely worth it. I would trust him and definitely come back for the service. Thank you!</text>

<text>I went to this store after being educated on what was a Corporate Store vs. Franchise owned store.  I was able to return my phones which were purchased in another store and I was able to replace them.  I also opened a 5th line.  The manager was very knowledgeable and directed me in the right direction.  I would definitely buy from them again.  Ask a lot of questions.  They can answer them.</text><response>None<//response>< user_name>

Fantastic service! These guys understand customer service. Special thanks to Gary Morse for taking the extra steps and answering my questions. I'm not an amateur with phones and Gary's expertise helped me choose the LGv20. 1st non galaxy phone since the 1st galaxy phone almost a decade ago.
-EDIT
on my last visit computers were down. I got more help from the 800 number< /Text>

I walked out of here without getting any service. I was greeted by a worker behind the counter when I walked in so I know he saw me.  After waiting about 20 minutes while he took care of a customer he proceeds to ignore the fact that I had been waiting the longest and help someone who had walked in just a few minutes prior. There was only 1 other employee and she was on the floor helping someone. I will not return to this store and I will tell everyone I know to avoid it.< /Review>

<Date>1421786014795< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating><Review>I went into the Auburn Corporate store to change my phone plan to a current plan. A rep name Brandy ask why I came in, and I explained. She was not friendly at all. I told her that I have an old plan which has limited Data on each phone, and wanted to change to something new like a family share plan. She said she could not change my plan unless I add another Tablet to my Acct. When I told her I already have one Tablet in my Acct. Brandy said, either I add another Tablet to my family plan or she can not change the plan for me. She said it was a store policy. Really?! If I can not change my plan at the Sprint Corporate store, is this good customer service?  From beginning to the end, Brandy was cold and very very unfriendly with an "I don't care" attitude. I think she needs a customer service training again. I am seriously considering changing my phone company.< /Review>< Pictures>

The store is not far from where we live so it makes it very convenient. I was having some issues with memory on my Android phn w/a slide down keyboard-love my phn! On 3/21/14, I was assisted by: JEROME GRICE who did an awesome job of restoring my phn and then explaning everything to us (which app was taking up the most memory, etc). Basically it comes down to the fact that my phn is four yrs old and that is old for a phn, especially for how much I need/use it. There are not many phns that have a slide out keyboard, so I will have to just face the fact that if I want a new phn I'll have to adjust to changing technology. But the store is great and my Service Provider was awesome. When I buy my new phn, I will go back to this location.  When I called the store to find out how to do this review, KELBY assisted me. He, too, was awesome. I have Epilepsy and it always takes a couple extra minutes to explain things 'cuz I have to write stuff down due to my own memory issues :-)< /text>

This is a decent older park. It has tad bark vs. a rubbery ground cover. It has two regular swings, two baby swings. The play structure is best suited for kids 4-5 +. My daughter is almost 2 and she can manage the stairs to the main slides, which are steep, but she's brave. Some other features she just too little for. There's a small slide but it has a rough texture so you don't really slide on it. This is my closest park, so we go here when we are short on time. There is lots of open space around the play area with nice picnic tables. There's no bathrooms. It's clean and kept up.< /Text>

My dog loves to play on the grass at the park - he runs around on his flexi leash. The grass has come back nicely and the park is clean. Although I don't use it the play equipment looks fun and is well maintained.< /Text>

Wonderful local park with plenty of space, picnic area, shade, and a play structure.  Much like many other parks in Livermore and a reliable place for all your park needs!< /review>

Nice park, the new landscaping is coming along very well. I do wish that people would pick up after their dogs - I had my dog there and got tired of picking up other people's dog's mess! If we don't clean up after our dogs the park will soon be "No Dogs Allowed" which would be a shame.< /Text>

Zumiez does not even deserve one star. I just went into this store with my two friends but i'll never be coming back in here again.

We walked in only to be bombarded by at least 4 sales associates telling us about the deals, which we had to repeatedly hear about 4 separate times. It seems like they are really forcing help upon customers which makes me think they work on commission, but I'm not sure. We asked where the swimsuits were and the employee spent a few minutes asking other employees where they were before realizing they didn't sell any (weird). My friend picked up an air freshener that she planned on buying and went to the back of the store to look at the men's graphic tees to find something else to purchase with the air freshener.

At this point a fifth sales associate came and started complimenting my other friends chains, to a point of harassment.  He started to bring shirts for my friend to "compliment" his chains, and at this point we were so uncomfortable that my friend put down her air freshener on a pile of clothes and walked out, so she would not have to talk to other employees during the checkout process. It was annoying to say the least. I have never felt so pressured to buy clothes before.

We walked out of the store and this employee who was some sort of undercover loss protection (longish hair and in late 20s/early 30s, i hope she's reading this) comes running after us and holds her hand out and says "Air freshener?" as if assuming we stole the air freshener. At this point I realize the workers weren't even trying to be helpful, they were trying to make conversation to tell if we were trying to steal or not.  My friend said she "left it on a pile of clothes" because she DID. The worker said, in the most condescending tone may i add, "would you like to show me where you put it?" My friend showed her the table she left it on and the worker looked almost disappointed that she had been proven wrong. She proceeded to say, "next time hand the item to us or put it back where you got it from if you don't want it." When have you ever heard a retail employee say "put that back where you got it from"? The workers are getting paid to keep the store looking tidy, it's not the customer's job. And if it is the customer's job, Zumiez, maybe make sure your workers aren't so pushy they're repelling customers from the store. If Zumiez is trying to lose business they're doing a great job. There were also way too many workers standing around and trying to push deals, which just reminds me how much I hate coming to the mall.

If you didn't read the whole thing, here's the takeaways:
-way too many pushy employees.
-management is rude and condescending and obviously has nothing better to do than accuse teenagers of stealing.<//review>< Pictures>

<review>I always enjoy going to Zumiez!  I really like this location they have a lot of different clothes and a good stock in sizes!    We were greeted at the front when we first walked in and were asked if we needed any help or were looking for anything specific. I don’t have my teenagers with me and I’m going in here I’m usually looking to see what sales are what they have for them sometimes I find something for myself I really like all the different designers because the designers that they carry are very artistic and the staff is edgy. For myself I really enjoy sketchy tank allot!  I love the skulls and the art work!  my son likes empire that may have changed by now. My boyfriend loves primitive as he loves their hoodies and artwork.  I would deathly come back to this location since they were such a nice store clean and great staff.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1576008495296, 'text': 'Awesome!

We tried a few weeks back but unfortunately the food here turned out to be a big disappointment. The problem was the Kabuli palao with lamb which was supposed to be a speciality.  The rice was under cooked and the lamb smelled really really bad to the point that we could not eat it and had to throw it away.  The lamb may have been too old or expired to be smelling that horrible.  To be fair the other dish (beef kebob) was decent.  However cannot rely on a place where one out of two dishes needs to be thrown away.  Sorry hope it was just a one off but what you offer as a special dish has to be perfect and fresh.<//text>

The best Gyros I can find in San Diego county. Kofta is my second go to. Lamb kabob if you are in to that sort of thing (I am.) Their chicken kabob is delicate, and surprisingly flavorful. I'd give six stars however you know I'd have to work for Google to do that, that is another story.< /review>

The food here is simply delicious. If you've never been, you need to put it on your list. Our young grandkids can't get enough of this food too. We drive about 15 miles to eat here and it's worth every mile. The food is so fresh and only cooked to order. Don't miss out on Baba Kabob. The only regret you'll have is if you don't go. Enjoy!</text>

After a series of unfortunate events we stopped here as a last dinner resort. We were very happy with the food and flavor and quality of service. Rice was warm and moist, aromatic. Chicken was hot and moist and the salad with dressing was right amount of flavor.<//review>

<review>The best gyros I've had in San Diego. The gyro sandwich is excellent on all points: the meat is well spiced, veggies are fresh, and sauce is creamy and delicious. Their baklava is great as well; you could really just stop by to pick up just an order of them. The employees are also very friendly, which makes this place even more inviting. I'm excited to come back and try more of their food.<//review><gmapID>0x80dbfbb962206ba9:0xa6776b675476e93b< /gmapID>< time>

Amazing food. I got the chicken kabob plate. The chicken was seasoned and tender, the warm tender rice hit the spot and the salad cleansed the pallet. If you are hungry and want to be satisfied check out Baba Kabob!<//Review>

Was my favorite place love the food but it seems you don’t get pita bread with a gyro plate anymore. Pita is a must have for me, it’s like having a carne asada plate with no tortillas. No pita means I have to look for another restaurant because I love my gyro plates 😭. Love that they use basmati rice instead of that funky rice pilaf a lot of places serve. Please bring pita back to the gyro plate so I can come back soon.</Text>

First time here as passing through Poway. With 4.8 stars, I expected delicious food. Maybe I ordered the wrong things...Gyro Fries and a Schwarma salad. While the gyro meat was ok, it was drowned in tzaziki and feta cheese over barely cooked frozen fries. The salad wilted bagged iceberg under food dyed chicken. Yuck. Never again.<//text>

This is a small restaurant, but the food packs big flavor. Picked up lunch for takeout, and ordered chicken shawarma and falafel sandwiches, both generously portioned, excellently seasoned, and packaged perfectly. They are made to order, so you can order the fillings spicy, an option not available at most kabob places. The vegetables on the sandwich are chopped so that there is a balanced distribution of flavors, and the pita is soft and fluffy. I ordered extra tzatziki sauce, it is very good, not runny like most places- although the sandwiches are served with it on already.I was only able to eat half the sandwich for lunch, but when I came back to it as leftover, it retained its integrity and flavor wonderfully. We also picked up baklava available at the counter, as well as on their takeout menu- awesome! They are also customer service stars, which is why after delivering for them, I chose to order from them. If you are a fan of Mediterranean food, or like to try new cuisines, check out their menu, and authentic offerings. They are complying with Covid protocol, with takeout and delivery available now.< /Text>

I would give this place ZERO stars due to the fact that there was BUGS in me and my husband’s food. So nasty. First time ordering from here and that will be the last time<//Text>

<review>The food in this place is amazing. Last week I went there with some friends and we ordered a few different dishes to share. The beef kabob and chicken kabob is tender and cooked to perfection. By far the best kabob I have ever had. The kabobs melts in your mouth. We had both the potato and Leek Bolani, which is a flat bread filled with either leek or potato, they were out of this world; amazingly delicious (must try). The entire restaurant is sparking clean and it has a cute patio for outdoor dining. This place is MUST try.< /review><gmapID>0x80dbfbb962206ba9:0xa6776b675476e93b</gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures>< rate>

Baba Kabob has been open a couple of weeks, so we finally decided to give it a try.  We had the chive bolani and falafel sandwich.  Gotta say, the bolani was probably large enough to feed four people!  The bolani itself was piping hot, slightly crispy, and absolutely delicious.  We're looking forward to ordering the potato bolani next time.  Our sandwich was also fantastic, and filled with plenty of falafel balls.  The pita for the sandwich was perfectly fresh and slightly chewy. We're coming back!<//text>

Update: Went back the 2nd day and ordered the Chicken Katsu with Tempura veggies. Another home run. The portions were very generous and the food was delicious. Highly recommended.

Soledad is no culinary capital and so my expectation was low when we ordered the Bento and the chicken teriyaki bowl. Wow, it was surprisingly good. The presentation was good and the portion was very good. The food was hot and tasty. My combo Bento box came with shrimp tempura, salad and generous amount of chicken and beef. I really enjoyed them. My wife liked the bowl. Recommended.</review>

Delicious teriyaki bowls. We only had the chicken, but they offer dark or white meat. If you want dark meat, get there early. The Teriyaki sauce is sweet, garlicky and is terrific over the generous rice under your protein. We ate food from there 3 times in 8 days. I'd love to have some right now!!<//Text>

A hidden gem!!

I stumbled on Teriyaki Express as a complete "why not" moment and I'm happy to report it was a gamble I'm glad I took.

I tried just the safe can chicken teriyaki meal and while the cool time was a bit lengthy the food was more than worth the wait. What I can't express here enough is the freshness of the food itself! The broccoli perfectly crisp, the home made pickled cucumbers(a surprise delight as I hate cucumbers normally) and rice all delicious and with very generous portions! This isn't even counting much better than expected chicken. All and all it was incredible surprise and I've since gone around 4-5 times each time trying something new with different friends so they can also try for themselves (The tonkatsu is by far my favorite at this point).< /text>

Fresh and delicious chicken with rice and steamed veggies was a great healthy alternative on the road. Fast and inexpensive. Nice white meat chicken with just the right amount of teriyaki sauce.</Review>

Nice enough place with surprising items on the menu. Was not expecting Baby back ribs. Pretty meaty. Also had fried calamari. Not bad at all, just not really tempura like it said on the menu. Portions goodly sized. Hit the spot. Just not remarkable<//text>

Chicken bowl was delicious. Place was clean and quiet. Chicken was perfectly cooked, same with the rice. The vegetables were a little sparse, there were 2 carrots and 1 piece of broccoli. Overall would go again.<//Text>

<text>Fresh bento box. I pick and choose. Charge accordingly. Grilled short ribs and tempura shrimp are the best I have ever had. Chow mein and fresh salad, great sides. Reasonably priced. Take out or eat in. Clean and healthy. Family owned.< /text><Time>1538509587002</Time><rate>5< /rate>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Best teriyaki restaurant I have ever been to in every sense of the word. Amazing food, amazing customer service, quick turnaround.
I would rate this place more than 5 stars if I could.

Great small place with good chicken teriyaki.  The portions were large, so we split them with our small children.  Easy road trip stop.< /Text>

Pretty good highway stop for lunch.   Got the chicken teriyaki and fried pork combo platter.  The teriyaki was moist and tasty.   The pork a little dry but not bad.  It came with two balls of rice and steamed veggies (broccoli and carrots).   It seemed like a good healthy choice.   Plenty of food for two of us!<//review>

Heard from co workers about this place and decided to give it a try. Their food is more simplistic but that's what makes it good. Consistently fresh, made to order, and very filling. Items can be ordered as a bowl, plate or combination and plus, free refills on soda.</Text>

These guys are friendly, reasonably priced & consistently in stock. If they don't have something I'm looking for they note it and usually have it in the next time I stop by.< /Text>

<Review>This is a very good smoke shop with a very good variety of items. They have good service overall with friendly people. I had bought something that ended up being bad, no fault of theirs. It wasn't expired, but i guess was stored wrong. Anyway, i bought it at night, a little before they closed, but by the time i noticed it was bad, and went back, they were already closed. So I had to go back the next day, and after telling them what happened, they didn't remember me buying it, so it made it harder to help me. But then came up with an idea, asked if the cameras work, yes but the lady I was talking to said she didn't have access, but the owners do. Then was told they hardly come in, but she could ask them to check and see what they say. Didn't really seem like my issue was really going to get addressed or anything cuz it wasn't that big of an issue. I was told I could check back tomorrow and find out. I didn't come the next day cuz at first I forgot, and when I remembered, I didn't think if anything would be done about it, it wouldn't be done that fast cuz it wasn't that serious and I'm just one customer. Surprise, when I go back in 2 days later, she remembered me, cuz she brought it up, I wasn't even thinking about it or going to even mention it. But she said they checked and I could get a replacement or basically have it dealt with how I wanted. Really showing concern and that I had importance as a customer, even as just one customer. Customers that are important to them, every customer. They deserve an extra star in my book for that. 6 stars but since your only allowed to rate up to five stars for anyone, then 5⭐+ for them. And 2 👍👍 LOL
This really is one of my favorite smoke shops to go to. If you go there, after a while it will be one of yours too.< /Review>< Response>

Good customer service is one of the most important characteristics a business can have and this place has it. Thank you to the night staff at Cigarette Depot you should be consultants to other businesses on good customer service.<//Review>

A dangerous place to get smokes. A guy tried to cut in line and then threatened me. Was worried he might pull out a knife. And the cashier didn't even do anything about it. A cigarette isn't worth risking my life over.<//Review>

Jesus from Elite Rooter was very helpful. They allowed us to schedule an appointment on the day of our choosing and within a window of time between 12PM-2PM. Jesus arrived right in time at 12. We'd had an issue with our washer leaking, but weren't sure what the exact problem was. Jesus was very communicative, explained the issue and the steps he would take to repair it, and gave us a prompt quote. Our washer was fixed within an hour. He was very respectful of our home, and even disinfected the area behind our washer where the water had leaked and it had become musty. We're very pleased with the professionalism and the quality of the work done.</text>

They don't clean up after themselves. Don't finish secondary jobs like refilling concrete they demolished. Did not tell me that they broke my inner basement door.
And did not clean up the tar they used to seal the pipes near my stairs.

So not so great on anything but the actual plumbing bits. They were polite and quick workers and had little real problems working. They have bad tendency to not contact you if they should do follow up work and when.

There managers and team leaders are good workers and easy to work with. They are cheap and have multiple payment options.</text>

I was impressed with the people that were sent to do the work I requested. They were very professional, courteous and respectful. They were mindful of cleanliness. Wore mask while inside the house all the time. And, made sure the area was cleaned before they left. Eric, who did the sewer pipe repair in the crawl space, showed me some pictures he took after the work, to explain the what and why. This gave me peace of mind that the work was done right.< /Review>

José was on time and real patient at figuring out the issues. He did the work estimate and quickly explained to me how the job will go.
He was quick and accurate and resolved the problem quickly and we had the drains in sink and tub cleaned in couple hours.

Highly recommend Elite Rooters.<//Review>

<text>We had a bad blockage due to an angry tenant pouring used cat litter down the drains. Backed up all the way from the main line in to 4 units. Our plumber could not fix. Pablo Diaz at Elite plumbing fixed it in under 2 hours and gave good advice for the future. Thank you Mr. Diaz<//text>< gmapID>

Odor noticed in the bathroom of our home. Matt came and conducted a free visual inspection before offering some possibilities of what may be the cause. I opted to have a camera inspection conducted in the hopes of finding something. The next day, Matt and Erick arrived and conducted a thorough camera inspection, providing updates, pictures and videos. After finding a missing section in our drain waste vent system, we opted to have that section replaced. Erick and another technician, Jose, worked efficiently and quickly to install the system and even drained another section free of charge. Overall my experience was very pleasant. No hassle, no-nonsense, and never felt deceived or pressured. Would recommend.</text>

<text>Elite Rooter arrived on time to diagnose a serious plumbing problem at our business. The two gentlemen that came were so helpful and understanding and they explained everything in detail. We are still waiting for the OK from the property owner to proceed with the major repairs that are needed. Elite Rooter was our 3rd estimate for the cost of this job. They beat the cost of our first two estimates. I highly recommend this company over all others.<//text></record>

Oscar arrived on time and tried his best to locate the clogged pipe. He was very professional and covered the floor to make sure nothing spill on floor. He started his job from outside but could not fix the problem. Then he came inside and figured it out that the problem was under the sink. He called his supervisor Matt to bring a camera to perform camera inspection. His supervisor Matt offered camera inspection free of cost and spent 30-45 minutes to evaluate the problem. They are very nice and friendly people. I would highly recommend them and this company to anyone. I am happy and satisfied with their service. All that costs me only $69 and the job done.</Review>

<Review>Josh came to unclog the tube drain. He gave me an estimate and went to work. It turned out to be somewhat more difficult to finally get the clog removed. He even bent the snake an had to go to his truck and repair it. He was careful to cover the work area. He had a mask and put on shoe covers to protect my carpets. All said and done the drain was fixed and I was charged the original estimated price. Very happy. Thanks Josh!</Review>< user>

< review>
Elite Rooter worked on our shower drain back in August. We were pleased with their work and professionalism. They cleaned up and left the area clean. They were on time and courteous. When my kitchen drain clogged up this past weekend I didn’t hesitate to use them again. They were in and out in 45 minutes, the drain is again working properly. I recommend their service highly.

This is another review on Elite Rooter. Geovany was friendly, courteous and professional. He left our kitchen perfectly clean when the job was done. This is our third time ( the joy of owning a old home) using Elite and I highly recommend their service.</review>

<review>Seems every time I have a clogged drain it is after 5pm on a Friday or the weekend. I’ve always had trouble getting same day service. I called Elite Rooter at 9am on a Saturday. They said they could be at my home by 10am. This time I had the time conflict and they worked around my schedule to meet me between 1-3pm. At 1:15 Geovany was there to save the day. Same day service, excellent service and they honored their Internet promotion. Great job Elite!!!</review>< Pictures>

The Plumber/Representative, Joshua Valencia,  unclogged our shower drain and went over and beyond by checking all my bathrooms and kitchen.He also gave us recommendations on how to avoid the re-occurrence  of these plumbing problems.  The best part is that he explained to me how best to resolve problems at least costs.  He also cleaned up the areas that he worked on. Impressive. Thank you Joshua and Elite Rooter.</Text>

<review>My son decided to flush a washcloth in his Grandmama toilet. 😬
The people were super friendly from the lady in the phone to the young man who came out. I called and they were here an hour and 15 minutes later on a Saturday! An hour and 15 minutes! They were super nice. Really friendly. He wore shoe covers, a mask and gloves. He was in and out in less than 10 minutes. I really appreciate being super responsive when you have a toddler running around, that makes a world of difference. I would highly recommend them!</review>< Pictures>

First off, I cant say enough positive things about Elite Rooter. Yesterday I noticed a warm spot on my kitchen floor. We immediately figured we had a broken pipe below our floor (pipes are cemented in the slab here).  I called my insurance and they said to call someone who is licensed asap, so I called Roto-Rooter and they said they would have the local rep call me within 25 minutes but they didn't so I called them back after 45 minutes.  They told me they couldn't get anyone out with a sensor until Monday.  I Googled and Elite-Rooter came up so I called them and they sent Matt and Carlos over to assess the issue.  They discovered that the pipe in the slab has broken and then showed me the water meter  outside was moving.  I called my insurance and they started to fight me and continue to, causing serious frustration.  Their crew put up with me arguing with my homeowners insurance.  Matt decided in the meantime to help me so I can have hot water and we can shower, they would install a valve exiting my water heater so I could shut off the hot water which is the pipe that is broken.  They then discovered the safety (cold) water shut off outside was stripped and needed to be completely removed which was not an easy project as it involved using a torch and configuration of one part into pvc and the other copper.  Matt then continued to work with the insurance (which is still being an issue) but called another one of their plumbers named Oscar to assist Robert with repairing and fixing the two valves which again turned out to be a project. They were able to install the valves so we can turn the hot one on and shower then turn it off  to stop the leak until the insurance decides what to do.  I then realized that the only positive thing that happened was these great three guys that came to my house.  They were kind, courteous and knowledgeable.  Both my wife and I had a good feeling with these guys. They put on shoe booties, wore masks and explained everything step by step. There was a time that they left to get the "right" parts as they said the connections of the existing pipes didn't leave them enough room so it would have to have an elbow, but they weren't comfortable with that.  We never had the feeling of having "strange people in our house as these guys felt like friends.  I will definitely call them again and hope to work with them throughout the next process of fixing the pipes.< /text>

<Review>Erick Zavala was the technician and he did fantastic work.  He was thorough in figuring out the problem before doing the actual work.  He tested a nearby toilet and bathtub to narrow down the location of the clog.  Then he quickly cleared the clog in a few minutes.  Afterwards, he went under the house to ensure that related problems weren't occurring and he found several major leaks due to faulty abs material.  He took pics and showed those to me.  Turns out the clog was a minor issue compared to the leaks.  As an aside, he dressed in clean company apparel and wore coverings over his shoes when he was inside the house.   He disposed of all material in his own trash bags and took it with him when he was done.  I would gladly give him the highest recommendation for doing a complete and thorough job, he's a professional.< /Review><date>1619805604061< /date><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<rate>5<//rate><text>My toilet was continuously leaking lots of water continuously flushing. Josh immediately came over and changed the flapper which was seriously gnarly and beyond its date of being changed however the toilet was still draining. Josh then did the next step and changed the fill valve and that worked well. He explained everything that’s why I even know names of the parts he changed. Gave me good tips to prevent toilet issue from happening again. He worked fast with no bs, did not waste my time. No bs fees that I did not agree with. He cleaned up after himself, huge plus. Definitely recommend Elite Rooter’s plumber Josh. Easy to work with, funny guy.<//text>< pictures>

Their ads says “If we cannot clear your drain we do not charge anything!!”  Not true.. they still charge me $179 without fixing the issue, and they said it’s my pipe’s problem and gave a 3.4K repair proposal even not including patch the concrete, if I accept that would cost me at least FOUR THOUSANDS DOLLAR! I was told this is the only option I have.

THE MOST DRAMA THING: they lied to me that my tenant is not able to use the water in house like shower, because of the clog. BUT the truth is only hallway half bathroom is clogged, not all bathrooms are clogged!! I think they were trying to give me pressure to accept their 3.4K repair plan! I MUST REPORT THIS TO THE STATE LICENSE DEPARTMENT! LIAR!

The reason they gave me why I am still charged because they went to the roof.. but I do have a clean out on ground..

I called another plumber and they fixed the clog by using the ground clean out and pulled the stuff causing clog.

I send the receipt and details to them for refund, no response.

Ok, dispute on my credit company and file my complain to the state license department, let’s wait and see.</Text>

i contacted Elite Rooter because my plumbing had backed up in both my toilets and both showers. Within a short amount of time they had a senior technician (Geovany Rebolledo) out to my home. He was very kind and professional and assured both my husband and I that he was there to help.
He explained his assessment and what he was doing each step of the way.
He was very efficient and totally resolved the problem quickly.
I would highly recommend this company to all !

Very courteous and explained everything well. Pricing was very competitive. Was able to schedule within 24 hours. Even spoke to my HOA to resolve the issue. Only issue was they didn't notify me when they were done (they were flushing out one of the main lines outside), so I had to call to find out and then call again when the office didn't call back with an answer. But otherwise really good service.</Text>

What a find! Those four other establishments I had called will never get another call from me, not as long as Geovany Rebolledo can show up at my door. Let's start with the phone answering process. Clear and prompt, the receptionist was able to commit to an appointment time. You'd think this would be a normal natural way for anyone to do business. It's not. None of the competitors could do that. Elite Rooter could and did.
I had a clogged toilet. It seemed to me that the clog involved only the toilet and not the lower reaches of the soil line. Geovany quickly tested and came to the same conclusion. No attempts at upselling. (!!!) After augering out the  clog, he was about to finish up when my wife mentioned that another of our commodes was also clogged. Oh, great! Off to the second toilet he went.  Well, maybe he'll give us a break on the additional charge. Not necessary! No extra charge. He wouldn't accept a credit card tip from me, but if I ever need their services, I want to have cash ready.<//text>

Excellent job in repairing outdoor drainage system.  Both men assigned to the task were extremely professional.  No surprises and cost was very competitive.  Definitely would request the two men to address future jobs.   Would highly recommend their services.<//Review>

Pablo was amazing. He talked through the whole process with me and gave recommendations based on his expertise. I definitely recommend Elite Rooter. I used another plumbing company in the past and Elite Rooter delivered the same service at a fraction of the cost. You are not only getting quality services with knowledgeable technicians, but also getting a fair and reasonable price for the services rendered. 10/10 would recommend.

I was not paid for my review. 100% of my content is based on the service I received.</text>

Recently my shower and toilet were clogged and I called my usual plumber.  It turned from $150 job to a potentially several thousand dollar job.

There was a bigger issue occurring that I was completing unaware.  Apparently the water / sewer pipes under neath the house, which are some 60 years old, were significantly leaking!

In the last few months I got a new roof, house painted and a termite treatment.  A lot of money at one time so when I heard I had to now replace some of my water pipes, I was not very happy.

But there is one thing I learned many years ago.  It is better to face the reality of the situation early and as completely as I can, otherwise it will be more costly down the road and many more headaches!

But my usual plumber never showed me any photos or video of the issue and what I was dealing with but just a general description of the issue and how much is would cost.  Before I decide to lay out that type of money, I want to fully understand what I am dealing with and will this truly resolve the issue or will this issue just keep demanding more money and time?

So I called several other plumbers to get a second opinion.  They all wanted to charge me $100 - $150 to inspect the issue so they could provide an estimate except one … Elite Rooter.

Without requesting it, they took a video of what was happening underneath my house and I was shocked at the level of damage and leakage that was occurring.

It was not even close to what my usual plumber told me!

But not Elite Rooter.  Giovanni and David told the whole picture and supported with a video and strongly recommend I replace all the water pipes underneath the house.   Based on the age of pipes, if not now, it would occur to the water & sewer pipes in the kitchen and laundry area.  They would be willing to deduct a proportion of the cost if I didn’t want them done but he did not recommend it.

They also had several financing plans, one being 18 months with no interest, which lessen the blow.

I always want to dealing with people / companies who are very competent, honest to a fault, thorough and thoughtful in how best to serve a customer’s challenges.  We have too many challenges as it is and too little time to address them.

This is why it is so valuable to have a painter, like Elite Rooter, to meet the challenges of being a home owner!

We are in day two of a three day project. Julio with Elite Rooter came out to snake the pipes (that only have access too on the roof). He was so nice, polite, wore a mask and cleaned up after his work, I was impressed on day 1. Unfortunately they found roots in the pipes and we don't have a clean out valve. So his boss came back with him later that day to run a camera down the drain. They come to the conclusion that we had to get a clean out valve put in to get the clogs out. So they came back the next day to install the clean out drain. There is still some work to be done, so they'll be back tomorrow. But so far, Julio, his boss and the guy that dug the huge hole to the pipes in our front yard, have been a pleasure to work with.<//text>

We had a leak coming from our toilet and Antonio figured out that the ring that seals the bottom needed to be replaced. He fixed it all and also found a crack in the toilet. He patched it up but let us know we’ll probably need to replace it soon. Happy we got the leak fixed for now!< /text>

Had what I thought was just a sink clog. I couldn't fix it so figured to call the pros. Scheduled an appointment and Elite had Matt senior tech come out. Just like everything else in my home there is always something else going on. Ended up needing to replace the drain pipe due to corrosion and age. Matt was very helpful in the process and was able to complete repair same day. Sink is draining better than ever. Thank you Matt and Elite Rooter for your service.</review>

We called Elite Rooter for a clog in our drain system.  They were able to come out the same day (very important since the drain was completely clogged and not draining at all).  The worker (Salvador) showed up on time, assessed the job, and then did it.  He even wanted to check to make sure we had no other drain problems (our pipes are old) before he left.  We were very impressed.  The price was very reasonable and the service was great.  Salvador was very professional, knowledgeable, and courteous.  We will definitely be calling on them again.</text>

< Review>
I have a pretty standard issue (clogged shower drain) - they showed up and weren't able to get the issue fixed or even diagnose the problem. they said they'd call their supervisor to get some back up but he refused to come. Following that, they wanted to break open a wall and charge me $1400 - on a hunch. I'm not sure why I paid any amount because I got zero value out of them coming.</Review>

Antonio was awesome, super knowledgeable and got my clogged toilet fixed asap. He also told me about potential future issues with the type of pipes we had so that was helpful. Covid ready! Antonio showed up with a mask and shoe coverings. Very friendly guy. Will use again in the future.</review>

I'm so happy we chose Elite Rooter to help with our plumbing problem. Even though we had no idea what to expect, I'm very satisfied with the outcome. Matt was very helpful and informative, and not at all condescending, which let's be honest happens. He and his supervisor explained our situation and gave us the best options, without pressure on which to choose. As well as completing the project in good time. My mom and I went out of town but my sister was there and said they were completely professional. I highly recommend this company.<//review>

Quick response time, almost immediate. Scheduled an appointment and arrived early in the time window. The gentleman was very professional and explained what he planned to do.  He ended up pulling out this huge plastic piece that was causing us this headache. Thank you, Elite Rooter for the quick response! You have our business for any future plumbing issues.</text>

They were prompt in coming out. I got multiple quotes because replacing the main line is such a large expense and their quote was very competitive and I opted to go with them because of the trenchless repair.
Overall very happy with the service.< /Review>

Sergio A. Of Elite was able to unclog our kitchen sink.
He did so professionally and cleaned the area after the repair.  I would use Elite again and ask for Sergio to who they send out.

Matt was by far the most professional detailed worker and went through everything with me step by step before he did everything to let us know exactly what he's changing and why he's changing it. I'd highly recommend Matt for every plumbing job that you need done in your home.</text>

He cleared our clogged drain and explained what caused it, which wasn’t what we thought!  He went under the house and showed us pictures of what we could do to support our very old plumbing.  We enjoyed working with Jorge and told him he would be the one we called when we choose to update our system.</Text>< Pics>

David H is simply amazing. The first time I called the company for a drain by the side of our house due to downstairs bathroom was clogged. Dave was able to find out the problem came from the main pipe out by the street and should have been fixed by our homeowner association. I've had to call for sneaking services every other year for the last ten years and he was the one who NAILED the root issue. Our HOA finally fixed the main drain and I expect my drain will be trouble free for the next many years.

I had to call David again this past week due to kitchen drain clog. He was nice enough to give me next day time estimate by phone messages. Both him and me got busy the next day so we both decided to move to the next day. I got in touch and he was citing a timeframe in the afternoon though he was beyond the end of the window by about half an hour. He agreed to start performing the work in my backyard before I was able to get back home. He appeared very professional and explained things in detail. The drain was cleared out in less than 30 minutes and he explained the hypo wash to not have to clog pipes frequently again.

The most amazing things is that he decided to do the work FOR FREE due to schedule difficulties. To be honest I did not expect that at all. He was keeping good communication throughout, therefore the rescheduling wasn't a big issue at all. I am impressed by the ethics of this company and Dave. Very rarely people do things for free just because they caused small inconvenience to their customers. This shows they truly value their customer experience and they are in for the long term relationship with their clients. I have respect for the business and will recommend them to anyone in my family and friend circle. Highly recommended!!<//Review>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>I had Elite Rooter replace broken water supply line from main to the house. David showed up promptly even though it was late in the evening and gave a very reasonable estimate, and we started the work very next day. David also kindly agreed to patch up driveway after the work, even though that was not necessarily part of the job. After a great work fixing the line, David spent time meticulously cleaning up minor dirt collection in small outlets in the bathroom that tends to happen after such a work. He then showed up the next day and worked through very carefully to fix the driveway. I knew this was not part of the plumbing job and thought David was just planning for a quick fix. He spent almost the entire day making sure that the driveway is fixed properly and the work looked like professional masonry work. I very much appreciated this work ethic and thoroughness - a true 5 star customer experience and work quality.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Matt Sanchez showed up at my door on time and prepared.  He was courteous, intelligent, forthright and a pleasure to talk with.  I was extremely happy with the price at which the service was performed and the manner in which Matt did the job.
I originally had called Elite more for a quote on a repair job than a route of the mainline. After discussing the video (previously taken), however, he made a good pitch for why we should route again, and the price was reasonable so I agreed.  We looked at the job afterwards, really more for the quotation of a trenchless replacement than anything else, and it was clear that the obstruction was gone.  I still need additional work, but this gives me a little more breathing room.
I was impressed by Elite and I have already recommended them to another homeowner I know.  Their professionalism on my small job is a great segue into fostering a strong belief that they can handle larger jobs just as well.</review>

Excellent Service all Around
Everything about my experience with Elite Rooter was fantastic and easy.  I received a call not long after submitting my service request.  They were able to send someone out within a few hours.  The woman who scheduled my appointment was friendly and helpful.  The technician, David, was awesome and very thorough.  He called to let me know his timing and sent a follow up text when he was closer.  David was very professional.  he took the time to cover his work boots each time he came in the house.  He was very clear communicating and otherwise helpful explaining everything.  I would highly recommend their services if you are in need.< /review>

<text>The service was in time and on time. Made a request 8 pm the night before, and show up right at the beginning of the time window with professional staff.

Very reasonable price, experienced staff, and handled the customer experience very well. The technician Marcus was very well organized and experienced on how to deal with issues.

I am extremely pleased on this experience and I will defiantly give the thumbs up for Elite Rooter and Marcus.< /text>< Pictures>

I called Elite Rooter and had Geo Rebolledo over checking out the bathroom sink in an hour. He promptly diagnosed the issue, explained the options and pricing, and made the necessary fixes. I appreciated the professionalism and courtesy - he wore a mask and shoe coverings the entire time.< /Text>

The technician is very professional and does good quality job. They also provide a 30 days warranty for the rooter service. There is once my laundry drain was clogged within the warranty again and they are very happy to redo the service for me.<//Review>

<Text>I am one not leave reviews, but my call to Elite Rooter was such a refreshingly great experience that I had to leave one!

From the moment that I called Elite Rooter to the actual repairs to
my clogged bathroom drain I could not have been more pleased with the professionalism and expertise !

Senior Tech / Marcus Pecina accessed my drainage issues at such a professional level that my anxiety levels were put to ease immediately.

I can not say enough on the quality and extra effort that Marcus made me feel!

If you want clean trust worthy work you can count on.....

They arrived within 2 hours of my call, Jorge  assessed the problem and then Gabe, the Field Manager, arrived and reviewed Jorge’s work and gave me multiple options to solve the problem. The backup was temporarily resolved that evening so my tenants  were able to stay in the house. The next day the sewer lateral was replaced and the tenants had full use of the plumbing by the late afternoon. We were pleased with their work and their follow up when the City failed to show for the final inspection. It was expensive but not totally shocking that the 62 year old lateral failed!

I had a clogged sink and Matt S. came out for the service call. He was very professional and showed up on time. He gave me a price up front after the initial inspection. I agreed to the service. It was a nice touch that he put on plastic booties over his work boots. He also put down some plastic in the bathroom before starting to snake the sink. He was able to unclog the sink with no problem. He noticed that I had a small leak in my sink trap and repaired it at no additional cost. It’s easy to see that these guys take pride in there work.< /Review>

<review>We had been dealing with a terrible clog in the kitchen sink. Tried everything from baking soda and vinegar to purchasing our own snake tool. Called Elite Rooter and spoke to Liz. She listened to our concerns and said she could have someone out within the next hour or two. Received a call 10 min before the actual timeframe from Martin, letting us know he'd be at our home in the next 10 to 15 min. Martin sadly struggled because the clog was super bad, but he handled it like a pro! Extremely professional and friendly. I hope there is not a next time for us, but I'll be keeping Elite Rooter in mind for future needs for me or to refer. Thank you guys!!!</review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

I had never used Elite Rooter, but I decided to try them for a same day service appointment. From the moment of the call with Liz, my concerns were alleviated. She was professional and very well spoken. She scheduled my service technician to arrive in a 2-hour window, which Eddie did. He was courteous, and solved our plumbing problem quickly  Thank you, Elite Rooter!<//Text>

I had a clogged drain that caused water to backup when the washing machine was running. I called Elite Rooter and made an appointment. I got a call from Matt about 15 minutes before he arrived. Matt was courteous, patient and had pleasant attitude through out our interaction. He took time to snake the drain in the garage and stop several times to make sure the clog was cleared. He even put down a plastic sheet in the work area to catch any dirt and water overflow.</Review>

Edgar was very professional and polite he got to work right away. He covered my wooded floors to make sure nothing got messy. It was a very quick process and he explained everything he did as he went on to get our drain back and running. Overall a great experience and I highly recommend Elite Rooter and make sure to ask for Edgar !!<//Review>< pictures>

<review>Unbelievable! Eddie and Gab were very professional and conscientious about how they completed the clean out and video of my main sewer line. Top of the line equipment too. They also were very informative explaining what they were doing and in recommendations. All for a very modest price. I definitely can recommend EliteRooter based on this first encounter with them.
Thank you!</review>< Pics>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>This review is mainly in response to how their main contact Gabe treated us.
We used them for replacing our sewer. Their tech (George) was courteous but after they finished I got a call saying they would like the payment right away. I said I am happy to make the payment as soon as the final city inspection (due after a business day) is completed. At this point Gabe became extremely threatening. He said the city inspection was not their concern nor responsibility and that he would come to my place monday morning to make sure I pay.
I've done business with 3x the amount of this invoice with other contractors but this kind of threatening behavior was unprecedented. Finally after city inspection I called them on my own and paid but have decided never to do business with them again.< /Review>< Pics>

<text>Sal came out to my house after my kitchen sink was plugged, badly. He came, was very professional even put booties on his boots. He was nice, quickly assessed the issue and knew what was needed to fix it. He did his job quickly and even gave a recommendation to replace something under my sink. Nice, quick and knowledgeable. Definitely would recommend and use this company again.</text>< Response>

< review>
I called about a laundry drain clog that was causing a flood in my laundry room. Martin was quick to diagnose the problem and suggest a fix. When the cost seemed too steep, he haggled it down as much as he could before suggesting a different method that was half the price. The solution may not be permanent but he put a personal guarantee on it that he would come back and fix it himself for the difference in the two prices should it be clogged again.

On his way out he also pointed out a very badly calcified pipe leading to my water heater. Apparently it could burst any time leading to massive water damage. I am working on getting a quote from him to fix this now. He may have saved me a lot more hassle.

Very professional and courteous service. I would use them again in a heartbeat.< /review>

Called in for a quote and the gentleman that picked up was very informed, he answered all my questions then sent one of their technicians to my house within said time frame. Salvador, the technician, kept in contact with me the whole time before showing up so that I was informed of his arrival. He was friendly and solved my drain problem in no time. I loved their service and everyone was very professional. I definitely recommend Salvador! He's the man!</Text>

Analyzed issue and attempted simple rotorooting. Did not work. Went out of his way to find blockage. Had to crawl under house. In middle of repair found simpler solution that actually will last longer and potentially solve future potential issues. Better overall repair—same agreed upon price. Spend 8 hrs in total from start to finish (includes going for unexpectedly needed supplies). Cheerfully took time to explain everything being done and why. Even put up with me!< /Review>< Pics>

Our pipes backed up in half of our house. Kitchen and family room bath out of use. I called Elite and within the hour they were here! It was more than a Roter rooter quick snake due to years of sediment, but with a high pressure water clean out to the main we are flowing once again. The crew was efficient, polite to each other during the job (please and thank you’s to each other) and texted me as to arrivals and status while out getting machinery and parts.
They were the best company we have dealt with professionally, equipped with the tools and machinery and versed on etiquette. Make them your first call when in need!< /text>

I had a problem with my drain in my bathroom and Elite Rooter came in within their appointment window.   Marcus did a quick diagnosis and quickly resolved the issue.  In addition to fixing my drain, he took a quick scan of my crawl space and highlighted potential issues that will need to be addressed in the future.  Jesus came by and offered an estimate of the total repair cost, so that we can plan for it.  Both Marcus and Jesus were very courteous and were not pushy at all.  I highly recommend their services as it was fast and thorough.</text>

<Review>Quick to schedule, plumber also arrived on schedule. Plumber Sal discovered the issue, explained the fix procedure, asked us to sign the agreement before he started. Demonstrated experience while meticulously fixing the issue. Setup, cleanliness and wrapping up are commendable.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>Messaged Elite Rooter on yelp to get an estimate. Ashlea replied to me with a more information as what I could do in regards to my toilet repair issue. We scheduled to have Eddit come out to take a look and provide an estimate. The initial consultation and review would not cost anything, and the estimate will not expire.
Eddie and co. came to review the tank, determined the issue and provided me an estimate. Currently reviewing everything before finalizing. But they have been very communicative and on point. Super professional as well.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<Review>Called these guys to check for a leak in the kitchen sink.Turns out there was no leak, just a loose connection. So they did not charge me anything. Wow! So thankful to them. Marcus Pecina was so polite and very professional. Will use these guys next time for sure.

We had our entire home system redone.  Carlos and Fernando worked tirelessly to complete our job quickly.  They were very respectful of our home.  Giovanni worked with us to explain the entire job and ensure the work was completed.  I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND Elite Rooter for others to use.<//Review>

Isaac came out and was absolutely amazing and extremely helpful, not only fixing my problem, but going under my house to investigate a possible leak at no extra charge. He also informed me of a potential fire hazard I had, and gave me a no pressure solution on how to proceed to fix the problem. I will be using him for all my plumbing needs from now on!< /Review>

Best service in town.
Our toilet was clogged and I went to yelp to look for the solution.
I read Elite Rooters reviews and was compelled to call them.
Best decision.
Marcus cane on time, and was extremely professional. I could tell from the way he handled the situation and issue,  that he had done it a million times.
I would highly recommend Elite Rooter to anyone, anyday.< /review>

I had a couple of drain issues in my guest and family bathroom. Googled and found Elite rooter which had a great discount and rating. They were over within a couple of hours. Edgar Mata did the job efficiently and gave a lot of good advice along the way. Overall, exactly what I would want when I am in a plumbing crisis. Thanks Elite plumbing and Edgar.< /Review>

<text>I had a main waterline issue that a previous plumber.  I called that plumber to come back and assess and resolve the issue but left and never returned to fix/resolve the issue (former plumbing service left my home...said they were coming back with the parts needed to fix the issue, and never came back).

I called Elite Rooter, and they stepped in quickly.  Elite Rooter  provided me with my service arrival time and arrived within that service window on-time.

Elite Rooter confidently and professionally assessed and resolved my issue. Although my plumbing issue seemed simple, it wasn't.  As they began working, problems arose one after the other.  But Geovany (Elite Rooter Plumbing Technician) was not deterred.  He restored water to my house after 1 full day and a half.  Geovany even explained what happened  and provided me with a solution to prevent the issues I was experiencing before the fix from ever happening again in the future.

If I could give Elite Rooter 6 stars, I would.  I am thankful I called the right plumbing professional to help me.  I HIGHLY recommend Elite Rooter.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1564594817291, 'text': 'Thank you for leaving us a 5 star review!

<Text>My kitchen sick was blocked and I was googling “plumber” when I saw their Ad. I didn’t believe they were really that inexpensive but I decided to give them a call.  They were they really only the price they advertised and they came out within 2 hours of my call. They gave me all my options and then fixed it and cleaned up. The best experience I have ever had with a plumber! The absolute best. I will only use them from here on out.<//Text>< pictures>

I called at 4 and was told the technician would be at my  house between 5 and 6. He showed up at 5 sharp and got to work and had the line cleared in 20 - 30 minutes. He was very professional and courteous. The price quoted was exactly what I paid. I will definitely use Elite again.<//Text>

Our main sewer line backed up and I called Elite rooter.  They quoted me $69 for the drain clean out.   Albert called and ended up coming out about more than 1 hour earlier than estimated and performed the drain clean out and got the water flowing.  Great customer service.  The amount charged was $69.  No bait and switch, trying to up sell us.  Great work.  I am very happy with Elite Rooter and Albert.  Highly Recommended!<//Text>

Salvador came on time by schedule. He is very professional, resolved the clogging in the kitchen and showed me the oily greasy pipe. I give Salvador 4 stars. But I am disappointed is with the $200 charge and compared with other rooter service I hired several years ago with similar charge, Elite does not include the pipeline image service.< /text>

My experience with Elite Rooter was so amazing. We reached out to have them provide a quote for unclogging our bathroom sink. Their quote was very competitive, much cheaper than any of the other companies. They offered a same day appointment and were extremely flexible when our plans changed. Edgar gave us a call when he was on his way and was polite and friendly when he arrived, even wearing booties to not scratch our wood floors! He fixed our sink in less than 20 minutes, took photos for our reference, and talked us through future maintenance. I would definitely used this company again for any of our plumbing needs.<//review>

I called for an unclogging and clearing service (special price $79). The plumbers were quick to diagnose the root of the problem and were very transparent about the potential effects It would have. The clog was cleared fast and we have a better sense of what we need to do moving forward.</Text>

I called Elite Rooter expecting a relatively simple main drain line clog that could be fixed in an afternoon, but discovered that our problem was much larger - ultimately taking nearly a week to fully diagnose and repair. David, Joe and the crew were consistently great to work with, and very accommodating of our needs throughout.< /text>

<Time>1551639552232</Time><Rating>3< /Rating><Review>I would recommend this company but would also tell a customer to get multiple quotes for comparison.

Luis and Gio were very professional and did a great job for the repairs and replacement work.  Their work was really great and they were very knowledgable on how to replace in wall plumbing with the least amount of wall removal.   I would give these plumbers that did the work 5 stars.

I would give the company one star for cost information, detailed quoting

So averaged the stars for a 3 star rating.

I called elite rooter about a Toilet drain that was clogged and a kitchen sink drain that was flooding my basement when water was used.   They showed up within 2 hours assessed the issue and gave me a quote, the cost was in the thousands. details in the quotes was very limited as they did not give costs details on any material/labor just one large cost for a basic description of work.  I asked for a more detailed breakdown which they said I would get but did not.    The cost was extremely high but I believed they were giving me a good price. . I went with them and mistakenly did not get any other quotes.  After the repairs were completed I did get quotes from 2 other companies and they both were approximately 30% less than Elite.  I was highly disappointed that I failed the rule of getting more than one estimate.</Review>< pics>

We called Elite Rooter of SJ. The call was prompt and professional. They sent someone within 2 hours!

Carlos called upon arrival to let us know he was outside our garage. We had him come up, showed him the issue and told him what we were told should be done. Before taking apart anything, he decided to check the garage for a clean out. He found one, and he texted it. The drain blockage was not there, so he troubleshooted some more, and he found the best method to clear our issue. He was hard at work, and my husband felt for him, so he helped him dump water and clear the buckets, etc.

In the end, he fixed our issue, and he said if we have any issues to call him directly. Super nice guy and really prompt and professional. I like that he tried to find alternative routes that were less invasive first.

I've saved their # in my contacts for any future plumbing issues.< /review>

Polite plumbers with good communication. They were able to quickly diagnose the issue but then they were unable to clear the drain with the snake because the snake was getting stuck. They wanted to replace pipes. Called another plumber and they cleared it in 10 minutes for about same price.<//Review>

<text>So far so good . . . gotta wait til the project is done and we r not there yet. Then we can give u a full blown review! One thing I can say is that Luis Perez is the best! Anyone needing plumbing services u ask 4 Luis he is totally awesome! You’ll be stopping up your toilets with little kids shoes to have him come back! Yes he is that good! Very charismatic, super honest, very clean, never leaves u w/o service and best of all goes way beyond your expectations of a plumbing company employee. In fact I know “that was not included in the bid” and also “this was not included in the bid”. He just so super nice . . . like he is working for family! We’ll see how this project ends! We’ll just see how elite “Elite” is.<//text>< rate>

So we could not take shower in our master bathroom. The plumber the previous owner hired came with some part and was not able to fix the issue. We were very frustrated with the whole situation. Found elite rooter from google and they were able scheduled an appointment same day. Brian Sabeedta showed up around 8 pm looked at our shower and after some troubleshooting he was able to completely fix the shower and the valve which also fixed a hot/cold water mixing issue!! We were totally impressed with Brian and his friendliness and willingness to look at the issue and fixing it even when it was getting late. Very professional and helpful! We are very happy with elite rooter and will definitely call them again! Thanks a lot Brian!</text>< user_id>

The price the representative told me when making the appointment was $69 (I provided a complete and accurate description of the work that needed to be done, and no further work was done). The total bill came out to $590 (and this is after a 10% discount).

In their defense, they did tell me the price before proceeding with the work, and I agreed, because it needed to be done, but I would not use them again on grounds of their less-than-honest pricing practices.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Elite Rooter was on time, professional and cleared a stopped up laundry tub. They went overboard to see if there were any other plumbing issues and did not charge extra. Their rate was more than reasonable and I will call them again for plumbing problems.< /review>

Brain was professional, clean and knew his job. Went out of his way to explain and give recommendations on the fix.
Bad time management by dispatch. Didn’t bother to inform me of delays. My appointment was between 1-3pm. I had to call several times after 3.00 pm to get updates and the plumber arrived around 4.30pm. Would be nice to keep clients posted on delays and arrival times.< /review>

<review>I gave Elite a call early in the morning and the had a plumber out to my house in no time! I requested a 100 ft snake service from multiple rooter companies and none of them had it, only 75 ft. I called Elite which they guaranteed a 100 ft. snake and we got exactly what I was looking for. The job was completed in no time! I highly recommend Elite Rooter to everyone in the Bay Area.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Elite Rooter rocked for us: on time, on budget, clean and the sink drains now. I will definitely use them next time.<//review>
</record></dataset><record>
< text>
Ours was a multi-day fix and install of 2 cleanouts (one front of house, and one in back.) After several attempted maintenance trips over 3yrs, the roots were taking over so badly that it was causing damage to the old clay piping. After 2 failed snake attempts and then a camera run, the Elite guys found sitting water in a damaged area, and pinpointed the exact location to dig. Carlos from Elite was extremely kind and professional, and worked over the Thanksgiving holiday, in the rain, by himself. He took special care to make sure the area was clean and secure before leaving. I appreciated the communication from him each day about what work was remaining. If you’re reading this, I’m sure you can relate to the terribly unpleasant and aggravating experience of seeing raw sewage rising up in your shower, while the laundry washer drains during the spin cycle. Anyhow, in the spirit of the holiday season, our landlord was gracious enough to handle almost the entire experience, so I can’t speak to the initial call and dealings afterwards. However, I can say Carlos showed up each day, and got the job done. The relief of knowing the line is fixed and clear is a true blessing for the holidays. Thank you Elite and thank you Carlos.</text>

I had an additional problem with a leak outside our home that both Alex and Giovanni helped me with.

Alex was the best.   You know that little feeling of dread when you have to call a plumber? Don't worry, just call Elite Rooter of San Jose. Honest and reliable.  I found their coupon , for $69 drain unclogging special.  Alex arrived on time and very professional.  One of the best parts is I paid only $69 just like the coupon said.  Alex fixed my problem!,  The lines are not backing up anymore.  Elite Rooter of San Jose  even gives a 30 day guarantee!<//text>

Carlos was on time, super courtous, and used new technology equipment - quiet, smooth, easy to apply, to quickly unclog our drain, for fraction of the price any other similar service.

As a bonus, he inspected the pipes with cool camera that displayed the problem area, roots growing past the seams, and offered to sort it permanently out by replacing the older pipe for beyond resonable price.

Problem solved for good, rather then continue to plug unexpectedly.

Thank you
Great value and fantastic service< /text>

I highly recommend Elite Roter. I was able to get a same day appointment. We found out the blockage, which started in my kitchen sink, was actually in the main line and 100 feet away from my sink. They gave me a flat rate quote to clear it and they were at my house for four hours. They didn’t leave until it was done. Carlos was awesome and he cleaned up afterwards, which was really appreciated. Five stars!< /Review>

Great guy that came and did work, but I didnt like the bait and switch pricing policy. I called them out on a $69 special deal to unblock sink. But when they came my piping didnt allow that special price so the charge was the standard $205. It still only took them less than 30 minutes to complete job. I should have declined when a heard the 205. $100 or $120 would have been OK in my mind but switching from 69 to 205 when the job took less than 30 minutes seems unreasonable to me.

Liked the service, but couldnt recommend them and wouldnt use them again due to bait and switch pricing.</Review>

< Review>
Got an appointment same day that I called. Technician showed up right on time. He was professional, wore booties inside the house to prevent tracking anything in. Quickly fixed my clogged sink after providing a complimentary estimate. I’m talking 30 minutes for the entire visit. Everything was left just as it was prior to his arrival, with a now working drain. I would use them again and recommend to a friend.
*He also fixed the loose handle on my toilet, no charge.
Thank you for your service today!</Review>

My kitchen sink was clogged pretty bad. I called Elite Rooter at 8:30 am and they had a Technician at my house within the hour. Antonio arrived  and promptly unclogged my drain. He was very nice and extremely professional.  His work was very neat. I HIGHLY recommend this company. I am definitely saving their phone number incase I ever need a plumber in the future.</text>
