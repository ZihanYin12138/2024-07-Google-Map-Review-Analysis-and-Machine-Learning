Ordered on grubhub. Delivery person never showed up. Pretty sure this was an employee of theirs. I'd love to be able to comment on their food but instead I'm left an hour later and hungry. I'd give 0 stars if possible.<//Text>

<Review>The food took forever to come out. It was about a 2 hr dinner because the veggies came out, then the raw meat and then the broth, which was not hot. Seemed so backwards. Oh and everything that came out was in about five min gaps. Still, the food was great!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

<Text>I didn't get around to writing this review until now eight months later, but here we go.

Our group of six people for a birthday dinner came into the restaurant and there was only one other small party so it was rather empty and slow. The service was good at first with a friendly male server for the first 15 minutes, but then he kind of just disappeared for the rest of our meal. I had to flag down other employees who were walking past our table multiple times to get napkins, water, and basic table service.

I don't write too many negative reviews, but this experience even now, almost a year later, still stands out in my mind. Management at this restaurant needs to better train their employees.

The food portions we received were rather very small, and the pricing was on the higher end. We definitely didn't get a great amount of food for how much we paid, which was about $25 per person for the hot pot special and it's not even bottomless! I ordered a vegetarian dish and I only got what I recall as four small/medium pieces of tofu in it.

We definitely won't be coming back again. Disappointed!<//Text>< Rate>

Delicious food and awesome owner! Besides the great food they have, the owner always takes care of us. We always order their beef and salmon teriyaki combo. The sukiyaki soup base is the best with the beef and vegetables. We dine here at least twice a week. Great food, great service, great ambience.< /Text>

My family & I have been coming to this place for years now. Eddie the manager is wonderful, helpful, and makes sure you're accommodated. This place does tend to get busy during certain days & times, so I usually call ahead to ask wait time. Services can be a bit lagging during very busy times so go on a day not too busy.Their food is great. Their single portion shabu is enough for two people but we also get their 2 for special. Angus beef. Corn Miso and sukiyaki. Dipping Sauces are good with the cooked meats & rice with the broth. Other side sides were good too. Appetizer calamari were a great size. Not tiny. Decent quality and thick. Haven't had anything that has disappointed us. Place is clean. Will upload photos next time.< /Text>

<Review>I so wanted to give this place 5 stars. The atmosphere is chill. The lunch special is amazing. Lost of food for a great price. The assorted roll was what scared me. I've attached a photo. I've had bad sushi before and this was a sign that I could not ignore. At any rate I hope this post give management a better idea of their product. I will be back.< /Review>< name>

< review>
DO NOT EAT HERE.  THE MANAGER OF THIS RESTAURANT DOES NOT SHOW UP TO HIS JOB AND LETS FRESHLY HIRED WORKERS RUN AMOK.  I went to dinner the other day to only to be treated in the most horrendous manner.  My order took FOREVER to arrive to my table despite the restaurant being completely empty, and the explanation from my waitress was "oh, well we have alot of phone orders."  I let that slide.  Finally, we got our main course but never got our appetizer, despite having reminded our waitress numerous times.  We completed our meal, and instead of getting our dessert, the waitresa gave us our check.  We reminded her of the dessert, be we never got that either.  Finally, exasperated, i asked to have the items we never got to be removed from our bill, but our waitress informed us she couldnt because the manager was not in.  And why was the waitress a complete train wreck?  Because she just started working there!  So this so-called manager left this newbie employee along with another newbie employee completely unsupervised to run the restaurant!!!!   Unbelievable.  If the manager cant even show up for work and cant properly train employees, i can only imagine how this restaurant accomplishes more difficult tasks like keeping things up to code, assures that food is being handles appropriately, etc.  For your own safety, please avoid this place.  It is only a matter of time before this managers irresponsible behavior results in disasterous consequences.< /review>

<Review>Way, way overpriced and inexperienced sushi chefs. The Maki are mediocre and lacking any skill or creativity. The Uramaki fall apart easily. Tables are very close together as people consistently bump into others’ tables whenever they moving about. One waiter for the whole restaurant and front counter. The spoons are huge relative to the bowls.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The shabu shabu quality is fantastic and it's made even better by their wide variety of soup bases, meats, and other ingradients.

Moreover, you can customize the sauces to your liking. You can come to this place so many times and try something different each time. Try the beef, it's a classic flavor.

Outside of their soups, the other food is good. If you have space at the end of your meal get the green tea ice cream, and yes, get it fried.

Service is always fast and friendly.

sometimes you'll find a Yelp check-in deal.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

This is definitely one of the best sushi joints around chino hills.  The prices are fair and the service is great.  Everything is speedy and delicious.  This place is definitely one of the best.< /Text>

Good service. The ramen was okay...not spectacular. Very thin pork slices, too much noodles, and I was surprised about the corn kernels. The broth was okay.</Text>

Happy Hour prices are reasonable for both drink and food.  Nigiru sushi was excellent, wish they gave you a bit more sliced ginger with the order, but asking for extra was no problem.  The fish portions were large and high quality.  Would have preferred a bit  more sushi rice portion, but it's better this way than big rice/small fish!  My friend got the rolls and said they were great.  Saw others with Shabu Shabu and it looked fantastic with large portions.  Waiter said the lunch special is the hook up for the Shabu.<//Text>

We are very pleased to have found Myrtle Avenue Pet Center.  Moving here just at the outset of the pandemic lockdown, we needed to find pet supplies, a vet and you can imagine our standard poodle and soft coated wheaten terrier got quite scruffy.  We found all three at Myrtle Avenue Pet Center.  Both supplies and vet have been great but the groomers have really wowed us!  They took the notes of our previous groomer and a couple of photos and made the dogs look amazing. Both beasts are strutting around like princes now. Receptionist (gentleman) during most of the day, is great with taking payments in the time of COVID, bringing out the dogs and just being enormously friendly.  The young lady who checks in the dogs at 7:30am is either not a morning person or was just having a very bad day.  Interaction with her is short-lived and that’s a good thing.  By and large, the vast majority of the experience was fantastic and most importantly, our dogs returned home happy, healthy, well and looking beautiful!<//text>

<Review>Great for overnight boarding. These guys are wonderful with my 2 hyper girls. They have daily report cards and extra walks and massages for reasonable prices. This place has saved our butts when dealing with weddings and funerals out of state. I would give 6 stars is I could. The staff loves my dogs!<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Great little shop! Lots of selection for cats and dogs. The shopkeeper was very friendly and helpful. I loved visiting with the two golden retrievers behind the counter! My only complaint is the small selection of exotic animal supplies. However, I did find some of what I needed for my turtle at a reasonable price. Overall a great store, but don't come looking for anything other than cat and dog supplies.< /Review>

<review>No thanks. Ive seen, and heard multiple things that are negative, especially with grooming. Some staff are nice, others not so much. Also having customers in there using the self serve bath, which is also the same tub that is literally within 10 feet of the employed groomer in there. Thats a dangerous risk, having unknown dogs around customers dogs. Sorry but anything can go wrong. Self serve shouldn't be offered in that salon. Selection is ok. Rather go online or to another pet store.</review><date>1565158056127</date>< Pics>

<Response>None<//Response><review>I reluctantly left my pet here after they walked me back to where my pet would be kept. Upon seeing the uncleanliness I was horrified.  Unfortunately,  I was on a time constraint, and obviously did not have someone else available to watch my pet.  The caged area smelled like urine and it was dirty.  Very dirty.  When returned to pick up my pet 2 weeks later, I had requested that he receive a bath prior to my pickup and extra attention while I was gone.  I doubt he was given attention, but had hoped they would take special care of him since we paid the extra amount.   He also was not bathed.  I was told he was too nasty.  My pet is the most mellow animal, he's never bit anyone.  He was so upset and unhappy at this facility he defecated on his toys and blanket.  His toys and blanket were returned to me unwashed when I picked him up 2 weeks later. They didn't even bother to wash off the feces.  When I picked my pet up he was filthy, he smelled like excrement and he clung to me for dear life.  I doubt they every let him out of the 2x2 cage.  It was pathetic.  I feel horrible.  This place is bad news.  Don't leave your animals here.< /review><GmapID>0x54d3ffb3d4979371:0x529052e286212d53</GmapID>< Rate>

<review>Today was the first time I had visited this store.  I stopped to get my dog a Christmas toy.  I noticed the store was very unclean,  urine on the trash cans just sitting there.   When i needed help the store person was buying leashes from a dealer, so they couldn't assist me. What happened to customer service? I was rather upset.  I will not be going back.</review>< pictures>

<review>Very clean facility. A couple highs and lows though. My small dog (Dachshund) boards here when I'm not able to find a sitter and he is happy to come every day.  However, my large dog (Border collie, Great Pyrenees) absolutely HATES it here. I seriously believe that he was treated poorly when he was a puppy here because to this day, he cries as soon as we walk in the door and will not let the groomers touch him. Their grooming services they offer are great for my small dog. I believe that staff definitely has their favorite dogs and that is totally fine but the ones that don't immediately cooperate should not be drug to the next location such as bathing. 2 years ago I had put up a 5 star review and I am sad to  learn the things I have about the treatment of my large dog.

The older lady Nancy has cold incompasionate hands when she grooms your animal. I stayed to see how they treat the animals instead of their normal drop off the first time i took my puppy there and she gave me dirty looks the entire time. I dont know if they only have regulars or long time locals but literally nothing was explained to me, i didnt even know there were different grooming options until i had picked her up and got a grooming report card. I wouldnt bring your puppies here.</Review>

< review>
Don't bother paying for any of the "TLC" because they won't bathe your animal or clip the nails. Staff seems nice but they write little notes in the computer disrespecting customers. "Was rude on phone, very confrontational, Lied about x" all I asked was why after days of boarding, services I paid for were not completed until the minute I was picking my animal up.

Avoid if you can.<//review>

<review>I’m from San Diego and I loved this tour. It was so fun to sail on the water and see the sights. Captain John was professional and informative. He kept us safe and entertained as we sail around the bay. The spots and photo ops were perfect and we have lots to look back on from this amazing tour. We will be doing this again soon.

I planned this for my boyfriend's birthday and it was an amazing adventure. The boat is simple to drive and the instructor/tour guide will go over everything u need to know. It was the best way to spend our day and see the Harbor in a different way. Our tour guide was very friendly and professional. Bring some cash for tip later to show them you appreciate them.
This was a great thing to do during Covid since we were in our own boat and kept a distance from other groups.< /Review>

It was great to get out on the water and visit the points of interest with a knowledgeable guide. I was worried that this would feel like a nose-to-tail horseback trail ride. NOT-AT-ALL. So you follow in the wake of the guide. It makes no difference except to give you the confidence that you are going in the right direction. Then, when you hit a point of interest, BAM...you get all the info you need. Reminds me of a cycle tour of other cities. Very informative and out there, active participation. Totally exceeded expectations.< /text>

Booked the boat tour a few days in advance, got a call the next day they overbooked the tour and that they wanted to reschedule me. I told them I was only able to go that time since I was in town for a wedding and asked if they could ask someone else if they could reschedule. They said no then we are going to cancel. No apology, didn't seem to be bothered by it at all, it almost seemed like it happens all the time based on how non-chalant the person was on the phone. I was super excited to go and disappointed they couldn't accommodate me after already charging me for the experience.<//review>

My experience with the manager was absolutely terrible. I’m sure the speedboat tour would’ve been amazing but the people were not. I was accused of stealing a speedboat. Argued with over the phone about a refund and told that my group was under the influence when we had not even seen the manager face to face. After disrespecting me for 30 minutes over the phone he realized he was wrong and needed to give me a refund after I presented all of the information I needed to prove my group needed a refund.
I would not have someone like him running my company.< /review>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>Captain Scott was incredible! Really fun, funny, and knowledgeable. He was knowledgeable about the area but the water as well. Being a boater, I was a little worried about inexperienced people being on the water but Captain Scott did a great job educating everyone on the basics of water safety and was clearly watching out on the water for other people and picking the safest areas and times to go FAST and actually have a blast!! He was the perfect “Papa Duck”.

As for the tour itself, we went to several different places, got to see the USS Midway up close and personal, got to see dozens of sea lions, and our course got to drive our own personal little speed boat!!! I don’t remember if there’s options but I wouldn’t do anything less than a 2 hour tour (if it’s an option). You don’t get too wet but you are on the water, so bathing suit and appropriate over clothes and sun screen would be perfect. I wouldn’t bring anything big, there’s not a lot of room for big bags and definitely not small items that aren’t on your body (if you want to keep them in the boat). I brought my keys, a water bottle, and my phone/wallet (which second person in the boat held onto). Totally worth the money, can’t wait to go again soon!!!

Two hour tour (about 90 mins on the water) and you are in total control. Think of it like horseback riding on speedboats.

On the tour you get to open it up full throttle and chop through the waves, passing Navy Vessels and the San Diego skyline. Highlights, besides the speed, was passing the USS Lincoln aircraft carrier, seeing live sea lions play in your boat wake, driving right next to and under the USS Midway, and our guide Scott.

We were lucky enough to have the tour all to ourselves at 11:00am on a Monday and Scott was awesome and personal. He made us feel comfortable and capable and driving the speedboats is easy no matter your experience level. Amazing day on the water and money completely well spent!

Tips: 1. You do NOT get wet so don’t worry about that, dress for weather. 2. Bring cash for a tip (Scott deserves it in these times) 3. Sunscreen on hot days there is no shade unless you count the Midway!< /text>< GmapID>

Such a fun outing! You tour in your own small  boat follow-the-leader style. It was a great time on the water and our boat leader was knowledgeable and friendly. TIP: Be sure to arrive early so you don't hold up your group start time.<//Text>

It was a lot of fun. I got the 2 person boat for my son and I.  I got to drive for half and then we switched and he drove the other half. He had a blast. I will be booking another trip soon for my wife and I. If your in San Diego definitely check it out.< /Text>

I absolutely loved the tour. You get a quick tutorial at the beginning. I love that you control the boat yourself and it’s easy and fast. Gives a great view of San Diego and some fun facts.< /text>

Despite the initial hilarity of watching the guide, Geronimo, save one of our party from being stuck in a perpetual doughnut turn in their boat, the time on the water was amazing.  It was great to be able to see all those sites from the ocean and the enjoyment of steering your own speed boat back and forth on the water was thrilling.  Overall it was worth every penny and I would not hesitate to recommend it to anyone interested.<//Text>

We had a great time with our awesome guide John! He was really funny and shared a lot of great facts about San Diego. The only things we would change is that we got a late start because some members of our tour group were late. Also we had to go slow at some points because of how some people were driving their boats. It would be neat if there could be private tours where you could actually go fast the whole trip with the guide.</review>

The boats are slow and the instructor spent most of his time doubling back to help other people. We rode past the sea lions then turned around and came back. You spend most of your time cruising and then spend about 5 mins in throttle. The operation instructions aren’t very good. And it was just a total bore. We had to stay single file and weren’t able to experience the speed of the boat. If you deciding between thing a jet skis. Do the jet skis. Hell, kayaking would be better than this garbage!</Review>< Pics>

I booked a boat ride for myself and family. My son was with me and my 6yr old daughter went with dad. I was so nervous at first never driven a boat or been out that far into the bay. Let me tell you we had the most amazing time my daughter loved it even when the ride got super bumpy seemed to be when we had the most fun. The tour guy was amazing made it simple not to much to know just follow boat ahead and made us feel safe ! Worth the money definitely recommend<//text>

<Review>One of our favorite things we've done on the trip. We had a great guide, driving the speedboat was super fun, and the tour part of it was very cool. Seeing the seals and the aircraft carriers up close was SO COOL!<//Review>< pictures>

Our guide was fabulous!  I was scared at fist, being I'd never been on a speed boat. After a quick briefing and about 20 minutes in, I felt like a pro!  It was so much fun!  Thanks again. This adventure was worth every penny and we will be back soon!   You rock!!!!

The boat leader had another boat and he was an amazing host!!! He explained to us the route, told us to have fun, explained to us the different boats and much more that was on the water.

Great ride, had awesome time. For $150 you cannot do better. Only negative - some chicks in front of us couldn’t get their grip on it, almost hit a ship, then rocks. Didn’t feel safe with them behind us. This slowed down the ride of the whole group, but still, 5 stars</review>

Had a great time on the boat tour. Boats were really easy to operate. Instructors were very informative and   Helpful. It was hard to hear at times on the walkie when we were going fast, but overall it was a 5 star day. Highly recommend this tour if your in San Diego.</review>

<text>We are locals here in San Diego.  And having experience your services,  we must admit that this was one of our best days here on the water as San diegans.  But since this was a birthday celebration, it was that much more magical. Thank you so very much San Diego speed boat adventure for this memorable day.

I was hesitant to spend as much money as it cost but it was worth every penny! I have two daughters and we all fit in one boat. It's hard to find things that they both like. They absolutely loved it. I think this is a must do every time I am in San Diego! Thanks for the great experience!< /text>

This adventure was exactly as advertised.  Our guide Scott let us know before we left the dock what to expect, what the water was going to be like, and how to maneuver the boat during choppy waters. We had a great time and would definitely book another adventure with this company.<//Text>< name>

my own mistake for thinking it’s speedboat rental, it isn’t. It’s a tour. quite slow I may add. my friend had a good time, but it was
somewhat boring for me - I expected more speed from speedboat. not my cup of tea.
nice people, good crew, just hoped to get
more rush, adrenaline.

also, absence of parking is a bummer.<//Text>

<text>Loved driving the speed boats! Scott was a super nice, knowledgeable guy. I love speed so this was an unforgettable experience. I would want to come back for the summer and do this again. The check in process was easy and Scott’s guidance when in the water was super easy and fun. Loved it!!!!<//text><Resp>{'time': 1582218130748, 'text': "Hi Katie, we love to read reviews like this!

I had a great time on the water and an awesome tour guide. I scheduled earlier in the day so I was lucky enough to be the only boat on tour. Don't be afraid to go fast and jump some waves! The boats are pretty wide on the front end so they are hard to tip... The views are just breathtaking and you'll see some wildlife and some Navy ships along the way. Very cool experience!</review>

<review>This was a pretty awesome experience over all, although, we did have an issue...There were issues starting the boat which was a major problem when we stalled out in front of a charter boat and couldn't get the boat started again. I would highly suggest, to the company, some type of brief training  (or a two way radio system) to safely notify the guide of issues.< /review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

< Review>
Beware!! Scam alert!! Please be advised that the 2 hour boat ride they advertise is actually about an hour if you’re lucky. I asked our guide why we finished in an hour and he said “ well we say two hours for you to prepare for that”. Huh?? I asked the lady at the front desk which by the way when I first came in to the office, I told her I was here for my reservation she then says, “ and do you have a question?!” Yes I do, I don’t know what to do or where to go. Thanks for your attitude. She is miserable behind her desk and you won’t get much help from her. So disappointed with this tour. It is not 2 hours, and customer service is bad bad bad.<//Review>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>It’s amazing experience for us, as it was my first time in self driving speed boat.  Initially when we started the speed boat, it was so low and scary looking at the water with big boats and waves. As we moved on and followed the direction of our captain Scott , it was a fun ride all the way. I would definitely do again when we get a chance.<//review>< pics>

Really awesome adventure. You get to see the USS Midway and the nautical museum from the outside looking in. The bait barge was a cool stop as well. Really fun zipping around the bay while the naval base has helicopters and planes flying above. Totally recommend and am looking into checking out their Tampa facility.< /Text>

Decided I wanted to do this for my birthday. Even though I've lived here my whole life, it was a blast and informative. You get to see a side of San Diego that even locals don't normally see. The highlights were going underneath the Midway, up to the sea lions sunbathing and being able to fly across the water in your own little boat.</text>

We had so much fun on our Speedboats Adventure. Captain Scott was wonderful. Very nice and laid back. The boats were great, easy to handle. It was a good little tour - not too short, not too long. Seeing the sea lions was our favorite part. Such a cool thing to see. You also get to go super close, right up along side the USS Midway, Star of India, submarine, etc. it was a really great time - highly recommend this adventure!<//Text>

It is an excellent experience! You can drive by yourself and go fast as instructed by the coach. The staffs are extremely friendly and experienced. All rules and safety awareness were shared up front and the coach will lead the whole team (we had 5 boats in our team). A best experienced and definitely worth!</text>

Highlight of my visist in San diego. Visited Uss miday, star of India and also saw sea lions.

I bought two-day Go card from Costco and reserved the speed boat adverture, which is a great deal. It would be safe to call ahead to double check the reservation. The system would cancel the reservation, if Go card numbers were not entered correctly.< /text>

< Review>
San Diego Speed Boat Adventures provided me a great first time experience riding a speedboat and I had loads of fun. However, other guests slowed down frequently during the tour. Perhaps due to language barriers (and not understanding the basic instructions) or discomfort with driving fast on the waves. I don't think the tour guide discussed expectations and provided reassurance before the tour. This sparked my interest in speed boating.< /Review>

We planned the day before we go and fortunately it’s Monday which we made it. It’s a great experience and another way to explore the city. Speed boat adventure is managing very efficient and definitely easy to work with. Thanks to the stuff who’s guiding us today. We’ll recommend to our friends as well.< /Text>

We had a great time - we needed to change dates and the manager Chris was accommodating and helpful!  We went today and had an awesome experience! We got a full 2hr tour of the harbor. We saw seals and sea lions and viewed the USS Midway from underneath along with the Maritime Museum and of course the beautiful Coronado Bridge and City Skyline from boating on the water.  It was GREAT!  Will definitely go again soon!  Thanks</Review>

<text>Easy to make a reservation, friendly service from beginning to end and the speed boat was SO MUCH FUN!   Captain Duck (that’s what he said we could call him) was great with making sure he explained how the boat worked, the area we’d be traveling & even giving us some history on local landmarks (hard to hear him at times due to engine noise).  This is definitely an activity to do if you are visiting or if you’re a local.  Hint:  great 1st date activity,)</text>< UserId.>

The speed boats were a ton of fun to take out on the ocean. They are safe and the tour guides are fun without taking you around to sit and do nothing. Was very fun for adults. I would do it again.</review>

I brought my six-year-old on this speed boat adventure. It was super fun. At first it was a little intimidating when I heard the instructors giving details of how to drive the boat. But it really is much more simple than you think it will be. When we got off our flight at the San Diego airport, it is only an eight dollar cab ride away. We had a few hours before we could check into our hotel so we headed over and it was good decision!. They held our bags for us which was really nice!
All in all, a wonderful way to start our vacation< /review>

The adventure itself was very fun.  Our guide was very good and he did his best with people who quite frankly couldn’t follow very basic instructions on how to operate the boats and operate them safely.  The boat in front of of got us into dangerous situations because the driver did not apply full throttle for fast moving as instructed and was to worried about the pictures his wife or girlfriend was taking.  Having been in boats before and extensive maritime and air safety training, I was able to operate and make it look as if nothing out of the ordinary was occurring- other than the jackass in front of us being well behind the boats in front of him.  I am surprised if there has not been accidents or injuries in theses boats as people always think they know much more than they do and want to be aggressive and boastful rather than safe and conservative in their decision making.  It was a great way to see the harbor in a fun way.  I wouldn’t do it again, mostly for safety reasons.<//Text>

The speed boat ride was really awesome. We called in morning for reservations, luckily they were able to accommodate us for 5pm ride. Scott was our tour guide. He would drive in his boat in infront and we need to follow him on our speed boats. He always keep eye on us if we need any help or if we speeding too much or too slow. Our boat motor caught a plastic carried by high wind from earlier day. All we have to do is wave to Scott. He is the best tour guide ever. I only drove car twice in my life till this ride. Scott made sure we came back in one piece and have as much fun as we could.< /Text>

<review>My husband and I were looking for something fun to do in San Diego and stumbled upon Speedboat Adventures.. and boy, I’m glad we did! We’ve done harbor cruises/tours before but this was 10x better than any of those experiences! I loved that we got to drive our own small speedboat. It went a lot faster than I expected.. I was screaming and laughing the whole time! Our tour guide was cool too.. very informative and fun!

The women at the desk was SO nice and great.  The two men gave clear instructions, although it may be easier if uve driven a boat before, if not it's not hard to pick up as they walk you through the steps.  I am not giving it 5 stars because I wouldn't call the boats speedboats...though the experience was fun all the same!<//Review>

Amazing time and perfect for thrill seekers! My bf is in a wheelchair and unable to use his legs.  Neither of us can swim and it was our first time ever in a speedboat! Rick was our guide and at one point our "3 boats away" distance became "30 boats away" lol and he came back and helped us catch up! It was an awesome and safe experience and totally a must do!!

Don't go to this place if you use Go San Diego Cards! We did make a reservation a few days ago. But we were asked for rescheduling just two hours before the check-in time. And it seems like the attendant took this for granted, which was so disrespectful.  It was too urgent for us to change our plan, so we canceled the reservation. As we asked for an email confirmation of this change, the answer was not friendly, either. Based on this experience, we think probably Go Cards reservations are prone to last-minute changes.</Text>

My wife and I bought the Go San Diego card and we're trying to find something to do one of the mornings and decided to give this a try. We absolutely loved it. Looking back on our trip in the airport we actually felt like this was the most enjoyable thing we did while we were in San Diego. For those of you who are wondering how it works, we called and made a reservation for the next morning, which was really easy, filled out some waivers online, showed up the next morning and got to drive our own little speed motor boats on a tour around the harbor. It was such an awesome experience. We loved our guide Ryan, and everything we got to see and experience while out driving our own boats! You absolutely should sign up for this if you buy a Go San Diego card, even if you don't have the card, I'd highly recommend this tour!< /Text>

<Review>They canceled last minutes the night before.  We made reservations 3 days before!!!   They are completely unreliable!  I would never do business with them again!!!
Update:  After they canceled our reservation last minutes, they called back.  They were able to offer us to a later time slot.  We had a great time.  I would definitely recommend the adventure to others visiting San Diego.</Review><Rate>4</Rate><GmapID>0x80deab6b310efb73:0x92512bd5733c94d9<//GmapID><user>103629023149316409164< /user>< username>

Decided to do the 2hr speed boat with my boyfriend from 9am to 11am and it was definitely an adventure. I'm not an adventurer at all but my boyfriend is so I decided it would be a fun thing to do while in San Deigo. You get to see the city from the speed boat in a way you wouldn't on land which is nice. Our guide from Tampa was very friendly and explained how to use the boat. If you are looking to have a memorable experience in San Diego besides the usual stroll book this 2 hr speed boat adventure (one boat fits two people). You will be able to take tons of pics and video on your phone just fine. Be sure to wear sunglasses and a hat. Thanks speedboat adventure team as this was the highlight of our trip. What are you waiting for? Book it, you won't regret it!< /Text>

also a good way to introduce boating for people who have never been on a speed boat.

I recommend it, it was definitely fun I wish there was little more freedom to explore the harbor on your own but it’s a group thing.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< response>

<Review>The highlight of our day. This tour was exactly what we wanted, informative and entertaining narrative as we explored the bay, and between stops the thrill of racing along the waves. We've done this twice, and my wife and I both think it is a great value.

The staff is energetic and friendly, safety conscious and entertaining. The entire business is the kind that you want to see successfull.

Calm days are great for families and kids, but if you want a real thrill, go when its windy. The larger waves mean a thrilling ride that would put most rollercoasters to shame. Some boats are faster then others, but I'm not telling, this way I can keep them to myself when I come back!

Wish I could give 10 stars.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Such a FUN way to see the city!  My husband and I have spent a little time on boats so we were super excited to do this tour.  Having our own speed boat to play around with in the bay sounded like the perfect way to spend an afternoon.  We did the 3pm tour which was the perfect time of day – not too hot!  You get a quick lesson and overview of what you will see then you head out on the boats.  Its about a 2 hour tour around the bay and worth EVERY penny.  Our guide was Jason and he was fantastic – very fun as well as knowledgeable about boats and the San Diego.   If you have two people that want to drive, you can switch ½ way through.  This is a great activity for people visiting San Diego, or even San Diego natives like us!<//Review>

It's like going to a grocery store with one coupon and asking them to scan it more than once to get a bigger discount. It doesn't work like that. In your case you found a promo code and entered it more than once to get a total of 28% off of your tour. We did not catch it when the reservation was made but when you arrived we saw that you used the same promo code twice. I know you thought you could get by without us catching it...but you got caught."}< /Response>

Due to this time I booked trip from passport website, it can use 2 times discount code on official website, but when I arrival registered counter, employee said the discount code just use one times , so she plus 20.37 USD in my payment , it was bad experience on customers feeling , hope it can write discount principles clearly. Customers will not be confused about payment. can you add "poka yoke" function on your website ? if one promotion code input twice, it should show " double input same promotion code"< /Text>

We have used San Diego twice, and both times were wonderful!
We had Hampton as our guide the first time and Trevor the second time.
Both were fun and fabulous! You will NOT be disappointed. They are very knowledgeable and accommodating. Couldn't be happier.</Review>

Update: they called back and were willing to reschedule us for 1:00 PM the day we were supposed to go, even though the San Diego Go Pass is technically only for the 9:00 or 11:00 AM timeslots. And honestly - this was one of the highlights of our stay in San Diego. Don't think we've ever laughed and screamed quite that much. We had a blast out on the water, and our tour guide was excellent. Would rate 5/5 if not for the initial cancellation. Highly recommend for anyone in the San Diego area.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1562445897343, 'text': 'Hi Brent,\n\nWe deeply apologize for having to cancel and reschedule you last minute.

The captain was very friendly and had alot of patience.   That was the good part.  The boats were another story.  2 out of 6 boats had speed.   The others were sluggish and slow.  Very frustrating when they advertise speed boats but really they are slow.  For the amount of money being charged, they should invest a little in their boats.</Text>

Speed boat was soo much fun. It was included in go pass. Guide was awesome. Its in the harbor so the waves are not big. Keep distance from other speed boats and you wont feel any waves.< /review>

<Text>Good but was expecting more of a speed. The customer service and employees great, route / tour views were nice but boats are kind of outdated and engines on most of the boats (at least in our group tour) were 30hp so it’s not too much “Fun to drive”. We got this as part of Go Pass San Diego so can’t complain much but definitely won’t pay full price for it.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Amazing. Zach was great. Easy going and informative. There was emphasis on safety that was perfectly balanced between not being dangerous and letting each boat have fun. Great tour. Would definitely recommend and do again. Prepare to get a little wet from mist and wind so a light jacket may be helpful but on a nice sunny day t-shirt and shorts or pants are fine too. Just expect a little wetness. Think log ride at Disney or Knott's. Maybe less if you go straight and don't want to zig zag and stop and go to quickly.<//text>

Me and girlfriend decided to speed boat adventure on Sunday afternoon. We were on vacation and wanted to have fun. I forgot my captain name but while giving the instruction he said not all the boats are same means some of the boats motar is new and some is old. Let's put it this way I got the lucky one. It was alright and we didn't even speed halfway because we had to get from the doc. I didn't knew i had the lucky one. While we were in the middle of the ocean our captain said speed up and mine didn't speed up. We all were giving number of our boat and I was told since you've issues going on you go last. The whole adventure I couldn't speed up and the captain itself apologized to me. Next day i call the corporate owner it self talked with me and said let me find out all the details and I will give you call back. He didn't called me so I called again next day and said everything was fine captain didn't say anything about that boat. I was like am I lying ?? Why would i waste my time I'm being honest and boat clearly had the issue. Ended up giving me 30% off my final bill but I still think it wasn't worth it because paying $150 to get the adventure but I didn't got one.< /review>< Pictures>

Terrible experience. We bought san diego go card from costco and this was one of the attractions we looked forward to do, however, it turned out to be a nightmare for me and my wife. We did this on Jun 30, 9 am. It was fine for first 30 minutes or so and all of a sudden our boat stopped working and we were left stranded in the middle of the ocean for more than 45 minutes. We did everything. We gave the distress signs, whistled to get the guides attention but in vain. He did not spot us because he sped off,  as a guide he should have made sure everyone are following before he took off or atleast stay in the middle so he can spot every rider. We called the office and she tried to reach the guide and in the meantime our boat was driven by the ocean winds as the steering does not work. It was SCARY!! It took the guide 45 minutes to spot us and rather than being appologetic we were shocked when he had asked us how we ended up here. The wind dragged the boat to other end of the ocean. We were so excited to do this but it turned out to be a "LOST" adventure. I will not be recommending this to my friends and family. The guide should always keep track of the riders. Period!! Unable to locate us for almost 45 minutes in the middle of ocean is unacceptable.<//Review>
<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1563564981645, 'text': 'Hello Kota Vijay,  Thank you for taking the time to review our tour.  We are very sorry that you had trouble on our tour.  The main rule we have on tour is to follow the boat in front of you.  This was the rule that you were unable to follow.  The entire tour turned left and you went the opposite direction which then caused you to run your boat aground which is what caused it to stall.  That is why we ask everyone to follow in a single file line as there are shallow spots in San Diego Bay. By doing this you ruined the tour for all the other boats while the tour guide had to search for you.  We have had thousands of guests come out on our tour and some have never driven a car and most have never driven a boat yet there is never an issue of one of the boats just taking off from the tour route.  Once again we are very sorry that you had a less than pleasant time on our tour but if you had followed the directions given by your guide this situation would have never happened.  Thank you.'}< /Resp><GmapID>0x80deab6b310efb73:0x92512bd5733c94d9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

At first i was nervous because I had never been on a speed boat or anything like it before. But once we got out there it was so beautiful so informative and so much fun. Flying around on the boats while the tour guide keeps you safe doing it is awesome. I would recommend it to anyone. Our guide was jason and he gave us so much information about everything we were seeing. We even got to go underneath the uss midway. You got to slow down at certain points and see everything and get the best pictures. Will definitely be back< /text>

<text>Amazing tour, great guide.  It was so neat to see the famous boats and the sea lions up close from the water side!  I will say that my assigned boat had technical issues, but the guide was super attentive and kept coming back to re-start it (after I tried and failed).  Didn't hinder us for long; it was exhilarating speeding thru the ocean.  If you do it, count on getting wet with ocean spray at minimum, and wear sunscreen.  Thanks for a great ride!< /text><pics>None< /pics><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<review>We had a terrible experience with this outfit. Several boats had broken down on our tour. The gas line and radio were broken on our boat leaving my 5 year old and Floating in the harbor for an hour. The owner offered to give us another trip because ours was so bad and when we returned this summer reneged and offered us 50% of our next tour. Bad management and very bad equipment don’t waste your money go rent a jet ski and way more fun.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x80deab6b310efb73:0x92512bd5733c94d9</gmapID></record>

Everything is fine, until something goes wrong. Your guide will loose its temper, shout and yell at you and at the end, he left us alone. Frustrating. Irresponsible. And for sure unprofessional and a no-go for this price.
1. If you are taller than 6', we cannot recommend this tour. We have bruises all over our knees.
2. If the two people in the boat are heavier than 400 lbs, we cannot recommend this. You will have to push your weight to the front of the boat for getting it "on plane", which basically means to get speed. In the beginning you will have additional weight of the full gas tank in the front to get you going. But at the end of the tour, your weight will not be enough to push down the nose of the boat and you will never get "on plane" anymore. The Guide (Bob or Rob) will make you keep trying, but if you have any understanding of physics, it is simply not possible anymore because of your weight and the mass distribution. Usually boats have a trim to adjust the motor to this weight distribution. But these boats are simple and small and don't have it or the guide didn't tell or know about it.
3. We had rather big waves. This also interrupts the traction to the water, which doesn't allow you to get speed. We ended up trying and failing.

The thing is, this trip is not a sightseeing tour. Don't expect that. You will be busy getting control over your boat and to follow the guide. He is alone in his boat and way ahead of you. They do not offer a two-way radio, there is only a speaker in the boat and while you are standing, leaning over the bow to get on plane, you will not hear a single word he says. After we mentioned this to him, he simply said "I know". How helpful is that? There are not even hand signals agreed on to have a minimum of communication with the guide.

When stopped the 2nd time, he told us that because of our problems in the beginning there will be no stop on the tour anymore. He more or less blamed us to ruin the tour for everybody else. Honestly, we didn't wanted to stop anymore and just go back. But guess what... Of course he stopped again, I ignored him first and got yelled at me again over the intercom... So I stopped and never got the boat on plane again. We were lying on the bow for the rest of the tour. Our knees hurt, our back and neck hurt. The guide was annoyed, rude and not helpful at all. If someone is yelling at you, that "nobody ever had these problems", I can tell you to read Yelp. There a dozens of reviews stating the same problems and the same carelessness. It was frustrating and nothing, we will recommend.

It might be a lot of fun, if you get speed. But there a a lot of factors, that could prevent you to get "on plane". And if so, it is no fun at all. The guide is not prepared for this situation and you might end up paying a lot of money for bad service.<//Review>

<Text>Loads of fun! You will have to pay for parking but this one is worth it. You are driving a 2 seater small speed boat at maybe 30 to 40 mph and get very up close with all the sights around the bay. You can do it even if you are inexperienced with watercrafts. This was one of the funnest things we did in San Diego.</Text>< user_id>

Called for reservation.  Received a call back. Said that he would check availability, that he had tours scheduled, and would call me right back. That was two hours ago. I called again and rang to VM. Boats are still tied to dock (obviously there was not a tour scheduled as he claimed) Seems really great if they actually let you go on it. Wasted two hours of vacation time waiting on the call back. Poor customer service that I don't appreciate.</Text>

<review>If you need a quick, cheap cut and your usual babes is tied up come here. Nothing special. Assembly line setup. They get you in and out. Not that it matters, but the barbers are all Asian. Ive just never been to a barber like it. Needless to say, I was skeptical from the jump. Its hard being a Minority, finding a barber that knows how to cut your hair in this area. This place does the job, but its lackluster to say the least. $15 for a basic cut.</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO4Y1FzxEXRQ5HymMUx-OS0RrzJYBcI5yhoXEnT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x808fb653d8695b1f:0x5d3572f74dfd1fc2</Gmap_id></record>

<review>Unfortunately I made the bad decision to try this place a second time. The first time I took my 8yr old son and the female barber had zero patience. I ended up walking out because she was so rude. Today (2 yrs later) I was pressed for time and this is the only place open at 8am. I got the same rude woman. She didn’t even ask how I wanted my haircut and just started working. I had to stop her to tell her how I wanted it and she seemed agitated that I would even make the suggestion. So, if you ever see me in this place again, please do me a favor and shoot me.< /review>< pictures>

<review>Some of the barbers are actually not bad, but some shouldn't even be cutting hair. They are very rude, always in a rush, and don't really pay attention to what the customer wants. I've gotten plenty of bad haircuts from here. If its cheap and fast, it's not going to good!</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

I loved this place! They were quick, straight forward and knew exactly how to cut my hair. I had to give no input. They put so much detail in my cut as well, unlike other places where they buzz you then cut you loose, their staff took the time to make the best cut possible. They used the razor, the shaving blade with cream, scissors, and multiple brushes to style my hair right. I gave them a 100% tip and took their business card.  I will definitely be back again.< /text>

<text>Didn’t understand English properly.

Didn’t cut the hair even when told.

Kept 50% tip automatically by not returning any money and just say thank you.

Only takes cash. Wonder why?

Started putting cheap gel in my hair without asking me.

Sorry. I’m actually going to a chain near by to fix what you couldn’t understand.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Been coming here for over 15 years. My boys grew up getting their haircut here. Great place.
Only one person I go to for a haircut. The lady on the second station from the window works magic.  At first I brought pictures on how I want my haircut. Now I just sit and she goes to work. I have been recommending this place to all my friends.
I live in San Jose (Fremont before that) and I drive to Sunnyvale just for this place.<//text>

Going here is always a bit intimidating since some of the barbers don't have great English. I've never left with a bad haircut though, which is impressive since my hair is usually pretty long (I go 4-5 months between cuts). Showing them a photo is easier than trying to explain what you want.< /Review>

There is a old guy in the left most chair. He cut my hair in a most uneven way. I shown him a photo what is the style I need.He neither cut it in a similar way nor did a decent job. I am going to another shop to fix my hair. What a waste of time and money.</review>

The prices are great, and the quality of the cuts are as good or better than any of the name brand salons in the area.  I've been going here for over a year, and haven't been disappointed once.< /text>< Pics>

<text>I have been an on and off visitor for the past few years, quite professional and quick if you point a design from the available photos on the wall and reasonably priced too. A recent experience with one of the stylists who had bad breath led to a less than satisfactory cut, thankfully it was over quickly< /text>< Pics>

<Review>Hit and miss overall.  The dudes are usually quite rough, especially when it comes to beard trimming which means if you have sensitive skin then you're going to get beard rash.  The ladies are much better for the most part and they don't reek of cigarette smoke as the dudes do</Review><gmapID>0x808fb653d8695b1f:0x5d3572f74dfd1fc2< /gmapID></record>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>If you like Las Vegas, you'll love Alpha!

Usually I play $10 haircut roulette and walk away none the poorer from Alpha Barbershop, but be warned, unlike Vegas, what happens in Alpha Barbershop doesn't stay in Alpha Barbershop. After telling the guy cutting my hair not to touch the sideburns or beard and to "leave it" he proceeded to shave off half my beard. I actually had him just stop outright.

I was able to mostly "fix it" with some creative grooming once I got home, but if I were still competing in beard contests I'd be livid. For $10 it's definitely a value, but don't be too surprised if you walk out with only a close approximation of what you asked for.</text>< pics>

<Review>If you need a haircut that is exceedingly simple then I would be willing to say okay. But if you require any level of finesse or complexity to your hair, such as my friends with long wavy hair like myself, please stay as far away as possible. My hair was butchered by one of the women that work there and I'm frankly embarrassed to walk outside. I left as soon as I could and will not be returning, now I have to go get it done somewhere else to fix it. Would not recommend, but the guys with short simple hair might be okay.</Review>< name>

<review>$10 is cheap.  But, they put machine on the sides which means it is going to be incredibly short on the sides.  Apparently, it is not our choice to have them use scissors to keep it slightly long.  He asked me whether I am new the moment I asked him to put scissors.  I was a bit surprised by that question.  But, the guy knew what he was doing, and he did a pretty good job. Infact, because of the shortness, this haircut may last couple of extra weeks before I have to go next time.  A positive in a slightly negative situation.  But, not bad overall.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

If you view a haircut as a bimonthly chore, this is the perfect place. It is fast and cheap. I can walk in, get a haircut, and get out in under 20 minutes. There is almost never a line. The men's haircut is a bargain at only $11.< /text>

<Text>Once you find the right Barber here, this place is solid. Like other reviews, the price can't be beat. $15 (tip included) for me every other week is perfection, and like I said about finding the right Barber, once you do, you get consistency in the quality and overall service.< /Text>< Pictures>

I've been getting my hair cut here since I first arrived in the US 16 years ago. If you want an expert gentleman's barbers shop, rather than a flouncy salon, this is your place. They even finish you off with a cut-throat razor. In all that time, I have never once had a bad haircut.  And the price has only increased from $8 to $10. Highly recommend it.<//review>

I've been getting haircuts at Alpha every few weeks for over 20 years but the quality and service has seriously declined.  It was much better when it was a few old guys who were very good at their job. The last straw: yesterday as I was walking up one of the new ladies, without even looking outside, flipped the closed sign and locked the door 15 minutes early because there was a crowd. I looked through the window but was ignored by the new people who don't know me.  As a customer I'm nice,  never complain and always give a $10 tip to my barber.   I'm sad to see it go as a long tradition but I won't  return to Alpha.  It's not as good as it once was.<//Review>

<review>WORST & RUDE - Too Fast to be decent cut
1) The tall asian women did not care, what I wanted. She openly said "she will cut as it is" . So the model photos shown there are namesake.
2) She finished cut in about 10 minutes and asked me to check. When I checked for about 4-5 seconds, she literally told me "tell cut more don't cut" ( she meant I have to say one or other answer right away).
When I asked her to trim my sideline, she made exactly three scissor strokes for about 5 seconds and said "thank you" removing the cape/gown .
3) When I left I found that  they accept no cards and  I have exactly $10 in cash which is amount of men's cut. I should have given that and left. But I apologized to her and stepped out to bring cash from my car. This lady followed watching me to ensure I don't run away not paying. I felt insulted. I tipped her just $2 and left.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fb653d8695b1f:0x5d3572f74dfd1fc2<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I wasn't sure what I needed, only that I wanted it short. I got an excellent cut, he left it a little longer on top, and it looks good, glad I trusted his judgement. Other barbers sometimes just go over your whole head with the number 4 clippers This one took some care with the scissors to get it right. The price can't be beat, but I tipped well because it such a nice cut.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Male hair cutter was awful. Uneven and patches of too short trimming on sides. He didn't seem to know how to use scissors, so he just skipped half my hair. Maybe that was good thing, and someone else can at least fix that part....<//Review>

Very nice shop - reasonably priced - and the staff doesn't talk which is something I prefer [I'm not interested in making idle chatter].< /text>

<Review>Let me preface this review by saying that I just got the WORST HAIRCUT I HAVE EVER GOTTEN.  PERIOD.  I go in to the place and ask for a simple haircut.  Shorter than it is now.  The lady cutting my hair, who doesn't speak english, starts pointing to pictures on the wall.  I try explaining what I want, but she keeps pointing at pictures.  She points at one, and I say "too short."  To which she responds what I thought was "more hair??"  and i say yes.  Turns out what she said was "mohawk"... I DID NOT WANT A MOHAWK.  By the time i realize what is happening she has completely shaved the right side of my head, and it is too late to salvage the haircut.  I try to work with her to make it look remotely good, but it was a complete fail.  Worst haircut i have ever gotten.<//Review>< gmap_id>

<Text>I'm a Marine who left active duty and just rejoined in the reserves, and I was in a last minute scenario needing a haircut to get on base. So I found this place, showed the guy a picture I googled of a good medium reg, and it was not only the fastest haircut I've gotten, but it was a perfect haircut, exactly what I asked for.< /Text>< Pics>

Basic haircut: cheap, effective, they vacuum you off afterward and give a hot shaving cream/straight razor treatment. Why go anywhere else?</text>

Yesterday I experienced a worst haircut I my life, I just entered in to the alpha one lady received me I shown a photo of haircut (spikes) which i maintain it from past four years d he said ok and started she done trimming my hair four sides and scissor cut just three to five cuts that's it said I am done I kept blank just looking at my face is this spikes I said to her again I need spikes then she said apply gel make hair up that is spikes lol...... I just came from there back never looking back after paying the amount. Now I feel sad to look my face. I suggestion to you guys vist this alpha when u need short hair style or baby cut they fit for it.< /review>

They are super responsive, knowledgeable and most importantly, reputable in the Bay Area, which is a must for most sellers when making an offer. My sister and her partner worked with Brady to purchase their home and referred us when we purchased ours and we all couldn't be happier! I highly recommend them if you are looking for a lender in the Bay.

I especially loved the donation policy they have at the end of the loan process, always cool to see small businesses giving back to charity.< /Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95<//gmapID></record>

<review>This was by far the best loan experience I have ever had (home, car, etc)! Brady Thomas and team made the process thorough, expedient and painless.  When I had a question, Brady or a member of his team responded quickly.  They were persistent, but kind with follow up emails making sure I was completing all of the necessary documents in a timely manner and not missing deadlines.  They didn't let anything fall through the cracks. Brady found the right financing plan for my needs, and successfully guided me through every step of the way and I need more hand holding than most. I am so thankful for the quality and commitment of the entire Thomas Team.  An added bonus is that they send you a lovely gift as a thank you.  I couldn't be more pleased with the entire experience.</review>< GmapID>

Brady and his team know how to close a loan! Brady gave us excellent advice throughout the home-buying process, was very responsive as is needed in this competitive housing market, and got us a great loan that fit our criteria.  It was a pleasant experience, we got a great loan, and we didn’t have to call 10 banks to determine rates and loan parameters.  We would happily use Brady again for our mortgage needs.<//text>

<Review>We were extremely happy with Brady, Elizabeth, and everyone else at Team Thomas! They took the time to patiently explain each step of the process and to answer all of our many questions. All throughout our multi-year home search, we were confident that having Team Thomas on our side would ease the closing process once we finally found the right home. Thank you again to everyone at Team Thomas for helping us in the process of successfully buying our first home!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>I would give Brady and his team 10 stars if I could!

I had worked with a few other brokers who ran my credit multiple times, had long wait times in between communications, and ultimately weren't able to refinance for me.

Brady Thomas was recommended by a colleague and I cannot be happier with our experience. He took the time to answer all of my many, many, many questions, was transparent through the whole process, and was able to close my refinance with ease.

I'm so appreciative for their work and will 110% use them again for all future financing.<//text><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Brady Thomas and his team at LaSalle Financial were exceptional to work with. From the moment of contact all the way through funding, it was an easy and seamless process.

Every transaction was well communicated and extremely convenient using e-signature ‘s, zoom meetings, and digital documentation. The only in person meetings required were with the appraiser and mobile notary, both of which were scheduled quickly and around our convenience.

Brady was clear with our options and was quick to jump on a call to explain anything we had questions about. His depth of experience and understanding is also evident in the advice and direction he provides.

Among the most impressive with Brady and his team are the clear directions in each item we needed to provide, their response time, and quick turn-around times.

Loans and refinancing can be a bit daunting and are notoriously known to draw out for long periods. My father started his process with another firm 6 months ago and is still waiting, ours was done in under 40 days from rate-lock to funding.

This is our second opportunity working with Brady and it’s just as great as the first. Highly recommend.<//Text>< Pics>

We just closed on our Refi with Brady and his team and they all made the process as smooth, accessible, easy, and expedient as can be. I was nervous going in as an independent contractor and from the first consult with Brady he assured me that I was a viable candidate - and I was! Their covid protocols seamlessly moved almost every aspect of the refi online and it could not have been simpler. Brady and his team were very communicative and clear. I'm SO grateful for their organization, expertise, and guidance. Thanks, Team Brady!<//text>

<review>Brady and team recently helped my wife and I purchase our first home.  As first time buyers we had no idea what we were doing; but they walked us through each step of the process of obtaining financing, providing timely guidance that made us feel confident and secure in our decisions and actions. On a personal note: I have known Brady since middle school, and he has always been a first rate person, which is why we sought him out.  I would wholeheartedly recommend Brady and team to anyone who asked.< /review>< Rating>

Brady was fantastic. He ensured we closed on time and was even available on Sundays to write us letters for home offers. Buying a house is stressful but all the various parties we interacted with already knew Brady and sang his professional praises, which provided needed comfort. This is an easy choice- work with Brady!</review>

<review>I worked with Brady on financing my first home purchase. The overall experience was great: Brady and his team took care of every details from the financial side and allowed me and wife to solely focus on the house search. I especially liked the fact that Brady was very responsive to any question I had - and I had many, given that this was my first home purchase. I would definitely work again with Brady in the future.</review><Rating>5</Rating><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>Brady is one of the best help you can get out there

If you are a first time home buyer and are worried or overwhelmed just by the though of the process, don't worry, it's quite normal. To get through this overwhelming process of buying a house you need someone experienced and amazing who will hand hold you through the whole process. For us that person was Brady and his team.

They are truly amazing, and I say this not just because we got our mortgage loan approved through him. A couple of months back my wife and I were completely clueless about the whole loan process. We had an initial conversation with Brady during which he calmly and in complete details answered all of our questions, and those answers never changed as we moved forward in the process, which tells you a great deal about the transparency with which Brady and his team function. Through the whole process of getting pre approved to loan funding, Brady and Elizabeth (Team Thomas) answered all of our questions and kept us up-to date with our application progress. We had heard rumors about how taxing and annoying the loan process can be, but for us it was smooth sailing, thanks to Brady and Elizabeth.

If you feel you need a similar smooth sailing experience, I would highly recommend everyone reading this comment to reach out to Brady for your mortgage needs. I am sure you will soon be writing a similar all praise comment for Brady and his team.</Review><name>Aakash Abhay Yadav</name><userid>100745332935059691902<//userid>< Pics>

Brady, Liz and all the staff at Team Thomas were a key part of making my first home buying experience very smooth and (nearly) stress free! They provided clear instructions by email at every stage of the process, responded quickly to all communications and were able to get on the phone at short notice if we had any questions that required explanation. Whenever we spoke, everyone was friendly and knowledgeable which put us at ease. Brady also made sure to help us take steps to get the best rate (we paid down my credit card early to get another credit rescore). Everything ran according to schedule, we were happy with our loan and we are excited to move into our new house. Thanks Team Thomas!</review>

Highly recommend! Due to the fact we had foreign property ownership, our dossier was complicated to say the least, and Brady + team persevered to get us across the finish line and into our new place. Echoing all the reviews, transparency, patience, and honesty throughout the whole process.<//review>

Awesome job on my refi!  Brady and his team made this as easy as it could be.  They were available seemingly at all hours to ensure everything proceeded swiftly and without issue.  Brady himself was extremely knowledgeable of the mortgage options available and provided excellent guidance regarding how I should consider both long term and short term impacts of various refinancing choices.<//review>

Brady made buying a house in the Bay Area a reality! Which, as you probably know, seems like an impossible dream. I'm a single mom, nonprofit professional too. The odds were stacked against me and not only did I get a house, but I got the EXACT one I wanted! What? Brady and Elizabeth were clear, super easy to work with, encouraging and honest, and held my hand each step of the crazy journey. It is one, whoa boy. Paperwork for days, decisions that have to be made within hours or days...but I was in the best care. Between them and Brook Baird at Compass, it was a dream team to make my dream come true!</Text>

<Text>Brady and his team are incredibly talented, responsive, and competent, and I couldn't recommend them more highly. Brady served as our mortgage broker for both a refinance and a new home purchase, and he made what can normally be very painful processes easy. He was very good at laying out our options and talking us through issues in simple, easy to understand terms. He got us great rates, and even helped us work through some tricky situations (a home purchase too soon after a refi, a home equity loan we had trouble closing, etc.). Brady made himself available at all times during our home search - including the weekend of one of his employee's weddings - so that we could provide a pre-approval letter at a moment's notice, and he was patient when we bugged him about how the loan was progressing and when we might close. He was able to facilitate a quick and clean loan process, which helped us secure the house of our dreams. Definitely reach out to Brady, Lindsay, and the whole team when you need mortgage assistance!< /Text>< Pics>

Brady Thomas and his team are just terrific: very professional, very thorough, and very good at sorting through the problems that come up. Brady and the team respond quickly to questions and make a complicated process much easier. Contribution to a favorite local charity was a nice bonus.  This was as painless as a painful process could be, and they really did all the hard work; my wife and I both thought they were excellent.<//review>

<Review>Brady and Team Thomas were recommended to us by a friend and I would pass the recommendation on to anyone purchasing a home in California (especially Bay area). They were very knowledgeable, and able to advise us effectively at the very beginning of the process to get pre-approved for an amount that we could actually afford and with some unique factors (second mortgage, gifts, etc.). And then once we'd identified a target home, they were efficient and diligent in collecting our information and documentation to guide us through to close in less than 30 days (over the year-end holidays). Huge thanks to Brady and team - they literally made it look easy!< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95<//gmap_id></record>

I would highly recommend Brady and his staff.  Searching for a home in the Bay Area was a lengthly and trying process, but Brady took the time to help us get started and understand what was in our range, answered all the questions that were unique to our situation, and was very quick with a letter every time we found a house that we liked that we wanted to make an offer on.  And when one of our offers was finally accepted, he and his team guided us smoothly through the closing process.  All this was done remotely during the COVID pandemic, but I never felt like our case was lost in the shuffle, and always knew they were looking out for us with a personal touch.</Review>

Buying a house is probably one of the most important and most expensive purchases that a lot of us will get in a whole life-time. So you really can't underestimate the importance of people that you will choose to help you on that journey! Especially in a crazy Bay Area market!!!

Brady Thomas and his Team are everything you could wish for in a process of getting a mortgage for your future house! Brady was pretty much the first person that we talked to and I knew right away that I wanted to work with them. They got us pre-approved and showed us multiple options that we could've gone with, they explained all the calculations and scenarios, so when we started bidding on houses we knew exactly where we stand. We won the bidding war with a second offer because we liked the house so much we were willing to bid the max and Brady's Team were supporting us throughout the whole process! They get job DONE!

Buying a house was my biggest goal and dream for the last 7 years and dreams do come true! - you just need to pick the right professionals to work with!

Thank you to La Salle Mortgage, Brady, Elizabeth and the rest of the Team! We're beyond excited to move into our new home and can't be more appreciative!<//Text>

Brady was super helpful throughout the entire process.

Bidding was competitive, and Brady's close relationships with the agents in the area was really helpful during the stressful process in making sure we were able to put in a winning bid on a house we loved.

Brady helped me get my first house, so I'm not sure how he compares to other mortgage brokers. That being said he and his team were helpful, responded to emails very quickly, and seemingly didn't get annoyed at my myriad of dumb questions. They outlined the process from start to finish, and reiterated the steps we had left each time we got through one.< /Review>

Brady and his team came as a recommendation from a friend. This was our first time buying a home and the whole process before entering it seemed really overwhelming. We knew we wanted to work with folks who can be a good partner in our home buying process. We felt good after our call with Brady and glad we went with his team. They provided just enough information to help us understand the loan process and was with us throughout every stage. We appreciated the response time especially with how busy it has been during COVID. We almost always heard back from them within a few hours. All their instructions were clear from start to finish. Super responsive and communicative. They also provided information upfront as we were preparing our first offer even before we asked! An added bonus was that they made a contribution to an organization of our choice once the loan was closed. We love working with folks are committed to supporting the community as well. We would definitely recommend Brady and his team.</review>< Name>

Working with Brady and team was a quick and efficient experience.  Everything was done virtually and as soon as we sent in the required information, we were asked to docusign the forms and everything went smoothly to the finish. I would highly recommend this agent if you want things done correctly and in a timely manner.< /Review>

I would give Brady and Team Thomas 1000+ stars if I could!! After many friends having great experiences, we worked with Brady and Team
Thomas to purchase our new home. The level of professionalism, responsiveness, transparency, *detailed step by step* communication, support and friendliness made our loan process perhaps the easiest part of our sell/buy. Brady is an absolute whiz- brilliant and knowledgeable, a phenomenal communicator. His team goes above and beyond in every capacity. Each person we worked with was fantastic!! I cannot recommend them enough. You will be in excellent hands!! - Jeana Pfeifer</Text>

<Review>Brady and his team were excellent and communicative all the way throughout my loan process. They answered questions immediately and made sure I stayed on top of everything I needed in order to close on time. Their instructions were clear and understandable. Brady was recommended to me by my real estate agent and I was not disappointed. His team really looks out for you. Keep up the great work, Team Thomas!< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Experience was seamless and fast. Staff very accessible and answered all questions promptly. I already recommended the services to someone else. I closed in about 30 days even with COVID. Much easier than any other Refi or purchase I have done in the past.<//review>

Brady Thomas and his team helped us with a mortgage on our first home in Oakland, California. As first-time buyers, we had little idea of what we were doing. Brady gave us detailed explanations and clear instructions every step of the way, which made our experience smooth and seamless. We have friends who really struggled with getting their paperwork in order for their lender, but this was not our experience at all! Brady was always available to follow up and answer any additional questions that would come up.

In a hyper-competitive housing market like the East Bay, we found it really beneficial to work with a local lender like Brady. We would absolutely work with him and his team again when we’re thinking of refinancing or purchasing our next home.<//Text>

I had the best experience on a recent refinance with Brady, Elizabeth, and Team Thomas. From my initial outreach to Brady based on a bank referral, I experienced their committment to serving their client with respect, transparency, and integrity. While completing a refinace in 2020 proved to be an incredibly lengthy process, I never once felt out of touch or unaware of where I was in the process. Brady and his team far exceeded my expectations. I have referred friends and family to them for their loan needs. Highly recommend!</Text>< Pics>

Fantastic team! I’ve worked with Team Thomas on two different occasions and both times They have not only gotten me the best deal and closed successfully but have also been extremely professional, knowledgable and very responsive.  Each time they have been transparent and honest, never a surprise, never any hidden fees and no ulterior motives - just straight forward and good hearted people to work with who get the job done.  While I always like to shop around for best deals, Brady, Liz and the rest of the team will continue to remain my go to mortgage broker in California.<//text>

Brady is a fantastic loan agent.  He is clear, understandable, responsive and responsible in his communication and in his work.  He offered ideas to help us get the best refinance loan available for us and offered support to make that happen.  His support team efficiently and skillfully guided us through the necessary paperwork and helped keep us on track. I highly recommend working with Brady.</review>

My wife and I have worked with Brady and his team at La Salle a number of times, for both refi and home purchase. The last one, was complex - we were selling and buying at the same time - add additional challenges due to Covid and it took a real pro to lead the team. Brady did just that. We wouldn't be in our new home without his creative approach and hard work. Highly recommend!<//Review>

The have excellent customer service. They response promptly, they explain the different loan options and process clearly and concisely.< /Review>

Brady and his team were phenomenal in helping us get into our dream home.  We'd worked with several large, institutional lenders  with whom we'd gone through weeks of back and forth to get pre-approved.  We found the home we wanted, and our realtor strongly encouraged us to work with Brady rather than a big bank, since her had been so responsive and reliable in her prior sales with him.

Even though our offer was due just 3 days after being connected with Brady, he and his team HUSTLED to get us preapproved in time.  He knew the selling agent as well, and helped reassure all parties that we'd be solid buyers.  With their support, we made our offer, got it accepted, and they walked us through the whole process (taking the time to answer a lot of our questions as first time homebuyers) just as our realtor had hoped.  We were kept up to date regarding what to expect, and we closed on our dream home before we knew it.  We couldn't be happier with or more grateful for our experience with Brady and his team.</review>

<review>Highly recommend Brady and Team Thomas!  My partner and I worked with them for our loan for our first home.  Brady and his team made a stressful and overwhelming process much easier to navigate by giving logical and concise advice as well as preparing us for next steps in each part of the process.  Despite the many complications that are currently added to the home buying and loan process due to COVID and remote work, they worked diligently to make sure we got what we needed.

We are so thankful for all of the detailed work the professionals at Team Thomas did on our behalf to keep the process moving and find the best financial option for us!<//review><Gmap_id>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95< /Gmap_id><Rating>5<//Rating><user_id>112119863058343054181< /user_id>< pictures>

<Text>Brady and Elizabeth we’re so helpful all throughout the process. Totally recommend them!

I was sceptical of mortgage brokers at the beginning, because I thought it’d be more expensive. But the bank paid for all their costs. Also, he was able to get us around 1% lower interest rate than anyone else! (We checked other mortgage brokers and online services).

Our process was tedious for several reasons but the whole team was super attentive and surprisingly fast (usually reply to any email in less than 2h, If not right away)

Thanks all!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<text>Brady is highly communicative and responsive. His team is great to work with as well.

We relied pretty heavily on his knowledge, as we were first time home buyers.

He got us a great rate, too.

Thanks, Brady and Team Thomas!</text>< pics>

Brady and his team especially Elizabeth, were so incredibly helpful throughout the whole pre-approval, mortgage application, and closing process.  We are first-time home buyers and Brady's team took extra care to walk us through each step and worked very hard to make the process as smooth as possible.  Because our experience was so great and the rates so competitive, we have already referred several friends to his services.</Text>

< Review>
My wife and I recently bought our first home in Oakland, and we feel so lucky to have had Brady Thomas as our loan officer. After speaking with a number of brokers and lenders, it was clear that Brady was the perfect fit for our financial situation. Buying our first home could be a stressful process, but his team was there for us every step of the way and made it as easy as possible. I'll definitely recommend him to anyone I know looking to buy a home - nothing but positive feedback from us.</Review>

My partner and I highly recommend Brady Thomas and his team. They helped us navigate the mortgage process as first-time home buyers, and we are very pleased with the outcome. All of our interactions with Brady and his team were positive. They provided clear instructions at each step of the process, and were available when we had questions or issues. They clearly know what they are doing, and we trust them!<//Review>

Brady and his team were simply the best. We have used them to get both the financing when purchasing our new home, and again 6 months later when Covid caused interest rates to drop to unimaginable levels. Both times, Brady and the people he's assembled went above and beyond in finding us options, explaining how we could proceed, and making it very clear and easy how to systematically go about something that is very hard to understand. the entire time I felt completely cared and looked-out for, and i could not be happier with the process or result. Do yourself a favor and hire Brady Thomas today.</review>

<rate>5< /rate><Review>I barely squeaked in on time and closed on a condo the day before many county offices shut down for Shelter in Place. I am very grateful to have had Team Thomas on my side. They were totally on it, which made the close a success and prevented me from being in some weird real estate limbo right now.

I am a first time home buyer and had an aggressive ~2 week close schedule.  I contacted a total of three mortgage lenders. Team Thomas stood out in their thoroughness, willingness to explain, and, through my interactions with them, a sense that I was working with genuinely good people.

This team works hard! When I made my offer, Team Thomas was traveling for Brady's wedding. His team  even took calls en route to the ceremony.  (Fortunately, it seems Brady took some time off to attend his own wedding.)

I am very glad my real estate agent recommended Brady. I had a great experience working with him, Lindsey, and Elizabeth. I highly recommend!<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

We reached out to Brady because our initial lender could not process our loan quickly enough. We truly wanted to work with our trusted bank but Brady and his  team proved to be much more capable of supporting our home lending needs.

Brady and his team are outstanding professionals. They knew that we were first time home buyers and patiently educated and explained all that we needed to know about the home lending process from start to finish. We felt like we were all part of a team working toward the same goal with both our realtor and Brady’s team.

Starting from our very first phone call with Brady, we were immediately put at ease. We had to get pre-qualified very quickly in order to submit an offer in time. Brady turned that pre-qualification around in just one business day. From there, he explained to us the lending process, the types of information we would need to be ready to provide, and the various contingencies and risks we should know about. He also gave us an interest rate and estimated closing cost calculator which enabled us to run numbers quickly and make the right data-informed decisions.

Once we started the process with Brady, he looped in his team member Elizabeth who worked closely with us to collect and review all of our documents — and there were so many! Both Elizabeth and Brady were quick and efficient in letting us know what we needed to provide, by when, and at what level detail, etc. Not once did we have to call in for status updates. They kept us informed of any major issues and provided regular updates along the way, which was so critical for us, given the stress of buying a home.

Beyond working hard for us behind the scenes and being reliable and communicative, Brady and his team were very kind and compassionate. They knew this process was both emotional and time consuming, so they did everything to make the process as clear and as easy on us as possible, often jumping on the phone with us to talk us through any of our concerns. The process and experience working with Brady and his team was absolutely seamless.

Finally, when always said and done, Brady and his team offered to donate $250 to our favorite charity. They don’t just help their clients process one of the most important financial decisions in their lives, they give back to their community too.

We would 100% recommend Brady’s services to our friends and family and would work with him and his team again.< /Text><Date>1600751428542< /Date><UserId.>114071559536875072887<//UserId.></record>

Brady and his team are awesome and very attentive to their clients needs.  I reached out to them about refinancing my home and it was a very smooth and quick process.  They let me know what the next steps are, they give me a very competitive rate and made sure that I was engaged in the process.  Refinancing usually takes a lot of time and can be very stressful but La Salle mortgage made it a very pleasant experience.</Review>

Echoing literally every single review on here, Brady Thomas, Elizabeth Bernal, and their incredible team behind the scenes do truly go above and beyond to create easy, efficient, and really valuable lending experiences for their clients. For me, what could have been an intimating process, they made quite fun and continually ensured that I would always know what to expect next. Just as importantly, Brady and team managed to help me lock incredible rates during what seems like uncertain times. Particularly in my case, this team really saved the day and made this purchase happen with best-in-class appraisers and their tight network of realtors and lenders -- they managed to help me close on my first house way ahead in our timeline.  I highly recommend Team Thomas to any first time home buyer who might be looking for competitive rates and a team of incredible humans who will fight for you.<//review>

Brady Thomas is the best there is. If you're a first time home buyer, you can feel confident that you are in great care with Brady. There is no question too small , he wants to make sure you feel comfortable every step of the process. Brady and his team worked diligently to make sure that my loan closed as quickly as possible and made sure to communicate with me the whole time, clearly and promptly.

He's incredibly knowledgeable and I can't recommend him enough. I would say without a doubt, if you're a first time home buyer (or an experienced home buyer), look no further than Brady Thomas and team!< /Text>

<Review>Team Thomas got me into my house in exactly 30 days from the first email to getting the key.
They took care of the most minute detail and knew my hurdles way before they showed up, allowing me to clear and barrier in advance.
Their level of professionalism and integrity is top notch. My purchase was complicated and i did not have the best credit and within 10 days they helped me get my credit way up, allowing me to get a great rate and a lower payment than I estimated or even dreamed of.
I am going to call on them for my refi and if i ever sell & buy again, Team Thomas is getting my business. To top it all off, they donated $250 to my favorite non-profit that is committed to reducing gun violence in Oakland.

< review>
This is the 2nd time we have worked with Brady and his team. This time it was to refinance our mortgage and Brady was again able to break down the choppy waters of the finance world into crystal clear language. Everyone in his office was prompt in their replies and helpful in every way. This is all the more impressive considering it was in the middle of the springtime covid shutdown. We have effusively recommended them in the past and will continue to do so in the future.<//review>

The whole team was incredible to work with throughout our entire loan process purchasing our first home in Berkeley. Everyone on their team was so incredibly helpful and straightforward with us and were always willing to help us understand every step of the process. I can't recommend this group enough! Thanks to Brady and the entire team for making our buying process painless!</text>

I have worked with Brady and his team twice now, and they are thorough, very knowledgeable and not shy to give you the right advice, even if it may mean that they don't get business out of it.

They are proactive in finding the best solution for their clients, and have always over delivered on their promises. Will recommend them to all homebuyers, whether buying a new home or refinancing.</review>

Brady Thomas and "Team Brady" recently guided us smoothly through a successful house closing (bay area).  All members of the team were always easily available, clear and constructive in how best  to complete all of the required documentation,  and pro-active in all aspects of a process that can
be stressful.  Their efforts/cheerful demeanor minimized the stress.< /text>

Brady and his team are the best! After months of bureaucratic red tape from BoA (who was risking losing our mortgage in the process) Brady and team had us locked in at a great rate in 1 week and closed escrow in exactly 30 days after our first conversation (not application)! They keep you informed and answer questions in terms you can understand. Cannot recommend more.</text>

Brady Thomas and his team were very helpful and responsive. They worked hard to get us the best deal and were patient in answering our questions and giving us information. They gave helpful advice where they could and made the process very pleasant. My only change to the process might have been a phone call or a few less emails as it started to get a bit difficult to track all of the information in long threads especially at the beginning where we didn't know a lot about all of the information we were looking at. But definitely a good and friendly experience and made us feel like we were getting good information and a good rate for our mortgage.<//text>

We recently purchased our first house in the Bay Area -- a daunting task as many of you know!  Brady was one of the mortgage brokers recommended to us by our real estate agent.  After chatting with all of the recommendations, we chose to go with Brady.

The real estate market in the Bay Area is unlike anywhere else in the world.  It's so incredibly hard to get a bid accepted when you are competing with all cash offers.  Brady's team offers extremely quick closing which can give you a leg up on other offers.

After you're in contract, there are many ways the deal can fall through.  In our case, we had an issue with our appraisal.  Bay Area homes routinely sell for far over asking, but our appraiser only considered list price.  Here is where working with someone who is familiar with the local market made the difference between getting the house (really, our dream house) and having to back out of the contract.  Brady worked on our behalf to contest and get a new independent appraisal -- which came in at contract price (over 100k difference).  His team also advocated for us to get closing fees and expenses down saving us over 2,000 dollars.

Brady and his team are also extremely communicative.  He answers his phone, will explain any situation frankly with offered solutions, and happily answers naive questions.  I'd happily return in the future if we decide to purchase another property or refinance, without a doubt.< /Text>

As a first time home buyer, I did not know what to expect with the loan approval process and only heard how invasive and uncomfortable it would be. However, after working with Brady and team it was not nearly as rough as I was expecting. I 100% credit this to Brady and his team. They would send detailed emails about: 1) what to expect, 2) patiently explained and walked me through the process, and 3) provided very clear instructions what I needed to provide and when.

On top of all that, he secured a great rate for me and I can't recommend Brady and his team highly enough. Thank you again for making the process smooth and stress free!</Review>

Just finished out third round. Still love these guys - Will keep up our last review as well.

Our Second time working with Brady and Crew. I wish I could thank everyone individually.. I know it took multiple people to make both purchasing and refinancing our Home such a positive experience.. but a review can only express so much... Great commutation. Super trustworthy advice. Understands the Bay and breaks down the market in a really logical way.  Can’t recommend highly enough.</Text>

<UserId.>103538171948963399885<//UserId.><Review>Brady was very helpful in securing the mortgage for our new home. He was very good about covering all of the bases so that no last minute snag would cause undue stress. I would give five stars, but I just do not do that without over the top impossibly unrealistic service that just so rarely happens in any aspect of life. That said, Brady and his team were great and I am very grateful for their hard work.<//Review>< name>

<Text>Brady, Lindsey, and Team Thomas couldn't have done a better job in getting us funded for our first property purchase.  As a first-timer, it's hard to appreciate how important a good mortgage lender is until you are in the thick of the process.  Bottom line: it's critical.  Having an organized and responsive lender with a great reputation gives you the confidence to make offers with competitive terms.  Brady also goes out of his way to help you understand your options and turns a pre-approval letter in very short notice.   After our offer was accepted, Team Thomas got all the paperwork in line and was diligent in obtaining what they needed from us to get us to close on time.  It was surprisingly painless.  Thanks again team and we will be back one day!< /Text><GmapID>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95</GmapID><rate>5<//rate>< Pictures>

< review>
Team Thomas was very helpful, friendly and responsive during our mortgage process. They helped us early on to get all of our stuff together and get pre-approved so that we had a really strong offer on our house. They walked us through the approval and title process, acted as the go-between with the bank and title company so we only had to provide our information to one person, and kept in close contact with us when our closing date was delayed for a day because the bank didn't fund in time.
Thank you, we are so excited to move into our new house!</review>

Knowledgable, Organized, and Works for you

Brady and his team is fantastic!  You can trust him in working to get things done correctly and on time.

He has helped my family with two loans now. Both times, from the start to end of the loan process, we felt we were in good hands. He is a good communicator in relaying the important and realistic situations when it needs to be said.

You can have full trust in him in finding you a good loan rate in your scenario< /review>

<review>Brady and Team Thomas are a fantastic group to work with when it comes to getting a mortgage. They were great at walking us through each step, while ensuring that we fully understood our options throughout. We were consistently reminded of exactly what we needed to get done, but at no point did it feel pushy only helpful.

We highly recommend Brady and his team for any mortgage you are looking for. We had an early consultation to determine the best fit for us, and they did all of the heavy lifting. Overall, it was a great experience!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

At every step in the home loan process, Brady and Team Thomas rapidly responded to all our questions and concerns and handled every detail seamlessly.  It was the very definition of "being in good hands".  If you're looking for trusted professionals to expertly handle the largest purchase in your life, Lasalle should be your next call.</review>

Brady and his team were the consummate professionals. He was able to anticipate what was needed to get the loan closed and willing to take his time to discuss me as a homebuyer with the seller's agent. Brady also handled a quick turnaround on escrow and delivered on time. I will definitely be using Brady again on my next home purchase.</text>

We could count on him not only for a great interest rate but also a quick and helpful response.

Brady and Team Thomas really came through for us in a very quick turnaround that enabled us to get the house we wanted.  From qualifying to securing the loan, Brady and his team made it easy for us to do what we had feared wasn't possible.  We saw the house on a Sunday and by Thursday were able to make the winning offer; we then closed in record time.  Brady was personally available to us throughout the process and his team was on top of the many details.  Thanks so much Brady and crew!  Linda and Regina</text>

Brady is not only so incredibly knowledgeable about the mortgage industry, but also very thorough in explaining the process and how everything works, incredibly kind, patient, and is always looking out for you! We were working with a big bank initially and they failed to inform us on how the process works, the one time closing costs, the PMI, and they did not have a sense of urgency like Brady and his team does. Brady also worked hard to get us the lowest rate possible! No point in even thinking about working with anyone else other than Brady and his team!<//text>

<time>1540763408818</time><rating>5</rating><Review>I have been involved with many real estate loan transactions over the last 40 years but I have never experienced the level of professionalism, attention to detail, and personal attention Team Thomas provided during the recent purchase of our new home. Our financial situation is unusual and I had been concerned about how we would be able to qualify for the home we wanted, but Brady's succinct and thorough explanation of his strategy for us completely cleared up my worries. Every step of the process was explained and every person from Brady's team was extremely knowledgeable and always pleasant to deal with. Our questions were answered immediately and all explanations were clear and concise, which can be a feat when dealing with complex financial transactions. Not only did Brady's team handle our transaction flawlessly, they also recently took care of our daughter and son-in-law for their very first home purchase, and their experience with Team Thomas was equally commendable. We will also be steering our son Brady's way to start the process of pre-qualification for his future first home.

We absolutely recommend Brady and Team Thomas for your mortgage needs!</Review>< pictures>

Brady and his team were fantastic in getting our loan approved quickly.
Advising us to get pre underwritten allowed to close in 15 days, eliminating a lot of stress for us.
Thanks again for the great experience!<//review>

<Text>Team Thomas has now helped me secure three loans for mutli-family properties.  Delivering excellent service once can be attributed to luck, but three times can only be explained by true skill.  Each time, his team was exceedingly proactive, organized and aggressive in securing financing - making sure we were protected throughout the overall process.  There are very few financial services firms I would personally recommend without hesitation - Team Thomas is one.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95</Gmap_id></record>

Second time working with Brady and his team. Very patient , informative and generally easy to work with. I had tried other brokers and always felt like my questions or requests were burdensome but never felt that way with Brady or Elizebeth (who we worked directly with this time around) if I have financial needs in the future I will use them in a heartbeat.</review>

<text>Brady and his team were fantastic to work with throughout our entire home buying process. He was able to get us pre-approved quickly and when it came time to close on a loan in a tight timeframe, once again his team came through with a great rate and made sure we followed up on all of the information needed. Highly recommend Brady Thomas to any prospective East Bay resident.<//text>< Rating>

All communication with Brady and his team are clear and directive that help me to understand the process and prepare the document as needed.  They are local and has good reputation that seller agent trust and perfer to work with them so we are able to get the house with this competitive market. Thanks, Team Thomas!<//text>

<Review>Brady and his team were fast, professional and extremely helpful during our mortgage process. They helped us through every step of the application process and used all digital communications whenever possible, which was a huge time saver.  And on top of that, after our closing his team made a donation to our favorite charity. It’s great that his team demonstrates commitment to both customers and the community. You’ll be in good hands with LaSalle and Team Thomas.</Review></record></dataset><record>

As first time homebuyers, Brady made what would normally be an extremely difficult process seem easy. He and his team were extremely knowledgeable and responsive to us. Whether we texted, emailed or called, Brady always answered our every question and provided us the guidance and support we needed.

From Joey to Elizabeth to the head guy Brady, #teamthomas was amazing to work with. I would recommend anyone looking to get a home loan to work with these folks. Options aren't hidden from you. You are not judged based on your financial situation. Their organization and timelines are explicit and user friendly.

Because people like lists...
1) Closed my loan early and got me a stellar rate!
2) They donate money in your name to your favorite charity after close.
3) They can explain everything in a clear way, EVEN IF YOU REPLY WITH MORE QUESTIONS THERE-BY CREATING A CRAZY LONG EMAIL CHAIN... sorry Elizabeth.
4) Friendly good people who support each other, I started with Joey and 3 people down the road felt cared for by everyone I talked to.

Thanks LaSalle!<//review>

Our real estate agent recommended Brady and his team in order to get a same day pre-approval so we could make a bid the following day. Brady was able to get us the pre-approval in a matter of hours. Also with Team Thomas, we were able to submit an aggressive bid with a short closing time-frame. Brady and his team are fast and responsive and worked hard to achieve the short closing period we promised the seller. We had so many questions during the process. It was really great to have their expertise as a resource. We had some difficulties in our home closing process but Brady, Lindsey, and the team were patient and professional. We are very grateful!</Text>

<review>We just closed escrow on our house and worked with Brady Thomas and LaSalle on our loan. There were a couple of unique circumstances for us and others lenders had made suggestions we were not happy with. Brady was creative and got us a perfect loan for our situation. He and Lindsey were so prompt with every single document and explained when necessary. We would absolutely work with them again. - David -

APRIL 2020 UPDATE

Once again, we had a great experience with Brady and his team. A year-and-a-half ago they helped us get the right loan for our circumstances when we purchased our new home before we sold our old home. This time, we refinanced the house after making significant improvements to it. They were outstanding again working with me to get the perfect loan, even canceling a loan with one lender when the interest rates dropped sufficiently that it was worth making the jump. His team was great always responding quickly even under the challenging COVID-19 circumstances. When the closing costs ended up adding up to slightly higher than his estimate, he refunded the overage. They were all great and I would happily recommend them to anyone or use them again in the future.<//review><Time>1588373570022< /Time><GmapID>0x808f879aa0c7815f:0x1399858b7c99ea95</GmapID>< Pictures>

We worked with Brady and his team to buy our first home and couldn't have been happier with the experience! They kept in close touch every step of the way, and always had time to make sure we understood what can be a pretty complicated process. Even our real estate agent was wowed by the extreme care Brady took to make sure everything went smoothly. In this competitive housing market it's so important to work with the right lender. We'd definitely recommend Brady and LaSalle to anyone!<//text>

All mortgage lenders and brokers are governed by the same guidelines and regulations. However, not all Mortgage lenders and brokers are created equal. The KEY to a GREAT broker, as opposed to an average or good broker,  is someone who knows the guidelines well, AND someone who knows how to work within the guidelines and make the guidelines work for the particular circumstances and needs of each individual client. That is what you have in Brady Thomas.

I had a first and second mortgage on investment property I own in the San Francisco Bay Area. The first mortgage had a fixed affordable rate.  My first mortgage was owned by my bank, Wells Fargo.  The second mortgage was an adjustable, which had been bought by RPM several years ago. For a period of time, the payments on the second were affordable, due to government imposed low interest rates. Then the monthly payment on the second mortgage trippled due, in part, to increased interest rates, and due, in other part, to the nature of adjustable loans.  Thereafter, making the monthly payments became a nightmare. The rental income no longer paid for the two mortgages combined. I had to come up with the difference out of pocket.  That was eating up my savings. I was frightened that I would lose the property.

I spoke to a few other lenders, including mortgage specialists who worked at Wells Fargo. None were able to help. Then I was introduced to Brady Thomas through my property manager. Brady was a God Send. Brady was able to do what none of the prior lenders could do. He was able to combine my first and second mortgages into one new loan at a low fixed rate.  I now pay close to $1,000 less per month on mortgage payments.

The whole refinance process, from start to finish, took about 2 months. Throughout the process, Brady’s performance was flawless. If an obstacle arose, Brady would find a creative way to get through each and every obstacle.  He kept his promise and he delivered. He got me out of my loan with RPM.   He made it work. I am grateful.<//review>

I  highly recommend the loan agent Brady Thomas and the entire TeamThomas at LaSalle Mortgage. The entire loan process was handled with professionalism and care. Brady and the entire team at LaSalle Mortgage were always available and thoughtfully answered any questions or concerns I had along the way. As a first time home buyer, I could not have asked for any better service from a mortgage company. I look forward to working with all the wonderful people at LaSalle again some day.
They are the BEST!

< review>
Brady Thomas and his team made our dream of becoming homeowners in Oakland a reality in the fall of 2018 and more recently, he helped us refinance our home with a much lower interest rate, which will save us tons of money every month. He made himself available at all times, his work ethic is impeccable, he is efficient and proactive . I would highly recommend working with him, particularly in a competitive market like the Bay Area where you need a knowledgeable, trusted, and determined loan officer to help refinance your home.</review>

<time>1563832092036</time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Dear Mr. Brady Thomas,

Many thanks to LaSalle Financial and the exceptional service provided by “Team Thomas”, during our loan refinancing.  You gave us a 40-day completion window and met that commitment without a hitch. The loan process at LaSalle Financial is very organized and the team removes most of the workload from the client.   In my experience obtaining more than 10 real estate loans on various properties, your team and process in the BEST that I’ve ever experienced.  I would love to recommend LaSalle Financial to anyone who needs a loan in the future.

Sincerely,
Charles O’Quinn< /Text>< pictures>

Brady and his team went above and beyond to make sure we got the loan on our house. We're first time home buyers and Brady made the process super easy. He talked us through every step and made sure that we understood how everything worked.  We've tried to buy a house the past three years using different lenders snd getting pre-approved, and this was the first time we felt empowered to make our dream come true. Within 30 days of being pre-approved with Brady we were getting the keys to our new house.

Tips:
√ Brady answers the phone when you call.
√ They have a great relationship with the underwriter.
√ They've been trusted to fund thousands loans in Oakland, CA
√ Brady comes from a family in the Mortgage Industry, vast knowledge.
√ They offer "TBD" Approval, allowing you to close in 14 days (like us!)

Don't hesitate, this will be the best decision you've made in your home buying journey. Cheers, Brady!< /Text>

<text>Brady was extremely helpful in pricing many different loan scenarios. He was extremely thorough, responsive and creative. He was very patient as our search for a home took many months, and different configurations, and I could always shoot him a quick e-mail asking for a run down of different scenarios as they came up.

<text>Anyone who needs to carpet cleaning in their home from this place, please take my advise that you'll be sorry you did. the service man name is Jim middle age man, who quote me for $180 for four bedroom home. My carpets were clean, not dirty, as I steam clean weekly for my dogs for their health.
Also, backyard is covered with artificial grass to prevent dirt's from outside. so, my floor was not heavy dirty, and I vacuumed entire floors before he came to steam cleaning my carpets,  every time when I called to confirm appointment, he said he's be at 11:-12 PM. and he said he dose not AM hours.  He'd giving me different ph. number to reach him. but he doesn't answer. He kept me late I can't call Stanly which they're honest with the charges, and they wouldn't make me wait.

On a Appointment day, he kept being late hour by hour, after three (3) hrs. late, came  to clean carpets he charged me over $611.00. Although, I asked him the price with possible Pet Oder treat, he said it would be $180. and I gave him the location, but then he said he'd charge me extra for distance. If so, why he'd on my City advertisement? I would never seek fir business from Roseville since I live in south from Sacrament area.
The point is I would never seek for their business if I knew they're big scammers! Lookout before having their service.  Call Stanly Carpet who's professional people. (Also, he cleaned only 40 minutes with talking included), so he didn't even worked on my carpet for job that he promised.)</text><pictures>None</pictures>< response>

Stay away. Advertised $99 for 700 sq feet. I had 870 dq feet so obviously I knew it would be more than $99. Jim gets to the house, looks around then tells me his scam. Stairs are extra, this spot is extra, thats extra, etc. He then says $360. I laughed at him and said way to expensive, no thanks. His response was rhe rudest possible, as he asked what my budget is. Look, I dont have a budget, its more like what can you do them for and make a prodit without growing me. I told him $250 max which was still way to much. He countered at $280. Needing them done bc company coming over i agreed. He was gone 45 mins later. Not happy and will not use again. Last company I used (which I was very happy with but lost their contact and name) did a great job, exact same areas for $125. Jim is a nice guy, total salesman type, and I get they are in it to make money, but I will not ever use them again</Text>

I contacted Keep it Clean because my rugs were in need of some deep cleaning. Jim arrived on time and was extremely professional. I was amazed when he took out a uv light and showed me a pet stains that were previously there. He cleaned the carpets to perfection and I know that now I will be using their services from now on.</text>

<text>I never leave reviews regardless of good or bad but Jim is fantastic. Best cleaned carpets I’ve Uber experienced and I have many experiences over the years with many different companies. This was the best carpet cleaning I’ve ever known. 25 year old house and he made them look like new. He’s my guy from now on!  Nothing negative whatsoever and I’m pretty critical as a matter of practice.<//text>< pictures>

They were awesome!!! I was able to book them for a move out cleaning and have a clear estimate that was affordable. But what blew me away was the professionalism, the care and consideration, and the promptness of this service team. They were on time, worked diligently and went above and beyond to make sure that the house was clean! 1645 sq. Foot house clean in just 2.5 hours!!</Review>

<text>We have tried another place before that I will not mention. Jimmy was great. True to their ad with same day service. He was so fast and got ALL the pet stains out. I will definitely use his service again! The ad was for $99, but I have a large home and understandably, it was $601 with carpet and upholstery. Less for carpet alone.< /text>< UserId.>

We had a great experience with Jim, who did an amazing job cleaning both our tile and carpet.  We have a pet and Jim showed us where accidents had happened that we were not aware of and cleaned it all up.  He didn't try to oversell us on more than we needed either.  He is a friendly person and was great to work with!  Our floors look awesome!</review>

Easy to schedule with updates on their arrival.  So there was never a concern that they were going to show and show up within the the two time block they gave me. I was given a rough quote over the phone which  was very reasonable and it stayed the same once they arrived. The work was excellent and  all my dog (s) pee stains are gone leaving a very pleasant smell. I’ll be using them again without a doubt.

Can’t go wrong with this company.

You were great!  We asked for same day appointment and you made it happen. I personally did not see the carpet before and after it was cleaned, but I was told by the listing agent that our client loved the service and was very happy.  We will be calling you again.  Thank you!<//review>

Jim was awesome and very personable. They serviced the move out from my apartment . Small rug repair (kitty 😿😾 scratching boo boo) and deep steam cleaning. The deodorizer made the apartment smell amazing. The blue light did reveal pet accidents unknown to me. Feel confident in their professionalism and knowledge. I did receive my entire security deposit back! Thank you Keep It CLean.☺🐕👍👍</Text>

They did an AMAZING job. When i called for an appointment I was greeted by a very polite young man who was prompt and professional. Two techs, Jim and Matthew, came out to my house and even though Matthew was training he already seemed like a pro! Jim explained everything very thoroughly and they did a wonderful job! So glad I got the pet deodorizer as we just got a new not-housebroken pet. Will definitely have them back come my next carpet cleaning!</Review>

<review>I called Keep It Clean to inquire about carpet cleaning, as we recently got a new puppy and had lots of "potty accidents" over the past couple of months.  Now that she's trained, our poor carpets needed some serious attention!  I was able to get an appointment for the very next day.  Jim was courteous and worked efficiently.  He sprayed a pretreatment on the carpet before steam cleaning, then an enzyme treatment to further help with the doggie spots.  My carpet, though quite old, looks great again and even better, the house smells good!  I also like their easy scheduling, and text message notifications for my appointment confirmation, and to let me know when Jom was on his way.  Thanks!!!!!</review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

Had our carpets cleaned, our tile cleaned and our couches cleaned, all on separate visits over the past 2 years, and we were very happy with all the results. Removed wine stains from our carpet that had been there for a couple years. Our grout lightened up to it's original color, which we had no idea it actually was. Will continue to use Keep it Clean going forward.< /Text>

<Text>These guys are absolutely stellar. Came same-day as the request for floor cleaning and removed the smell from pet mess in the carpet. Could not have asked for a better service, and by a very friendly staff. If you're looking for someone, don't look any further - They're worth it.</Text>< pictures>

BEWARE!!!  Absolutely disreputable company! Charged extra for "special soap" and the carpet was worse than before they started. But the worst part was the damage to my stairs from their hose! They took NO RESPONSIBILITY for the shoddy work, nor the damages! BEWARE!!</text>

This is a small place that has the best deals in small pet cages that I've been able to find. They have them in different sizes and colors, I was very impressed 4 🌟 for sure 👍they also sale birds, 🐔 chicken, 🐓 Roosters and some reptiles. I recommend you stop by and see if they have what you might be looking for.<//Review>

< review>
Came to get a mini rooster for my flock and some Tabita. They had a variety of chickens and birds. I had bought one about 6 months ago. The chicken has been healthy and lays tons of eggs ! Great local pet store. They can also get any animal you request.<//review>

After having problems with three other places in one day (odd circumstances), I stopped in here randomly to be get a smog check done. They were a bit more expensive than some places but very fast and efficient given the drop in of my visit. Small, older waiting area, but sufficed as I wasn't there long.</Review>

Small place incredible service.. Ethan is extremely well priced and knowledgeable and works HANDS ON his customers cars.  Very honest n fast service.  Replaced a windshield once on my SUV and that too was far less in cost thrn other places.   And there is a HAND WASHED CAR SERVICE TOO<//Review>

The cheapest and best car wash I have discovered in Bay Area. Inside + Outside hand car wash and vacuum for only $15! And full wash with carpet clean only $24. I get it fully cleaned once every 6-7months so I guess its worth it.<//Text>

Never seen anybody here, most of the cars are here for the car wash. I  guess they take on some customers who stray away from the car wash line. Not sure if I would trust my pampered vehicle here, but if you are looking for a cost-efficient mechanic, this would be the place.</Review>

I just had my car washed here and although the guy who said everything was done, it did not look like they vacuumed.  I was looking the whole time and I did not see them vacuum.  If they did vacuum, they did a terrible job as there was still stuff all over my floor.   I won't be back.  For 2 dollars more I can go to this other car wash I know and they will  wipe the inside with a special cleaner.  They will also vacuum and do it well.<//Text>

<Review>Pupusas were really good! Modest little place with an outdated juke box, but I came for the food, not the music, amirite? Lol

I ordered one with chicharon y frijoles, and the other was chorizo con queso. Would definitely come back!< /Review></record>

Had the California Omelet and all of the veges tasted so fresh! They're updating their menu to add more authentic Mexican food and will be making a wall menu with pictures to help.</Review>

We have stopped here on our way to Sequoia National Park. The place has surprisingly rich menu. We have tried the hot sandwiches and some kids food. All very tasty, prepared quickly and the lady serving us was very nice. I would certainly recommend this place :)</Text>

Tasty food and good service. Late afternoon was lightly busy, nice. Oldies music playing on the radio and each booth has a silly book to read quickly while you wait. The Mexican burger was very good. The hamburger patty was thick, like handmade! Everything served was as hoped and hit the spot for a quick stop from driving. Nice, quaint diner. We'll keep it in mind next time we pass through.

Edit: This was the best burger we've tasted in a while. Really hit the spot.</review>

We just ate here. Very clean, great burgers and club sandwiches. Not a friendly waitress but she was cleaning and staying busy.  The gentleman who was cleaning was smiling and had a great hello. Nice place! Will go back.<//text>

I love this place, AND I added a lengthy review some time ago. But it would be mute to do a review now that I've been informed that it has  been permanently closed.
TO BAD😞😭!!
My wife & I LOOKED forward to going back. They should have had a "go-fund-me"account. I would have helped.< /text>

We were in the middle of nowhere looking for lunch.  Stop here if you're in the same situation.  Serves breakfast all day, I think, but I had a great lunch of an open faced sliced beef sandwich.<//text>

I live here in Mojave, and I've been looking for a good restaurant to eat, relax, and escape the heat. They serve good, old fashioned food at a very reasonable price the service is friendly and helpful. My server this morning wss Vianey. Every time I come here, I've been satisfied. I definitely recommend this Cafe, to locals, and travelers.</Text>

This place isn't bad, but the prices are a bit high, the food is just average. Good service though. :-)<//Review>

They have REALLY good burgers.
The patty's seem freshly (hand) made... We went there for dinner one time since it opened and I've been craving a burger from Mojave Cafe ever since. I will definitely go again soon... Sorry I didn't think to take photos at the time.
This Cafe is located on Sierra Hwy in junction from the 14fwy and the 58fwy. Mojave, CA. They have a variety of menu options, including breakfast. They sell beer, and have wifi for customers convenience.</text>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Wonderful customer service from Derek Cornell. I was looking at two vehicles online, requested information and he responded quickly and efficiently. Went above and beyond to explain details and answered all questions I had. Saw me the very next day in store and had both vehicles ready to show. He’s extremely knowledgeable in his area and knew all aspects of both vehicles. From start to finish, it was a easy, smooth purchase. Will be recommending his service to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle online or in store. All the staff was helpful and made my first car purchase a memorable one.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

The dealership is clean, spacious and comfortable. We ended up loving the car & decides to pull the trigger. The staff is very easy to deal with and professional. Our sales person is so helpful, and we like that he is not pushy. I would say that me and my husband have an excellent experience overall.</text>

< Review>
I just bought a new car here and the experience went great. I went to 4 other dealerships before this one and all of them were horrible. Cory, the sales manager, and Manny, the financer both were fantastic. Very friendly and helpful. Neither of them were pushy, tried to get me to stay, or tried changing numbers at the end. I would definitely recommend going here for a stress free car buying experience.< /Review>

I’ve always been a mossy fan and Nissan has been in the family since I was born. But Corey brought out my own love and appreciation for the company and brand. To see the effort someone will go through not for a sale but for my comfort and experience shows me that this is a place I can trust. Corey at Mossy Nissan In El Cajon is doing it right and made buying my first car an amazing experience.</review>< userid>

Derek and later Joe helped me get into my new car with a much lower interest rate than expected and then delivered it to my work. The process was relatively quick and easy and I never had to miss any time from my busy work schedule.</Review>

<review>Called to schedule an appointment and the gentleman told me no problem and had me in a couple hours later. This being my first Nissan I had a question regarding oil maintenance and the gentleman on the phone was very confused about what I was asking so I told him not to worry about it and I’d follow up when I showed up.
Showed up for my appointment and the gentleman taking care of me went on and on about how he had 25 other cars and they were closing at 4 and he would “do what he could, no promises” I said ok not a problem…..he seemed very stressed out because as he continued with whatever computer work he was doing he continued to tell me how backed up they were and he would do what he could. I said no worries, at the end of the day we can just reschedule right? He said we could but he would do his best, again…..no promises.
Just kept thinking why would I be scheduled so quickly if this guy was this backed up? Wondered how the appointments are scheduled and if they’re communicating effectively with each other.
As I walked out I remembered my service question so I asked the gentleman my question and he gave me a very quick response. I said ok only reason I’m asking is because I saw on the Nissan website this info here, without looking at what I was showing him he said no it’s this. I said ok well maybe you should talk to the big boys upstairs because others may not have the luxury of talking to you and could possibly damage their vehicles going off what Nissan recommends.
My service was done in about an hour or so, which made me wonder what all the hooplah was about being so backed up.
Next time around I may try the National city location to see if I fare a little better. Kind of felt like a bit of a bother and when dealing with questions the guy was a little condescending.< /review>< Resp>

Manny Jurado (Sales Manager), Gabe Sellers (Product Consultant) and Sarah Tapia (Service Advisor), I can't thank them enough. I am excited with my new purchase and I am pleased on how well these three individuals take care of me and my cars needs. I've had my share of bad experiences and that has all been over ruled with the welcoming service Sarah provides me, the patience and understanding Gabe Sellers provided me in sales (I'm not the easiest to work with), and the environment full of laughter Manny provided when I signed my documents. I highly recommend Gabe when looking for a new car, Manny for the best deals on warranties and Sarah for any return trip needed for servicing your Nissan.< /text>

I was promised a refund for this "maintenance" package. I have called several times and left message still not respond. Today I called and was hung up on. Shame on you Mossy Nissan for these deplorable, dishonest practices of ripping off veterans.

Veterans beware! I purchased a vehicle from here back in January. At purchase a fast talking finance guy name Manny talked me into buy some top of the line package where I don't pay for maintenancefor the life of the vehicle.  Manny said "oh this covers belts and hoses for life any maintenance issue you take the car to any Nissan dealership nationwide and the vehicle will be fixed for free".  Fast forward I bring the car in for the service and find out I was scammed. There is no such package. MOSSY NISSAN SCAMS VETERANS AND DOESN'T HONOR THEIR WORD.</Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

I made an appointment for 10:45 today and received a text confirming the time and date. I arrived a few minutes early and staff said my technician would be with me after his phone call. While waiting there were at least two other vehicles that arrived after me who were helped and their vehicles driven to the garage for service. I waited till about 11:03 and no one came out so I left.<//Text>

I took my car into the service department for an oil change and tire rotation. Let the person working with me know I needed my car fully checked out because I was planning on driving to LA with my nieces. After leaving the lot I was informed by a different driver that my tail light was out. I thought that things like this was part of the inspection of the car. Im extremely disappointed.< /text>

I went back in after an associate told me he would price match my oil change because as of 2017 I haven’t been getting it thru Nissan.the last time I had work done it was a hassle and when I got my car back my center light in my car fell there isn’t glue or anything else holding it up so I’ll have to tape called the Monday after I picked up my car nothing called a few more times nothing... I called months later to make and appointment for my oil change with him... I went in to find out the associate was no longer there ( I spoke to him Friday went in Monday.. I was told they would call me to check warranty on my looking at my light and never heard back from anyone. This location is so bad at calling back I’ve called 2/3 times in a single day and wouldn’t hear back. When you get there everyone is so nice but there’s never any follow thru. I only go here because I live across the street. Every time I’ve taken my car in I always have to call and follow up usually take about 3 calls. Last time they kept my car for over a week with no call back... horrible<//Review>

OUTSTANDING CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE FROM START TO FINISH! I was so close to pulling the trigger and purchasing a car from another dealer, but luckily it didn't work out and I ended up on the lot of Mossy Nissan El Cajon.  I am SO GRATEFUL that I did.  Joe Chavez was the sales associate who helped me and he was the very antithesis of what you expect from a standard "used car salesman." Joe is PATIENT, professional, knowledgeable and honest. He earned my trust and my business for life. He was able to get me my absolute dream car that had he not asked, I don't think I ever would have mentioned because I assumed it was out my budget. But it wasn't. It was an hour before close and you never would have known it, he was taking his time to answer all of my questions (of which I had many) and he made sure I was HAPPY and that it was within my budget. I'm still in awe that I own such a beautiful fully loaded vehicle. I would not have bought this car if it wasn't for Joe. I have to also share that Mark in financing was EQUALLY as EXCEPTIONAL! He was so friendly, and has more than 20 years of experience in the industry and it shows! He was able to finance me at an incredible APR, and keep my payment within my budget even after adding an extended warranty, alarm, and gap insurance (highly recommend all three.) In these unprecedented times, I'm so grateful to have stumbled upon this dealership where their sales and finance teams are people of integrity and professionalism. I can't say enough positive things about this team, and they really did make what could have been a very stressful experience one that was enjoyable and memorable. I'm so happy with everything about this interaction. THANK YOU JOE AND MARK FOR GETTING ME MY DREAM CAR!!!</Review>

Elijah, Sarah and almost everyone I've done business with at this Mossy Nissan (El Cajon), has always been very professional compassionate and genuinely lovely.  Today's visit was no different.  In this COVID-19 era, they're doing things right, following all pandemic protocol, and still offering top-notch service in a calm, clean and friendly atmosphere.  Great job!</review>

I had an appointment and was greeted immediately however had to wait 7 minutes until I was served. The service man was cordial and made sure that all my needs were addressed and that I was heard. My service was good however I thought that some of the charges were way over priced such as $30 to clean my battery terminals and put pads under them. My wife was the one who answered the phone and approved the work had it been me I would have not had that done. I will be back for warranty work but most likely not much else.
that being said, your employees are top notch people and helpful.</Review>

Had a great experience at the service center. I felt I would get the best care for my Nissan Xterra at a dealership and my hopes were not disappointed. Elijah is very customer service oriented I would come back just for his service. The car is running great and I can't ask for anything more. Thank You.<//review>

All BS!
Two days later I had to take the truck in to the shop to complete the setup.
What a waste of time! My time, of course.
The truck and the service guys are great.
Beware of the sales guys! They are pushy and manipulative. No integrity!

<Text>Derek (Sales) was so very very knowledgeable about the model we came in to test drive. I never felt any high pressure sales he really lets the product sell itself. He is very high energy and may have been more excited than us about our purchase. Overall just a super awesome guy to work with. Mike (Finance) helped us understand our options and got us into a payment plan that works for us while also helping us ditch our Jeep with negative equity. This dealership is very lucky to have both Derek and Mike working on their team.</Text>< pictures>

I had a ongoing issue with my convertible top on my 370Z.  After numerous calls to Nissan Consumer Affairs, the General Manager, Mike, at Mossy Nissan El Cajon personally called me and a couple of days later, Mike contacted me back, and informed me that he got Nissan to agree to pay for the repairs with zero cost to me.  Thank you Mike.... I most certainly will be buying my next Nissan from Mossy Nissan El Cajon. :)<//Review>

Mossy of El Cajon has a reputable team, Mossy of Escondido lied to me and told me they have a truck that the Salesman at Mossy of El Cajon clearly had in his possession, the Mossy of Escondido team even let me speak to his Manager Anthony who claimed the same thing.  The Mossy of Escondido team even sent an MSRP saying that truck was on their lot, but it was not...It was in Joe's possession at Mossy of El Cajon major difference between the two dealerships.< /text>

My interaction with Elijah Alvarez was above and beyond.  He explained everything to be done then went over it all when near completion.  We talked about our families, my trip I was going on and made it a calming and appreciative visit. Great customer service is certainly what a person wants when they come in, for whatever reason. I give huge cudos to Elijah. He is indeed a great representative for Nissan, El Cajon.<//text>

This dealership has no loyalty to their potential customers. Im in the market for a potential work vehicle and signed up for a test drive. At the time they were running a promotion to where you are given a code for a $50 Amazon gift card that they have to validate when you test drive a new car. i did just that, their rep CORY GRUBA insisted that he would email the validated code right away and that it would be in my email...nothing. I texted him to question what had happened and he said that the code had already been redeemed the day that i registered, i did the test drive a few days later. So not only did he not email me but he made no efforts to resolve the problem.This dealership is deceiving. DO NOT TRUST CORY GRUBA OR THE GENERAL MANAGER TRAVIS.
I have a SUBARU and they are fantastic cars.</text>

This review is a about the service I've been having at mossy Nissan.  Great place to service your car or any car.  I've always had great experience especially with my service advisor Matt. He's always been going above and beyond to make sure that I'm satisfied with the service and the condition of my car after It had been returned to me.  Thank you mossy Nissan and Matt for taking great care of my car and a timely matter every single time.</Text>

< Review>
I had to go there to the service department and it was a pleasant experience . Everyone was very nice and accommodating.  Joshua was very helpful.  I  thought I had another  problem  I had to go back for but it turned out to be a loose connection  which was causing the check engine light to come on. I liked how we were so taken care of by Joshua  and he had given me his card with his direct number and told me if there was anything else in the future we needed we should call him. So that's what I did .I was told he and everyone else was very busy that day . So I left my number. He was very  prompt and called me back . While we  were waiting  that day we took a walk to look around at the cars on the lot and we spoke to a salesman who was very knowledgeable  and I look forward to doing business with him when the time comes for either a trade in or finance another vehicle.  Overall we had a good feeling about returning to Mossy Nissan . This is the result of what good customer  service  will do . This is how customers want to be treated so they will return and continue to spread the word to friends and family.  Good job Mossy Nissan and also Joshua .< /Review>

I was looking for a mid sized truck. Hard to find these days. David Sapp worked with me and was able to find me the perfect truck. He’s a good guy and easy to work with. The process was painless and way quicker than any other car buying experience I’ve ever had. Also, this is my first Nissan but not my last because of this.</text>

Sarah Tapia is the best service specialist! She always makes sure my questions are answered and that I am kept informed about how things are progressing with my car while it is being repaired. Due to her professionalism and friendly demeanor I have returned each time I have needed a repair and specifically asked for Sarah. Any time someone needs a referral for services I refer them to Mossy Nissan and I tell them to contact Sarah.< /Review>

Best dealership experience that I’ve ever had! My wife and I purchased a used vehicle from Tony and I  couldn’t have asked for a more professional, honest, and straightforward salesman. Car dealerships should strive to meet the same standard as Mossy Nissan El Cajon! Can’t recommend them enough.<//review>

I inquired first via their webpage about a car, they were very fast and prompt to answer all my questions, always very polite and professional, follow up frequently, and when we went in person it was also a very pleasant experience, no hassle no stress, totally enjoyed the process and would buy another car from them again in the future. This is our first Nissan car at home, it will not be the last, more to come!!  IF YOU GO, ASK FOR JOE!<//review>

I'm behind annoyed with Nissan at this time. Obvious manufacturing defects in the paint they refuse to fix (this will cost me under $1.2k, think of how little it would cost you) and an obviously well known CVT issue that can't be fixed because even though my car wouldn't accelerate, they found no error codes. I can't wait to get rid of this car.</review>

<review>I went in for a tail light on the drivers side. They charged me 225.00 I waited for a total of 4 hours and  day after the part was ordered. They sent me on my way..with a now broken passenger side tailight. I took it to my regular mechanic(who only needed the part that mossy could get) and he informed me they put a bad bulb in the passenger side. I forgot to mention, Mossy tried to get me to pay for both lights originally. Im poor so I could only afford to fix the broken one I told them.
They are horrible crooks. Never go there. Save yourself the headache.</review>< Gmap_id>

This is my 3rd Nissan in 15 years. This last Nissan car purchase today is for my teenage daughter. Her 1st car. I love the brand and the people here at Mossy Nissan El Cajon are fantastic! In fact, the guy I was recommended to work with is Joe Chavez Jr. I highly recommend him. He's very pleasant to work with, kind, respectful and fair. Mark in financing was awesome! Thanks guys!< /Text>

<Review>My daughter and I came to purchase a vehicle we seen on the lot with a sticker price of 17,900. Marcus was the sales representative, he told us that was our final price and we denied the extended warranty he offered. My daughter went inside to sign paperwork while I was watching her baby outside. My grandson.  Once done, I reviewed the contact at a glance and noticed they changed 18,900 for the vehicle, i asked her to go find out why and the dealer started if I didn't finance through nissan we didn't get the sale price but they didn't disclose that information at all.  When we got home I looked closer at the contact and they added the extra warranty which we had declined.  I emailed the managerTanya and called Michael but yet got a call back.  Be very careful if buying a vehicle, unsatisfactory communication.</Review>< Name>

<Text>I made an appointment with Derek on Friday, to be there on Saturday @ 9:00 am.
On Saturday Morning, i arrived on time, upon my entrance i was greeted my staff, and I continue to ask for Derek, they informed me when was not there but would arrive at 9:30 am. I informed the person whom i was speaking with that i did not want to wait until 9:30 and was open to speaking with anyone. At the moment Joe came to our rescue, they already had my pre application on file, which i had applied for the previous day, I Already knew the vehicle that i wanted, so it was just all about getting approved. Let me tell you, Joe pulled a bunny out of his hat and made it happen for me, i was like a drive thru he was so helpful! Explained everything to the point about the vehicle was very patient and answered all my questions, before i drove away. He even set up my Bluetooth. Going to tell all my friends, co-workers and relatives "if you go to go Nissan in El Cajon ask for Joe Chavez" =-)<//Text>< Pictures>

<Date>1582517815994</Date><Text>I had purchased my first Nissan Frontier last year up in Oceanside at Mossy Nissan.    Since that time,  I have had some questions about the car's performance and behaviors.    My first contact with Mossy Nissan of Kearny Mesa was a nightmare.   When I got the chance to speak with a representative from their service department, the help was so rude, I simply walked away.  I will never return.    I finally optioned calling Mossy Nissan of El Cajon.     While there,  Johnny Frank handled my service.   I cannot speak enough to his knowledge and personable approach.    I just needed an oil change, and to ask some maintenance questions about the car.   Johnny was great!!!   He answered all the questions about my car, but more importantly,   he was honest and he was nice.    I felt comfortable speaking with him about the car and the maintenance associated with it and did not feel like I was being up-sold or placated as consumer.   By virtue of his professional disposition and honesty,  I will be returning for all service matters associated with the truck.    Please thank him for me.  I feel so much better about owning and maintaining this truck!!</Text>< Name>

Our normal policy is when you get your vehicle diagnosed there is a $150 fee that you sign for. However, if we find the work to be covered under a warranty or to be the result of a mistake made on our part that fee will be waived.  Please contact me directly to discuss this further, my name is Stephanie Decker and you can reach me at (619)588-0500 ext 0.'}< /Resp>< Review>
My car started rattling on the highway after I received service at this location in El Cajon. I took the car back in and asked the Service Manager if the underling cause of rattling in the car was believed to be due to a mistake from a Mossy employee during servicing if I'd have to pay the $150 inspection fee. The Service Manager said yes that is their policy. I asked him a few more questions, because that just doesn’t make sense to me, then I left.

I see that as a policy that dodges accountability. I see that as a policy that could create loopholes for service departments to initiate small issues in vehicles so that customers will come back in and charge them for the inspection (even if It was their fault) and additional required work on the vehicle.

Been doing business here for over two years but not anymore now that I know that is the policy. I’ll go somewhere that’ll actually take a look and own it if they made a mistake, not charge me for it. Zero accountability = zero trust.

I worked with Johnny F. on both occasions. If the information I received was incorrect or if you could help me better understand that policy, reach out. He has my contact info.</Review>

The advisor told me that they were close to closing and they only did the oil change, even though I left my car there since 2pm. I told him that I had requested all the services above when I made the appointment and that I was not a “walk-in” customer. He still said they were about to close and told me my total. I didn’t want to argue so I paid and left but I was disappointed, if I just wanted oil changes then I would walk-in instead of making an appointment.< /Text>< resp>

It was my first time buying a brand new car, I had known what kind of car I wanted but nothing about the process of how to. Mr. DEBARROWS was extremely helpful and walk me through it all. He was very professional and made feel very comfortable on making the decision. I couldn't be more happier and I abousutly love my new car.< /review>

First time buying an “adult” car and it couldn’t have been better ! We went to 9 dealerships before coming here and we got Tony from a recommendation from a friend that works there and he could not have been better ! If you’re looking for a new car that’s is a decent price , come here and see Tony ! He really listened to what i wanted and he delivered and even helped me to find a good rate on car insurance. He goes above and beyond. The entire staff was great even the manager Manny. Had a great first car shopping and financing  experience !< /review>

Not my first time purchasing from Mossy Nissan El Cajon, and every single time it has been great service and experience. I would like to thank the staff that assisted on my most recent purchase, special shout out to Jaeden S! You did awesome and went above and beyond to make it happen and considered everything I was looking for. Definately listened to what I had to say and what I wanted and they did not just try to get me into whatever was convenient for them.  Really recommend, very smooth service and transaction overall. Luuuv my new Kicks! 🎉🚙< /Review>

Gary, the salesperson I worked with, was very low pressure, which was awesome for me. He was very knowledgeable  about  the different models of cars I was interested in, and the features that each one had.  People  in other departments worked with him to make buying my car a simple and stress-free experience. Even when we inadvertently kept them past closing,  everyone was still polite and efficient.  I would definitely go there again for another car !<//Review>

He took the time to answer all of our questions prior to coming in, despite our calling him multiple times. He then took the time to walk me through how to use all of the features on my new Nissan Leaf. Our second purchase from him in the past 6 months.

We could not be happier with the service we receive either.

Gabe is Sales knows exactly what we want and finds it when it is time. No hassles, just straight forward and knowledgeable. If he does not know the answer to my question he will find it fast.

Elija (Check spelling) Runs a great service department and actually cares about his customers.

Sara is our go to in the service department and is just awesome. So much in fact that I now send our chevy sales fleet SUV's to her for service. You are not going to find her trying to sell you services you don't need.

I had to send send both trucks to the body shop, one for an accident, the other for a factory defect. Although it takes such a long time for them to get your vehicle back, the work is great!

Class act from Sales all the way to Management. We will be Nissan fans for some time if this level of service continues to impress.</Review>< Date>

Khar was prompt, friendly and assured me that he would have the vehicle inspected to make sure items weren't replaced (i.e. cabin and air filters),just because it's on the 75k service listing. Car was serviced promptly and returned washed. I was made to feel valued, as a Mossy Nissan customer. I'll be back.</text>

I was impressed with the courtesy and professionalism of the staff. I even enjoyed my conversation with the shuttle driver that gave me a ride home. He really loves his job and said Mossy Nissan El Cajon treats him and all of their employees like family. Maybe that's one of the reasons for the superior service. I want to give a shout out and thanks to your service writer Steven Lopez. Steven took the time to listen to me and just didn't take my keys and write up a service ticket. And, if you are smart, you will never let your detail "artist" John leave your facility. My car never looked so good after he performed his magic.<//Review>< pics>

I am very pleased that Mossy's service department was able to take care of my problem
as quickly and efficiently as they did! I did not have an apt but they were able to help me right away.  The service advisor (Johnny Frank) does a great job for them.  Competent technicians complemented by other efficient personnel makes a great Service Department.

<review>Below par experience. Bought a brand new Nissan NV200 and the experience has not been great. The van itself runs great but was sold with numerous dings and scratches that they will "take care of"... still hasn't been scheduled or anything. Was told to come back to install the overpriced alarm system which scheduling that was a nightmare. Not to mention it took all day to complete when we were promised it was quick. They utilize another company to install shelving and patrician boards which was another nightmare to deal with. Cheap products, overpriced installation and horrible quality of work combined with another 6.5 hour delay to install. This experience has caused my business hardship due to poor management by Nissan and its vendors. Due your research before dealing with this place<//review>< pictures>

Went through the Costco Auto Program and worked this dealer and David Sapp.  David and the team did a great job helping me get a good deal and have since supported me with any questions I have and will have.</Review>

It's all to Josh, the maintenance rep who took care of me.  I called in at 1330 for a 1400 appt.  Met Josh at 1350, and he saved me a few bucks for needed maintenance.  I thanked him for his service as well as what he did for me, all done and out at 1440, quite amazing, thankyou Josh, thankyou Mossy Nissan El Cajon.< /Review>

I will recommend this team to anyone interested in buying a car. Also, they have opened my eyes to the value of a lease. I was unsure in the past and wasn’t aware if there were even any benefits to a lease. The team here was incredibly helpful and pretty much changed my life in this purchase.<//review>< pics>

<Text>I purchased a package deal in which I'd get 3 oil changes for a discounted price from Mossy Nissan of El Cajon. I brought my vehicle in for an oil change for the third time about a week ago. A couple of days after, I noticed that the car was leaking oil. I contacted the service department to schedule a time for me to get the car checked out so that they could rectify the situation. I was scheduled but told that it could take 2-4 hours to look at the vehicle to fix the issue, which I found to be frustrating. It's bad enough that I had to wait 2 hours for an oil change on my initial visit. Disgruntled by the situation, I was determined to try to figure out was wrong. I noticed  that the oil drain plug was loose. I went to an auto parts store purchased a wrench and fixed it myself. At best, it feels like the service was shoddy and careless because it's such a simple task. At worst, it seems a little suspicious that this happened after my last paid oil change.</Text>< Name>

It was amazing all I had to do was drop my car off and pick it up, they put me in a rental till my car was ready and they also did all the calling and handled everything for my car to get serviced through my warrantee. Mike helped me out and did a great job of keeping me in the loop. Definitely will be recommending & going back for any car maintenance! Missy Nissan was so welcoming and helpful; they helped me more than the dealer who sold me my car when I had questions about my warrantee and how to get my car fixed.</Review>

<Text>great, accommodating guys. not to high pressure but thats what sales people do! I enjoyed talking with salesman Tony, nice guy, good salesmanship. The closer also, unfortunately I ended up not able to purchase the truck I wanted because of other expenses that I had, however , they did make me a really good offer. It’ll just have to wait a couple months.I would recommend them!</Text>< user_name>

I made an appointment online for oil change which said would be 40. When I picked up my car it was 86. He said that he used special oil. He didn't review my inspection like other dealerships have done and he continued to argue with me about the price then when I read the invoice it said I had agreed on the upgrades. Worst experience ever< /review>

Thank you Soran for helping us purchase our 4th car with the Mossy Family.

At previous service departments I have been to in Northern California they gave me a packet with detailed information on the multi-point inspections that was very easy to read and follow. That was very helpful. At this dealership I have only gotten receipts and spoken explanations of the inspections.</review>

<review>This dealership is fantastic. Honestly, I had a wonderful experience. Tony, my salesman, was great. He showed me a few vehicles that were within my parameters I set. He was knowledgeable and super friendly. None of the staff were pushy, and Tony got me into my Nissan Juke that day with payments below my requested price. By far the best car buying experience I've had. (And I've had quite a few)</review>< Rating>

Service was ok at best, the staff was nice but not very willing to work with you. Did not seem to know what was going on most of the time, and had to keep checking with their managers to find out more info.

< review>
Jaeden was great!!!  I was disappointed that it took as long as it did, but that was not his fault.  I thought since we had done everything with Milad online and over the phone, it would go a lot faster.  But Jaeden made us very comfortable and was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and was great the entire time.  I would definately recommend him highly!!!!< /review>

Feel very unhappy with what I bribed I was purchasing and what I actually received but this is also partly the fault of NMAC financial. Doubt I’ll buy another Nissan in my life (from the dealer) but service was honest and good. I wish I could make it 3-1/2 stars actually.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

Gabe and the team made my buying experience pleasant, easy and quick. They listened to what I wanted, cut right to the best deal and got me into the right car. It wasn’t a stressful, awkward negotiation or “salesy” conversation. Nissan is great at being authentic and getting to the point. The whole team was great to work with and got me out in time for dinner< /Text>

very low millage, but in our first visit simmed like it was out of our reach.
Here's were their star sales man , Jaeden stepped in and made sure that everything necessary was done so that we could have this nice vehicle,
We are very happy with the  car and the deal we got but. Thank you Jaden for making it happened.

<Time>1560908349849</Time><rating>1</rating><review>Went in despite my previous experiences. Just got brand new tires with alignment and balancing done February 5th. They told me everything was fine. today they check the alignment did an inspection under the tires and rotated the tires, again they told me everything is fine everything is good. what you are seeing in the picture is oil-contaminated grease on the right rear shock which is unknown mileage. This indicates that the rear shocks are leaking in should be recommended for a replacement. in the past they have also said everything was fine during their inspection, when the vehicle was taking in with burnt-out bulbs cracked and splitting wiper blades and other major issues. They failed to do with the paperwork properly, as well as filling to provide inspection reports which their own paperwork says you're supposed to get. and the saddest part is every time I've taken my vehicles in I have worked with the assistant service manager. I've complained to him multiple times about the poor quality of their technicians work, even letting him know that I am trained and have worked as a technician myself so I know what a good job is supposed to look like. And still after 5 months from the first time I've talked with them, they still can't get things right. Update, over a week later and no one has reached out to me as they said they will.

New update as of June 13th. apparently they decided to have the same service advisor that I've been dealing with and having troubles with try giving me a call. Got a news flash for you Mossy. Do you seriously think I want to keep dealing with the same exact person who is being dishonest with me, is that your attempt to try and make things right by having a known dishonest employee try contacting me. the proper thing to at least start trying to remedy something like this is to at least have the general service manager contact me himself seeing how he's the superior to the guy I've been having issues with. you may be able to screw most customers who never look underneath their vehicle and don't even probably understand what they are looking at if they do but it doesn't work with me.

Update June 15th
I have spoken with the general manager. Tuesday afternoon I'll be going to give him a demonstration in a small training session on how to properly inspect a vehicle during service.

Probably final update June 18th
I met with an walk the general manager around my vehicle today. he admitted to me that a lot of the things that they miss seeing was pretty much an excusable from a business in customer service. He tells me he's going to see about making some changes based on a few things he even learned from me about the industry and what to look at. In closing I just want people to be mindful of my experience, but don't be afraid to give them a try in the aftermath in case they do make improvements.</review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAvoNmXeFPjs6bAwMrhALsTFnUV08hJv3rp82m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipORJ2UBBlC4r7uZbHWKb8BFYCVzxpNgp0r3U_rl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1559684291531, 'text': 'Hi Richard, we are sorry to hear about your negative experiences.

< Review>
Got a new Rogue on Saturday and had the best experience ever! Tony was our salesman and he really listened and is very knowledgeable, he and Mike, the manager, really helped us out. My husband and I weren't sure we would be able to get anything yet, there were 5 months left on our Cruze lease, but with a 1 year old and a long road trip coming up we didn't want to do it in that little car, we knew it would be uncomfortable and not enough space. So we decided to see if we could get out of the lease early, even though we didn't think it would fit our budget. They really worked with us, we got exactly what we wanted, and an incredible deal, that we just couldn't pass up. Everyone there was really great and we are so excited about our new Rogue!<//Review>

< Review>
This is the third time I have leased a car from Mossy Nissan El Cajon.  The reason is first, the excellent salesman I worked with, Derek Cornell.  I leased my first Rogue through Derek in 2013.  Returned to him to lease again in 2016 and now in 2019.  He is professional, personable, explains clearly and is dedicated to meeting my needs.  I also found the service center to be excellent when I returned regularly for maintenance.<//Review>

Khar is a SUPERB service advisor manager! He is always available on Saturdays and very easy to make appointments with him!

On the other hand, I have reported this repeatedly that they should put some napkins with their coffee condiments but the management never made any improvements at all.<//review>

Mossy Nissan El Cajon just charged my family member over $500.00 for brakes and oil and $300.00 of it was for labor costs! Now she can’t pay her bills this month. One of the descriptions was “Labor to perform maintenance interval.” Like that’s a real thing. That was $95.00! And then they wanted to do it to her again for next payday! $400.00 for fuel injection. Mossy should give a disclaimer/warning on their new cars. Warning. Not recommended for sale to those who are not rich. We cancelled the next appointment and won’t go back ever again.
I forgot to mention that they tried to charge me for an "arm" $1,000.00 last year and then they put it in wrong. Caused very loud screeching noises. I had to bring it back in and they said it was put in wrong.</Text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I went into Mossy Nissan of El Cajon for a routine oil change. When I went in I decided to browse around the showroom for a SUV for my family. I was approached by a young gentleman by the name of Anthony who asked if I had any questions. I told him that I was interested in trading in my vehicle to get an SUV for my family. He asked me if I had time so he could show me around and give me some options that may suit me. I told him yeah and he was very hospitable as well by offering me something to drink. We went out to the car lot and he showed me a list of different options in my price range. he was not pushy or trying to shove a certain vehicle at me. Instead we started with the base models and worked our way up. He let me test drive two different models and I fell in love with each one. We then came back to the dealership and worked on seeing what the price range would be for my monthly bill. Unfortunately I wasn't able to get the financing that I wanted so I passed on that deal. But he did not let me leave unhappy because he presented me another option that I ended up taking. He asked me if I was interested in trading my older car in for a newer car because they had dealership bonuses and rebates for purchasing a newer vehicle. I did want a new car no matter what and something more spacious and luxurious. He showed me the Nissan Altima 2018 Sr series. Very sporty and rims and at the same price as the base model at the time of the sale. Got me a great deal on the trade-in value of my vehicle and we sign the paperwork. Anthony took his customer service to the next level by meeting me at my job because I was in a hurry to get to work. We filled out the paperwork at my job and made it official. This guy is top-class customer service and the dealership is very lucky to have him. I give the dealership and Anthony a 5-star rating because it is well deserved.< /Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>Karr our service advisor gave a great deal on four new tires and oil change.  Great service and even shuttled us to we’re we wanted to go while getting the car done. 😀👍Come to find out he didn’t give us the warranty on the tires.  After having an issue on one of the tires a good person st Nissan took care of it. For that reason I’ll leave the five stars.</review>< pics>

Matt Ivko was my service adviser.  He took me on time.  We went into his office.  He explained exactly what was going to happen.  I went into the waiting room.  Matt went into the waiting room to make sure I was comfortable and updated me on my car.  When my car was finished, (earlier then expected), we went back to his office and he went over the inspection and the service that just took place.  He answered all of my questions with answers I truly understood.  He is a wonderful service person.  He is exactly what you want and need to represent your company!</Review>

I scheduled a drop off taxi to take me back to my house and when I got checked in the person who was going to drive me back home was sitting there on his phone and texting and I had to wait for him to get done before I can get taken back to my residence. I made the reservation for a certain time and he took me when he felt like it so i would like that part of the aspect to be a little bit more prompt as far as customer service.

on the other hand, Sarah is the best and I will continue to go back to her all the time for the journey of my car.</Review>

This review has no reflection on the service technician them self. It is my overall experience with my car which I loved. My car is 5 years old and it already needs a new transmission and cooler kit according to the service writer. I cant believe this, I understand my car has 106,000 miles. A service bulletin was put out about the cooler kit needing to be added to my vehicle. which I was told i needed to pay for myself. I call Nissan of North America I received a case number, of course when i took my car in for diagnostic before even looking at the car the service writer said ohhh yeah new transmission. A $4,500, I cant understand, on a 5 year old car. On top of this they need to "keep" the car for additional diagnostic just in case. I was also told I would need to pay for my own rental car, Chula vista offered my when my phone call was transferred to the wrong location. I did receive a call the following day saying I needed to bring my car back for additional information, at this point i have not done so. Before leaving on the previous day, Other recommendation were suggested totaling 8,700. which I would need to miss work for as well as have a rental car for a week on my expense. My car is not ever worth that much. This is all very disappointing to me.</Review>

<review>This review is specifically for the service center: Robb and Elijah.
Went to my mechanic yesterday because my check engine light was on and showing a P0101 error meaning there is an issue with the Mass Airflow Sensor. Mechanic called Nissan to see if he could order the part, Joe in the parts department notified him it was under warranty and advised me to make an appointment ASAP. My mechanic cleared the error codes to turn off my check engine light and sent me on my way.
Showed up at 7am for my appointment this morning and left my car with Robb. Got a call around 9am that because the error code was cleared, Nissan could not service my car. At no point yesterday did anyone advise those codes needed to be kept in the system for it to be covered under warranty. Spoke with Service Manager Elijah who advised that there was nothing he could do until my Check Engine Light came on again. For them to hook up the computer to my car takes no more than 5 minutes (I watched my mechanic do it yesterday) there was NO reason it should have taken over 2 hours. All over a $20 part, he was citing company policy and attempting to blame the miscommunication on my mechanic and not taking responsibility for the actions of him team. I got nothing more than an apology for the frustration experience. As they say, never ruin an apology with an excuse.
So now I'm expected to drive my car, which has been having performance issues due to the MAF, unsafely with a KNOWN issue from here to Arizona this weekend. This is by far the worst customer service experience I have ever dealt with.<//review><pics>None< /pics>< response>

I scheduled a drop off taxi to take me back to my house and when I got checked in the person who was going to drive me back home was sitting there on his phone and texting and I had to wait for him to get done before I can get taken back to my residence. I made the reservation for a certain time and he took me when he felt like it so i would like that part of the aspect to be a little bit more prompt as far as customer service.

on the other hand, Sarah is the best and I will continue to go back to her all the time for the journey of my car.< /text>

This is hands down the best car shopping experience I have ever had.  My car guide was Soran Pasha, who is experienced, intuitive, knowledgeable, and patient.  I never felt pressured or manipulated to make decisions I was not ready to make.  Soran answered questions regarding the specs on each car we test drove and shared his love of autos with us.  If you ask for Soran, you will not be disappointed.  In fact, the staff at Mossy Missan were all courteous and helpful.  It took a long time for me to get insured to drive home my new car, but they were awesome and not as impatient as I was.  I will be looking forward to working with Soran in future regarding servicing my new Nissan.< /Text>

<username>Kevin Herrera<//username><Review>Dropped my car off and what i was told would be done was not performed. What was said was done had no way to verify. As an example, i was told a multi point inspection was done, but nothing indicating what was checked. I know for a fact my car needs additional work and was expecting the inspection to tell me what exactly. As far as i could tell nothing was actually done to my car.

A mix of false promises, with no proof of what was done, and no follow up really does not put any trust in El Cajon Nissan. My car was in for the 15k mile tune up and it was not performed after being there all day.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Review>Well Andy Fisher is the BEST service manager on the planet, why he hasn’t been promoted yet is beyond comprehension.. Wherever Andy goes we go, so you had better hang on to him !
Karl Kirker in Fleet Sales is our go to guy, you had better keep him also !
Joe in the parts department, and John the mechanic, are always there for us !
You now Have a newcomer, Gary Femrite, in sales, who just helped us get a great deal on a 2020 Murano, for Fausto and Celeste’s 35 wedding anniversary.
He was kind, courteous, knowledgeable, and a big help in getting the deal done in a professional and expedient manor, you had better hang on to him too !<//Review><gmap_id>0x80d959d22e0ef5f9:0x51a6237cea3c5fbc</gmap_id>< Date>

<review>Karr our service advisor gave a great deal on four new tires and oil change.  Great service and even shuttled us to we’re we wanted to go while getting the car done. 😀👍Come to find out he didn’t give us the warranty on the tires.  After having an issue on one of the tires a good person st Nissan took care of it. For that reason I’ll leave the five stars.< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

From the moment I drove onto the lot I was greeted with a smile and a hand shake! Shawn was fantastic. He helped my girlfriend and I find exactly what we were looking for. After a longggggg day we were finally able to drive our dream car off the lot. We hit some bumps in the process but Shawn never gave up and continued to help us until we got what we wanted. Once we finally got our car we had to talk Manny who continued to make us knowledgeable and comfortable with our new purchase. I had so many questions and he was patient and extremely helpful.  From start to finish I had the most easy and successful experience a customer could ask for! Thank you Missy Nissan if El Cajon for all that you do! We will continue to do business with you in the near future 🙏🏼🙏🏼😅😅< /Text>

Went here for a blue Nissan leaf my wife found. Funny to be writing a positive review of a car dealer, but Derek was by far the best of the 5 dealers we went to. Took the time to listen and make our numbers work and clearly walk us through the process. Would refer anyone to Derek, and of course we love our leaf!!</review>

Yes, it is true that a vehicle can be sold as new with high mileage and may have it for a number of reasons. However, regardless of the mileage on your vehicle, your new car warranties (3 year - 36,000 miles and 5 year 60,000 miles) won't begin until you purchase the vehicle so you will have the full extent of the warranty until roughly 36,500/ 60,500 (to the exact mileage that you purchased it at).  Unfortunately tires are not covered under manufacturer warranties. What I believe the sales manager was trying to express is that tires SHOULD be rotated with at least every other oil change, but no it is not a given that service will do it because it is an additional cost, and it is not included in an oil change. Typically your tires should wear fairly evenly and that is why the manager was suggesting that the tire rotations most likely haven't been done like they should have been.  Again, we are so sorry that you have not been treated with the utmost respect we aim to give every customer and that you have not been completely satisfied with your experiences  with us. Please reach out to our general sales manager to discuss further (619)588-0500 ext 0."}<//response>< text>
My experience with this storm is very bad I would never buy a nother vehicle at this store again. On  4/21/2018 I went to mossy to trade in my Ford edge so I can buy a Nissan Pathfinder. This car was on the Lot as a new car, I was very happy to buy my self a new car for the first time. After closing the deal I went  home and park it in my garage, two days later I realize it has 500 miles on it. I was very unhappy I went back to the store to talk to the store manager about it. He's response to me was what do you want me to do you already signed the check and he walked away and went back to his desk. He was very rude about it he did not even try to find out nothing about it . From my experience a car with 500 Miles on it should not sell as a new car. Now I have another problem with the tires on this car I have this car for less than two years and the tires on the front of this vehicle already need to be changed, thay have no thread leave on them. The other two  tires on the back are still looking brand new and I don't drive this car alot. If this car was a new car I should not have to change tires. Already  once again I went back to the store to complain about the tires and one of the Managers take a look at it and once again thay want to say that it is my fault that I did not rotate the tires. This manager told me that every time a vehicle come in for an oil change thay rotate the tires and if I do that my tires would not be like that. I know thats not true he is just lying on 12/31/2018  at 12.36 pm I  got an oil change done on that saame vehicle and they did not rotate the tires and l have proof because i have the paperwork. All I want is for the store to replace my two front tires. I just hope that no one else has to go through this bad experience that I go through.<//text>

< Review>
I have been coming to Mossy for 5 years for all of my oil changes and maintenance/upkeep on my 2014 Juke. I love my car and I love that the service department is helpful and efficient. They always go over recommendations and never try to "upsell" me unnecessary services. Making an appointment is super easy and my car always looks great because they take the time to wash it after every visit.</Review>

< review>
Dropped my car off and what i was told would be done was not performed. What was said was done had no way to verify. As an example, i was told a multi point inspection was done, but nothing indicating what was checked. I know for a fact my car needs additional work and was expecting the inspection to tell me what exactly. As far as i could tell nothing was actually done to my car.

A mix of false promises, with no proof of what was done, and no follow up really does not put any trust in El Cajon Nissan. My car was in for the 15k mile tune up and it was not performed after being there all day.</review>

<text>Well Andy Fisher is the BEST service manager on the planet, why he hasn’t been promoted yet is beyond comprehension.. Wherever Andy goes we go, so you had better hang on to him !
Karl Kirker in Fleet Sales is our go to guy, you had better keep him also !

I visited the parts dept.  The guy at the desk wasn't very helpful when I asked about an O ring that was missing from the part I was buying from them.  He said I would have to provide the vin for him to look it up. I guess their system is so antiquated that they do not have a cross reference for the part he was selling me.< /text>

I took my Nissan Sentra 2004 to Sarah in service (who is awesome) and unfortunately she told me that the repairs were more than what the car was worth. So I decided to trade it in and she recommended to talk to Tony. Tony made the car experience extremely easy. He was very understanding of my situation and got me a great deal. I ended up getting a Nissan Rogue 2016 (major step up from the Sentra). Tony explained all the details to me and it made buying a new car very easy. If you’re going to buy a Mossy Nissan at E Cajon I highly recommend Tony, he’s the guy to talk to.</review>

Derek my sales man was everything I wanted in a sales man. He was informative, he paid attention to what my needs were.

And the Sentra that I bought fits me like a glove.

I'm extremely happy with Mossy Nissan of El Cajon.

< Review>
I thought Nissan's were reliable and come to find out, ever since they started  installing these CVT transmissions everyone that owns a Nissan has or will have problems. Most don't last more than 120k miles, I took my car in since my transmission went out at 164k and the service guy said "Oh you got a good transmission, I have seen some go out at 20k". Once I left there I went online and did my research and found ton of ppl having the same issue, some having 3 transmission replaced and the car had less than 20k miles on it.

There is a bunch of lawsuits out at the moment and I hope Nissan gets it together... Oh not to mention these transmissions will cost you, your first born.< /Review>

< Review>
My experience with this storm is very bad I would never buy a nother vehicle at this store again. On  4/21/2018 I went to mossy to trade in my Ford edge so I can buy a Nissan Pathfinder. This car was on the Lot as a new car, I was very happy to buy my self a new car for the first time. After closing the deal I went  home and park it in my garage, two days later I realize it has 500 miles on it. I was very unhappy I went back to the store to talk to the store manager about it. He's response to me was what do you want me to do you already signed the check and he walked away and went back to his desk. He was very rude about it he did not even try to find out nothing about it . From my experience a car with 500 Miles on it should not sell as a new car. Now I have another problem with the tires on this car I have this car for less than two years and the tires on the front of this vehicle already need to be changed, thay have no thread leave on them. The other two  tires on the back are still looking brand new and I don't drive this car alot. If this car was a new car I should not have to change tires. Already  once again I went back to the store to complain about the tires and one of the Managers take a look at it and once again thay want to say that it is my fault that I did not rotate the tires. This manager told me that every time a vehicle come in for an oil change thay rotate the tires and if I do that my tires would not be like that. I know thats not true he is just lying on 12/31/2018  at 12.36 pm I  got an oil change done on that saame vehicle and they did not rotate the tires and l have proof because i have the paperwork. All I want is for the store to replace my two front tires. I just hope that no one else has to go through this bad experience that I go through.</Review>

{'time': 1580503343223, 'text': "Lincoln, thank-you for your feedback, we are so sorry to hear about your negative experience in dealing with our staff here at Mossy Nissan El Cajon. Yes, it is true that a vehicle can be sold as new with high mileage and may have it for a number of reasons. However, regardless of the mileage on your vehicle, your new car warranties (3 year - 36,000 miles and 5 year 60,000 miles) won't begin until you purchase the vehicle so you will have the full extent of the warranty until roughly 36,500/ 60,500 (to the exact mileage that you purchased it at).  Unfortunately tires are not covered under manufacturer warranties. What I believe the sales manager was trying to express is that tires SHOULD be rotated with at least every other oil change, but no it is not a given that service will do it because it is an additional cost, and it is not included in an oil change. Typically your tires should wear fairly evenly and that is why the manager was suggesting that the tire rotations most likely haven't been done like they should have been.  Again, we are so sorry that you have not been treated with the utmost respect we aim to give every customer and that you have not been completely satisfied with your experiences  with us. Please reach out to our general sales manager to discuss further (619)588-0500 ext 0."}< /Response>

I bought my 2018 rogue from Anthony DeBarrows and he got me an amazing deal. I had been shopping around for a new car dealing with sleazeballs at other dealerships that I was expecting the same from him. TOTALLY NOT THE CASE. He had me laughing from the start. 11 months later I got into a horrible accident around xmas and my car was totaled. I knew right away I was going to go right back to Tony. I had called him up told him what happened and he kept reaching out to see how I was doing. He really went above and beyond for me. I decided then Nissan and Tony will be the only place for me. My mom was a die hard Honda driver for as long as I can remember. She was with me both times I was getting my cars. She even bought a car from Nissan and said Tony was the reason she made the switch. I can go on and on about how the company as a whole makes the car buying experience a breeze.</Text>< Pics>

My experience with your Service technician was absolutely amazing. I am use to feeling that the dealership is trying to make me pay for service that is unnecessary.   Karr on the other hand made me feel like he was looking out for my best interest.   Even though my car had to stay in the shop for over a week for repairs.  Karr called me on a regular basis to keep me updated and made sure my loaner car was working for me.   Karr needs to be a supervisor and train the rest of your service managers.</Review>

I would like to compliment Joseph Lee for his outstanding customer service he provided me and my wife. He was very professional, helpful and answered all of our questions. He also worked very hard to find a deal that was in our budget. This place goes above and beyond to get you the deal that is right for you. It was definitely worth the drive from the Imperial Valley and I would recommend it to friends and family.<//Text>

<Text>I've been getting my car serviced at Nissan for a long time. Customer service has had it's ups and down at this location for years.

An oil change took 4 hours once and 2 hours on another visit. So, I started to drive out of my way to find a friendlier experience at a different location.

Recently I've had to go back to this location due to time constraints. It seems as though they have changed a few things for the better. I'm happy again.

In my opinion service is best in the late afternoon.< /Text>< Pics>

My wife and I had excellent service here when we recently got a new 2018 Rogue! Shawn and Mike were both exemplary and very low pressure! I have also had awesome service experiences here getting my Altima serviced! I definitely recommend!<//review>

Jaeden and the finance team over at Mossy Nissan of El Cajon were able to get me a great deal with a great apr! They went back and fourth with the bank to get this deal done and in the end I left with a brand new car. Riding my motorcycle was fun but now I can enjoy driving my family around in a safe vehicle.</Review>< pics>

Shawn Hussain is the man! While all the employees here we're polite and knowledgeable, he was the best!  He listened to what I wanted and looked for every discount I could get. If there were any option for 6 stars Mossy Nissan of El Cajon would get it.
🌟Great selection on and off site!
🌟Competitive financing! (BEAT Navy Federal's rate!)
🌟Nice and clean facility!
🌟Knowledgeable salespeople who work for you!
🌟Military discount!
🌟A good chill vibe. Not pushy.

<Text>I went to buy a part. Very helpful, but took a few minutes of standing at the parts counter to get noticed by the 2 men behind the counter, both at computers. Auto salesman approached later on the lot, all smiles. When I told him I wasn't ready to buy another Nissan, his expression went flat, and he was gone in a second. I will buy another Nissan soon, but not from him.<//Text>< user_id>

<text>We were greeted in the front lot by Isai Estrada, Sales Consultant who was friendly, patient and very helpful. We test drove a few models and zeroed in on the model we came in to see. From there Gary Craig, Purchasing & Leasing Consultant worked with us (and for us) to make the numbers work. Then off to the Finance Manager, Marco Obeso who was very detailed and informative.

Our overall experience was great!

It makes you feel good buying from a Dealership you genuinely like.
We're very satisfied with our 2019 Nissan Frontier SV Crew Cab.

With the exception of my Service Adviser who is great, I don't feel that Nissan gives adequate inspection service. I brought my car in to be serviced on this past Saturday, told everything was ok just needed to replace air filter soon. Only to be stranded a few days later due to my battery leaking cells and died on me while I was in Big Bear on a bridge over the lake where it is was very dark. Had to wait over an hour for a tow truck and then had to get a new battery. Cost me almost $300. This could have been prevented had the service technicians done their job without rushing my car through to process the next vehicle. The connector cables were very loose as well. Also, and this is an example: my windshield wipers were ok, but at my last service inspection I was told they needed to be replaced. Have not replaced them as of yet so how are they ok now? I'm a VERY concerned customer. Did my vehicle get an actual Point Inspection the hour I was there because CLEARLY things were missed. Highly disappointment with Nissan! I think your service technicians are rushing, are over worked and don't do their job to the best of their ability. Luckily, I didn't have any children with me when this occurred.< /Text>

I have to give this low review due to the financing supervisor being so rude while we were talking the financing agent. Keep in mind they knew that it was my wife's birthday. Clay the Sales Rep was great and honest. But, that all went downhill during the financing process. FYI, my wife has great credit and that was not the issue.

For example:

Me: "Sir, how much does it cost to replace the battery on a Leaf Nissan."

Financing Agent: "I don't know its 10:00 PM."

Me: I am worried repairs about this vehicle since I have never worked on an electrical vehicle."

Financing Agent: " Don't worry about it you will not keep the car for over 4 years." FYI - I am financing for 6 years!!!!

Then to top off this rude service some female supervising/manager BANGS on the door saying I have to put something away. At this point I am done and get up to leave. These people ruined my wife's  birthday present.!!!!

I will follow up to find out who that female supervisor was in order to inform NISSAN what type of customer service people they have working for them.

Again Clay was great everyone else no customer service.< /review>

<text>I would give this a 0 star if possible...…
I made an appointment to have my car services. I arrived at my appointment time only to find out the lift is broken. (Why did I not get a call cancelling my appointment?).   After I left, I received an e-mail telling me that I missed my appointment only to be followed by a phone call asking about how my service went. I called back to give my feedback and was hung up on.        When I left the initial appointment (or lack of), I was told someone would call me 2 days later with a status update.   No call received.  I have now tried calling 3 more times only to be sent to the black hole of voice mail.   Nobody in the service department seems to want to work at customer service.           This is our second service with Mossy EC - at the first one, they disputed that we bought the extra protection and we had to prove it to them only to have them not believe us so they had us wait 4 hours to verify the policy - which was correct by the way.<//text>< Pictures>

Mossy Nissan was a Amazing experience. I have bought several cars before and I have never got such a deal like this one. Karl Kirker was fantastic was fantastic, he wasn't pushy, gave me different options and he really worked really hard to get me best price and payment I was looking for. When it came time to sign the paperwork Franco did not pressure me to buy extra things but gave me a really good deal on something I wanted. Mossy Nissan has a really wonderful caring team. I wont ever buy anyplace else.< /review>

Great service and selection. Cory helped my wife and I, answering any and all questions, and showed us each vehicle that we were interested in, inside and out, talking and showing us each feature. So happy with our trip there and would definitely recommend. Thank you Cory and thank you Mossy!</Text>

<text>I take one of our cars to get serviced here. It was originally purchased there. Service department tends to be busy but if you call in advance to set up an appointment you should be fine. They offer shuttle service, waiting room, wifi and refreshments while you wait. My rating is based on a recent experience with them, sense then everything has been resolved and i look forward to continue servicing my car with them. Service is good and reps are polite, i do feel that perhaps they are a bit understaffed at the moment.< /text>< pics>

< Review>
Worst place ever. DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE. Very dishonest and False promises made. Was told a year ago that if I co-signed with my sister, she can "EASILY" their words refinance in a few months to get me off the loan and build her credit. It's been 1 and 1/2 years and when we went to refinance, they said not our problem go to a bank or credit union. I called dealer in attempts to rectify this matter and for lack of a better term, they blew smoke "you know where" again as if to say I'm not important, any longer they already made the sale last year.  They never called me back after promising that he'd talk to Vincent and see if something can be done. Now I'm angry, at least acknowledge that nothing can be done. During the purchase VINCE the Sales Rep will jump up and down and make it sound like you made a purchase of a life time. Be careful, they'll scam you quickly. I DO NOT recommend this dealership for their shady practice and plan to contact the Better Business Bureau so that other innocent people don't get wrapped into buying a car from this less than caring and heartless dealer that only focus on "their winnings".  There are other dealers that will be honest and sincere.</Review>

Worst experience ever we wanted a blue rogue and they thought just by our looks we couldn't afford  it. You did us a favor we went over to El Cajon Ford and got a fully loaded blue edge with the premium warranty and 0% financing we couldn't be happier. You really shouldn't judge a book by its cover. If I could give -5 on stars I would. You should also know what your President day specials are. #ElCajonFordRocks<//text>

<rate>5< /rate><text>I bought a used 2016 Nissan Rogue yesterday at Mossy Nissan in La Mesa/El Cajon. Tony was my “salesman”. Couldn’t have asked for a better experience! While he iiiiis a salesman, he didn’t try to sell me on anything I didn’t need or want. He asked what I was looking for, and we walked the lot for a few minutes to see my options. I was upfront in saying nothing down and what I wanted my monthly payment at. He didn’t try to push any upgraded models on me, or even try to show me what features I was missing out on if I stuck to the lower model that hit my price point. The dealership may see that as a downfall, not trying to upsell a more expensive model (hopefully not, as I never write reviews and would hate for this one to backfire on Tony). I’m the type though, if I told you my needs and wants, and what I want to spend, and you push for more, I’ll walk and go somewhere else. So, in a sale for someone of my type, Tony was on point from start to finish. Super knowledgeable on the cars, helped me set up the Bluetooth feature before I left the lot. He was awesome, very personable, and fun to talk to while finance was doin their thing. His manager (sorry, forgot his name) was awesome. I honestly don’t recall a single employee passing by me without saying hello with a smile on their face. Great dealership! Great employees! Great experience! ‘Nough said.< /text>< pics>

<text>Ive had the pleasure of meeting Andy Fisher, Service Advisor for Mossy Nissan El Cajon, Ca about 15 years ago and have taken all of my Nissan vehicles to him since the first time he serviced my little Sentra. He has always made sure i understood what my vehicle needed and whats was necessary to ensure top performance of my cars. I recently purchased my third Nissan from this dealership because of the quality of service received from the service department and the  sales department! Definitely first class Car and Service Dealersip. Thanks Andy and the Sales team for all you do!

I had made an Appt. for Saturday, I had told the Lady who assisted if she could change my name that they had on file, when I got to the dealer  the name had not been changed so I asked the adviser if he could please change it which he assured me and he supposedly did in front of me. I called back today because I lost my receipt and the gentlemen who answer was very polite and he said if an available adviser can call me back due to them being busy so then this guy calls me back ( did not sound professional at all) and says you had a question?? I explained to him and he tries to look up my vehicle with first last name and that did not work and then when he looked it up with VIN he says well the Adviser did not change the name,  and I'm just like well I asked specifically two times to change the name so I asked to speak with Manager and he says its me your talking to, so that was a big surprise because he surely did not care about Customers and I was about to spend almost 2K in service which in this case I rather take my money elsewhere.< /review>

Here is a big shout out to service adviser Khar who went out of his way to go the second mile for us. My 2017 Nissan Pathfinder SV had a bad radio unit, but my vehicle was just slightly outside the mileage warranty. He negotiated a replacement unit with the company, and provided a loaner vehicle during the repair. Thank you sir for your awesome service. You are a scholar and a gentleman.<//text>

<Time>1496698359997</Time><Rating>5</Rating><review>I would like to compliment Joseph Lee for his professional service he provided me. I told him up front I was not buying a car, just doing research on three different vehicles for my wife who is having visibility issues in our current car.  He showed me each one, got to sit in each one and he answered all my questions(I had a lot.) He probably spent at least an hour with me going over all the features of each car. Besides the loud mouth on the megaphone outside your dealership, my experience was fantastic. Please pass this along to Joseph for his professional courtesy and outstanding knowledge of all vehicles. One more thing, there was absolutely no pressure at all to buy that day!! I appreciated that very much.<//review>< Pics>

Asked if car was available and was told It was, to first offer; which I promptly made at offering price. Wanted to pay cash. Completed all paper work. Salesman said he had to check with manager.

< Review>
Great customer service (I had Edgar Suarez as my service advisor). An oil change, tire rotation, and car wash took about an hour and a half on a Friday. Not too bad compared to some of the other Nissan places in SD. The only negative thing I have to say is that I mentioned a weird sound my car was making when I first got there and it seemed like they were going to take a look at it but didn't mention it afterwards. I forgot to ask about it before I left but my car seems to be fine now so maybe it was a quick fix and they just didn't mention it? Overall, good experience though.< /Review>

I wouldn't buy an electric car from this store.  The charging cord that came with my 2019 nissan leaf wouldn't charge and they wouldn't replace it.  They said they didn't have a way to test it, and that was the extent of it.  I had an electric car with no way to charge it.</Text>

<text>My experience at Mossy Nissan dealership has been nothing but the best. I had a 2010 jeep compass I thought I could never get rid of. The salesman David Gunn really helped me out a lot . He was very patient, understanding and helped me get the best deal. Also,  the finance manager Mark Benchekroun was very helpful and patient. He broke everything down to me and made sure I walked out the dealership with the best deal. I highly recommend going to this dealership.< /text>< UserId.>

< review>
I love this place!  They are so friendly and helpful.  I am always apprehensive about trying to purchase a car because of how some places and salesmen treat females....but not here!  They treated me like family from start to finish.  The General Manager, Jake McElroy is such a nice guy and he makes time for his customers. I worked with Joe Chavez and the sales manager Bill Dorrel when I purchased my Armada, such an amazing experience.  The finance guy Marco was super helpful in helping me make the decision on the "extra" stuff that I wanted and was not at all pushy. I will definitely be going back to them for all of my future new car purchases.< /review>

My name is Ziba, I purchased my car from Mossy Nissan in El Cajon on ------------, when I purchased the my car it only had ---- miles and the sales person in the dealership assured me that the vehicle is without accident  and in almost new condition, he also gave me a Carfax at the time of purchase which showed no accident or issues with the car. I recently had a scratch on my front bumper and took it to a body shop to remove the scratch by polishing the bumper, they have noticed the entire front passenger side of the vehicle was involved in a major accident which was not disclosed by the dealer at the time of sale, the bodyshop also showed me how the paint is different and how the front bumper and fender were both removed and fixed and pout back.
I am a woman who never shopped for a car on her own, and the reason I purchased my vehicle from this dealership was to make sure I do not get scammed by third-party sellers and small dealers.
I went back to the dealership as soon as I noticed the issue and spoke with Vincenzo Tomasello which introduced himself as the sales manager in Mossy Nissan of El Cajon.
He ran a new Carfax and showed me that there was no accident at the time of purchase to disclosed and told me I can go to the court if I want to but they will not do anything about this issue.
I know my car is now worth at least $4000 below market due to the accident and I will have a very hard time selling it in the future, I am choosing to take this mater to the court, DMV and also filing a complaint

<rating>1<//rating><Text>The assistant manager called and told me a shuttle would be picking me up within the hour so I could get my Sentra back. An hour and a half later, still nothing. I called back twice and left a VM to get an update. I had to call the customer service line to get assistance. When he finally called me back, he said my car is still not fixed yet, because the person working on my vehicle went to lunch and never informed him. He then said it would be another 30 mins for the shuttle. It’s been another 40 minutes and still nothing. My car needed a sensor change & then washed. That’s it. It has now been over 5 hours since my appt. I wish Mossy Nissan had been honest and provided me an overestimation of time on how long it was supposed to take to fix my vehicle, rather than lie and waste my time. I could have worked out my day accordingly if I had know it was going to take all day. My time is extremely valuable just like everyone else. I had a lot to get done today and still have no clue when my car will be done or when a shuttle will be by to pick me up (I live 3.5 miles away). I have been a loyal customer to Nissan for over 5 years. I’m completely disappointed and will no longer be getting my vehicle serviced here.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1544124514440, 'text': 'Jaime, I apologize for the issues you experienced during your visit to our Service Department.

My wife loves her Murano more than her husband and her husband loves Mossy Nissan because he doesn't have to change the oil of her Murano
Their service departments great people are friendly and you don't get hammered by the salespeople</review>

Mossy owns several car lots in this area and I've bought several from them   over my car buying years.  I find them up front with prices and other contract dealings. They are considerate helpful.< /Review>

Going into Mossy Nissan with all the options and types of vehicles to choose from I luckily had the pleasure to work with Randy Shamo, who not only made it easy to narrow down the type of vehicle I was interested in but also worked out a great deal for me. I could not be happier with my Nissan Rogue and especially the great customer service that was shown to me. Thank you Mossy Nissan and Thank You Randy Shamo.<//Review>

My last experience with then was great! They had a shuttle to drive me home less than 5 mins, changed oil in an hour, and got me back to my car. I had a very bad experience the time before. I took a thorough survey about how unhappy I was and had this experience the next time around.</Review>

< review>
NOT TOO HAPPY with the auto service area. Andy was very rude, I scheduled an appointment with him to have my car serviced, the day of my appointment he tells me-- I do not have time for your car today, come back another day. Completely blows me off. SO OF COURSE I reschedule for another appointment (with a supervisor) 6 weeks later & $600.00 spent (for a tune-up) my car is now leaking oil and is running HOT. This will be my very last time having my car serviced at the MOSSY NISSAN OF EL CAJON. UNDERSTAND IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE MONEY $600.00 SPENT ON A TUNE-UP IT IS ABOUT MY TIME AS WELL, & ME HAVING THE ISSUE OF AN OIL LEAK AND NOW MY CAR RUNNING HOT.< /review>

Had the pleasure of being served by Soran Pasha, Product Consultant at Mossy Nissan, El Cajon. He is an alter mate customer service person. He made car buying experience just easier and with simplified detail. Make sure you ask for Soran Pasha should yo be looking to purchase a car at Mossy Nissan, El Cajon. Thank you Soran! Keep the good work.</review>

Top Notch Professionalism!  This is the 3rd car I buy from Mossy Nissan of El Cajon and each time I've had an outstanding experience.  I just purchased a 2017 Altima SL from Ryan.  I told him what I wanted and he delivered exactly what I asked for and didn't try to sway me into anything else.  Travis in financing explained everything in detail and went through each of the forms in detail.  Khar in the service department is always ready to take care of my concerns and questions in regards to servicing my Nissan.  The dealership itself is a very fun place to be.  Great music, costumers lounge, and great selection of refreshments.  Overall, Mossy Nissan of El Cajon is by far the best car buying experienced I've had in all my years of car ownership!< /Text>

<Review>Unreal how long I have been having to wait just for a key to be made. My car was stolen from me and so when I got it back, I couldn't drive it Bc I didn't have a key. With Nissan keys , they have a chip so to be replaced you need to reset the system. They quoted me $120. 2 and half days later I still don't have my car and my quote went up $160. So now this process is taking 3 days and $280 to get my car back. RIDICULOUS SERVICE!< /Review>< Rating>

Worst service I had in my entire life! I made an appointment for service and tire change at 9:30 am, I was told that it was going to be ready at 12:30 pm and is already 3:20 and not ready, they didn’t even change the tire and I have to wait longer till they finish! Don’t bring your car here they’re slow and unfriendly.< /Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>I tagged along with a friend to go car shopping, and we ended up at Mossy El Cajon after only going to one other place. As soon as we walked on the lot, Manny walked right up to us and introduced himself. We explained that we were really just looking, and he stuck around to answer our questions anyway. My friend didnt have the best credit, and Manny explained to him the process, and that he was sure they would be able to finance him. It turns out that not only were they able to finance him, but they got him an amazing rate with a payment that fit his budget. They did not pressure him at all, but simply ran the numbers to show him what they could do for him. I have bought cars in the past, but this is by far the best dealership I have ever been to. My friend ended up buying a 2012 Nissan that day, and drove off in it within a couple of hours. While shopping with my friend, I became interested in a 2013 Altima. I ended up back at the lot 2 days later, and I also drove off the lot within a couple of hours. Manny helped us both out, and has gone out of his way to call us both to check up on us. They also have a kid friendly environment where they put a movie on for my 2 kids while we did all the paperwork to keep them from getting bored.This was by far the best car buying experience I have ever had. If you are looking for a new car, I would definitly recommend Manny, and the rest of the team at Mossy Nissan of El Cajon!</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Worked with Micah, David, and Anthony to find the right car for me in my price range. All were very professional and courteous.  David was super patient with me and explained all aspects of the cars I liked. Anthony gave me an awesome deal on my trade! And Micah in the financing department worked very hard to keep me in my payment range while still making sure I got all the add ons that I wanted. This is my fourth vehicle purchase with Mossy of el cajon. Always very happy with the customer service and car quality<//Review>

IDK how to start this it is going to be long story I'll try to make it shorter:
I received an email about building my next nissan and I was kinda excited and wanted to give it a try. So I went online and start building the Sentra Nismo which is a car I really liked when I first saw it. I finished building it and I looked at the price was something possible for me to get it I entered my information to get contacted. And after couple hours I received a call from Nissan regarding my request and the person who called me said it is not going to be available because I still have my leased Sentra from last year I will need to wait another year. So I said okay and that's really helped me to understand my situation. and then couple more days I received a V.I.P experience invitation from David Gunn (a Certified Internet Manager) and he offered me to go there to the dealership and to have:
(•   The Sentra here, ready for you to test drive
•   An on-site professional appraisal of your current vehicle by our Certified                    Management team
•   Processing of your online application ahead of time to expedite your time here and                    get you on the road in your new car quicker ).
So I said sweet why not let me go and check it out so I called to make an appointment with David Gunn today at 11:00 AM and I had to go there anyway to get my normal service for my current Sentra. I went there at 11:05 AM and David was not there they told me he had to take care of another customer. I worked for my entire life with customer service and if there is one thing I learn from that is to respect your time with your customers. Anyhow another sales person I believe his name was Isai he helped me out who was not even aware of why I am coming today he tried his best with me and I really appreciate his help a lot but there was so many different numbers and even the car itself it was not the one I was expecting or the one I build but I was really upset that the David who supposed to be the manager not takes care of his V.I.P customer. I mean I will never invite someone to be my V.I.P if I don't think I can handle his situation or at least give him what he was expecting. and I wasn't asking for the GTR it was just a Sentra for GOD sake. and they offered me with a pre-owned one not even a brand new car. I was really disappointment. and Isai wanted to his magic and help me get this Sentra and I told him from the beginning if you can get me the Nismo with the same deal I have with my Sentra then we can talk if you can't then please don't waste my time and your time because I can't pay anything more than $50 of what I am paying right now and I did my search online and I came up with the best deal that can fit my need but it is just shame that you couldn't take care of a V.I.P customer after you invited him in. My current Sentra I received the best deal ever in my life all thanks goes to Soran Pasha who gave me the best service and he became one of my dearest friends. I hope you see the pictures I included in my review. And I am sorry for the long story.</text>

My husband and I wanted to purchase a truck, we came here because of their reputation and the fact that I had to turn in my Nissan Leaf (2014) early because I had hit the mileage too soon and did not want to finish the lease.  So we brought in our Leased Leaf and our minivan as trade-ins for the Nissan truck we bought with David Gunn.  Through the negotiations I wanted to be able to turn in my Nissan Lease with no penalties as a good customer for purchasing a brand new 2017 truck.  This appeared to be part of the deal and we left both vehicles and drove away with our new Truck.  In June I received a phone call from the Nissan Leasing agency saying I owed them for several lease payments and they would go to collections within the week if they were not paid (the lease was up in May according to their paperwork but I left it with the dealership in March....)
I called the dealership and  spoke to Travis (Finance Manager)  and after some searching it turned out my Nissan Leaf was never "grounded" and none of the paperwork was completed so basically it was as if the car was still mine. Travis told me he would get Manny Jurado (our finance guy from the purchase) and David Gunn in the loop and ensure this was cleared up ASAP.  Nothing happened.  I have had to call them over and over only to receive promises of things being resolved when in reality all the phone calls and communication between the two companies has fallen on me.  When I finally got a hold of David Gunn after a promised phone call from Manny Jurado never came through David clearly had NO knowledge of anything that was going on. (this was over several weeks!)

To make matters worse they turned in the Leaf in June without giving me a call to see if I had the charger cable for the car which resulted in the Nissan leasing group sending me a bill for a missing Tool (no description and another phone call) for $896!!! Now after trying to drop off the cable which we had but did not know had not been turned in (major lack of communication) they turned us down and said we have to mail it back to Texas to get our record cleared.
I clearly remember the Manager that night we purchased the truck asking us if they will get a 5 star review....at the time we said yes but I am sure glad I waited....this team needs to get its act together and take care of their customers.  I am extremely disappointed with this bungled process and their lack of concern.  It's clear they only care about selling the cars and not about any issues they create for the customer after walking out that door.</review>

Service representative was Robb Workman 07/15/2017 930am I went up there to get a oil change and have them look at my car A/C i was up there for 4 hours with my daughter And finally they came to me and said it was my Compressor that needs to be replaced and it cost 1100+ So of course i didnt have the money, he then told me everything that recommended that i get done ( tires,flush fluids and 90k service) so i get back home witch is 10 miles away and i start looking over there paperwork i was given to see if they gave me a breakdown on the charges for the compressor and i find out my car has a blown head gasket! So im really pissed that he did not mention this to me and allowed me to drive off the lot with this problem, i could have had something horrible happen to me and my daughter driving home with a blown head gasket. Now i have to take the risk of driving all the way back out there with this problem. How could he have been soo careless and not have told me something soo BIG like this.

Don't trust them, my wife left a pair of very expensive glasses in the car by accident and the service manager Joe West did nothing about them coming up missing. He actually tried to say we lost them or misplaced them. Been a Nissan El Cajon customer since 1998, guess Mossy Nissan hires thieves and doesn't look out for their loyal customers.<//Text>

< Review>
I was in the waiting room for 4 hours for an oil change and tire rotation.  Also had to untwist the rear seat belt for the third time.  Service rep should have told me to go home and wait for the work to be done.< /Review>
