<text>I LOVE this place I get something from here about once a week when I'm walking around downtown WC. Their classic boba is great but I highly recommend the Danyi Tango if you want something not creamy and very refreshing! Their popcorn is delicious and the owners are so nice I would give this place more stars if I could< /text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmapID>0x808561ea8972f93d:0xe67086f91e45ed7</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

One of my favorite bubble tea places in the Bay Area! The desserts are truly delicious and have a full flavor. Some bubble tea places have really watered down or artificially flavored drinks. The staff is always kind and sweet! I really love this place!<//review>

This place has a nice vibe. I got the Vietnamese coffee-tea with boba and egg pudding and my wife got the Taro tea with boba. Their honey boba has a nice sweetness and softness too.

They have ice cream where they have the cold surface and fold ingredients into it, French macarons, boba/bubble tea, and flavored popcorn which I’m eating right now.

There’s not too much seating inside but we were able to sit once some other customers left.<//Text>

I stop by every time im in walnut creek. I love the rolled icecream. When it melts it has a pleasant texture, not filmy like regular icecream. Its a fun experience to watch as well. My all time favorite is the ferrero rocher but the red velvet is yummy too. Their boba is good, but a bit pricey compared to others and cornology (a popcorn company) is in the same room so it smells delectable inside.</text>

<review>Had some of the pan rolled ice cream & it was great! Definitely unique experience & worthwhile. Additionally, great customer service!! Let us try the tea before we bought and overall incredibly nice and gracious.

Overall, a fun new place worth the trip & we will be back.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipONk0RdHQKljm5YnBbXywcw_nbmp21dBljj54wa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

<Text>AMAZING! Their Boba tea float is incredible and such a nice change from every other bubble tea place. They also have popcorn at the entrance, and it is incredible, some of the best coated popcorn I've had (sweet without being sickening sweet and plenty of flavor). My husband who doesn't even like popcorn grabs for this too! A must try! We will be back ourselves, and with guests, as often as possible.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Would I come here again: If I’m really craving boba and am in the area.

Boba:

Peach Tea Boba - 3/5 - Standard faire in taste and quality compared to most boba drinks I’ve had in the past.  There wasn’t anything setting it apart from the rest.  However, it does appear to be one of the few options in the area.

Service: 3/5 - Average service from the cashiers.

Ambiance: 4/5 - I just grabbed and went.  It was a cute place to hang out but seating is a little limited.</Text>

Ice cream rolls!!   Depends on who you get to make the ice cream rolls.  We got 3 made. 1 by the girl, she did a great job. Cleaned the freeze surface really well.  Obviously a pro.   2 by a younger boy, must have been new...  He also did not clean the freezing surface very well between rolls and was not very good.<//Review>

Most amazing popcorn! Unusual varieties and combinations of flavors. The teas and drinks are some of the best available in town. Pride and attention to quality is evident. They have a rewards policy which is appealing for return customers.< /Text>

We ordered and waited about 10 mins...but worth the wait! The only concern my daughter ordered oreo cookies & it came with dried marshmallows *( like from Lucky Charms cereal)...not fresh white puffy ones. Try changing this. The staff is very nice though. 😋😊🤣</Text>

<text>Long wait for an interestingly made ice cream. I know that it is scraped, but having only one person on one freeze "stove" with one spatula is a bit of a stretch. Not sure how making money with sales volume is going to be achieved. Quality of the product was good though.
The flaw of this place is that the architecture of it is like a tunnel. What I mean is that there are tables in it that have no view because there are no windows that look onto the street.< /text><username>George Chi</username>< time>

My friends and I tried the rolled ice cream, crepes, rose and jasmine milk tea. They are all really good! The milk teas have real tea flavor, unlike other boba shops. They also said they use organic ingredients, thats a bonus for me. Will be back soon!< /review>< pics>

<Review>Delicious popcorn and super friendly staff. Sadly, I can no longer support them after seeing their "Non-GMO" label. Please consider removing this blanket label that spreads the misinformation that GMOs are bad things to be avoided, or specify exactly what unfavorable GMO practice you are avoiding as to not condemn the rest.</Review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x808561ea8972f93d:0xe67086f91e45ed7< /gmapID></record>

<text>The wings here are the best!! They are huge and the perfect amount of crispy and stay crispy even through takeout. They have a great variety of original sauces. Their burgers are awesome too! The owners are accommodating and they serve consistent quality. We don't mind going out of our way for the good stuff!</text>< Gmap_id>

Check this place out for some BOMB FUSION BURGERS, SANDWICHES and FRIES!! oh and they also have wings. Well run establishment with a severely innovative Chef, whose been running this joint for almost 8 years.  We ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala sandwich and, Indian Masala loaded fries... I also got the Twist Burger. Burger was juicy and satisfying, the flavors mind blowing. Chicken sammy has a layer of paneer too. try it to believe it!! 10/10 would recommend to blow someone's mind<//Text>

Amazing hidden gem! The owner cooks all the food fresh and is the friendliest guy around!

Hot Moroccan chicken is an incredible and unique take on the spicy chicken. The Mediterranean and twist caprese are excellent and make the shop very vegetarian friendly, but get them even if you're not vegetarian, they are so delicious. The Indian loaded fries (pictured) were amazing and creative. The fresh pomegranate really adds that pop of bright tartness to the complexity of the Indian spices.

Don't miss this true neighborhood spot!<//review>

<review>I'm glad we found this place just a short walk from our house. The food was made to order and all tasted great. The sweet potato fries were super crispy (even after walking back to our house) and the Hot Moroccan chicken sandwich was juicy with great flavor! We will be making this a recurring stop!

This place is awesome. Hole in the wall kinda place. The owner is super passionate and he's the one in the kitchen, which makes for originality. Fries were golden. Had some of his home made lemonade (he tries new things, most recent creation) and it was delicious! Check it out!!< /Review>

<date>1605227269222</date><review>A HIDDEN GEM! Owned by Chef Saad. We loved conversating with him and he was so funny! Already a 5 stars in my book!

Here's my food recommendations:
- The Hot Morrocan burger - this chicken sandwich is dipped in harissa sauce? how many restaurants do you know uses harissa sauce? the chicken was so tender, flavorful and had a slight kick of spice
- The Twist burger - MY FAVORITE!! All the ingredients just meshed so well together and I wanted more! Sweet and savory!
- wings - Saad told me not to order the basic sauces so he recommended the pear hoisin and the mumbo sauce! Next time, I will just leave it up to him because I was not disappointed at all! I need the sauces bottled up ASAP!

All of the food was so delicious. The service was quick and my sandwiches were piping hot. Prices are reasonable. Definitely a place I would recommend to family/coworkers/friends to, so they can try something they don't normally have. Definitely coming back!< /review>< pics>

<text>It's a nice small burger spot. My SD Burger flavor was overwhelmed by the sauce and 🥑 puree. I couldn't taste the burger. The fries were delicious though. Was about 30$ for 2 - burger/fries and 2 drinks. I feel it's a bit overpriced for the flavor/size of the meat. I really wanted to love this place. I will go back and try a boring (what they call it) burger to see if the flavor of the meat comes through better. I always give spots another chance if it isn't bad but not great.</text><Name>TJ Himes< /Name>< rate>

My girlfriend and I came here because we saw all the positive reviews about the owner being the one cooking, and he is! And might I say he is EXTREMELY passionate, Caring, and loves his customers and food. I got the SD burger and it was delicious, just the right amount of the all the toppings and as fresh as it gets. My girlfriend got the wings with Garlic parmesan sauce and we couldn't stop eating the sauce. All in all I'd tell anyone in San Diego to stop by for an amazing experience from an awesome guy.<//review>

<Review>Came in looking for wings and they were some of the best. The cashier was super friendly and the cook was also the owner! Good to support local businesses. We got the 10 piece wings half garlic parmesan and half creamy buffalo. Both were delicious but the creamy buffalo definitely stood ou . It also came with a side of fries they were very well seasoned. They also have burgers and loaded fries that looked goo . Will definitely be coming back to this  spot!<//Review></record>

They don't have a wide selection of chips, but you don't really need it. The sandwich was great. I got my bread toasted. The bread was soft and not stales I'd recommend it.< /text><gmap_id>0x80d954ef19076489:0xc697f5d3648f62c6</gmap_id>< Resp>

This place is hands down the best sandwich shop in the area. The owner is also the chef, it’s a one man show most of the time and he does amazing. He has all ingredients delivered daily and is passionate about his product. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a happy tummy.< /Text>

<Review>This place is great! I can't wait until they bottle their buffalo sauce! The owners were nice, accomadating and sweet. They told us they were expanding, and I am excited to visit again once that expansion happens. (I live a few hours away from this place). As well the menu was nice, and everything was the same price, except for sides. I highly recommend Twist, especially if you are having a wings craving.< /Review><rating>5<//rating>< Gmap_id>

The twist burger is a unique combination of flavors that blend to make one of the best burgers in North Park. A weekly food choice for me. Chicken sandwich with fries is another of my faves. No clever marketing or cute logos. They just let the food do the talking.</text>

<Resp>None<//Resp><Text>The food here was amazing. The Thai Asian sandwich was spectacular. After going just one time it is a new favorite. I hesitated slightly when I saw the outside of the shop but if you go into their tiny shop they will treat you well and feed you amazingly. The flavor is great and unlike many other shops the food portions are well worth the money spent. We bought the Thai sandwich and the Chipotle Sweet wings only to find we filled up on the sandwich and had to save the majority of the fries for later.

If you want a piece of delicious look no further than the Thai sandwich--so good.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Still the best burger I've had in San Diego, the Twist Burger with goat cheese.  Soooo good.  The owner really knows his stuff about marinating and cooking good meat, adding flavors and combinations, not just throwing a patty on the grill.  This place is a hidden gem in North Park. Thanks!! 😛< /text>

<Review>Didn't feel like going out so I hopped on grubhub and ordered delivery from here, grubhub is awesome but the extra charge for delivery from here not so much. Anyway I went with the Twist burger, Geisha wings and Moroccan fries. The burger was really good cooked perfectly and a great combination of flavors.  Geisha wings were tasty and you get a good sized portion as well.  Moroccan fries were good loved the spice, had just the right amount of heat.  Next time I'm feeling lazy and don't want to cook I'll probably order from here.<//Review>< date>

<review>Don't be fooled by apperiances

The food is the real deal, the burger was more gourmet than most burgers in more trendy joints in NP.

The owners are really nice and genuine people

<text>Tiny place with amazing food! My girlfriend and I decided to try this place on a friend's recommendation. When we first showed up, I wasn't impressed. It's a hole in the wall between a mexican food shop and a liquor store. The people inside were hustling. taking orders over the phone, working the grill, prepping food. They were very nice, but busy! The menu is small, but that's not a bad thing. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a twist burger. The food took a bit of time to make (maybe 15 minutes) but the results were amazing. The food was just awesome. the pulled pork sandwich was good sized and mouth watering. the Twist burger (I only had one bite because my GF didn't want to share) was juicy and topped with the perfect blend and amount of toppings. She said it's the best burger she's ever tasted. I'll definately be going back. Grab a to-go menu there and phone in your order to save some time.< /text><GmapID>0x80d954ef19076489:0xc697f5d3648f62c6<//GmapID>< Date>

I'm on a perennial quest for San Diego's best burger.  Crazee Burgers to Habit and Smash, I've tried them all.  Trump card in the local Burger Wars is Twitz, a hole-in-the-wall on a no-man's part of University Avenue sandwiched between Hillcrest and North Park.  It took me half-an-hour, and a "give-me-directions" to find this joint.  It was well worth the effort.  I arrived a little frustrated.  Dylan, the Maitre d', cashier and general manager quickly erased my frustration; he has passion for his crafted burgers and an accommodating friendliness that's  refreshing.  My opinion is that this is the best burger in San Diego.  If you've gotta better salvo in the burger wars, then I'd love to hear your recommendation.

< review>
Got into an accident and my insurance company had my car towed here. When I came go get my property out of my truck, that is still under my possession, I found my truck had been ransacked and my things had been stolen. All of my change in my car, about thirty bucks worth, my tools and who knows what else. Half of the remainder of my things were thrown in the bed of the truck and found other tools stashed in the truck for someone to come back and take. Asked the shaddy clerk yo speak with a manager but he refused to call anyone and said it was there procedure to take my possessions and bag them in the bed of the truck. Again this truck is in my name and my property and the clerk knew they stole my stuff. Filed a police report with Rancho Cordova PD, sounds like regular occurrences  here. Having my insurance pay for my stolen property. DO NOT HAVE YOUR CAR TOWED HERE<//review>

My storage started on Saturday!  So when I picked up the car on Monday there was already $80 storage from two days I couldn't even pick the car up on.  No logic, except to screw the customer.  I called to get an explanation and nobody cares.

Queue automated response saying they care about their customer experience and will  look into the situation....</Review>

<Review>I came in to inspect two vehicles I was going to bid on and the lovely lady at the front desk said I needed to pay 75 as a guest member just to inspect a vehicle I was going to bid on one time. And then she threw in a gym analogy saying you don't get to inside a gym for free, which is irrelevant, I'd need to pay upfront to checkout out the gym? Usually gyms offer a free 3 day trial.

It's ridiculous.

Sincerely, a lost costumer.<//Review>< UserId.>

I am so upset with these guys. I'm more upset with State Farm. I live 2 hours away from this tow yard. At first, State Farm said I could have my vehicle towed to any shop in town, but since there was no agent to inspect my vehicle in my area, due to "damages" they suggest it be towed to IAA for their convenience.

I picked up my vehicle today. Many things were taken from my vehicle, (personal belongings). My catalytic converter was stolen with oxygen sensors cut. My door latch was removed. Panels were damaged. Having a hard-time at the counter with these incompetent low-lives, I rather not deal with these douche-bags.

Since I retained my vehicle they took forever to get my car out to me. They used a forklift to transport the car.

Enough flaming. Time to look for a new car.<//Review>

<name>vladik antonovich</name><review>CAUTION! If your not right there at the Auction to inspect the car YOU SHOULDN’T BID ONLINE. Description of the vehicles is often purposely misleading. Pictures are taken in manner to hide truth and when iaai says “run and drive” they don’t always mean it. Recently purchased a car that said “run and drive” damage was to front bumper only. Well after they brought it out, the car had visible undercarriage damage! + oil pan busted in half. Anyone with eyes would see the cars isn’t going to run or drive. Had to buy another motor $$&$. IAAI needs to work on their integrity< /review></record></dataset><record>

And since I don't have the person nameThey cannot resolve the issue. Don't buy any cars from there, not a trustworthiness company. Copart never has these problems.<//Text>< Pics>

I loved this public auction but the problem was that it required money and I really don’t like to pay for anything until I know for sure that my investment will not be in vain. I prefer repokar more because it’s free.<//Review>

<Text>Awesome owners. I served them at Lucilles BBQ when I was a server and they were super respectful and tipped me unlike some people who would stiff me.
Anyways, the area is a little rough so they are skeptical of their clients hut they have WIGS, MAKEUP, CLOTHES, AND BASIC ACCESORIES.  My parents retired in this neighborhood and its and up and coming great old partnof Bakersfield< /Text>< time>

Refused to exchange black dickies work pants with an obvious factory defect as the pants hadn't been worn. Just wanted to exchange them. Not only did the man and woman refuse but also became verbally and then physically aggressive with me because I told them it was bad business and I was going to give bad reviews.. The woman actually approached me and attempted to grab the pants from me as I was leaving, claiming to want to take a picture. Totally inappropriate behaivor for a small buisness owner!  I change my recommendation to shop at this store!< /Text>

<resp>{'time': 1562127216237, 'text': 'We are sorry to hear about your recent experience. The pants that were brought in for an exchange were torn approximately 10 inches along the seam. They also looked as though they had been worn, due to being covered in dust and debris, despite the fact that they were purchased only four days prior. We thoroughly inspect items at the counter before we fold them and bag them for our customers. Our staff also has video evidence of this specific article of clothing being tried on before it was purchased in the store, and it is simply not possible that a 10 inch tear in the pants would go unnoticed by the customer and the employees. We are more than willing to exchange new items with factory defects. However, in this case, it was not a manufacture defect and was clearly damaged by the customer after the purchase. We cannot accommodate damages made to our products after purchase.'}< /resp><gmap_id>0x80ea6a2330370821:0xfa971512ad6be6ea<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good quality milk tea... thr portions are kinda small now. They changed to a slim cup even with a large size which cost $0.50cents more. It gets busy on the weekends... line is about 10 mins... weekdays not too busy about 3 mins wait..< /review>

Worst service ever met. Ordered milk black tea, got milk foam tea first time. Repeated my order and got a pure black tea second time. The staff threw my final order on the table without any apologies.< /review>

Typically you will see a long line, but don't let that turn you away from solid tea. The tea here is pretty good and they have a variety to offer. I tend to grab oolong here, but their black teas are also good. After shopping or after a movie a nice tea drink is good enough to end the day.</Review>

This  place has really good Boba. I recommend the jasmine milk tea with 70% sugar and regular ice. I would only recommend this once in a while because it can get a bit heavy. But overall the service is great.< /review>

Great FedEx location with amazing customer service. They’re taking all precautions necessary during the pandemic! They only allow a number of people in at a time and before you enter, they ask you if you have a FedEx account or a shipment label ready. If you don’t, they kindly provide one for you and a pen to fill it out before entering. Once you enter, they ask you to put your packages on the counter and step back, once you step back the employee steps forward and gets your package ready. There was a huge hand sanitizer bottle by the counter, everyone wore a mask, and social distancing was in place. While they prepared my shipments, they were loading a truck for delivery, nonstop work during this busy holiday season. They are requiring an ID when paying for a delivery, make sure to bring yours with you.< /text>

Customer service here is a step above literally anywhere else I have ever been a patron. They're so nice. Anyone posting less than 5 stars - was it FedEx that was less than 5 stars or just you as a person? Imma guess the latter.</Review>

<Text>I had to ship boxes  to Europe.  So I went to this FedEx office. I went in with the boxes, And they told me that they would take care of ( I was not allowed to wait) the shipment. I provided my account number, and I filled in the commercial invoices. The estimate of the shipment was 1300 USD.

The day after, I received a commercial invoice of 1865 USD. I checked the invoices they sent to me with my receipt, and they copy-pasted my signature to the commercial invoices without my permission.<//Text>< resp>

Had fantastic, friendly and speedy service here! As soon as I pulled up with my heavy packages, the man by the front door came right outside to help me take them in. Though it was very busy, all of the employees were smiling and working efficiently. I was taken care of promptly and had a great conversation with the employee who assisted me. Excellent location!!< /Text>

<Review>I came here to print resumes and get assistance with paper selection, right before an interview so I was extremely anxious and in a hurry. Lonnie G. (5550 Wilshire Blvd Location) quickly assisted me and made this experience overall VERY seamless and pleasant. His overall service and genuine ability to help me (and calm my pre-interview nerves) is very memorable. I am totally grateful for his assistance and cannot give him enough praise. I hope he gets the accolades he deserves for giving genuine and efficient experience to me.< /Review>< Pics>

<review>the girl at the entrance was very nice.
but manager Jonathan was very rude and didn't help me at all.
I recommend to ask for another manager to assist you if you wanna come to this office.<//review>< Pictures>

<Text>FedEx  service! Tom is knowledable and accommodating with rapid communication. I had a large (36x36") color image printed and it was ready in under an hour. I couldn't have asked for more. They have large format scanning as well which I will definitely be utilizing in the future. Very pleased to discover this gem right in my neighborhood.<//Text><user>108758105619727744247</user></record>

Each and every time I have stopped into this location the employees are always smiling, friendly, and knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  I am guessing that is because this location happens to have a great leader Yesenia.  On a scale of 1-10 this location is a definite 10+

I stopped by around 1am on Sunday 12/1/2019 to ship 5 boxes.  All of my boxes had some water damage so they all needed to be re-boxed.  I was helped by Lonnie and Brecia.  They were awesome, they worked together and had me out of there in 15-20 minutes flat.  They were both very upbeat and very nice, especially for being so early in the morning!   Their service exceeded all of my expectations not to mention the best service than any other FedEx Office that I have ever been to. If I’m around the area at night and need  to ship a package, I’ll go out of my way to stop there.  Happy Holidays!<//text>

<rate>5</rate><review>Here is where hiring the right employee pays off.  I needed to scan an oversized parcel (property) map, 26" x 18" and save it to a thumb drive.  I called FedEx Office and spoke to "Brandon," who explained they had one machine in the self-service area that could do the job.  I bicycled over, found the machine "out of service" and contacted "Brandon."  He politely came over, got the machine back in service and got me all set up to scan my map.  Scanning documents is a little expensive, $17.48 (just for scanning - no printing).  "Brandon," thank you for all your help and for being competent at what you're doing!<//review>< Pics>

I came here on a late Sunday night because my boyfriend had to print some last minute documents for work. These were hundreds of pages long. Unfortunately one of the printers wasn't printing the  document correctly, which we didn't notice until it started printing the second copy. Since the files were so huge they were pretty expensive. Fortunately, we explained the situation to one of the sales ssociates and he was super helpful in reprinting it for us and only charging for the correctly printed copies. He was really friendly and relieved some stress off the situation. The printer issue is still frustrating, but the customer service is great!</Text>

<rate>1</rate><text>Went in there this morning to make color copies. Had to be logged onto computer extra time and was double charged for print outs. When I addressed this with counter person, I was told no refund, before she gave me a look  and then decided she could process refund after I persisted. Then she said I could only get a portion refunded and then said she could do other one separately. her communication skills were terrible. Then manager comes and says we are done and kicks me out of store. I have seen this same manager harass two black customers at computer stations weeks ago when one left his note pad at computer while using rest room. The daytime manager has awful people skills and is flat out incompetent. Go to the UPS store down the block. The store's 2.4 rating is a reflection of her ability to run a store and the culture she sets for staff.</text><time>1563380997038<//time><pictures>None<//pictures>< user_id>

For some reason there is always a line, always slow service. Be prepared to wait up to 15 minutes just to drop a package off and get a receipt no matter the time of day. Parking in building is free for 15 minutes but bring ticket with you just in case they’re extra slow and need to validate.< /Review>

<text>Awful.

Yesterday I called to place an order. Someone mumbled from the other end. I asked him to please speak into the phone. He copped an attitude for the remainder of our conversation. Told him what I'd like to order and he placed me on hold for 5 minutes, where I got to repeatedly listen to a 10 second ad for their services. It became excruciating so I hung up, called back and another mumbler answered. This time female. Also with an attitude. I asked her to please transfer me to whomever could help me with my order. She asked, "Who's calling?" I said, "A customer." She put me on hold for a moment and then an articulate cheerful young woman came on the line. Finally! Someone who would save me from this already bitter experience.

She broke down the prices (it's overpriced) but I was in a hurry then told me to e-mail my file to the store and someone would contact me within 20 minutes.

That never happened. No one ever contacted me.

I will never. Ever. Try to give this store my money again.

I know there must be nice, competent people who work here. I just never had the chance to deal with any of them.

I'm now trying the Vine St. location. Fingers crossed.<//text><GmapID>0x80c2b91f875c86ab:0x84c460a7f4ca8a05< /GmapID>< response>

I have never been more insulted than I have dealing with these people. Seriously. I had a couple of basic questions about how I can create a self addressed prepaid envelope here, the staff pointed me to the printer and glared at me if I dared ask another question. I will write to the FedEx HQ customer service.
Really hope the FedEx does something with these people. Very humiliating experience, for no fault of mine.< /Text>

Awful, and very slow service!!! Avoid this location, or maybe all the FedEx in general. They have many people working, but only 2 helping the customers. I came to pick up a package, had little time, but 15 min wasn’t enough! Left without it. Unbelievable! And got a ticket, no parking around at this time either. Just horrible all around!</review>

<text>Worst FedEx Location. No store at location. Horrible customer service on phone.

Called to verify address as the listed address is no longer in existence. The lady on the phone told me they arent at that location and it's not her responsibility to make sure the correct address is posted.

The horrible condescending attitude made me hang up, and walk across the street to UPS, who were kind and caring.

Nice fail FedEx, will be tweeting about this.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Went in at 6:30am on Dec 5, 2017. the young man, didn't catch his name but he is an African American, was very helpful. He attended me right as I walked in. He offered to help carry a package to my car, which definitely shows he goes above and beyond of his work duties. I'm one happy customer.

Overall if you going to go to Fed ex. Come in the morning and let this gentleman help you.< /text>

<Review>Horrible service. This store got the worst customer service. Asked front desk attendants for help, and the answer was they have to finish scanning the boxes!! After awaiting for more than 15 minuets without being helped, one of them came in and I explained to her how my issue is time sensitive and need to get a photo printed into 2*2 size asap. She said her computer cannot do that and I have to make an order. Told her just tell me what i need to do to get this done. Her reply also includes she cannot do it because she has other stuff to get done!! However, in the middle of my frustration “Sarah” retired nurse, was an angel came into my way and helped me out and she did a great job. Very sweetheart, tried to get me relaxed. She was a bless.< /Review>< Pictures>

The only good thing about this location is that it's open 24/7. I have waited a bit with writing this review and when the second time it happens to me, then i decided this place, or a specific lady there, deserves 1 star. Kiana is one of the most rudest people I've encountered in any FedEx locations. She tried to upsell my packages EVERY time when I drop something off, always want me to add money to put some air bubbles in order to "secure" the items inside. Give me a break, at UPS it never happens, with other FedEx people, never happens. She always answer with attitude as you were an idiot. For example for those who think my packages were packed incorrectly - she even rejected an unattached unopened package that was shipped by Walmart like this. She wanted to open it and add "stuff" to "secure" it. Come on... find another job, not around people... BEWARE!<//Text>

< Review>
This Fedex location has lots of computer units that you can use. I believe these are newer units as they are faster now.  There are a number of photocopiers you can use yourself. The staff are generally helpful. However, if you need to print letters using mail merge, i suggest you need to go to Staples which is just on the corner. The reason being is that there PCs won't allow you to do it yourself. You can have it done on their full printing service but you are at mercy of how helpful, knowledgeable and accomodating their staff and if they are not doing orders which were placed before you. Parking is only street parking. This is accessible to public transportation.< /Review>

<Review>I actually like it because this particular FedEx is 24hr. I needed something printed n ready very early in the morning,  all other shops opened closer to noon so this FedEx's hours really saved my ass. I ordered at midnight and picked up my prints at 8am. I will definitely come back.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Wonderful employees!

I've gone to this location twice (once to pick up a package and once for a poster sized print).  On both occasions, the employees have been incredibly helpful.  I was very satisfied with the quality of my 36" x 48" black and white poster sized print.<//Review>

<Text>Stood in line for 20 mins as the line began to pile up behind me almost out the door. We all waited while one employee sat with his back turned to the line packing boxes. I asked DAVID if he could help and he said “ he said that he doesn’t work at that location and is just helping for the day”. When another employee noticed the line they rushed to help, then magically DAVID decided to help out with the line. Which is funny because I thought DAVID wasn’t able to but instead it appears as if he was just being lazy and rude. Fedex please hire employees that value their job and have good customer service skills. VERY DISAPPOINTED</Text>< Gmap_id>

Hit or miss on quality of staff.  Was recently provided misleading information about packaging requirements in order to upsell packaging and shipping services.  After rejecting the upsell and going to another fedex location, no such issue.< /text>

<rate>1<//rate><review>They had us wait for an hour to take care of one customer who had to repackage everything. It seems like they could have taken other customers while the other customer was repackaging her stuff, but they made us wait. A lady in line with me was just picking up a package, and the waiting made her late for work, and, eventually, she gave up and left.  I get that they're understaffed, but it was an incredibly inefficient use of time. I've never had to wait an hour just for them to get through one person's order. To top it off, the staff was rude. If I didn't have to overnight a shipment, I would have left.< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Just had to wait while a manager (I assume as this woman was wearing a dress and not uniform) was giving training discussions and negative feedback to the worker who was the only person to help the two waiting customers. She made it clear to him "she was about to leave for the day" so clearly felt holding up helping two waiting customers was more valuable. It also seemed like a conversation that should have happened not in the public in front of two customers and I felt bad for the guy she was talking to in front of all of us. Additionally, another worker walked by while this was happening and she made no effort to help or stop that conversation to say we were waiting to her manager, in fact, she purposely kept looking down at her phone as she walked by to go into the back. Bad service all around. Go somewhere else for your fedex needs!< /text><time>1501963830511< /time><Resp>None< /Resp><pictures>None< /pictures><userid>109032469356785537892</userid>< GmapID>

<Resp>None< /Resp><review>Do not go here. This Fedex Office location is not only the worst Print & Ship Center I have ever been to, it is the least efficient and most frustrating printing and shipping option in the Los Angeles metropolitan area. While impressively large, this Fedex Office location is consistently understaffed and painfully slow. While you might expect a 24 hour location such as this one to be sparsely staffed in the middle of the night, this one is understaffed all day, every day.

Whether looking to do enterprise-level printing and shipping or just copy a document, I highly suggest you take your business elsewhere or suffer the consequences of this location's unacceptably slow service.< /review></record>

Omg. I don't know which is worst the DMV or this place. The employees have sense of urgency. I waited about 45 minutes to drop off a pre label pre packaged item. When I asked for help to print out a label. The lady said somebody would assist me. No one EVER came. I had to figure it out, kinda. I came on a Friday at 3pm on 12/14. In general this place is always like this. Never ever again am I purchasing something that comes through FedEx. This is a whole other level of insanity. Then when I finally get to the front that same girl tells me I can't mail the package because its USPS and I tell her. It says on the label OR FedEx. They need to get it together at least during the holidays< /Text>

<Review>Worst Fed Ex Center Ever - makes you purchase items/packaging to ship, does not like you using random fed ex free packaging. Lack of customer service. Fed Ex will ship depending on the waybill not the packaging.
This incident is 2 separate times; with years apart, so they are never going to change their ways.
I will no longer use this (Kinkos/Fed Ex Printing) place of business, go to Office Depot down the street, they are willing to help and have free packaging.<//Review>< date>

If you plan on shipping anything in a box big or small the best thing to do would be to purchase your box and shipping tape there especially if you need to ship a big box. That way when you bring it back up there to ship all you'll have to do is pay for it. If you're shipping something smaller you should bring whatever it is you need to ship up there and they'll pack it up for you. Ultimately if your stuff isnt in a shipping box sealed with shipping tape you'll be expected to re-box everything before you send it.<//Review>

If you get your job in the night before, it will not be ready when they say it will.  Then the next time, when you try to do it a couple of days before you need it (so it'll actually be done), they say, "Oh, we printed that and threw it away, because you didn't come and pick it up."  They forget to notify you when your job is ready.  They suck. Steer clear.  Poor customer service. You've been warned.  Chimps could run a better printing service. I miss Kinkos.<//text>

<review>I went to this FedEx yesterday because I was on my way to a rare Sunday meeting. I made 2 copies totaling 39 cents. This morning when I was checking my account, there was a $15.00 hold put on there from them. I've used those self-serve printing machines several times and I've never had a hold put on my card. There was no sign saying those machines would do that. I called this morning and spoke to one of their employees and he first said that it was my bank. WRONG. I called the fraud department immediately because I thought someone had gotten my card number. So I told him that. Then he said there is a sign stating they put holds on your card. WRONG! Then he said it was a company-wide policy. WRONG! I filed a complaint with FedEx and the person I spoke with said no, she had never heard of any such policy. I also called another FedEx and spoke with someone and asked if their copiers were programmed to put holds on your card and he had no idea what I was talking about and said no as well. What if a person needed a copy and all they had was a few dollars on their credit or debit card? They should not now nor ever put $15.00 holds on people's cards for copies that cost a few cents. This was completely unacceptable and this practice needs to stop.< /review>< rating>

We value your service which is why we waste your time. Who says the DMV is the most inefficient branch of government? Here at FedEx we pride ourselves in being a corporate business run with the efficiency of government bureacracy.<//review>

I've been shipping from this location for over 8 years now...the employees aren't bad, for the most part they are helpful and attentive.  The main issue I have is with the fedex computers that somehow always seem to be running 'slowly', so if you have a package that has to get somewhere the next day and you are there after 5pm, good luck because it may not make it!  You may stand in line only to be told sorry too late (our computers are slow).  Ugh c'mon Fedex can't you do something about this(??), this has been going on for months and moths and months (probably years!).  Twice I had to race over the the Robertson location (later cutoff) after standing in the Wilshire location line (forever), thankfully I made it both times but... it was so close!</Text>

Stay away from this fed ex. I tried to do a drop and ship, they told me it would be about 60 dollars. So I gave them my info and they said they'd contact be before they bill it and ship, they pack it then call 2 hours later saying it would be 200 dollars. When I declined because no way could it cost that much to ship a little synth along with quoting me around 60 dollars in store, they said I sill have to pay 24 dollars for them packing it. I figured that wasn't a big deal basically paying 24 dollars for their packing supplies.. However when I got there it was in this gigantic box 5 times bigger than the item I wanted to ship too big to even fit in my car, I had to leave the box. They then charged me 35 dollars instead of the 24 they told me over the phone for packaging. I took my synth and bubble wrap and got out of there as fast as I could, went to get an old box from a music store that is 5 times smaller and am using UPS from now on. I don't know if the workers are mentally challenged or Fed Ex is training the to lie and run a scam operation, either way they lost a long time customer.< /text>

<Text>I've tried to get my headshots printed here. Their photo printers are from the last century. It took me 45 minutes to print 5 copies and they came out looking terrible. Afterwards, the printer ate my card and I needed someone to open the damn thing and get it out. The staff looks overworked and doesn't care but how could I blame them? Fedex won't even supply them with decent printers. That was a stressful experience.</Text>< date>

<Text>Save yourself a ton of time and just go to Staples just a couple blocks away.  Fed Ex is near impossible to print at and it seems none of their employees know how to actually help with any of the machines they have there.  I wasted 50 mins there today trying to print a .pdf that they kept telling me "must be corrupt."  Then I went over to Staples and was printing 2 mins after walking in the door.</Text>< pictures>

I needed help today to call a taxi as I forgot my phone and was on foot with only a credit card. The 2 clerks were unhelpful and uncaring and said they could not call me a taxi.  There was one customer in the entire store so it was not an issue of being busy.  I was disappointed that the 2 clerks working did not have more human compassion to help.<//Review>

You couldn’t pay me a million dollars to come back to this pathetic sh*tshow of an excuse for a “Fedex”. Zero out of ten people would recommend this place.</review>

This is the worst fedex I have been to. Always the printers run out of paper. Why you put printers if there is no PAPER for it to print?< /Review>

<text>The Hispanic guy (possibly a manager) working in the shipping department has the worst attitude, he refused to ship my package due to a bulge on the side of the box, he offered to repack it for $25 , not including shipping. what a rip of.

This place sucks so hard! Like if the employees are going to just ignore you then at least print some signs to instruct customers which desk handles what or have people pull numbers! Shouldn’t take 25min to drop off a package when there are 3 employees and 2 customers.< /review>

I have to agree with the other reviewer,  very time I visit I leave frustrated due to the unfriendly service and long waits.  Today I spent 30 minutes trying to get a fedex envelope.<//text>

Went in at 4am to print a huge class project onto black foam board and Julio helped me through it. I was so nervous, it wasn't gonna turn out right but he was very patient and even helped me print a few test copies. 5/5 for Julio -- I got an A!<//text>

< Review>
The employee name Jose seems to be ignorant.
He refused to accept the package addressed to Fort Irwin, declared they don't accep the package to military installation.
His supervisor later retracted his statement, offered an apology.< /Review>

<text>I’ve came here a couple times to get my routine check-ups and the entire staff never fails to make me feel as comfortable as possible. Dr. Kann is exceptional at what she does. Kimberli also always has a positive attitude and is very friendly and we always have a great conversation when I see her. Thank you ladies for all that you do!</text><resp>None< /resp>< name>

This is my first time visit to FPA clinic in El Cajon. The staff is very nice and friendly. Dr Mann, Karen is very professional and gives time to patients, she answers  any question or concern in details. I recommend them to my friends and family!< /Text>

1st appointment and planning went well. Everyone was so nice and understanding and considerate. Only down fall for me was constantly giving my insurance info and my ssn# when given prior. Even after the appointment everything on my health and well being went well and per discussed. Totally happy with it all. Thanks again.< /Text>

<Text>FPA Women’s Health Center in El Cajon (which is open by the way!) has been somewhat of an answer to my prayers in recent years. How many women say “I just wish I could find a gynecologist I feel comfortable with”... ...and that doesn’t have a month-long waiting list. The office always can get me an appointment in a super reasonable amount of time. Dr Mann is so personable and makes me feel super taken care of. She was so precise and skilled with my procedure. The office is great, everyone is so nice. Couldn’t recommend more!< /Text><resp>None<//resp></record>

Friendly staff always! I’ve been to this clinic a few times and I am always greeted with a smile and they answer all my questions. It is also pretty easy to make an appointment.  I’ve recommended this place to many of my friends because the wait is never too long. Always in and out which is also a plus!<//Text>

<rate>5<//rate><Text>I had done my research, but was still very nervous about the (pretty famously painful) insertion of the Paragard IUD. I won’t lie, the insertion was painful, but it was clear that the doctor was experienced and was working as quickly as possible, explaining what she was doing and how it would feel step by step. The whole thing was over in a matter of minutes, and while I did experience some lightheadedness, all of the staff were very attentive and happy to give me as much time as I needed to just sit and relax until I felt comfortable enough to drive. They brought me water and even offered me some food if I needed it.  I should also mention that the ladies at the front desk also squeezed in a pap that I was due for and a STD screen while I was there.
Overall a great experience with a very attentive and caring staff.< /Text>< Pics>

I’ve had the most amazing experiences here at  Family planning! If you think about it they’re only open on Tuesdays so yes you may have to wait a little while but let me tell you, it’s well worth it. The doctor she’s amazing attentive she’s caring & most of all she is as pure & down to earth as a woman can be.< /Text>

I will not recommend this clinic. I called and scheduled an appointment for 1:25 pm. I arrived early to check in at 1:13. The receptionist said that the baby is not allowed so I called my mother-in-law to watch the baby for me. I come back to the office at 1:27 and asked the receptionist if the doctor can see me in 15 mins because I have 2 babies (3weeks old baby and 22 month old) in the car at the parking lot with my mother-in-law and I need to be out of here as soon as possible. The receptionist said I can't be seen in 15 mins and the doctor will probably see me between an hour to an hour and half. I asked her why is it like that? I have an appointment with you guys at 1:25 and the receptionist said "well there's a lot of patient before you and we are currently busy". Well if that's how this office works,I hope you don't make appointment. This office doesn't value their patients time, energy and effort just to be seen on time. Basically you want your patient to be on time but make them wait, for hours (that's very rude). The appointment is pointless. I'm pretty sure if your patient is late you will suggest for reschedule.<//review>

First visit took 3 hours just to get called in from the waiting room, i was literally there all day. The follow up visit took so long that they couldn't finish the appointment that day, I needed to reschedule just to get on birth control, needless to say I followed up with planned parenthood instead...< /text>

<review>There is always a wait, as this costco is usually always busy. I would knock a star off for the wait, but it's not their fault they are busy. The food always comes out great and hot!<//review><userid>118172730871243167379<//userid><resp>None</resp></record></dataset><record>

Very good place with awesome services and good quality of items. You could find everything here like vegetables to clothes and even electronics like tv and mobile phones. There is food court which has mouth watering food items</review>

Didn't go to the food court went to Costco to do my normal shopping on 2/29/20
Went at 9:30 parking lot was already full the lines at the registers were each 15 people deep. I think the media has people panicking about being able to get supplies</text>

<Text>I called in to order 2 Pizza's for pick up at 11 a.m. I was told by the Manager that they weren't able to fulfill my request because "they had a lot of orders" and that I can pick it up at 10:30 a.m. I take the city bus and inst able to make it at the time she asked, I specifically requested for an hour out of my phone call to make sure I get there on time. How can  you not ACCOMMODATE such a small order?  I'm over it, but I want people to know that they REFUSE TO go with what time is convenient for you but make it convenient for them.< /Text><user_name>Trisha Villagomez</user_name></record>

Says on the sign in the food court "call-in orders welcome!". Went to call in a whole pizza before leaving so I wouldn't have to wait so long in the food court, called in 4-5 times letting it ring for over 2 minutes each time and nobody picked up. Drove to Costco to place an order in person and waited at the register for over 15 minutes to have my order placed as the employees continued to walk past knowing we've been waiting. Took over an hour to get my food AFTER the order was placed. Customers swarming the counter in the pick up line couldn't even get up there to get my order. NEVER GOING TO COSTCO FOOD COURT AGAIN.</Text>

<Text>It is a decent place to get food. But it is not a fast way to get food. With their new ordering system, they lose track of orders, and even simple orders made at the register can take better than 20 min. I am very disappointed. First they get rid of the Polish dog, and now they make ordering inefficient. Too bad.< /Text><Rate>3< /Rate></record>

<review>It’s well-known that most items on you he menu taste great and are super cheap, but the service is pretty terrible. Either some of the order takers are mute and lacking some muscle co trip in their faces or they’d rather be anywhere else. Perhaps I’m getting what I’m paying for, but a “hello” should be standard anywhere, regardless of price. Let’s go Costco.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response><gmapID>0x808fe89ddb969a33:0xc0f216463a772d12</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Awful service! Called in order for pizza after attempting to call 10-15 times with no answer. Called administrative office to get through...3 times. First two times was transferred to food court with no answer. 3rd call they took my name and number to the food court to call me back. I actually received a call back (very surprisingly). FINALLY got to place my pizza order. Was told pick up time of 1245 but had to pay before they could give them to me. I showed up, paid and waited for my 1245 time. Name never called so at 1255 I went up and asked, only to be told they would put them in the oven now that I paid!! Are you kidding! What was the point of calling in my order! No one seemed to care either. Rude service and waste of time.< /Text><name>Jeannette Tyler</name>< rating>

<text>The server/order take was mean & sarcastic.
I ordered 2pizzas/whole at the register & the guy said 15mins. So I waited 15mins before following up. This old server went "well who makes the pizza? You should ask us instead.< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

We had a very bad experience with San Diego Carpet Repair and with Leslie.  We wanted him to put our 2 yr old carpet back in place after we had removed part of it for some subfloor repair work.  He came out and finished in 20 minutes, left a HUGE mess of un-vacummed fibers, many lumps in the carpet and badly repaired door seam.  He said it was because it wasn't rolled correctly and the seam wasn't properly cut in the first place.  There were many reasons given about how it was removed incorrectly but nothing offered to repair those incorrections the right way in the first place.  There were large, floating bubbles in the carpet and it was obvious it needed to be stretched further.  So we called to have it repaired again, the person answering said they wanted us to be 'happy' and sent Leslie back out even though we asked for someone better.  He spent another 25 minutes and at a first glance when he left (and we gave him more money just to be nice), it looked ok.  But, when we came to put the furniture back, we noticed that the carpet was cut too short on one side of the wall with visible subfloor, carpet padding staples used on the outside of our carpet all around (which should NEVER be used), unstretched areas with bubbles still apparent and no offer to redo the badly repaired door seam.  More excuses were given when we called, like saying the tack strips were old which is why they STAPLED our new carpet and mentioned again that it wasn't cut well at the seam.  What they didn't do was tell us what needed to be done to fully correct these issues in the first place and how much more, if anything, it would cost to do it right in the first place.  They stopped responding to any calls after that and didn't give us any money back.  We had to call another EXPERIENCED person to come out to fix all the issues and ended up paying more than double for a job that should have been done correctly in the first place.  Needless to say, we are very disappointed and very unhappy.< /text>

<text>Leslie is amazing!  He is thorough, knows exactly what is needed and wastes no time getting the job done perfectly. I had a bit of a mess thanks to a new cat that was brought into my home. You would never know now that I had any kind of a problem. I would recommend this company and this particular employee to anybody looking for carpet repair services. In addition they were not overpriced at all. He exceeded expectations and they will be the first company I will call should I need services in the future.</text><Rate>5</Rate>< response>

Leslie was timely, thorough and friendly! Great job, good conversation and genuinely loves what he does. He repaired high traffic doorways for me where the carpet started pulling away from the strip and he fixed all the areas that needed to be addressed. Will be using him for carpet cleaning as well. Thanks again!< /Review>

< Review>
Our cats tore up carpeting in the doorways of our bedrooms.  I contacted 5-7 carpet repair companies to get quotes, and these guys were the friendliest, had the most positive reviews on Yelp, and, gave the best quote.  Leslie Langston was the repairman who came - promptly - to do the work.  He was awesome - did a perfect job, was super fast and friendly.  And stuck to the quote.  I highly recommend these guys, and will certainly call them again!< /Review>

I went to Home Depot and they were absolutely no help, and I called Stanley Steamers who turned me away immediately. Feeling hopeless, I finally found this service which was not only amazing but also very professional. In addition to pristine customer service, he also went ahead and tended to other spots that needed touch ups.
Will definitely be the only carpet cleaning service I use from here on and out.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Resp>{'time': 1513987637145, 'text': 'Thanks Louise!'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Text>My pet essentially ruined a rental and what I thought was irreparable. I called San Diego Carpet Repair on the morning of the damage and they came SAME DAY ready to fix the damage. They were efficient, quick and the fairest price of all the companies I quoted. I will be using them again for a carpet cleaning when it's time to move! They saved my deposit and my dog's stay within the family! Lol!! **HIGHLY RECOMMEND**</Text>< pics>

Best carpet dyeing ever! been struggling about a stain that was impossible to remove, I was going to pay 700 to the leasing office for carpet replacement!!!  But the guy came here charged only 200, and fixed every stained spots seen. Wish I could give 10 stars if google didn't limit the maximum stars I could give to 5.< /review>

<review>My dog got locked in the room by accident while i was at work. When i got home i saw that (rocky my dog) had destroyed the carpet near the doorway entrance. I rent this home and I put down a $3,000 deposit afraid that I was going to lose my deposit. I contacted San Diego carpet repair and carpet dying and they came out and did a AMAZING JOB! I can't even tell that it ever HAPPENED! I am so thankful that I will now be able to get my full deposit back. if you need any carpets repaired I would highly recommend this company great price reasonable and excellent work!<//review>< pictures>

Food is phenomenal the service is superb I am sad that they will be moving in the next couple of months. I really enjoy heading over during my lunch break quiet time and good eats. They play good music that is at a good level that you can still hear any conversation and the music.</Review>

I admire this place! They prepare first-cleass meals, their menu is varied, The cook in that restaurant is a professional, I like very much eating all their dishes. The dishes are consistently good, the service towards the clients  is helpful. I often eat in this place and I not even once was discontended. Highly recommended.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>To look at it, you would think Sunny's Sushi & Grill is a little hole-in-the-wall greasy spoon. But oh how wrong appearances can be. What it lacks in ambiance, it makes up for in friendly service and lovingly prepared, really delicious Japanese food at very affordable prices. A perfect example of the adage, "Don't judge a book by its cover".</review>< date>

Tasty sushi, tasty tempura, tasty egg rolls, tasty salad dressing, and cold beer! What more can you ask for? Oh, fast, friendly service? They have that too! Come try this place for lunch--you won't be disappointed. Love this place. Our friends love this place. Their gyoza is delicious! They have a really decent happy hour if you love Sapporo. Their bento boxes can't be bear. Best California roll in Downey, imo. The service is great if they aren't slammed. Chicken Katsu is the bomb too! If you like tea, try their hot jasmine tea - pretty yummy!< /Text>

This place is authentic  Your greeting will be very kind. It looks and feels very casual. Don't be fooled. The food will make you think you are in a high dollar metropolitan establishment.</review>

<Review>First time and walked out with out ordering  anything I cannot believe there's a restaurant who's not willing to switch or swap things from one dish to the other!!
that's exactly what this restaurant did!!
it's too hard to believe that there's someone open for business that is not willing to work things out with their customers even for a very simple thing
That I simply had to walk out of the restaurant

<review>Call before you go.

I went before they opened. They opened almost on time. That day, they had a catering order. So as soon as I walk in, I am advised that I can only order rolls. No bentos, soups, meat, or the like. So I ended up ordering 3 rolls for just shy of $40. A pricey lunch for me.

Rice was moist. I was happy with the portion of avocado slices on my Caterpiller roll. The Washington roll had clean salmon. The last roll was a simple California roll, so pretty hard to mess that up.

Service was mostly attentive (ordering to go). But the inability to plan ahead knowing you have a large catering order and not being able to stock enough food before you even open says a lot to me. Additionally, it took about 35 to 40 minutes to get my order. With a 30 minute lunch time, I cant afford to come here again.

Overall I give it 3 stars for food quality hindered by slow prep time and inability to purchase enough food supplies for the daily lunch crowd. I doubt I would return unless I was really hurting for a nearby Japanese food fix.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I can’t say enough good things about this place. The staff are friendly, helpful and personable. Dr Levine is the one who helped me. He is the best.  He was very thorough and explained things well. Though I was a bit nervous, he showed care and helped me to feel more at ease.  He took time to explain things and to listen.

I would recommend Beach Cities ENT’s to any and everybody. You won’t be disappointed.</text>< Pics>

<text>What can I say, Dr. Levine is the best.  He, along with his cadre, cured my decade-long sinusitis.  I am now seeing Dr. Levine for loud, open mouth, keep you awake-all-night snoring.

Dr. Levine is still the best.  I had a tonsillectomy today as a 53 year old with chronic, loud open mouth, keep your wife awake all night snoring.  The surgery went amazing, which is not a surprise.

Surgery scheduler Wanda is equally amazing as she was very patient w my scheduling issues during these trying times.

Its obvious to me that Dr. Levine and his team made a commitment to excellence a long time ago and have maintained a steady course during the voyage.

The review by Dr Levine was brief. He checked my mouth and ears. Removed some wax from my ears and apparently didn't find anything notable but never used the diagnosis vertigo or any other diagnosis. The doctor did say I needed some form of therapy. I believe.
So now I am waiting to hear from Dazja. That is what I recall.  No prescriptions were offered.
I have since developed coughing with phlegm and have had some diarrhea issues.< /Text>

I had my first appointment at South Bay ENTS this week. The office sent text reminders for my appointment and even  included a Google maps traffic link. The staff and my new doctor listened to my questions and concerns. We now have a plan to move forward, a great relief.</Text>

<Review>Dr. Levine told me the condition of my throat, ears, & nostrils as he examined them. He went over options available to me and let me choose based on the results of my exam. He explained what I can do at home if I ever get sinus pressure. (so I save on office visit costs) He is a warm & caring doctor. At the end of my visit, he asked if I had any questions. How thorough! Then he wished me an enjoyable sunny day.<//Review>< Response>

<Text>My visit to this ENT facility was excellent. I arrived a few minutes early for my appointment but was surprised to be taken in without any waiting time. The nurse took down the details of my nasal issues and then the doctor came in right away. He gave me quite a thorough exam and then explained what was going on with me. He recommended that no prescription or surgery be done because the issue would self resolve in time.
The office was very clean and pleasant. For a change, this was one doctor visit that I enjoyed.< /Text></record>

< Review>
I really appreciate Dr. Levine’s straightforward approach to patient care. In my first appointment he addressed the issues that I had raised and set about a very clear treatment. In my follow up appointment, Dr. Livine was very thorough in making sure everything was resolved, which I will say is absolutely true because I feel so much better. I particularly appreciate that I was not strung out over a period of office visits to get the issue resolved, as some doctors I have gone to in the past have done. You can be sure the next time I need to see an ENT, Dr. Livine will be getting my call!</Review>

<review>Very professional and I was able to obtain an appointment immediately. Facility very clean. They have very good COVID health awareness. Dr Brett Levine is my doctor. I wouldn’t trade him for no other nose ears throat specialist. He is top in his profession. The office assistants are very friendly and professional also. I would highly recommend them.

I returned on 2/23/21 I had very hard ear wax sitting on top of my ear drum. It couldn’t be flushed out it was so hard. Dr Levine was able to get it out thank God. It hurt because it was so deep in my ear and hard. It had nothing to do with him but all to do with my hard ear wax. He is just an awesome ear specialist. He very compassionate about his patients. It bothered him that it was hurting me but I wanted it out and asked him to proceed rather using wax softener and coming back. I high recommend him and his staff

5/25/21 I had a follow up visit with Dr. Levine. Previously he gave me instructions on how to maintain the hard wax my ears develop. I did exactly as instructed and my ears was totally clear. I was very happy and pleased with my results. Once again Dr. Levine is someone I very highly recommend.🥰<//review><Pics>None</Pics></record>

The experience is and was exactly everything I would want from an ENT professional. I recommend Dr. Rafii a million times over to anyone looking for an ENT provider because coming here increased my quality of life ten fold. This is the one doctor I trust and know is qualified.

I started receiving care with Dr. Rafi for several years now when I had issues as a teen from everything tonsil stones to many ear issues. Through the years I had to switch insurance providers, so now pay out of pocket to see this specialist. I cannot put a price on the benefits of seeing this provider and words do no justice to the quality of care and attentiveness of work that I have received here.

This is a truly amazing office down to the receptionist quality of service and I look forward to going here in the future years as well.</Text>

COVID made things go slowly, but end results are AMAZING and life changing for me. God bless him and all the kind staff in the office. Thanks AGAIN Dr. Sesi. A very happy ….

<text>I love Dr. Sesi. He is smart, thorough, listens, explains, spends time, and is so kind, funny, relaxed and absolutely professional. Dr Sesi listened well, respected my experience, and ordered all appropriate tests.
His staff is great. Kind courteous, capable, quick, organized and efficient. And thorough. I have never been in a more well run office. Waiting time is consistently minimal. Patients are treated shortly after arrival and it must be due to proper scheduling, and not overbooking, because the doctor does nor rush his appointments at all. The staff also swiftly got referral for and scheduled MRI, and immediately ordered a return appnt post MRI without me having to reach out. Wonderful. Will stick with Dr Sesi when needed for sure. 😊<//text>< pics>

Praise the Lord for leading me to Dr Raffi
to perform my thyroid surgery! Dr.Raffi's extensive background and training is impressive and equips him with sterling surgical skills that do not disappoint.
From my first visit I was impressed with the fact that he discerned that a nodule in my thyroid needed to be removed immediately because of it's size.The urgency for me to have surgery regarding the size of this nodule had been overlooked by another doctor ,including the radiologist . Dr.Raffi's astute medical expertise and diagnosis was paramount to my then condition  and my present recovery..
From the onset , Dr.Raffi was a very gracious and keen listener to my  concerns and fear about my vocal chords being damaged. I also came to appreciate the fact that he was also very direct and honest about the risks to the surgery because of the fact that the nodule was pressing on my trachea.
Throughout the course of my treatment Dr. Raffi was so very kind ,caring and compassionate and it really helped me to feel confident in trusting him. His inner confidence as a Surgeon put me at total ease about my surgery .
My 4 hour surgery was successful and my vocal chords were protected!
I am so blessed to have had Dr Raffi as my surgeon.He is gifted ! God truly used him as a vessel for my healing and restoration and I am forever grateful.< /Text>

<review>Dr. Brett Levine is my Hero.  During an office visit for profuse bloody nose bleeds, my wife became unresponsive and Dr. Levine took immediate action and was able to revive her.  He called for the paramedics to take her to ER.  Dr. Levine seen her in the Hospital and called regularly to see how she was doing.  Dr. Levine, then set up two appointments a week apart to see how she was doing.  Dr. Levine is a great and caring Doctor.  THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DID FOR MY WIFE PATRICIA.

I was impressed with the level of care provided by Dr. Levine and his staff who were very thorough when interviewing me about my chronic symptoms of sinusitis and ear pain. He gave me practical and effective advice, as well as a new antibiotic. I felt better within a day or two, which was a huge relief!< /Text>

Dr. Sesi was able to get me in the same day, find the source of my issues, and I had a prescription that evening that has really helped.  Love the no nonsense and patient centric approach taken by this practice!</review>

< Review>
Monday was my first appointment and I was really impressed.  Everyone was super friendly.  Dr. Rafii was so knowledgeable.  All the suggestions and recommendations he gave me helped me by the second day. I am NOT an easy patient due to chronic allergies.
I am always hesitant to go to any doctor that my insurance recommends since I have an HMO plan. However,  this office is definitely a 5 star office!<//Review>

My wife received the service.  They were very punctual; she reported that she felt safe at this time of COVID.  Dr. Raffi was great; very caring about her  situation; got hearing test and results on the spot.   She would recommend this practice.< /Review>

< Review>
From the moment I walked in the door I was greeted and felt welcomed ( even though I was 15 min late because I went to the wrong building)  the staff is friendly and professional.   Dr. Sesi is the 3rd ENT I have seen for an ongoing ear problem, and thank goodness I did not give up.  He is awesome! very professional, through, kind and informative and did not rush through my appointment.  He asked a lot of questions and ruled out potential causes of my problem with a through exam and a hearing test.  ( no other doctor I had seen prior offered this or had the equipment or audiologist to do so).   Got to the root of the problem(which wasn’t my ear after all)  and gave me options to treat my issue.
I would highly recommend Dr. Sesi and his office.   He truly cares about his patience and it shows.< /Review>

<user_name>Kathy Ryyth<//user_name><Rate>3</Rate><review>I had not visited this office or doctor before. I found the doctor to be extremely clinical and not at all personable. I came in primarily for an ear that itched. He did a quick exam, explained absolutely nothing, sent me to another person to do a hearing test, then told me I had a hearing deficit and ordered an MRI without any discussion about what it was for.
Both my daughter and I were given medications and told to use it one way, but after they were filled the prescription directions were completely different. I tried to call the office and was put on hold for so long, I hung up!< /review><user>104830814188954978924</user>< GmapID>

This was my first time as a patient @ Beach Cities ENT!
Dr. Brett Levine was the doctor I saw he was very nice & cordial, he came in introduced himself which a lot of doctors aren’t even doing anymore and  had a bit of a sense of humor as well!  He made me feel at ease and that he really cared about my issues. Because when I presented I was quite concerned about my mouth and lips!</review>

<Review>I’m always so impressed with Dr. Rafii. He is very gentle, caring and knowledgeable which is exactly what I want during a doctor’s visit. Also, it doesn’t hurt to know that he graduated from Stanford Medical School. He always answers all my questions and goes above and beyond to make me feel comfortable.

As for Dr. Dao, she has amazing hand skills and a master of her craft. Couldn’t be more pleased with my visit!

I came on time for my appointment and only waited a few minutes before being called in. The staff was very friendly and efficient. Highly recommend Beach Cities ENTS!< /Review>< pics>

DR.Sesi is an amazing ENT ! I have been a patient of his for years following a tonsillectomy. He is a wonderful surgeon with great bedside manners and he makes sure you are well taken care of. I highly recommend him to anyone in need of an ENT(:</text>

I have been seeing Dr. Maher Sesi for years. I found him when I had HMO insurance, and I have happily continued with his medical care even though I have PPO insurance now. I can pick any doctor to go to, but I wouldn’t seek care anywhere else. He has always given me his upmost attention and superb medical care! He stays on schedule, and getting an appointment soon has never been an issue.
If your looking for an excellent doctor...look no further!
YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!<//Review>

Dr. Rafii and his team (especially Andrea) are amazing. Ever since I started seeing him about two years ago when I had an issue with my tongue they have gone out of their way to make me comfortable. For the past 18 months I've been having on again/off again sinus headaches and earlier in the month I had a sinuplasty. Prior to the procedure they explained what would happen, the potential side affects and the results of a positive outcome - which I have had. Dr. Raffi called a few days after the procedure for a wellness check - I had an in office visit yesterday and will have a final follow up visit at the end of the month. They are all caring, professional and I highly recommend this practice.<//review>

I saw Dr. Brett Levine for first time as I felt like my ears were plugged with wax that I couldn't seem to get rid of on my own, and was very impressed and happy that he  was able to vacuum the excess wax.
I definitely  recommend him and will return to see him if needed in the future. He was very professional and I felt like he really cared about my problem and he asked about what medications I was taking and any other heaIth issues I had. I did not feel rushed during appointment,  (which I dislike)
Overall, very pleased.</Text>

Dr. Levine is amazing. He did my son’s tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy when he was just three years old. The surgery made a huge difference!! His sleep apnea stopped and his hearing returned to normal with the ear tubes. My son is now 15. He surfs a ton which causes him to have ear infections from time to time. Last month, a treatment of antibiotics and drops prescribed by a regular physician didn’t alleviate pain from his ears . So I made an appointment with Dr. Levine, and he was able to determine that it wasn’t an ear infection but a sinus infection that was putting pressure on his ears. I’m so happy we’re treating the root of the issue. Dr. Levine is thorough with an excellent bedside manner. I will take my children to him for any ENT needs. Sincerely, Mindy<//text>

Dr. Rafii was very thorough and listened to my concerns and the female staff blond sorry didn't get your name took my info inside the exam room was very pleasant and filled the rest on pc.

Receptionist was pleasant and it was very quick to see dr Rafii .

They send text and phone messages when your appointment is coming soon.

But very hard to reach them on the phone sometimes, keeps ringing and ringing .

Otherwise I like the whole experience of visiting Beach Cities ENT.<//Text>

This was my first visit to Beach Cities ENTS.  I was thoroughly impressed with every staff member I dealt with.  Dr. Ashley Dao was an extremely dedicated professional.  She answered all my questions, about my imbalance problems, and patiently explained the probable causes of my issues.  I also had concerns about my hearing aids.  I was immediately scheduled for a hearing test and then an on-site audiologist will address any hearing aid adjustments.  Again, I could not be more pleased with the outcome of this appointment.   Thank you Beach Cities ENTS and Dr. Ashley Dao.< /review>

Saw Dr. Dao for the first time. I was completely impressed with her knowledge and manner. Gave me all the options for treatment and did not push one way or another. Great visit!</review>

Dr Sesi was very good and able to diagnose a difficult condition. Not a typical stuffy Dr. Speaks with you like a normal person with words you can understand.<//Text>

Dr. Sesi and his staff were wonderful!  Kay, his nurse was very friendly and Dr. Sesi was patient, very thorough in his explanations,  and made sure that all of our questions were answered.  Everyone at the front desk was also very friendly and helpful. We had a great experience and recommended this practice to anyone looking for a great ENT doctor and staff.< /Text>

Always a pleasure to visit Dr. SESI.  First time ever that a Dr.'s office gave me traffic conditions right before my appt.  Dr. SESI goes the extra mile to check my tongue, throat, and neck when I am there for ear cleanse.  Consistently A+.  Personable, professional, and thorough.

My son has special sensory needs, and Dr. Rafii was wonderful with him from the very first meeting. After years of being evaluated by pediatricians and allergists for a chronic cough that would just not go away and would hinder daily activities, we were referred to Dr. Rafii for evaluation. My son ended up needing a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy last year, which we were certainly nervous about. I wish I could describe that first moment you are watching your child running around and playing ball and does not have to stop to catch his breath or cough after just a couple minutes. It is sheer bliss and relief. That is what Dr. Rafii gave to us after treating my son. I would absolutely recommend Dr. Rafii to anyone looking for an ENT, and we are so blessed that he was brought into our lives. We will forever be grateful for his outstanding care and expertise ❤️</review>< Pictures>

< Review>
It's rare to call your doctor in these "covid-days" and be able to drop by to see him on short notice and get such a warm welcome.  Dr. Sesi is no only a leading professional in the ENT category, he has not lost his human touch and ability to spend time with patients and make them feel better overall. I feel very lucky to be able to have him as a doctor. His staff is also efficient and they extend the same warm and professional welcome.</Review>

<Review>Dr Sessi at Beach Cities ENTS has vast experience that I benefited from.  I was prescribed antibiotics from my primary Dr, for what at that time was  diagnosed  as swollen lymph nodes on the right side of my neck. DR Sessi was treating me for the removal of a lipoma, when he noticed the swelling in my lymph nodes.  Thru his quick actions, I had a series of test, on the lymphnodes and they were found to be cancerous. Because of Dr Sessi's diagnosis, my cancer was caught, removed, and thru surgery, radiation and chemotherapy treatments, I write this text today, with no cancer in my lymph nodes.  Thank you Dr Sessi for saving my life!!.< /Review></record>

<Review>Beach Cities ENTS, is a great place to see Doctors for your throat, the entire staff, including all doctors are polite and to the point discussions with the Patients. My Dr. Rafi is superb discussing and analyzing the symptoms and guiding me accordingly. I appreciate their services, and I personally and behalf of my family I thank their entire staff and to my initial Dr. Levin and finally to Dr. Rafi.</Review>< pictures>

Dr Dao is AWESOME!!! I tried to set up telehealth new patient appt with Dr Dao, but mom didn't know how to set up & use the link, so Dr Dao called my mom for a phone consult free of charge because she just wanted to help my mom. (Of course I called her office later to make sure the appt was processed bc I definitely didn't want to take advantage of her goodwill.)

Dr Dao genuinely cares for the wellbeing of her patients.  Our 1st conference call was cut short bc Dr Dao had a surgery patient waiting, but despite being fully booked, Dr found time to call my mom back a 2nd time to make sure all my mom's questions were answered to her satisfaction.

Dr Dao has a very warm, caring and calming voice, super knowledgeable about all ENT issues, saw a couple photos and immediately diagnosed the problem. (My mom had multiple issues!) Dr Dao was BEYOND patient with my mom, listening to all her questions, never rushing, never interrupting.  Dr Dao is exceptionally skilled at handling & interacting with elderly/senior patients.  My mom is definitely in the "difficult patient" category (generally combative and disagreeable), but in the end Dr Dao even won over my mom!

My mom is super paranoid about new medications, so Dr Dao ran down a list of various treatment options (both over the counter & Rx drugs), explaining how each type of med worked.  Brilliant strategy bc my mom felt she was in control of her meds since she could choose which meds to use.

I'm so glad Dr Dao accepts telehealth patients, and so grateful she was available.  She is everything you would hope for and expect in a physician and more.  I would highly recommend her, and plan to use her for my family if I ever need an ENT.</Text>

< Review>
My visit with Dr. Sesi began with the intake on the part of his office staff and it was efficient and painless. I waited a short time and was escorted ito a treatment room and was seen by Dr. Sesi, who, asked appropriate questions about my reason for the visit, and examined the area about which I was complaining, obtained confirmatory tests. He explained, clearly, the cause of my distress and recommended severly options. All this in a professional, timely, warm manner.< /Review>

Really poor experience in this office. Front desk never greeted. I came here during a desperate moment while seeing my son with non stop nose bleeds. This was the only place that had an opening now i see why. PA keeme diagnosed my son with a “sinus infection” gave antibiotics. Bleeding was still there went back after antibiotics, and according to PA “infection” was still there and prescribed 2nd round of antibiotics, which my son denied to take. Plus did a test for an upper respiratory infection which came back normal, additional fees. keep in mind that I’m paying cash for every visit, no ins. I then gave PA a call, mentioned her what was the situation, recommended my son Claritin, that maybe it was allergies. My son took the allergy med, which led us to er due to him having an allergy reaction, more money out of pocket there. Thank god I was able to find a Great ENT, there was never a sinus infection, and informed me about the diagnose..< /review>

Doctor was not able to help me with my problem but she referred me to specialist that could. Great service from checking in to checking out.< /Text>

<Text>Had a poor experience with this office. Came here to treat persistent vertigo relating to inner ear infection/fluid in ear. Ignored bad reviews for this office because the dizziness I was experiencing was very debilitating and I was desperate to find a solution.

Unfortunately, working with this office was a time consuming, frustrating experience. Received conflicting diagnoses, then after many visits was ultimately brushed off and told I probably have a virus. Kemi was very nice and did her best to help, but Dr. Rafii was not sympathetic, did not offer any other courses of exploration or treatment, and told me to wait it out and come back in a month if it persists. This is a condition that makes it so you can’t get out of bed each day- just miserable. Not great to hear “wait it out, bye”.

Went to another doctor and received much better care and a solution. Unfortunately, I do not recommend this office.< /Text>< date>

Dr. Brett Levine is such a great doctor.

After some different treatments, it was determined that I needed a septoplasty, endoscopic sinus surgery, as well as have a legion removed from the base of my tongue.

I had them done all at once. I healed so quickly and feel better than I ever have in my life. I highly recommend you give him a try. I will be with him as long as he is practicing and close enough to drive to.

The ONE thing I would say could be improved is the front office, but it's not even enough to dock him a star. They have been confused about co-pays, given me wrong information, and even wrong appointment times compared to what they had down. This isn't every visit, and we are talking about many over the course of a couple years. If you can be patient with them, Dr. Levine is absolutely worth it.

He deserves your trust and why not give him a try?< /review>
