< Review>
Eddie (and his Dad) are the absolute BEST! They treat you like Family, are very honest and dependable. I love that I never feel pressured to have services done on my cars that are not needed. I've had my cars serviced at the dealerships, where I've paid double the price for half the professionalism and pleasantries. Thanks so much for always going the extra mile, Eddie and Papa!</Review>

Recently took my 04 G35 to get a tune up. They also discovered I needed new brakes, rotors and shocks. They did the work and the car runs better then ever.</review>

< review>
I am always skeptical about taking my car in for work. I now have a regular mechanic but he doesn’t do transmission services.  Steve and Eddie made the experience easy and comfortable for me. They are honest and helpful plus they are in walking distance from my home. Eddie is very professional and accommodating, which is rare in customer service these days. Thanks so much!< /review>

Overpricing for labor! Quote one intial price and will you go to pick up your car another higher amount is quoted. They never called to let me know it was going to cost more. I also returned to have them finish a part of the job they missed but the guy was sick and I never got whatever else was to be done by that guy that was supoosedly sick. They did not give me all the old parts they took off of my car either. It's so hard to find honest automotive workers.<//Text>

By far the best auto repair company that I have been to.
Eddie and Steve are very professional and work with your budget.
They offer credit if you don't have the funds to pay to work out a payment plan.
I use to be a customer of Eddie when he was at American Tire Depot for 6 years and I decided to follow Eddie because of his superb customer service and knowledge.
I definitely recommend Park's Transmission to all my family and friends.< /review>

These guys are great. First they were substantially cheaper than anywhere else I could find. Second they had my truck up and running in three days. They put in a new transmission and did some front end work. Super friendly and very professional.< /text>

It's hard to find an honest Mechanic but I believe I just found one.
I take my car in for them to check out my check engine light and I was surprised that they didn't charge me for the diagnostic.
Second they told me to replace my gas cap and that it will fix my problem.
I had them order the cap and its been 2 weeks and no light and the car is running very good.
Thank you Eddie for your honesty,  communication and  fair prices.
I will definitely be back from now on. I am now a lifetime customer of Park's Transmission thanks to Eddie.< /text>

<name>eduardo gomez</name><review>Best local mechanic in town. Eddie and Steve are very honest and competitive with their prices.
I thought I needed to replace my brakes do to them feeling spongy and upon inspection Eddie told me that the brakes were fine and that all I needed to do is change the brake fluid.
They definitely will get all my future buisness.
Thanks Eddie and Steve.<//review><response>None</response></record></dataset><record>

<text>I took my vehicle to two other spots. One told me that they weren't sure what was wrong with it. Another said my vehicle a 1990 was too old for them to work on. I came here hesitant and skeptical of mom and pop auto repair spots like this because I've been treated badly in the past. Eddie and the team over at Parks Transmissions took care of me. Not only did they fix my vehicle's problem but treated me with courtesy, communicated with me well (I always felt like I knew what was going on with my vehicle), and made me want to come back. They are knowledgeable and are looking to build good relationships with customers for the future. I appreciate businesses like this and am happy to support them like they've supported me. I would highly recommend this place!</text>< pictures>

I was referred to this shop from Ken's Automotive in Huntington Beach. Steve and his crew did a GREAT job! They replaced my transmission in a timely bases. The cost he quoted me was unbelievable, so I shopped 2 other shops and found that his prices couldn't be touched. If I lived in the  LB area I would definitely take my car there again. Thanks Steve...Keep up the great work!<//Text>

This shop changed my BMW 528i transmission 5 years ago and never had an issue till I sold the car. I returned recently with a BMW 328i and they did an immaculate tune up, service and oil change. Both services were cheaper than quotes from other shops around.  I would recommend this to family.</Review>

<text>in 2010-2010 got a cheap quote for some engine work once the car was towed there the price went from $3500 for a re-built engine to me needing a transmission, catalytic converter, a new clutch sensors and accessory parts at the tune of almost$11,000! the engine blew 6 months later after a routine oil change. They tried to blame the cause on the oil change. Lied and had the engine covered under warranty and it did the same exact thing early 2012. by then they didn't want to look at the car again unless I paid them more money. Not to mention I had a senior citizen and my disabled kid in the car with me on a hot day in the mountains. From the time they checked my car I was in and out of thier shop. they forgot to change the rear engine seal had to go back. The dash fell down on my laps cause they didn't connect it back. The engine light (if the car would start) would be on to this day! and their only reason for that was it takes my car some time ( a few thousand miles) before it gets use to the new engine lol the car issues was everybody's fault but theirs.  I wonder how they feel they're fixing my car for free when I have 401K withdrawal receipts that show I paid them? $11,000.00 and didn't get to drive the car 2yrs straight! Furthermore isn't a warranty a guarantee of service for the time of the warranty. Meaning they're saying I agree my engine will "at least" last you a year with proper maintenance? well how do you explain I never got to a year? Another note: Who puts in a brand new engine and doesn't check the intake manifold which regulates oil flow to the engine? PARKS TRANSMISSION! without changing the intake manifold whatever warranty I did have was doomed anyways! That engine didn't stand a chance with a hole in my intake manifold. Oh, I found out the real reason I needed 2 engine in less than 2yrs from a AAA certified mechanic where I now live once the car broke down and Parks Transmission would've look at it or fix it for me for free (LOL) I paid and had it properly diagnosed and now I'm taking that evidence with me to court and I'm gonna sue their pants off! What kind of person would leave a woman with a disabled kid and no other means of transportation stranded for over a year in a rural area and limited public transportation?...Parks Transmission I begged them to help me told them I had a disabled kid and no other car and they could care less. Now after a year of trying to reason with them I'm suing. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE WITH YOUR CARS depending on how they feel it what you'll get<//text>< Pictures>

The transmission fluid change for my 03 maxima was $100, but they overfilled it, & now a few months later, my transmission is slipping. I need to get some drained out.<//Text>

Mr. Park gave me a free diagnosis and when he figured out what the problem was, he was still way below what I had been quoted in other places. He delivered within two days. Thanks Mr. Park</Review>

I visit this spot a lot since I work nearby. I must say their customer service is always great and they keep the spot clean all the time. Rates are reasonable and they serve large portions.< /text>

Our food did not taste authentic by any means at all. It was so bad that both the Curry and the Lemongrass Beef dish's gravy, looked grey and tasted like it was made from a gravy powder packet.
The rice did not taste fresh. In fact, if I didn't know any better, I would say the rice was cooked several days prior to my visit, and then microwaved. Their Pho was mediocre. I was told AFTER my Pho was presented to me, that there was no lime. For me, lime is a key component to a great tasting Pho soup. All of the items I ordered, the portion sizes were SMALL. If you ever had spring rolls from any other restaurant, imagine being served half of the size of the one you've eaten before. Every item on the menu was overpriced.
No drinks listed on the menu. Once our drinks were brought to us, we were never asked again if we wanted a refill.
If I had to say anything positive at all about this place, it would be that the lady seemed nice, despite her checking on us to see if we needed refills. I consider myself to be pretty easy going. I never complain and I am never that person to knit pick my food. Sadly, this takes the cake. This is the WORST restaurant food I have ever had in my life!
Yeah, I said it! Don't believe me, try it for yourself.... but don't say I didn't warn yah! lol<//text><Time>1592351355239<//Time><rating>1</rating><pics>None<//pics>< gmap_id>

<Review>The food is great! My husband loves it and the soup is his favorite. I liked the pot stickers best! The rice was a bit minty. The wait felt unexpected and unnecessary.<//Review>< time>

<text>I have to write something because some of the comments are not fair to the establishment.
The restaurant seems to be clean to me. Nothing to brag about though.
How about the food?
Well, they taste pretty good. I've had better.I've eaten phone plenty of time in my life. Photo soup is normally clear broth, not at this place. There are many factors that masseuse the soup to be that way.  One way occurs when they add more water to the existing soup. They adjust the taste afterward but they cannot get rid of the cloudy broth.
How about the service?
Well, in their culture, they are super friendly. It might not look good the American culture though. However, they took almost 30 minutes to come out with a bowl of soup.

They perhaps serve more American people than oriental people. That's probably why they some nasty comments. They should learn from the restaurant on Madison and Sunrise. They serve the same kind of people.<//text><pics>None</pics>< resp>

Great phó! & delicious vietnamese pancake.  Always fast and friendly service. Plenty of variety on the menu. Pretty regular here because of its location, fair prices, and reliability in quality. Today had one of their vermicelli noodle bowl/dish and enjoyed it quite a bit.<//review>

I don't usually write reviews but this was a horrible experience. The staff or owners were very pleasant but doesn't matter when it takes an hour to the minute to get your food. It was busy but not that busy. They forgot to take our order after we were seated, forgot our appetizers and drinks.<//Review>

The takeout wait during the busy times of day can be a little long for food, but that's because it is truly made to order with fresh ingredients, and the quality can be seen in the taste and portion sizes, so just call ahead. Service is always friendly,  and the dining space is clean and comfortable. We are so lucky to have such a great littlecspot down the street.<//Review></record>

Not only is the food outstanding but it was extremely affordable; however, they have recently hiked up the prices by an average of $2 a dish!! Is it still worth it? YES! Only we won't be able to frequent the establishment as often as we would like 😕< /text>

<Text>I went here for over a year and could not praise it more. I never really knew what pho was until I had it in San Fran. I came here because I saw good reviews and it exceeded my expectations by 100%. I continued going there every week on and off. First off the women who works there is very nice. Secondly, their chicken is amazing! I just had Pho today at another restaurant and I do not know what it is about other Pho places but their chicken always tastes like leftover chicken from Thanksgiving that is three days old. TM noodle's chicken is outstanding! Plus the broth is 100. Best PHO in Sacramento!<//Text>< UserId.>

<Rate>1</Rate><Review>Went for lunch with my wife and infant son (typical 1 hour lunch) and was seated upon arriving. There were only two other parties that had already gotten their food. The server (older Asian lady) who was the only one serving took 5 minutes to bring us glasses of water, she didn't ask if we were ready to order which we already knew what we wanted and instead she came back after another 5 minutes. I ordered the pho which for a pho place should already have broth ready and my wife ordered ramen noodles, and for appetizers I only ordered the spring roll. That being said we sat and conversed for about 10 more minutes, I asked the server if the noodles would be done as I was on my lunch break, she said yes, I also asked if the spring rolls we're almost ready she also said yes. 10 more minutes go by and we get the spring rolls that were not as appetizing  since they were so small, and this point I ask again is the noodles  coming out soon, I was running short on time during my lunch she said yes. 45 minutes into my lunch and after 30 minutes of waiting for simple pho, she brings out a very sad amount of noodles and bland looking broth, after becoming irritated from the wait I notice that none of the meat I ordered were not in my soup. I decided it was time to go since I had only 15 minutes to rush back to work and after paying it was more like 10. The server didn't apologize for the lack of service or the fact that it took 30 minutes for pho when we were the only family left that ordered. First and last time we come to this place.

Clean, friendly employees, tasty food that my kids devoured.  They loved the pineapple teriyaki chicken bowls with rice and zucchini.  They have a flat screen TV inside if you want to watch sports or the news but we sat outside on the patio.  Easy to order at the counter and pay.  We will definitely be coming back!< /Review>< UserId.>

<Text>Great food, huge portions and fantastic price. I met the owner during my visit and he asked my opinion on cash register location. I've been here many times and will continue to come due to the friendly atmosphere and always tasty food. I highly recommend getting the chicken plate with the macaroni salad and spicy sauce. Incredible!< /Text>< Pictures>

Place was completely empty when we visit on a Saturday afternoon. Bought a Groupon to give this place a try and the staff were nice and helpful. We got the chicken and beef bowl with island rice, the protein were very good but not digging the rice which was made with coconut milk and black beans, slightly on the sweet side.
We also got the pulled pork, which tasted quite bland to me, if not for the sauces.<//review>

Food is good if you eat food with less spice. Quantity was great. Very plain taste. Macaroni on the side was not tasty.< /Text>

<Review>This place has excellent blackened shrimp bowls. I've been trying to figure out how they make them forever. Their pulled pork sandwich is also to die for. I've been to both the Simi and Agoura locations and the food is consistently good, although I'd say the atmosphere in the Simi one is a little more inviting. Still, I'll never stick my nose up at a meal from this place.< /Review><Rate>5< /Rate>< Time>

There was beans, also said no rice in the Amigo Burrito, there was rice. The food was not hot and the chips we're stale. The Albondigus soup was blane. Don't know what's happened there. But really dissatisfied.< /Review>< GmapID>

I love this place. The food is fresh and healthy. The street tacos are tasty, and their meatball soup makes a great lunch for work the next day. The people are friendly and helpful, something I really appreciate because I have food allergies.< /text>

<Review>My wife and I travel for work. We have been enjoying Taco Tuesday ‘s for awhile now. If you’re traveling anywhere close to the high desert then take a short trip along old Route 66. Stop in Helendale for the best carnitas tacos that I have ever had. Everything we have ordered for the 4 short months was exceptional. The service was awesome. I will miss this place the most when we leave this area for our next assignment.<//Review>< Pictures>

Second time eating there and the food was improperly prepared again but with the added bonus of poor flavor and severe sickness after eating. I should have listened to the locals and stayed away.< /Review>

< Review>
I have been eating here since Los Amigos opened. The quality has steadily slipped over the last few months. We've provided feedback to the staff and no one seems genuine about what we have to say. Today was the last and final time we will ever eat at Los Amigos. Every single item ordered did not match the ingredients listed on the menu. I asked for extra sides of sour cream and green sauce, was charged for them, and then never received them. The "burritos" were nothing more than canned re fried beans drowning in sauce with a tortilla somewhere in the mix. Unappetizing to look at and even worse to try to eat. When I called to politely inquire about the missing sides and awful burritos, I was argumentatively told that they were "busy" and were unable to do anything about the inedible food. Roughly $40 dollars, zero customer service, and general apathy towards legitimate concerns means I can not recommend Los Amigos nor will I eat there ever again. I will also not patron the owner's other restaurants and establishments in the community including Fratelli's Pizzeria due to the shameful lack of customer service. I wish this was the one and only time experiencing this that prompted me to post this review, however, this was the final straw. Two stars only because your food and customer service used to be something my family and I looked forward to.<//Review>

<text>I love this place and I eat there at least twice a week. The staff is always friendly and provide great service. The fried ice cream is to die for along with the carnitas quesadilla, carnitas crunchy tacos and the cheese enchiladas! Oh and don't forget the beans!! ❤️❤️<//text><pics>None< /pics><date>1493864009086<//date>< gmapID>

I've become addicted to their shredded chicken quesadilla supreme. Always a monster portion and the chicken is tender and juicy. Love it.< /Text>

<Text>I only stopped here to get a beer and use the restroom, but the place was clean, bathroom was clean, and the air comfortable. The lady who helped me could have been a little friendlier. She wasn't rude, but didn't go out of her way to be super either, so one star off for that.
I did not eat here.</Text>< Pictures>

I have been getting the carne asada burrito here for years. I love the way the meat is marinated,  good size portions and very yummy.  I find getting the burrito in the morning has a better tast than in the afternoon.  Either way your cant go wrong.  Service is fast and friendly.  Lunch time is packed so plan ahead.<//Text>

I ordered a taco salad from this restaurant and was very specific NO GUAC ... it even said it on the receipt and when I called the lady agreed and said the cook must have made a mistake .... which is ok I truly understand people make mistakes, however they did not even offer to remake it ... I will never order from here again<//review>

<Text>terrible place, I asked for a box with me, instead, the woman at the checkout placed the tacos in the plastic tray with her bare hands (attention with her hands without gloves touched the food) and poured the remnants of Jamaica while shifting the tube from the drink from one glass to another again with her bare hands behind where the lips are, disgusting!< /Text>< Pics>

Food is taco shop good. Prices are very reasonable. Service is friendly and efficient, restaurant is clean, and they're willing to make slight changes to combos for free. I eat here regularly and will continue to so.< /review>

Loved it!!! As a native Mexican I can tell when a restaurant produces authentic and flavorful Mexican food. This place is very affordable and clean. I highly recommend the chorizo and eggs plate. Also asada tacos are a must have.<//Text>

I spent over $60 here and I come here repeatably. And I accidently dropped my drink on the way out . I spoke to the "manager" and he said "too bad that's your fault". The stupid foam cups are less than $1. It wouldn't have hurt their business to give it to me. And the cook and cashier lady laughed at me. Its not like I spent $5 I spent OVER $60.  The food is alright but horrible customer service & they don't even carry GREEN SALSA ! After this experience I will NEVER go back . I rather go to Taco Bell< /text>

<Review>Nasty food!! Very disappointed in this taco shop . Prices are way to high for the quality of the food. Not at all authentic mexican food, tables and seats were sticky only 1 refill an you have to ask for everything you need it's not sitting out for you to grab it's behind the counter. All an all very disappointed will not be coming back again .<//Review><Rating>1< /Rating>< user>

<text>The worst chorizo egg burrito I've ever had in fact I ate here a year ago and I had a carne asada burrito and even that was terrible how do you mess up either of those items. My girl ordered the chili relleno and they put a generic process slice of cheese on top of it, disgusting! I don't like McDonald's but McDonald's is across the street and recommended over this place.</text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

< Review>
Great place to get some gear or purchase jerseys and soccer stuff (gifts and so on)....  prices are good- average- no real big savings compared to other soccer stores. Service was decent; staff is friendly but limited when it gets really busy. Store may seem a bit crowded but it's because they have a large inventory on the floor and it is a small store.  Either way you can still find what you're looking for; might just take you a minute more.  Will definitely come back again.<//Review>

<review>All The Reviews Are True I've Been Going Here Since I Was Little & They Have Always Been Pretty Expensive. They Won't Always Have The Newest Cleats But They Do Have Variety In Other Stuff & Lastly The Owner😐So You Guys Know Who She Its An Old Nigerian Lady Who Always Seem To Be Cranky & It's Just Her. I Hope She Decides To Retire B/c She Is The Main Problem & That's Why I Stopped Going Here< /review>< user_name>

If it were possible to give zero stars, I would.  The store is over priced and they’re stealing from people. They purposely ripped off the price tags and when I went to a different location the same item and it was 30 dollars less.  The customer service was also disgusting and they treated people very poorly.< /Text>

< review>
So I was looking for a pair of indoor soccer shoes and I called yesterday at around 7:50PM. I wanted the shoes for a birthday present for today. Whoever answered the phone (male) told me that he had the shoes size 8 in the store. I went in today to buy them. I was the first one in the store. The person working this morning tells me that he did not have the shoes in the store but could be ordered in by tomorrow. I was upset because he was trying to sell me an 8.5 when I said no. That is BS I drove 30 minutes to get the shoes size 8 that were confirmed last night by the employee and it was a freaking lie.  I do not recommend this store to anyone. The shoes are cheaper on Amazon.< /review>

<review>they are top notch with their customer service. they went out of their way to deliver some merchandise from their LA store to Van Nuys so  that i wouldnt have to drive down there to not only make the purchase, but to pick up as well. Will def shop here again!

<Text>as soon as i walked is i was asked if i was looking for anything specific. I was looking for a blue nike ball and right away she knew what i was talking about. Very friendly. There were about 5 other people in there but she was on top of things. as soon as i tried on some shoes she helped someone out and by the time i was taking the shoes off she was there to ask if everything was ok. i ended up going for a ball and came out with a netherlands jersey and some indoor soccer shoes. How can you resist when their so nice. will be shopping here again soon. for all my jerseys.</Text>< Pictures>

I’m a patient at Peninsula Orthodontist Huntington Beach. They are very nice and generous. They have an amazing variety of colors for the bands they put on the brackets and Dr Hou is such a caring doctor and she is very gentle with you teeth.< /review>

Peninsula Orthodontics in Huntington Beach came highly recommended by a friend who had several of her kids get ortho treatment here.  My son is almost done with his treatment and my daughter just started hers a few months ago.  It is a great place and we are very happy with Dr. Hou and staff.  I highly recommend to others for orthodontic treatment.< /Review>

My sister got her treatment here at Peninsula Orthodontics in Huntington Beach and her results were wonderful. Soon after I got my braces on and have been coming here for about a year now and my experience throughout this process has been splendid. Any problems that I’ve had they have been great in assisting me with it. They ensure my visit here is comfortable and enjoyable. My treatment couldn’t have been any better, I love how it is going as my teeth were my biggest insecurities. I am excited to see the results!!</review>

Peninsula orthodontics in Huntington Beach is where I started my braces journey. I'm 19 so I got them a bit late but Dr. Ho explained the process to me thoroughly and make be feel very comfortable. The assistants are so nice too! Dr. Ho is very professional and knows exactly what she's doing which I really appreciate.<//Review>

As an adult in need of orthodontia I booked 8 consultations to find the right fit. I selected Peninsula Dentist HB in Huntington Beach; Dr Hou and the office staff are amazing. When choosing a dentist, never underestimate the importance a friendly staff, especially when embarking on a multi year orthodontics journey. Good scheduling options and they take the extra effort to make sure you are educated on the process.< /Text>

I just got my braces off and this place was helpful throughout my 3 year process. My family and I have been patients here for 13 years and they have become part of our family.  There are kind people everywhere here and they never fail to put a smile on my family and my face.  Rochelle is one of the kindest people I have ever met. She always has cared about me in the office and out of the office. I love this place and recommend it 100%!!!</text>

I have been taking both of my kids to Penninsula Orthodonics in Huntington Beach since Dr. Tipton was the Orthodonist. Now Dr. Hou is there and she’s just as amazing. We’re so lucky to have found them.</text>

I spent $29.00 and they had no restroom i had to go to Marshalls. Edit i drove by this afternoon and i only saw 2 customers eating outside. The bad service your employees him scare off customers. I attract customers and im a customer. Btw ive read reviews and theres complaints about guamole going bad and still being served to customers. not cleaning dining area and not filling an order correctly.</review><GmapID>0x80c2c916eb17603d:0xeec253fddd97dd4c< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>My husband handed the cashier, which was in training, the money for our lunch. The cashier returned the change but not in hand. The bills spilled onto the counter and the trainee made no attempt to pick it up, apologize, say my bad..nothing. The trainer mentioned something to the young man and still no attempt. People should be treated with respect as the paying customer, i will never eat at this place again.  If youre like that as a trainee, what kind of manager will you be? Ill be contacting the corporate office on this one.< /text>< pics>

<review>My co workers and i placed an order today through the mobile app for delivery during our lunch hour.  When I received my ordered. We were missing some items. Contacted the store and Laura told me she packed my order herself and she made sure she sent everything.  Explained to her I am looking at the order and there are items missing.  She rudely told me again she packed everything.  My colleagues and I could not believe she would insist she sent everything when we were clearly looking at the bags in front of us missing things. Terrible customer service!  Will never order again from this location.

The proper thing to do would have been to apologize for the mistake. Not argue with us about items that were NOT in the bag.

Definitely time to retrain your crew on how to properly read, complete and make an order. And recheck it before sending it out.< /review>< GmapID>

<review>I usually go to this place, it is normally really good in the amount they put in your bowls. However this time they gave me almost rotten guacamole. It was really brown and I did not want to have to drive back to the store and get another one when they shouldn't be giving this to customers anyways. I smelled and tasted it and it tasted fine, but some parts tasted sour and I could not finish it. I hope next time they throw out the scraps and don't give it customers. I ordered online, by the way.<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPSLO4C7ZdmaflMvMKWWl_mVgvWCZqIuGYlbmEc=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Text>They never have my food ready when I preorder online. I've shown up at the time it says it will be ready and I've purposely shown up 10 mins after it says it's ready, but it never is. The part that ticks me off the most is that the employees are just standing around hanging out. It wouldn't bother me as much if I had to get back to work so quickly . But yeah I guess the food is good, the location is alright but the service could use a bit of work .</Text>< Rate>

< Review>
I came here to buy a bowl and chips and Queso. I placed my order and as soon as I get to pay I ask for the chips with queso. The girl at the register says she can not sell it to me because it is only for the online orders. Which I respond to her I only came to eat here because I wanted chips with queso. She gave me the most disgusting face and said she couldn’t do anything about it. She would not sell me the chips with queso. If an item is gonna be exclusively for online orders there should be a sign at the door or before you place the order. False advertising when you have a big sign of chips and queso on your menu. Please do better and  teach your employees to be respectful.< /Review>

<Text>I ordered through doordash and i ordered one simple item, a veggie bowl. What's so hard about that? I received my order and while eating i realized im chewing chicken. Now im a vegetarian and the fact that i unknowingly maybe ate some of it until i figured out what it was is so disappointing. Sad i can't trust restaurants these days. They have immature people working at this place and can't get one simple order right. If i were allergic I'd definitely sue.</Text>< pictures>

I luv Chipotle, i wish i could buy stock. I think their food is the bomb. So many combinations and their portions are generous. This location does not serve beer, but non the less it's my favorite spot to stop and eat.< /Review>

<review>The location of this Chipotle was pretty awesome! There was Mexican band baling outside in the little shopping square they had there and people were just singing and dancing 😁.... Pretty sure that doesn't happen there everyday but it was a great Chipotle experience because of that.<//review>< pictures>

I don't know this always happens to me. I get the chicken, and about a quarter way through, I notice a piece of really pink undone chicken piece. I could've complained but decided not to. I just toss the rest of the food and hope I don't get sick. It is amazing how this place is still open...</Review>

Look at the size of this burrito it did not even fill in the tray. I've been to multiple chipotles and they are all great but my local chipotle always disapoints.  I love the food but the staff always makes the smallest burritos it's not even funny.look at the picture I uploaded the burrito looks like the took a quarter of it out. And to top it off it was more rice and beans than anything.< /Text>

<Review>Well let me say the food is great but it sucks that they dont stock up on the ingredients i mean thats false advertising either they dont have one item or the other. If everytime i come after gym i cant have what i see in the menu. I come in this place every other evening and i feel like im in a hurry. By 8pm i cant sit outside cuz they are bringing in the patio stuff... i mean if they close early they should change the closing hours to 830pm or 9pm... just saying! What a disappointment.<//Review>< Rate>

<Text>Food was so cold, not to mention that the chips were so stale I had to ask for a new bag. The new bag had crunchy chips on the top and as we finished the bag noticed that the chips on the bottom were stale. Very dissapointed. Last time im going to this chipotle.< /Text></record>

<Review>When i usually come here, i am greeted by employees I recognize and they are all pretty friendly.

But when I came into the store this evening (7/3/17) at around 9pm, I didnt see the usual employees and i stepped up to the counter to order. I was greeted by a young man on tortilla and he was taking my order. I order a chicken burrito and when we got up to salsa station, i saw that the pan for corn was empty. I politely asked if there was any corn, the employee looked at me and said "No, there isnt". He said it very serious. I just shrugged it off and i asked if i could have a little guac and he said that i would still be charged and i it was totally fine. He served the guac on my burrito and it was just a dab. It wasnt a full serving so i just asked if i can just have the full serving instead. The employee sighed at me in annoyance and "so you DO want the full serving?" and i said yes and apologized and he just replied with "okay?" with a weird smirk on his face.

It just made me a little upset, i was not mean at all to him and he was being very rude to me. Im not sure if he was new or not.< /Review>< Response>

<Review>I used to work for the Koehls in 1987  when they were just getting started. I knew them to be the kindest most compassionate loving family and friend to their employees. Hard working and completely dedicated to their craft. I  remember them making me feel part of the family  and special
From surprise birthday party, lunches at great restaurants. Time off whenever needed. My child had the chickenpox and they gave me a week off so I could be with him. The father was hilarious. As was the whole family. The mother  was the sweetest lady I've ever met. They raised great kids. The best! Corny the daughter was so gifted and funny and really cared about me as a person and not just an employee. I miss them all. They would give you the shirt off their back kind of people
. I would buy and trust their products in a second. Their love and dedication for their products brought them to where they are now in 2020. Simply awesome in my opinion. Don't base judgement on a few minutes with a billionaire. It's not like they turned down  some poor guy trying to make a buck.< /Review>< Pics>

Although I have never been here in person, I love this company. Here is a Shoutout to Skullduggery:

A few months ago back in June 2020, I bought an An African Elephant motorized 3D puzzle and put it together. However one of the puzzle pieces broke. So I e-mailed the manufacturer and asked for a replacement piece of the one that broke. Not only did Peter Koehl respond to the e-mail and say he would send me another replacement piece, but the company also blessed me with another African Elephant 3D motorized puzzle and surprised me with a B-29 Bomber 3d motorized puzzle. It got shipped to my house and I did not have to pay for anything, not even shipping.

This company goes above and beyond serving its customers. Their customer service exceeds beyond what most companies do today.
I am very thankful and happy that this company cares for its customers and was able to fufill my request.
Skullduggery transforms something that is disapointing to something even better than before.</text>

I bought a Glow Streaker Blazing Loop Race Car Set for my Grandson for Christmas, through SkullDuggery. I called the company to see if I could buy a replacement track, as one of the tracks got  broken. I spoke to Peter, who was very professional, and personable. He agreed to mail me the replacement part at no charge, nor did he charge me for shipping. At that moment SkullDuggery renewed my belief in the old adage  of "The customer always comes first."  As we all know, this of type service is unheard of in today's age! I am extremely PLEASED WITH SKULLDUGGERY AND THEIR SERVICE, and would definitely recommend them to all my Family and Friends!!!< /text>

What innovative product developed by a small family company with vision.  The quality of their new casting plaster is wonderful, no bubbles.  Just use what you need for a project and the heavy duty zipper bag will keep it dry until the next time you need it.  Skullduggery is always coming up with new product, new designs, new packaging for toys, and crafts

Completely managed from the top down. Contacted these guys about a private label toy and was treated like a was trying to exstract trade secrets. Was told I would be called back several times and never was. I later found out they were on TV and thought they were big industry players. I guess my little 100k plus  a month PO was nothing to them. Best of luck !!</review>

<user>104365344475396132699<//user><Review>After almost 5 hours of waiting, they said they could not tow my F-250 because it was too heavy and they needed a bigger tow truck (they arrived with a flatbed).  They wanted to charge me direct ($300) instead of using my insurance.  Their first eta given was 60 minutes, 4.5 hours later they showed up and couldn’t do it.  I called S&R towing, they came out in 40 minutes and hooked up the truck with a similar duty flatbed no sweat.

Never dealt with a tow company as bad as roadway and I’ve dealt with a lot.<//Review>< name>

<Text>If I can give -5 stars, I would give without a doubt. So, whatever negative review people gave in comments below are all true. If your insurance company pick this company, just ask them to find another service provider. Initially they told me it will take only 45 minutes, then they kept on adding 1 hour every time I called. It's been 4 .5 hours and I am still waiting for my car to be towed. Service staff is rude and keep on lying about estimate wait time.
Google reviews for this company are either 5 star or 1 star, looks like most of 5 stars came from employees of this company just to improve the rating.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Haitham was super professional and very knowledgeable! Not only was he prompt and communicative but he fixed my sons car saving us time and money dealing with a shop we would have had it towed to. Very impressed! Will definitely recommend!</text>

<text>Hi! DO NOT GO HERE! I am not one to usually give reviews ever, but this place is pretty terrible! I’m a 18 year old girl, they changed my car battery and gave me the wrong battery! And I was left stranded on the side of the road for an hour in a sketchy area! When I called to let them know I had the incorrect battery they basically said they couldn’t help me and the owner is never in.<//text>< pictures>

<review>Big help from Jovan and amazing customer service from her. Got me what need right away with no hesitation. Superior Service thats fast and reliable, went above and beyond the line of duty to Aide and assist during time of distress. By far the ultimate savior when it comes to roadside assistance professionals. Highly recommended from my family to yours.< /review>< Gmap_id>

Do not trust them! I needed help jump starting my car and the representative who was dispatched led me to believe that the ONLY option was to replace the battery because if we tried to jump start the car, we could damage the alternator. Based on the research I did afterwards, this is not true at all. I considered changing the battery myself but he made it sound very difficult when apparently, it is really not that hard. He was very unprofessional and I felt scammed.</Review>

<Text>They would not jumpstart my car and instead pressured me into buying a battery that only lasted 2 weeks, only to die shortly after and claimed it needed a new one. The second time around they also refused to even try to jump the car, and instead insisted I need to buy a new one and “only” pay $60 for labor since the last was on warranty. I was very frustrated with the service and felt I overpaid just to get my car running again. Stay far away from this company, it is a scam.</Text><Response>None<//Response><Rating>1<//Rating>< user_name>

The consensus on here is correct.

If you get dispatched through your roadside assitance or insurance carrier, you’re better off requesting another company.</review>< pictures>

<Text>My insurance company used Agero and they referred me to this company. Roadway towing was very unprofessional.  I waited at least 6 hours to get my car towed 18 miles.  Every time I called to get an update, they would say someone would be there in 35, 45, or 1 hour.  The employees didn't have any idea when someone would be available.  In the meantime, I was stuck at the same location waiting.  On top of that, they delivered my car to the wrong location.  I called back to let them know they made a mistake. Next, I asked them to transport my car to the right location which was about 10 miles away, they said I would have to go through my insurance again. In other words, they wanted me to pay again for their services although they towed my car to the wrong location.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.  They have a lack of customer service skills and they do not value customer satisfaction. They need to either close permanently or hire competent employees. My rating is a 0.</Text>< GmapID>

<Text>I had a vehicle towed here by CHP after an accident. Getting in to get personal items out of the vehicle was a little bit of a pain. Bring your license and a copy of insurance or registration and you’ll be good.
Also watch out for the tweakers, they can be quite a show. When I was there one of the tweakers was threatening the employees and spitting at them. I was nearly hit by a fat phlegm filled lugie.  I was impressed with how management handled them. Wish I had it on video.

Fun place to people watch.< /Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80dbf55f4f0bcc6d:0x9026f16a9090cfe6<//GmapID></record>

< Review>
Worst service in North County. This company was assigned for a tow service through my insurance but never showed. They are extremely disrespectful and rude, I spoke to multiple representatives at the location and still no resolution. To top it off a gentleman in the background can be heard screaming to the rep to place me on hold, the gentleman then gets on the phone using foul language and yelling “what is your *** problem, I just heard her repeat herself 5 times”.  Regardless of the day Monday is not an excuse to be rude or aggressive with any customer, if you don’t like your job GET AN EDUCATION and find a career. To sum it up STAY AWAY AT all cost. #ETA45 4 hours later.<//Review>

Despite my insurance company hiring them to take my car to a collision center, they took my car to their own facility and refused to release it unless I paid for them to tow it to the facility my insurance had originally requested. My insurance is currently having to fight with them to get my car back. THIS PLACE IS A SCAM.<//text>

Absolutely, without a doubt the worst towing company in the world.  Incompetent.  Indifferent.  I'm almost 70 and I have never ... ever ... seen this horrible of a company.  Clueless and confused would be a compliment.  Try anyone but them.  I won't get into the details but it took 2 days and then I called a private company.<//Text>

<text>After a 2.5 hour wait I called another company. I had a baby in my car waiting in the heat.
I started at noon with the initial call.  I then called at 1:00pm and spoke to a woman (White girl) who was EXTREMELY RUDE.  She said someone would be there at 1:30.  Called back again at 2:10, (spoke to a Hispanic lady) who then said sorry but can’t help you now, “we’re too busy”! She told me to “LEAVE MY KEYS UNDER THE MAT WITH THE CAR UNLOCKED”, and they would get my vehicle when they “had time”.  I couldn’t believe what I was hearing!   I Waited until 2:30, and then finally called another company.
This company should be out of business!!!!< /text><user>100198379520613898710< /user>< rate>

<review>Well I was supposed to use this service for a flat tire change, but after waiting for almost an hour and a half for them to come at the time they told me AND even another 15min past when they originally said. They all the sudden added an extra 50 min. When I called to ask why and that I felt unsafe with the fact I was stuck on the side of a poorly lit road with my 2 young children. And that this road constantly had homeless people live and walk on it, she replied very rudely that she didn’t have people to send out. And when I told her that I don’t understand why someone wasn’t coming though in the almost 1.5hrs that they said they would come? She said again RUDELY if I don’t have people I don’t have people. I personally wonder if because I was disappointed that they added the 15min in the first place, because it was getting dark, that she moved me down the line. I called my insurance company and told them I never want to work with this company again because of how they treated me. I ended up driving home at 8:10pm with my flat tire, initiated services at 6:15..</review>< Pictures>

<review>My vehicle was towed by this company at an apartment complex. They damaged my vehicle in multiple spots and I didnt not notice the damage until I got home. Called them multiple times afterwards and sent multiple emails and they finally responded saying they would not assume responsibility because I did not catch the damage at the tow yard. On top of that they charged $421 dollars for a tow and keeping my car for 1 night. This company is unprofessional and their drivers do not know what they are doing.</review><user_name>Chase Maurits</user_name><Date>1599065122394< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating>< resp>

If I could give zero stars I would give even less. Needed a tow truck and made that incredibly clear over the phone so they sent us a service truck to jump start an electric car! "We'll be there in 45 minutes" they told us FOUR TIMES. Just awful. Sat on the side of the road for 4 hours  Had to leave car on side of a major freeway overnight and cancel the tow. No trace of sympathy or sense of urgency or professionalism from these guys. They aren't even deserving of the 2.6 stars they have overall.<//text>

< Review>
On 4/20/20 I scheduled with my insurance to have my vehicle towed to my local dealership the very next day at 7:00 am.

The towing company called me the night of 4/20/20 and I confirmed my appointment. The very next morning I received a phone call at 6:30 am stating that the tow truck was outside, which was 30 minutes early but no worries. I informed the driver Jerrell what entrance to wait for me as I was getting dressed because I had just woken up.

In the midst of getting ready to head down to the entrance, the driver called me three times and then had the dispatcher call me again asking me why was I not answering and he was waiting downstairs, all within the span of 5 minutes. I explained again that I was getting ready and I was on my way to meet him. I called the driver to clarify and as he answered the call, he sighed and huffed at my statement that I was heading towards him.  As I opened the gate for him to come in and get my vehicle he had a rude demeanor. I told him I’d meet him at the drop off site.

Upon arriving to my tow location Jerrell released my vehicle from the bed of the tow truck and threw my keys at me from a distance of 15 feet and departed.

I understand that everyone has bad days but I felt his attitude was unjustified and disrespectful and throwing my keys was extremely unprofessional. Obviously, by my treatment my patronage is unwanted and I will highly recommend people look for other towing options.< /Review>

<text>Had a fantastic experience with Jerrell today. My car wouldn't start and he was able to load my car on his truck quickly and help me drop it off at the Chevy dealership. He was extremely professional and friendly. His truck was clean and he was an expert driver. If my car ever fails to start again I hope Roadway Towing picks tows my car.<//text>< Pictures>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>I haven’t and won’t ever use their services. I ride a motorcycle and was on my way home tonight, and one of their truck drivers was severely riding my tail. If I had to estimate the driver was about 15 feet behind me and we’re going 55 mph, and I was traveling the same speed as the cars in front of me. At the first chance I got, I allowed the driver to pass me, but good god! Drivers like that are how motorcyclists wind up dead!

For reference, it was about 6:30 pm going northwest on Del Dios near Lake Hodges.< /review><time>1579835473691</time><response>None</response><pictures>None</pictures><user>106871055169540462753< /user>< Name>

So I did have to tell them how to take off the air filter which covers the battery in my car so one star off. And the owners manuel for the car says to connect the negative to metal and not to the battery but he connected the leads to the battery itself. It was in warranty so I paid nothing. But he was very nice and got the job done for me so I have nothing to complain about how he started the car even though I had to show him how to do something. So if you need a jump with this company look at the owners manuel if the battery is covered. He almost broke the connector<//Text>

<Review>If you're not using triple A or something of the sort don't do it. I requested a tow from Escondido to Oceanside, and they didn't tell me that their procedures had change and that the person can't ride with the tow driver. When the driver got to my location he informed me that I couldn't ride with him to my destination. I told him that I shouldn't be charged a cancellation fee because I wasn't informed of the change. The company called I told them that I shouldn't be charged because I was not aware of the change they said "I didn't ask", was I supposed to? They tried to use covid-19 as a smoke screen and as a catalyst to give me the run-around and shield their unsavory business practices. Don't do it.< /Review>< name>

I have no idea why anyone would rate this company with 5 stars. I only gave 2 because originally it was not their fault my car was towed, but their handling of the situation was abysmal on their end. The lady who answered the phone couldn't answer simple questions then proceeded to be rude and hang up on me. I wish that your car never gets towed and even more that it's not by this company.</Text>

This company was contracted by my insurance company to come and get my stranded car. Was told one hour to 1.5 hours till I would be picked up. 4 hours later and I've got another company's driver out of the shower to come and get me. Don't use this company they have no intention of giving you an honest estimate of when they will be there. Well in this can IF they will ever show up.< /Text>

My brothers car broke down and their ETA pick up time has been pushed back twice. When I called she said ten minutes and hung up the phone on me. I called back and said someone hung up on me she got all bratty and bitter and said I hung up on her. Very poor customer service. Shouldn't get attitude when I did nothing wrong

So an update, my insurance company called them not sure who they were calling but it was them. Guy that picked up my car had a really, really sour attitude and literally gave me attitude for no reason. This place needs to be overhauled. Not to mention it got pushed back twice waiting for them< /text>

Tow truck driver should be there in 45mins. Called after 45minutes. We are experiencing high call volume, it'll be 45minutes. Called again after 45 minutes, driver is going to be 45minutes. You can just leave your keys in the car if you can't wait. We will call you if anything changes. Never got a call and never got car picked up. Cancelled pick up and asked Honda Care to set me up with a professional tow service. These guys should not be in business.<//Review>

I got into an accident today and Roadway Towing came out to pick up my car. Osamah came out super quick and picked up my vehicle. I got a ride home and they stored my vehicle at their yard until my insurance came out to look at my vehicle. They were all so nice and helpful during this process. I didn't even know what to do but they were so nice and helped me out.<//Text>

<text>My insurance company sent them to change a flat tire and the guy who showed whined and said he couldn't do it!!!!!! I couldn't believe it he said we needed to tow our car to a tire place to do it. We called the insurance company again and they sent a different company who changed the flat right away without whining or complaining about it.<//text><Time>1560389932968</Time>< GmapID>

<Text>Worst customer service ever. I asked to speak with the supervisor and he was not there. There was no manager on duty to solve my problem. The supervisor's name is Jovan, it's funny because he put a 5 star review...</Text>< Pictures>

<time>1564328166640< /time><rating>1<//rating><Text>I called roadside assistance and they sent these guys to give me a tow, they were supposed to pick my car up at 4:45 and take it to a mechanic. At 5:00 I called to make sure everything went well and turns out they weren’t even on the way and told me they wouldn’t be there til 5:40. Firestone closed at 6 and I needed to get my car fixed by the next morning. 5:40 rolls around and I call them to make sure everything went well, they told me it would be ANOTHER 40 minutes. At that point I just told them to leave my car there for the night and do it first thing the next morning. They told me they’d pick up my car right at 8:00 and I’d be the first customer they towed. At 8:20 the next morning my insurance company calls me to tell me that these guys were running late and weren’t going to be there for, you guessed it, 40 minutes! The insurance girl offered to switch me tow service to a different one and I obviously said yes. Not even 10 minutes after she called me the new tow driver gave me a call to tell me he was on the way and everything was going smoothly. I understand that things happen and delays are inevitable, but to make the same mistake 3 times in a row is crazy, if you’re gonna be two hours late let me know so I can switch to a different company!</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<text>The dispatch people are awesome!! I was so nervous about waiting 30 minutes to get my tire changed and Mayra made sure I got prompt attention and made the whole bad experience such a relief!!! I hope that everytime I get a flat, I have Roadway Towing coming out to help! I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!!< /text>< user_name>

They were very rude and disrespectful! I am soo appalled at the way they speak to you. The crazy part is I was kind and respectful through the disrespectful way they talked and conducted themselves to me and they still  continued on being very rude and unhelpful.
I suggest to everyone not to do business with them in any way until they learn how to properly treat people.</Text>

DO NOT BUY THEIR BATTERY OR DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. RAFID WILL SWINDLE YOU. If you need a jump start, go with your gut. Your battery is fine and just needs a jump start. DONT LET THEM PERSUADE YOU TO BUY A BATTERY.<//Text>

<Review>I can’t believe how long they had me sitting on the 15 I called at 11am  and they said 45 minutes to an hour and didn’t show up until 4:45 There service is absolutely horrible and the truck driver smelt like alcohol and cigarettes. Don’t recommend this company to any one!< /Review>< rate>

My insurance send this company out to me for a tow service yesterday. Driver (Ghassan) came out within 30 min and in less then 10min he had my car hooked up and ready to go..he also made sure I waited in the truck and not on the road while he loaded my car..  when we got to the mechanic shop he made sure I was happy with the service and gave me a business card Incase I had any questions. Thank you for all your help ghassan! And the dispatch for following up after the service had been completed to make sure everything went ok.</Text>

It’s enough to be in a traumatizing car accident, but it’s even worse to purposely mislead your customer on the towing charges and take total advantage of them and their vulnerability. Very unprofessional and very unappreciated.

I walked up to the window only to hear a Man on the phone yelling and swearing at the top of his Lungs, a very unwelcoming first experience. I waited for 15 minutes for someone to come to the window to answer my inquiry regarding my impounded vehicle.

I brought along my personal mechanic to survey my vehicle to properly submit a claim to my insurance as well as my legal team, and was definitely denied access with my mechanic.

I’d much rather leave my busted a vehicle on the middle of the road rather than let it sit in lock up on this pathetic impound lot. I leave these comments and the fees with my insurance and the rental company at this point. You all should be ashamed of yourselves.< /text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<Text>Rahid was the one who helped me and he completely disregarded my questions. My battery had died I left my lights on, Ive done this before and had someone jump start my car and I was back on the road. With Rahid on the other hand he would not hear me out all he said was I needed a new battery. He was so pushy and made me really uncomfortable. Don’t use this towing company.</Text>< pictures>

<Review>Went here after midnight & was surprised by how busy it was at that time of night. I guess a lot of people in California have the 420 munchies! Ordered two asada tacos & a al pastor burrito with cheese & whole beans. I quickly realized that I should have ordered more tacos & nixed the burrito. The burrito is where a star was lost here. Refried beans instead of whole, cheese was only at the end of the burrito & the al pastor was basically non existent. I think I saw three or four pieces of pork. But hey, it's called Tacos Mexico for a reason. Fantastic & regret not ordering more. 5 stars worthy, but burrito was, meh.< /Review>< userid>

I tried some tacos de asada and were amazing! It was perfect with the red salsa they have. But where this place really shines is it’s Horchata and Hibiscus drinks.< /review>

Great food, but there are times when the meat can be too hard to chew on or they get the wrong order/don't give you the condiments one asks for. Still a worthy place to eat at.<//review>

The food isn't bad. Open late if not 24-hours  I believe, its pretty cheap for the food portions too. Customer service could be better.< /text>

<text>Love how I can order I’ve true phone quickly and pick up the food in 5 mins, makes my drive from work to home in the mornings easier since I don’t have to wait for the food to be ready!And it’s always so good! I think the guys on Atlantic ave and bear have seen me and my buddies drunk and craving delicious tacos and burritos so many times haha< /text>< pics>

<text>I live in Pasadena, but i like this tacos Mexico in particular because the food here is freshly made, and the staff is very professional, but super friendly as well! At the moment you can only eat outside... But back when things were good, You'd eat inside, which is very clean. And although a small place, they have 3 flat screen TV's, and they're always showing soccer matches from Europe, Mexico, and USA. Oh let's not forget the old-school jukebox which contains a few recent hits, and many older spanish jams... Banda, Norteño, Mariachi, etc.

I love this tiny taco joint, the food is delicious and reasonably priced! I always go for the tacos... But I've had everything on the menu, and it's all good!

Price is right. Food was good. Service was good. Same flavor from back in the days. I used to come to Bell High over ten years ago. I remember this place, had to stop by and check if they still had the OG flavor! And they still got it!</Review>

<review>The tacos are amazing here, if u dont like spicy food tell them no sauce. But if you are looking for the heat a little bit goes a long way. Tacos are small so get more than 3 or 4 if your hungry.< /review>< Response>

<review>The guy overcharged me.  I was told they had a promo on Tuesdays.  Tacos were half off.  I asked him about it and said that they were $1.50.  The place was not clean and the tacos weren’t that good.  They did have a really nice salsa though.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><username>Waell Yafawi< /username><UserId.>104722493966037601770<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80c2cebeaeee6e15:0x9753ad177530969a< /GmapID><rate>1</rate><date>1520372217194<//date></record></dataset><record>

These tacos are the best. Full of flavor and good sized.  Be careful of the green sauce, its very spicy. It's best to habe the salsa on the side until you know what your palate can tolerate.<//text>

Prices are a bit on the high side. On a good note, they are quick in getting your order out. And the place is always clean.</Review>< Name>

Came here after a late night craving and I was presently surprised on how good it was. Burrito was huge compare to "king Taco"...... I payed about 6.50 for an asada burrito. It was ready very quick , only waited about 2min for my order. 5🌟 👍👌</Text>

< Review>
Bom Tacos here, I wanted to try something different today and I had beef Tacos with a same drink ( coke ).

Never judge how a place looks until you try it.

Food is good and delicious bathroom is disgusting stay out of there. The only problem is after the guy gets your money he has no gloves and he does not wash his hands after that he rolls your burritos and puts your taco in the foil so that's gross<//review>

<Review>This Tacos Mexico in particular is the best one. Been coming here since 1993, and like it as much now as I did the first time I decided to give it a shot. The food is delicious, the staff is very clean, and super friendly. My personal favorite is the BUCHE burrito Ortega the CARNITAS taco. Both with the red sauce. Make sure to request the salsa on the side, since it's a bit spicy. The music that auto plays from the juke box is a bit loud, but goes well with the atmosphere as well as the soccer channel on both TV's. It's a very small restaurant with indoor/outdoor seating. You should definitely stop by to try, I'm sure you'll like it as much as I do. And the prices are on the cheaper side too!< /Review>< pictures>

<review>I've been to many other Tacos Mexico, and I would not recommend at all. This one, located in the tiny city of Bell is fantastic. The customer service is beyond good, these guys are always in the best of moods. Their good spirit reflects on the food... This little taco joint prepares and serves the best tacos, burritos, sopes, tostadas, and tortas infantiles the area. Trust me I know tacos, I grew up on them! And the prices are definitely cheap. For instance 1 burrito 2 tacos + soda will run you around $12, I truly recommend this place. Nothing fancy, just delicious food, great mood, and fantastic prices. Try the buche and or carnitas tacos with the red sauce! Oh, they also offer all you can eat grilled onions.
Thank you</review><pictures>None< /pictures><resp>None<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Probably the worst costumer service I’ve had in a long time. I was the only one in line waiting and the employees all saw me as I waiting for about 10 minutes to even place a order. Plus the food was trash. Wouldn’t recommend at all.< /review>

<text>I really regret going. I got a burrito of asada and 4 tacos de carnitas. I think they got my tacos wrong I got home and they were really oily and the meat was steamed, never had tacos that way, taste like mush... Almost puked. This was at 3am. The horchta was bomb.<//text><Rating>3< /Rating><response>None<//response>< UserId.>

(Translated by Google) No wonder tacos mexico is not the same of years the bathroom is disgusting the tables smelled really bad if a restaurant to me if a restaurant cant provided with a dissent place to wash your hands cant handled food the right way this place needs greater attention.
Tacos Mexico is no longer the same for years, not only the food has changed, the bathroom in this place unfortunately is horrible the smell is disgusting the tables smell very bad for me if even a restaurant does not care where its customers wash their hands Where they sit is not good. You lose your appetite after washing your hands. I smell a bathroom. So sitting at tables that smell bad is even worse.

<Text>(Translated by Google) Unquestionably an authentic flavor of the Federal District, the capital of Mexico, where the best dishes are prepared here in Tacos Clarita, it is possible to remember and keep alive that incredible flavor that makes us go back in time when our grandmothers cooked and that is what you can find here a little corner of our beautiful Mexico I highly recommend it.
