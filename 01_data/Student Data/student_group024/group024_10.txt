Really clean haircut! Exactly what I asked for, but better. Thank you!

I appreciate that he took the extra time to tighten it up even more at the end as well. Will definitely plan to return next time I'm in the area.<//Text>

This place is great. I get a razor fade and shave my face as well as trim my mustache when i go. They have never messed up and have always been professional. I also have been taking my son here for a few years now too. Although not specializing in kids cuts, they're always great with kids and do an amazing job. I highly recommended to anyone looking for a great cut. It's not the cheapest place in town, but they get the job done.<//text>

Great spot and cuts. Note prices have jumped from $25 two years ago to $40 today (pre-tip), on the steep side for my 9 and 11 year olds.</Text>

Took my nephew to get his hair cut. Cool vibe, clean, professional barbers. $35 for a cut, which is inexpensive considering it feels upscale while at the same time a great and relaxed atmosphere. I will bring him back.<//Review>

< review>
I called ahead to try making an appointment for both my, and their, convenience.

The guy that answered the phone sounded like he couldn't hang up fast enough. He was super monotone, just said "okay" a lot, and never asked for my name.

When I arrived there were three guys inside that worked there, and no customers. I was greeted nicely, and we got to it.

I went in to clean up my beard lines and make them more symmetrical. He did an alright job over all, but didn't really ask any questions about what I was going for specifically, which was kinda weird. On the other hand, I didn't offer up any commentary, so I don't fault him on it. When he shaved around the beard lines he didn't do a great job. I know because he came back in with a safety razor afterwards, which was weird. It was a cold shave with shaving cream applied with his fingers, so that might have played a role.  He cut my neck in a bunch of spots, but that does happen I suppose. I also noticed a lot of hair and a significant amount of shaving cream on my neck after I got to the car. While checking I was mostly concerned with the line shape and didn't notice. Not a huge deal, but little things add up to make an experience good or bad in my opinion.

I have a short list of places I usually go for a shave, but today I was in a hurry so I googled around for a decent place nearby. I'd say it's fine if you're crunched for time. If you can wait I'd suggest finding a place that specializes in a good shave.</review>

Took my 12 year old son to get his haircut a couple months ago, and am going back before the school year starts. I uses to take him to my salon, but I'm so glad I found this place randomly on yelp! A barbershop is where the boys and men get great haircuts! It's quick, easy for walk-ins and even open on Sundays. I would definitely recommend this shop. He had Albert the first time and he did an awesome job. My son has thick hair and Albert used the clippers and thinned it out so even 3 months later the haircut looks good!< /review>

Have gone here fairly often for a while, won’t go back. Asked for a low fade, got a high and tight, as to fade the side of my beard into the sideburns, got almost the whole thing buzzed off. The guy acted super annoyed when I asked to see what he was doing, then acted even more annoyed when I told him I didn’t want him to keep cutting and still charged me for the haircut and trim.< /review>

Came for a wedding in Cali.  And needed a barber bad and they did a great job.  My barber I forgot his name but was in his 30s and did an excellent job.  Got a lot of complements.<//review>

<review>If you'd like someone to listen to your instructions about how you want your hair cut, visit a deaf man and stay clear of Prestige. If you'd like someone to cut your hair so you leave feeling great about yourself, find a blind man and stay clear of Prestige. Sadly, I can only provide this advice to future curious people after my mistake to drop in. If you DO want to visit, be prepared to have your choice of haircuts: short, shorter, bald. That's about as skilled as these guys get and that's being generous.<//review><date>1519957794379<//date>< GmapID>

<Rate>5</Rate><review>So happy I found this place. I was in dire need of a haircut and chose this place after noticing it was open until 8 PM. I got there about 630 PM after parking my car at Wells Fargo next door. I think you are unofficially allowed to park there after 6 PM and on all day Sundays (at least that's  what the sign says for the Manhattan House restaurant across/next to Wells Fargo. I took a chance and when I got back after my haircut - my car was still there - awesome! Anyhow back to my haircut experience. Walked in, no wait, and was helped by Mike. He asked me how I wanted my hair cut and he went to work. He gave me a nice clean mid fade and a haircut I was definitely happy with for $25.  Highly recommended. I'll def be back.< /review>< Pictures>

Best haircut I've had in the last year. Ask for Mike, he has the front chair by the window. He's the only Barber I've found in 5 years and multiple shops/barbers that has incredible attention to detail and will give you an excellent cut every time.< /Text>

Extremely overpriced. I understand the location drives the price a little but $30 for a 5min, simple trim is overpriced. Also the service is barely average.</text>

<Text>Haircut & shave came out really good! I showed him a picture on my phone of what I was looking for. His shave wasn't what I wanted the first or second time but he worked with me to get exactly what I wanted.

Parked in the back, walked in. I was not greeted. I sat down and as expected you can find a tv and magazines. I got in after 9 am, didn't wait long before taking a seat. I spoke to my barber he did not introduce himself. I sat down showed him what I wanted. Ultimately I go what I wanted while watching with a college game, paid and left.

I would recommend this shop and barber for those looking for a quiet place to get a good haircut. But I may not come back, I just didn't feel welcome.<//Text>< pics>

<Review>The staff all sat in their seats as I arrived and acted like I wasn't there waiting for a haircut. Then they preceded to look at each other before "handing me off" to the only woman in the salon who could NOT give a proper hairline for the outrageous pricing.

As an African American I suggest all men of color STAY AWAY they cant cut our kind of hair.

Very disappointing experience<//Review><time>1460498757929< /time>< userid>

I dig this place. Yeah the decorations might be a little sparse, but they are always fast , friendly and do a great job on my hair.</Text>

Had apps and my mom had drinks. All the apps were incredible! The waitress was an absolute sweetheart. Ambiance was so nice, the live band definitely added to the experience. I would recommend going here to everyone.</Review>

<Review>A friend and I ate here and we were super excited to try it out I ordered the mushrooms as an appetizer and I explained to them in great detail that I was severely allergic to goat cheese and asked if the goat cheese that originally came on the mushrooms could be exchanged for a different type of cheese and they explained to me that it was no problem that they could do feta cheese instead and that they would absolutely make sure that there was no goat cheese on it after that my friend ordered and she asked the waitress if the dishes she ordered was spicy and she insisted it wasn't so then we placed our order. When the mushrooms came I was still really hesitant about the cheese so I had my friend try them before me and sure enough they had goat cheese all over them and when I brought it up to the waitress she apologized and explained to me that another table had ordered the mushrooms as well and they ended up getting the one with feta cheese that they accidentally got switched somehow. Then my friend ended up getting her main dish which was so spicy she couldn't even eat it. Accidentally switching something like that could have ended up terribly for me I could have ended up in the hospital or worse and the waitress was very rude I will never go back there ever again it's not worth it<//Review>< Rate>

The waitress was an airhead forgot our appetizer then I complained about the entree asked to trade it for a burger and she said no. Avoid this place I say.</text>< Pics>

The chorizo stuffed dates wrapped in bacon and covered in crumbled bleu cheese and scallions is a must try. Staff are excellent and the atmosphere is warm and welcoming with live music. Well worth the visit.<//review>< pics>

WoW, had dinner here sat. night. And it was the best meal I have ever had.
Crispy Brussel Sprouts are to die for.
Price is really reasonable, you are missing out if you don't try it.<//text>

My favorites are the "Bali Hai" flatbread, the "Chorizo Mussels" in a garlic white wine reduction, the "Cheese Cake Parfait" as well as the "Pita and Hummus"... It certainly helps that everything is cooked and baked in house and that new special entrees and desserts are thought up each week!</review>

Waitress addressed my boyfriend thinking he was gong to pay for the bill, surprise, I did. Waitresses, don't assume men are going to pay for the bill,  knowledge both parties. I tried to have eye contact with our waitresses and for some reason my questions weren't that important.  I was tempted to say " hey, address my qurstions, I'm paying for the bill"  food was ok.< /review>

This laundromat is amazing! When i am doing my laundry, employees clean up with disinfectant spray the store all the time. And they provide LYSOL spray and handsoap for customer.  I feel so comfortable with their cleanliness. They really seemed to care about customer's health and safety.</Review>

First and last time I come to this laundry... the washer machines are way too much trouble to put the coins in, people need to hit it hard with your hand to make the coin going in.</Review>

I needed 3 copies of my key, and I didn't want to drive to a Home Depot to get it done. I found this place on google, arrive there and the person that took care of me was super nice, fast and gave me a great service. The prices are good and they do have free parking on the back. I would recommend for anybody in the area.</review>

<review>I needed the lock on my front door changed to prevent anyone who once had a key to this place the ability to get in.  When I called and explained my lock to the owner, he said that he gives free estimates and they could come out and take a look.  Literally within 20 minutes Ami came, took a look and told me that it would be much more cost effective if he just changed the cylinder combination and made me new keys, instead of buying a whole new double lock system.  So I took his advice and within 15 minutes had the new cylinder done and handed me 3 new keys.  Ami was so helpful and kind, and on top of that respectful of covid-19.  He was masked and gloved and had hand sanitizer, which he repeatedly used.  I really appreciated that.  If you need a locksmith, I highly recommend Ami.  He was fast and did a great job.< /review>< username>

<review>Excellent service, and so fast and cheap. I had a broken car key for a car that's over 20 years old and everywhere else I tried they would have had to ship in a replacement. Even the dealer would've had to special order it. Here it took 5 minutes. I was able to get my car off the street in time to avoid a fine!<//review>< pics>

I had lost my car key and called for their services, a gentlemen arrived like in 15 min. Made me a key and I was on my way. Then months after I found my lost key and I called them back to program it. Ami was so helpful and got my original key to work again . I’m so happy with their service. Ami was very honest and I appreciate it so much.  I definitely recommend them to anyone looking for locksmith services !!< /Text>

<review>What a service! We drive in Belgium with an US imported car, and making a key duplicate in Belgium is just impossible.. We contacted this Locksmith and they told us that we could pass by, the would pull the job without a problem. So we did, and indeed, the job was done very good, fast and at a reasonable price! When back home we tested the keys, and they worked perfectly! Highly recommend this shop!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1547318050432, 'text': 'Thanks  Bart'}</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2970f63150dfb:0x2fdd10b5b0910163</gmapID></record>

<review>Ami was a very nice guy something that should have taking a few minutes took well over a hour while i thinking he was going to charge me more for his time he did NOT.
I needed two keys programmed for my car along with the remotes. He saved me from going to the stealership and spending well over 500.00 i called another locksmith and he wanted 185.00.
So thank you very much Ami

I called a few other places and they quoted me $85 or $95.  I had a show to go to, so asked if they could meet me back at my place at 11:30.  They texted me at 11:15 for my address and were there right at 11:30.  And had the door unlocked within a minute.  Quick, easy and professional.</Text>< Pictures>

<date>1497919322209<//date><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>This morning I had s disaster when I locked my keys in the car with the engine running. (Yes, you read that correctly. I don't even know how I've survived this long) I googled a locksmith in my area and chose to go with CK lock due to the good reviews. I could not ask for a better service. I dealt with two gentlemen, one on the phone the other in person. The locksmith, Benji was awesome. He provided quick service and actually ended up going above and beyond in helping me with my situation. Benji really went out of his way to help me out (literally, went out of his way) I couldn't thank them enough. I'd recommend these guys to anyone in need of a good Locksmith.

Thanks again fellas.<//Text>< pictures>

GREAT! Saved me! Amazing customer service, great personality, and showed up super quick! GREAT prices too! Isaac and his business partner went above & beyond and made sure to help me charge my phone & let me sit in air conditioning while they worked on my car.
After calling other places, I am so happy I went with CK Lock. I recommend everyone whos in need of a locksmith use them!

***Update. All above was great, with the exception of my key not properly working when I left. I was stranded a few times just sitting waiting for my key to work. This happened on a few different days. I did call them, and they were open to fixing it and they did fix it, but it was still disappointing to experience so much inconvenience.***< /text>

Fantastic service!! I needed an additional key and FOB my my Jeep. The dealer quoted well over $200 for the fob, programming and ignition key. I got a fob on amazon for $7 and CK programed it and made a key for $40 total in about 15 minutes. Massive savings plus extremely friendly nice local shop and service. Five stars hands down.< /text>

<Text>The service I received was high quality, fast and simple. Chris came at the exact time i was told he would arrive and proceeded to do the job. In no time I was able to get back into my car and get home. I was very stressed about the situation when I found out I was locked out of my car, but after calling CK Locksmith, they reassured me it would be a simple fix and not overpriced. The price I paid was very reasonable for how fast the job was done. Thank you guys!< /Text>< pics>

Couldn't be happier with my new set of keys. The service was quick and the prices are inexpensive. Plus there's a whole wall of patterns to choose from if you need to tell your keys apart or want to personalize. Highly recommend!< /Text>

Would highly recommend.  I've made an appt. to have my locks replaced and re-keyed.  I called in the morning and they were able to meet me at my house before noon same day!.  They were professional and extremely helpful.  If I ever need locksmith service in the future I will definitely call CL Lock again - reliable and quick service.</review>

I locked myself out from apartment today. CK Lock was the first place I called. He gave me a good price over the phone and less then 10 minutes he was here. Thank God for businesses that offer good service at a good price. Thanks Ami, I was tired so I appreciated your service.</text>

Issac is the best!  I made a bonehead move and lock my keys in my car.  they respond and had my car open within 15 minutes.  I've heard horrible stories about people waiting hours to get out of situations like this and I felt very lucky that I called the right number. Would write six stars if I could. Thanks again, Issac.< /text>

They may be excellent when they are open but they close the shop on Victory at 4 pm. Perhaps their emergency lock service is 24 hour but, despite what their website and Google listing says, their shop isn't 24 hours.</review>

I was looking around for a reasonable and trust worthy locksmith to re key my store here in Sherman Oaks.  I called 3 different locksmiths only to get the run around from most of the locksmiths except Los Angeles Locksmith- CK Lock.   They provided me over the phone information and were able to service my store within hours and at a far more reasonable rate than the others.  I appreciate the great service.< /review>

This is the 2nd time I've used CK and they've impressed me both times. They respond immediately, the work is done professionally, quickly and the price is right. Changing the locks on my business has never been easier. I highly recommend this company for any locksmithing needs.< /Review>

Jonathan is great, very patient and answered my questions promptly and thoroughly. He is always available through phone or email which is wonderful and puts me at ease. I was a long term AAA member and cancelled due to their lack of response and uncompetitive rates, Jonathan’s responsiveness, professionalism and making sure I had the best rate possible made me switch!< /Text>

This is probably the best insurance agency I’ve had. Always work with you. Good rates. Friendly. Where every other agency/insurance falls behind they pick up and go beyond. It really is like they say. “Like a good neighbor State Farm is there”.</review>

<review>My husband and I have been customers for over 25 yrs.  The service we've received has been stellar hands down (plus great rates).  That is why I only recommend State Farm to family and friends.  It's as simple as this. I am still a customer after all these years. "If it isn't broke don't try to fix it".< /review>< Resp>

State Farm's rates are consistently low, and the personal service is really priceless for the peace of mind it gives. In today's world the personal touch means so much!  What was exceptional was State Farm discounted our auto insurance rates by 2/3 during the coronavirus, it's insurance with a heart!<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

I’ve never had an issue with Kevin Lowry. Every time I call I’m asked how my day was and they’re just so kind. Any issue or question I have they’re always quick with finding out info and solving them! Super Satisfied! Even when they’re busy they will make sure they call you back and solve your problems! I personally ask for Jessica Salinas if I ever need anything and she’s a super nice person and very good at what she does! I appreciate her great customer service, and wether its in person or the phone it’s always good!<//text>

The Staff is ABSOLUTELY wonderful. Kind, courteous and understanding. You will never have a better relationship with an insurance company! They never get irritated with questions, or if you call up to adjust your policy every other week (not that I would know of anyone that would do that😉😉). No need to search for another insurance agent again, you’ve found the best!</review>

Jessica was extremely helpful with getting our new car setup with insurance. Also with information on keeping our other car insured while our son contacted his insurance company to insure our older car that we gifted him. Love it when I talk to real  people that understand what we want to do!

< Review>
I met with Kevin Lowry to hear  about different options for life insurance policies. I was pretty skeptical at first because I have had bad experiences with “pushy salesman”. Kevin was not pushy at all. He was very professional, thorough and answered all my questions. I did not feel pressured at all. I did end up making the decision that purchasing life insurance was good for my family. It was a quick and easy process to get insured. Everyone I worked with was very helpful and easy to get a hold. Wether you think you need life insurance or not, I would definitely recommend at the least setting up a meeting with Kevin Lowry to hear your options.<//Review>

<Review>My wife and my experiences with Kevin Lowry and team has been and continuing to be overwhelmingly positive. Our agent, Jonathan, is responsive, clear, and timely with our needs. Kevin and team are always willing to set time aside to answer our follow up questions and assure we leave happy with the answers. Recently when our situation seemed to turn for the worst, Jonathan stuck through it with us and encouraged us to stay positive and hopeful.

I have enjoyed their service for years. I have also shopped around and they have offered me the most coverage for the best price. Their loyalty discounts pay off.

Great company! I highly recommend. When I was searching for Home and Auto insurance Jessica helped me through the entire process and explained everything to me in detail. I even got a discount for having both through them. If you are looking for insurance reach out to them and ask for Jessica!

Thank you State Farm Team!< /Review>

<Text>I have had nothing but positive experiences working with this agency. My representative Jon Huse has been an absolute pleasure to work with, being very responsive every time I have had a question, and always explaining everything in great detail.  With so many options and moving parts, both buying a policy and dealing with a claim can be very overwhelming at times, and I’m glad that Mr. Huse has been there to walk me through every step of the way. You definitely don’t get this kind of touch with other companies. I look forward to working with him for many years to come.<//Text>< Pictures>

Kevin Lowry has been my family's insurance agent for over 5 years. Both he and his office staff have been very responsive to any questions, issues we've had. I recently had an accident with my car and he was instrumental in ensuring that my Porsche was repaired with the proper parts--something that wouldn't have happened without his interceding in the process. We have all of our home and auto insurance with him and will continue for years to come.<//text>

Working with Kevin has been a great experience.  He has been my auto and home insurance agent for about 10 years.  What I like most about Kevin and his team is their friendliness and reliability.  Whenever I need help, they are there for me.  Kevin has always been able to understand my needs, and has been a very trusted advisor.  Keep up the great work!</text>

<review>Kevin has been my insurance agent for 10+ years now, and I worked with him for about 8 years before that!  He is extremely reliable and responsive.  I don't know the staff too well but they have all been very friendly and extremely helpful as I have moved, gotten married, and purchased cars over those 10+ years.  I don't know much about the insurance industry, so it is very comforting to have an agent I know I can trust!< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Linda takes care of all my personal and business insurance needs. I am a Realtor and highly recommend my clients to call Linda when they are looking for an insurance professional. Her knowledge of the many real estate closing issues is exceptional and  she helps make the process seamless.
Linda even helped me get a car loan through State Farm; great rates!

I have been with State Farm insurance for a very long time, We love Kevin Lowry's office for so many reasons.
The staff is so friendly and knowledgeable!
I can get an appointment quickly to discuss whatever questions I might have.
I use this office for my auto insurance, my daughters auto insurance, personal belongings insurance, life insurance, House insurance and investment property insurance.
I also recently refinanced my car through this office and it was quick and easy, I had a check in my hand the same day!
They never fail me.<//Review>

State Farm Insurance has always been there for us on our home and auto insurance and now our RV. The Kevin Lowry office are always friendly and professional, we deal with Sharon Snyder and she knows us by name and she is very helpful with all our needs and fights to get us the lowest and best rates. She explains what everything our coverage includes and makes sure we know exactly what we’re paying for.<//Review>

I started calling around and after my 3rd phone call to different insurance companies, I called Kevin Lowry's office (State Farm) and spoke with Maria. She was able to help me on the spot and was a pleasure to speak with. I am now a member because of the excellent customer service I'd received. She keeps me informed with any changes on my policy so that way I am not surprised which is important to me. Thank you so much!!! :)< /text>< Pics>

<Review>My family has been with State Farm since before Kevin took over the Oakhurst office. I have worked mainly and directly with the staff who all are knowledgeable, efficient and personable. Linda has been my primary contact and puts up with my questions, soothes my fears, and patiently forgives my occasional late installment payments. Who would have thought dealing with yucky insurance stuff could wind up being a pleasure??? Kevin must be doing something right to hold onto such good people!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Rating>5< /Rating><Response>{'time': 1593099346261, 'text': "Thanks Jerry!

I first became a customer of State Farm Auto Insurance way back in 1949 when in high school I purchased my first car.  From 1949 in Santa Monica, CA my agent being Carl Moore, all the way up to Kevin Lowry in Oakhurst, CA in 2013, a total of 66 plus years and at least six or more different agents over the years, I have nothing but praise for their expertise and caring attention to my needs. I included a couple of homes insured also. I'm sure rates could have been possibly less with some of the many companies available, but SERVICE is important and that is what I enjoyed over the years with State Farm. Thank you!!<//Text>

Though the team has moved to Fresno from Oakhurst, I still receive prompt, friendly and sincere service and always feel like State Farm family! Thanks to Kevin, Linda and the team I feel a huge amount of confidence in products and services that always fit my circumstances!< /Text>< pictures>

Kevin Lowry at State Farm has been my Auto and Home Insurance person for over 8 years and I highly recommend him and his agency, for ALL your insurance need's.

His office staff is highly trained and very helpful in handling any problems that may arise for you, from time to time.

If I were shopping for Insurance, Kevin Lowry is the Agent I would go to, with out a doubt.

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>I’m a huge fan of Ricebox! I love the fact that the dishes that they prepare are recipes that were passed down to the owners by their grandparents. Their take on traditional Cantonese dishes are great. My favorite is their crackling pork/porchetta  bowl. The porchetta are nicely seasoned and expertly cooked. It has a nice crispy texture on the outside and a savory and succulent meaty interior. You can upgrade your bowl to include fried rice and a fried eggs. A few other items worth noting are their RBX Cheesy Char Siu Bao, pork fried rice and their salt and pepper chili wings. Their RBX chessy char siu bao is a really unique take on the traditional bao. It’s filling and oh so good.<//Text>< time>

<Text>Buddy loves this place so we decided to check it out on a Friday. They explained the whole menu for me and guided me through the choices. I went for a 2 item box with the chicken and char sui with fried rice. Came out quick, brought us water and kept checking in on us. Refilled water plenty, with really good water too. Food was great, service was great, prices were reasonable, definitely will come back.< /Text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNxTeg3R7968wTRPEpoOznPVph2woxexAwzEB52=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< Response>

<text>Great takeaway gem in DTLA! Highly, highly recommend the porchetta, you get super juicy pork with perfect crispy skin, which contrasts perfectly with the picked cucumber and radish to cut the fattiness and leave the meal not feeling too heavy. Also, the upgrade to char siu fried rice is worth it for that little extra indulgence! Overall, the price is very reasonable for the spectacular food you get.

They have a special Saturday only roast duck but make sure to get it early because they literally always run out! You can also call ahead and reserve and order in the morning.

Finally, I recommend pairing their meal with a classic lemon tea.

Unfortunately, being in DTLA there’s no easily available parking so you may want to park a little further then walk instead of circling the block 5 times like me.< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Somehow their Cha Siu and Siu Yuk have gotten too sweet and salty compared with when they first opened, even though they still use the highest quality cut for Chinese BBQ. Deduct 2 stars.< /Review>< pics>

<rate>2</rate><review>The food was cold and the rice was old. Both had obviously been sitting for ages. Rice was a mushy glob of inedible mush. The flavor of the char siu was great, and I liked the porchetta. The curry was meh. But again, they were all cold! The only thing we had that was actually cooked for us, were the egg rolls (which are delicious).<//review>< Pics>

<Review>Yummy crackling Porchetta and Char Siu rice box. Special family recipe.  The porchetta is crispy with chimichuri sauce that compliment the crispy pork. Must try the steam buns. Great and Fast Service from the owners.< /Review><response>None< /response><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNtjvFF9snGTkKG66TUnB6rfISqI9G2zBYa8vYX=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMloeax2eyv2rUdfdcR2qkU6rd_XKtIySjUntdW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN8W62IAN98crVQO1zDQSdMomOx8e24H4bONCs7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7T-zXv7yidyhgblgltliuNz5RpPEHee5MMvF7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOPcfybjTYJ4HQ3iRRZwCTKrN9X5L2C5EXb-6HH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPl0Z1iHeS4XvBAQtadMnQuY7u_OWV4fLLMRIcF=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOQb8FJv7VQ9HF-8wswiGV9oJ-JBgXuPN_hU3_l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXGQ45EjcVIkeqJHvgTSeZGShEZHdpbH8dIZKT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgV_7l-m-Jwd-ICtNQtYj5_x6G6xvdbJ0NU4Nl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOMdBfA57S0M39x47TPEnS_I4hk_95300SvzUP-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMDvs-FBc_3M9K4YSw_h3M9T1oLWY9r672yTYWY=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOW6U7EJpjRW-4F7AY6WQNMpMfYtZNZnx7JnpNa=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMUN-ABKIQnV5s8Vr5tZ-RFnHQkWcMEGtwnH14J=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNFuwy7YAHCrxbIhciTwJdMUa-aFWQuF8AopZbN=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN1uzyW2q7WWBsvWKg8sE5Sl82FWuOrnNzvxHhC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPFqnnTzrhyqA_2hL8i8FqCdt2HQBy_NHkaVALk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPxUqdpCXzRvtxC7ZqICyGuMOWA31qiAS8TUm9i=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< gmapID>

<Review>I was disappointed , the fried rice was excellent. The duck had A LOT bones in it so it wasn’t comforting to eat and constantly pick bones from your mouth. Then there was the flavor , it wasn’t bad but it wasn’t my favorite. The sauce was missing more of the flavors I care for like garlic and ginger etc. the pickled cucumber were really good and the added egg was nice. What wasn’t ideal was the up-sells - I totally get increasing ticket total for helping the bottom line and happy to pay more for anything that isn’t part of the standard , all im saying is tell the customer eggs are extra , fried rice is extra. I’m not a free loader , just come communication goes a long way for customer service in my opinion. Perhaps
Cantonese food just isn’t for me is always a possibility

My loves ginger chicken had a very rubbery consistency, not a pleasant mouth feel. The flavor was good but I think someone over cooked it< /Review>< response>

<review>Some of the best char siu I've had in the city. Bao were solid, if not a little dry. Got half char siu half porchetta. A little expensive but worth it for the quality.<//review>< name>

<text>Very fresh and delicious food! I highly recommend visiting for an authentic meal in downtown LA. The staff was extremely nice and gave excellent recommendations on the menu.

We also saw a celebrity walk by - Kawhi Leonard of the LA Clippers so that was cool as well!

If you are in downtown LA you must visit!<//text>< Pictures>

< Review>
They’re so awesome! Lovely couple that are nice and proud of their Chinese heritage ! Their food is based on Hong Kong style cuisine like char siu (pork) and rice.

What’s cool is that I noticed their shop because of their logo. It’s an homage to stephen chow from his parody movie of 007 called “From Beijing With Love” an old HK movie in the 90s that’s hilarious.<//Review>

We came here with a a large group of 15 people.  We were seated promptly and the food just kept coming out. The food was pretty good including the barbecue pork (the bomb), the steamed dumplings, the pot stickers and you can't forget the custard  bun.< /Text>

I read about Rice Box in a recent article that discussed Hong Kong style BBQ.  RiceBox is located in the Spring Street Arcade which I've wanted to check out for a while too so we decided to go.  We visited on a Friday night.  RiceBox is pretty small, almost a food court situation, and they were continually busy, even at night when the Spring Street Arcade is fairly dead.  The person who was at the counter was super nice, friendly, and helpful!  The food was great.  BBQ Pork was awesome and the pork and cheese egg rolls were a new flavor experience for me.  Excellent food.  I bought a beer across the way to enjoy with my BBQ too!  Not a fancy place, but delicious food. Highly recommend!!!!<//Text>

This is a review for their soft opening, so the quality of food here can change in the future. Food here are pretty simple, char-siu rice, bao, chicken rice, etc. But what should be simple and tasty dishes are not executed well - everything is over cooked and dry. The char-siu is dry, the porchetta is dry, the rice is hard and dry, even the chimichurri sauce is dry. Couple that with the $12 per dish (on average) price, it's really not worth the hassle. Their bao and fried eggs are good, but that really isn't enough to save them from a 3 star review. Hopefully it'll get better, not recommended right now.<//text>

Having lived in Hong Kong while growing up, I really miss traditional Cantonese cuisine. This spot is traditional Cantonese food elevated. No MSG, Organic, No Antibiotics... and the place is clean and well put-together, with lots of little details of Hong Kong sprinkled throughout the decorations.

The food is phenomenal. Definitely give their Cheese Bao a try. It's traditional steamed Cha Siu Bao mixed with melted cheese all inside a marbled-looking Bao... Difficult to explain but trust me, it's good!< /text>

Portions are small!! Do NOT get mabo tofu if you are getting two or three item combo since they barely give you any. Way too much rice, not enough proteins and unreasonably priced.<//review>

<Text>If you're going low carb or keto just ask for no rice and all vegetables or salad. Porchetta crackling and duck on Saturdays are our personal favorites!

This place is the best. There are some great chooces for everyone. They offer vegitarian options, pork, and chicken.  They offer sodas and water for drinks. A must try is their Boa plate with 1 of each. The buns look beautiful and taste amazing. The dough is not too thick and has a great flavor. The fried pork rice bowl was my favorite with great texture and balanced taste, just make sure you add the fried egg. None of the food items had too much salt.</Text>

Came here for the 1st time with my 2 (Cantonese origin) foodie buddies & a girlfriend. We literally ordered every single box & the very last order or cheesy boa of the night (6:50pm!)
Everything was delicious, the eggplant was a spicy surprise & very flavorful.
The curry beef had a bigger spicy kick, but very tolerable.
I died at the cheesy boa bite!!!
I'm Latina, we got our cheesy beefy tamales, so for me this Boa was heaven! Now, for my Asian homies, it was too weird for them. Its obviously not the norm, & too soon for them to embrace, but we non Chinese girls Loved it!!!
Bring on the Cheesy Boa for days!!!!
The owners/chef were super kind & fun to talk with.
Be patient with the Sundays & Mondays closed...they're being smart & waiting to build momentum towards opening all week. I will trully miss them this Sunday for Ciclavia!< /text>

<Text>Cool stall serving Canto fare with some global influence. The first time I tried it, I got a three combo box with the soy sauce chicken, char siu, and the mapo eggplant. Wasn't that big of a fan because having grown up on eating authentic Cantonese food back in Asia, I thought the chicken and char siu flavors were too muted. Second time, I got the porchetta which they sold out of last time and the beef curry. The porchetta was nice since it was like an Italian take on roast pork with chimichurri sauce, curry was solid. Tried the egg rolls too and I really liked them since they were filled with cheese and char siu bits, also coming with chimichurri. It was like a really cool mashup with empanadas. The staff was very nice and attended to everything I could need without me asking. Overall worth a visit.<//Text><user_id>113660044534951776646</user_id></record>

I love HK BBQ and this place does it well, but I do not think it is worth the price. My bf and I did the build-your-own box with OG Char Siu and Porchetta with a fried egg and ordered the Salt and Pepper wings.

When the food came out the box was about the same size as those square Styrofoam takeout boxes and we got about 7 or 8 tiny wings. The wings were the tastiest thing out of everything that we got. I loved the seasoning on the wings and the birds eye chili provided some good heat to them. I ended up mixing whatever fell off the wings into the rice box because the rice box was bland.

Half of the box was rice and the other half was split between the meat and veggies. The Char Siu was good but not that amazing. It tasted mostly of hoisin sauce. I feel like I could have just bought a whole slab of char siu pork from Sam Woo for about the same taste and cheaper price. The Porchetta was much better than the Char Siu but we did end up with maybe 5 pieces so it wasn't that impressive.

Total we paid for these 2 items with tax and tip was about $30. I was pretty disappointed with this place since the photos of the food here looked so good. I guess photos can be deceiving. I don't think I'd come back any time soon.<//text>

Finally a place for good Cantonese BBQ that's just not in the SGV area! (And not full of MSG) I came upon this place through Eater's recommendation and I was very excited to try since it's hard to come by good Cantonese food in LA.

Parking is a pain but thank God there is a parking lot right next to the Spring Arcade and being downtown, $9 all day parking really isn't that bad since meter parking is pretty much the same during weekdays for 2 hours or so.

I loved the decor of the place, especially their neon red sign that says 'rice' and their logo, which is the famous Stephen Chow's butcher look from 'From Beijing With Love'. Super cool! Seating might be a bit tough since the place is very small but since I know it's suppose to be a to-go joint, it didn't bother me much.

Now, the food!!! I love, love, love, love their Porchetta! Crunchy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside. Yum! Their char-siu was also spot-on, really reminded me of the char-siu that I used to get with my dad in Hong Kong when I was young. Best part is knowing that there are no artificial coloring involved made it that much better! Their vegan shrooming buns are also a must get! I'm not a big fan of mushrooms but that, 'oh my bun', it was delicious!! I can't wait to try  the black soy chicken!! Definitely coming back!< /Text>

<review>Came back the second time since my last visit 3 weeks ago. Ricebox didn’t disappoint me. The quality is still over the top. Char siu and the chicken tasted just as juicy and flavorful as the last time. My children and I took our biggest bites knowing that there was no artificial color, flavor or MSG in them. I just found out that the chicken is organic and they made their own ginger and scallion dippings that go with it and The soy sauce!! So GOOD!!!

Don’t forget to buy extra bao home and heat them up for breakfast the next day. They taste As good as coming fresh out of a dim sum restaurant. My children love them for breakfast.

The only change was ricebox definitely got busier. The line was longer with more patrons waiting for take out than last time but the staff was friendly and helpful.

We were too full to order the porchetta but I’m sure the quality is as good as last time when I visited this little restaurant.

Like I said before in my yelp review. It’s refreshing to find a Cantonese/Chinese take out/cafe that put ethics, quality and its customers first.</review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2c74937227c39:0xa97e2044f8df0738</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<user>114807609662646261225</user><pics>None<//pics><review>A taste of home in DTLA! I grew up on char sui, roasted pork and soy chicken, so to have this authentic Cantonese restaurant open up in DTLA made me really happy! They are located in the Spring Arcade building which adds a nice variety/diversity amongst the other eateries. There are also plenty of parking options close by which is nice. I really like the decor inside RiceBox, with the wall of bamboo steamers and mahjong table top!

The char sui was deliciously tender, savory and sweet just like you would expect in Cantonese bbq. The chicken tasted really fresh with the ginger scallion sauce. And to know their food is organic and has no MSG makes it even better!!

Definitely a place everyone needs to try and Im sure this place will be a staple in DTLA!<//review><date>1539992558262<//date><Response>None</Response><gmapID>0x80c2c74937227c39:0xa97e2044f8df0738</gmapID><name>May-Kay Ng</name></record></dataset><record>

They have educational info for moms and help with important things like formula, milk, bread, eggs, peanutbutter. Not sure why they give out juice for babies though. Overall helpful and nice staff. Also, 2x a year they offer a free dental check for the babies receiving benefits. You can even opt into a flouride treatment if you feel it's appropriate.< /text>< Pics>

Very accommodating. My son can only eat a certain brand of ready to feed formula due to a corn allergy and they managed to get it approved.  Forever grateful.< /review>

Guess men can't get wic for their children when it's needed because it's a women's program.

<Text>I really like this office and the staff and have only had positive experiences here but I dread having to bring my children because the in office toys are always so gross and of course they want to play with them. I understand wear and tear but when the dirty buildup can be seen then it's really time to sanitize the toys.< /Text>< Pics>

It sounds like you had a negative experience at our office, and for that, we sincerely apologize. Because of your feedback, we took the opportunity to reiterate our breastfeeding recommendations at a staff in-service yesterday. We follow the American Academy of Pediatrics Association recommendations on breastfeeding. They recommend that babies be exclusively breastfed for about the first 6 months of life and that babies continue to breastfeed as long as is mutually desired by the mother and baby. Many members of our staff are trained certified lactation counselors and we strive to counsel and educate our community about the benefits of breastfeeding. We love it when moms and babies breastfeed! If you want to discuss your experience further, please contact Julie Casillas, RD, IBCLC at (559) 263-1380.'}<//resp></record></dataset><record>

It's all about customer service! Call to check my online order, rang 10 times.  The girl stated system was down the they won't refund.  Husband went to pick up, came home with someone else order. Tried to call again!!! No answer.  Went back to return and the order we had belonged to the lady who was returning someone else order 😖< /Review>

So we went to the one in Weaverville. The service was slow. They were out of a lot of things. And two out of the four of us got a small case of food poisoning. Skip this location!<//text>

Good work by the young lady that made our sandwiches. That being said, there is a strange taste to the sandwiches, perhaps at all Subways, but this was the first noticeably odd taste. The bathroom was not wrecked, not well maintained, but have seen worse.<//Review>

This Weaverville location was very busy with their lunch rush when we got there. Moved people through very quickly. Made us an awesome sandwich! Great staff and clean shop!< /review>

Well showed up at 7:30pm and the place was closing down they were mopping and the girl informed me the dinning room was closed and would have to take our sandwiches to go, weird they close at 9pm, I felt very rushed and felt like an inconvenience for wanting a sandwich last time I spend my $ here</Review>

As far as Subways go, this one is perty good. Very clean. Good friendly staff. It's a good stop when traveling to the coast. Better than the last food that's close by. And quicker and less expensive than the supermarket. I've never been disappointed with this Subway</Text>

<Date>1626231868777</Date><rate>5< /rate><text>Dr. Omidi. Kudos! Dr. Omidi made precise incisions around my nipples and i hardly have any scarring still to this day! The implants were not over inflated so, I will not need a lift. There is a small amount of loose skin, but during the explantation process they will easily be able to tuck it in. The breast implant lasted about 16 years, with an unfortunate ending as the implant did rupture. Somehow, even as a saline implant it has made me extremely sick and my insurance company is fighting whether it is a medical necessity unfortunately. Danielle and associates have been nice enough to support by still making efforts for old paperwork. I have confidence they can find them to support medical need. I’m really happy that I chose Dr.Omidi to do my surgery. I wish I still lived within driving distance it would be no question where to go to have surgery again. Thanks Dr.Omidi! Oh by the way.. he’s also very handsome 😉 Truly the best surgeon Dr. 90210</text><pics>None</pics>< response>

Dr Omidi went above and beyond my expectations. I’m 4 days post op and I’m so thrilled with my results already. I had consultations with 4 other top Beverly Hills surgeons and no one made me feel as comfortable and as ease as Dr. omidi did. He is truly talented. I am so glad I chose him.<//Review>

<text>I came for a consultation to see Doctor Omidi for a rhinoplasty and from the moment I came in his staff was so welcoming, they showed me his work and boosted about how humble of a doctor he is. When the doctor came for my consultation he was very attentive, and indeed so humble! He showed me a morphed image of how he can make my nose look and I loved it! He made my nose look even better than the morph and so natural to my face! He made my eyes and lips stand out even more, and I’m truly so thankful he helped fix my breathing problems and did my nose to suit my face. The day of surgery his staff and nurses all comforted me and made the surgery day less of a panic! I want to thank Doctor Omidi, Betty, Wary and his
Whole staff for being so kind and giving me a wonderful experience. I definitely recommend Doctor Omidi!</text>< Name>

Went in for filler to be placed on my under eye, nose, cheekbones and lip. I was a bit nervous being that it was my first time having filler all over by face, but when speaking to the Dr. I knew I was in good hands. I was very specific about how much I wanted everywhere and he did just that. Nearly no swelling occurred and my face looks great! Definitely recommending to my friends</Text>

<Review>I went to Dr. Omidi's Beverly Hills office for Botox and fillers. It was my first time getting fillers so needless to say, I was nervous. My injector Doris was AMAZING. She patiently answered all my questions and listened to the desired result I wanted. Waree and Betty at the front desk were probably the best staff I've ever encountered at any doctor's office. Thank you all for making my experience so wonderful!<//Review>< pics>

<Text>I had the most amazing experience with Michael Omidi and his staff. Most importantly, he was able to achieve the most beautiful, natural looking results. He and his staff really listened my my specific needs and desired result, and took the time to answer all my questions. This clinic gets 5 stars for being so knowledgeable, patient, helpful, and making me feel completely comfortable and welcomed. The whole team is really amazing. Michael Omidi is down to earth and easy to communicate with, while also being a master of his craft. I already recommended Michael and his office to all of my friends! Not only do they make you feel so comfortable and welcome, I also trust their competency 100%.. Whoever visits him will not be disappointed.</Text>< pictures>

One of the physicians assistants did tear trough filler on me at Michaels office and completely messed my face up. I asked many times to have a very small amount done, I did not want the entire ML put into my face and wanted to look natural. I called later to find they indeed put the entire ML in. I looked horrible and had to be put on augmentin after the service. It’s been 17 days since the service was done so swelling is not the issue. I was completely overfilled and now have to go to Skin By Lovely in Santa Monica to have it dissolved because I don’t trust anyone at this office to do anything else to me after seeing how disfigured this left my face. If you google “botched tear trough filler” I look like the 3rd photo in. Michael offered to dissolve it free of cost but as I said above I’ve lost complete trust in this office and never want to return. It’s disappointing to me that after such a horribly done job I was not refunded at all. This was fully the offices fault, the woman who injected me should not be injecting people. She didn’t listen to anything I said and obviously isn’t experienced enough and doesn’t have the right eye to be doing these services.< /Text>

<text>I'm literally in love with my nose!!! Ever since I could remember I was always self conscious with the appearance of my dorsal hump. This brought a toll to me because it was a feature that brought my confidence down. I would always try multiple ways of hiding it until I finally decided to see what could be done. Dr.Omidi was my #1 rhinoplasty surgeon who took his time to describe and help me understand the process of getting the nose I desired. I cannot explain the joy that came to me once I saw that dorsal hump removed and finally see the finish result. Dr.Omidi did an amazing job and thanks to him I can finally say that my confidence has boosted up tremendously! His work is beyond incredible and I would totally recommend his work. If I could give more than 5 stars I would 100% do!!!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

I really enjoy going to Dr. Omidi’s office. Everyone is so nice, professional, and knowledgeable. I have been  there several times for Botox, Juvederm, and a consultation for my daughter’s rhinoplasty. They have good deals on services and the consultation for her surgery was thorough, as he provided morphed photos to help her with her decision. One other great thing is that Dr. Omidi is such an expert. He explained things to me regarding the best place on my face for fillers. He actually showed me all the places our faces age first and best locations for Botox, too. I will return to this office and am a happy patient. Thanks, Dr. O!< /review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><text>I had a wonderful experience. I normally get Juvederm, and I went here to try Restalyne injections for my lips. What a difference! My lips look amazing! The check in process was a little tedious, but that's only because I'm a new patient, and I had to fill out my profile. So if you're a new patient, get there about 20 minutes before your appointment. I had two different people come to me to explain different procedures that their doctor does, which I didn't really like, but I get why they're doing it. I wish I would've had more time to discuss some other procedures that I'm really interested in with the doctor, but I'll just make another appointment. I LOVED that they helped me with pricing! I brought a groupon, and they matched the discount on groupon, which is KILLER!!! This was a gift to myself, and they really made me feel good about my purchase! I WILL be coming back, and I will be bringing referrals!<//text><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbf5c36b421d:0x6fd5053cb0f01235<//Gmap_id></record>

My review is long over due.  He is the best surgeon.  He did my breast augmentation 10 years ago was happy with results. I went to another surgeon for another procedure and was not happy with  results.  I went back to him and he patiently listened, and explained to me how he would revise the area.  I am so happy with results.  I personally he is a great doctor. His staff is amazing.< /Text><Rating>5</Rating>< gmap_id>

<Text>Dr. Omidi is not just like any other doctor. He made sure I was completely happy and followed up with me long after my care to ensure I was still happy. Stepping into his office is like becoming part of a family, and I’m so happy I ever did. Whether you are planning to come in for a major surgical make-over, or just to have Botox or a laser treatment, Dr. Omidi will make you feel prioritized. What a wonderful environment - no wonder they get such great results!</Text><name>Priscilla Hussain<//name><Gmap_id>0x80c2bbf5c36b421d:0x6fd5053cb0f01235<//Gmap_id>< Response>

Dr. Omidi is the absolute best! I have come to him for several procedures over the past 10 years, and he has never failed to surpass my expectations each and every time!  He has an excellent eye for asethetics and his work is phenomenal.  I am very, very happy with my results!

I'm a person who typically worries about anything and everything.  So I always appreciate how he answers my questions in great detail and seeks to ensure that I understand him completely.  He puts all my fears to rest.  He is extremely kind and caring, readily available, and I always leave his office feeling very comfortable and more confident.

If you're looking for a top quality surgeon, who is double Board Certified, with great bedside manners, who truly seeks after your best interest... I urge you to look no further! Dr. Michael Omidi is, hands down, the best there is!< /Text>

I meet Dr Omidi on March 2019 for first time. He is a very kind, knowledgeable and caring plastic surgeon. Not only that but his staff are caring and friendly.
He did my daughter’s Rhinoplasty surgery on April 2019. Her nose has totally changed, it is so beautiful and natural now. Dr. Omidi and his staff are always available to answer patient’s question at any time.
Last week, I did my Septoplasty and Rhinoplasty. The day after surgery I had a question, and I sent a text message to Dr. and he answered back to me saying he would open his office to check me when his office was closed due to thanksgiving holidays. I am really appreciative of what he did for me and my daughter. I can not wait to share my new nose’s picture.
Thank you Dr. Omidi. You are the best.<//text>

<review>Dr. Omidi is a caring and passionate surgeon. He is honest and upfront about everything. In addition, he is not like some other plastic surgeons who just want to perform hundreds of procedures on you and turn you into a fake looking person. His creativity turns you into a more beautiful you. I highly recommend dr. Omidi.<//review></record></dataset><record>

<review>I was referred to Dr. Omidi by a co-worker who had a tummy tuck done. I decided to go in for a consultation. Everyone in the office was very welcoming. I decided to have lift and implants (went from a B to a full C). I am very pleased with the results. I've already recommended Dr. Omidi to a few friends and would definitely come back for future procedures. It was a pleasure Dr. Omidi.< /review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Dr Omidi is one of the most thorough and attentive doctors I have met. He takes his time to explain everything, doesn't rush through eland thing and makes one feel like a human being as opposed to a number for a change.
Can't say enough good things about his knowledge and professionalism. Warmly recommended.<//review>

After much research, I decided to schedule a consultation with Dr. Omidi for a tummy tuck. It was my first and last consultation. I felt very comfortable with and assured that he was the doctor I wanted to go with and I have not regretted my decision one bit. Dr. Omidi is very kind and has a wonderful staff. I ended up getting the tummy tuck procedure with a fat transfer to the butt in April 2017 and I love my results! Although trying at times, which is to be expected, the process has been better than I anticipated.<//text>

I met Dr Omidi back in 2015 for a consultation. After consulting many MANY plastic surgeons within CA, AZ, CO over the past 10 years I finally connected with a Plastic Surgeon that I felt confident and comfortable with performing my tummy tuck. I am a nervous patient by nature and he took his time explaining and answering all my questions prior and leading up to my tummy tuck and gave me the care and patience after my tummy tuck. I immediately scheduled my appointment and booked my procedure.

I am 3 years post op. and my results are amazing! I’ve never felt more confident in my own skin than I do now. I now visit his office frequently for fillers and botox. I’ve had so many different doctors for these small procedures and never again will I go anywhere else for my botox and fillers.

What I love most about each of my experiences with Dr. Omidi is his passion, he is a visionary and is so passionate about giving his clients the results and goals they want to obtain. I can’t express how much Dr. Omidi goes over and beyond for each of his patients.
Not only is Dr. Omidi the best in his industry I have never felt more welcomed and cared for.

Dr. Omidi is the best doctor i could have ever chosen to perform my rhinoplasty. My nose looks exactly how i wanted it to look and also helped my breathing problems. The staff was also very nice and made me feel very comfortable.<//review>

After couple of consultation with other plastic surgeons when I met Dr. Omidi for the first time
I knew that I reached my destination.
He is not only an incredible surgeon, he is an awesome human being he gave me the confidence to go forward with the procedure I wanted.
He managed to cover everything within  less than a week concerning preop, he has an awesome team and I felt like I know him for years...I knew that I was in excellent hands.
I would recommend him to all my family and friends for any cosmetic and  reconstructive procedures they want to be done . I wish him the best .He deserves the title of the best surgeon< /review>

< Review>
My experience with Dr Omidi
Was like no other surgeon I have met before.

He is a true perfectionist, with a gifted vision an artist every step of the way.
From the initial phone call to scheduling the first consultation. Dr Omidi gave me time to voice my own concerns then he explain everything he saw.

I knew I was in the hands of someone who wanted the best for me. He never pressed me to move forward with the procedure. It wasn’t about just getting another patient .

I spent 4 years researching plastic and reconstructive surgeons. After being unhappy with two previous augmentation with unsatisfactory results,
more conveniently-located surgeons, experiencing cost, countless hours in multiple surgeries, recoveries... Finally my search stoped the moment I came across Dr Omidi
I deeply value his honesty

In Post Op his bedside manner was unparalleled. He checked on me frequently to make sure I was okay.

I have not felt this good about my body in years!
I can not begin to express how grateful I am for him and his incredible team. From anesthesiologist, to Daniela, Annika, Gerald, Chantal to name a few for being part of my life changing moment.

I have no doubt I’ve made an excellent decision.

If you are thinking of getting plastic surgery, schedule a consultation and see for yourself.
***** Highly recommended*****</Review>

After having four consultations and still unsure if I wanted to go through with my surgery, I gave it one more chance and came in to see Dr. Omidi. I can't even begin to explain how comfortable he made me feel, explaining all steps and answering all my questions. He took all my concerns and worries away after my consultation. I scheduled my surgery two weeks after, and was so excited. Everything I asked the doctor to do, he did. My results are amazing and I couldn't be more happy! I'm so happy I picked Dr. Omidi, I have no regrets and love my new nose/look. Thanks doc!!!< /Review>

<Text>After having my second baby, I was feeling very insecure about my body. I met with several doctors, but was turned off for one reason or another, until I scheduled a consult w Dr. Omidi. The staff was very welcoming and made me feel comfortable from the moment I called to book an appointment all the way through post-surgery. Dr. Omidi is a skilled surgeon and a true artist, and really cares about his patients.
I absolutely recommend him and his staff! Thank you for giving me back my confidence, and making me feel like myself once again!</Text>< Gmap_id>

Dr Michael Omidi has been my “go to” Dr for many years. His work is art and his staff is like family to me. They all take such good care of me and never make me feel uncomfortable. Dr Omidi cares about his patients and staff and that’s shows a lot about his character. I couldn’t ask for a better surgeon.</Review>

I decided to get a procedure done with Dr. Omidi because a close friend had recommended me him, i'm very glad I was able to decide on Dr.Omidi to do procedure on me for an ear otoplasty, I was very worried and scared since it was my first procedure ever, but Dr. Omidi and his team and were able to answer all my questions and concerns about the procedure and what I should expect, I am more than satisfied with the results and I would definitely recommend Dr. Omidi for any type of procedure in the near future, it's only been a few weeks since my surgery and I've been loving the results more and more as each day goes by! Thank you Dr. Omidi and his team!<//Text>

<Review>So i had my first appointment Yesterday and  his staff made me feel so comfortable to be there. ..

BUT!! why is it that i have to wait foooorrr eeevvveerrr!! and the lady that helped me was going crazy with everything going on. Once i got there all i hear is other patients complaining in the waiting area.

i don't know about you guys but when a patient in the waiting area is talking about how they paid off other patients with bad results it made me very uncomfortable.

Don't think ill be coming back here.<//Review>< Pictures>

I came in and he told me I need surgery done right away befor the bone starts healing the wrong way. I didnt know my insurance lapsed and was cancelled until that happened. He went in and did the surgery pro bono anyway and aligned the bones together so it will heal straight. I really appreciate the thought that he put my situation on top of everything else. Now, my hand is back to its original state with no deformities. He also made me feel at home and very comfortable as he saw I was anxious because it is my first surgery ever. He explained the whole procedure in very simple terms that I understood every single part of it.< /Text></record>

< Review>
When things go according to plan, it is easy to give 5 stars, but the true test of a company is the authority it gives to their employees to do the right thing and fix an unplanned situation for the customer.  Here's what happened...

I had a GREAT experience with RV&AP and if you get an opportunity to work with Crystal, you will wish for 6 stars to rate her here!  My order came earlier than expected, but the box was torn open during shipping and it was missing two key parts.  I called Crystal, she sent a return-ship request (free to me) and then sent me a replacement.  The replacement came unharmed and I installed the Reese Puck system on my F-250.

While the first box did not come as planned, the key here is that it was not RV&AP's fault, but they did right by me and fixed the situation in a timely manner.  THAT is how a GREAT company operates!

Thank you Crystal!  I will be back!!!--Jeremie</Review>

<user_name>Mike Car</user_name><Text>8/17 confirmed item was in stock before purchase, placed order almost month later, nothing at all.
Buyer beware, unless your willing to wait months and get the run around.
Same hood purchased says in stock guess it’s a common practice by this company to bait and switch and claim it’s on backorder.

No apology or anything, why have employees that do nothing. Place is a scam if your looking to waste your time and playing the waiting game
RVautoparts.com is a great place to get nothing</Text></record></dataset><record>

I did not read any reviews of RV and Auto until after I had received my order. I ordered an Equalizer hitch that cost $657 everywhere else. I paid $422 at RV and Auto. I was skeptical of this price, so I called and emailed the company to make sure it was the right part at that price. Their communications were very quick responses and made me feel comfortable so I ordered the hitch. When I received the hitch from UPS, the box was damaged (weighs like 80 lbs). I unpacked the boxes and there was a part missing. I contacted Michelle at RV and Auto and she tried to find the missing part to send it to me but was unable. She sent me a link to order it directly from the manufacturer and she refunded the cost of this part plus shipping to my paypal account immediately. This missing part was not RV Auto's mistake since UPS damaged the box, but Michelle was very quick to solve my issue. I don't know where all the bad reviews came from, but I found just the opposite from my experience. This company has excellent prices and exemplary customer service. Good job RV and Auto!<//Text>

<text>Recently had an issue with how my order was handled during shipping and the damage that was incurred. Called and talked to Crystal and she was very helpful, knowledgeable and courteous. Like many of you, customer service online can be challenging and it was refreshing to call and actually talk to a person about my issue and receive excellent customer support. Will continue to rely on them for my RV needs.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I recently ordered parts for my truck, from RV and Auto Parts. Upon installing it was found that one part had a manufacturers defect. Michelle at RV and Auto Parts was EXTREMELY helpful in getting a replacement sent out to me quickly, and efficiently without hassle. Customer service is top notch!! I’ll definitely do business with them in the future!!< /review>

<review>I had a poor experience with this company. All because they shipped a duplicate helmet I was nice enough to email them to send a return label. Experience below:

1.) I placed original order - paid on time.

2.) Order shipped

3.) When order arrives, turns out RV agents duplicate order (Mistake one)

4.) I was "honest" enough to message about extra helmet

5.) All I received was a return label and sent back helmet. Apparently, I should have done RV person's job and leave a message on the invoice it was a duplicate and just a return. Since there wasn't a note their system about it (which is weird). Causing the mess or they should have sent instruction on what needed to be done not just a return label.

6.) RV without a heads up, email, or call decided they would refund me from the original charge (another mistake), figure out what they did, and then try to correct it by sending me an invoice (without an email explaining it - third mistake).

7.) ALL I SAW WAS RV MESSING WITH MY ACCOUNT. I had to do research to see why they sent me an invoice. Lucky I figured it out and am understanding, or I would have put in a fraud alert. I paid the invoice and received my first email "Thanks so much for your honesty in paying the invoice I sent you." What honesty? I did what I should have done but they did not.

8.) It's done now, I will not deal with the company again which is sad since the helmet was what I was looking for (hence the two star). In the future they should send an emails explaining the transaction "We are refunding you for your return of ..." or "We made an error, please pay invoice of $$ for original order." By-the-way, PayPal was the one notifying me about "RV & Auto Parts" transaction.

9.) I don't like dealing with companies that do things with money (especially mine) without communicating. Conduct business at your own risk. This was a simple situation that didn't need to be this way.< /review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

<review>Today, April 14, 2021, I have finally contacted the Attorney General of the State of California and the Riverside District Attorney to file a consumer complaint about RV & Auto Parts.  I have been dealing with this company for repair, return or refund of a faulty Splendide washing machine I purchased through Amazon since mid October of 2020.  My letters, calls and emails have been ignored.  There has never been a resolution, and they have my machine now, purchased on August 27, 2020.  They will not give it back, nor repair it nor refund the $1,021.23.  I cannot purchase another machine as I do not have the money to do so as they will not refund my money for the faulty machine they have now in their possession since December 2, 2020.  I am seeking resolution.< /review><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

No way to check or cancel your order online, no responses to emails. In the backorder email it says my payment method has not been charged and that is a blatant lie as I was charged as soon as the order was made. I've contacted through email twice and made a case with PayPal. I ordered because it said the item was in stock and I need it ASAP, I cant wait for an item on backorder, I need my money back as soon as possible to purchase the item from somewhere else. If the owner of RV and Auto Parts or an employee of the company is reading this, please cancel order #R-427735 immediately.<//Text>

<review>After ordering new running boards for $100 cheaper than any other company...well let's just say I was skeptical. Then, I read some negative reviews and got worried. But let me tell you the product shipped fast within a few days of ordering. I spoke with customer service to confirm order was being shipped and they were very helpful. Zero issues with this company. Will buy from them again.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>My mistake, I should have read reviews. Apparently this company notoriously sells things that aren’t in stock. I ordered some caliber snowmobile ramps on 12/23/20. Said it would be in stock on 12/25. Money was taken out of my account immediately. I called on 12/29 and was told they sold out upon arrival and the next delivery which would take place on 1/4 would fulfill my order. It’s now 1/6 and have no information. No response to email, called and left a message and no return call either. Poor communication.<//Text><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None</Pictures><name>Corey Aiello</name><user>106086370951415414568</user><Time>1609959679411</Time></record>

RV & Autoparts had the best price on a Reese Sidewinder Pinbox. We purchased and immediately started getting communication via email on the purchase confirmation and shipping. Shipping was quick (and free), which was surprising because the part we ordered was 200lbs+. Overall great experience, would order from them again--no issues.<//text>

<review>Quick delivery and excellent, responsive customer service. A box was damaged in shipment and the seller quickly helped me determine if anything was missing (nothing was). Then they gave me an unsolicited credit of $75 for my inconvenience.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I ordered a Revarc snowmobile ramp on 10/21 and it arrived on 10/27.  It sounds like others have had different experiences so it made me a little nervous ordering from them, but they had the best price so I took a chance.  Sure the shipment notification email was a couple days behind, as well as the delivery notification email, but I have no complaints, yet.  I have yet to use it, but I opened it and looked at it.  Other than some minor scuffing from transport I assume, it seems to work as advertised.  So bottom line, if you can be patient and not expect regular/timely emails after the initial order email, I think 6 days for coast to coast shipping is pretty darn good.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response><Gmap_id>0x80dbe921c07e0af7:0xe269de81ad2a6bdf< /Gmap_id></record>

<Text>Guys, this place simply rocks! I’ve shopped for car and RV stuff for decades and can honestly tell you that the customer service here is super good. Quickest replies and shipping I’ve ever seen from any only store and I buy a lot from many places online. Oh, and have a look at all these low prices too! Simply mind blowing to think how anyone can be so low on so much and yet still keep the doors open. But they do.

Look, you’re not going to go wrong in ordering from this place. You can expect the best because you’re shopping at the best when you shop here. This place is the best I’ve seen so far and that’s based on several aspects that matter to me. Aspects like quality parts, knowledgeable, courteous customer service a selection that’s mind boggling and super fast shipping to boot.

Look, my experience shopping here has been a 10 star kind of experience. So much so that I am sure you can expect the same. If you need help, just contact them and boom help is quickly given. Have questions? Ask and they will work hard at quickly getting you the answer you need. I highly recommend this store and believe you will too once you’ve shopped here.

Honestly, you can spend with confidence here because the products are all top notch and at a price you simply can’t beat too.

There’s NO JUNK SOLD here like you can quickly find on some sites that will obviously cost you more and just leave you disappointed and waiting on a reply. Totally not the case here guys.

Yes! I’ll be shopping here as often as I can, because my experience here has really stood out as this being high quality store in every aspect that matters.

Seriously, this place really does stand above the rest when it comes to price, customer service and shipping.

Bravo RV and Auto Parts. You’ve built a a winning team and their efforts really shine through every aspect of e commerce.

Now, I want to speak to that new to here customer. You know, the one that reads all the reviews before shopping. Yes, I want to speak directly to you. I really hope you can disregard and get past the negative reviews you might find here. Some people simply can’t be pleased no matter what and those kinds of people all seem to love dropping nasty reviews and all in hope of you sharing in their misery. Don’t do it. Just go shopping and be happy like me okay?

Just put those items you want and need in the shopping cart and go check out with confidence. The RV and Auto Parts team will always do their best to get you what you order in record time and at a price that will make any online store mad at them for doing it so well. Again, this place simply rocks.

This is a GREAT STORE, I’ll be back and as often as possible too. I really think you will too after shopping here.

Respectfully and sincerely,
1 Happy Customer.

< Review>
I purchased a Crossbar for my Roof Rack from their amazon store. They sent me a “New” in the original box item. I thought it would be unopened. I got an open box that was re-taped closed.  I didn’t mind that as much as all the missing parts. They sent me a open box with missing parts for full asking price on Amazon.  On top of that I had to contact amazon because I didn’t get my refund in a timely manner. Be aware when ordering from this company.</Review>

<Text>Orders form them in the past with no issues. However o ordered a roof rack from them in August. In came in with a torn up box that looked like it was a previous return with no hardware, I was ok with this and asked if they can send me a hardware pack, they said no and ask to ship it back. They set up pickup and it was picked up. The “second” rack was lost according to their customer service. So she said they will send another one. What arrived today was literally the original torn up box with another box over it. I checked to see if maybe they put the hardware in there, nope. So they sent me the same rack twice, with missing parts. So I ordered beginning of August and it’s mid September and I don’t have a rack. Not sure what’s going on with them but not very happy.....<//Text>< username>

I highly recommend NOT doing business with this business.  I ordered a roof bike rack and I got the confirmation email.  About 2 weeks later I emailed them to find out about my order with no response.  3 weeks later I called and went straight to voicemail so I left a message with my order number, etc.  Never got a response.  About a week later I was finally able to get a hold of someone on the phone.  The told me that my order was cancelled over the phone 2 days after I ordered the product.  I never got a hold of them until over 3 weeks later so I didn't cancel the order.  Luckily they refunded the money.  The lady on the phone was nice, but their communication was horrible.  I have no idea why my order was cancelled.<//review>

I purchased a dog carrier for my motorcycle from RV and Auto Parts online. I later realized that I would need another for my husband's motorcycle to take both of our pups along with us. The service was excellent. The orders were 7 days apart but delivery was only two days apart. The carriers were wrapped in plastic, airbags inserted to keep the shape of the leather during shipment, then boxed with extra packing. It was a very smooth easy transaction.<//review>

I came to write a great review for this place. I was nervous after seeing all the poor reviews on here, on whether or not I would get my RV part. Let me tell you that I received it fast and had no problems whatsoever! The company may have been struggling at the beginning of the pandemic with the sudden increase in demand (RV boom happened), but I would say that they seem to be back on track with things. I would recommend this place.<//text>

I was skeptical ordering from here, but boy did I receive a great deal and it shipped fast.  I think folks don't realize how the industry works. Most items that you order online are dropped shipped.  That's probably why there are so many negative reviews for this store.  It's nearly impossible to have every single item on your website in stock, and just sitting there. I'll definitely be ordering again from RV and Auto Parts. Thank you guys, you rock!!!!<//review>

Just another faceless online place to take your order and money and then that's it. No response to emails. Order and then nothing happens but a lame email acknowledging your order.   1 day after ordering no update no way to check shipping or status or know if your part is in stock and coming or how long you might be waiting.  DO not expect any follow up or customer service. Place your order and wonder.  Prices aren't that good to wonder if you might actually get what you ordered. 1st time and last time ordering here.<//text>

I received excellent service!
I ordered for an Onan 5500 RV generator for an unbelievably low price and an unbelievably low shipping rate.  The exact generator I ordered arrived sooner than I had anticipated (over a week earlier), well packed on a pallet, that was delivered with an electric pallet jack, right into my garage.
RV and Auto Parts has a new loyal customer!</text>

<review>Should have read reviews first! I got scammed as well. In the checkout and Apple Pay it said $0 shipping, then my email receipt said $16.50 shipping! Called immediately and emailed within 5 minutes, then two times after and no response. It's like they want to ignore you, process the order, and charge a bunch of fees! I contacted my credit card to stop it within 10 minutes as well so we will see what happens. Sticking to Amazon for now on!<//review><rate>1<//rate><Pics>None</Pics>< user>

The company is real, they have great prices. I have made 2 purchases, BUT the service is terrible. Both times no update on shipping. I had to call and get updates. I ordered parts on Aug 2nd and won't see them until Aug 24th, they don't know what happened.

If you have lots of time to call and bother them then this place is for you.</text>

Ordered some fender flares that had a typo in the description on the website and thus wouldn't fit my truck.  Their Customer Service was very understanding and went above and beyond to make it right.<//text>

When I first was notified by USPS that it was delivered I checked my mailbox and only had a completely empty business envelope from this company. No shifting knob, no paperwork, nothing.
I called the company and their representative I spoke to was very pleasant and quickly notified me it was a mix up and that they would next-day ship the part immediately.
Just received the part and I love it. Mistakes happen and I'm very happy with how the whole situation was handled</review>< username>

Well I have to say, based on some of the recent reviews I was certainly skeptical about how my purchase would go. I placed my order on a Saturday and on Monday morning I recieved my shipping info. I had a question about the order and my email was responded to quickly. 2 days later I received a call to sent up my freight delivery for the next day. Shipper arrived within the scheduled time. Product was exactly what I ordered with no issues. It was an absolute perfect purchase. Thank you and I will definitely be doing business here again.</Review>

<Text>Still waiting on my part. Been 18 days. Should've read these reviews before I made the purchase. I'm in the middle of a move and living in my RV with out plumbing, waiting on this part. This situation is just not worth the two bucks I saved buying from rvautoparts. It's easy to blame the Covid pandemic, and USPS, but I've had other parts delivered within the same time frame, from other vendors.< /Text>< Pics>

List items they don't really have in stock.Then two days later they email you to say not in stock. False Advertising. They charged you card and no answer. Read all the bad reviews terrible customer service. Like the other posts mentioned, this is a fraudulent company. They do not stock anything that is listed.</text>

Item was (and still is) listed as "in stock". I made sure of that after reading the other reviews. I was charged for my purchase, and then received an e-mail claiming that the item was listed as "on backorder". Judging from the other reviews, this appears to be common practice at RV and Auto Parts< /review>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>These are the days you want to support your local businesses.  Made an order online,  PIF.  Received my confirmation email of my purchase which stated a follow up with come with my shipping #.  Tried calling to see if I can just pick up my order being local, No one picked up, so I sent a follow up email... and that is where it all went down hill.  No one answers the phone, no one responds to emails. Open hours state after 8 am. Took a couple days after 1 pm (they set a VM stating at lunch at noon), to be placed on 15 + mins holds, to be hung up on, calling back , to hold again for 15+ mins.  FINALLY a person answer to say my order is coming from a 3rd party, out of LA and "I should have received my tracking number".  She stated it has been shipped. NOTHING Arrives again-no email, no order... waited 3 days Called and again long holds, drop call, to call and wait again to be told in fact NO my order did not ship, they don't have any idea on the status and said I would receive a call back by 1 pm the next day.  I wait again NO CALL BACK.  I, again, called to go through the same issues, no one there after 8 am- phone just rings rings then drops, a voicemail set to pick up at noon stating they are at lunch, and then after 1 pm, my call picked, up to be told hold OVER 20 MINS!  At this point, I requested to cancel, this is horrible customer service, the order has not been fulfilled and told again "they have no idea , and can't get a hold of their vendor".  An requested an email confirmation.  Waited 1 day, no email, called again and FINALLY received the email while I waited on the phone, to received a FULL refund by Monday 6/1...... and it is past the 6/1 and NO REFUND!  I truly wanted to support a local business but just like the prior reviewers, it has been a stressful and horrible experience!  Bad customer service, no follow up, my order was not fulfilled and I felt passed around, lied to, no one had a straight answer and still at the end, they have not corrected this my refunding my money.   BEWARE!</text>< Pics>

Don’t recommend this site. Ordered a 12 v battery from them online that I cannot find elsewhere, and they ended up canceling it after emailing me asking me to reach out. They did not answer the phone or email for days. They claimed it was cancelled because it was marked fraudulent..? 4 days after I made the order and when I found out it was cancelled, I replaced the order and noted to have them reach out to me for any issues with my payment. I screen shotted the new order to the representative who lacked good communication during the cancellation of my order. She immediately responds to me over email telling me that the battery has been discontinued and that I would be refunded a second time. So moral of the story is that It seems no one is willing to answer the phone or call back on voicemails and hardly on emails even when they requested I reach out to them originally. I also not impressed with the fact that I got two different excuses for the same product within days of each other. I don’t understand why products on your site are available for purchase if they are unavailable or discontinued..< /text>

They do not honor their purchases.  Waited more than 24 hours to tell me they were out of stock, after confirming the order via email.  Strong ditto to other customers who had bad online experiences - they simply cannot honor their online purchases.  Do not recommend.< /Text>

I was searching for a particular HKS exhaust using Google. RV and Auto parts has the best price. Although the product page says backorder, I was still able to place the order. A couple of hours later I received an email saying the product is out of stock. They can do a special order for me, but at a higher price.

I then come back to their site and searched for all HKS Exhaust System Kit. There are 8 listed on their website and 6 of them say backorder. What a shaddy way to do business.</Text>

Abysmal experience.  Placed an order for a slideout gearbox.  Paid +100 for overnight delivery.  Called them and left a message to seek callback.  Wanted verbal confirmation they understood this had to go next day air.  Tracked order and was notified by UPS that sender (RV and auto parts) sent the product too late so 1 day delay.  Got some meaningless apology from them stating it wasn’t deliberate.  Reminded me of my child explaining they didn’t mean to sneak a cookie.  Then when product got to my home state hub, it was returned because somebody over there is too careless to write legibly.  Another meaningless apology.  Cancelling order.  I have proof of this comedy of errors.  I write this on 8/2 (4 days after my original order where I paid next day air).  I’m in my RV, no new part from company.  They suck.< /Text>

Item was incorrect and the pallet was broken with no straps holding inccorrect pinbox on. Contacted this company and was given the runaround about why I recieved the wrong pinbox. I had to bring the pinbox to work and palletize it with proper strapping to ship back to the warehouse.  What a PAIN!! A week later I had to contact them to get my refund.

< Review>
Terrible service. Would give zero stars if I could. I left phone messages and sent emails about missing items from my shipment. Finally spoke to someone after waiting in hold for 20 mins. Their answer was that this part was not included when the description on their web site clearly stated it was. I asked for some help on the price of the missing part and they said they could reduce my shipping cost to $9 but they had very little margin and could not reduce the cost of the item. I went I eBay and got it brand new for $10 less with free shipping! Buyer beware!!!<//Review>

< review>
As stated by a few reviewers below, this website is very likely a scam website. I made a purchase at the advertised price for a product then they sent me an email a few days later requesting me to pay over twice the listed price before they’ll ship it.

Please avoid at all costs, and if you do purchase use PayPal as a means of protection.</review>

Lou Martin del Campo prepping info was good and Christian/site foreman was very professional. We appreciated Christian and the crew raising possible concerns on the day of the job (steep roof and solar panels) rather than just proceeding. The clean up was good and we appreciated the card taken with our garden. Thank you!<//Review>

Benny at Terminix came out today to do an inspection of our house and check for termite damage.  He was thorough, professional, very helpful and kind.  I have been so happy with our quarterly service with Terminix, and Benny just made me happier to be a repeat customer!  Thanks Benny - you rock!</text>

I am pleased with terminix as always. Their technicians are always upbeat, happy, and extra courteous. The tech went the extra mile and made sure all my windows and doors were closed and locked before he left. Then sent me a message letting me know he did so. As always, I think prices and options could be a little better for the customer even though terminix is better priced than all the others. There is always room for improvement. All in all terminix does not disappoint.</review>

Man, these guys put it down! They give you a call or text the day before they are supposed to show up for service to make sure day and time works for you. If it doesn't you can reschedule for a day and time that does work. It's super easy and they take great care when entering your property. Give them a call you wont regret it.< /review>

We have been using Terminix for many years for general bug control and recently had a bee issue so we naturally called them out.  They sent an inspector out (Nate) and he said it would be $690 which we agreed to pay.  They sent Scott to do the work.  Days later and weeks later bees are still there, I have notified the inspector Nate and texted with Davina, Ashley and Scarlett at their office, since they don't pick up their phones, multiple times and they completely ignored the issue or responded and provided no solution and they never sent anyone back.  HORRIBLE customer service and will never use them again.  We were long time customers and I always recommended them, but they have completely changed and service is terrible.<//review>

<Text>Terminix is a greatcompany for pest control!! They’re punctual and respectful! I love my technician and we have built a mutual trust!! One important thing to remember is; it takes a few months of monthly service to see complete results. You won’t see the difference on the first visit, but for us, by month 4 or 5, we were pest FREE!! I would recommend them to anyone!</Text>< Gmap_id>

The technician is very friendly, always calling ahead of time letting you know the appointment is near.  They seem like they care about the customers and love their job.  Finally their product works great, havent had issues with any insects since hiring Terminix.</Text>

Rep was very knowledgeable and professional. He also offered advice on other services by the company without being pushy and trying to sell something that may not be needed (like other companies who shall remain nameless) to make a sales quota.< /Review>

I dont reccomend Terminix. Sales rep Mark was so assuring and nice when he came to do the inspection, which is why I chose terminix over other companies that had actaully quoted less to fumigate our home. (Terminix started off at $2771 for a 2 story 1700 sq ft home- tent for drywood termites. Got them down to $1850 with 2 year warranty)
I guess after Mark got the sale, that was it, didnt care anymore. Said I could text him with any questions. I did, 5 questions thru out 4 days and never got a reply. Called and never got an answer or call back.

Worse part was, we were scheduled for a Wednesday morning, had our whole house ready- all food bagged and packed up, gas company already shut off gas, hotel rooms booked. No one shows up, Mark said that someone in another department 'forgot' to schedule us. MAJOR inconvienece, but Mark apologized and said he'd give us a discount. Got us scheduled for the next day. Later only offered an extra year warranty. We didnt need that, he said discount, so that's what we needed. Because we had to book an extra hotel night. Still havent heard back or resolved the 'discount' for the major inconvenience.

Honestly wish I had gone with a different company. Sure was a good pitch, after that no assurance or help what so ever.</text>

Experience from beginning to end was very professional, informative and prompt. I received email updates on the techs arrival with information of his name and picture which I absolutely love as it’s a safe secure way to ID the person arriving to your residence. Updates on service provided were also sent to my email. The Tech was very nice and professional. He provide details on what he was going to do, what he did and what he found needed to be done. I retained their services for a year with quarterly  visits due to the ant, spider and mosquito issues we have in our area. After the first visit we all noticed a dramatic change. I highly recommend this service.</review>

<Review>Company representative by the name of German, came out to inspect home and failed to follow any safety procedures.  Walk throughout my property and the inside of my home without wearing a mask . Was not clear about service and pricing ,but was quick to collect my credit card and set up an account without my knowledge. I have 3 children at home one sufers from asthma. This comopany was brought in to keep our home pest ,vermin ,and disease free  . Really disappointed with Terminix for not implementing most current safety and basic guidelines.  My home was the last appointment of the day.  Makes me cringe when I think of how nany other properties he visited. I have surveillance footage of this man wiping his nose without gloves and continue inspection.
I have contacted Terminix and canceled my unconsented agreement and explained the issue . They fixed all my issues with an apology bs.</Review><Date>1593539630721< /Date><Pictures>None< /Pictures><user_name>Francisco Valera<//user_name>< UserId.>

The Terminix technician was very professional and thorough.  He communicated that he would be able to provide the services to our home on a certain date and time and arrived at the appointed time.  He accurately described the tasks he would provide, performed as promised and left us a report.  I have been pleased with the service that Terminix has provided over the years and highly recommend them.< /text>

DO NOT get this service. The worst customer service I have ever had from a company in my 32 years of life. I used to think Sears was bad but my God I will never get Terminix again I recommend going with another company.<//Review>

Not even worthy of one star. Made an appointment online for a termite inspection.No one from the company called to confirm. Day of appointment, sales person from the Santa Fe Springs office, Edwin, texted to say he was running late but would be there; this was still within the 2-hour window they gave me, annoying, but not unreasonable. When he finally arrives and I show him termite droppings in garage he says those are old, you've had an infestation for a long time, you can tell because the droppings are a dark color. Yes, we know we've had an infestation for awhile, but the garage is actually framed in redwood which makes the droppings a dark color. He proceeds to walk around the house "inspecting" using the flashlight on his phone. He does a cursory "inspection" in the attic, failing to notice we actually have two separate attic spaces due to an addition. He spends 5 minutes walking the perimeter of the house, failing to notice the active infestation we have in the fascia. He never even bothered to go under the house to look for subterranean termites, which we know we have. So after the 20-minute "inspection",  I get the sales pitch which is basically the cost of the tenting and the special spray that causes termites to die when they land on the treated surface (Really? Rolling my eyes). When I say I need to discuss with my partner, and ask for the estimate to be emailed to me, he types some more on his tablet and presents the "special discount price" which my credit card will "guarantee" for 3-days, if I decide to cancel in that time, no problem, my card will not be charged. Trying not to laugh out loud, I again say I need to think about it, and to please send me the estimate. I try to ask him some questions about security during tenting. He completely dismisses my concerns, "what are you worried about, there's nothing in here" (we are in the process of remodeling).  I said I was concerned about vandalism, and stealing fixtures. He laughs, "Oh, fixtures, that's funny". Maybe he didn't know that meant lighting, hardware, etc.?  The patronizing, unprofessional, disrespectful attitude irritates me, but worse, I'm sure many people fall for these sales tactics.  Terminix used to have a great reputation. If you are thinking about using this company, do your research, and carefully consider the other reviews online.<//review>

<name>Karina Cordova< /name><review>Paul Andrade from Terminix called to remind me of my scheduled service two days prior. I wasn’t going to be home, he let me know it wasn’t a problem and to leave the gate unlock to treat the back. I would highly recommend him. The day prior I made sure my kids outdoor toys were put away. I didn’t realized I had forgot to moved their chairs from the porch. When I arrived home the service had been completed and I noticed the chairs had been moved. I appreciate the care demonstrated through this action. The safety of my family is highly important to me and this was one of the reasons I was reluctant to join when I first did, but I am reassured I made the right choice to have joined.<//review><Rate>5< /Rate></record></dataset><record>

<text>We recently noticed some termite droppings around the window of our daughters room and I immediately began doing some online research on how best to handle the problem. I went on Home Advisor website as we had previously used their service to hire a roofing company and we were very satisfied with the process. Home Advisor connected us with 3 different companies and throughout the week we received our quotes. I was very surprised to find that Terminix had given us the best price lower by several hundred dollars for Tent Fumigation. Edwin from Terminix was very knowledgeable and gave us several options  on how to deal with our termite problem, he explained everything thoroughly  and in a simple manner. The day of fumigation Andy and his team were very polite and on time, we have 2 small children and we were still trying to get them ready for the mini vacation we took since we would have to leave our home for a few days. Andy gave us time to ready ourselves and did not rush us. Andy messaged me when him and his team had left our home and informed that I could turn on my home alarm. On the day we came back home we were surprised to find several items that we had forgotten to bag for the fumigation had been bagged by Andy and his team. We really appreciate that they did this for us even though they didn’t have to. We are very satisfied with the Price, Profesionalism, and Excellent Customer service provided to us by Terminix and we would definitely recommend them to our friends and family.<//text>< pictures>

<text>Don't waste your time trying to contact any other company. After calling four different companies, both large and small, including those recommended by friends and neighbors, I was getting no where. Those other companies never even returned my calls. Finally, after weeks of living with my pest problem, my leasing agent told me to call Terminix.

I was able to reach a representative on first try and scheduled by inspection to take place within days of my call. The technician was on time, communicative and knowledgeable. I've had four other home maintenance companies work in my condo since I've leased it and none of them have been efficient, on time or friendly until Terminix.

The technical was friendly and he took the time to listen to my concerns and to educate me on causes and prevention.

I am sold on Terminix and will never contract with or refer any other pest control company again.

Thank you Terminix for helping to achieve more peace of mind in my new home.< /text>< Pics>

I would rate 0 if I can. Extremely unpunctual, unprofessional, and unresponsive. My project needed the worker come 2 times in total but I had to schedule 5 appointments because he failed to show up for 3 times! He only showed up on the 3rd and 5th appointment! And every time if I didn't contact the sales person Brandon asking why, no one from the company took the initiative to contact me. They did initiatively charge me in full right after the first visit. And after the 3rd time no-show I was promised $200 refund because of this. But as of now it is been 3 weeks since the work is completed I still not receive the money. Brandon never actively get this processed. Every time when I message him asking about the progress the answer is always "it needs my boss's approval and I am waiting for his reply". I am so disappointed with the service.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><name>VictorWendy MY</name><userid>109676894000149183968< /userid>< response>

<Text>I’ve been with Terminix for years, but I’ve been trying to get an inside service done and they have missed three windows of service. NO CALL NO SHOW!
I’ve also been trying to get an initial service done for another property and their reps keep mixing up times and the addresses. But what good is setting up appointment times when they can’t even keep them.
Incompetency at every level!

Very unhappy with their service! We agreed on a day and made me take everything out of my kitchen. Didn't show up the day of service, I called the office and they had me for another day I didn't agree on. I tried getting someone asap and they had me back and fourth. Then came without telling me and when they did come I was not home and my brother was, and they didn't do what they were suppose to. I till this day (Saturday), since Wednesday have my stuff out in my living room and haven't been able to use my kitchen to Cook. Very bad service!!! I called the inspector that came to my house to ask about when they are coming, he answered very rudely, got mad and said he was going to cancel my contract when we didn't even have one yet. His name was David Montoya, a Licensed Field Inspector. I do not recommend this company at all!! Very poor service and bad communication skills within the employees themselves 👎</Review>

<time>1538594000062< /time><rate>5<//rate><Text>With our home in Escrow and quickly approaching the Closing the Buyers challenged the Terminix Inspection Report and demanded the house be fumigated.  Mike Casey, Sr. Warranty Department Inspector, quickly came to my rescue. Within two (2) days of my request and without any hassle (since we had the Terminix Annual Inspection Warranty Insurance) Mike orchestrated an absolutely remarkable feat of getting a fumigation team lined up to treat the home.  Once the fume was done he also made sure any roofline repairs were made.  Everything was done to meet the escrow closing deadline without any cost to me.  This is the kind of performance that truly represents a great company.  Mike demonstrated that Terminix cares for customers (he was easy to reach and returned my calls) and the company will do whatever is necessary to mitigate a crisis to keep customers satisfied. Termites are a nuisance and people really need to protect their homes. I will be using the Terminix Annual Inspection Warranty on my next home and Mike's business card will remain in my wallet as a symbol of someone who is truly a modern day "Mover and Shaker" who works hard to get things done quickly and correctly.

This is to extend my very special thanks to Mike and all the other Support Staff and to Terminix for standing behind their warranty in my time of great need.</Text>< pics>

This company has always let us know well ahead of time that the appointment is coming up so we can plan around it. When they arrive, they always check with us for any special instructions or problem areas that need attention. The spraying takes very little time, but the customer service is the important part. We can always count on Terminix to listen and we never have problems with spiders or bugs. They do a terrific job!< /Review>

This horrible company took total advantage of my elderly Father. He signed a termite contract with them but a couple years later, my Mother passed away and he didn't get around to scheduling a termite inspection. Understandably, since he was sad and grieving. He didn't get around to scheduling an inspection the year after either, since he fell into some health problems of his own.

TERMINIX, continued to collect his money anyway, and did not refund his money for services not rendered. No inspections, no treatments, no nothing. But they continued to collect his money anyway.

A couple of years later, my Father unfortunately passed away as well. I ended up taking over his property, got an inspection by another company, and they told me that the termites had done extensive damage to the house. I kindly asked TERMINIX to refund my Father's money for the past few years that he was not serviced.

Martin Macias, who was the representative who I was working with, refused to refund it!

Shame on you, TERMINIX!!

Listing your full-service address and the phone number associated with the account?'}<//response><pictures>None< /pictures><review>I scheduled a 10am-12pm window back on Monday for an inspection.

I was waiting for 2 hours, but didn't hear anything.

I called dispatch. The dispatcher called the driver and told me Marlin was 25 minutes away and on his way. I requested he call when he's a few minutes away as there were special parking and entry instructions. She said she'd call him again and tell him.

30 minutes later I didn't hear anything. So I waited longer. After an hour I called in. The dispatcher said the inspector was only doing a roach inspection and that's why he might not have shown up since they don't do write-ups for roach inspections.

I said that's not what I was told. So she asked a manager and said write-ups for roach inspections were at the inspector's discretion. Some do them and some don't.

I asked her to call the inspector. She couldn't reach him. She said he was behind. But I said I still wanted the service.

At 2pm no one showed up. I called back. The dispatcher told me a previous dispatcher had cancelled the service much earlier. I was livid. I told her every dispatcher told me the inspector was still on his way and I always said I still wanted the service. I asked how this could happen and she said they're poorly trained.

Because of this I needlessly wasted 4 hours of my time.

She offered to reschedule for this upcoming Thursday from 1-3pm. I was disappointed but figured I’d give them one more shot.

Fast forward to Wednesday (the day before) and I get a call that afternoon from an inspector telling me I wasn’t home and asking if he had the right address. After calling him back, I was furious but realized it wasn’t his fault.

When I called Terminix they saw the notes they were supposed to schedule on Thursday from 1-3pm but put me down for Wednesday from 1-3pm.

I am done with this company. They are incompetent beyond belief and they clearly don’t want my business if they screw up majorly twice in 2 days.< /review>< time>

Would have rated higher but the person on the phone kept getting out appointment date and times on three different occasions.  Don’t you have a computer to reference for the original appointment?  We were out and about when my wife gets a call to confirm the appointment for later that day.  She had to explain it was tha wrong date.  This happened two other times.  Unbelievable!  At least the person that did the inspection was professional.</Review>

I was notified a few days ahead of the service date and received text updates when Luis was nearby. He worked quickly and efficiently and sent me another email message when the service was complete (I was not home, but my roommate was). Also another text message. That's the way it's supposed to work and always does.<//review>

The individuals who have inspected my home over the years by Terminix have always been polite and professional, have been respectful of my possessions, and have always followed up when any action was required. Any shortcomings have come from the back office.The advice offered when an infestation has been found has always been effective and prompt.The person who inspected my home this year, Paul Andrade, followed in that tradition. I am completely satisfied that I am termite free, at least for the moment.< /Text>

My cancellation was due to lack of service and lack of concern from my local Terminix office.  I was recently contacted by the national office and offered another contract.  I decided to give Terminix another chance.  I was very pleased with my most recent service.  The technician, Erik, was very professional.  He took the time to talk to me about the area I needed him to treat in my kitchen pantry and explain the type of infestation and treatment process.  I was also very happy to be contacted by email and text so that I was able to track the arrival of the technician.  I am looking forward to continued excellent service.</review><gmapID>0x80c2d259850d4a4b:0xc5f7cb077eee7da8</gmapID>< name>

<text>The person that came out to do the inspection (Nate)didn’t bother to check visually to see if the tent fumigation would be possible. He stated that he would be getting signatures from my neighbors since my garage is connected to he house behind mine and next door. The day of the fumigation I was at work and left my mom at home with intstructions that they would be coming. When the employees got here they stated that only one neighbor signed the form and they were not able to get access to the other house.
I was at work and was receiving a million phone calls from Terminix that they wanted to move forward with the fumigation but wouldn’t be able to tent my garage. Nate texted and informed me that we would have to go the route of spraying the garage in sessions. I clearly asked him if this format would be the same as tenting the garage and he confirmed. The guys that were actually tenting the house informed my mom that spraying the garage would most definitely not work the same way.
To top it off the guy that tented my home stated that I would have to leave again although they would just be covering the garage if they were to ever do it! Are you kidding me I have to pay 800+ again to stay at a hotel!
I’ve been calling the office in Santa Fe springs and haven’t been able to get through, an operator answers after hours and she’s been saying that she left a message so someone can get back to me since Nate doesn’t answer my calls either and nothing!
This company is not reputable! I never provide feedback but they are a true scamming company all they care for is getting your signature to bill you!

Will most definitely inform all possible people to never do business with this company!!

RIDICULOUS!!! they replied to my posting saying to contact them, I emailed them Monday and called Tuesday now it’s Thursday evening and I haven’t heard from anybody!

I was guaranteed a call within 24-48 hours.
I want nothing to do with this company my contract will most definitely be canceled!<//text>< Pics>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Review>Sorry I can't give you the names of all the associates I have encountered in my years with the company, but I can't remember a time or experience that I was not treated courteously. I have been particularly impressed by the service of the last two inspectors that have come to my home. I'm sorry I don't have the name of last year's gentleman, but this year it was David Montoya. I appreciated both of their honesty in suggesting improvements that could be made to the house to further protect it from termites. As a side note last week my neighbor was scheduled for an inspection and I even met and had an opportunity to chat with L'Roderick on that occasion. It is not to often that a company's name on the side of the car would encourage me to greet the associate.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>You wrote a review for Terminix	3 weeks ago
1.0 star rating 7/2/2018
Another terrible review! Why bother taking time writing? So no one else will use this company.

First, my previous company was bought out by Terminix. This spring on our annual inspection, the inspector, who is really an inexperienced salesman in sheep's clothing, found rat droppings, fresh, in the attic. Not surprising. So I accepted their exclusion service, which was fine. But then they put traps in the attic to remove any rats. They did not check the traps for a month, until I called and asked them to. Surprise, no rats! Great. But I know that they did not remove the traps, and they did not ever come back to check them. So I probably have dead, decaying rats in my attic.

Second, the salesman said they could get rid of my gophers but I needed to add the whole house coverage with an initial cost of $500 plus $100 each quarter. He said that they would not use poison, since we have dogs. However, the technician doing the job said they always use poison. The long and short is, 6 months later, we still are overrun with gophers. And, they know that they are not fixing the problem so they don't bother coming any more.

Repeated calls to the company supervisor are unanswered. When I call in (by the way, the phone service and operators are VERY NICE and cooperative!!), I am promised a call back within two days. The billing office said that they could waive the $100 quarterly payment but that the supervisor should review the case and do that. Obviously, the supervisor is ineffective, probably overwhelmed with complains, and not able to effect any change.

I am now at the regional manager level with a promise from the (nice) phone representative, of a call back.  When? Who knows but I will be asking for my $500 back!

It continues to get worse. The regional manager must have called the local manager in Santa Fe Springs who did call me back. He PROMISED refund of $500 and immediate service. I RECEIVED NEITHER. Further, the accounting department now calls constantly asking for not only the March $100, but an additional $100 for July service that I never received, AS PROMISED BY THE LOCAL MANAGER.

You cannot call the local office! Their number rolls over to the Corporate office somewhere else in these United States.< /Review>< pictures>

Former customer. Go somewhere else ! Company policy says its ok to go out to your residence without notification and do alleged "outside" work when you are not home. Wether the work was done or not is still in question.Talked to several customer service people, did not get call backs as promised, had to chase after them to get more information. Company cares more about ripping you off than doing the right thing. If you do decide to try them, do not do the automatic payment from your account. They feel its ok to take the money out of your account  whenever they deem it necessary. Horrible experience !!!</review>

When we called for a quote, the gentleman who inspected was informative about our damage, the process we were facing and attentive to the fact I have a daycare business in my home to work around. The workers showed up earlier in the afternoon than they stated so we were able to begin a bit sooner than anticipated. They were respectful of my home and contents. They called before returning so we could meet them at the house for detenting.< /review>

After 1 week of treatment I have only 1 new mound rather than the 5-7 I would find every day.  Here's hoping to some more succesful treatments. Paul the service technician was great.

<Review>At approximately 10 minutes before my two hour waiting window , I received a voice message from a staff member impersonating himself as a supervisor, who stated that he was out of town and needed to reschedule the appointment for another date. When I followed up with the actual office I was told that he was a service tech not a sup. Not only was this unprofessional and a total disregard for my time that I took to accommodate this request, but totally dishonorable as a representative of this organization. If a person on staff can act in such bad faith, how can he or this company be trusted on anything that they claim in their reports and or services tendered? Shady business!!!<//Review><date>1464538226279</date>< user_id>

<Review>Technician was running late due to your required meeting. He called as soon as he could to let us know & see if his  new ETA  would be acceptable or if we needed him to reschedule. He is extremely polite and always checks to see if we are experiencing any problems. He also reminds us he can come between scheduled visits should any problems arise.< /Review>< pics>

Office and Service staff are always respectful and professional. When the Terminix Service personnel arrive to perform the requested service he always announces he is present on the property and asks if there are any problems that might have come up since his last visit and to explain what service he will be providing.</Review>

The reviews are true. This company is ran my COMPLETE dumb asses. COMPLETE DUMB ASSES! First, they don’t ask you what day/time you would like. They randomly pick a day and more than likely it doesn’t work for you. Somehow, the phone appointments are completely different from what the technicians have. What kind of dumb f*ckery is that?! I have had nothing but issues with these idiots, but they charge your card quickly and on time. Somehow, they can’t make the service work the same way. They obviously don’t care because numerous people complain and they still continue the same stupid ass practice, which is not in the best interest of the customer. I recommend using Orkin or even DIY stuff from Home Depot. This company is a big joke.< /text>

Terminix provides an invaluable service necessary for desert living. Termininx is statffed by true professionals. They show up on time, are pleasant and polite, and immediately set about the task of spraying to keep our home free of desert bugs. Our Terminix professional answers all our questions, and leaves us with the confidence that our home is protected for the next quarter.<//Text>

Excellent customer service was received by Eduardo (Terminix Tech).  He personally called me prior to his visit to confirmation the work that will be performed. Also, Eduardo asked if there are any areas inside the house or  around the house that more attention, which he would focus on.< /Review>

We felt marginalized by the previous service provided as it was not effective in removing our pest problem. One individual made a difference in restoring our confidence that we made the right choice in pest control services available in our area. Neal Marsh made the right decision to provide us with the highest personal and professional service as well as ensuring our needs were met by coordinating with other members of his team to mitigate our immediate issues. We were very impressed by his actions and the courteous response we received with Alfredo for exclusion inspection and Christian for follow-up pest removal. This is the type of service I had originally envisioned I would be receiving but had grown disillusioned and eventually would have to start shopping again. I hope this continues to be the example set by your company and look forward to this continued service. Shaun Long Beach, CA</review>

<text>My most recent experience with my Terminex Technician, Mark, was very pleasurable, as always.  Mark is always on time, he gives you a summary of what he is going to do, why he is doing it and he always makes sure to ask about any issues that may have occured since his last visit.  Mark is always professional, very presentable, and sociable.  I am very fortunate to have Mark as my Service Technician</text>< Resp>

It's made a big difference-less or no ants, crickets, silverfish and glad to know they use non poisonous natural subtract that doesn't kill higher ups in the food chain. I've seen more hawks in La Mirada!</Review>

<username>John W< /username><time>1614658428807< /time><Review>I had Terminix service my home for a roach issue, when I signed up for the service I was promised that if I agreed to pay another 100 dollars that the roaches would be gone on the first treatment. The first treatment came and the roaches were still here after a week I was told I would get the 100 dollars back if the roach treatment failed which it did. I have made 2 more appointments to have them come out and treat for the roaches and they have stood me up both times. I was told 10 times that the branch manager Todd Rushworth would return my calls. To this day I have never got a call from anyone in Terminix. I was told by corporate that would cancel my service and zero my account and we would part our ways. Well you guessed it no calls and I just got a notice of collection from there collection company. So now I am filling out the small claims court papers to take them to court. This could of all be avoided had Todd Rushworth returned one of my 10 calls. If you are smart you would avoid this company like the plague. Very dishonest and only cares about the money . Todd Rushworth is not a very good branch manager of the Santa Fe Springs office. I just talk to corporate and am waiting a call from them again. I will update this post when I hear from them.

I stand by my quote but the owner called me and took care of all the issues and concerns I had. I would use this place again now that I am better educated about the process.< /Review><rate>5</rate>< Pictures>

Wow... I was impressed with the technology Terminix uses. Had an inspector come out, I signed up for service on the spot through a smart device, got an email instantly with an appointment. Now I'm sitting here 1 hour past my appointment and NO SHOW and NO CALL. It's like not showing up to an interview. Called Terminix and they said my appointment was scheduled but not assigned to a technician. How does this happen? Such a let down. #UnhappyCustomer<//Text>

Not sure how they get good reviews. Check yelp. I had this team that destroyed plants on 5 bays and left one bay only OK where they protected the plants. I showed them how to wrap the tent around the patio posts and seal it next to curb and they followed instructions on one bay only letting the tent on other 5 bays cover plants and kill them 3-5 feet wide. they also broke few sprinkler lines. I will try to figure how to upload the pictures so you can see with your own eyes. They broke one huge plant pot and one worker told me: " With your money this is nothing" Horrible experience. Run, do not let your property in their hands. About $3-4000 worth of damage</Text>

Prompt, clean and very professional when our house was tented for termites. The only reason I'm givin a four star rating, is that their external treatment for pests like spiders and ants was lacking. It's supposed to control bugs for three months, but after only a month we had spider webs all over the outside of our home. I would expect better extermination of bugs for the price I paid. Could probably do the same with a gallon of spectricide and only pay $12.00.</Text>

We're not huge fans of environmental pesticides.  But we also have a woodsy backyard and spiders, mosquitos and other bugs have made their way into our house alot in the past.  This doesn't happen now.  And the care and consideration of the service reps are good - we particularly appreciate our guy who comes, Frankie.<//text>

My experience with Terminix lays mostly within the communication lines open to consumers within their company.  Customer service is instructed to not give out names and numbers of supervisors or anyone that can actually HELP you. Instead, they rely on technicians, some very skilled -- others not.  They try to sell you services that you don't need at a very high price. If I were a good technician, I'd stay away from this company's practices of making sales people out of all of you. As for the consumer.  CAVEAT EMPTOR!</Text>

Completely checked all areas as usual, sprayed for pests inside and out, but 4 days later, we were invaded with ants and black widows everywhere. We called for a respray and it improved the problem about 70%.This has happened before, maybe a strong spray should be used, the first time. The technician is always very polite and leaves everything very clean. He usually arrives close to time period or calls if going to be early or late, which is appreciated. Customer service is very cooperative about setting up a reinspection or spraying. Have been with Terminex for many years. Have coverage for all areas of service for our property.<//review>

I paid for a higher level of insulation to an R50 but they installed lesser level after we asked an independent company to check it out and took pics that it was between an R32-R38.  I have been contacting them for over two weeks, David my sales rep by text. Left msg, contacted customer service 3x to escalate to higher level - and nobody gives you a courtesy call back and they are dodging calls.  VERY BAD BUSINESS - this is fraud!  I suggest any of you who has had insulation installed dont take their word for it since you usually dont go up there.  Today I was told it was escalated to the Regional Level - waiting for response.  If they are HONEST - they should have contacted me the first time to talk about issue and rectify situation instead of this total blackout.< /text>

I gave them 1 star only because 0 was not an option. Scheduled an appt. over the weekend for Monday. Here we are on Wednesday and no technician has appeared. Have called numerous times and not 1 call back. They did however process my monthly service fee. So dissapointing.< /Review>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>I discovered termites swarming outside my house. Being a single senior citizen, I did not know what to do. I called the pest control company that was servicing inside my house and was told that there was water under my house and nothing could be done until that dried up!? No offer of how to get rid of water! Two different neighbors said "call Terminex", which I did. John Hayhurst, inspector came out and pumped the water out from under my house, did everything necessary to inspect and treat my house! He was the first person that showed that he wanted to help me, instead of looking for a reason not to. Terminex may be a little more expensive,? But you sure get what you pay for!< /Text>< name>

This review is for Terminix commercial  in general.
seriously... they suck.
Tech turn around rate is high. Service is terrible. They do not show up on day and time of "scheduled appts".  They do not return calls. They respond to extra service request 3 weeks after initial request.  They will give you all kinds of reasons why YOU didn't request things in the right way. Sometimes you luck out and get a great tech... one that returns your calls and shows up in a reasonable amount of time after a request. I havent had one of those in probably 3 years. My current tech is friendly and polite in person. fabulous. This does not help me if i cannot get  serviced when requested. This is a business. They obviously do not value everyones business. have been a customer , this time around since 2013. Clearly, ive been beyond patient. Looks like its time for a new company... again.
* for those who wonder whyI stayed so long with a company that treats its customers so nonchalantly: laziness and convenience. I didnt want to start the whole figuring it out process with someone else. but they have exceeded even my low bar and threshold for lazin</Text>

<Review>Negative 10-- I never do anything like this but to anyone in the SoCal, please do NOT use Terminix. Alix and I noticed a few termites and called based on a recommendation. What has happened--- has been the worst customer service EVER! First the inspector at Terminix scheduled our house to be for June 6th. Terminix came and laid bait traps collected money from us. We called to get some questions answered and were informed that our tenting was for July 6th not June 6th. Which was no biggie. We asked for a call from the branch manager at Terminix and we never got one. On June 6th-- the gas company turned off our Gas because of a request from Terminix. The house wasn't tented but the gas was off. When the gas company came back to turn on the gas they broke our stove. We called Terminix 4 more times asking for a branch manager. NOTHING. Finally--we cancelled. Guess what --we got a call from the Terminix branch manager asking us about the tenting on July 6th. This is two days after we cancelled. He said he wasn't informed then he never returned our calls. Today our gas was shut off again because Terminix never informed the gas company that we cancelled so here we go again. Terminix when you are asking people for a lot of money. Give them common or basic customer service. Terminix is the worst and never use them.<//Review>< GmapID>

Their Branch manager Andrew doesnt know how to return phone calls. 5 hours waiting for his  call and nothing. Thats the BRANCH MANAGER for you guys.  Their fumigation crew can't follow directions nor keep track of time.  They donar give you courtesy phone call to ask if you can come in early than expected, they just show up ame expect you get out of their way.. .
Their dispatch ladies cant help out either, they promise to have mánagers and or crew members  call you back with in minutes and that never happens. Called back hours later than they say that there is a 24 hr call back waiting time.... 24 hrs? What is that going to solve? There is no sense of urgency here. If was able to not highlight a star í wouldn't...< /text>

<Review>Near the Santa Fe Springs Terminix branch, I was stopped at light watching what appeared to be a stalled Terminix vehicle that was 2-3 car lengths behind the vehicle in front of it.  The driver was smoking a cigarette in the car.  I easily maneuvered my car in front of him so I wouldn't miss the light.  When the light turned green, the Terminix employee sped past me swerving violently while sticking his middle finger out the window, before pulling into his workplace parking lot.  Given his irrational and aggressive behavior, I'd think twice before contracting the services of a Terminix employee.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2d259850d4a4b:0xc5f7cb077eee7da8< /GmapID>< rate>
