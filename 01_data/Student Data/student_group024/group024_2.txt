<text>WOLA is by far the best workout studio in Los Angeles. It is a fun and lively community with the best owners, instructors, and concierges. Everyone walks out of class with a smile and an overall feeling of success. The classes are tough, but very manageable. There is enough varied levels of equipment that each person can perform the workout based on their own skill level. Not to mention, WOLA has tween classes!!! Want to workout after work, but have to pick up your kid from school? Bring them! There’s a class for them to take too and it’s just as fun. Plus, having a well-trained instructor pushing you to your limits is very encouraging and makes everyone want to work out more and WOLA knocks this aspect out of the park. The WOLA family is truly one of a kind and Craig and Leonard are the best. Forever will love WOLA :)</text>< Rate>

<Text>As a long time fitness trainer, writer and enthusiast, I can hands down say WOLA has HIIT going on. No pun. The workout is intense, short enough to not lose my mind, and works every single muscle group. The studio is immaculate. The people are next level cool. From the owners who make you truly feel like family, to the peeps who workout here. Everyone is loving, warm, open and welcoming. It's become a real community. And not only because you can bring your kids to workout next door! Which is beyond incredible, but having so much to do with the vibe you get the minute you  walk through the door.  Once you start, you can't stop. I've also gotten in crazy shape over the past year, from this training. Five stars all the way around!< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1572312032336, 'text': 'Thanks for the great feedback.

<Review>Good vibes all around! When I arrived, I was greeted by Craig, who warmly gave me a quick tour around the studio. The space itself is bright and clean, with a modern flair. There's a warm-up area up front, and then a darker room where the circuit-training happens. In the back, there are lockers and bathrooms. We took a 45-minute FIT class with Tiffany on a Tuesday morning. The class consisted of a warm-up followed by 3 stations with 3 activities each that we looped through 3 times each. After circuit-training, we concluded with an ab workout on the mats, which was quite strenuous too (I had been expecting to just end with stretches). I also really appreciated how well-ventilated the room was - when we were wrapping up, there was extra air cooling the room, which made it very refreshing. Overall, the workout was well-organized and sufficiently challenging! Tiffany was upbeat, engaging, and full of positive energy - we  really enjoyed our WOLA experience!</Review>< pictures>

I've been taking classes at WOLA for a little over a year. I can honestly say, I've never stuck with a workout routine this long. The atmosphere is fun and welcoming. I feel included in a community of people who are focused on making fitness a priority. The staff is knowledgeable and encouraging. I trust the instructors, and know they will be there when my form needs a little correction or to push me to go the extra mile. The schedule is consistent with classes available in the mornings and evenings. Thanks to WOLA, I look forward to my workouts now.<//Review>

<Review>Highly recommended! Unique approach to a challenging and comprehensive workout. I really enjoyed the combination of weights, body weight and props (slam ball, etc), with trainers who know just how much to push you, while always focusing on technique and safety.

WOLA is not only an amazing but outstanding work out studio that provides a warm and friendly environment to everyone who walks through her doors. All of the staff members are kind and helpful and really try their hardest to help you reach your fitness goals. The classes are high intensity and filled with adrenaline. They are truly perfect for getting your blood flowing and by the time the class is over you will most definitely feel your greatest. I highly recommend WOLA it is the best workout and studio in the city by far!!</Review>

Music is always on point - mostly 90 R&B. The staff and  owners are super personable and helpful. The trainers are hands-on if you want help and hands-off if you don't. Killer workout without being intimidating. A++++++< /review>< Pictures>

I consider myself a very active person but I have never been someone to go to a gym and especially to take a "class" at a gym.  I decided I needed to do SOMETHING different and my love of the people who started WOLA drew me to try it.   I can honestly say it's the best choice I've made for myself in years.  I'm not only more fit, but the endorphins I get from being in the class are priceless.  The classes are fun, the right amount of challenging, and it's quick - 45 minutes and you feel good about yourself the rest of the day.   You don't have to be in great shape to participate - the exercises are adaptable for all levels of fitness - and everyone is friendly and busy doing their own thing.    Just try it.   I love it.<//Text>

Just the right mix of hi intensity cardio with lean muscle building. The ability to sculpt and tone and burn calories in a 45 minute workout has kept me coming back. The instructors are awesome and the whole vibe of the place is super positive. They have classes for my kids too (5, 9, 11) and they LOVE coming.</Text>

BEST WORK OUT IN LA!!! Fantastic staff, great instructors and the most effective workout if you want to get in shape and lose wait.  More effective than spinning, Pilates, other circuit training classes, etc.</Text>

This place is fantastic.  I have treated my wife to a couple sessions and she loves the work out.  The specialized workout utilizes a lot of unused muscles.  You will burn a lot of calories and work on core strength at the same time.  Only bummer is that we live in the Bay Area and cannot come more often.  Open one up north WOLA!<//review>

My daughter loves the dance class where they recreate music videos from the 80’s, 90’s and today. I can also workout while she takes her class which is so great. The adult HIIT class is tough but you can work at your own pace. The instructors really give each person in the room personal instruction. And then we all love the family boxing (PHIGT) which we can take together! The instructors and staff are so positive and uplifting that I can’t wait to workout. It is a great community of people and families. It is a one of a kind and very special workout studios.<//text>

<Review>I used to always get stuck working the same muscles in the same way, scared to try new workouts for fear of being bad at anything sports-adjacent.  If you're athlete-minded, over-competitive or just prefer routine like me, WOLA is perfect because you engage so many muscles you didn't know you had while the format, community, and schedule remain constant.  You can start anywhere and the people around you will always push you to go just beyond your comfort zone so you are always improving.  I became so much more aware of my body, strengths and limitations here. Showing up to WOLA is the best part of my day!</Review><UserId.>110194570682903416437< /UserId.><pics>None<//pics><GmapID>0x80c2b93128f1ad8f:0xf4eb418e5c559e63</GmapID><Response>{'time': 1560463931918, 'text': 'Thanks for the kind words.

I rarely post a comment but this gym deserves the praise for the energy, positive attitude, and awesome workout.  We have come in on Saturdays and my kids (10 and 8 years old) worked out while I did the adult circuit.  For me the workout was perfect - great mix of strength, core and cardio.  My kids were sweaty and happy, and always want to do more.  Thanks WOLA.</review>

<text>This place rocks! I have gone to WOLA 5 times now and have tried three different instructors Craig, Simone, and Arien... and they are all awesome! I have done the SWEAT and FIT classes. Which are both structured really well and leave me feeling amazing! These classes really pack a punch...

Another big positive is the music that they play, Craig, Simone, and Arien have had such good playlists, and they are always different. This is a huge bonus in my eyes.

oh and there is a good amount of private WOLA parking around the block which is super awesome for the busy area....

The people that work there are awesome, the place is always super clean.

<Text>I started going to peace in 2009, I left to attend another church, I knew in my spirit I needed to go back to peace where the teaching isn’t watered down. This is my third Sunday coming back enjoying the pure truth of God and the Holy Scriptures. If you wanna know how to stay saved, be saved please go to peace bishop Swancy isn’t gonna water down the word of God he’s gonna tell you just the way we’re supposed to live if we wanna see and be with the Lord on that great and awesome day.< /Text>< resp>

I attended this church back in the 80's when it was located in Ingelwood and it was the very reason I strayed from God and Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. I was very young at the time and had gone through some devastating events. I was seeking comfort in the Lord and was baptized there but was told that if I did not speak in tongues that I would not be recognized by God or as a member of the church, hence when it did not happen I was shunned. Unlike some of you, I was not greeted very warmly and frankly, Pastor's message was not delivered very kind or loving and I believe in the truth and speaking directly from the Holy Bible. Of course I am older and have since been called back to the Lord, have been saved by full water immersion, enrolled in Theology and Seminary School, participate in Missionary work, and have been lead to a beautiful and loving church lead by strong and anointed leaders that work tirelessly to connect people to Jesus Christ, that teach the gospel from the Holy Bible which does not include guilt and shame. This was a young church when I first attended so I hope Pastor has grown in his methods of teaching because again I state it was because of you I was turned off from Christianity. I praise God for leading me back to Christ Jesus and creating in me a grateful and faithful follower.< /Review>

One of the best places to attend, visit or become a member if you desire. Upon my first visit i was welcomed with warm smiles and hand shakes and encouragment to return again and again. What I love most is the encouragment of freedom in the spirit which may not be received in other places. You will not leave the same way you came in.<//Text>

<review>This is the place where I really got SAVED according to the New Birth preached by Jesus, and according to Acts 2:38. This place in my opinion is the BEST CHURCH on earth. Pastor Swancy over the years have been a GREAT example of INTEGRITY and what a godly man should be; Pastor Swancy is truly ANOINTED, APPOINTED, & CALLED in these last days the proclaim the word of Salvation and Jesus' reappearing. Most folks pastoring & preaching toady have no anointing and have called themselves to the ministry, this is not the case with pastor Swancy. I would recommend this church to anyone living in Los Angeles whose looking for the real deal where the man of God lives what he preaches. You want real salvation go to Peace Apostolic Church, you will NOT be disappointed.....Happy to call this church forever home!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><time>1542643652496<//time><username>Lamar Alexander</username><Rate>5< /Rate>< GmapID>

Cornelio was so fast to reprint my receipt (8 seconds and it was already on my hand!)... immediately after, I went to my table and then he, as fast as I seat, he brought my order and my fork to my table! This is one of those rare places with tasty food and the prices are not bad at all despite it is inside of a big Mall. Excellent! 😉👌🏻<//Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJlhbs27Y46T2POUY2JyHxl_smR9sC4wAqr03Q=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pics>< response>

Cancun juice is the place for some real unique Mexican food with hint health congest items. Of course it depends on the meal. You can get some chicken taquitos alright serving is really tasting and you totally don't feel guilty :). The star is their burrito at about 6ish with tax is by far one the best breakfast burritos I've had in my life. This is not the Mexican burrito you eat and it fills you all day. The egg, bean, bacon and ham were cooked just right. It was so good! I kind of regret not adding a freshly squeezed orange juice. Their Carne Asada Torta with a side of fried banana  & strawberry with  3 leches icing is so good! The place is always clean and the manager is always attentive of the customer needs. Oh yeah, the green salsa is really good goes great with any meal from there.<//text>

<text>Food is delicious, great marinated meats to choose from. This was our first time visting and am happy that this place is affordable and delicious. These two qualities is what will bring us back. This is our new favorite place to eat at when we are at the mall. I highly recommend this place. I usually dont write reviews, yet alone write a positive one but this place deserves 10 stars.

Keep up the great work and delicious food.

Empty plates, its that good!</text><rate>5</rate>< UserId.>

< Review>
Order took too long to be ready , total about 40 minutes. Ridiculous! Ordered a green juice , they gave me a small instead of large and the lady was too lazy to prepare more so she decided to just fill the rest up with pure orange juice. My mom is diabetic and the last thing she needs is all that sugar. No utensils in the bag.<//Review>

Eric S. has been our Technician for years.  He does an exceptional job!!!  We worked with Eric so he would use a spray that is toxic to the pests, but is non-toxic to our dog, us and the environment!  It even smells kind of nice.. wintergreen.  Eric is always professional and knowledgeable and SUPER friendly!  Our property backs up to a creek and a wildlife preserve, so there are A LOT of insects!  Eric sprays the perimeter of the house and it works!  It is okay as long as the "bugs" stay outside!!!  Thanks Eric!</Text>

Rob is always very thorough; I especially appreciate the time he takes to explain what needs to be done.

There has been no noticeable rodent damage since he started work here :-).< /Text>

< Review>
Tenants had just moved out of my rental, giving me the opportunity to consider selling. To help make the re-rent or sell decision, I needed estimates for any repair work that would help sell the house. I began by calling Advanced IPM for a pest inspection.

The inspector checked for dry rot by poking a metal-tipped pole into suspicious areas of siding, eaves, window sills, etc. The metal tip left a hole the size of a pencil eraser, just enough to be noticeable, but small enough not to require repair in the event of re-renting.

Later in the day, I received a call from Advanced IPM informing me that the inspector had been “let go,” and “Another inspector will be out tomorrow.”

The new inspector, “J,” marked areas of dry rot much differently: when he found indications of rot, he poked his pole into the wood, then gave it a sudden twist, popping out a chunk. The divots he created were large and unsightly enough that, should I decide to re-rent, I’d have to repair the damage. I wasn’t happy. He also missed dry rot in the rear eave that the “let go” inspector had noted.
I decided to sell. After all repairs were completed, I called Advanced IPM for a re-inspection. While J checked the repairs, I asked why he popped out chunks of wood. His reply: “So if we get the job, my crew can identify the dry rot,” a ridiculous answer, since his own pest report showed the exact locations of dry rot. J said he’d send a clearance report the next day. A week later --- no clearance. I called and asked a staff member to send it.

When the property sold, the buyer asked for a Home Inspection. The inspector found a three-foot-long area of dry rot in plain sight next to the chimney and another above the garage door. Fortunately, California has a Structural Pest Control Board which takes consumer complaints seriously, and Advanced IPM repaired and painted the missed areas at no cost.
J unnecessarily damaged my property, gave an unbelievable reason for doing so, missed three areas of dry rot, and didn’t send a clearance as promised.

I won’t be calling Advanced IPM again.</Review>

Sunday morning, Nov 6, 2016, at around 9:15am on Foothills Blvd.  A guy in a white pickup was driving so irresponsible he was a danger to everyone on the road.  Tailgating at 10ft behind cars going 45mph, darting in and out of traffic, a total disregard for safety.  When He got next to me I see ADVANCED PEST CONTROL all over the truck.  I'm a small business owner and if I knew an employee was representing my business like that he would never drive for me again.

If you use Advanced for your pest control, I hope they get to your house without killing someone on the way there!  I won't have to worry about it because I won't be using them.< /text>

<review>Once they start treating your house, they won't stop and will keep billing you no matter how many times you tell them to stop.  I have asked them to cancel their service 2 times but they keep sending me new bills and charging my credit card.  They say they have done treatments but no one was at the house when they said they went.< /review>< Rating>

<Text>The technician who came out to my home was very friendly however the website says they are open 24 hours but they close at 5pm... Don't believe when they say someone will come out after hours because they won't. And the rep who is responsible for chatting...  Kept saying yes to my question of having after hours peraons but then stated she can get my name and contact info and have them call when back in the office. I asked when they would be back.... She tells me hours are from 7am-5pm.......... Change your hours please and do not tell customers that someone will come out once I find a rodent on the trap. It would have been very helpful to know given i had to take off work for the first appointment and my office hours are the same.... The tech also told me he was going to return to my home today to check the traps... It is 734pm and I have yet to get a call, appt, anything for him to come check the traps. Very disappointed and I will be reportimg it to my complex as well so they understand the company they are using doesn't properly follow up. I usually would not Go through all of this amd would just stop dealimg with the company... Which I am.. But I am highly upset that I have a dead rat under my sink and I have to wait for removal. That is disgusting and not what was originally told.</Text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

<time>1392841939508<//time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Adam is our superhero pest controller!  He is extremely knowledgeable, professional, courteous, and friendly. When I have questions about different types of bugs that I am concerned about, he educates me about them. He shows me pictures to help ID the bugs I am describing. I've even captured indoor bugs and put them into zip lock bags and he identifies them and lets me know what I need to do to scout for them and prevent them from returning. He hangs moth traps inside for me too. He cautiously sprays our property well, cleans the areas needed for cobwebs, etc.  I truly feel safe and confident in Adam and IPM, and I hope that I NEVER loose Adam as my bug guy.  He's the best!  Thank you IPM! : )<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x809b206e8aef8c6b:0x173045d156c80372<//gmap_id></record>

<Review>After 7 months of not having a haircut, I made an appointment at D&R Barbershop.  First impressions, clean, professional, welcoming establishment.  My hair had grown into a form of it's own I let Jeremy "take the wheel".  (I just didn't want to end up bald).  The man delivered and I'm happy to report that my dog recognizes me again.  Definitely going back.<//Review>< date>

Seven barbers were working and not one bad haircut left the shop. These guys and girls are professionals. Best haircut I've gotten in the Oakland area. Will definitely be back every two weeks. Darnell did a great job. Highly recommend this spot.</Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

The only place that got me the right haircut. My wife loves my new hairdo! Jeremy was awesome! Took his time fading my hair and advising the right thing to do. I would definitely come back here and be a regular. The Barbers were also very professional and respectful to their clients. Glad I found this Barber Shop!<//Review>

<rating>5<//rating><resp>None</resp><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>I recommend this place without hesitation.

I tried several places over the past few years (barbers and salons) but never quite pleased.... mainly the lack of good, positive customer interaction.  If I'm paying for service, I expect to be treated as an appreciated patron.

This barbershop exceeded my  customer service expectations, and the hair cut was exactly as "the doctor ordered".... the first time!

Ray was "The Man".... and i'll be back to see him again.

Thanks much, gents!<//Text></record></dataset><record>

Reached 5 mins before appointment time and waited 40 mins for the barber to free up. Didnt get the hair cut.
Very Disappointed. Total waste of time. The place did look cool though, pity they give a damn about customer time. They acting like they don't need any new customers.< /text>

<review>After months searching for a decent place locally that can do beards and hair, finally found one! D+R does a fantastic job, taking the time to really make you look and feel your best. If setting an appointment, ask for Ray or Jeremy for an awesome cut.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Union City isn't my usual stomping ground but I was in the area with a few hours to kill and an unruly mop of hair on my head. D&R popped up on my search and I decided to take a chance. Boy am I glad I did. I didn't have an appointment so I had to wait about 30 minutes but the haircut and friendly service was well worth the wait. I ended up with Jeremy (second chair from the door on the right) and he did a fantastic job.  I might have to accidentally end up in Union City again in about 6-8 week. Tips: make an appointment and bring cash.</review>

Darn  (I meant another word)  this was just like going into the movie.   As a white guy who grew up in Oak-Town back in the 70's these guys just kick it old style.   Best darn hair cut that I have had in 15-25 years.   Gordon was my guy but I am sure the other gentlemen will do just the same quality job.

Sheeesh when I lived in Palo Alto, they would charge me 3 times the price for 1/4 of the time.

This is a real barber shop.

Five Stars.....

This place is my favorite site.  Of all restaurants I know I love it most. I never miss an opportunity to go to that place. when  I want to go to a decent supper, this restaurant comes first to my head. fresh and diverse  food and a rich cuisine.generous crew, and great mood. And very important, the price is modest. I sent my friends to this restaurant with no doubt.<//text>

<response>None</response><text>We went to this place because of its Google ratings. When we got in front of the restaurant, we were very hesitant to even walk in given the dirty windows of the place, thinking if it looks dirty from the outside, then it must be dirty from the inside. Well, we walked in and the tables were clean, which is what matters mostly. The server was extremely nice with an amazing customer service. The food was also amazing and I would just say it was toooo much food. They're not cheap and they give plenty of everything. The coke was terrible as it tasted like bad water. I guess my rating is based only on the customer service and the taste of the food. Even if the food was made in an unsanitary place, the fact of the matter is that it tasted great.< /text>< user>

<Text>Stopped in after finding this on google maps while driving down the 5. It was one of the only open restaruants to dine in.  Needed a break and this was perfect. After 2 months of take out it was nice to sit down and enjoy a draft beer and cool a/c.  Everything was clean and service was friendly and fast. Laura brought our food out quickly and it was hot and spicy!  We had a taco salad with chicken and carne asada & shrimp fajitas. It was all good!  Thank you!< /Text>< gmapID>

When I was a little girl I used to frequent this place with my parents (like once a week!) and when the menudo was in season my dad always ordered it and the owner always brought it in his copper colored van. Now, there's been a change of ownership but the food is still good and the service is too! I really can't get over the rice and beans, like I live close and I'm glad I have will power to not go there daily . Definitely would make it one of the only spots I'd go to in the area as it's not only delicious but holds a special place in my heart. Plenty of parking as well. Go on now, enjoy some good Mexican fare!<//review>

I love this place. I come here all of the time with my mom. I always get the cheese enchiladas. Today I had a grilled chicken sandwich and it came with fries, salad and a drink for only $5.95! They have the best horchata and homemade ranch dressing.< /Text>

Laura's provides genuine Mexican dishes at a good price. The food was very good, but fell just short of taking my number one spot. The service too was very good, and the restaurant was clean, but could use better lighting.</Review>

Love it. The food has great flavor. Great people. It's too bad the parking is a hassle and very small restaurant. Not sure how long it's been open, but it needs more space and more decor. But food wise I'll give it a 5. For a date night um no no not good.<//text>

<Text>The worst food. The worst service. It made me vomit for a week. To top it off the tacos were 4$ and I don't even get a drink with it. The worst tortilla i have ever had. I am 13 and I can make better tacos than them. If you like wasting your money on bad food and service come here. If you want to pay 16$ for 2 tacos and a torta come here.</Text>< Pics>

I go there for the Pozole which they make with purple hominy and pork without bone. They have a decent selection of sea food which I haven’t tried, but they have positive food reviews from newspapers posted around the restaurant so it should be decent.</review>

<Text>Love this place, I've been going here for years and the family that operates this establishment is nice and attentive. My go to is the Costa Brava soup which I highly recommend if you're looking for a great seafood soup. My wife loves the chile relleno burrito.< /Text><UserId.>110234673793710978208<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80c290d8101cbb79:0x20cac7c6c6ba7951</GmapID></record>

I got the Crab Enchiladas, with a Chile Relleno on the side. The crab tasted like it had been from a can or frozen. It was rough and hair-like. The sauce on the enchilada was overwhelmingly liquidy. The chile relleno was not made with a pasilla chile pepper, like I had been hoping. Instead, it was made with an Anaheim chile pepper. There was very little cheese inside and a lot of batter on the outside.

The salad with ranch dressing was good and the chips and salsa were also good. If I ever go back, I will try a taco or burrito since the dishes I ordered must be harder to get right.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

I went for the first time last Sunday while visiting my bestie who lives literally down the street from here. I had been craving taquitos and I was not disappointed. They were so good I literally cleaned the plate! Not a speck of rice or beans left either. I wanted the sopa de Albondigas to take home for my Mom but they ran out...I know why since my taquitos came with either soup or salad. Our waiter - the owner's son - suggested the Caldo de Rez instead! Mom and I split it for dinner; she loved it! Next time I'm getting 2 orders - one for Mom and one for me, plus an order of taquitos! Muy delicioso! I can't wait to go back because there's NOTHING like this in Glendale plus Vallarta Market in the same plaza, 2 birds with one stone! Muchas gracias for making this little Filipina who grew up in Echo Park very Happy! See you soon!!!<//Text>< pictures>

It wasn't all that good like it used to be we have been going there for many year's but just the other day for the first time in a long time the food was not all that and the price was to expensive to the one thing I  would always get is the salad the was really good but it wasn't the same the cheese was different and the salad dressing wasn't the same😣</review>

Really good tasting Mexican-style food dishes.  They have a some of their own recipes that are super-delicious.
If you want beef, try their "shredded beef",
If chicken is your choice, their "grilled chicken" dishes are best.  2 of my favorites.
Seafood is always a bit more expensive, but try their Campachana Appetizer Platter  to share with a group.  (It has Campachana seafood ingredients, but cooked as their own special recipe.  My personal favorite of this dish is all the seafood ingredients, each sautéed to perfection using garlic-infused oil. & delicious!  My brother , from Portland, Oregon enjoys quality restaurant food. I ordered this & tried it on him.  He commented to the waiter that it was the best tasting restaurant food dish that he'd had in at least 10 years.  They do this dish to perfection!

One caveat on this dish: if the season ocean waters are warm, then the restaurant can only legally purchase oysters that have been pasturized (partially pre-cooked).  If the oysters are pasturized, it spoils their taste -really bad! (don't get the oysters if they've been pasturized: ONLY in THAT season, have them leave out the oysters and substitute more of one of the other ingredients).
If it's been cooler and the small oysters are NOT pasturized, DO get them - broiled on the half-shell with garlic oil (Yum!)

Many of their delicious sauces are made in-house.  Their pico-de-gallo is a treat, assembled with fresh ingredients when you order it.  Order this when they first seat you & they'll bring it out to enjoy with their house-fried table chips.  Nothing mushy or blah about this Pico-de-gallo; it is deliciously fresh at Laura's.
I love this treasured little hole-in-the-wall place.  It's been around & popular for years - and for good reason: delicious food !  AND at a good price!<//text>

<text>Worst place ever! First of all customer service sucks.
Nasty food & they still have the audacity to charge for a plate of food that not even a dog would eat.
Don't waste ur money in this place!</text></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
This is a little mom and pop restaurant. I've been here a few times when I want to get something quick and authentic. The shredded beef tostadas are to die for. They are a huge serving so if you are hungry get one. My son has had their cheese burger with fries and let me just tell you that this burger is really tasty. I've also had the 2 item combo with a chile relleno, beef enchilada and Mexican rice and refried beans also a very good dish oh and it come with a soup or salad I picked the Albondiga(meat ball) soup. The albondiga soup is very delicious and packed with vegies. My friend had the carne asada quesadilla and it was HUGE! comes with rice guacamole and sour cream. If you are in the neighborhood and want a quick Mexican bite come to Laura's.</Review>

<text>I called to ask about paver installation and spoke with Ashley. She was great! Very friendly and helpful. My  backyard is small, so she said she’d check to see if it met the company’s  minimum size requirements and would get back to me. She followed up within the hour and, unfortunately, my yard is too small but I totally understand they need to have a minimum. However, she gave me a couple other ideas, which I really appreciate. She took the time to help, which is much more than I can say for other contractors I’ve contacted-  I’m still waiting for those guys to call me back, after nearly a week! If I had a bigger backyard I would definitely have Treeium come and give me a bid. Ashley gets 5 stars!< /text>< pictures>

We have completed our first bathroom remodel with Treeium and are now moving on to the Master Bath. Sam our project manager has been very professional and an expert when it comes to creative ideas to utilize the space we have effectively. He made an outdated ‘80s era bath beautiful and modern. His crew was respectful and hardworking. During COVID times all precautions were followed! Thank you Treeium I would recommend to anyone!!!< /text>

<Name>Jennifer Clark</Name><user>115862167495711609856</user><review>Based on great reviews and presentations I hired Treeium to renovate a garage into an accessible suite.  This was to be completed in 6 months.  The first part of my project was for Treeium to draw up plans and get them approved by the city.  This step alone took over a year to accomplish.   After approval I was told that the construction part would be completed in 3 months and I could then move in.
The construction then started and it was terrible.  The construction team was over
scheduled.  Most days only one person showed up to work and there were days and weeks no one came at all.  Many mistakes were made needing to be corrected.   Trash was piled everywhere.  This dragged out over a year.  Then after many, many complaints they finally fired the project manager and construction team and turned my project over to their quality control person.  He and his team began completing and fixing things.  When he was down to the last two things, he unfortunately quit and left the company.  My project has since been assigned to three different managers where I have had to continually explain my project status and what still needs done.  They each have promised to fix my last item, an incorrectly installed floor, but have not done so.  I am so frustrated.  My 6 month project is not finished at 3 years and my current manager is not returning my calls.  No one should have to go through this.<//review><Rate>1< /Rate></record>

We noticed a few weeks after completion of our ADU project that the grouting and front door needed attention.  The shower grout had shrunk and needed more to fill in the gaps. The front door needed another coat of paint. We also had leftover construction supplies we had no need for. I emailed the office and Lisa Brazil called me within 24 hours. We scheduled a time for the touch ups and they were completed in a timely manner. Very pleased with the customer service from Lisa and Israel, even after the project was completed.

Thank you for such a great experience.< /Text>

Dorel Zander came out to meet us for the initial estimate and stayed with us throughout the entire project. Very professional and accommodating. Answered all our questions and kept us up to date on everything.  Lior Lazarovich also was very helpful.  We were out of town for most of the project and Dorel and Lior went above and beyond to make certain we knew what was going on at all times.  The project stayed on track as the worker's came when promised, and completed work when promised. They did a great job with giving us ideas and were very helpful to make sure we got what we wanted as well.  Couldn't ask for nicer people to work with.  This was the first experience we had working with Treeium, but it will not be the last.  Our neighbors have asked about the company and we have highly recommended them.  Treeium turned out to be the best company we could have found based on price, workmanship and the employees.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
Our home was in desperate need of a remodel, it needed everything, new roof, flooring, re wire,  re plumb, four bathrooms, game room and a kitchen. Basically our home was a gut job.  I had been dreaming of a remodel for years. Needless to say we were nervous about hiring a company that could handle such a big project. After talking to numerous contractors I was becoming discouraged, no real quotes and no time lines.  Then I discovered Treeium and knew I had found a company that I could trust with a 1/2 million Dollar renovation.
Shahar Algazy has been nothing short of amazing, treating our home like his own and diligently keeping everything on time and on budget, if not Below.  Everyday since we began Shahar has had a 10 man crew on the job, practically unheard  of with most companies. When it came time to upgrade the electric panel we were faced with the possible need to destroy a large portion of  our yard and cut down a  beautiful and stately tree that is a major feature in our yard. Shahar could have left it at that but he went the extra  mile to find a better solution. Shahar saved us 30K and our beloved ficus tree.
We continue to be impressed with Treeium's customer service and communication. The Treeium portal is very easy to navigate and keeps everything clear and organized. We love the gallery that lets our friends and family keep track of the  progress. Great work Treeium and Shahar Algazy for talking such good care of our home and helping us make our remodel dreams come true.
Sincerely, Kristen Shadburn</Review>

I hired Treeium for a kitchen remodeling. My project managers were Avi Shushan and Lior Lazarovich, and I really enjoyed working with them. They were organized, straight forward and easy to work with.

My kitchen took a month to remodel but it went by quickly and they were able to accommodate my family's needs by relocating appliances that I needed to use, like the fridge and etc.

The crew was respectful, polite and very professional, all of the work - flooring, countertop, electrical, was done in time and with no issues. Everything is up to code and is of high quality standard.

There were never any delays with the project and the communication was great, I always knew what the schedule was and it made me feel like I was part of the project and not just a client. The process was very collaborative with Avi and Lior.

I really love how my kitchen ended up, I'm really happy that I found Treeium, Avi & Lior -- we now have a great new kitchen that is exactly how we wanted it.<//text>

<review>Treeium was the winning bidder in a major kitchen remodel. One of the selling points was the one year warranty they provided on their workmanship. About 3 months after the job was complete, I discovered an electrical outlet was not working. A call to Gina got a quick response and the electrician came out right away. The power to the outlet was restored. There a need to patch some dry wall, prime, texture and paint. All this was handle by Gina, quickly and efficiently. She was on the phone to keep me up to date on arrival times, etc. This continues to be a great experience.< /review>< Rating>

<text>Treeium has remodeled two bathrooms for me and my experience with them has been excellent.   I encountered a small leak problem with one of my showers.  I contacted Treeium Quality and spoke with Gina.  She is very knowledgeable, positive and extremely helpful.  She took charge of the problem and arranged for it to be repaired quickly and to my satisfaction.  Gina takes her role at Treeium very seriously and is a tremendous asset to Treeium.  I am very appreciative of all of her assistance in resolving my issue in a timely and satisfactory manner.</text>< rate>

<Text>My dad had to have a hip surgery because he fell while trying to go above the tub into the shower, between medical fees and his condition our budget to remodel the bathroom and convert it to a walk in shower was really tight, we met with 5 different contractors that all wanted to do a full bathroom remodel that just wasn’t in our ability to pay. Shahar Algazy met with us, really understood our needs and took my dad’s case personally , he offered to convert only the tub to a shower and everything else would stay as is in a budget of under $10,000. He called his manager and asked for a personal favor to get it approved and Treeium literally saved us! It’s been a year now and my dad is doing much better and loving his new shower.

This was my first remodel so I researched and met with several companies before deciding to contract with Treeium to do my bathroom remodel. My project manager was Jacke Mair. When Jacke and I first met for the initial consultation, he was very friendly and answered all of my questions. He was very personable, respectful, and upfront with me. He didn't attempt to "sell" me on doing what I didn't want done nor did he pressure me to do business with the company. We had a good rapport, I felt comfortable with him especially since I wasn't going to be home when they started working on the bathroom and he was honest with me along the way.

During the remodeling process, Jacke Mair continued communication with me via calling/texting to let me know what was being done while I was at work. As things arose beyond his and my control while working on the bathroom (i.e. rotten beams and no insulation--My house is over 90years old so hey it was inevitable ) He worked his magic to keep the price as low as he could and did some things at no additional charge for me which I'm so grateful for since I am new to remodeling my home. The work done was per our contract with what I wanted done and with what Jacke advised needed to get done for the bathroom to be up to code. Even when I would occasionally add more things for him to do he would offer great suggestions on what would be best to make the bathroom look great.  Everything was in writing so neither of us would forget what needed to happen for this project. We even referenced the contract during the remodeling to be sure everything was being done.

I even asked if Jacke could have his team install a storage cabinet for me in my other bathroom (outside the scope of our contract) and he was able to get that done for me at no charge. Now I can store my stuff in there too. It looks really nice.

The workers were friendly I didn't have much of an issue with them. Jacke Mair made sure the floors were covered so know damage would be done to my floors since I have hardwood floors throughout the house. He also provided a porto-potty so the workers would not use my bathroom as they worked which I appreciated. However, I didn't' care for the materials being left outside (even when the weather was bad) instead of being stored in the garage. The garage was difficult to open but just needed a little "elbow grease" to open but the new materials were not harmed which was most important.

All of the work done was by the book, up to code and no corners cut. It was great quality and well worth the price and time it took to get done. I don't even want to use the bathroom lol . I just want to have it for decoration.
Jacke Mair went above and beyond working on my project and I am so pleased with the outcome. He was more than willing to do all he could to make sure I was pleased and happy...and I AM!

The financing department was really nice. They answered my questions about the options they offered and was even available to answer questions after the project was over via phone/email.<//text>

I have been working with Treeium since January on a remodel/addition project.  My team of Luis, Shahar & Guy have really worked with us to make us happy.  When the electricity went out, Shahar & Luis were here at 10pm on a Friday night to make sure our electricity came back on.  When we told them of our expectations of how we wanted things to go, they bent over backwards to make sure thing came together, so we could get what we wanted.  I had worked with Treeium before on a paver project and was thrilled with their customer service.  I didn't know if they could maintain it on a bigger project and I'm just thrilled to say that they can.  I love my team.  They work hard to make me happy and the work is good quality.  We are still in the midst of the remodel, but I look forward to my home being awesome and the whole contractor/remodel experience being much better than another project I did.  I wish I had found them sooner.</review>

< Review>
went with treeium because of the reviews online as it's our first time doing a major renovation and well after a long process of delays and going over budget i will tell people to run away as far as possible.  Not only was this project a nightmare to deal with both personally and financially, after the project was completed we have had them come back 7 times to fix isssues over the course of 9 months.  Even now after 2 years we are dealing with this company because our contractor during the project replaced front windows in the front and never applied for permits to do so which they knew full well that they had to since all the original work had to be approved before they could start working and now we have a violation code on our house.  The funny thing is we never wanted to replace those windows but contractor who doesnt work for them anymore told us that water leak was coming from those windows, but long story short after project was done the paint kept turning brown each time it rained heavy (not often in LA) their crew finally figured out it wasnt the windows but the gutter was the cause and basically said we have to deal with it ourselves.  I'm writing this review now because they are not responding back to us now and their original solution was for me to pay to get the original new windows made and they will install it.  After spending almost 500k with them i'm done and will be fighting this.  For all those reading this run away from treeium.</Review>

Our project with Treeium involved a complete roof replacement and remodel of several bathrooms. The project manager, Guy Barnea, and the entire crew were great. It is not unusual to run into unforeseen issues on large projects but all were resolved easily,  Since the completion of the project there have been a few things discovered needing correction.  Treeium has been very prompt in addressing these.  Gina Cada and Gregg of the Treeium Quality Assurance Dept., have been very responsive and helpful in handling these matters. We truly appreciate their exceptional efforts to make sure we are happy with the end results.  Based on our total experience with Treeium we are very comfortable in recommending this company to friends.<//review>

<date>1592435711050< /date><Text>They completed a job for one of our bathrooms and it went very well. Even when we found there was a leak a few months later, they came back to fix it (and came back a few times after that too when the leak kept coming back). Gina communicated very well with me every step of the way and followed up diligently with how the project held up over time. She was the main contact, and Greg was the worker who came out. I had a pleasant experience with both.<//Text>< Pics>

Me and my brother inherited a house from our mom and it was finally time to remodel the main bathroom, we interviewed a couple of contractors until we met Shahar Algazy that we felt comfortable with, we explained Shahar that it’s the only bathroom in the house and timeline was our mine concern. Shahar worked with us with preparing all the materials before the project started and manage to remodel our bathroom in two and a half weeks! Amazing job by Treeium! We absolutely love our new bathroom - highly recommend. 5 stars ⭐️ ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️<//text>

< Review>
I'd like to thank the good people at Treeium, especially Gina and Greg and all the people at the Quality Assistance Department that help me out with my leaky roof. I had treeium come out two years ago to replace my whole roof, 2 years later we had a leak, even though we're out of warranty for the labor they came out and patch the roof for no charge. Gina was kind and courteous to help me with my problem, and stayed in contact with me till the issue was resolved. And Greg did everything he could to make things right. And stayed on top of things till the leak was fixed. I would recommend Treeium to anyone who needs any general construction done.< /Review>

<Text>I found Treeium on HomeAdvisor and hired them for a full high-end remodel of an existing 2,600 SF home in Playa del Rey, which was an investment/flip. They were well-priced, fair, very experienced and their workmanship was exceptional. They have multiple offices and a large staff, which was comforting to know going into the job. Guy Barnea and Ron Admony both acted as the PM's and they were fantastic. They were easily accessible throughout the entire process and the only change orders we had on the job were for scope that I decided to add at my own discretion. Would definitely use again.< /Text>< Pics>

I was refereed to Treeium by a friend of mine because he had heard the horror stories I've had with other contractors in the past. He told me they were professional, reliable, and high quality..and wow he was right! Best remodeling experience I've ever had. We did a complete new roof for our home and it came out beautiful. All the workers were very friendly, and I was constantly kept updated as the project was progressing. I strongly recommend Treeium and will for sure be using them again.</Text>

My experience with Treeium was amazing. I had my Solar Panels install and Danny was the gentleman who helped us and he was beyond helpful and attentive to all our needs. He was very informative and always answered all the questions we had.  He knew exactly what he was talking about and seemed very knowledgeable. My experience was great that I even referred my uncle and father in law , and they as well had a nice experience with Danny.  For any further projects I will definitely be contacting Danny and no one else.<//Text>

Well I need a plumber but according to another company I've worked with I need to replace my sewer so i am seeking council from other companies to make sure that the information that i am receiving is accurate and i have to say.. I am very happy that I called Treeium.. Even though they specialize in remodels they were very informative and instrumental in helping me confirm what my other consultations were indicating. very pleased with the professionalism</Review>

<Name>Jeff Ferrari</Name><review>We had Treeium remodel our main bathroom in the summer of 2019 and about 8 months later a problem was discovered as the crew had installed the toilet improperly causing water to leak and damaging our subfloor. We called Treeium’s QA / Customer Service Department and spoke with Gina who immediately sent out someone to investigate the issue, his name was Israel. Israel found the issue and documented everything with notes and photo's and Gina worked to schedule the repairs and obtain the needed parts to install the toilet correctly and repair the sub floor.
The repair work was excellent with Israel showing us and walking us through the process and Gina following up with us to ensure everything was to our satisfaction.< /review></record>

I was looking to upgrade my master bathroom as it was pretty old. I met with a few companies and decided to hire Treeium mainly because of their reputation and the professionalism of the project manager they sent over, Neev Kugel. He was very knowledgeable and managed to discuss everything in detail: scope of work, timelines, pricing, etc. I have never gone through a process like this before and Neev was able to simply break it down in a way that didn’t leave any room for questions. I was extremely impressed by his attention to details and little did I know how this would play a major factor throughout the remodel itself. He was on top of the project at all times and made sure I was always aware of what was going on in my house. When we met, Neev prepared me that this project would take anywhere between three weeks to a month. Imagine my surprise when the whole remodel was done and over with in two and a half weeks! I was so pleasantly surprised that I decided to hire Neev and the Treeium team to also take care of my Kitchen. I met with the Treeium designer and similarly to the bathroom job, the Kitchen was completed in a timely fashion and the end result came out beautiful!
To whomever is reading this review, don’t waste your time by looking anywhere else. I strongly recommend Treeium and specifically Neev Kugel to take care of any of your remodeling needs. They did an amazing job for me and I know that I will hire them again in the future! Thank you Treeium and a special thanks to you Neev for making this process so easy for me and for delivering on everything you had promised!</Text>

Three years ago, Treeium made renovation in our house. We were happy with their work until a crack developed between an old wall and new development.  We also found that a glass shower door is displaced a little bit but enough to affect its operation.  I contacted Gina Cada from Treeium.  She told me that our warranty has been expired but they want to do what they can to satisfy their client. She asked Gregory Knemeyer from Treeium Quality Assurance Department to make inspection of the issues and give me recommendation. Gregory came and made thorough inspection. He checked not only the issues I mentioned, but found a few more minor defects, which developed after renovation.  He told that the issues can be fixed, and most likely, Treeium will send their people to do the job. Then he arranged fixing the shower door with the subcontractor (who made the door installation). They came and fixed the door.  Gregory came by himself to fix the other issues. He spent more than half a day and fixed all problems. It was a pleasure to see how he works, thoroughly and accurately. Thank you, Gregory, very much! Despite that our warranty expired, Treeium did not charge me for this work. Thank you, Treeium, thank you Gina!<//text>

They made the whole process of purchasing and installing out solar panels very easy.  Once the permits were pulled, the installation and setup only took a couple of days.  The only issue we had was with the building inspector wanting any extra ground rod installed even though we already had two of them.<//Text>

Few years ago.
I chose Treeium Inc after speaking to 3 other companies. The deciding reason was that Treeium Inc was well established and the person , Shay Cohen,I spoke was patiently listening to my ideas to make my house modern and spacious by tearing down some walls.
Now, after three years I found some problems here and there but without not much headache,
Gina Cada who works at Quality Assurance Department of Treeium Inc has been helping me out.
Right now one of 48 windows replaced is becoming foggy and because of COVID -19 , I have to wait some time  but Gina is telling me what’s going on with the service to replace the window from time to time.
I was happy when the renovation was done and I am still pretty happy with after care provided by Treeium.
They have  good employees like Gina Cada and Shay Cohen.
I will chose Treeium Inc again if I needed.

< Review>
***********We came across a couple of issues and they were addressed promptly.**********6/14/17

***********UPDATE************
Everything was taken care of and I was given refund too. Different crews came back and completed the job.

***********UPDATE***********

Horrible experience!!!
The initial deadline was May 10th 2017. We were told that once the designer comes and makes a design it takes 3 weeks to finish the work. The designer came on April 7th and finished the design.
On May 2nd we were told that kitchen will be installed on that weekend itself which was May 5th. We went there on weekend and found out there was not even a single piece of kitchen whatsoever.
COMLPETE DISHONESTY!!
Then we were given another date of May 16th. Because of delay in tiles. Guess what no sign of any kitchen again. On 16th the job was assigned to different person without giving us a proper reason what went wrong and why the job was not done. We were told to forget about the previous guy and the new contractor would take care of us. He said he would HELP us and try to take care by following week Wednesday or Thursday by max. As if he was helping us for free!!! AND if you want to complain then call the company. Sir this is not called help you were trying to clean the mess that was created at first by false promises and INC 500 stuff whatever you called.
LACK OF TRANSPARENCY.
Now here comes the guy with attitude. What kind of contractor you are!!! Yelling at me and my wife just because you can not handle the client pressure.
TOTAL DISRESPECTUL. I AM ON VERGE OF ABUSING AT THIS POINT BECAUSE HE YELLS AT MY PREGNANT WIFE FOR THE PROBLEM THAT WAS CREATED BY THEM AND NOT BY US.
NOW THE ACTUAL JOB.
The job was started at full pace on the 16th and we got a little confidence that this guy will make it happened by Wednesday and latest by Thursday May 25th. By now we had to postpone are moving date from May 15th to June 1st. At this point we are paying $1000 for that additional 2 weeks of rent and $1800 mortgage just for those 2 weeks. What a waste of money after paying $30000 for this job!!!
Kitchen was finally installed on friday 19th and counter top on Monday 22nd. The backsplash was supposed to be done on Wednesday May 24th and guess what the subcontractor did not do anything on that day. I called the contractor next day and he did not even know that the other guy did not do anything. What kind of contractor you are that you do not even know if your guy works on a particular day or not!!! We paid you to oversee the job and now I am the one babysitting you guys.
LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY
Thursday May 25th, the guy comes and does the backsplash and does not do one side of the counter. I sent a text message to the contractor with the remaining problems. Now another lady comes in picture from the company and after all this headache we were told that on Friday at 7 AM they would come and do the finishing/touch up and leave. They came and put the hood and stove and left. Everything is still messy for me to clean.
At this moment the job is still not done as promised. The contractor denied to finish the edges between newly installed kitchen tiles and wood floor of the family room saying that is not his job. The wall was supposed to be painted with Egret White instead they just put white paint to make it look job done. TOTAL FRAUD.
The wall of family room right next to kitchen was left unfinished. The subcontractor discussed in very beginning that sometimes its hard to find exact matched color so if it was ok with to paint that whole wall. We agreed but I dont see anything done. They left open power outlets in the cabinet. Really??
We have been going through mental, physical, emotional and even financial stress unnecessarily by picking the wrong company for the this job. We did not receive the service in terms of quality and schedule promised. Money was not paid for this kind of service.<//Review>

<text>We met with 4 contractors and selected Treeium for our full down to the studs master bath remodel. Adam and his team knocked it out of the park and the project  ran like clock work. Everyone from Treeium was professional, on time and went the extra mile to make sure our house was cleaned up every time they left. The workmanship and extra care with the small details exceeded our expectations. We have done several construction projects over the years and this was without a doubt one of the smoothest I have been involved with. I would highly recommend Treeium.<//text>< rate>

I interviewed a few companies and found Treeium Energy to be the best of them all.  It wasn’t just the price, it wasn’t just the product, it was simply because the company was amazing and their direct sales manager Allen Ladd was the best.  He was very responsive, and honest and not pushy in the slightest.  After I finally decided to go with them, after numerous and numerous of emails, we started the installation not much longer than that.  It went better than planned.  Treeium ran a tight and efficient crew, that cleaned up after they were done with the backyard. This may seem like a small task, but when I had my roof installed, there were nails everywhere.  I wish I knew Treeium back then.<//Text>

<Review>Last November, I started calling around to get some quotes for remodeling my master bathroom.  I'd set a budget and wanted to plan ahead to keep the project on track.  I'd calculated that the best time for the work to begin would be February/March 2020.   Some of the contractors I called turned me down because the work wouldn't be starting immediately.  But when I called Treeium, the response couldn't have been more different.

Right from our first meeting, project managers Shahar "Shawn" Algazy and Guy Borenstein listened to my wish-list, got a sense of my aesthetic, and started making suggestions to realize my vision.  Their advice about materials and 3D rendering of the design were especially reassuring for someone undertaking a remodel on this scale for the first time.

The whole process has unfolded so smoothly.   I've been kept in the loop every step of the way.   Shahar in particular has stopped by regularly to make sure everything has been going to plan.  The crew has been consistently on time, amazingly friendly and polite and very considerate in cleaning up at the end of each day.    The team effort and spirit at Treeium is truly outstanding -- everyone I've talked with has contributed to realizing this vision.  Shahar and Guy are truly amazing!I'm extremely grateful and very happy to be part of the Treeium family.   Thoroughly recommended!</Review>< Pics>

Treeium is a fantastic company! I had the opportunity to work with them as a summer intern and was able to gain so much from their company. They are extremely accommodating and have superb service. Not only is the company well managed, but the quality of their projects and services are outstanding as well. Wouldn’t want to have shared this experience with anyone else!< /Text>

The Best To do it<//user_name>
< Text>
Erica was very helpful setting up our appointment for the free estimate. She took her time and asked questions to get to know us as potential clients and actually figure out what we wanted. She mentioned she makes her self accessible to clients 24-7 and that kind of commitment is definitely what we're looking for in a company. Her product knowledge amazed not only myself but my husband who is not am easy guy to impress. Based on her customer service we give Treeium 5 stars.its hard to find anyone in customer service now days who genuinely care about customers but she definitely was one of them, thanks for making the process comfortable and easy!</Text>

I can’t say enough about how awesome our experience was with Treeium.  From the beginning to the end, this process was close to flawless.  Sales people are usually dull and car salesman likes, however, when dealing with Allen he was sharp as a tack. He was also extremely honest, and which is hard to find in the construction business.  We decided to go with a Panasonic solar system which had an incredible warranty.  The return on investment for this project was 6 years… that means that after 6 years, everything pays for itself. I keep telling my neighbors but they just don’t listen.  Oh well, not my problem because now I have solar, and they don’t. What they do have is an ever increasing electrical bill.  We couldn’t be happier.</text>

The remodel came out looking great, both me and my wife love the new look. Recently we had a water leak coming from the bear foot claw tub they installed. I had to turn off the main in order to stop the flow of water. This happened on a Thursday and we would need our water back on by the weekend. I called Treeium on Thursday explained the problem and they told me they needed to look into it and would call me back. They called me back in an hour and told me the warranty had expired. They said they would still send somebody out on Friday morning. When the service guy arrived he looked at the problem and began to repair it. I asked about the cost since it was out of warranty and he told me no cost he would take care of the problem at no charge, they just wanted happy customers. That was a relief for me. He also took care of a few minor issues we pointed out as well. I'm so happy that Treeium stood behind there work, it makes me feel confident if we wanted to tackle another project with them.<//review>< pictures>

I am impressed with a quick response & informed call back from David. It was refreshing to speak David who explained their 27 yrs in business, along w/being licensed & bonded. He also reassured he will send the best Project Manager to meet our needs & have a quote within a suitable time.

It's been a year since my Treeium remodel project was completed and I can't say enough about the outstanding customer service I've experienced.

Gina and Greg from Treeium have been so helpful with addressing any small issues we've had with our project.

I had an few issues with the caulk around the bathtub cracking and turning yellow.  Treeium has always been quick to fix it.  It looks like the problem is solved, but Treeium extended my warranty to cover that issue should it ever arise again.

I've worked primarily with Gina and Greg in the months since my remodel project was completed and the process has been very pleasant and satisfying.  I would 100% recommend Treeium to friends and family that are interested in improving their home.

These guys rock!< /text>

Erica was very helpful setting up our appointment for the free estimate. She took her time and asked questions to get to know us as potential clients and actually figure out what we wanted. She mentioned she makes her self accessible to clients 24-7 and that kind of commitment is definitely what we're looking for in a company. Her product knowledge amazed not only myself but my husband who is not am easy guy to impress. Based on her customer service we give Treeium 5 stars.its hard to find anyone in customer service now days who genuinely care about customers but she definitely was one of them, thanks for making the process comfortable and easy!</text>

<review>I had Treeium come to my home roughly two years ago to do a room and kitchen renovations. I was amazed at the affordability of the project, the knowledge of everyone involved, and the customer service provided. It was the third renovation I'd had done on my home, and it was the first one that didn't have me feeling horrible after ward.

As an example, just last month I noticed what appeared to be cracking in the kitchen work. Gina Cada, one of the company's reps, went into great detail to explain to me how the process for review would work, when the work might be able to take place, and walked me through every step until completion.

I can never say enough about Gina, Eli, and Treeium. I hate having work done on my home, but now I know it's far less stressful with that team involved.

Thanks!</review>< pics>

We had a great experience with Treeium remodeling our living room (this included demo'ing lots of flagstone, designing a more modern fireplace, demo'ing a ponywall, painting, and replacing our bamboo flooring in the areas that were demo'd.  Guy Barnea was our PM.  He was wonderful to work with. He listened to our vision and offered great suggestions and the end project was more beautiful than I imagined.  I'm so so happy with the result. We were really pleased with the craftsmanship of the different workers.  They did a beautiful job. I had noticed some small details that needed fixing and it was never a problem to have the workers come back to perfect our project.  I was relieved that it went so well since I know remodeling can be a nightmare but honestly I can recommend this company without hesitation.  Thank you, Guy, for being such a pleasure to work with.</review>

Very professional outfit. I met with Shaun Shahar Algazy to get an estimate for our roof replacement. He was very thorough in his review and took a lot of photos. He wrote a detailed report for submission to our insurance company and got it to us very quickly. All throughout he was courteous and fun to work with. We didn't end up working with Treeium because of constraints related to our insurer, but given our experience, I would highly recommend working with Shaun and his company. Thank you for all your help!< /review>

<text>Treeium is as good as it gets. From the account representative over the phone to the initial visit with David, and the subsequent visit with David, Seda, and Adriana from the Treeium Gives Back program, I felt very comfortable entrusting them to remediate some mold that was found in the attic at our property.

My son was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in December, and if the the mold was not remediated, it could be deadly to my son.  On top of that our medical bills are going up tremendously due to the treatments my son is receiving.

Treeium helped us immensely by paying the remediation project bill for us. Now we can use the money saved to help treat our son, and rest assured that he will be safer from exposure to mold.

My wife and I are eternally grateful to Treeium and their staff.  Thank you!< /text>< Pictures>

We looked for more than two years for a contractor to do a kitchen remodel for us. Obviously I am not good at making decisions. Lior  Lazarovich. was our project manager and when he came to see us he promised us a lot of things. One was that the quoted price  was what we would pay. So we took a leap. Bottom line is we truly have the kitchen and dining area of our dreams. I was quoted 3 months for the job and it was finished in 6 weeks. We got semi  custom cabinets  and the quality is great. All with soft close and pull out drawers. They did everything I asked even when I kept changing the placement of lights and electrical. They did not stop till I was completely satisfied . Lior was extremely patient with me. I am very picky and expect things to be perfect. Lior made everything perfect.  I now have everything I ever dreamed of thanks to Lior.<//review>

I'm rating Gina Cada on behalf of Treeium with this FIVE Star rating. After a few months of having our Milgard Door installed we had issues twice with it. Gina Cada has been there every step of the way of insuring me that this matter gets resolved. The first time Milgard came out they fixed the door, but only lasted a day. Gina Cada called Milgard with my issue, stating that the door wasn't fixed. She arranged with Milgard Service Guy to have the whole entire locking mechanism replaced. She would constantly text me keeping me posted when they will arrive. When they arrived they replaced the Locking Mechanism and now works smoothly.

I would like to express my appreciation to Gina Cada, Treeium’s Customer Service Staff, for her excellent service and continued commitment to Customers.

Gina was my Go-To person in 2017 during the installation of my patio cover by Treeium.  She provided valuable help in terms of timeline, availability of the crew, and other useful info.

Two days ago, I called Gina regarding the pending minor repair on my patio cover.  She promptly scheduled the repair and today, I am happy to say that the job has been completed.</review>

Amazing company to work with! I've been working mostly with Etel Littman one of the project managers. I'm a vendor for bathroom vanities I must say working with Etel as always been great.
From the start I could see that she truly cares for her customers, she will make sure all colors and materials are the same as the customer requested. She will always make sure her customers are 100% happy.
The communication between me and her has always been fantastic.
I highly recommend to anyone that is looking for a great service, high quality and headache free project!</review>

<Review>I had a full roof removal and replacement, which included removal of the old swamp cooler.  Here in LA, it is now required to have a "cool roof", which is what I got.  The Treeium contractor, Eli Gerloy was up front and honest about the products available, the time it would take, and financing options.  I am a vigilant homeowner with quite a set of do-it-yourself skills, but roofing is not one of them, so I was happy to pay for a professional job. Mark, the roofer, was kind enough to keep me posted on the progress, and each step involved. The roof was done in less than a week, including multiple inspections throughout the process.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1533322930452, 'text': 'Hello Todd Sherry,\n\nIt was a pleasure to have worked on your home! “ Eli Gerloy ” is a highly skilled project manager and has a tendency to listen to his clients and their needs.

Treeium is a good solid company. I had my roof replaced and solar panels installed last year. The project manager came over, spent time with us to understand what our need are  presented us several options which made it easier for us to choose what was convenient and affordable for us. The installers were always on time and super friendly. I had a great experience with Treeium and am delighted and very satisfied with the final products.</Review>

When I called Treeium about service at my place, I spoke to Gina Cada and she followed through until all the work was completed. Even after the work was completed, she called to follow-up asking if everything was still working. I never felt so comfortable about a service before. I appreciate the service Treeium has provided for me and my family.<//Review>

<review>I met with Shahar Algazi from Treeium few months ago. Shahar came to my house and performed inspection for solar panels installation and roof replacement, we decided to go with him right away. He was super helpful and helped me throughout the whole process of tearing my roof until the last panel was installed, including the day after everything was done - he came and inspected himself to make sure we’re happy with the results. Thank you so much for the great experience, will definitely recommend my family and neighbors 🙏🏻< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><UserId.>100866897941033332850</UserId.>< rating>

Treeium is a really great company filled with amazing  people, they are really some of the best in the home remodeling industry.

Don Mkhitarian - project manager who worked on my garage conversion - was truly a pleasure to work with.  He was extremely knowledge on the scope of work, friendly, and responsive.  He had a "no pressure' approach and answered all my questions - which can not be said for other companies, where they would do and say anything to gain your business.  Don is the main reason why I chose Treeium over others.  I would recommend Treeium - and Don if you have any home improvement projects.< /text>

We interviewed 7 contractors to work on my dad's home remodel. We had such a very, very bad experience a couple of years ago with our own house that I could not put my 91 y/o dad through the same. You would think that 7 was over kill, but in the end there was only 2 real contenders. His home is over 60 yrs old and we had no idea what's going to happen once they started. I wanted a company with experience, expertise and enough crews to get the job done. I actually picked the other company, but Treeium's Shahar Algazy was very diligent, persistent and actually came down significantly to meet my price from his original bid. Treeium has lots to offer because of their size. You can tell they cater to their customers. Love their customer portal, no other company had this. All contracts, change orders, documents and payments are through the portal. It stores everything, so you can track progress, payments, balance. There is even a photo gallery that all of their crews can upload pictures of the project, so no question on what's going on. Also helps if you're traveling during project. We did have major issues once they started on a relatively easy bathroom project. There was a fresh water leak that had been there for years and a lot of unsafe electrical connections throughout the house. A big concern since we are trying to bring my 91 y/o mom home to be with dad during their last years. Money was running low, so Shahar referred me to their finance staff. Treeium helped in a huge way because they offered a "same as cash" retail installment loan which funded $45K to finish the project. Approved within minutes. We needed fast cash because our re-finance was going to take over 30 days to complete. If you payoff within 12 mos, no monthly payment, no interest. Can't beat that. Can't say enough about Shahar. Answers and sends text all the time. Very trusting and compassionate. Easy to talk to even with when issues come up. He understands and had much patience with my father. He treated him like family and made sure that all crews did the same. They ended up doing major work on the house, my dad refused to leave until the last minute, so everyone did their best to keep the work areas safe for him to stay as long as he could. Didn't plan all this extra work, but they proved that it was necessary and so glad that we chose Treeium. Can't imagine if we would have selected another or smaller company! We are going to use them for some work on our house and so is my sister.<//text>

Etel Littman was our project manager and from the very first meeting Etel was just fantastic.  She listened to our fuzzy ideas and asked great clarifying questions to focus on what we really wanted.  This is our first remodel experience and she made it wonderful and easy.  She really walked us through the process the whole way and helped us protect ourselves from less honest contractors.  Our final inspection is tomorrow and the bathroom is just perfect.  The work quality was fabulous and the team of workers were always polite, conscientious, and hard working.  It was such a great process that I recommended Etel and Treeium to my mother who also wants to remodel her bathroom. I trust Etel to do a great job and to live up to my mother’s demands.  If you are looking to remodel your home, Treeium is just a great company.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>{'time': 1564687447001, 'text': 'Hello Sarah ,\n\nI would like to thank you for taking the time to write a review about your experience.

However, Michael Soroka wasn't great one to work with. Also watch out on what brand of the products you getting, mine was misbranded. Michael promised to credit me back the money since the brand doesn't match but I never receive it.

In the past when doing construction to my home, the experience was an absolute nightmare.  Therefore I was really careful in choosing a contractor.  I heard of Treeium from a friend of mine, and they recommended I speak to Allen Ladd, because he was a trust worthy person in an untrustworthy world of contractors.  Allen was able to explain to me via email and text message the whole process of going solar. The installers did such a phenomenal job, I decided to get an Amana condenser and furnace. Once again the process was flawless.  I have now recommended them to 5 more customers, and it’s only been 6 months.< /Text>

After interviewing several contractors for a kitchen remodel, I chose Treeium because of Avi Shushan. He was by far the best Project Manager I spoke with. I signed a contract and placed a deposit to start the designing process of my new kitchen. Unfortunately, life happened and I could not follow through with getting the designs or remodeling. Avi Shushan, understood my circumstances and didn't hold me the contract for the designs and offered to refund my deposit. I will be working with him and Treeium in the future.<//Text>

<review>We are very happy with the job Treeium did. The cost  of the project was good. They fixed the mistake done by another company, by removing our load-baring wall, did our floors, installed a new electrical box, added recessed lighting, backsplash to kitchen, flooring throughout the house and kitchen, added central AC/heating, painting. They showed up when they were scheduled. Very clean, curious and professional. Ron our Project manager was awesome. We were always able to get in touch if we had questions, he showed up to check on jobs regularly. When I had an issue with another company, he was able to show up the next day with a crew and fix it. We would recommend Treeium to anyone, Very Happy!< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Construction is not something to dread with this company!< /Text>

<review>Estimate requested.

Showed up, and were on time.

My estimate had no dollar amount. I was informed it would be “a lot” and may be “too much money” for me.

I guess I didn’t fit the description of a person who has it.</review>< pics>

Total bathroom gut and remodel. Six Windows replaced.  Demolition of a stone fireplace with new drywall and texturing to replace it. Painting of entire interior of the home. Removal and replacement of kitchen tile.  We are thrilled with the craftsmanship of their work. Eli was very responsive as our lead contractor and was aware of our crazy time constraints, as we had to be in our new house in only 3 weeks.

I had a terrible accident happen to my home and Berry came out and showed me his license (this is very important!!), gave me an estimate (in writing), helped me come up with the best plan and finished BEFORE the original date of completion. I could not be more impressed. This will be the company I do all my home repair business with from now on. Thank you Berry and TREEIUM!< /text></record>

<review>We have had Solar now for over a year and still continue to love it .  Thank you for the Treeium team, and my project manager Allen Ladd who allowed me to save enough money for me to take my family on a 2 week cruise starting at the end of the month.  With the amount I saved using Sunpower panels, It really was a no brainer, and am truly surprised more people still don’t have it. The install was simple, and the communication was awesome!

I haven't yet received any home improvement services from Treeium as of yet but I would like to comment on their fantastic customer service. We had a representative come to our home and show us possible upgrades for energy efficiency (ie windows and insulation). After the thorough presentation however the representative (Marcelo) had an unfortunate accident and damaged our expensive new table.

Directly Marcelo had left we were sent an email in response to an inquiry on repairs from Marcelo and from their Risk management department at Treeium who said they would take care of all our repairs. We were reimbursed promptly and without any issues.

I just think based on how they treated us for an unfortunate accident I know they'd give me equal treatment during any projects we may get from them. They were just fantastic.

I am definitely keeping them in mind for anything we plan to do in the future. Thanks Treeium for turning an accident into a positive experience!< /Text>

We are merely at the bidding stages for our roofing project, but I can say the customer service over the phone with Erika Walker is far and away the best we have experienced with any of the contractors we've worked with so far - very polite, professional and helpful.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>I got stuck with Treeium while doing a bathroom and kitchen remodel through Lowes. (my first mistake)
Long story short. The job was quoted to take 6-8 weeks but the job actually took 23 weeks.
I lost upwards of $10,000 in lost wages because I had to babysit each worker sent over by our lazy contractor ( he was was on site less than 8 times in 23 weeks) otherwise tasks didn’t get finished and caused further delays and scheduling problems.

In the end I redid a large portion of the work myself because it was quicker than calling Treeium to come back 2, 3 and 4 times to finish what should have been easy jobs.
Their quality control guy eventually came out and even he left a job unfinished and never returned to fix it.

I had to argue for reconciliation from Lowes and eventually got a few thousand dollars back but nothing close to what I lost in wages and time due to Treeium’s incompetance.

Stay far away from this company and Lowes<//text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c297179484fbd3:0x34c84ecb9ad59c</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<username>Karen Williams<//username><Review>I have had experience with one other "5" star company and all I can say is not all 5 star companies are the same on Home Advisor. Treeium is a true 5 star company-a class act, a family-like company. First it started with Liran who wrote in detail exactly what we would expect in remodeling our 1970's kitchen. As with some companies, we were not pressured. Next came Natalie, a first class interior designer who did a computer model of our new kitchen in detail. She brought samples of cabinet finishes, back splashes and paint to go with the countertops we had discussed with Liran. During demolition the crew discovered the outside kitchen wall was soaking wet. The wall board and insulation was removed and Liran was called. When our new shower was turned on, the water was running down the wall from a broken drain pipe that had been caused by another "5" star company when they replaced the upstairs shower and plumbing a few weeks before. I can't imagine what the damage would have been if we had waited the 3 years to remodel the kitchen as originally planned. Liran came right over to assess the situation and got the repairs done ASAP. The rest of the remodeling came together with no problems and the end result was exactly what we wanted. Unlike the other company who left as soon as the inspector signed the report, Treeium paid attention to the finishing details. All I had to do was text Liran with what I wanted done and it was taken care of; to fixing spots on the ceiling to moving a drawer in one of the cabinets, even the tiniest finishing details were taken care of. I would not hesitate to recommend Treeium and make our kitchen available for viewing by potential customers.</Review>< Resp>

I’m not sure if I ever left a proper review for my wonderful Treeium team! I can’t recommend Assaf Labi enough. I had my whole condo remodeled by his team and they did an amazing job. He was very communicative, organized, and respectful! I was given clear instructions on where to go to pick materials and furnishings, and all of the stores had great selections. I’m very happy with this remodel even a year later. Recently our shower rack fell out of the wall (not because of the install, but because of the very old crumby drywall in my building) and Assaf quickly sent a repairman. I highly recommend working with Assaf and Treeium!< /review>

<Date>1548385395677<//Date><Rating>4< /Rating><Review>We still have several ongoing projects with Treeium. It's perfect for our need being a large company they offer finance options we can take advantage of. This review would be for the complete bathroom remodel. It would've been 3 stars, but they got an extra star because they came back and fixed issues that we felt shouldn't have been there to begin with (i.e. centering the sink counter to the vanity, mirror not centered and one end lowered than the other (didn't use a level?), light fixture not centered, another coat of paint needed in some area and getting the line straight). They have different person(s) that take care of different phase of the remodeling. The demo went well and took care of covering and protecting the washer and dryer, the hotmop was done right at the end, though I wished they had taped the door like I asked to keep the smell away from the rest of the house. Tiling was excellent, but it was explained to us that it couldn't be as flushed because the tile is not flushed..., what do I know. Our project manager Aviv aswered all our calls and text even through the evening since we could only visit the hardware store in the evening after work to go over the project with him. The project took longer than expected because sometimes the worker forgot or should've known but didn't know to bring things they need for their job, such as not having to wait an extra week to make use of our new toilet becasue they didn't have the seal after they installed it. Yes, these seem to be small issues and there were others, they did come back to fixed the issues. Being this is the first time we work with a contractor, we didn't know what to expect, but it's been a good learning experience. Treeium is a good company since they make sure they get the job done right at the end. What have we learned: 1. We will personally mark each item/area to be demo before they do the actual demo! 2. Make sure everything that needs to covered and protected is still intact before and after any job.</Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

Lior was amazing from the start! I called the 800 number on a Saturday and he was at my house to assess the project on Monday. Other GCs we contacted before we knew about Treeium didn’t even get back to us until the contract was already signed with Lior! He’s incredibly responsive. Very knowledgeable. No games. Even his team has been great to work with. I could not imagine going through this lengthy and challenging process with anyone else. If you want the least stressful renovation from start to finish, give them a call!</Review>

<time>1539632372180<//time><rate>5</rate><text>My second portion of the job was completed as I had liked. I know that I am known to be a bit of a perfectionist, but it is my residence and I plan to be living in it, with my family, for a very long time! Having said that, Treeium Company also understands their customers and will accommodate to your requests. I have been very satisfied with the customer care and at times when a portion of the job needs a revisiting, this does happen in construction all the time so do acknowledge it,  they will accommodate.  Guy Borenstein (project manager), Maya (supervisor for the bathroom remodeling), Elizabeth Camarena (customer service and payments), and Rivka Maman (payments) worked with me to make my stressful experience much less than it could have been.

Maya treated me as her “nephew” and told me her ideas and gave me the final decision making opportunity.  She was with us for the duration of the project of my daughter’s bathroom remodeling. My daughter loves the final product and that means the world to me!

Elizabeth Camarena, was and still is the “sister” for me in the Treeium Company.  She treats me with respect and keeps me informed with all the payment status.  Rivka took over the duties from Elizabeth for a short time when Elizabeth had a leave to have her beautiful healthy baby. Rivka was also very professional and did treat me as Elizabeth had done.

I am very happy with the workers that work with Maya, but shame on me for not remembering their names.  They worked tirelessly on my house as if it was their own and I appreciate that very much!

I have news for Guy and the Treeium Company!  I’m BACK and you will be hearing from me soon for the next project. Yes! We are moving to the 1st floor remodeling.

We have a very large project which included new A/C, Window, Kitchen, Fireplace, Bathroom and other safety issues corrected.  The crews were very professional, clean and courteous.  Our Project Manager, Elad Hadar provided many creative and money saving ideas.  Although this was a large project, Elad made it possible to renovate and still live in our property.

Thank you Treeium!</text>

Our experience with Treeium and Avi Shushan has been great! Out of all the bids submitted, Avi was definitely the most knowledgeable, helpful, and professional. He has been very responsive and communicative. As a homeowner, any renovation project can be nerve-racking and difficult, but Avi has made this experience very easy and efficient! They also have an online platform where you can pay online, which makes the process even easier! I highly recommend Avi's services!< /Text>

Treeium started off as a promising venture for me. After signing with another company, they were helpful and honest in outlining for me the grave mistake that I had made in doing so. The representative with whom I spoke, who's name was Elad, was incredibly eager to sign a deal, promising that I would pay slightly less than the other company was willing to do the job for. If you are reading this, I am here to tell you not to believe a word these people say. Half of the work done was ineffective and entirely unnecessary. He wasted my time beating around the bush with complicated language that was meant to make me feel like I should trust him, while keeping me in the dark as to exactly why. I didn't understand, but I believed him. My mistake.< /Review>

< Review>
I had a great experience with Guy Borenstein from Treeium. I had bought a house and it turns out there was an unpermitted room that needed to be brought up to code. They came in and did a great job, including replacing the foundation WITHOUT having to take out the room.

The only downside was dealing with an inspector determined to continually finding new piddling things for the workmen to do, things that made the project take far longer than it should, but that was not Treeium’s fault. Some day there should be a class action lawsuit to hold some city departments responsible for the harassment they inflict on homeowners. Problem is they have a monopoly and can do whatever they want without fear of being held responsible. THAT, however, is a story for another day.

Thank you Treeium!</Review>

We just had our kitchen remodeled and WOW is the first thing that comes to mind.  Lior Lazarovich, our Project Manager was awesome, and I couldn’t be more pleased with the work done by Treeium.  From beginning to end Lior explained the process and helped us in choosing the right colors, appliances, fixtures, and tiles to really make the house look awesome.  Thanks again Lior and Treeium!  We can’t wait to start the next project in 2018, the guest bathroom!</text>

<Text>First let me say we are pleased with the company and especially our project manager Lior Lazarovich.  He was thorough in explaining about the company, communicated what would happen each day, and got back to me every time I had a question (which was often!). Being construction, there were a few hiccups, but Lior constantly assured us that they would make sure we satisfied with their work and the final result.
Teams that came out were polite, worked well and seemed to know what they were doing, and for the most part, cleaned up the area very well.

Why 'only' 4 stars? There are a few detail/finish areas that need addressing - which we were assured by Lior would happen with big remodels -  and that we should call them to remedy. If they come out and do that, it will set them apart from the competition & they will definitely deserve 5 stars. (hopefully update coming soon!)< /Text>< username>

<user_name>Lawrence Palacio< /user_name><rating>5< /rating><review>We bought a new house in a new community so our backyard we just dirt and rocks. After talking on the phone with a couple contractors and having one come over for an estimate, I was starting to develop anxiety on choosing the right person/company.  My wife did some research and discovered Treeium. We were impressed with the before and after pictures on numerous various types of projects. We set up an appointment and was greeted by Project Manager Moti Broogell the very next day. He was very professional, courteous, and creative in helping us with our backroad design. Initially, we were only thinking of having pavers and a lattice patio cover...even then we were skeptical if we could even afford it. Moti informed us of a couple government sponsored programs that finance "green" renovations to your home (Hero and California First). With a $1000 security deposit, we were able to get the pavers, lattice, artificial turf, AND solar panels!!! We chose California First and was approved for 15% of the value of the home...we didn't use it all but we were so amazed how we got everything done. Moti and his team was able to complete all the projects in one month and our backyard is absolutely beautiful!

Moti was a great communicator and a passionate professional throughout the entire process. He quickly addressed any issues that came up and made changes without any hassles. He really cares and wants you to be happy with his work. Our backyard looks so good, neighbors would knock on the door to ask about Treeium. Bottom line if you want a one-stop shop company that does it all without any pushy or up selling contractors, then Treeium, Moti, and his team is who I highly recommend.< /review><userid>115002354492850114760<//userid>< pictures>

I was looking to increase the energy efficiency of my house as it was poorly insulated. I called a few companies and decided to hire Treeium to conduct an energy audit for me to better understand what I can do to improve my home. Upon receiving the energy audit results, I met with Treeium’s project managers Neev Kugel and Avihen Levanon to go over the scope of work involved with the energy audit results. I was so impressed with their knowledge, demeanor, and the fact that I didn’t feel pressured to do anything, that I decided to go ahead and hire them to do the work for me which included: wall and attic insulation, exterior paint, main electrical panel upgrade and replacing my windows. Neev and Avihen made sure to always keep me posted regarding the project’s progress, they were very quick to handle any issues which came up, and overall were extremely professional and efficient in making sure everything ran like clockwork. I was so impressed with their work that I decided to also hire them to take care of my front yard and install drought tolerant landscape for me, and I must say that it came out BEAUTIFUL!
Thank you Neev and Avihen for your continued care and service throughout this project. It was a pleasure working with you and I would strongly recommend Neev, Avihen and Treeium to whomever is considering going through their next remodel!</Review>

We were looking an energy efficient remodel that included air conditioning, new lighting, insulation and window replacement, a new electrical panel and were also considering solar. We turned to Treeium because we needed a contractor that was eligible to work under California's P.A.C.E. program (we went with Ygrene for financing), and could cover the full scope of services. My main points of contact were Neev Kugel and Ofer Dub. I found them to be both very responsive to our needs and schedule and pragmatic in their approach. The scope grew to include a rewire based on needs dictated by living in an old house, though they also recommended to wait for solar before understanding the new energy dynamics post-improvements, which insured the investment was going to the most needed items. Everything was seamless between Treeium and Ygrene. They went the extra mile to make sure we were satisfied with the work. Highly recommended.< /Review>

<Text>We had a major remodel project, new kitchen, three bathrooms,and powder room. Kobi Farkash was our project manager, always responding quickly to any questions and concern we had. The workers were professional.  The job was done on time.   One  concern or disappointment  was the exterior clean up.
newertheless, I can recommend Kobi and and team at Treeium.< /Text>< date>

<text>We were blessed to have our first grandchild, however we needed additional rooms for her and her mother. I conducted an exhaustive review of construction companies on the Internet, Yelp, and the Better Business Bureau with experience a positive reviews for second story room additions. Initially, I invited two construction companies to my home to submit proposals. One company wanted to build over the existing master bedroom and adjoining bedrooms. This would have resulted in the loss of hallway closet and master bedroom closet space. Not to mention, it would have completely exposed the ceiling areas to the elements during the oncoming summer weather.

Mr. Elad Hadar, from Treeium Eco Home Remolding came to our home and envisioned the addition to be placed over the dinning area and garage with a U shape staircase leading off from the patio to the second story.  His plan also allowed us to have a pantry underneath the stairwell and expanded a formal dining room  area where now family members and guests naturally congregate. Most of all his plan was more cost effective than the competing company.

As this was our first major renovation, we did not know what to expect.  During the construction process we did encounter some issues which we did not expect nor we sure on what steps to take to resolve these issues. But through it all Elad stood buy on his promises to make us happy and ultimately resolved our issues.  he made sure the our expectations  were met and his employees corrected it down to the smallest issue.

We might have paid more then what we could get it from other construction company, but now that the project is done, we are very happy with the results and we know we made the right decision.

We will defiantly call all him again for our next project and will highly recommend ELAD and TREEIUM to anyone who will ask us about a contractor.

Thank you ELAD HADAR!<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>{'time': 1522251704120, 'text': 'Hello Mark,\n\nI want to start by thanking you for the review and trusting Treeium with all your remodeling needs.

They did a great job designing and installing the sign for my boat! The name comes from something my grandfather would say when I was little and he lived around the corner from Easy Street in Highland Park, and I wanted it to look like a street sign.  This is exactly what I wanted. Couldn't be happier with the sign or the service.< /Text>

I've used Signarama for various types of printing over the years: banners, mock checks, wraps for vehicles and signs to attach to chain link fences. In each of these instances, the staff has been professional, courteous, prompt and skilled. You can't go wrong using their team for any of your work.< /Text>

Signarama to the rescue! Sometimes you need good signage fast, and Signarama helped me out of a jam. They supplied exactly what I needed, quickly, affordably, with excellent quality and service. Don't think twice, just call Signarama.<//Review>

<review>I used Signarama to create new letters for my boat.  Paying them to remove the old letters and install the new ones was money well spent.  Not a single bubble!< /review>< Pics>

<text>I used Signarama twice for banner making.  Both times I was impressed with the quality of the workmanship and the price.  My first experience was truly exceptional.  I had an emergency order (less than 24 hour turnaround).  I had been quoted over $300 by other local printing companies.  They wanted extra payment for the rush order, extra payment for design assistance, etc.  Signarama did it all for $100.   They were friendly, and their designer produced amazing work, and they rushed my order free of charge.

Finally, I’m not one of those people who regularly writes reviews.  I READ everyone else’s (thanks for that by the way).  I say that only to emphasize that it takes truly exceptional service and quality to get me to sit down and put finger to keyboard like this...that’s what you’ll get from Signarama.</text>< rating>

<Review>Worked with Signarama for Bus Decals for a film shoot. They did a fanstastic job and were able to do a quick turn around for us on short notice! Would definitely work with them again!</Review>< rate>

<text>I can’t say enough about Signarama! They nail it every time!  The proofs are what it’s all about! You know what you’re getting before it done!
They are quick to turn things out and so accommodating!

Price wise, they are the beat!

Thanks you once again for everything!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80dd31a73c24975d:0xab83d834f9f6df70<//gmap_id></record>

As a business owner and member of various associations, I have used Sign-A-Rama countless times. Not only will they sit with you to help you create or improve your design, their products are always high quality and never fail to meet my expectations. Their quality products and great service make them my go-to for any of my signage or printing needs. I highly recommend them.</Review>

These guys are top notch. They were able to get my sign made and installed pretty quickly. The sign that they created on paper was the one they delivered. It is nice to know what you are getting and then it be delivered as promised. This was my third building sign i had done and they have done lettering and a few other things for me and have always come through. Great job guys.< /Review>

We've use Signarama for all of our retail signage and window graphics.  At our last location the neon signage was still in perfect condition after twelve years so of course we called them for our new location.  It's awesome because they keep your window graphics on file,too and if you have window breakage or need a change it's ready to go for pretty quick.<//Review>

Disappointed, and disgusting. My wife sat there for over 10 hours with a blood pressure of 190/120 waiting and waiting and waiting, because apparently it’s fine to have a stroke or heart attack in the waiting room. With lovely signs that said if you are on your phone the doctors will skip over you and make you wait longer. Because that makes total sense with Covid and not being allowed to bring anyone with you. I’m so glad she was “taken” care of. Don’t go here if you have an actual emergency or are dying because they don’t care and will let you die in the waiting room. I am completely repulsed by the staff and honestly I don’t even feel sorry for the director of this hospital because this place is a joke.</Review>< Pics>

<Review>Worst hospital in the valley, they fail to update you on the care of your loved one status while in a trauma unit, while they are following strict and guidelines with unnecessary no visitation policy. Supervisor in Trauma unit emergency room, Annetta was extremely rude and unhelpful. They are extremely negligent with information regarding patient care to worried family members in critical condition. Disappointing to see hospital staff act in such ways. My father was moved and treated multiple times with out me being updated on anything going on.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
My mother was admitted last night with severe abdomen pain, she was sweating a lot and could barely walk. She had to wait HOURS just to be admitted.They also gave her nothing for it leaving her in pain. I was not updated on her even though I called multiple times. After her surgery, she was not given anything to eat and was also not helped getting dressed even though she expressed pain to the nurses. I am very disappointed in the treatment that she was given, do better. These bad reviews should serve as motivation, but clearly nothing has changed.</Review>

<review>Staff is very rude. Wouldn’t recommend going here. If you’re sick as hell, go to a different hospital, you’ll be better off at any other than here. The Dr i saw was friendly, so we’re most of the nurses. It was the LPNs who unfortunately made the entire establishment look like trash.</review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I absolutely agree with Terry K colombini that left a review a month ago.  The 2nd floor is an absolute nightmare. I was afraid all the time that I was there because of the poor care that I was given. I had major spine surgery and should have been on the 5th floor, but I was put on the 2nd floor and pretty much forgotten about. I was given something to eat and didn't get any assistance to open it or utensils to eat it with,, and when I did open it, all the fruit cocktail went all over me. No nurse helped me. They came in to drain  my drain that was in my back,  and never put the plug back right .  The physical therapist came in to try to get me up and I just broke down into tears. He finally got me up after he cleaned up the fruit cocktail.  Neither one of the 2 nurses that had come in the Room did anything. As he and I were walking down the Hall, the nurse walked by and said  OMG you have something running down your leg. He looked and saw that it was my blood. When we got back to the Room there was a puddle of blood that had started to mix in with the fruit cocktail. The nurses never cleaned me up from surgery I was still in the same linen that I was  in surgery because I could see the iodine all over it. They never showed me how to get cleaned up. The container that they normally give you, was not knocked off the table the 1st night I was there and never picked up. When I finally ask  if somebody was going to clean me up they told me I could use the wipies that were there.  I wanted soap and water, and a wash cloth, and I ask for a toothbrush and they brought me the toothbrush but no toothpaste. I was very weak and kept under heavy sedation. There was no one on the 2nd floor that new anything about how to care for an orthopaedic patient. My nurse call button was not attached to the bed as it should have been , and I could not reach it because I could not bend nor could I twist my spine and had to have the person in the Room with me call for the nurse. They finally took the IV out of my hand and left me, closed the door and that was the end of that. Finally, someone came in and I asked if i was leaving.  I was told once the IV was out I was going home, and they said yes. I pulled back the sheet and said even with this still attached?? They had left the catheter in me! The nurse said oh my God we are supposed to take that out yesterday. I tried to get up to walk around the other side of my bed to get the nurses call button, a nurse came in and was pulling the Walker away from me, and I said I really need this to get around the other side of the bed. She tried to pull it away from me telling me that it wasn't mine, and I told her well it certainly isn't yours!!  There is so much more to this horrible , horrible story, that when I ask to have discharge papers the executive in charge, that I asked for, told me I could get them myself from the records department. He gave me the number for me to call when I got home. So, honestly I didn't get any discharge papers, I don't know what I should do when I got home. The rest of the story is about me having to demand a wheelchair so I could sit down instead of just standing there.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO CRMC. MY FIRST BACK SURGERY AT CLOVIS HOSPITAL WAS BEYOND GREAT!! I'm looking into why I couldn't have this 2nd surgery also.  Something about a conflict with Neuroscience dept.  Oh!  I almost forgot about them not having one of meds that I take daily for depression and anxiety!!!  I asked 3 times to have them call my psychiatrist,  and they refused. Said they were trying to find a similar med.  Maybe thats why its taken me this long to start an inquiry, I can't even go to grocery store now.....way too many people, my anxiety is off the charts . Again, there is so much more.....<//Text>

My past 2 visits to the ER this week went really well..i didnt have to wait long to see the doctor or get test done..not sure if it was the doctor and rest of the staff that was on site at the moment..but they were getting there job done quick..unlike past times..dr. Boyd was a big help as well as a travel nurse that was there..forgot to get her name..also the nurse that did my MRI was very helpful in reasurring that i was going to b fine..its always nice to still have medical staff that still has a heart and dont make u feel worse then we already are..have a blessed day!</Review>

They forgot about my wife with a head injury, she was sitting there for 3 hours with three puncture wounds in her head. It wasn't until she asked a nurse what's going on did she finally receive some service. As an ex employee, I know about how "clean" the kitchen and dish room is and everything is basically just cleaned with water and the food is made 3 weeks before you eat it. But before it goes bad they serve it to all the patience. I've literally seen molded fruit come down to the dish room the same day it went out. I won't recommend this hospital to anyone that cares about their loved one. If you want the person to be in pain and feel like an inconvenience take them here. Negative one star if I could.<//review>< pictures>

The wait just to get a room in the ER is horrible.  You can wait either in the waiting room or hall way with the EMT'S for 5hours plus.  Then when you get a room in ER the nurses are rude and the DR'S could care less what is wrong with you. If you are in sever pain the staff could care less. I believe  this hospital 's moto is get in get them out and we don't  really  care.< /Review>

< Review>
My daughter had an appointment today with the oral maxillofacial doctor to get her biopsy results. And unfortunately she is feeling under the weather today and we live an hour away. I called and spoke with Maria the receptionist who took my call and was  EXTREMELY RUDE!!!
I Tried to asked her if there is anyway we can set up a virtual call, she said no I would have to take her in today! I told her the doctor had given me the option to call me with the results over the phone if we were unable to go in for any reason! Maria would NOT LET me finish my sentence as I tried to explain this to her!  As she  continued to interrupt she said no this should have been set up weeks ago and you have to bring her in Today!
I said OK THEN if I get there and am told she will not be able to get seen because she has a soar throat... she cut me off again! And said I cancelled your appointment and you can call back to reschedule when she’s better!!!!
I told her I would like a Virtual done! She CUTT ME OFF AGAIN 😡 Maria said Ill have the doctor call you at your phone number. (End of call)
Mind you the first time I called she was just as rude!!!

Overall the Surgeon who performed my daughters surgery a few weeks ago and the nurse were super extremely kind! But it’s people like Maria who give this place a bad review! So disappointing!</Review>

I give this hospital 2 stars because you wait a whole lot of hours to see a doctor you wait a
whole lot of hours to get meds for pain some of the staff has a really bad attitude at times and for visiting has changed to 12pm to 8 pm a ridiculous time I think but the only thing good about this hospital is that the doctors when they do see you try and help  you get well< /review>

The doctor's and nurses need to address there bed side manner's when it comes to a patient that is dying. If they don't have covid then there should not be a problem with them see people they know. ALL STAFF NEEDS TO WATCH PATCH ADAMS I MEAN SIT DOWN AND REALLY WATCH THE ENTIRE MOVE FROM START TO FINISH. People are not a bed number they have feelings and need know there friends and family still miss and love them before they pass on</review>

They made me feel like they cared, I was taken into a hall in the hospital. Although the wait was a bit long hey it’s understandable I know I’m not the only one amongst the thousands of people being helped, I saw how the nurses were with not only myself but other people, they do care about people and I’m really happy and very thankful they were able to help me out. This hospital has such a great staff and great care. I never want to end up in the ER but for sure will come here if it ends up that I need to. I will wait however long it is knowing I’m receiving the best care. Thank you all again so much.</Review><user>117251847570774192082< /user>< Pictures>

Only talked to a doctor once and that was because my father called me when she came in the room. I received no instructions on how to care for him, they just bought him out and dumped him into the car. I cant even get his medical records for two weeks because their Medical Records Department is closed to the public. The my chart activation code doesn't work, so we can't even look at what was done to him.< /review>< Response>

EVS department is horrible!! They treat their employees like dirt!!! They will wrongfully terminated you for something that was their fault! They will lecture you and make you come in early to get all of your stuff ready to go and while doing this we are not on the clock yet. They made me work when I was not on the clock and that is WRONG! Half of the time the supervisor are not around to watch the employees walk behind the gate that should be locked. Supervisors are late to work half of the time as well. There so many HIPPA violation in this department as well! Everyone in the EVS department needs to be retrained! Even if you are on your 90 probation they don't want you going to HR about any harassment or problems between other employees, because they see that as a problem so they will terminate you, because they don't want that kind of attention in there department. HIPPA violation there is a lot of it and it can be a lawsuit as well with working off the clock! As well for scheduling they have a lady name Blanca Sizemore doing the schedule and she has bad attitude and she screwed me off by not telling me about an email she sent out to Fresno Heart to remove me from their schedule after she had fixed my schedule! There so much more going on in this department I hope they get into trouble!

Human Resources I'm very disappointed in you! I called to received help and the lady name Lily is unprofessional and will interrupt you when your trying to explain the situation and things that happen and she still hasn't send me a letter that she promised me for their screwed up!!

<text>I think it's sad that during this pandemic, nurses don't have any compassion for loved ones who are calling in to check up on a loved one inside the hospital. Bad enough we can't be next to our loved because of this covid-19 virus.  My son has been in there for almost a week and they can't find out whats wrong with him.... I try not to call more than twice a day for the same reason, cause the nurses sound annoyed when I call in..I've had two girls that answer when I call, Diamond and Elizabeth who were really nice and compassionate and sound like they actually care. The sad thing is that ONLY one of his nurses has been nice when I call to find out status of my son, his name is Tim, that is really nice of you Tim.Every time I call and ask to speak to a Dr.   their response is he is busy, we will have him call you back. Like I mentioned earlier my son has been there for a week and the Dr. has reached out twice... I feel like the staff should be a little more considerate during this difficult time of the virus... to the staff; they are just patients to you , but to us out here waiting to here news from them, they are our loved ones! 😔😔😔</text><pics>None< /pics><userid>105350078543878504616</userid>< user_name>

I thought going to the emergency room that they were there to help me but they are just rude and ignorant. I hope someone from there would see this review and make a change to their overnight doctor staff. Not only were they disrespectful but I also found out from my Dr.  that they withheld pain meds from me when I went there for stomach pains and continued to suffer until i could see a specialist! I hope this redirects your choice in hospital emergency rooms and go somewhere else where they do care about you and for you! And to the "Dr.'s"  that obviously hate their lives over there....If you hate helping people in need please choose a different career other then healthcare!!.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

The burn center has the best nurses and doctors. I’m so grateful that my parents have good care. I will forever be grateful for everything they do. I’ve came to care so me for these individuals. But of course there is always one or two nurses that are just so insensitive and rude. Not going to name them but I cry leaving my parents knowing when I know they are working. I just feel hopeless that I can’t help them. I just don’t understand why these type of nurses even exist. It’s unfortunate.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>LITERALLY A ZERO STAR! So inconsiderate even when they messed up and made my loved one's condition get worse by negligence. I don't want to disclose all the info because that is patient privacy. But literally if someone's condition becomes bad all of a sudden someone should stay with the patient 24/7 or do something to prevent circumstances like what happened from happening. Because of negligence, his condition got bad in the worst way possible, & I'm hoping no one goes through this again or goes to this hospital again because this isn't the first time, but one out of many.                                                            READ THE OTHER REVIEWS!!!   It's COVID, so obviously you're not letting us see them, but at least take full responsibility for your actions and entrust us with the best care. Just because there's COVID, doesn't mean half of your patients can die in the ICU. But honestly this healthcare system is so messed up that's it's not even easy to sue them even if the mistake was clearly theirs. In addition, majority of the nurses were rude and do not understand the pain that a family member goes through, but instead talk in a condescending tone and even to the point where they were being rude/ignorant when the issue was being addressed upfront. Literally, we had to announce that something was wrong with the patient through many phone calls just to finally reach a nurse to go to that room. This case will not be settled because through this whole process we've all just been extra frustrated about everything than sad.< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>After 5 years of employment here I was finally terminated.   My crime was continuously reporting a doctor that refused to change gloves between patients even when those gloves were soiled with blood.  I learned today the manager that terminated me was promoted to a director position.  Be very careful here.   This hospital only cares about profit.< /Review><user_name>Ouroboros< /user_name>< Rating>

On the second the floor who answers the nurse call button is terrible !! Yesterday and 2 days in a row she has been nothing but rude to my mom. She should be fired . My moms been in nothing but pain and can’t eat or drink anything and she’s giving my mom a hard time for pain medicine . If the hospital can look into this this would be greatly appreciated. All of the staff is excellent and great except her. They someone nicer to answer the nurse call button. She worked yesterday and 2 days before that she works day shifts.<//Review>

<review>Community Regional Medical Center, Fresno must have been the brain child of someone who had A.D.D.
The reason I say that is because every time a new part of the hospital is completed, they move on to the next phase and completely forget about how patients are able to get to it or even how it connects to the existing building. There's an old sayin in woodworking, "measure twice and cut once" that should have been been applied here. It would have been nice to know before hand how easy or not it would be to get to the newest addition prior to it being built.</review>< Gmap_id>

My brother went in for surgery yesterday
I dropped him off surgery time 9:30. Surgery went fine. When I called about status I greeted with a How can I help u. Very professional. Surgery started at scheduled time. He was in post op. I think the whole staff did an excellent job. The only thing wrong with this hospital is the E.R. Well he had to go back his surgery was bad told to go to E.R.  got there at 3:30 and he's still sitting here 9:30 .6 hrs and nothing . Still waiting. You have to do something about your ER it's absolutely the worst. By reading these reviews you know about it too. But have done nothing. How many people have died in that waiting room. My god his surgery went bad but hear he sits. How long do u expect people to wait.
This is just awful. Please don't give me your standard reply. I don't want to hear it. I will never take him to that hospital again. The only reason we're here is because surgery was done here. And that didn't even go right or he wouldn't b here. You shouldn't treat people like trash. And where did u find the nurses n security guards ? Extremely rude. Not one professional in the bunch.</text>

Their ER lobby is small, so they didn't want anyone else other than the patient going in.
I took my husband in because he was in too much pain and so they didn't let me in even when I told them he needed help translating. They said to come back in 30min to see if they gave him a room. 2 hours later and no room yet. I see they keep letting other patients in with a visitor. It's just unfair, if you do this to us, why not everyone? I go every 30 min asking for an update and I was talking to the nurse and the security interrupted our conversation  shouting to me ask if I didn't hear the nurse.</text>

<Text>Broke my ankle playing futsal. Immediately admitted to Trauma unit, incredibly caring and welcoming staff. Whole process was professional and informative throughout.

Immediately scheduled for surgery the next morning, multiple nurses and doctors came to check in, make sure I understood everything that was happening. Surgery was top-notch, can't thank Dr. Davis and his team enough.

Super appreciative we have a hospital of this quality in the Valley.< /Text>< GmapID>

I seem to be the only person in the building with manners or that is remotely kind. I simply needed to leave a pee sample and get a doctors note and I have been here about 4 hours. They are calling about 1 name every 15 minutes and the last 6 names they called are people that are not here. Instead of moving onto the next name they give a blank stare and go back to hide and come back out 15 minutes later just to do the same thing. For the love of god please I know it isn’t an easy job but you have GOT to do better.

<Text>Checked into FRMH ER early in the day, my husband in severe side stomach pain. He could hardly walk or talk. I was told the hospital was on lock down due to too many patients and only the patient could be in the waiting area. To my dismay, he would have to wait alone  and I elsewhere outside of the hospital. After hours of waiting (outside) I came back to see if they were able to let me in with my husband. Still no. Unhelpful terrible service.<//Text>< GmapID>

I have been to this hospital twice about my knee. I had heard a loud “pop”. at work on 07-05-19. It is now 08-18-19 and the only thing this hospital did was give me pain meds! I already know, as I have mentioned to the doctors that it’s a torn ligament or tendon or both. A MRI was NOT ordered in order to see the severity. We all know that an x-ray will not show the severity. I don’t understand why this hospital responds to everything with pain meds! EVERYBODY IS NOT HOOKED ON DRUGS! My leg is still in mega pain due to the lack of attention from this hospital.<//review>

The nurse during the mid-day shift, Nicole R., was absolutely wonderful. Attentive, thoughtful, gentle.  However, I am STILL IN THE HALLWAY WITH AN ABCESSED, INFECTED OPEN WOUND. According to my lovely night- shift nurse, this is due to there being A SHORTAGE OF FEMALE BEDS AVAILABLE. 29 HOURS. IN A HALLWAY.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

This hospital sucks. If you have the choice to go somewhere else do so. My friend had appendicitis and was in a ton of pain. The nurses made him move around a bunch keeping him in pain and no one would communicate with each other about what was going on so it took over 3 hours for him to get pain meds. They kept asking the patient his location and who his nurse was when he had about 8 different people come in and out of his room and asking questions. Also made him sleep in a hall while waiting for surgery. From Montana and this place was a complete and total let down. The only save grace was one extremely kind nurse who helped us out. Trust me on this don’t go here. I’ve never written a review in my life and thought it necessary for this place.< /Text>

This is easily the worst hospital in Fresno and the surrounding areas. The nurses and some of the doctors on the 9th floor are absolutely worthless! A stuffed doll could take there place and probably be more helpful and A LOT LESS RUDE. I saw them talk down to people like they were nothing but a bother rather than a patient. Seriously go somewhere else. Clovis community is a million times better and Saint Agnes beats them all. Seriously look for any other place than this< /review>

<Text>Sadly the doctors here don't care at all, and make profits off their patients not helping at all, well at least my father and some other poor patients. I remember on the first of July and my father was ill, we went to this hospital and they said he had cancer, they were gonna do a surgery on him but had to wait for a SPECIALIST. For 4 days that they could've done a surgery on my dad to remove the cancer and always made an excuse that they will do it tommorow. Do you know how many excuses these people made? Well it was many from doctors. Then the day the Specialist told me that my father's cancer was getting worse and they could not do a surgery anymore. Then the specialists told me they'd do the chemotherapy in 2 days, we waited patiently. Until another excuse, that some pharmacy was still getting medicine, Really? Is there enough workers here? Because on Floor 7, I only saw a few doctors and nurses up there also on Floor 5 as well. I'm pretty sure this hospital does not have a good budget. So what I was saying was that when waiting for the chemotherapy, we waited 3 more days until they did. And sadly after 4 days of the treatment, which they didn't do for a week and a half. My father was at a serious stage at that time. And then that same specialists came over and explained that my father cannot be saved and he will die of his cancer. If you know what cancer he had. He had stomach cancer. He died at the age of 55, taken advantage by doctors making profit from his insurance. He was in the wrong hands of people. And I do not recommend this "Hospital" If you have an illness that clinics or small hospitals can't explain what you have. I'd rather prefer major city hospitals where they have more doctors and at least specialists. Don't make me feel better because these doctors had time to save him. I am only alone with my mother and 22 year old brother, I am a teen.</Text>< pictures>

The E.R. Dr. M was rude and condescending.  The E.R. nurses were foul, rude, and had poor bedside manner. I believe they broke H.I.P.P.A. law because nurses that weren't assigned to me kept asking why I was there, received the reason and then would  leave. Then there is a female transporter, I believe her name is Kady (??) She came to transfer me to Radiology. I mentioned to her that the resident E.R. Dr did not want me to leave my room because my health was unstable.  She immediately became  irritate and stated that I was refusing treatment  in a condescending tone. I politely told her, trying to catch my breath, that I wasn't,  just following Dr.s orders. She ripped off her gloves at once then stormed out of the room. She told my nurse that I refused and left the unit. My nurse and I were completely shocked and confused. Totally unacceptable and unprofessional behavior! I was transferred to 4 East (Tele unit).  The majority of my nurses needed customer service courses. I had a safety incident that occurred and reported it to two supervisors.  It was handled poorly and was not resolved during my stay. I witnessed nurses walking around with gloves on in the hallways. A nurse who came into my room with gloves on after helping another patient. I witnessed an E.R. nurse leave a full vial of Fentanyl in my room and then return to it 15 minutes later. I have had multiple hospitalizations at different facilities and this is by far the worst and disappointing as far as professionalism and integrity goes. Come on CRMC, GET IT TOGETHER! Your employee moral is in dire need!</Text>

The wait line is savage. Me and my significant been here for about 8 hours or maybe more. There are 6 people in the ER lobby and they can’t finished the 6 people who are ready to be seen. They keep calling names who aren’t in the lobby anymore and they go on the search for them. Another worst part, they called the patient names multiple times and they AREN’T in the building. Move on already. Also, we are waiting for a result from the checkup and they are taking forever to let us know. It has been 2 or 3 hours and nothing happened yet. This is worst than Mc Donald line and Doctor facilities. The workers are chit chatting with other co-workers and they are slow moving from one place to another. They got to chop chop.</Text>

<Text>Emergency room visit. I had an awful, extremely painful eye infection. I wear contact lenses and I couldn't  get one of them out due to the pain. An emergency room Dr. And his nurse who was all excited about this being her "first eye" began squeezing my eyeball and prodding around in my eye socket, couldn't find my lens which was right on my eye where it was supposed to be. NEVER AGAIN. Worse than when I went in. They wanted to attach some plastic gizmo to my eye and rinse it out with this gallon of fluid. No thank you rookie and Dr. Know Nothing. Resolved by my regular optometrist and a trip to the pharmacy. $3500 for that. Are they serious?< /Text>< Pics>

< Review>
I am genuinely curious how you can triage someone with a hard lump on their leg 2 weeks after having an angiogram (i.e. femoral catheter) so that they aren't even assigned a doctor for over 5 hours.

The doctor who did the procedure told this person to go to the ER at the hospital where the procedure was done.  Over 5 hours later, 1 set of vitals and blood work has been done. No one has checked on them, no doctor has been assigned, and she was brushed off the one time she got the courage to tell a nurse that her pain had increased.

How do you know this isn't a femoral aneurysm?  An infection?  This department is by far one of the most incompetent emergency rooms we have ever been to, and that includes the 8 to 12 hour waits we've had at Clovis Community (where the patient can at least have a family member present to look after and advocate for them).  I hope I never need to go to the ER myself.  I fear this ER would allow people to die in their waiting room.

P.S. The bathrooms are full of urine, fecal matter, and blood.<//Review>

< Review>
Women at ER front desk named Kristin or Christin gave me so much attitude when i asked if she can call the back to see if i can go back inside to the quiet room where i was placed after leaving the ambulance. She wont even bother calling the back nor does she care that i have blood all over me. She was going to have security escort me just because i was trying to ask her if she knew who i was here for so she knows when to call me. She smirked sarcastically and said yes and when i tried to confirm the name with her she continued to threaten to have the security escort me out. Petty woman. Bet she wouldve act a fool if it was her husband dying.<//Review>

My husband was transferred from our small hospital to CRMC with tachycardia and sky-high blood pressure, they left him on the gurney in the hall without food (his last meal was at 12:00 noon on Friday as of 8:00 AM on Sat. he still hadn't been offer anything to eat) for over 9 hours, he didn't get water or hydration for the first 4 hours and he had to ask for that.  The hospital response to negative reviews seems to be "we understand how frustrating long wait times can be." But leaving a heart patient without hydration or rest for hours isn't frustrating, it's dangerous.

My husband is home now, CRMC put in a pacemaker that he didn't need and didn't work on his tachycardia,  they kept him in the hospital for a week longer than was necessary before they could figure out the procedure that would help him.  When the hospital responded to this review I called them, got a message machine and they have not returned my call, apparently customer service for this hospital wants credit for reaching out  on Google but they don't actually want to resolve any issues.<//review>< date>

<Review>This has got to be a horrible hospital I would advise to not go. So a family member went in for leukemia, they had said he would be out in a month that he was recovering . Suddenly , they do a blood transfusion and put him in a induced coma to cover their mistakes .. they literally killed him , be advised that there is a cure for cancer that the government won’t release . Search it up they have it in Canada . It’s not right to let any human die without actually trying to save their life .<//Review>< user_name>

<Text>No procedure or surgery  done but charging my insurance an outrageous $43000 for my two night unnecessary stay. They still haven't sent any of us an itemized bill to show what they are really charging me for. What a corrupt medical system we have in this country

I was sent here from St. Agnes with fractured scapula, ribs and a slightly punctured lung. The doctors here were like vultures as they kept prescribing me the tests that were just completed at St Agnes. They were also not interested in helping me once I told them I don't live there which meant I will not be going to see them at their private practices during my recovery. They left me in the emergency room all night just because I refused the unnecessary procedures and scans. Nurse refuse to give me water even though the doctor has cleared it. I was tossed around recklessly by the staff even though I was screaming with pain. They moved me to icu even though I only have couple of fractures just so they can rack up the hospital bill. They billed my insurance an exorbitant amount of $41000 for my two night stay there. After this experience, I would rather die than ever end up in a hospital. It's a shame that all these medical professionals and hospitals care is to squeeze as much out of a patient as possible rather than truly caring for them<//Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

I know they work them hard, but I just felt like a number and almost nothing else. There were a couple who were more human about the care, and I am still appreciative of their service to our family, but if they were to just show even just a few moments of empathy, seems like it would go long way</Review></record>

Good staff that kept me informed on what medication I was given and what steps they were gonna do next. I was in and out of the hospital after surgery after less than 24 hours. Thanks to the nurses and doctors I didn't have to lose my toe. And special thanks to Dr. Pagenkopf.

Your experience is what you make it at this hospital And mine was great.< /text>

Very disappointed when I was transported to the ER on 6-4-19 I came in for shortness obreath and chest pain, I was treated by paramedics with nitro ect. When I arrived in the ER I was waiting for a bed, a dr came to talk to me I told him what was going on and that my cardiologist wanted me admitted for an inpatient cardiac MRI. This ER dr said he would get ahold of my cardiologist and freakin sent me out to the waiting room with nitro paste still on my chest. Sat in the waiting room, had blood work a few hrs later the dr comes out to talk to me and says “ oh I couldn’t get ahold of your cardiologist to see why he wanted to admit you so I’m going to discharge you.” And they lost my chart . This is very disappointing and  it made me feel like no one cared , I feel I should have Never been sent out to the waiting room and I should have had my vitals checked while I had the nitro past on, if this dr really felt this was not cardiac he should have taken the nitro paste off if he was going to put me in the waiting room. I never want to go to the ER again!!!!< /Text>

“I guess the patient is on a fast drip?” I stated my inference in a tone of a question after I noticed she changed the IV fluid less than an hour.

The nurse replied “what’s a fast drip?” confused, I repeated the word as I was perplexed for such a common word associated with IV intervention is not known to a professional.<//Text>

When I just had my baby they didn't let the baby father stay in the room durning the night which It made me really up set because I needed help from being in so much pain and the nurse seem like they were getting irritated from me calling them when I needed them and if I knew I had to share room with another lady that had a baby I most likely would of went to a different hospital the girl next to me was a teenager she had loud music and the nurse didn't tell her nothing.

the trauma team was extremely accident on it professional.  The recovery room after my very gnarly fractures was amazing!

But when you have to lay in the hospital bed for two weeks recovering, the nurses are very very lazy and seem like they don't like their job. At least that was my experience. I kept calling and calling and calling and nobody came to help me get off of this bed pan.

I am headed back here to get some more surgery done because my surgeon was extremely awesome! I will give you that< /Review>< pictures>

Thank you is not enough to the nurses on the fifth floor Denise (PCA) Nicole and Monica (RN) for the care my mother received you ladies made my mother's stay welcoming and that is something that is hard to do especially in nursing these ladies always had a cheerful caring smile every time they came in my mother has never ever told me with a happy smile on her face that she was treated very well and these three ladies accomplished that!!!! Thank you from the bottom of my heart!!!! Fresno Community is lucky to have you ladies!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️<//review>

<Text>Just wow, seeing the other reviews calling the staff lazy, uncaring and even blaming the President Trump for their supposed being racist?! All the negative reviews strike me as a bunch of people who don't know what actually goes on in a Level 1 trauma center and the degree to which the nurses, doctors, and support staff bend over backward pulling crazy long hours, often foregoing meal and bathroom breaks simply to check on a patient one more time prior to shift change to provide the most accurate handoff to the next shift possible. This is a top notch facility, with absolutely great practitioners and staff who deal with all the negative any poster could possibly point out about other patients day in and day out, meanwhile people seek to complain about having to deal with their fellow man for a few short hours often time waiting because they are not actually experiencing an emergency. The ER isn't a day spa, nor is it an urgent care. Thanks CRMC for saving people from Sac to Bakersfield!<//Text>< pictures>

<text>I'm here right now. I've been going through kidney failure I have a compromised immune system and they have me in the hall. Been here for about 24 hrs. And I noticed they're putting other people in rooms. And they told me I have to be in isolation but instead I'm surrounded by sick coughing people. A restroom with blood all over the sink. Now I'm afraid of getting sick and losing what is left of my transplanted kidney. What is wrong with these hospital. So 16 hrs later I'm still here in the E R with a failing kidney transplant and a compromised immune system. The restrooms have feces on the toilet as well as the sink. I am afraid I'm going to lose what's left of my kidney. I was advised by someone who commented on my review to ask for the department manager so I did and they told me they don't have one. I asked to speak with the head nurse 16 hrs ago and they did nothing.  Hrs later and I'm still waiting. I'm so afraid of losing this kidney. And I did not noticed that my spoon was on blood yesterday in the blue zone till after I ate. Now I'm really scared I might catch something bad. I'm losing my mind.< /text>< pics>

My nurse Crystal on the 1st floor was fantastic. However, the wait for surgery over 8 hours was frustrating.  The staff kept contacting the operating room which upset the surgeon. I know the staff was trying to be helpful but calling the OR not a good idea<//text>

GO LITERALLY ANYWHERE ELSE!!! Currently sitting in the hospital now. Was told I'd be here for 4 hours. I got my blood drawn and an IV stuck in my arm, just so they can tell me to wait for a CT scan. I wait so long that I fall asleep, wake up and my name is called so they can take more of my blood, but no word about CT scan... oh, did I mention they aren't letting me eat??? I haven't eaten since 11am, checked in at 5pm and now it's 2:15am, still no word about anything. *UPDATE* I'm about to pass my 12hr mark and even though my CT scan was 3 hours ago I'm still not allowed to eat, I'm not allowed to leave until a doctor reviews my CT scans which are inSTANTLY AVAILABLE TO VIEW BTW!!! I won't be updating when I actually get out. Never coming back to this place anyway.< /Text>

<Text>Was here on may 15 to get induced. Turned out to c section instead on may 16. All the nurses in the labor and delivery room were sweet and everyone in the operating room was professional. I really hated it after moving to postpartum because of one particular nurse there. I felt that she was too pushy. She woke me up at 4 am a day after my surgery and and 3 hours after being off magnesium and expect me to walk the halls. She went with me and held onto me but she walked so fast dragging me and I couldn't keep up. Mind you, my uterus was super sore and my incision was stinging with pain. I couldn't even do it. She told me I had to shower and wash my cut. She didn't offer any help at all. I asked to get my bed changed and instead of doing it she told me the nurse who was gonna do it went on break. So i had to wait for that nurse to come back. Anyways her name is Mercy. I really don't like her.< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>I like how clean it is, They seem to have a good system in place that I can appreciate.  The NP that I got was my problem. She was so horrible. I could tell she didn't want to help with my complicated situation at all.Was horrible. Instead of listening and being attentive she was rude and impatient.<//Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Amazing trauma center. Hospital is absolute garbage. They wouldn't allow a visiting Angel nurse to stay over night because they didn't want anyone seeing the inadequate care. Great for Trama, then get out while you can.< /review>

This was a nightmare! Nurses were bullies. Everyone was screaming at them for not doing their jobs! Beepers went on constantly. I still have a cather in. It hurts terribly! They refuse to remove it. I saw one doctor last night and it wasn't mine. No help, refusal to listen to anyone on the ward. This one guy was screaming all night. And there was a woman who kept saying "help me" as loud as she could. She needed to go to the bathroom and no nurse or assistant would help her. I Myself have not been issued my pain meds at the proper times. DO NOT GO HERE YOU WILL NOT GET REST NOR WILL YOU GET WELL!!!!!😪 They did not go out and get my husband. Every floor all medical information had to be redone. They forgot to put my husband down. It was first given to the register desk and every floor that I was on! This is the second time this institution where I have been ignored and not recieved received the proper treatment.  I am on the EROS program supposedly and none of those scenarios work for any floor on the hospital. Most don't even know about it. Wow  here's the kicker. They misdiagnosed my son's brain cancer.  He was gone a few weeks after that.< /text>

<Text>After giving ER all of the information upon intake for our daughter that they needed, they administered Haliperdol. I still dont know how much or why.  Because she was visiting friends they called to ask information. I explained that she is recovering from ADEM and it might be a flare. She was presenting to me as a flare. Since we are her advanced directive and DPOA they asked if she could have ATIVAN in order to run the MRI. I told them NO, she has adverse reactions to this and Xanax, please use 1 dose of valuim.v They ignored that and gave it to her anyway. On Sunday our daughter was lucid and sounded great. When I got there I found out they were still giving ATIVAN and Haliperadol cocktail. After making a scene and producing my credentials once again they finally stopped giving her the meds. Our daughter suffered for 6 extra days in the hospital while they were running all kinds of expensive tests, except for the ones they really needed to. They just didn't believe their cocktail was giving her flashbacks to her previous years traumatic experience with St Agnes and living with ADEM. The Psyc Doc got stuck in his own brain that she was a schizophrenic. Mind u I have close in-laws that have this condition. In my researching, I have found that Haliperadol can cause everything that our daughter went through from day 3 to unknown, can last up to 40 days and is life threatening. Because the quack on her case had no respect for not only her mom that has been there this whole year of recovery, dismissed my DPOA and advanced directive, and convinced all of the others on her case that she was a nut job, our daughter did NOT receive proper medical care. NMS could have long lasting affects. Proper treatment can be found if the doctors just listen.

6th floor acute rehab still ROCKS. We will always be grateful for that care last year.<//Text><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>{'time': 1555344897246, 'text': 'We are very concerned about your experience and would like to speak with you.

HORRIBLE!
The nurses like 5/10 are so rude, like literally bullies. some have been really nice & on top of their work but i felt like it was all the older ones, some of the younger nurses were just insanely rude, they work to fast to even get to know what’s going on with you & each time kept coming in & asking me questions about my condition, like did you not read my chart to see why i’m here??
i was sent to have my baby & instead of keeping me in a labor & delievery room like Kaweah Delta would have done they sent me to a regular room & one that i had to share again something Kaweah Delta doesn’t do & on top of that said if i get a roommate that my husband would have to leave & we live 46 miles away from the hospital that’s a 1 & half hour drive away & we don’t have the time or gas to be traveling back & forth like that & then tell us we can stay in a house called the Terry House but we will be charged 30$ a night, there’s no point in that. also said if i got a roommate my husband would have to walk all the way down to the 1st floor just to use the bathroom. i really don’t understand how such a big city has such a small hospital so small to the fact that they have to make patients share rooms, RIDICULOUS!  i didn’t like the fact that the rules were so stupid & strict, it doesn’t help the families who live far away especially when the patient is in a critical situation & needs their partners help. most nurses were so rude & worked carelessly. i would not recommend ever coming here willingly, EVER!</Review>

<Text>Way to long of a wait, E.R. nurses care more anout gossiping  than taking care of those waiting.After over an hour & a half, I had to ask how much longer I had to wait on test results after being told about 30 minutes. One nurse was VERY RUDE & disrespectful. When ask what Wal Greens I wanted my prescription   filled at they called it to the wrong one which was across town. INCONVEIENCE FOR ME. If this is how you treat all your patience I will go to St. Agnus from now on or better yet, go back to Kaiser. Every person who came in asked the same questions over & over again. I shouldn't have to tell 10 different people why I'm there. Your communication skills need sever improvement. No one should have to be there 7 or 8 hours and get absolutely no results</Text>< resp>

The billing department of this Medical Center is a joke! It has NOT even been a month since I visited CRMC and they were already calling me and bugging me about my bill. Are you serious? Who does that? They even threatened to take me to collections. ONCE AGAIN, it hasnt even been 30 days since my one and only visit. I'll definitely not be coming back here again.< /review>

Worse hospital I ever had to come to. Unprofessional and extremely rude staff.
1st  I was told by a staff member I would  not been seen unless I provide a social security number( in a emergency situation) although  I provided a valid and current medical id card.
2nd. My name badge used to verify me, my medications and what I'm allergic to was inputed wrong and was not corrected until 12 hrs later after I identified the problem
3rd. Since being here I overheard several staff members says patient were administered wrong MEDS, Meds were delivered to wrong patients
I went to nurses station upon approaching desk I started excuse is this the nurses station a older Asian decent rolled her eyes and looked up in the sky never answered  a staff member 2 seats over replied yes how can I help you
I'm suppose to have surgery here but I think I should run for my LIFE<//Text>< pics>

The ER and fast track are a joke! Iwent there in 2009 to the ER because of an injury I sustained in my personal area
Took 8 hours to see me and when I went more times for subsequent follow up treatment with fast track,  that was a joke! Plus security is very unprofessional because I heard one officer use the f bomb</Review>

The most stupidest and unprofessional hospital I ever been too. I have no idea what’s up with all the roommates stuff. I even ask them if my husband could get his own room because I nor my husband feels comfortable of sharing room with another person plus his roommate is so rude and privacy is what matter most too. Even if you want to stay overnight with your love one, they won’t allow it, try to kick you out and have you stay in the lobby, which the lobby isn’t a room by itself but with a bunch of  elevators, which make me felt even unsafe and uncomfortable. I mean, why should I leave my husband in a nurse’s care when the nurses can’t even do their job right. When you called for assistant, it took a nurse 10-15 mins to come to your serve, like c’mon, isn’t that why you go to school for and get your degree. What if a patient is dying, you’re just going to delay it and come whenever you want, I mean that is so unprofessional. I been to many other hospitals and this hospital is the only hospital I have bad experiences with. Why should I leave even if visitor hours are over? Many other hospitals have visitor hours and they still allow the patient’s love one to stay over night. Why should I leave my husband in someone’s hand since my husband and I can’t trust them and feel uncomfortable about it. I understand that the policy is to help keep everyone safe but at least give patients and their love ones some options and stop forcing them when they disagree. I thought patients’ thoughts and feelings is what matter to the hospital but I guess not; not when they only want money from patients. Without your patients, this hospital wouldn’t even be here today. I feel like this is just an ashamed and embarrassment for a hospital to treat their patients and the patients’ family like this. The nurses and doctors are pretty nice and convenience when coming to questions and helping you but the policy is what I don’t agree with. Hopefully this hospital change their policy and make it more convenience for the patients so he or she could at least feel like it’s home, feel comfortable staying here, feel like he or she have the privacy they wants, be able to feel relax so they could recover faster by having their family with them when they needed someone when the nurses aren’t around because some prefer their family assist them because of trust and comfortable.<//Text>

Mother put in a room and left alone with no blanket and no call lite. Asked to go to the bathroom on numerous occasions and no one ever came. Very poor care they think they are doing you a favor but you are paying there wages, there is nothing wrong with a little kindness and caring. We were treated like trash from the moment we came in we were directed to go to  another hospital but we opted for yours because that is where my mom had her stent put in big mistake and we won't make that one again. Your commercials about caring hospital is dodo it is so far from the truth! I<//Review>

Worst hospital my daughter has ever been to.  Followed ambulance to ER.  When I arrived they refused to let me see her.  They even told me she wasn't there.  Called several hours later, still told me she wasn't there even after my daughter called me from hospital and she had given consent to allow them to talk to me.  Had similar experience on prior occasion.  Will be avoiding CRMC like the plague in the future.<//Text>

my dad had fluids in his lungs (ammonia or something) and instead of having him on a wheelchair or a bed for him to lay down in, all the waiting seats were taken and my dad was on the floor sitting, and my dad wanted to lay on the floor because of the pain. they doctors told him he couldn't lay down either. when i tried to tske my dad out of the hospital, they called security on me. I had to get my brother to come by to help me get my dad out and into Clovis community hospital. was just a huge mess. i would give a negative star if I could. for doctors to yell at us saying we can't take my dad to a better hospital is very unprofessional.</Text>

<Review>This place is unprofessional. The nurses don't assist if a patient is in pain or bleeding, and the doctors are no where to be found. I feel bad for the people who have to go there..go to a hospital that really helps people, that's what a hospital is suppose to do, assist those in need.</Review><time>1546985458439< /time>< userid>

<Text>Worst hospital ever I though porterville hospital was bad this is way worst. First of all we arrived there early at the begining all fast but then all slow we would ask for pain medication for my husband and they would not give it to him they said he had to get admitted to the hospital and took like 5 hours up until my husband asked how much longer it was going to take they said about 3 days and they wouldn't even let me be inside the hospital with him and like I said no pain meds at all nor water or food since he did not eat all day  and he asked for water also and never received it so we decided to leave and they did not want to let him leave stating that if he did he was gonna die witch I thought they where the ones that were killing him there without food water and pain meds. As soon as he wanted to leave that's when nurses rushed to give him the meds but the doctor didn't let them since he wanted to leave and my husband stated to the doctor that I was there outside and they didn't let me go in so he wanted to let me go in since he wanted to leave. So overall we spent 12 whole hours in there no medicine was ever given to him and to top it off the nurse ripped of the iv off of his hand roughly and we left from there with my husband in much more pain than what he arrived there all because of the negligence of the nurses and doctors at that hospital never will I ever take him or any of my kids or myself to that hospital rather go elsewhere  if I could I would rate negative stars but unfortunately I can't<//Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Worse than poor rating... Was in ER for horrible pain from neuropathy type pain. Staff member made the comment," Oh look, you get some pills... Now you can go sell them to your friends and they're good ones too!"

Left ER because of the poor treatment and ended up having to go back. This time the DR says, "You left and came back. You're making my work harder..."

Will go to Clovis Community instead in the future.<//Text>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>Recently I was transported by ambulance to the emergency room at this hospital. So this review is for that experience.

I had been trying to pass a kidney stone for 4 days. On day 4 (after basically being ignored by the local walk-in clinic),and  because of excruciating pain I had to call an ambulance to transport me to the ER at Community Regional Medical Center.

I was brought in, put into a small cubicle in the green zone, and over the next 7 hours seen, probed, and examined by at least three doctors, 2 nurses, and 1 medical student. After about the first 2 hours I was given something for the pain. Finally – some relief. Two ultrasounds at bedside, and one in the proper ultrasound facility later, I'm visited by my attending physician who tells me I would released soon. I'm given a referral to visit an on-campus lab, and the on-campus urology clinic in 2-3 days.

Three days later, still in lots of pain, I drive to the lab and clinic. Both tell me, that they cannot see me. Their reasoning – these on-campus facilities are for Medi-Cal and not those with private insurance like me. Apparently, the ER doctor did not check for my insurance status before referring me to these places. Fortunately, one of the receptionists at the urology clinic gives me the number for the local Urology Associates of California office, and after a visit in person, and lots of pleading, I get an appointment with a real urologist.

I'm now scheduled for out-patient surgery, 15 days in to this horrible experience with no real help from any of the preceding medical providers.

My experience at CRMC-ER did not provide any real positive results for me. I'm disappointed with lack of care or follow-up from this facility.</Text>< Pictures>

They have one of the worst nurses in the front. Her name is Mai Vang Bad additute very rude
Ask to be discharge and she gave me an additute. Had an iv on me call my name and I didn’t even had a chance to sit when she was already pulling the tape of my skin. Didn’t even gave me the chance to sit. I knew the risk of me choosing to get discharge! She continue with her additute and said “ you take full responsibility if you leave chances are you could die” I also Was observing how she treated patient she gave them additute as well and show no care ness. They should have nurses who won’t treat the patient wrong it’s a facility we’re patience  go in bc their sick.

Kicking patients out before they are ready for discharge. Poor follow up care. Not enough socal workers.

I went to pick up my grand daughter and great daughter from the neo niç unit to go home May 29th. We were notified that morning that my great grand daughter was being released, while waiting i noticed that we didnt have enough clothes for the baby to go home in. I ask the nurses if we could take one of the blankets to put in her car seat to keep her head from rolling, i was told no that we could not take hosital equipment this was a very old overly washed blanket. We had to take the tshirt off of the baby because we couldnt take that either. I had bought somethings and i left in the car so i had to put unwashed clothes on this new baby. I was a little bit shocked seeing that this baby was only 4lbs 4 oz and then it hit me the feeling that i got was the reminder of who our president was. The nurse was very calis and cold. A younger more humain nurse said she would go look for some left over clothing. My grandchild is a defensless week old baby. Just because we have a racist for a president this doesnt mean we have to follow his lead. I would not suggest new black mothers have your babys at CRMC<//Review>

So unethical unprofessional and truly not upholding the Drs oath to preserve and protect life rather than disregard as a piece of trash! Patient is being tossed out now....4-4-18 at 12:20 AM and will now sit in er waiting room infecting hundreds as patient was taken in by ambulance from another city and has to find a way back home.

How is his family supposed to know where he is amd how he is doing when your staff constantly loses records. I sit here and I'm scared he is lying there in pain without the meds he needs. I seriously doubt im the care he may or may not be currently receiving. Stay away from this hospital at all costs!. I called again and y'all still don't him in your system. Fess up to it.

I have had reasons both to love this hospital system dearly and to become severely disappointed.  Whatever CMC did wrong, they gave me the privilege of working for them for almost 3 1/2 years, and I loved my coworkers and management dearly.  Until I was fired, I never had an enemy.  However, I do believe that the disciplinary actions and my firing were highly unethical, that they were not a result of unprofessional communication as claimed, and that many in management were unethical in attempting to silence me about some issues in ethics both prior and following my firing.  I have also felt the same way about the dismissal or treatment of other employees.

Regardless, I do wish CMC success in improving in areas where it is weak while retaining excellence those areas where it is strong.</review>

<Review>All I have to say is that this hospital, along with several others, need to be investigated and exposed for the fraud that they are committing by not rendering services that they are charging insurance company's for and wasting the patients time (hours upon hours of waiting) just to have little to nothing done and then discharged or kicked out of the hospital. This should be investigated and aired on the news, seriously!< /Review>< Date>

CRMC in Fresno is supposedly a "tier 1", premier hospital in California's San Joaquin Valley. Not exactly sure how this is determined, but I'm guessing there is some shady exchange of cash for the title. That being said, below is a pros/cons list from a custome... er, patient.

Pros:
-Registered Nurses (RNs) and Patient Care Assistants (PCAs). These folks take on a VAST majority of the workload. In my experience, at least 4 out of 5 of them clearly enjoy helping people. Most of them work 12hr+ shifts and I have yet to hear them complain, regardless of often being understaffed and greatly underpaid.

-Free WiFi. (when it works)

Cons:
-Waiting Times. In my experience, it has taken 3 days of laying on a gurney in a hallway before getting moved to a room. It's not horrible, as there are the wonderful aforementioned RNs to tend to your ailments, but it is uncomfortable to say the least and you will undoubtedly be sore rounding mid second day.

-Cafeteria Staff. The folks working in the lobby cafeteria are some of the rudest and least helpful staff onsite. Specifically one of the morning cashiers (an elderly, Asian lady who immediately threw my food in the rubbish bin when I asked her if I could step aside to get the proper change together) Another instance, I asked a server a question about one of the items at the hot food station and was told "it's self serve!" as she turned and walked away.

-Blue Sky Dining. This is the patient in room dining department at CRMC. They have two "specials" for each meal and an additional selection of options with each meal. If you get your meal as ordered, consider yourself very lucky. I ordered a mushroom omelet and side of fruit, but was given pancakes and turkey sausage. Any deviations from their "specials" will result in unwanted results.
(on a side note, you can always have food delivered by an outside restaurant, in lieu of the hospital options)

-Communication. There doesn't seem to be much communication, if any, between departments or sometimes even within the same department. Be prepared to answer the same questions two or three times a day for the duration of your stay. It gets irritating quickly.

-Noise/Lack of sleep. Unless you have a contagious disease you will have a roommate. This could range from someone who was in some some sort of accident and sleeps most of the time to a violent junkie in handcuffs who screams and yells all day and all night.

Summary: CRMC Fresno should be able to get the job done, but if you have other options look into them. Research, research, research.

They don't notify his wife or his mother (he has asked numerous times for them to call his mom and let her know what is going on) of anything that is going on.  They removed 2 of his toes and didn't notify anyone, they moved him across the street to a facility for supposed physical therapy since they never did anything while he was in the hospital and never notified anyone they just moved him.  They never treat him and get him well they just do the bare minimum and ship him out.  They know that he has a very limited memory and can't see very well but the push paperwork in front of him and have him sign them.  He has no idea of what he is signing.  They were supposed to put him on a heart transplant list and never followed through with that....I would really like to know who to complain to because we can't seem to get any help.  They call us on any given day and say he is being released that day and to come and get him.  We live out of town at least 1 1/2 hours away and we are expected to drop everything to come and get him.  They have called us and told us that they are sending a man who can't see or walk very well home on amtrak all by himself and instead send him on a bus and don't let us know, they have sent him home in a Taxi and never notified us he just showed up.  They try to send him home without getting a home nurse program set up....this is just disgusting.  If I could post this and not give them any stars I would.  They don't deserve any.<//text></record>

One reason you should go anywhere else

Locked down ER on a daily basis.

That means if you have a family member waiting with you and they go on lockdown because they have too many people in the ER your family member must go wait in a completely separate building.
This means you will sit alone (sick or in pain?) for a very extended long wait time and once you do get a room in back or bed in the hallway or like I got a chair that barely reclines, your family member still cannot come back and stay with you. I can't speak for everyone with chronic illness but I know that when I'm going through it there's nothing I need more than my family support so it's worth it to me to go anywhere else.
Funny I find very few reviews that mention this lockdown but it upsets the majority of the ER when it happens. Especially the non-english speakers that don't understand they must leave their family member sick.
Think about that.........

Don't let community's response below fool you. I sent my number and No one ever contacted me. Not that I'm surprised.
I have had such a great experience recently at Saint Agnas Hospital, care with compassion and effectiveness. I highly recommend Saint Agnes.<//review>

< review>
For the most part my experiences at this hospital have been of high quality service. this hospital deals with a high proportion of  an underserved community, and is an inner-city hospital so all that need to be taken in to consideration. Unlike St Agnes which can pick and chose who it take CVMC can not. The ER for all its down falls is massive and has taken care of me many times. The peters Unit is Amazing,, and when I had my stroke 2 years ago the were there for me. The nurses at the Hospital are wodrefullas are all the staff I have encountered.<//review>

Went in at 7:00 p.m on Friday night my ankle was cut down to the muscle and it was about two to three inches wide and length was the same just wanted some stitches.  Got evaluated at 12:30 p.m. than sent to wait again.  At 1:00 a.m. sent to another waiting area and waited another hour or so still nothing.  Asked when I will be seen was told not for another 5 or 6 hours.  They kept saying it would be okay and they could still stitch up.  Got fed up and went to Saint Agnes got seen in about 1 hour was told it was to late and could not stitch up cleaned it up and wrapped was told to watch it and keep it clean.  Thanks alot Community.< /Review>

<Text>I have never ever been to such a ghetto hospital. I feel like I'm in a 3rd world country. When you first come in the ER feels like you're entering a prison, the way they check you. You will wait here all day with an unsympathetic staff that is absolutely no help.  My son had a surgery scheduled and were told to come in at 8:50. It's currently 12:07 and he has not had his surgery yet. I asked the nurse and she answered " yeah it's going to be another hour or so " and walked away.  They don't care about you, only money. We're are nothing but numbers.< /Text>< pictures>

Went to the ER with a broken ankle. Went through seven stages of staff. The entire experience was in public. I knew what was happening with at least twenty other patients during my treatment and they knew what was happening with me. I felt like a cow being rounded up. It was extremely humiliating. A tech finally came to cast my leg in the hallway when I insisted on a room he took me for a spin in the back halls of the ER which was full of sick people. There was not an inch of hallway wall space that did not have a bed on it. If you have a choice go somewhere hell anywhere else.<//review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>Went here in an ambulance Jan. 2016 going into cardiac arrest several times. Review is written as a 25 year old who just got a pacemaker. Unfortunately, it was hard to get information out of ER staff as to what happened to me, they gave me terms like "your pulse fell out". The day staff did a decent job of checking up on me and giving me a sense of security. The night staff however ignored my requests to leave the light on and curtain open; there is no way I could have slept with the adrenaline IV drip or the fear of the defibrillator machine hitting me again and the staff trying to make me sleep was the worst possible thing. I've noticed in other reviews that it seems like the ER staff doesn't care... Unfortunately I've been in/around this job earlier in my life, and if you don't disconnect constantly (especially in red zone and ICU!) you'll never survive the inner demons, so I understand. It's not that you're just a paycheck, it's more that you're a potential death that could haunt them. BEHIND THE SCENES I discovered later that an entire panel of doctors that I saw personally once if at all was on my case. They diagnosed me with something that wouldn't have been caught for YEARS even with my primary doctor had I not been in the ER, because it was very rare for someone 25.

Overall, I've been in a lot of ERs and hospitals, especially as my mom was dying, and they were mostly in Texas. I've timed ERs, and 14 hours is a typical time to get discharged (from time being admitted) for nothing being wrong at all. This ER not only had me diagnosed, but had a pacemaker put inside me in 22 hours. I know a lot of people may not understand the significance of that, but let me inform you that getting a pacemaker put in normally requires being put on a surgery waitlist for 1-2 months.< /text>< pics>

<Text>I've spent over 13 hours here waiting to get an MRI. They're system is not effective. They wouldn't allow a family member to see thr doctor with me despite me having memory problems. Yet when I finally did get into a room i was alone and had two visitor chairs. The hospital really needs to work on providing their patients with better care. It's like thr DMV of hospitals. Plus they dont provide you with water or blankets<//Text>< pictures>

1) Upon arrival, I filled out all necessary paperwork at the receptionist desk and requested for a wheel chair and the receptionist (Ms. Kham) replied "Those are RARE around here." Then directed us to the patient waiting area. - 30 mins

2) After my Wife provided a Urine sample, the doctor stated "Just leave it by that desk and I'll get it later." In which we did. - 30 mins

3) After waiting for an hour they finally called us in for an IV and medication. We noticed the abundance of patients lined up along the hallway walls (Not enough rooms). Then Dr. Blake, B. arrived and asked a series of questions. Dr. Blake had visible tattoos on both forearms to include one on his chest. As a professional, I believe first impression goes a very long way.

4) Dr. Blake is straight up rude. He didn't finish wiping the gel off the ultrasound handle after conducting a kidney ultrasound, he was very arrogant with his tone of voice, he fussed a one of the nurses because she couldn't proved a pelvic bed. Then he stated to me in a rude tone " You need to leave when we conduct the pelvic test." as he opened the door.

5) Upon completion, they shuttled us like cattle to the financial counselor (Obviously because they want money. I shook my hand out to greet her and she immediately turned away and operated her computer.

I have been to multiple medical facilities and this one is by far the worst. The staff are very unprofessional, facility is not very clean, no amenities, and I felt like I was in Jail due to the weapon screening upon entrance and security always escorting patients.

I would rate this -5 stars if possible.</review>

I wouldn't even give each a star but BE AWARE!!!! My husband was in a severe accident, they didn't give antibiotics, didn't wash there hands before changing his dressing, not one nurse knew anything about his condition, they used him as a ginea pig without his concent(pt violation), refused to give him copies of his chart x-rays etc ( it's California state law that a pt has a right to a copy of his/her chart notes everything,nurse and SOCAIL worker laugh over your situations, trying to keep the pts there for as long as they can if they know there is money coming from you. BE AWARE DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL UNLESS YOUR WANTING YOUR RIGHTS VIOLATED, I SAY THIS BECAUSE MY HUSBAND HAD ABOUT 12 CALIFORNIA LAWS VIOLATED IN 72 HOURS AND IF THE SITUATION WASN'T BAD ENOUGH MY LAWYERS WILL BE CONTACTING THEM!!!!<//Review>

Unprofessional, cold hearted, dirty and very disorganized.<//Text>< pics>

Worst hospital ever. Thanks for putting me in a corner to deal with my chronic anixitey by myself I was drenched in sweat and freezing I was scared you all could see it when I came in the abulance. You have no compassion at all. If I could give you no stars I would😥😥<//Text>

Absolutely the worst place to go. Very unorganized and rude. Caught a Doctor making gagging noises and laughing at a patient while he was walking out. Please don't take your love ones here. Don't trust this hospital with their life.<//Review>

<response>None<//response><review>My daughter was admitted from a car accident, she suffered an 80ft fall off a cliff…The emergency room was good …however the majority of staff on trauma 1 were just horrible! Not only did the leave her IV in from the paramedics until I complained for 3 days but they did not know what they were doing …They did not bathe her until I asked a nurses aid many times I finally got an aid that cared and she saw how miserable my daughter was with glass shards still in her skin…They starved her for 3 days as she was throwing up from pain meds finally we convinced a staff member to give her a cracker and anti nausea meds which stopped her vomiting…The entire time I had to "suggest" what to do… Bother the staff to get test result such as a cat scan for 3 full days so my child could eat and so I would know she had no internal injuries… The day staff and the night staff did not know what the other was doing…They were constantly giving me excuses that they did not know! Well, isn't that what charts are for? …Then when I asked for a person I could complain to  I was given he main # and told by a very RUDE supervisor that is all she could give me! Oh and one more horrible issue …They told me my daughter would not be released for at least 24 hours come to find out they took her lunch and kicked her out of her room! Put her in a hall bed because "they needed beds" yet over 50 beds were empty when I arrived!!!! Shameful!!!!!</review>< Date>

If i could give them no stars i would. My wife was seeing by the medical staff for 7 out of the 9 months that she was pregnant. My wife needed to get her medical records transferred to our new doctor from all the blood work she had done and everything and they told her that they only have the last two months of documentation of her being seeing there. The medical record clerk was giving her attitude and saying theres no records of her being here for that long and theres nothing they can do. and when she called the records supervisors and left 3 messeges they will not return her calls. Im beyond furious with how this "hospital" is ran and will not be going back!!! They are lucky my wife does not want me going in there or else they would have a piece of my mind!!</review>

<text>Horrible experience, staff doesn't help unless you be rude...my son has acute lymphocytic luekemia and sits in pain for hours on end with no help. Regardless of how many times we call for help they don't, it takes hours for a dr or nurse. There obviously either under educated or under staffed. But they really need to get it together. It's really sad the lack of compassion they have here.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp><Gmap_id>0x80945e0a451bde4b:0xe6319ba89de3ea4d</Gmap_id></record>

I went to CRMC with what I knew was bronchitis. They did give me a nebulizer treatment and some inhalers, which only helped with the weezing and none of the other bronchitis symptoms. I've had bronchitis before and it can be horribly debilitating, especially the longer it goes untreated. The doctors claimed that they weren't going to give me antibiotics because of supposed side effects. They wouldn't even prescribe me anything for the cough. I had to spend money out of pocket for cold and flu medications which did not work. The coughing was so frequent that I couldn't sleep or eat. I have had surgery on my head and the constant coughing was causing problems with that too. I had to basically drink Dayquil and Nyquil to even be able to stand up right. I was in the process of moving too which I had to do with bronchitis, pneumonia, and no medication on a hot day in Fresno. That's right CRMC missed the pneumonia even after taking x-rays of my chest and me going to the emergency room. After arriving in Monterey, I immediately went to the emergency room and they found the pneumonia and bronchitis right away, and immediately prescribed me a Z-pack (antibiotics) and an rx for the cough that gave me immediate relief. Oh, did I forget to mention that the nurse refused to look at the list of pharmacies right in front of her? Of course I couldn't remember the street that my pharmacy was on, I had very little sleep, very little food, and no medication for days. She asked if I was homeless since I didn't know the street name! What the hell does that have to with how you treat or address people?!</review>

Worst hospital in history.
Ambulance took me in for breathing issues, and after 8 hours of tests, being insulted by the staff, and getting fluids, I still never got my breathing issues addressed, but somehow got discharged.
The blood work and IV left the most terrible painful bruises today.
Save yourself the trouble, go to Selma or Madera. Clovis is just as bad.< /Text>

Why do the staff starve the patients here at this hospital ? Won't allow them to drink or eat for over 24 hour some even go with out food or water for more then 24 hour !!! With out food or water it makes the patients more weak to fight their sickness !!
Just a heads up on discharging from the hospital it takes almost a full day just to be release not sure what the doctor is doing, the faster they discharge a patient the more patient and money they can make, free up some beds for the sick<//review>

<rate>1</rate><text>The care and the service is a bad experience. The doctors are rude. They left my father in the ER for like 3 days without giving him a room. He wasn't ready to be discharged. In addition, my father had a stroke and we didn't have everything we needed to care for him at home and they still forced us and kept calling us to take him home. My family was stressed out because we didn't have the appropriate equipment before discharge. I guess the hospital cares about the money.

(Translated by Google) Hi all.

Today I share or experience that I had in the community hospital in Fresno, I arrived at the hospital really for an emergency, not for any pain and the truth had the best experience in it, hospitality and the attention of all the staff since I stepped on the front door , I was treated and reviewed according to the hospital protocols with the best attention and explaining everything that happened at all times despite this covid-19 pandemic and I thank the entire team of medical nurses and cleaning staff who are always working It is hard to attend to all the staff as we arrive, many people despair because they are treated and better choose to leave, in my experience if we really go to the hospital for an emergency it is to wait for them to attend us and tell the doctor or specialist that it is What do they suggest in my case? They suggested an operation and asking me if I agreed? And of course I put myself in their hands and as I mentioned it was a study and medication process to proceed with the operation and I would like us to be aware in this covid-19 situation that if we go to the hospital it is really for an emergency and wait for us Attend and doctors are sure of the procedure to follow and not go and waste their time later to remove the hoses and go home or not wait because they are desperate that we would like to be treated as our head doctor, in the ER
They are working hard to attend to patients who are already in the preparation room, believe me, I never look at doctors or nurses without taking care of anything, all of them working very hard with patients even in the country, with medicine to the bena and always working hard all the staff until Los cleaning (AGAMOS CONSIENSIA) And if it is because of a pain and you have your head doctor, wait for your doctor to attend you and do not waste time with the doctors and nurses and treat the staff with respect, let's not be rude, they are too busy and with a lot of stress and concern to save lives and yet they behave kind and understandable with all the passers-by and if they feel that someone is not treating them as they should, they have the right to be heard, seek to be heard, thank you very much to all The team that helped me and also the people who donate to hospitals, we must not forget about them. Thank you. Thank you very much.

Hola a todos.

Hoy comparto ni experiensia que tube en el hospital community en fresno, llegue al hospital realmente por emergencia,  no por un dolor cualquiera y la verdad tube la mejor experiensia en el,  hospitalidad y la atencion de todo el personal desde que pise la puerta de entrada, me atendieron y revisaron conforme a Los protocolos del hospital con la mejor atencion y explicandome todo lo que susedia en todo momento apesar de esta pandemia del covid-19 y le agradesco a todo el equipo de medicos enfermeros y personal de limpieza que siempre estan trabajando duro para atender a todo el personal conforme vamos llegando, muchas personas se deseperan por que Los atiendan y mejor optan por irse, en mi experiensia si realmente vamos al hospital por emergencia es para esperar a que nos atiendan y diga el doctor o especialista que es lo que sujieren en mi caso sujirieron una operacion y preguntandome si estaba de acuerdo? y claro que me puse en sus manos y como comente fue un proseso de estudios y medicasion para proseder a la operacion y quisiera que isieramos consiensia en esta situacion de covid-19 de que si vamos al hospital sea realmente por emergencia y esperar a que nos atiendan y medicos esten seguros de el prosedimiento a seguir y no ir y aserles perder el tiempo para despues quitarse las mangueras y irse a casa o no esperar por que estan desesperados que quisieramos que nos atendieron como nuestro doctor de cabeza, en URGENCIA
estan trabajando duro para atender a pasientes que estan ya en sala de preparasion creanme que nunca mire a doctores o enfermeros sin estar asiendo nada todos trabajando muy duro con pasientes hasta en el pasiyo con medicamento a la bena y siempre trabajando duro todo el personal hasta Los de limpieza (AGAMOS  CONSIENSIA) Y si es por un dolor y tienen a su doctor de cabezera esperen a su doctor a que Los atienda y no agamos perder el tiempo a Los doctores y enfermeros y tratemos al personal con respeto no seamos groseros eyos estan demasiado ocupados y con mucho estres y preocupasion por salvar vidas y aun asi se portan amables y comprensibles con todos los pasientes y si sienten que alguien no Los esta tratando como se debe tienen el derecho de ser escuchados busquen ser escuchados, muchas Gracias de corazon a todo el equipo que me ayudo y tambien a las personas que asen Donasiones a hospitales no hay que olvidarnos de eyos Gracias muchas Gracias.< /text>

<review>Brought in my new truck that had a minor accident.  They put all factory parts back and it looks as good as new.  They did it quickly and with great communication.  I would highly recommend.< /review><Rate>5<//Rate><Gmap_id>0x808416162fc80c93:0x8e6587cfa86da66c<//Gmap_id>< Pictures>

We live in a world where, so often, our expectations are tamped down do to the endless complexities that we run into and so it was amazing to find that G & C has found a way to coordinate every single need that a customer like me would have when an autobody repair needs to happen. First, their staff are all skilled and very nice and the car came out perfect. Second, their integration with my insurance company was seamless and took away any insurance company problems I might encounter.  Third , my Hertz rental car was there waiting for me when I dropped my car off for repairs... Couldn't have asked for a better experience.....< /review>

Friendly and knowledgeable staff kept me updated at all times with any repairs, delays, and general information. They were helpful in showing me pictures of service, explaining everything, and making the coordination between an auto body shop, insurance company, and rental car company a very smooth and painless experience. Dan and Ali were the staff I interacted with mostly and were very helpful.< /text>

i had a terrific experience with Mitch. he was very accommodating and worked with me through my insurance after someone backed into my car. the shop did a perfect job repairing and re-painting my bumper. the color was a perfect match. Mitch even delivered my car to a family members house since i couldn’t make it back in time before they closed. it was sparkling clean! hopefully i won’t need exterior repairs in the future, but if i do i’d definitely return!<//text>

A truly great experience from start to finish. The staff( Mitch) was very attentive to our repair. We were constantly updated throughout the process. I asked for a "showroom finish" repair on my car, and that is exactly what I got.<//Text>

I was very impressed at how friendly and helpful they were.
I was also amazed at how they took it upon themselves to touch up another area that was not part of the original damage I had taken it in for and how fast they were at returning the vehicle back to me. I would definitely recommend G&C to anyone looking for car repair!<//Text>

Well I wasn’t going to say anything, but since G and C keeps asking us to post a review, I will. They took twice as long as the estimated time to complete repairs. When my wife finally was able to come get her car, she was informed that one of their techs hit it in their parking lot and repairs would have to be re done. 🤦🏻‍♂️ Will rethink our body shop choice next time.<//text>

The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  This was my second experience with G&C and even through this was for minor repairs they kept me updated through the repair process. They worked directly with my insurance.  Never fun to have to deal with an accident but everything  went smoothly.<//text>

It seems everything worked out really well.
I appreciate Daniel being willing to drop off my car to my house when finished, and deal with the return of my rental vehicle.  Thanks.  Nick<//Text>

These guys are awesome.  I went there once for some paint touch ups and they helped me out for free.  They were so nice I took my car back when someone love tapped me on the freeway.  Great job and super nice.  I highly recommend them.< /Text>

Thank you so much for the outstanding customer service and for fixing my car!  I had a fender bender and I had to travel out of state for work the next week.... perfect timing, eh?? I really wanted my car to be repaired when I was gone, since I wasn't going to need it.   I had my car dropped off before I left, and picked up when I got home a few days later.  Easy peasy!  Jeff worked with my schedule, communicated with me while I was out of state about my car, and it looked perfect when I came back.  Also, it was clean- inside and out!  Yeah me!  I will recommend G & C to anyone.  I never write reviews... but  for this, I made an exception. :-)  THANK YOU!<//text>

<Text>Had a great experience with G&C Autobody. One of our cars was in a minor accident and needed some body work. G&C handled the insurance paperwork and kept us in the loop via telephone the whole way. The work they did was great and we were really pleased with the outcome. The car looks as good as new.< /Text>< Name>

< review>
Lucky me! I (knock on wood!) have only had this one experience with an auto body shop in all my years of driving. When my business was all done with C&G, I could not help but wonder "what was all the fuss that people make about dealing with body shops and insurance?"  Truly competent, fast, polite and professional.  Hope I don't have someone back into me again, but if I do, C&G is where I will head.   Thanks folks.</review>

<text>I highly recommend G&C Autobody in Windsor, CA.  I have been there three times, ranging from some significant body work to small fender-bender dings in a parking lot.  Each time they were very professional, courteous, and kept me in the loop as to what was going on.  Since each of those times I was not liable for the accidents, they were able to use the other party's insurance information to pay for the work without any issues or hassle.  They even provided me with a loaner car so I could commute to work.< /text>< time>

<Review>A good experience from start to finish.  They did an excellent job, you could never tell there was a deep scratch along the fender of my car.  It was done quickly and when I had some trouble going to pick it up they delivered it to me and I live 45 minutes away!< /Review><GmapID>0x808416162fc80c93:0x8e6587cfa86da66c< /GmapID><Time>1404366064837<//Time><response>None</response><user>108669939325703767581< /user><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Rate>5</Rate></record></dataset><record>

Great customer service.In house anyway. . .Dislike is their delivery, door dash. They need to start delivering themselves.  60% of the time they don't deliver my entire order, or they "can't find" my address an I have to meet them somewhere, or they just give our order to the neighbors.</text>

Not fond of the area in which this Little Caesars is located, but I like their cheap pizza. Their extra most bestest thin crust pepperoni pizza if really good.</Text>

< review>
I waited for 15 minutes to order. Then 2 puzzas and 4 jalepeno cheese dip.  Over 35 bucks.  I waited 25 minutes.  They didnt get my pizza order correct at all.  The worst experience Ive ever had with any of the Little Ceasars Puzza.  The worst.  I will never go back to the ace again.  Ever.  I think I should get a total refund sent to me plus, a free redo of my order at a different locatiin.  I will make sure to tell my entire social media family and friends ablut this horrific experience.  That way my family. Of cousins etc which equal 500 will stay away from S K Street, Tulare, CA .  Ripped off by the price, quality of preparation, Time lost" wrong order ,,... The Worst.</review>

Never order for delivery. They steal your money.The delivery guy only delivery part of my order and it was cold. When I called the store I was told to call customer service. When I call customer service for a refund they say it would take up to 10 business days and I have to wait for someone to contact me by email. I’m pretty sure I’m not gonna see my money. Never ordering from Little Cesar again.< /text>

< Review>
Ordered a deep dish at 830.  Was told to wait fifteen minutes. I wait 20 minutes to give them some time as it was busy. When I come in to collect my order they tell me they HADNT EVEN BEGAN TO COOK MY PIZZA.  Was told to wait an additional ten minutes.  May seem minor but at 9 at night on a Sunday it’s ridiculous. Was given a free soda for the mistake but still annoyed<//Review>

Horrible customer service! Every time I go into this particular little Caesars I regret it. Each time I say never again but this time I mean it, I wanted to use the pizza portal so I wouldn’t have to deal with the people who work there because they are always slow and do not do what is advertised. So I get there my pizza portal is empty, I have to ask for each part of my order (the pizza, breadsticks, and wings) but I forgot to ask for the wings, that I shouldn’t have to of asked for in the first place, and now I’ve spent money for something I didn’t even get. I don’t know why you would advertise the pizza portal if you don’t use it. I’ll never go to this store again.<//Text>

Every time we have ordered pizza at this location the crust is super uneven. One side looks like we ordered deep dish and the other side looks like we ordered thin crust.</Review>

<date>1551777527771<//date><Rating>3</Rating><text>Little Caesars is that "hit and miss" more times then none you know what you're getting into when you're deciding to get Little Caesars then deciding to spend twice as much at a regular pizza place. Depending on what location you decide to go to in town will effect on how your pizza looks. My spouse and I used to go to the drive thru one we have in town due to convenience and it's not as crowded as the one in Mary's Vineyard, yes.. you heard me right.. This place actually gets crowded. But I can see why, pizza is affordable and you can by in bulk to feed many. Plus the overall flavor isn't bad. I feel like this kind of pizza is really good if someone brings it to you rather then you actually paying for it yourself. It's the saying "free food is good food", that definitely applies here. The deep dish pizzas are really good! But super greasy so bring some extra napkins with you. On a different note: the Pizza Portal needs to be fixed. The premise is great! Walk up, put the number they provided you with in the kiosk, grab your stuff and go. But it's hard to do when they don't actually use the kiosk so when you show up, no pizza in the kiosk, so you have to wait in line now for something you tried to get done through this new and faster invention.

Placed an order online, for quick and easy service. Pizza was not available as system wasn't working. However they had a pizza already ready for the next customer. Good tasting for the price, friendly service.</review>

Lady on the phone was rude and also believed that we were done with our order when we barely said one part of our order. It's only done when we say "that's all."

The people around the outside that loiter make all of us customers uncomfortable as well...

They ALSO messed up our order! I honestly prefer the Porterville Little Caesars even though I tend to shy away from that town. At least they're nicer.< /Text>

I love the pizza here. Unfortunately it is VERY small and there isn't much room to wait. So when it's busy, prepare to stand shoulder to shoulder with someone else. There are also always homeless people waiting outside asking for money or pizza.< /review>

The women working there tgis morning where rude as can be. They open at 10 i went at 1110 and they didn't have any pizza's ready. They had a new employee and another chick was treating her all bad. Disappointed this place is getting worse evertime. To end thing they didnt cut my pizza.< /review>

<Review>Not very much parking and luckily i got out before a rush otherwise im not sure how i would have gotten out. The pizza was pretty good for being little ceasers and only had to wait 10 min since we got sausage. though one very big issue was the homeless guy sitting right outside the door. Could be a decent place but really gotta deal with the homeless.<//Review>< pics>

The pizza is good i sometimes go there not all the time but what i dont like is theres always a homeless person outside the door asking for money or like tonight when i went there was a guy holding the door letting people in an out and getting money for doing that.  Yeah i get u were being nice getting the door for people but theres no need for getting money to do that too when jobs are available.< /text>

< Review>
I took my daughter and her cousin to get a hot N ready well it was hot just not READY.The dough was not cooked all the way and I called to tell them this and the woman apologized and said I could come get another pizza not to worry about bringing the other pizza back so a homeless man asked for it si I gave I to I'm and went to get the other one but after I drove all the way back down there they absolutely refused to replace it other wise I wouldn't have gave it away I wold have cooked it the rest the way even though no one should got that's the whole reason behind"FST FOOD"< /Review>

I call ahead and they used to be good with orders but lately they always tell me they "accidentally" gave it to another customer or lie about it saying "oh I must have put it in as something else"< /Text>

Pizza and service are always good. But would like the problem of the homeless addressed.  They are always standing outside and where they sit and park their bikes it is also extremely dirty.<//review>

Worst service ever. I waiting in line for 23 min only to have to wait an additional 10 min for a cheese pizza. Apparently those arent hot-n-ready, which has never happened to me at another little caesars. The store seemed like it was either under staffed dramaticly or they did not know how to handle a dinner rush. The cash register was even under prepared as the cashier did not have sufficient change and the store itself was low apparently.  The management at this store really needs to be looked at<//text>

The pizza isn't to bad if you call & order over the phone but don't count on getting the full order (even if you called & your order take's 30 minutes, it's never done when they say it'll be done, nor is the whole order ready or done right!) The service is slow & isn't good at all, the employees roll there eye's & get rude if there was a mistake & you bring it to there attention. They close hour's earlier then there suppose to (for example tonight at 7:25pm, 3 vehicle's pulled up & they locked the doors & weren't letting anyone in at all) this kind of rudeness & bad behavior from employees isn't good for business & shouldn't be allowed at all! I'll be taking my business & money else where for now on!</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>I have nothing against less fortunate people and I wish I could help them, but having them hang out at the 🍕 place when you're trying to buy food makes it hard for some people including myself. It makes me feel bad that I don't always give them something on my way out. I don't always have to give out food or 💰. They should not be allowed to hang out there at any time during business hours unless they are going in and out to buy food. It doesn't help the business.</Text><response>None<//response><user>102513458522506901623< /user></record>

(Translated by Google) The best thing about this place is the price and how fast. The pizzas of pepperoni have them ready at the moment. The wings are rich. It is fast, simple and easy to carry.
