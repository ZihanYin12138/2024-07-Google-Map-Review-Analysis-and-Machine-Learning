Manny Yesenia Jessica I think that's their names secretaries checks us in checks us out appointments answers the phone Exedra they are great patient and kind always its amazing. One time I was in there and said because I didn't eat enough when I took my meds I was sick and the girl gave me a breakfast sandwich should definitely be recognized for their hard work and pleasantness so thank you to my doctor and thank you to everyone that makes everything a pleasant experience including the lab techs both of those ladies are sweet as hell too<//Review>

The dr assigned to me has been patient with me , there was some lack of communication but a third party ( victor ) was involved in which made the communication slightly better.  I like my dr.  I like the environment.<//Text>

<Text>I never do reviews, but I was so mad I had to write this.
I made an appointment at 8:30 waited until 11:30 asked a few times when I was going to be seen they kept giving me the run around.All I needed were test results, I asked the nurse for the results and they would give them to me. I suggest you show up at 4:45pm no matter what time you make an appointment. I'm sure they want to go home to!
Don't go here worse doctors office iv ever been to!< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80ea43dcff06f2a5:0xbdbf9377d6294d36<//Gmap_id>< Time>

< Review>
These Physicians are professional, and show a parent concern and consideration for each patient. I was pleasantly surprised, at my first visit to find that each doctor in this group with whom I had appointments had coordinated with each other so that they all were on the same page regarding my care. Excellent, excellent, excellent!</Review>

<review>Dr. Softa offer specialized care and facility. Their main concern is not only to take care of the patient during the disease, but also provide moral and emotional support.  A big thanks for them for their services.<//review>< Name>

Our experience with this office was horrible. Dr. Arun Softa and providers in his office came highly recommended by another provider who is part of Dignity health.  We were seen by him the first time but all he did was give us a lab slip. The second time around we saw the Nurse Practitioner and she spent more time looking at her cell phones for symptoms than anything else. We were there 2 more times and boy do we regret it. We ended up walking out of the office. We asked to see Dr. Softa the last time we were there and the NP was the one in the room. She kept repeating herself and obviously did not read any of the notes on our previous visits.  She was clueless as to what study and labs she had ordered. This was a very disappointing experience and we will not be returning. Aside from being clueless, she was always in a hurry and seemed so bothered when questions were asked. It's unfortunate this office comes so highly recommended.< /Review>

<Review>I have been going here for a while, and the staff is very nice. I have had a couple of negative experiences, one being a time that I came in for a scheduled appointment and they had neglected to inform me that my doctor no longer worked there and that I wasn't even a patient in their books anymore. They did correct it and I started seeing a nurse practitioner, whom I could not understand very well and who didn't seem to understand me, either. I came to an appt with her, and after waiting 45 minutes, they called me up and said "We are so sorry, but she is on vacation." Again, they had neglected to tell me. I finally changed to Dr Ambika Softa, and had a good first appt with her (just be prepared to wait a long time for her, as she is very busy.)< /Review></record>

I get that they raise money for others but used furniture should be less than 50%of what it really retails for. They are close to 75% and higher off that regular rate. Nice stuff but if I can pay a couple dollars more for brand new it's a no brainier not to buy from here. If they fix the prices I'd say five stars but as is three or lower.< /text>

Not the least expensive, yet a wide selection of products. Beware of "sealed" boxes, bought a pendant light and the box contains two shades, and one was broken.  Buyer beware!< /Review>

I like visiting this store for inexpensive household replacement items such as door/drawer knobs, handles, ovens, bathroom sinks, furniture etc.  Helps their agency and the store is fairly well organized.  Parking is not a problem, based on the shopping center its located at. Will definitely return to purchase items in the future.<//Text>

<Review>I love the Habitat for Humanity Restore in Simi Valley. All the people that donate
their time to help you like Taneci, Anthony 1 and Anthony 2 couldn’t have been more helpful.  I furnished my entire kitchen with custom made cabinets after an unscrupulous contractor took off with all my money and didn’t do anything but demolish my house.  I never would have been able to do it without these wonderful people at the restore.  I recommended them to my doctor who is so excited to come check it out.  And you are helping other families get their own house when you purchase items there. Sure beats the chain stores by a mile.  Thank you all at Simi Valley Restore!
I’ve posted before and after pictures

< Review>
Giving them 2 stars because the volunteers are cool. On the other hand, the company could get a better manager. This woman does not have appropriate manager/sales etiquette. I was going to purchase a item, that was on the floor.... it had a price etc. The manager, was trying to take my item away, instead of honoring the price of the item.  she said, “oh, well that item was supposed to be sold, along with another item, for double the price” I wasn’t going to purchase the other item, it was broken. Also,  after plugging my item in,  it was also broken, but it wouldn’t take much to fix the item. But the manager was still trying to say, “it shouldn’t been on the floor for that price”. There was NO WAY I was going to purchase both items for double the price, when both items were broken.
Then, while I was trying to work with her, another customer came up, wanted to purchase four identical items, it had a price tag on it. The manager instead of honoring the price for the items, she made up her own price, and said “ it was supposed to be this price”. A “GOOD MANAGER” does not do that! I have never seen a manager ever act that way. I walked out in disbelief. I will NEVER shop at this store ever again!</Review>

We dropped off some new doors that we did not use in a remodel job. The employee was very helpful taking them out of the car and making sure it was something they could take. It's an interesting store to look for things.<//Text>

Total Awesomeness of Savings. Everytime I take a trip down to this location I usually find something random that is necessary. And they might knock off a few bucks(my example, item was 25 bucks, I only had 20, they hooked it up even though  I was short that 5) I Get it,the stuff  is either used or being thrown away, but sometimes its leftovers from a construction job site. . It's great for the community.  Thanks for being open<//Review>

Uhhh EXPEN$$$IVE! Comedy store Expensive! Like Candid Camera Reaction Expensive! This place needs to move their junk to make space for NEW junk to come in! But I think they really want to hang on to everything. Seems like it. Only saw empty handed walk-outs of people after they asked the costs of some things they were interested in: place is disorganized and expensive. Know what I did with the walking out people? I followed them.< /text>

I ordered on the app twice & my order was not correct for my sandwich’s both times. It clearly says on top of the recite I asked for extra lettuce & a little bit more of oil & vinegar. I called about my order the second time which was today & the lady said they would make another sandwich & how sorry they were. I am on complete bed bed rest due to my pregnancy & I open the sandwich & it’s not even the correct sandwich I ordered in the beginning. I had to pick out the wax peppers because I cannot eat any hot foods or whatever hot due to having ulcerative colitis. They made me an all white sandwich when I ordered wheat, didn’t put extra lettuce, cheese was put when I didn’t order cheese at all, none of what I ordered in my sandwich was correct, & whoever made the sandwich put so much mayo. It was sloppy. Thanks KingsBurg! I have to avoid the Selma location because they’re just as stingy with the lettuce. I will be ordering again from here & my husband will be there to watch our order be made correctly with the extra lettuce I asked for. It’s not hard to put extra toppings when the customer pays for what they want.

UPDATE April 12, 2021

I was unable to respond to the owner, I also called to ask to speak to the manager & gave my name along with my call back number. It’s been a week now & I have not received a call back from the manager. Yes, I know what I ordered but if you look correctly on “special instructions” part & it’s listed on top of the recite (which I don’t have anymore nor did I take a picture of it), it clearly states Please extra lettuce on the BMT with cucumbers & no pepperoni & a little more vinegar & oil. The second BMT does not have cucumbers & it also says “less lettuce.” If I wasn’t on bed rest I’d go watch my sandwich be made so I could have my little bit of extra lettuce & the wheat bread not the white. Thank you for the response, I hope next time my order will be made correct & not so sloppy.</Text>

Everytime this place gets our order wrong. This time the owner was rude
when I called and asked for my money back. I ordered 2 spicey italians with provolone and bacon. We got 2 bacon sandwiches with hardly anything on them. So over places who can't get a simple order right and then act like it's your fault when they screw up. I guess that's rather lose customers by arguing than say oh we are sorry.</Review>

Pass through kingburg on the way to work and regularly stop at subway. Cannot help but notice that the Indian employees know nothing about customer service. They are extremely lazy when it comes to taking customers for some odd reason and I say this because every time I've came in, it has been the same exact girl every time taking my order plus another 10 people in line while she's all alone and while this is happening, there are 2-3 Indian employees in the lobby either sitting around complaining about how tired they are, or mopping while there is a line out the door. (Please use your common sense) the floor is going to get worse when it's wet and the lobby is full of customers. It's sad to see the same poor girl all alone taking orders with no help. Great sandwiches though (worth the 25 min wait)<//review>

Max amount of people in store is 37 and that includes staff in store.

Had to wait in line 10 families in front of us. Ended up waiting only 10 minutes. Not that bad.

Pretty good deals and was, as usual,  clean inside the store.< /Review>

One of the staff members was like in a bad mood. He yell at my 2year daughter, just because she was playing at the castle in the middle of the store. I talk to another staff member to place  a complaint just to find out that the guy that yell at my daughter was the manager of the store.

< review>
I'm not a Disney-phile, but I did enjoy my time at the local Disney Store.

Shockingly, the prices aren't bad here!  Being Disney, I expected price tags demanding beaucoup bucks.  However, most of the prices were reasonable, for the most part, and newborn/infant goods were 30% off.

The store has an attractive, easy to navigate layout, with Star Wars & Marvel immediately on the left, and princess merchandise on the right.  Seeing plush pillows of Yoda, Darth Vader & Spider-Man,  I can't deny I had an inkling to buy the whole lot of them.

On the right of the registers, an interactive area allows guests to watch movies, have storytime, play games & otherwise enjoy their Disney shopping experience.

Service was good.  The employees were quick to introduce themselves & ask if we needed any assistance.  We were only browsing, but it was great to feel welcome while we were there.

Being my first time in the store, I had an overall positive experience at my local Disney Store.  There are so many sickeningly cute & cuddly tchotchkes, it'll make your head spin.  Factor in competitive pricing, and the Disney Store becomes a top option for gifts, especially when it comes to Disney & Disneyland fans.

Highly recommend!< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) It was a little bit smaller than the Hollywood Disney thing. I wanted to buy a Mary Poppins badge but I did not ... ㅠ ㅠ But I also have a sale, and I bought Mary Poopins Cup instead.

(Translated by Google) GUESS brand store located in Las Americas Outlet, usually the stores in that square everything is very chosen and mixed, in this store no, I don't know if for the prices not very cheap or because they do not sell anything spectacular.
Very X clothes and accessories for the prices they handle, especially the ladies' bags, too ugly to pay $ 100 plus TAX for them.
Otherwise, sometimes saturated parking and in high season it is a martyrdom to enter and exit the plaza and the San Ysidro area.

(Original)
Tienda de la marca GUESS ubicada en Las Américas Outlet, por lo regular las tiendas en esa plaza todo esta muy escogido y revuelto, en esta tienda no, no se si por los precios no muy barato o por que no venden nada espectacular.
Ropa y accesorios muy X para los precios que manejan, en especial los bolsos para damas, muy feos como para pagar $100 dls más TAX por ellos.
Por lo demas estacionamiento a veces saturado y en temporada alta es un martirio entrar y salir de la plaza y del área de San Ysidro.< /text>

Today I was thinking of switching over to Verizon due to my past experiences with customer service at AT&T. Thankfully, a woman by the name of Alyssa changed my mind! Not only did she listen to all of my issues, she sat with me and broke everything I couldn’t understand down for me. She placed me on an Elite plan which was the best option for me and my 5 other lines, she was also able to help set me up on Auto Pay & Paperless billing. I am very grateful I got to meet this kind young lady and she is the reason I’m staying with AT&T! Thank you Alyssa, you are the definition of perfect customer service!!< /text>

I would like to say I highly recommend ALYSSAL L at the Tehachapi AT&T store! She is very professional with her customers and has a great smile and is always happy!
She takes her time to explain everything you need to know and doesn’t make you feel rushed! Thank you for all your help! ❤️< /Text>

I needed to figure out a more effective way for my two daughters to attend on-line school while staying with me out in the back of Sand Canyon.  Hughes net simply was not cutting it and I was having to use my AT&T phone as a hot spot which worked quite well.  As I entered the store, there was a customer who seemed extremely upset and the clerk working behind the counter, Ashley, was extremely poised and attempted to explain the situation to the upset customer.  I am a 24yr veteran who has worked in communications that entire time with extensive experience working customer service and help desk.  Very few times have I seen a situation handled so professionally!  Good job Ashley.   Additionally, Richard went way beyond my expectations for helping me get a 4G router set up and even checked the functionality prior to me leaving so that my daughters can spend more time with me out here in the remote parts of Tehachapi and I can't thank him enough as well!!

Outstanding job,
A very happy customer<//Text>

Nick and Richard were really fabulous! Helped me figure out the best phone for my needs. Nick took transferring my contacts and photos as a personal challenge to my new Apple phone. With all the crashing/rebooting, he had to get really creative, but he did it!!!  I was really impressed with how well they handled other customers in the store and on the phone all while helping me. You’re in good hands at this store. Thanks so much, Nick and Richard!!!!< /review>< Pics>

<Review>I have been going to this store since they opened, yesterday I went to update my IPHONE TO 11 PRO MAX. Richard Lueder took his time & explained to me and updated my phone. EXCELLENT service by him. The store owner is  lucky to have him as a employee.. ONE OF THE BEST SERVICE I EVER HAD. I waited almost 2- hours for my turn because He was working by himself but It was worth it.</Review>< Pics>

The Tehachapi AT&T store is a joke!  The worst customer service constantly.  I wont even pay my bills in that store anymore.  They have lied about services I would get.  Changed services on my account many times that I never asked for.  Your best bet would be to skip this store completely.< /Text>

I went into the Tehachapi AT&T store a couple days ago with a technical issue involving a wireless security camera which works on the AT&T network system. Tristen and his assistant (NFD) assisted me in getting the new camera device to work. He started by replacing the SIM card but that in itself didn’t resolve the issue. Tristen continued to work with the camera, use manual and internet and diligently attempted several techniques over and over until he was finally able to get the camera to work effectively on line. Tristen went far and beyond my expectations to help me resolve my technical issue involving my security camera.

Please let Tristen know that I am very thankful for his experience and dedication to resolving my issue.

Kudos my friend

<Text>The stupidity and ignorance of most of the employees, including the manager, at this store is stupefying.

My husband and I went in on September 16th, 2016 to order the iPhone 7 Plus. Not only did they allow some poor new girl to work the day the iPhone 7 was released, there is that mind blowing stupidity I was talking about, but it took over AN HOUR. (I literally went online to order one just to see how long it would have taken...it took me less than 5 minutes.) There were 2 other employees there who were trying to help the poor, extremely lost and confused new person, but were also dealing with a line out the door.

I can get past the allowance of a new person to work such a hectic day and that it took over an hour, but not that THEY made a mistake and did not charge us the taxes that we were fully prepared to pay. When we inquired about it, one of the employees told us not to worry about it. They did not know what happened, but it was their fault and we were not to worry about it. Sounds like good customer service, but that has been the beginning of the nightmare. It is now November 11th, 2016 and NO PHONE because they DID NOT file it and send it in and now it is our fault we did not pay the taxes.

They are now trying to insist it is our fault for not paying the taxes when I asked, and then asked again (god forbid I did not think to record the entire 60 to 80 minutes train wreck going on). Hours upon hours have been spent calling and trying to sort it all but each person contacted seems to be more illiterate, uniformed, and untrained than the last.

Words cannot express enough the frustration and fury at the incompetence of the people at this store.< /Text>< resp>

Opened up a new line with them and the female sales rep lied to me just to get a sale, I got the unlimited plan and the first question I asked her was if my employee discount applied and she told me yes numerous of times which it doesn’t and quoted me for the unlimited choice plan and when the deal was done I found out she gav me the plus plan which is more expensive! Worst sales rep EVER!!!</text>< pics>

<text>Absolutely appalling. The installation process was a mess, to begin with. They sent a grand total of 6 different people out over the course of three days, and at the end of it all, said they would have to lower the speed we were paying for. But, here's the kicker. It's not low enough to qualify for another plan, no, so we're stuck paying the same amount for crappier internet. Speaking of paying, there's always a "payment issue"? Example, our internet has been complete crap the past few days. Dropping constantly for hours at a time. Customer service is ABSOLUTELY NO HELP whatsoever. Finally checked out the account (from my phone using data) and it said our bill hasn't been paid. But, it was paid 7 days ago. The money transfer was confirmed both on the bank account statement and on the AT&T account. However, now they're saying we never paid the bill? This is the second time to happen, and we've only had it since January of this year. If you're thinking about AT&T, I suggest a different provider. They don't care about whether or not you have internet, and they'll try to suck as much money out of you as they can.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<Text>Horrible. Came in to switch from another provider, had already spoken with a guy twice who said he would help me there and to come on in. I show up and there's one girl helping a customer with two other guys standing around. They ask me to wait. Another woman comes in and one of the guys starts helping her. I walked out, they lost a customer due to horrible service.</Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I always try to support a local family-owned shop instead of a national chain whenever I can. I was getting ready to drive my car cross country back to the East coast and needed brand new suspension. The car had about 80,000 miles on it and was woefully in need of almost a complete suspension replacement including shocks, struts, stabilizer bars etc.. In addition I was due for a new set of tires. Anyone who's worked on a car from the East coast knows that we have particular ways to deal with rusty components as a result of the salt on the roads during winter. Generally if soaking it in WD-40 doesn't work, you bust out a torch and if that doesn't work then you break the part and replace it. Initially it looked like they weren't going to be able to fix one of the stabilizer bars without breaking it, but I asked them to have a little patience and let the WD-40 do its work overnight and the next day they were able to break it free and finish the alignment. The car drives like a dream now and the alignment is perfectly spot on. I just did about 60 miles of straight desert driving barely having to touch the steering wheel. The quality of the work was top-notch and worth the investment. The only constructive criticism I have is that they could do a slightly better job of communicating with customers, but then again the quality of the work is the most important thing to me.< /Review>

<Review>I have gone to Claderon shops many times over the past 20 years. This shop was fantastic and plugged my tire in minutes. I also had a recycled tire put on my truck a few months back. So quick and best prices hands down . Also everyone is so knowledgeable and friendly. 10 stars<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>They have reasonable prices and perform the work quickly. Oscar is amazing. I went in there for a leaky tire and was out within 15 minutes. I had to come back again as I felt that my tire looked weird. Oscar looked at it again and ensured me that it was fine and nothing was amiss. Great people who are down to earth.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record>

Great prices--AND my balancing and tire disposal was included in the price, unlike other area shops.  Helpful and engaging service. My one complaint was that the waiting are was cold and dark and I needed to plug in to work and couldn't find an outlet.<//Review>

< Review>
My wife's car had one bad tire and a year ago a friend gave us a tire that had the correct size, so I drove to Calderon with the new tire and after a few minutes the mechanic came to my car and within 10 minutes had the new tire in place. Friendly, great service and better price than I found elsewhere.< /Review>

I can't comment on their new stock, but what I can vouch for is their services and used stock. I have been getting used tires from Calderon for many years now and have never been disappointed. They sell a used tire for about half the price of a new tire and I still manage to get 1-2 years of use out of them - granted I drive really safe, but that's bang for your buck. They also don't unnecessarily add services unless you specifically ask or they have a conversation with you about why they may suggest it. Really cool staff.<//Review>

Really friendly and knowledgeable staff. Very affordable as well. For $20 even, swapped out my summer wheels for winter ones and the person helping me took care to put the right wheel at the right position (based on the wear pattern of tires).

Highly recommended.<//text>

Came in on 1/27/2017 with a 2016 Ford Fusion that had a blow out cause of a pothole in San Francisco ughhhh. If that wasn't bad enough the tire I had was very hard to find which was a Michelin energy saver. I was looking for a used one so I came in and unexpectedly the mechanic brought in the same type of tire and almost the same of amount of tread! I quickly took their offer for 60$ I was very happy with my service. Not only that but I was in and out the door in 15 minutes! Very Special Thanks to the mechanic and the sweet front desk lady!

P.S. I voluntarily owe them Donuts.<//review>

Nail out, plug in, four tires checked and pumped up, 15 min., $15.  Half the price of a major tire brand store and much faster.</text>

Super-fast service, very friendly and polite, and pumped the new tires to the spec – something that many shops servicing specifically Subarus have failed to do for me in the past.< /review>

These guys are scams. They'll sell you junk tires and will not cover any type of liability of used tires.. Do your research and pls know what you're buying.<//Review>

<review>scratched up 2 of my wheels a lot when mounting new tires. It was cheap and I confronted them about it and they wouldn't admit it was them, although I didn't push them hard. It was cheap though, $72.< /review></record>

<text>The absolute best place to finance equipment. these guys get it, is not always just about your credit Score, sure, life happens and you get dinged but these guys see the opportunity and and will give you the chance you deserve to finance your equipment and get your business off the ground. I love them, highly recommended, high levels of service and availability.  They say Yes when everyone else has already denied you for credit. they will take a chance with you so make sure you return the favor  by making your payments ON TIME, I promise if you pay on time there is nothing to complain about.
Don't hesitate, they are legit, yes you pay a premium but man it is well deserved.<//text><gmapID>0x80c2bb675031ac27:0x396e48cafe4a2d21<//gmapID>< rating>

Worthless company ever! My wife Gail and I got passed on to them from whole sale truck financing. We recently had an accident.the insurance company was on top of it and sent the money for repairs to Dakota financing. Truck has been repaired for several weeks now and Dakota financing. Wil not send the check to us so we can get our truck back!!! Been out of work almost 3 month's now.  Going to talk to lawyer today about suing them for lost wages and our insurance money!! Stay away from these crooks< /text>

. This company is very unprofessional, no return phone calls or emails. I bought a truck leased it on to a company in a different state nothing to do with the state I live in. Now they need all this other paperwork because my business name is in my state. Talked to Dmv, Department of revenue and the city I live in and they require nothing because the truck is not getting titled,plated or anything in my state. Read all the reviews not just the 5 stars. I  should have but didn't!!</Review>

<review>This Company Dakota Financial Helped Me Finance My Truck. My Husband And I Had A Man Named Ian Flannery, He Was Straight To The Point And Was On Top Of Everything In Regards To Getting Paper Work Done, What He Needed From Me And What I Needed To Make This Deal Happen.
Also, I Forgot To Add That I Was Also Lied Too A lot About How The Process Was Going To Go. They Explained To Me That I Would Be Giving A Deposit On A Truck And The Money I Gave End Up Not Going Towards The Truck At All.

< Review>
This is by far the worse financial company ever.  They sent the title to wrong DMV and DMV sent it back, and they REFUSED to send the title to the correct DMV. I tried to get the title so I can register the truck and was passed around for a month. I bought  out my contract and they sent the title out the next day.

As a truck owner or a truck driver you know no money will be made unless the truck is running, and to have my truck held for a month because the finance company refused to send the title DMV is the worse feeling ever.

I would not recommend Dakota Financial, LLC  to any one who is looking to purchase a truck or a trailer.

So before you sign your contract  with Dakota Financial, LLC consider a different finance company.

Worse company.
Worse customer service.<//Review>

This bank has delayed us getting our title from them over a month stating they’re overwhelmed and backed up because of COVID-19. Understandable, but when we asked to defer our payment coming due since they have delayed the process they declined. Finally they confirmed they located the title so we gave them a DMV satellite service to send the title, it took two weeks for them to tell us they cannot because the office is located outside of NY. Then we say ok fine we’re moving to Florida send it to a dmv there. The bank then required all these documentation as proof we’re moving so we explained after the holidays we would be moving and once we have everything we would submit everything but it would take time. I. Called today 01/21 to inform them we have everything and they sent the title to NY dmv because they stated “we took too long”. We called on the 17th of December and they sent the title to NY dmv on 1/11/2021 that’s less than one month. So no regards that we told them it would take time to get documentation and make an appointment in Florida. They were rude during every interaction, not empathetic, nor treating us like customers. We got hung up on many times!! This is not how you treat your customers... extremely displeased with this bank and the way they do business.</Review>

Dakota’s team, specifically Erin, have been amazing to work with.  They have expediently gone out of their way to respond to any and all needs and wants that our company has had.

I vehemently disagree with the reviewers who have given negative reviews as our experience with Dakota has been that of going above and beyond for our company!

Thank you Erin and the entire Dakota team!!< /review>

This company is the worst company to deal with. The told me you can pay off your lease after the first 9 payments, I called them the Tenth month spoke to one of their representatives he told me you can’t pay off the rest of the amount and It’s a lease for 36 months! I took of a loan for $13,525 ended up paying them $30,825!!! The interest is a way more than the loan!< /Text>

Alot of these good reviews by people with no profile pic are not real people. My experience with this finance company has been terrible I was approved for 30k but when they got the invoice for the equipment that was bidded on they said they were not going to finance the Trailer I bid on beacause it was a 2000 utility flat bed and I did not bid the price high enough for them to make any money on it. They basically wanted me  me to pay fo the trailer   and that was not what we agreed on so  they pretty much screwed me with Ritchie  bros auction  because their lack of communication.  Stay away from theses company</review>

Jason Sinclair @ His team are great to work with. Sadly, the reviews on here not an accurate representation of the company. They provide business loans to companies who have a checkered past, and in most cases, no one would give them a chance. Dakota has worked with us to help our customers get a second chance. 5 Stars +  --- TM</text>

<Text>Most pathetic company if I could give a negative 5 star I would. I borrowed 11,500 and they had to buy a lien on my truck which was worth 30k or so. I agreed to pay 588 a month for 36 months. My truck was totaled on the ninth month into the loan and my insurance company had to pay the lien holder the payoff amount. The payoff amount was over 16k and they would NOT let me use another truck for  collateral. So I got 27k for my truck with a 2.5k deductible and now my insurance pays Dakota over 16k for a payoff. It ticks me off. They weren't flexible at and rude. I don't care if your desperate don't use them call me, I'll give the money before this company.<//Text><response>None<//response><Date>1500393405138</Date><pics>None< /pics>< UserId.>

So I'll try give you an understanding & we are With the guy that said if we could give a negative five stars we would. We originally were disputing the 2012 Freightliner for the past couple months with Penske from the day we picked up the truck in February when it was supposed to be ready in January, noticing body work that was promised wasn't done, and annual smoke inspection overdue. Took them a few days to get back with us, by then I noticed other problems wrong with the truck. After going back and forth with Penske for the past couple months and having an attorney send a demand letter. They offered us crumbs to shut us up to wash their hands even though the total repairs are over $11,000. We felt we had no other choice. We even pursued using the extended warranty which they say didn't cover any of the repairs needed to be done. So after calling our finance company Dakota Financial just to find out what was left on our loan of what we thought was a purchase and me bringing up the $9,333 down payment. We where told that that was not a down payment its a security deposit. The truck was listed at $29,000 with our insurance and extended warranty came up to about $31,000. Premier financing which is a separate entity from Penske, which I see today ironically has the same address as Penske 2675 Morgantown Rd Reading, PA 19607. Premier finance originally told us we were purchasing this truck that California had special laws and they had to write the contract up as such but they we are buying the truck. Dakota Financial said no we signed a lease agreement for 36 months at $1237 which adds up to $44,532 and at that point we can purchase the truck for $9,333 which brings up to total of $55,000. Had we known this we would have never 1. leased a used vehicle for this much 2. purchased a used truck for this much. I have emails from Premier asking for the downpayment which insinuate we were putting a down payment for purchasing this truck. Also on the cover sheet of Dakotas Financial agreement it states down payment as well. From what I read a down payment is for the purchase of property not a deposit for a lease. We have since yesterday already emailed them asking them if they are saying this is a lease that we want to return the truck to Dakota and get a full deposit and any money I've put out for current repairs. Without fixing the rest of the repairs that we can't afford this truck will be broke down for good in less than a month. The truck has been at the shop since April 5 2019 and we are supposed to get it back today if the over heating is fixed which I will have to pay about $3500 but none of the other issues I can fix. This truck was supposed to be a Premium truck not an as is truck. But it appears to be worth nothing.

So it sounds like this is a game all 3 companies have been running for a long time. We can't go after Penske but as per the contract this truck belongs to Dakota & Premier Financing is the one that sold this loan to us which I've attached an email I sent to them this morning. It looks like Penske left Dakota with a bad truck and Dakota financial had a bad sales man Premier Financing. Both Premier Financing and Dakota have ignored my emails. We would just like to return this lemon truck and get all of our money back. So we can try to get out of this bad title loan we took out on our already paid off car to get this truck. This truck was our only source of income for the time being and we have been without work for over a month now.

If you are mislead or deceived by this company you should file a report with the FTC, Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the bbb, &  the DMV, a long with looking for the right lawyer to protect your rights.< /Text>

This company is among the worst loan sharks out there!  They doubled the amount of what I financed from them.  They told me I can pay off my loan after 9 months and then reneged on me.  My truck was stolen and I have my suspicions.  The insurance company is paying them off and I am left with no title, no insurance money.  I feel so cheated!!   Big Team Trucking, Inc.<//text>

<text>Terrible Deal, We were approved for a preset amount and had agreed to the down payment. They said to go ahead and bid on some equipment at an auction, several times. We bid, got our invoice, sent to Dakota Financial, LLC and they denied due to a couple items were less than there $10,000 minimum. They became very hard to get ahold of then. Asked if they could just finance the 1 big ticket item that was well over $10,000. They will not respond. They never advised us of this stipulation. Just that the invoice had to be from a dealer or auction company. Makes for a tough situation for us now. Had to give 1 star to post.<//text>< pics>

<Text>This is a very greedy organisation.
The people are there to reap you off all you earn without a precise explanation of what you will be charged.
They will not work with you to help you grow.

This is your last result for equipment financing.

They will promise you pay off discount... But that is a lie.
They will come up with various charges just to take your hard earn money.
you have limited control of how they take your money cos you gave them authorization in the signed agreement.< /Text>< pictures>

Used them several times off an on over the last 5 years.  Never had an issue.  I imagine a lot of these bad reviews are from people who couldnt pay back their loans and are somehow deciding that asking a customer to pay a loan back on time somehow equates to bad customer service.<//Review>

Terrible place to do business with. Their "Lease agreement" as they call it, is their way of getting out of following the Truth in Lending Act. Most loan documents provide the original amount to be financed, length of terms, and payoff amount. Their "Lease Agreement" does none of this! They told my husband he has an Installment loan that has no interest....ha! The original amount to finance was $17,210. The agreement says $1012 a month for 36 months and thats it... nothing else! Well you do the math: $1012x36=$36,442...the original cost of the  semi was $37,210. I put it in an amortization schedule and the interest rate is 57.46368%. The maximum legal interest rate in CA is 10%. We're in Michigan and our maximum legal interest rate is 25%...like I said...their "Lease Agreement" jargon gets them around the Truth in Lending Act. Be very careful when considering this company!< /text>

Dakota Financial, LLC
I have a very negative experience with this company.  I paid off my loan in January 07 of this year (2016).  For a mistake I am paying all the time the TOLLs for other company (not mine), also they took an extra monthly payment from my checking account, and now in May 07, 2016 they still looking for the error of tolls and don't send me my title because they still working on the case.

I need my Title of my Truck, but four months later, they still working on the case.

Interest rate was so High!, so I paid it as soon as possible

Take care!!!!</Text>

I started coming here back in February for upper back and shoulder pain.  It turns out I have "military neck". Ever since I started coming here I rarely get migraines which was not something I originally thought would get better.  I used to get tension migraines a few times a month.  My shoulder and upper back pain also went away within a few weeks.  I've been able to fall asleep fast and stay asleep without waking up to readjust myself. I can also sit for long periods now without having to adjust or stretch because of discomfort.  I went back to my workout routine but focus on my upper body and the exercises given to make sure the pain doesn't come back.  If you are not active and don't do the exercises directed, I don't think you'll make long term improvements. Or you'll feel the need for constant adjustments to make the pain go away.  I went from going 3 times a week to just once every 2 weeks. A big part is staying active.  If you aren't going to at least lightly work out in conjunction with the adjustments you won't feel the best possible improvements.  I need to stay active and stretch multiple times a week. The pain bothered me so much and I never want to go back to that.  I rather spend the time and do light cardio, light lifting and stretching than go back to way I was feeling earlier in the year. I highly recommend this place for people suffering from the same problems I had. This has helped me in so many unexpected areas.  I'm very happy with my results.</review>

I am so grateful to Dr Ratkovic that he helped me to really enjoy my walks and hikes again without constant hip and lower back pain. At my first visit he diagnosed and explained the cause of the pain, adjusted me and also recommended specific stretching and strengthening exercises followed by icing. It's really helpful that he follows up with emails of short videos clearly explaining how to do the exercises. After less than 3 weeks of adjustments and exercises I feel so much better and keep improving.
Also no long wait times for appointments and staff is very friendly.
Highly recommend this office.< /Text>

<Text>Hands down best chiropractors in the area! Both Dr. Weaver and Dr. Ratkovic are great at what they do. Front desk staff are always professional, kind, and friendly. I was down with a pinched nerve caused by a herniated disc which was extremely painful, I found them on Yelp and I am so glad I picked them to help me. I never felt pressured to purchase their services, from day one everyone was nice and polite. Dr. Ratkovic started by showing me an x-ray of my condition and diagnosed my problem right away. With their help I am now able to drive to work, work throughout the day, and enjoy time with my family. Being a first time patient and also being the first time that something like this happens to me, I strongly advice you to realize that problems like these do not get cured right away. It takes time for these issues to arise and they will also take time to heal.  Their pricing options are very fair and if you see them offer you a package, it’s not because they are trying to rip you off, I witnessed first hand how issues like these take time to heal so know that if you have a particular issue, their excellent priced packages are there so that they can help you heal; they are not a scam. I usually don’t write reviews unless I find something that I truly believe in. Thank you for all your help Euclid Chiropractic! Very thankful I found you guys!</Text>< pics>

Thanks to you and the whole team  at Euclid chiropractic for the speed recovery . I went in there with a really bad messed up tailbone and feel better.

My daughter and I have been going to Euclid Chiropractic for a couple of months.  We both have medical concerns that the doctors have had no explanation for and just medicaided the issues.  Euclid Chiro has not only addressed these concerns but brought up new ideas to continue to help enrich our lives on our own as well.  I would highly recommend this office!<//review>

<Name>Quintessence “QT” Tucker<//Name><pictures>None< /pictures><Text>My husband started going to see Dr Ratkovic and Dr Weaver about 4 months ago after going to another chiropractor that just wasn't working out.

In that time of him seeing these two he went from being unable to perform standard daily activities to now being able to do so. This place is great, the entire staff is wonderful from Bonnie the Office Manager, to the always positive and helpful ladies JJ and Kelly down both Dr Ratkovic and Weaver.

Both Doctors are truly invested in your well-being and healing, I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an honest, personable, professional Chiropractic experience!

They treat you like family, they even call to check on you on their off days. I couldn't ask for a better set of doctors.</Text>< date>

<Review>I can’t express enough how much I love this place! I suffered a low back injury that left me unable to work and was living a very limited, painful way of life. After finding little to no relief from my primary healthcare providers I gave this place a try. Dr.Tony is my hero, he listens carefully to my concerns and questions...I feel heard for once! I would’ve never guessed I’d come this far in my road to living a normal life once again.< /Review></record>

I was recommended by a good friend to take my internship here it has been great and Dr. Tony especially has blessed me with many opportunities as I am learning new things everyday. From a working and client perspective the atmosphere has been great and is always positive. Dr. Tony explains the procedures to his patients in a way everyone can understand so that all of his patients are comfortable and knowledgeable with their treatments and look forward to their next visit.< /review>

It was my first visit a few months ago to a Chiropractor and have been coming in to see Dr. Anthony Ratkovic.  He is very informative and professional with the treatment he provides.  The visits have helped me out tremendously and would highly recommend to all.  The entire staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable.<//Review>

<text>Had very good experience at Euclid Chiropractic.
Was a very good experience staff and chiropractors there are concerned compassionate caring and very much caring.
Every one in office treats you with respect.
I have gone to several other chiropractors and this one is far most the best. My treatment has helped since my first visit I also got a phone call the very next day to see how I was feeling and was also emailed exercises that I was to do at home.
Thank You so much Euclid Chiropractic!
I definitely recommend your services.< /text>< pictures>

The doctor explained to me well my condition. With affordable X-ray and consultation rate, I was able to visibly understand the cause of my back. Also, right after my first adjustment, I really felt relieved and was able to sleep well after a very long time. The doctor also was kind enough to provide tips on exercise, on how to walk and sit. Those small tips provided a lot of changes and made me more aware of posture :) the doctor is also kind :)</review>

I came with severe pain in mid-back and, after x-rays, Dr Tony was able to give me a strong adjustment that set it up for healing and much less pain.
He makes the adjustment for what I need and will help my spine to stay
in good condition. He also gives me exercises to do to strengthen my back
so I can do more and have good posture.   He will help you too!</Text>

From the moment I became a patient 3 yrs ago now I have felt at home with both Dr's. their both amazing at what they do. I have a very physical job working at UPS and it doesn't matter what hurts or aches after I leave their care I feel a million times better. It's by far the BEST in every aspect I can't say I wish something was different or better that is one peaceful office to be a patient at.</text>

<Date>1483660321724</Date><Text>So after over 2 years of ignoring my sciatic nerve issues, I finally had to reach out to a chiropractor after attempting a 34 mile bike ride and the pain finally was too much to bear.
I received an Xray and MRI from my medical provider in the beginning of my leg numbness but was continuously prescribed pain killers when I didn't have any pain and therapy that exhausted my company sick leave.
With Dr. Tony and his staff, I have received guidance, support and quality therapy for my condition.  No pain meds, learning to stretch again and build up my strength naturally and with moderation, has helped me get back on the right track.  I'm so fortunate to have found the Euclid Chiropractic Clinic and look forward to getting my spine back into shape...literally.  I don't look at my appointments as a medical treatment but instead I'm visiting the Spine Spa!<//Text>< gmap_id>

<review>Dr. Ratkovic and Weaver are professional, very skilled, personable and have excellent bedside manner. Taylor and the front office staff are awesome too! I was treated by both doctors in 2015 after the birth of my daughter as I was feeling neck and back pain from nursing my baby. They were sensitive to my needs and made adjustments to my treatment in accordance with what I was able to tolerate. I Immediately felt better and the numbness that I was experiencing  began to disappear. I am currently pregnant with my second child and continue to be treated by both doctors for the hip pain I am experiencing during this pregnancy; I trust both of them with my healthcare and HIGHLY recommend both Dr. Ratkovic and Weaver.< /review>< rate>

<date>1502448312288<//date><Review>Euclid Chiropractic Care

Great place to get your Chiropractic Care @ Upland, CA!  I chose to go to this clinic after my auto accident because of its 5 star reviews on line.  During my initial visit Taylor greeted me with her sweet smile and soft gentle voice and handed me the paper works for the admission process.  I did not feel hurried even though I was few minutes late for my appointment.  Dr. Tony (Anthony Ratkovic, D.C.) was very thorough with his examination and explained clearly the condition of my spine caused by the auto accident.  I was treated immediately with ultrasound, application of ice packs, adjustment and massage which provided some degree of pain relief on the affected areas.  My daily visits brought gradual and increasing pain relief due to muscle spasms, stiffness and pressure pains to my neck, shoulders, lower back and hips.  I was also treated by Dr. Brian Weaver who was equally personable and professional like Dr Tony.  The treatments helped me tremendously with my healing, physically, spiritually, emotionally, & mentally!  KUDOS TO ALL OF YOU, DR. TONY!<//Review><Response>None</Response><user_name>Shirley Steen</user_name>< gmap_id>

<review>I see both Dr. Weaver and Dr. Ratkovic and they are both amazing. I have bulging discs in my neck and back that has lead to me having poor posture while sitting thus creating more pain than the discs bulging alone. After a few weeks of 2-3 adjustments a week, I made a small improvement. It's not 100% fixed (yet-if even possible) but the improvement alone is huge for me given my orthopedic surgeon has done nothing but pop pain pills in me. I will be continuing my treatment for another 8 weeks combined now with exercise and hopefully more improvement will happen. So happy I trusted my fiancé with trying a chiropractor for my chronic pain.<//review>< rate>

<Text>I've been experiencing chronic neck pain and felt as though I would never get better. I have tried massages, physical therapy and standard medical treatment with minimal relief. I was apprehensive to consider chiropractic treatment; however, this has been the best my neck has felt in many years. I have been receiving treatment for almost a month now, and I am surprisingly starting to feel some relief for the first time in many, many years. I am 52 years old and thought I was just going to have to deal with the constant pain. Now I'm optimistic that these doctors can help me to feel well again and enjoy the things I love to doing-like fishing, hiking and exploring the great outdoors. I would highly recommend them to anyone.< /Text>< Pictures>

< Review>
I was recommended to Euclid Chiropractic by my Uncle while I was going to a different chiropractor, and I must say I wish I had switched much sooner. They explain exactly what's going on and they know what they're talking about. Before I started treatment I was having constant pain from my lower back injury, and now I can actually function like a normal person! Quitting work because of my injury was devastating, and now I have a life again. If you're having any back problems you owe it to yourself to see them.<//Review>

<Review>Just want to say thanks to the Euclid Chiropractic team for making my life that much more enjoyable. Coming from the construction industry, Ironworker to be Exact,  my body has taken a beating from 12 years of wear and tear.  I have never in my  35 years been to a chiropractor; i always thought that if i was never in a car accident why do i need to see one.But for the past 4-5 years i have developed some serious lower back and right hip pain and discomfort.. I felt like an 80 year old man. I had difficulty  getting out of bed, Tie-ing  my boots before work, picking items off the floor, sitting/driving in my truck, and constant discomfort to my right side of hip, lower back. So my first Visit, EVER to a chiropractor,( To be honest i was a bit nervous, scared-not -really) was a great experince. The front desk staff ( Tyler and crew) were very welcoming,professional, and hospitable. Dr Weaver and Dr.Racovich  the greatest guys in the world. Got some X-rays done on my 2nd visit, came back  on my third visit to go over X-rays and find what was going on with my back and hip....
and my thereafter visits, i got treated by DR.Brian  or DR. Tony. Looking back on this time of Rehabilitation, i am very thankful that  Euclid Chiropractic in upland helped me get rid of this discomfort and pain to my lower back and hip. Not only  did they adjust me physically  but also equipped me mentally on the importance of Maintaining the body with proper excercises, technique, strength training, posture, and stretches.</Review>< date>

Very professional and very caring staff. The Dr did x-rays of my back and neck. He adjusted my back and neck. Also gave me many stretching exercises to do. This has really made a huge difference in my recovery.  I would recommend this office to anyone who is suffering from back pain.< /Text>

Very clean, Doctor's are very professional and VERY SKILLED. I went to a chiropractor before after a car accident I had and never was fixed as you say. I came twice to Dr. Tony and I have never been better in such a short length of time. Now I can actually bend without pain and living a normal life again. Thank you very much Dr Tony. You seriously are the BEST!!!!</text>

<text>I have been suffering with chronic back and neck pain for the better part of 2016 and was using massage therapy at a place in Orange County to try and correct the issue. After 2 months of massage therapy and no results i decided to try a chiropractor. I found Euclid Chiropractor while searching the Internet and decided to give them a try based off their reviews. I have been receiving treatment now for a little over a month and although I'm not fully healed there is a huge difference in my comfort and mobility. These guys do an awesome job!<//text>< userid>

<text>This is the best chiropractors I ever visited, I own a restaurant and being the only cook I am not able to take vacations or time off to recover from any injures, my back was hurting so much and in just a few sessions they were able to make me feel great, I was back in business in no time.
Excellent service and excellent personalities on both of the doctors and their stuff as well.</text>< Pics>

At 27 years old I had the worst pain I've had in my life.
Randomly had a strong pain shoot down my lower back last night while trying to lean over my bathroom sink to wash my teeth.

The pain was the most unbearable thing i experienced, I screamed and cried out loud! Im sure it had a lot to do with my posture, picking up heavy equipment incorrectly, ergonomics at my desk and looking down at my cell phone.

My brother referred me to Euclid Chiro.
I am uninsured and was worried about the cost. The whole consultation and everything was less than $100 and I was a new patient.

Dr. Brian Weaver was knowledgable, caring and helpful.
He did Xrays and showed me the results. To my luck it was a sprained lower back muscle.
He then adjusted my back, ultrasound and cooled it with ice and gave me advice.

I instantly felt better. His positive energy and that of the staff was healing and im sure that helped a lot.

I scheduled a follow up appointment for next week.

Do not hesitate to visit them if you suffer from any back or neck pain!

If your reading this,  i'm sending positive healing vibrations to you and yours.</text>

<gmap_id>0x80c331494e42c8af:0x72472c3c70d2b04c<//gmap_id><text>I found Euclid Chiropractic on yelp.  My regular massage therapist suggested that I try chiropractic treatment after I started having sciatic pain that didn't seem to subside. The staff at Euclid Chiropractic are very friendly and helpful.  The schedule is very flexible.  Dr Tony explained my x-rays and the suggested treatment plan on the 1st visit with him.  I liked that he was up front with the amount of visits it would take to heal completely.  After the first treatment I was already having better mobility in my back and the numbness in my leg was starting to subside.  I think that the difference in this office is that Dr Tony continues to monitor you in regards to exercises and stretches to get the back strong enough to heal.  It's not just about the treatment but also to heal completely.  I would definitely recommend this office to anyone who is having any type of neck or/and back pain.<//text><UserId.>110976344688409877097< /UserId.>< time>

Dr. Ratkovic is best. Period. He is one of those types​ of doctors who you like to see but he doesn't like to see you(in pain at least). Every time​ I've come in for either an​ injury or just to keep things aligned, Dr. Ratkovic fixed me up and then has taken his time to explain things and provide exercises to prevent me from having to come back for the same issue. Who does that these days? He also has produced videos which he sends to you after your visit to help for your specific situation. Dr. Ratkovic's knowledge, skills, ​and honesty are unmatched and well worth the visit. Highly recommend​!</Review>

Dr.Ratkovic is the best! I was seeing another chiro that didn't quite get me and after a brief search via yelp, I found the Euclid clinic! They are flexible and take care of your needs based on your issues.  Unlike most other chiros in the area. Check em out!</Review>

<rating>5</rating><text>I am vision impaired and recently fell in the bedroom of our home.
My left arm and two middle fingers went numb.  At first I thought I had a bursitis problem.  However, the med's I take for that had no effect.
When the pain did not diminish, my wife suggested I call Dr. Ratkovic at Euclid Chiropractic.  We called and was able to get an appoint that same afternoon.
Using their in house X-Ray machine, Dr. Ratkovic took X-Rays and determined that I had hit the nerve bundle between my shoulder and spine.
The Dr. made an adjustment to my neck, used an ultrasound machine on the affected area then put ice on the area.
Before we left the office, I had response in my left arm and the two fingers that were numb.  I was told to put ice on the area for 10 to 15 minutes every hour or so, which I did.  By the next morning all the numbness was essentially gone.  However, we made a follow up appoint for that next day, just to make sure everything was OK.  It was and is and I'm back to work on my computer.
Although I do have bursitis from time to time I decided it was simpler to go have the problem diagnosed and fixed instead of guessing at what was going on instead of taking a lot of pain pills that hurt my stomach and don't take the pain away anyway.</text>< date>

Hey..my names dustin thompson..journeyman ironworker for local 416..ive been to four chiropractors in my life..all of them had different methods..my honest opinion is at Euclid chiropractor u have recieved the quickest and best results..#1 when i first showed up there they took an x-ray to show and know were and how to approach the problem..no other chiropractor did that for me..so your able to see before and after. results..#2 the adjusts are more frequent and there able to adjust me..ive had other chiropractors couldnt move or adjust me correctly due to there strength..#3 i like the massaging tables they use to loosen your back and icing your back as your on the massaging table..no other chiropractor has done that..long story short 👍👍 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 IM VERY SATISFIED!</Review>

Euclid Chiropractic is the place to go if you are tired of hearing about surgery and meds as the only solution for your neck or back pain .  Dr Ratkovic and Dr Weaver offer a unique perspective to healing that involves you taking control with emphasis on restoring then maintaining optimal function after an injury. With more than 20 yrs of nursing experience it took awhile for me to seek another solution to the pain that had developed over the years and feel confident that I chose the right place. The entire staff  is  courteous and punctual .. you won't be disappointed.< /text>

< Review>
Euclid chiropractic is awesome.🌾 They believe in the natural body indorvin. I have suffered with vertigo, lower and upper back pain. In 4 months the pain is gone and my vertigo is gone. Now I am able to work out at the gym 5 days a week. Never thought I would be doing the things I am doing today. They educate you to help you understand why your body is hurting. They are the best.< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Ratkovic is best. Period. He is one of those types​ of doctors who you like to see but he doesn't like to see you(in pain at least). Every time​ I've come in for either an​ injury or just to keep things aligned, Dr. Ratkovic fixed me up and then has taken his time to explain things and provide exercises to prevent me from having to come back for the same issue. Who does that these days? He also has produced videos which he sends to you after your visit to help for your specific situation. Dr. Ratkovic's knowledge, skills, ​and honesty are unmatched and well worth the visit. Highly recommend​!</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

< review>
Dr. Ratkovic and Weaver are professional, very skilled, personable and have excellent bedside manner. Taylor and the front office staff are awesome too! I was treated by both doctors in 2015 after the birth of my daughter as I was feeling neck and back pain from nursing my baby. They were sensitive to my needs and made adjustments to my treatment in accordance with what I was able to tolerate. I Immediately felt better and the numbness that I was experiencing  began to disappear. I am currently pregnant with my second child and continue to be treated by both doctors for the hip pain I am experiencing during this pregnancy; I trust both of them with my healthcare and HIGHLY recommend both Dr. Ratkovic and Weaver.</review>

<review>I was recommended to Euclid Chiropractic by my Uncle while I was going to a different chiropractor, and I must say I wish I had switched much sooner. They explain exactly what's going on and they know what they're talking about. Before I started treatment I was having constant pain from my lower back injury, and now I can actually function like a normal person! Quitting work because of my injury was devastating, and now I have a life again. If you're having any back problems you owe it to yourself to see them.<//review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Time>

<Text>Dr.Ratkovic is the best! I was seeing another chiro that didn't quite get me and after a brief search via yelp, I found the Euclid clinic! They are flexible and take care of your needs based on your issues.  Unlike most other chiros in the area. Check em out!<//Text>< Pics>

Just want to say thanks to the Euclid Chiropractic team for making my life that much more enjoyable. Coming from the construction industry, Ironworker to be Exact,  my body has taken a beating from 12 years of wear and tear.  I have never in my  35 years been to a chiropractor; i always thought that if i was never in a car accident why do i need to see one.But for the past 4-5 years i have developed some serious lower back and right hip pain and discomfort.. I felt like an 80 year old man. I had difficulty  getting out of bed, Tie-ing  my boots before work, picking items off the floor, sitting/driving in my truck, and constant discomfort to my right side of hip, lower back. So my first Visit, EVER to a chiropractor,( To be honest i was a bit nervous, scared-not -really) was a great experince. The front desk staff ( Tyler and crew) were very welcoming,professional, and hospitable. Dr Weaver and Dr.Racovich  the greatest guys in the world. Got some X-rays done on my 2nd visit, came back  on my third visit to go over X-rays and find what was going on with my back and hip....
and my thereafter visits, i got treated by DR.Brian  or DR. Tony. Looking back on this time of Rehabilitation, i am very thankful that  Euclid Chiropractic in upland helped me get rid of this discomfort and pain to my lower back and hip. Not only  did they adjust me physically  but also equipped me mentally on the importance of Maintaining the body with proper excercises, technique, strength training, posture, and stretches.</text>

Hey..my names dustin thompson..journeyman ironworker for local 416..ive been to four chiropractors in my life..all of them had different methods..my honest opinion is at Euclid chiropractor u have recieved the quickest and best results..#1 when i first showed up there they took an x-ray to show and know were and how to approach the problem..no other chiropractor did that for me..so your able to see before and after. results..#2 the adjusts are more frequent and there able to adjust me..ive had other chiropractors couldnt move or adjust me correctly due to there strength..#3 i like the massaging tables they use to loosen your back and icing your back as your on the massaging table..no other chiropractor has done that..long story short 👍👍 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 IM VERY SATISFIED!</Text>

I am vision impaired and recently fell in the bedroom of our home.
My left arm and two middle fingers went numb.  At first I thought I had a bursitis problem.  However, the med's I take for that had no effect.
When the pain did not diminish, my wife suggested I call Dr. Ratkovic at Euclid Chiropractic.  We called and was able to get an appoint that same afternoon.
Using their in house X-Ray machine, Dr. Ratkovic took X-Rays and determined that I had hit the nerve bundle between my shoulder and spine.
The Dr. made an adjustment to my neck, used an ultrasound machine on the affected area then put ice on the area.
Before we left the office, I had response in my left arm and the two fingers that were numb.  I was told to put ice on the area for 10 to 15 minutes every hour or so, which I did.  By the next morning all the numbness was essentially gone.  However, we made a follow up appoint for that next day, just to make sure everything was OK.  It was and is and I'm back to work on my computer.
Although I do have bursitis from time to time I decided it was simpler to go have the problem diagnosed and fixed instead of guessing at what was going on instead of taking a lot of pain pills that hurt my stomach and don't take the pain away anyway.<//Text>

Cant beat it! Oh, and there’s this really good restaurant near by. To die for! Called the Waypoint Café. Would recommend if you’re in the general area!</Text>< Gmap_id>

Very interesting airport.  Very small in size but hella clean and neat with a pretty good variety of food options.  But the most fascinating of all was the center of it where I found an outdoor area almost like an oasis where people could hang out and lounge around.  The provide plenty of seats indoor and outdoor.  Restrooms were extremely clean as well.</review>

<rate>1</rate><Review>I stopped by today with my 9yr old son. I waited for over 20mins and wasn't greeted served or tended to. I don't speak spanish but I'm preety sure a gentleman told the ladies I had been waiting, he pointed in our direction twice - but for whatever reason no communication not even a question in my direction was made , it was a strangely humiliating experience. I had enough time to look around.. And particularly the dirt... This place is intense. Aged old air filters with clumps of dust clinging onto the vents, sticky chairs and tables... And just too many things stuck on walls Windows etc... This place is NOT SANITARY at all.  They watched me leave, they saw my confused expression... Not one word was uttered. We are regular mother and son, light-skinned black British, but that shouldn't be a problem right?

My son pointed out a sign
"we reserve the right not to serve anyone"

We didn't bother to complain exclaim or ask it wasn't busy there was nobody else waiting

😞

I wonder...</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNhVo9vGAnHNKH3uBwKx71NUURNAq49WRWNKDwA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMQZhSBhPW_4eWYQKo4DlQN_1CeMIViYkTodgPS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOxTRiA-65BqVzsgXYzOsM7SlLXPhibv1v327qk=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><resp>None< /resp>< gmap_id>

Dry food, hard tortillas, no taste, seems if it was food from the cans..drinks too sweet  makes you more thirsty rather than being refreshing n due to covid they are not allowed to give water. Where is the manager of the restaurant does he/she ever try the food?I personally do not recommend it 😕don't get me wrong the employees are really nice and caring just the food its a no</review>

< Review>
It was my first time going to Lucy's do not recommended the burrito or tortilla chips. I am glad I order some fries, that's was good. Burrito no flavor and the chips were stale and no salsa. And the price was $11.35. I should of gone to another fast food. Never again.</Review>

<text>I hit up this place during a conference, and no other place compared. The food was great and at extremely reasonable prices for LA. I picked up 2 pastries and a large glass of orange juice, squeezed right in front of me, for 5 bucks. They were fast too, 4 people with breakfast in and out under 20-30 minutes. Great place to go if you are looking to eat on a budget.< /text><user>113292891014733088645</user></record>

< Review>
The food was ok and they had a wide variety form Mexican to American to seafood they have it. They also serve beer which is a plus when eating seafood. The prices also don't break the bank so one can eat at reasonable price. Over all good food and good prices equal a good time. Will definitely come back and enjoy.<//Review>

Ton of options, competitively priced and most importantly, tasty. If they had table service it would have the great old school diner atmosphere. Order at the counter and they bring you the food.< /Review>

Went looking for a good authentic Mexican restaurant in East LA while on vacation
Food was delicious
Had a great menu
Customer service was good
but the bathroom needs a picker upper

Overall

<Review>This food here is bomb it has that home cooked meal feeling and taste just like the mom's makes! The food is very authentic and the pan dulce us really good too! It's a little expensive but definitely worth the price the plates of food are big< /Review>< Date>

First time here, Worst wet burrito ever, it doesn’t have any taste, it’s almost as i eat a fresh dough and i guess they forgot to put the asada in it, there’s so little, paid $10.50, barely eat the meats inside the burrito, couldn’t eat the tortilla, never coming back< /review>

Big self-serve baked goods selection, mostly Mexican-style. Cakes for all occasions, both ready to go + custom-made.  Good Mexican food too, fairly cheap $, friendly.  Salsa + condiment bar in table area.  Big menu variety posted all around order counter. Don't see what you want?  Ask!  They'll prob make it for you if they can.  A step up from their 24-hr drive-thru across the street.< /Text>
