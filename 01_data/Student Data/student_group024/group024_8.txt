<Text>I absolutely loved this place! My lashes came out exactly how I wanted and I was able to give my personal preference before hand. It’s so professional, done quickly and effortlessly. Right when I walked in they were welcoming me and the atmosphere was so calming and clean. I will probably be recommending this place to my mom and sister. My experience was excellent and I will be returning. I highly recommend!<//Text>< date>

I don't usually write reviews, but after my experience at PRIM I felt compelled to communicate how great this place is and what an amazing customer experience they provide. From the lovely atmosphere, to the friendly staff, to the level of professional craft, PRIM is the full package. I had my eyebrows micro bladed and they look amazing. The process was thoroughly explained and took the time to make sure each stroke was perfect. I will be going back for additional services and highly recommend this place to anyone considering one of the services they offer.</review>

My lashes are beautiful!  I got the volume lashes and they are so lush and gorgeous! They only use premium products and it shows! You won’t regret it! Brie is awesowe! She is very professional and knowledgeable as well. I had some concerns about the my sensitive eyes, she listened and took extra time to mist and fan my eyes throughout and made sure that I was comfortable the whole time.  The staff are great! I can’t rave enough about my experience here!< /Text>

First time I went there I got a classic fill eyelash extension, they were beautiful for a natural look fill. But this second time I got the volume fill, and the volume fill is 10 times more amazing! The girl who does the volume fill is so sweet and did an AWESOME job. I highly recommend getting them done here! They are all so sweet and treat you so well as soon as you step foot in the door.</text>

Wow, I can hardly believe it's been one year since I found PRIM and the joy of having lush thick lashes.  As a blond with nearly invisible fine lashes, this new addiction (it's a good addiction) helps me feel a bit more put together as I race out the door to go teach my fitness classes.  My lash goddess, Krista, is amazing.  She makes my eyes 'pop' with her mad lash skills.  The entire staff are friendly and knowledgeable .  I always feel welcome and comfortable when I come in for my appointments.< /text>

This was my first time at Prim and my first experience having a hydra facial. I absolutely loved the whole experience and felt really refreshed, restored and happy with results. I booked A return appointment with Monica and wish i knew about this years ago. The atmosphere is so pleasant and welcoming and staff was very accommodating. I guess It’s never to late to start and it was a confident booster.  Thank you- Candy Feliz< /review>

<Review>I have been getting my lashes done at PRIM Lash & Beauty Studio for 6 months now and I couldn’t be any happier with them! Camille is great!!! She always listens to my concerns and am always beyond satisfied after every appointment. I get a refill every 2 weeks, and I could possibly go longer but I just prefer it that way. The lashes are great quality, no clumps or pre-mature fallouts. This is definitely the place to go!

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>I got Microblading done today by Jani. They look great!! I love, love, love them.  The process was so much easier then I had heard and seen online.
She exceeded my expectation.
I will be recommending Prim Lash & Beauty Studio to all my family and friend.
I will be going back to get my eyelashes done next.
Thank you< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

The place it great. Needs more staff. These guys do miracles & run on fumes. They are great but burnt out. Maintenance is basically MacGyver. Front office juggles so much I can’t understand how these folks remain courteous and smiling. Wish corporate would give them more resources to do a better job.   We love you guys & thank you for trying your absolute best.< /Text>

1st Update on the Maintenance (2/18/21): I ran into a problem with the clogged garbage disposal and submitted a service request via the online portal at 3 pm. The maintenance team was over here the next morning at 9 am and took care of the issue fast and in a very professional manner while I was working behind my desk. I would add another star for this experience if I could :)

I'm very happy to live at Bella Vista as my first apartment building in the LA area. I moved a few days ago from Chicago and had a hassle free experience working through everything online, from a virtual tour to signing the lease while being thousands of miles away, and throughout the whole process Marjorie from the leasing office was the best agent I could wish for, so I wanted to deerly thank her here again! This is a beautiful and peaceful community with amazing amenities and friendly neigbors.

p.s. this review will be updated ...< /Text>

Many thanks to Adriana Solomon!!! I got approved here and decided to go with a different community. Through it all Adriana was very kind and understanding of my decision and indecisiveness. She let me know that she was there if I needed anything or had any questions. The grounds of this place are my favorite out of all the apartment communities I've visited. It is absolutely beautiful!!!! I love just driving up into Bella Vista. Unfortunately, I found more upgrades and square footage for a better price at a different community.</text>

<Review>I have lived at Bella Vista for almost 9 years. I am very happy here. I’ve had very few problems in all these years. I especially want to give a shout out to Daniel Pupp from the Maintenance Department. He has always responded quickly and professionally. He gives me great information on how to prevent certain problems. And the rest of the Maintenance Department is great, too. Very professional people. Also want to give a shout out to Kevin Torres from the leasing office. He has been great helping me out on various issues. I love it here and plan to make this my home for many more years.<//Review><user_id>109217320757576070615</user_id>< name>

My roommate and I moved into the Bella Vista apartments recently. The apt is so quiet and comfortable, it feels so homey.  Having a washer and dryer in the unit is so convenient too!
They keep the building and the surrounding area around the apartments so clean and orderly.
Our home is so close to everything including my gym La Fitness .
I’m am so happy to have found a wonderful home at the Bella Vista apartments!! Home sweet home for sure! 🏠</Text>

<Review>Bella Vista has been my home for last 2 years and overall I've had an amazing experience! Amenities are well kept, staff is always friendly (shout out Kevin and Jovan!) and maintenance always takes care of you! They also have food trucks that come by on Wednesdays, which is extremely convenient for days when you have no time to cook! Really happy that I choose this place as my home!

Just wanted to give kudos to Daniel, one of the maintenance team for always helping me out! He always takes care of my problems efficiently, carefully, and explains the process to his work! Really knowledgeable guy!

Thank you Bella Vista!<//Review><user_name>Marc Louie Aquino</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Worst customer service . Not worth for the price.. seems to be all fake positive reviews. No one answers the phone irrespective how many times you tried. You  will find a lot of cheaper units in the neighborhood with better service

The response from the management is standard copy and paste text. You can see yourself for all the other reviews. They don’t care at all. Only time try will care when no one shows interest in the property and it’s a good way to teach them a lesson about value of tenants and humans< /Review>

The experience of this place is great entirely because of the staff, who not only keep the place up to a very high standard in terms of cleanliness and fixing any problems with the amenities. Between the high quality of the apartment complex’s amenities and the kind and supportive staff, This has been my favorite place to live.<//Review>< UserId.>

12.10.19 - update.
After living there for 2 yrs I can say that the place is nice but the service there is horrible. If something or any appliances stop working it take then 3 days or more to come and fix it. Sometimes they are doing a bad repair job and when you call them again about it there answer is it is what it is and we can't fix it this is the way it need to be. Like really?
The rent going up every year by $250 although they will tell you when you sign, not to be worry it will not go up a lot or that you can ask to reduce it (which they never do).
In the last year there are a lot of homeless people and break-in here, the storage units that I have here someone tried to break in but I caught it on time even though I told the office about it, it took them more than two weeks to fix the door.
They give you the field that just pay your rent and don't bother us we don't care that you have a problem around the house.
I'm definitely not going to recommend anyone about this place lucky for me it would be my last year here.

We just moved here from NJ and we love it here. Everything clean, great neighbors as far as we saw, amazing guys at the office that try to help and fix any problem fast.<//text>

Avoid this place as much as possible!
1. They have no learning center to use computers, printers or fax or copy.
2. The leasing office never answers their phone.
3. The rent is ridiculously sky rocketed just so they can pay off their precious leasing office renovation.
4. The gate alarms are always broken.
5. Oh and The Fire Alarm rings constantly on certain days! the most annoying sound you'll ever hear making you want to rip your ears off. It's going off as I am writing this review.

Consider yourself lucky for seeing this review before you sign a lease you'll regret.

Oh and I forgot....BUGS everywhere!!!<//Text>

<Text>We are new residents and moved in 12/1/18. We encounter quite few problems that is impacting our quality of life.

Cons:
- Key fob do not work properly for new residents. I do not have access to any amenities ( Gym, Sauna, Pool). Most importantly, I don't even have access to get into the parking lot. This problem has been going on for over a week. I come home late and I can't even get inside...it's really is inconvenient to residents.

-Delay of maintenance- Make sure to request it online and do not just rely on staff's word that they would follow through with your request. Maintenance are also not detail oriented.

- The shower room for women's near the gym does not work. If you want to shower after the gym...it's been broken for weeks.

Pros:
-Quite
- Property appear to be well maintained< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1544723974343, 'text': 'Hello, Wanda\n\nWe’re sorry to hear this.

Kevin was so helpful and informative. He made moving in and getting all of my documents together very easy. Definitely went above and beyond to answer all of my questions and concerns. Mike from maintenance was great too! Took care of all my service needs within the hour and was very thorough and clean about the job as well.  THANK YOU KEVIN & MIKE!!!!! :)< /review>

Bella vista is great. Great parking, with easy access to my apartment. Renting the apartment was quick and easy, and the apartment staff were really helpful and kind. I had some issues with my sink but maintenance came quickly as soon as I moved in, and fixed it right away. It's my very first apartment and the experience has been great so far.<//text>

Bella vista is a beautiful place to live in however their practices are kind of shady. They advertise on their website that you would get $400 off your rent(select apartments) but then you find out that this is supposed to be off your security deposit if you get approved right away without the need for further verification.
I applied  and they had to to verify everything from asking me to bring in my ID to the office, then to my income which I provided an offer letter for my new job with my annual salary, then they asked for 6 months worth of bank statements and that was very frustrating. I have perfect credit and have rented with this company for 3 years without a single problem. Why did they have to screen me like I was an 18 year old who was renting for the first time.< /Text>

Well I’m glad I did, and I must say I couldn’t be happier. The people who work here are great they all deserves five stars and if I could give them more I would. So THANK YOU for all you do and for making the transition to my new two bedroom so easy. Thank you Kevin and Rana you guys are very professional and so attentive to all my needs

So if you want to live in an amazing beautiful place surrounded with great people this is the place for you. This place sure does deserve the benefit of the doubt.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><response>{'time': 1535731416428, 'text': "Hello and thank you so much for sharing this with us!\n\nIt's an absolute pleasure to have you as a member of the Bella Vista community.

My husband and I moved in to Bella Vista recently. We were welcomed with the warmest and most professional team. We are both professionals and work long hours therefore had special requests as for the location of our unit. Jovan and Keven both worked with us and as a result of their excellent team work and effort we were able to choose the best available unit to meet our expectations. We absolutely love our place and highly recommend to those who are looking for a great place to live. Nelly<//Review>

I have been living here for 5 years and as the years are gone by the office staff and the care is getting worst. The building lobbies are extremely dirty with spider webs, trash water, dog #1 and #2. and so on. I called office and reported and asked the property manager to please ask the lobbies to be washed and never happened. Recently my refrigerator broke and water in the middle of kitchen I reported and took finally 5 days with me screaming in the office to have someone changing the refrigerator. To them is not priority. A young lady in the office made faces and rudely said I am not talking to you because i am 8 months pregnant. My answer was I will report your rude attitude towards tenants. No one is really happy the cost is high and have no manners and not enough maintenance staff. DONT RENT HERE AND WASTE YOUR MONEY.<//Text>

<Text>I will not even give one star & will not recommend this place. When we first moved in the apt was filthy with dirt. I had to re-clean the entire place. The laundry unit was layer with dirt and there was bunch hair got stuck on the racks. After mopped the floors, the water was beyond black. Just recently there were dead bees and it took them months to come clean. The stairs got nothing but spider webs & black widows hidden in between.

< review>
I have been living in Bella Vista for over 10 years plus. I have had many different experiences with many managers and Mayra is aboustly wonderful. Martin is great he makes sure to always keep the community functioning. Kevin in the office gives great customer service. I also want to thank Jessie for always a being so  helpful. I cannot thank Alfonso for all his hard work he has provided over the many years. Last I want to mention Jovan, he always goes the extra mile and is a joy to have at the community.  😀< /review>

<Time>1547175618046<//Time><user_name>Ms. Rostami</user_name><Pictures>None<//Pictures><text>Recently my parents wanted to see if they could go back to Bella where they used to live. After talking to a leasing agents Chaqya, they found the unit they liked. My parents are old with excellent credit score but don't have any income. I have always applied for them as their guarantor. We have NEVER missed a payment. I have great credit history and income to qualify for any of the Bella Vista units. After I spoke to Chaqya face to face at Bella Vista to apply for the apartment, she told me that it was after 5:00 pm and my parents should go there the next morning for the process of applying. I told her that I have to be their guarantor and she said it is fine as long as we qualify. I asked her what of someone apply before us until the next morning and she assured me that won't happen. The next day my parents went there to get the application started and she told them that I have to apply online. Since I was at work I called her to get the online information and she told me that the apartment has another applicant. I was surprised and said that she assured me the night before that won't happen after my complaint she said let me call you back maybe they don't qualify. She called me back 10 minutes later saying the other applicants didn't qualify and we are good to go. She emailed me links to online application and told me to add everyone who will live in the unit plus myself as a guarantor on the application. I did and emailed her the confirmation. I also paid $188 for all of our credit checks plus $600 deposit. She emailed back saying it all seems good and asked for my paystubs, copy of DL, and my employer information. Plus she wanted to verify my mom's SS card in person. So she asked me to go with my mom to the office and since she was going to be out of the office for couple of days said that anyone in the office can verify that. So I took my mom on the same day and showed up at their office where I was told by another agent Jovani that they do not allow guarantor for more than one person and that one individual has to be a college student. My parents are clearly not college students and more than one person. Clearly I was surprised and he suggested to cancel the application and I said as long as I will get my money back. If I knew that they do not allow guarantor for anyone other than one student WHY would I apply????
So, they said they don't know and they will put the request for refund. It is over a month later and after several visits, emails, and phone calls with that office I have received the $600 back but not the $188 credit check. I do understand that the credit checks are non refundable usually BUT we wouldn't have applied if Chaqya didn't give me the wrong information. I am in the process of filing to sue them in small claim court. Every time I went to their office there were several people complaining about different things and their agents were like robots with no real care for their tenants and clients. It is so sad to see big corporations running their business like this. I found out later that Chaqya is new and had no idea about their policies. Also this policy of not accepting guarantor is not mentioned ANYWHERE!!! Not brought up by their agents and not on their application. Their online program allows to add more than one person who are not students in addition to a guarantor. I have been a tenant, landlord, and home owner and I have never been treated poorly by an organization. Charging $2300 for a 1 bed 1 bath apartments, you would think at least they treat you fairly. I strongly recommend that you look elsewhere if you are thinking about living there. There are many beautiful buildings in that neighborhood with way better management. Also their office staff is constantly out of office. The sign on their glass door says back at 1:00 pm when it is already 2:30 pm and no one to be found in the office. People from Time Warner and postal service usually are looking for someone who can let them in or help them. I will definitely write an update after I take them to court for $188.<//text>< GmapID>

I’ve never written a review before but I am so moved by how patient and kind everyones has been to us.
I have special health concerns so finding a place felt near impossible.
They graciously worked hard making it all go right.
Special thanks to Celina Romero, Kevin,
Jovan, Manager Steve and Services Manager Martin.
My gratitude could fill the sky.
Your fans,

<user>113853072828289901114</user><Rating>1< /Rating><review>Firstly, in the recent past I have lived at Bella Vista for two years, one in a two bedroom apartment and the other in a three bed, and seen multiple changes in management and leasing staff, so I can state with authority that this place is going down hill very fast. I considered moving back to Bella Vista and gone through there application process; however, became very aware of the poor customer service and the lack of maintenance staff to service requests in a timely manner. I never raise my voice or attack individuals as I know that sometimes you have to do things that are not always your choice! That said, the ability and reaction of the leasing team to turn on you is staggering. I have seen on other reviews about how thin skinned and superficial the team is, now I can confirm that is true. I now know why Bella Vista has so many openings. I do not recommend this place unless you don't plan on interacting with the leasing office and do all your own maintenance.< /review>< Pics>

I have lived at bella vista for almost 3 years. The residents are very hospitable and friendly. For the most part the grounds are livwly and well cared for. The office personnel are friendly and are easy to work with. The maintenance department is fantastic. Work orders take no time to be remedied. All the crew are formidable.. However daniel pupp who recently fixed a leak in my fridge wss a stand out! He was clean and a complete gentleman. He fixed the problem rapidly and cleaned everything including re loading my fridge. He explained what gad happened and showed me how to prevent it from reoccuring. He is very knowledgeable and i appreciated his wisdom and care.   Robin<//review>

NO SAFTY! RUN AWAY!

DON'T BE FOOL BY THE VIEW! DONT WAIST YOUR TIME & MONEY!

NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PROPERTY!

Lived here for more than 6 months. Can’t wait to leave even before the lease is over!

We thought this place is quite and gated but no, we were so wrong.

The front gate is not working properly and often remains open.

No serious security or any cameras installed in the parking structures.

So many break-ins to the resident's cars & units.

My car was vandalized recently so as other 6 neighbor cars. found my new car with 4 flat/punctured tires and ended up paying $1300 for a new set.

We don’t feel safe here at all.

The staff never answer the office phones!! Don’t bother talking to them!

Dishonest, Disrespectful & Very Rude

Leasing Manager/ Assistance Property Manager (Katie).

The building structure is very poor & flimsy, the walls and doors are so thin. You can even hear other neighbors phone calls! Now imagine a noisy & loud

family with 3 huge dogs or toddlers & new born are leaving above you! It’s like an earthquake BOOM BOOM...running, screaming, shutting doors and of-course nonstop crying. (just because of the poor structure)

I’m not blaming anything on the residences…the problem is the Bela Vista management & community rules. Noisy and crowded families/ residences

should move in to lower levels.

Water heater is half of the size of the other community properties. You can’t fill up 2 hot water bathtubs at the same time. (In a two bath unit)

Never had these problems in the past 16 yrs living in this area.

Will never recommend this community property!<//Review>

Move-in process was fairly smooth. The entire staff was exceedingly accommodating, and was sure to resolve any questions I had about the unit prior to rental.

During the pre-move-in walk-through, the person helping me spotted stuff that I didn't see (I'm fairly new to the rental market) and made sure I noted it properly on the pre-move-in paperwork

Upon moving in, I found that everything we noted had been taken care of, but my hot water wasn't working... however, they fixed it the moment I alerted them to the issue.

Minor hiccough aside, I couldn't recommend working with these folks enough!<//text>

Well our year of hell in this place is almost up!!!

We had to call the courtesy patrol twice last night for the noise from the neighbors we've been fighting with for a year now. Still didn't do any good since the neighbors just ignore everyone and kept rocking out till early morning.

The noise started up this morning and after 2 phone calls, 3 emails and pounding on the neighbors door it still blasting through our wall 6 hours later!

Imagine living in a so-called "luxury" apartment and being forced to use ear plugs each night just to go to sleep!

Management considers nothing your neighbors do a nuisance. Music blaring 14 or more hours a day? No problem, they are enjoying their apartment and music and you have to put up with it.

Imagine having to go and rent a motel room to get piece and quiet, we've had to do this a number of times.

I'm not talking a little noise once in a while, I talking thumping bass starting before 6:00am and going well past midnight most nights! Oh, and this goes on for days and weeks without a break!

The one thing to keep in mind if you wish to rent here, if you have a problem before the 30 days are up you should seriously consider moving before the time is up! The management team will do nothing to help you after the 30 days and their only solution is for you to move out but you will have to buy out your full lease.

Finally, do not communicate with the office over the phone, they will tell you a call never happened because they have no record of it. Only use email and make sure you keep copies to protect yourself!!!<//text>

I loved the place. Only thing is that they did not give me the home because i did not have a rental history. Which means that I have never rented a place before. Since i have not rented a place before, i couldn't get the house. SO IF YOU HAVE NEVER RENTED A PLACE BEFORE, DONT HEVEN BOTHER CALLING!!!</text>

Jovan was absolutely a wonderful way to first visit the lovely waterfall front on top of the hill Bella Vista Apartments. It’s many heated pools and lovely smiling neighbors really made it feel like a sense of friendly upbeat community. The staff is very quick and fast to repond to absolutely any questions you may have and their is so many more surprises coming up like the new renovations being made and cheerful events being posted. The environment is very inviting and I can’t wait to really see all it has to offer. My apartment is very bright and lovely. The most amazing part is the absolutely big insensitive. Your rent could go to the equity of your future home or business. Please Call Jovan for details. You won’t regreat stoping by this grandiose retreat I now call home.<//review>

I cant wait till my lease is up!

Gated community my arse! the left wing gates are always broken and open (4 months now), even seen the gates hit nice Mercedez and just destroy the paint on them (Bella Vista of course has no security cams on gates, so they are not responsible for damages).
Security Guards are a joke!!!!, they walk around smelling daisies and harassing with unwanted conversation to the point that I have to be rude and tell them to shut up and stop talking. They avoid big, crowded scenes (especially when they are rowdy)- isn't this what they are supposed to take care of, lol.

Subsidized living!- More and more I have noticed this place take in people with "ghetto" backgrounds. They are loud, disrespectful, have no boundary respects and think they still live in Pacoima/Downtown.

*My 19 year old sister had a black MAN MID-30'S harass her until she gave him a fake number about a house party that was going on, poolside, no security present (main children's pool btw). I thought they checked for this type of behavior. Now I feel like I need to present with her at all times when she is enjoying the pool.

*Another event- we had a incident happen where another disorderly man was LITERALLY TRYING TO KICK OUR DOWN DOWN, called security, nothing happened then called the cops to take care of the situation, I HAD TO STEP OUT, AND CONFRONT THIS RANDOM MAN MYSELF TO TELL HIM TO LEAVE AS THE COPS WERE ON THEIR WAY AND I SAW 2!!! TWO!! 1+1=2!!! SECURITY GUARDS SITTING IN THEIR ELECTRIC CART. chilling.

HOWEVER!- cleaning crew, and room maintenance people are always on spot. Yes, it is a large place so keeping up can get hard when dogs are marking every wall. But I do get up at odd hours of the crack of dawn and I see the cleaning crews busting their ass, So Bella Vista is doing that right.

I wouldnt be surprised if my tires get punctured/vandalized after I post this. 8/9/2015
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, I am about to move in. Reading all the reviews a bit late, I feel they are "baiting and snatching" me. We were promised one unit, 7 days before our move in date, they tell us we cant move in (after reservation, holding deposits and a month ahead of moving date.) Then they try giving me a horrible view, worn down apt that fits my moving date, as a nicety, telling me its a much more expensive unit ( i guess vintage?, lol). So, i bite the bullet and opt for a larger unit, more expense, and i cant even see it, but "it will be available to move in within 2 days". Lets see what happens now. Ill probably make a specific blog for this place alone.

i have to say, staff is nice, the place looks clean, and quiet. Ill update within my 30 day guarantee, thats if they dont decide to keep my deposit and bring me ridiculous charges as i have been reading.

I purchased study materials and tests from few different schools and I ended up using only materials from Contractors State License School.  Other schools didn't have enough info. These materials covered everything that was in the actual exam!  Don't waste your money on other study materials.
Buy them from Contractors State License School  and you'll everything you need to pass the exam. Ask for Craig Clivans, he helped me purchasing the books and tests in a very timely manner.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>I’m going to be honest. I was a bit scared to make the jump but after calling and talking to Julio Avila they really made things so much easier to understand. He explained everything in detail and answered all my questions. He had a great attitude and was very respectful even when I asked him to explain things over one more time. He hooked me up with a promotion wished me luck and sent me on my way. I’m exited to start and hopefully get my license ASAP. Let’s do this!!!<//text>< pics>

<text>I have nothing but great things to say about this school. From the moment I decided to enrolled all the way until the end. I went to my online classes and the instructors are very helpful. At the time of my application submission Juliette Macksoud at The Lawndale school helped me with even the most random questions. I have nothing but appreciation to my instructors and Juliette. I strongly recommend the school. Classes are interactive, the books are very helpful. Overall a great experience</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

I had a great experience getting all the information I needed before signing up. Julio Avila from the Van Nuts location helped me through the whole registration process and answered all my questions. I would highly recommend this program if you are interested in getting your contractors license.<//review>

Mr. Avila was very informative, clear with instructions as well as answers as to how to achieve maximum learning and performance from this program.  Definitely would recommend this to individuals who are self disciplined and need little to no guidance to meet their goal.  Once materials have arrived and the actual learning experience has commenced, more reviewers will be posted to give further information to future interested individuals.  As of now, the best is not to be discouraged. Partner up with a mentor so that you also receive one on one guidance while studying for your exam.  Good luck!!<//text>

I speak with her almost weekly needing some sort of a Certificate, or a bond, or insurance. She's helped me with claims and also finding out information for me to obtain my T1 Cal osha Permit. Her attitude and responsiveness helps my business run smoothly and she is an amazing representative of her company. CSLS also helped me obtain my C42 License which was great, though Debra has made it so that I continue my business with the company due to her guidance and professionalism, I would not be where I am today without her help .If you need anything Debra is just an email or call away, you will not be disappointed if you contact her directly for all you insurance needs.< /text>< GmapID>

Prior to today I’ve been collecting information about acquiring my General Contractors license and let me add all those other places had me feeling like they just wanted my $$ and not put any effort in engaging in trying to get to know my goals and how far I want to go with my decision !!! Well long story short !! Thanks Julio Avila!! This schools need more people like u who listen and reminds u that this is the first step to accomplishing my goal !! Any Contractor School who hire this man shows not only that they care about the image  of their school but speaks high volumes of what to expect as a student !! Sign me on !!!<//review>

The next day, I spoke with Peggy Burdick, a administrative counselor.  She was wonderful! She explained how the school works, and answered all of my questions quickly. She made so comfortable talking to her, I feel that I've made a new friend. I feel that this whole school, and especially Peggy, is geared toward success,  and they are going to help, in any way, to help me achieve my goal of becoming a contractor.  I highly recommend this program for anyone looking for this type of training. Thanks for everything! Sincerely,  James Randall.</Text>< pictures>

It's a really great and reliable service these guys provide! I was fortunate enough to be helped by Alissa Ramirez, she really did a great job walking me through the whole process! I just passed my exams 2 days ago and now I'm ready to send all my info to receive my license and Alissa is still helping me getting my corporation started! So they will help you before and after you pass your tests!
Thank you Alissa! :)< /Review>

Do your self a big favor and stay away from this school!!!
I signed up for the C-10 back in June 2020, due to Covid I was promised to have a crash course online, as I told Diego who signed me up the date of my upcoming exam he disappeared on me, him and the entire company, when I asked for a refund I was told that Miriam from accounting will call me, needless to say, she never did. After I failed my test, I called them again and fell for the second trap, after they promise me that I'll have an online crash course. That didn't happen either!!!
The worst think is their customer service, once they get your money, you can forget about them. I had to call Diego from another line for him to pick up the phone, I left so many massages and never heard back.
Simply a disgrace!!!</Text>

I worked with Pegi Burdick directly to ultimately reactivate my General Contractors Class-B license. She was more than helpful and always available for my phone calls regarding materials, test timing and of course the $$$. She made the process as easy as it could be. This process is highly recommend to any new GC or an old pro looking to dust off the skill saw and get back in the game.
Thanks again and Cheers to you Mrs. Burdick!< /text>

If your seriously looking to get your Contractor’s license call Alyssa ..... she will help guide you through the process... the rest is on you... study hard and the test will be simple... you have 4 hours to take the test and I did it less than 30 minutes.💪🏽< /Text>

I had a great experience with Pegi Burdik at CSLS
She was so knowledgable and friendly.. She got right to the point and answered all my questions. If you are interested in finding out about getting your first or your fifth contractors license she is the one to speak with.

Making that phone call to the Contractors State License School was the best decision I have made.  I was nerves to call, but when Pegi was on the other end, everything changed.  She eased my anxiety and she provided me with all of the information I needed to enroll my brother and a friend  for their Contractor's License.  Oh, I also decided to enroll in a Blue Print Reading course starting October 31,2020.  I can't wait to begin!!  Pegi, your kindness is immensely appreciate.  I value the help you have given me and my family.

So, for those out there who are ready to take the next step in your career, I highly recommend to call Pegi.  She's the one!!!!< /text>

At this point, I have only signed up for classes, but so far Pegi has been very welcoming and helpful in getting me started. Really looking forward to getting my C-10 electrical license. I'll post another review once the process is over to update my experience.</Text>

Amazing experience! I pass my exam on 1st time. They prepare good materials, including audio and video CD. Classes with Nick was very helpful! After this classes book becomes understandable. He give us a lit of tricks how to memorize materials and successfully pass the exam.
Then administrator Elena on reception desc was very helpful! Guiding step-by-step in each process of paperwork it gives you confidence in what you doing!
So my experience with this school is amazing! Highly recommended!!!<//Review>

<Review>Elena and Alyssa are amazing! They literally helped me every step of the way and are so amazing to work with. I’m so thankful for them at this school.

The study prep material they give you is pretty good to. I highly recommend taking Nick for law and trade (try and take crash course closest to your exam date really helps)

They don’t teach you trade besides giving you course material because you’re supposed to know it already ... so if you need to brush up look in the books. That being said the study material they give you for the trade is super helpful. Just a heads up some of it goes really into detail when it’s not super necessary, so don’t stress it too much<//Review>< user_name>

<text>Alyssa Ramirez was just about the most helpful person I’ve ever encountered, representing any school, anywhere. My Teachers were top notch and I had nothing but the best experience, all around, in dealing with CSLS. Y’all rock ! Thanks so much for helping achieve something I’ve been planning on doing for 30 years, with ease !
Very sincerely,

So i really had a great experience with this school. Had some bumps on this long journey personally for me. But i finally did it and did not give up. School was very helpful and the practice exams helped me tremendously. Just want to say not to give up if you fail exam keep going like I did. Thank you also to Lydia Sobalvarro for the guidance and my bond. JF</Text>

Hello, potential contractors this is a student of CSLS recently, I have been in the trades for over 15yrs and going to make the move to become a contractor this decision doesn't come lightly i could have just fill my application , take the test with the state but wait this isn't something you should do without knowledge. One bright and educated individual by the name Pegi Burdick helped me make a decision on becoming a smarter tradesman on business and law of the trade which will help me navigate through the paper work jobs will demand.  The information, CDs, packet of study guides and well put binder will help me succeed all I have to do is apply myself and if I need any questions answered  Pegi Burdick does a  wonderful job getting that information and point you in the next step of the process. I do recommend this school before you do it yourself you don't want to go blind into this business of trades.<//review>

The staff were really friendly and informative. The information given to you is very straight forward and easy to learn. All the material provided is there to help you pass your exams and you passing will depend on you studying or not. Alyssa at the front counter was very and I can not stress enough how helpful she was to me. From start to finish she assisted me in all of my paperwork and made things easy to grasp. I highly recommend this school. Alyssa also deserves a raise.<//text>

I needed to understand how to be able to get a GC license and I was helped by Pegi who clearly explained to me many different options. She helped me understanding pricing, processes, procedures and enrollment program.She was super professional as well as nice and friendly. Great experience overall. Strongly suggested.<//Text>

trying this again since normally i dont do this. But would like to say that this school was a big help to me and especially my family. Finally passed my exams after a long journey it was not easy for me but finally DID IT!. Great school, practice exams helped alot for me, the van nuys school counselors are great and Thank you to my counselor Lydia S. for giving me the confidence to enroll into the school and the $1195 that i paid was well worth it and the help on my insurance.  Comign back to you for my Painting license.< /review>

The girls who work this front of the building are so incredible! They help you every step of the way and are always motivating you to get everything done in a timely manner while guiding you all along the way. I am very pleased with the overall experience as well as the classes and instructors. Believe me, its a process to become a contractor and luckily you have the support system to help you get through it.

A very special thank you to Alyssa Ramirez who put up with all of the obstacles I faced in this journey and always helped me every step of the way. She is very kind and is always on top of everything even if you yourself become careless. Alyssa helped me out so much and I am very happy I had the ability to progress the necessary requirements I needed in order to get me to pass my exam and get licensed. I am forever greatful and I will always support CSLS and their wonderful staff but of those most importantly the shining star of CSLS, Miss Alyssa Ramirez!<//Text>

Shopped around for contracting schools before settling on CSLS.  Pegi Burdick was my contact at CSLS.  She was informative, patient, and pleasant.  I called several times and every single time, she was available to take my calls and answer my questions.  CSLS may not be one of the most inexpensive but their experience, knowledge, and customer service is well worth the price.<//review>

I had a great experience at CSLS while preparing to take the General  Contractor B test, which I passed on the first time. Due mainly to the great staff there in preparing me with the right material's  and the format to study for the two exams I took,  which were the  Trade and Law courses for General Contractor B license.  The two people who really stood out with their professionalism and where incredibly helpful and supportive in preparation for the  exam's were Alyssa and Lydia, these  two are the best and I can't them enough. Just listen to what they have to say and study, study, and study , because all the material that's needed is there to pass any test they throw at you.<//Text>

Pegi is extremely knowledgeable, helpful, friendly and personable. She has always answered any call that I have made to her and takes the time to make sure all of my questions are answered. My exam date is at the end of this month and I feel confident that I will pass with flying colors. -Mike West< /Review>< resp>

I Jared Starr had an outstanding experience. I passed my first set of exams and am using the school again for my corporation and another exam. Pegi Burdick has been beyond helpful I can't say enough. The entire experience has been a pleasure. I would definitely recommend the school to anyone I know looking to take the state contractor exam.</Review>

My name is Creole Walker and I just enrolled with Contractors State License School today. I had the absolute pleasure of meeting and speaking with Pegi Burdick who assisted me with the whole process. She kindly put down her lunch to take care of me and did so with graciousness and a wonderful sense of humor! Pegi made me feel at ease and confident in my success, mainly because she assured me of her unending support and commitment to me becoming licensed. Thank you Pegi, for a wonderful beginning to this journey!< /Text>

Just want to acknowledge CLS and their instructors. They had all the materials I needed and It was well worth my time and money because initially I didn’t know what to expect and really wasn’t sure if I could do it. But I passed the test on the first round. Well worth it!!!</review>

I was recommended by few friends to contact CSLS for help in acquiring my general B. I can’t tell you how glad I am that I did. Pegi Burdick has been so helpful with all my questions and concerns around the process. She has simplified The steps so you don’t get overwhelmed.

I highly recommend CSLS to everyone looking to take the next step to getting there license.< /review>

<text>I called this school over a year ago.  Pegi told me everything I needed to know and I was just to scared to invest in myself/company.  I held off, never forgetting the conversation that I had with Pegi.  I remained focused on growing my business and when I was ready I couldn't find her contact info.  I was so ready that I reached out to a different school to inquire and possibly enroll.  The experience I had with the enrollment advisor at the other school DID NOT compare.  The rapport built in that first call with Pegi had set the expectation and nothing else would do.  I spent the last month hunting down notes, going through phone records, and going through emails to find her.  Her knowledge base is unmatched and you can tell that she genuinely cares.< /text>< Pictures>

When I initially called to ask about the program I wasn’t able to do it, but Pegi took the time to call me back several months later. She walked me through everything and has been very encouraging and helpful. I really appreciate all the time she takes to explain things over the phone and how quickly she emails me what I need.

Got a hold of CLCS and spoke to a very friendly person - Pegi- she helped me every step of the way towards getting me set up for my contractor license exams and related information.

Pegi was very informative and answer all my CSLB questions,
To be honest what made me choose this school verses two others,  was the customer support and friendly staff that I spoke too, Pegi was very thorough and  very professional.

I highly recommend this school to anyone wanting to prep for state and trade exam to get your contractor license, it’s worth the $$$

Absolutely loved the informative one on one with Pegi! She opened doorways that I thought we closed since 2017. Professional, profound, and empowering women. Dont be afraid to act today by investing into yourself.<//Text>

Pegi is the real deal, she genuinely looks out for your best interests and helps guide the best path for your individual needs.  She helped me with some tough questions and decisions, and made the whole process easy and efficient.  And she always makes herself available if you run into any speed bumps along the way.

I was not expecting this level of customer service from a contract licensing school, but have been very pleasantly surprised by how great every one affiliated with the school has been so far!<//text>

<text>Can’t say enough but this company and Alyssa have done it again 16 years ago they helped me in getting my c-8 and c-29. Today after a month they once again did their job again I passed with ease my c-53 so I’m very happy for the way the school is set up to succeed. Thank you to you all 😊😊< /text><Rate>5< /Rate>< Name>

I called to inquire about getting my contractors license and was transferred to Pegi. She took the time to explained to me the entire process and options available. I signed up that day and 2 weeks later I was taking my first class. My classes where in the long beach location and the instructor Bill was great. Had lots of energy and kept it fun which was a good since the classes are at 630pm and after a full day of work it kept the energy in the room live and awake. I'm currently waiting for my test date but feel prepared and Pegi has always been available to answer my questions and help me along the way.< /text>

<Text>I have to stop and recognize Alyssa Ramirez at Contractor State License School, Van Nuys Ca location. She was a huge help in assisting me to pass my exam.  She answered all of my questions along the way, in detail. She was never too busy to stop and clarify something that I needed help with. In addition, she was encouraging and always had a positive attitude. Very hard to find these days. She always returned my phone calls within a very reasonable amount of time, which is very important to me. This  company’s mission is to make contractors out of qualified personal, and Alyssa exemplifies this in everything she does for her clients. Thank you Alyssa for everything you do!<//Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

<text>I recently passed my Gen B law and trade exam. My experience at CSLS was crucial to my passing the exams and obtaining my qualification. Lydia & Alyssa were super helpful, professional and personable and we're incredibly knowledgeable and helpful though a very meticulous application and exam process. Any business or organization is only as good as the people you come into direct contact with and Lydia and Alyssa were incredible and integral to my obtaining my lofty goals.  I couldn't be happier with the training I received at the school and the guidance by the staff.</text><Gmap_id>0x80c2977302227127:0x96d95c1c63c80271<//Gmap_id>< Resp>

I'm very fortunate to have been put in contact with Peggy Burdick. I had called CSLS to gain some information about obtaining my general contractors license. Peggy is an absolute gift to this school! The amount of information she provided me with was astonishing.  At no point did I ever get an "I don't know" or "I'll have to transfer you to someone else who can assist you". She had all the answers. Impeccable doesn't fully describe Peggy.  I'm at a loss for words to describe how truly grateful I am for her. I appreciate everything that she has done, is doing, and I'm sure if needed, will continue to do to help me in getting my license. More importantly,  I appreciate her! Thank you for being you Peggy! I could ramble on about how awesome and helpful she is, but I'm sure I'm not the only one and I definitely wont be the last person to show appreciation where it's due! Peggy, without you I would be lost throughout this process!</review>

I enrolled in the class with a little hesitation but soon was comforted by Alyssa. She guided me every step of the way and was very patient with my inability to comprehend the order of which everything that needed to happen. She was very helpful in explaining everything in detail and setting everything up to start my business. I passed both the law and trade for my B license on the first try and it was due to the schooling. I enrolled in the in class and crash course (taken the days before my test) and passed.

I did research on other schools but liked the support from this one. I highly recommend.</review>

Pegi was able to help me get my class and always willing to help me in an way possible, she responds to calls and email at a very timely matter. I will expand my business through the classes offered here at contractors state licensing schools.</review>

<Text>The CSLS Van Nuys campus was great to work with they encouraged their students to study and help each student navigate the myriad paperwork and forms required to secure a contractor's license. I was lucky enough to deal with Alyssa Ramirez, a Student Administrator, who was absolutely fantastic to work with. Alyssa was positive and encouraging and a tremendous help getting through the process. I passed the test on the first try and I am waiting for my license to arrive in the mail!< /Text>< pictures>

I've been working with Pegi off and on for the past year.  First off she talked me off the ledge over a year ago when I told her I was a working mom with 2 little kids that I didn't have time to pass the exam.   She told me what to do, I took the school classes, and passed the first time.  Then after obtaining the license, I wanted to set up another organization and had questions on how to do that with the same License.  Of course Pegi knew step by step what to do, and even offered some professional advice counseling.  Of course I will be calling her again to handle all my applications and needs.  I wouldn't trust anyone else!<//review>

<Review>The CSLS Van Nuys campus was great to work with they encouraged their students to study and help each student navigate the myriad paperwork and forms required to secure a contractor's license. I was lucky enough to deal with Alyssa Ramirez, a Student Administrator, who was absolutely fantastic to work with. Alyssa was positive and encouraging and a tremendous help getting through the process. I passed the test on the first try and I am waiting for my license to arrive in the mail!<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

She has answers for everything and has consistent follow-thru.

When she told me she had gone to school here 31 years ago. It all made sense why she

knew so much.

And, she is funny.

I'm a contractor in both Nevada and Arizona and was nervous about the Law test with the stricter and sometimes ridiculous laws in Cali.  The school helps you study quickly with online webinar classes and other online study materials.  The school also sends reminders to help you meet deadlines on application steps, etc.  I would highly recommend this school.< /Review>

This school is an amazing educational center. From day one Pegi Burdick Has made it very easy to understand the goals and qualities this institute has for each of their students. She is also very passionate on knowing her students and understanding their goals for the future. For better assistance in obtaining educational gain for success. I would recommend this school to anyone who has drive  and willingness to grow!<//review>

Came to enroll in this school, law classes with instructors are very helpful. The online needs improvement and also materials. The school provides  audio CD & DvD's which that is a bit out dated. Providing study materials on s USB or flash drive would make no sense. Now a days no one owns CD  or dvd players. School counselor Lydia S was great helping me open my corporation,application and final paperwork to get my license. Thank you!!<//Review>

<text>Pegi Burdick provides excellent customer service and is very professional.  I go straight to her for getting all my new crew members EPA/RRP certified, and she's helped me with other classes and certifications, too. with all my vendors, subs, and service providers, I value knowing a real person who can provide quality service when I need it. Pegi consistently makes sure my organization has that support for the services that CSLS provides.< /text>< resp>

<Text>Pegi helped us enroll our son in courses to prepare him for his inspector certification. She was a wealth of information and advice. She even researched questions that she couldn't immediately answer, called us back, and told us what she had discovered.
Pegi has a rare ability to connect with her customers. Her eagerness to help and her professionally competent, personable style made our interactions with her a completely satisfying experience.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

I'm leaving a 5 star review for the 5 star support I have received from Pegi Burdick. As soon I was put in contact with her she has worked around the clock to make sure she's available to answer any questions I have. She's has also been instrumental in making positive progress to my overall dream of becoming a licensed Contractor. I couldn't give enough thanks to all the help I've received from Pegi. Thank You!

The only reason this all worked was because of Pegi Burdick. She was there to walk me through step by step and make sure not a single item was missed while I added another license and started a corporation. Pegi has been quick to respond and an absolute wealth of knowledge.

<text>Amazing experience amazing people! Lydia Sobalvarro was my councilor and let me just tell you she’s amazing! She guided me through the whole process! From step one to the end and more! Only downfall was the communication over the phone! I always had to speak to another representative regarding my questions when I would really want to speak to Lydia! But I understand there are a lot of students maybe she was always busy! But other than that amazing experience I would recommend anyone who wants to become a licensed contractor to apply thru CSLS Van Nuys! Great personnel!<//text></record>

A friend of mine referred me to CSLS. I contact the school and spoke with Peggy Burdick.  Peggy was very positive and helpful with the process of signing up for my contractors license. She was more than willing to answer any of my questions about having a contractors license and the process of getting your license. I would refer anybody who is looking for a contractors license to contact Peggy Burdick.  I also did pass my contractors test on the first try and I am now in business. Thank you very much for all your help. I will continue to do business with CSLS.
Thank you Peggy!!< /text>

I want to say thank you to everyone at CSLS especially Alyssa Ramirez.She was there from the first day I walked into the Van Nuys location to filling out the final paperwork to submit to the CSLB after passing both exams (on the first try). She was always available to answer any questions I had and  advise me of what I needed every step of the way. Alyssa, Thank you again!!
All the instructors were very knowledgeable and presented the information in an easy to understand format that was very similar to the format of the state exams.
All the study material was spot on. Very well organized and a great balance of text and audio. All the tests in the books were great study material in the 3 or 4 days prior to taking the exams.
I completed and passed the law section of the exam in just under an hour and the General B exam in just over an hour and a half. If it wasn't for CSLS, their amazing staff, and the way the study material is laid out I don't think I would have been able to breeze thru both exams the way that I did.

Thank you again to everyone at CSLS

<rating>5< /rating><text>Pegi was my counselor at CSLS and was amazingly helpful in her support and guidance in getting my license. I now have my Contractor's License and am SO GLAD I followed Pegi's suggestions in which course package to get at the school. It made taking the State exams very successful. I passed both exams on the first try. Pegi is fantastic and Alyssa and Lydia at the Van Nuys CSLB school are too. Every time I had a question or concern Pegi would call me back the same day. And if I needed any help with classes or had questions while at the Van Nuys school Alyssa and Lydia were always there to help. Getting my license was the best thing I could have ever done. Thank you Pegi and CSLS!! I will 110% recommend to CSLS to anyone needing a License School to attend< /text>< pictures>

It was over a year ago that I was looking at the school and then I told Pegi that I was not going to take the test.  However Pegi did not give up on me.  She stayed in contact with for over 4 months.  Now that I have decided to take the test Pegi was the first person I thought and called of in making my final decision to enroll at the Contractors State License Schools.  Due to Pegi's pleasant method of staying in contact with me is what lead me to chose Contractors State License Schools.  Now she has imparted to me valuable information on how to study for the test.  I have not taken a test in years and have been avoiding doing this for over 10 years but after speaking with Pegi and sharing my concerns I am now confident that I will successfully pass the tests the first time.  Thanks Pegi<//review>

<text>Pegi Burdick was very helpful and patient when I had a lot of questions before I enrolled. And after enrollment everything went smoothly, from the application process to the classes every step was helped by the school's staff. They have a lot of practice tests which was a huge help because I saw a lot of the same questions on the actual exam. I passed the exam on my first try and am glad I chose CSLS!<//text><Resp>None< /Resp>< Date>

I feel so fortunate to have chosen CSLS (Van Nuys) because I don’t think I would be a general b licensed contractor today if I had done it anywhere else or by myself, even though it seemed like the state board didn’t want me to get licensed, the staff held up by my side till the end, they are all professional, friendly, and informative from the moment you first meet with them, you know you’re in the right place, want to give special thanks to Alyssa, Claudia and Lydia and everyone else who worked directly or indirectly with my case, will re-enroll to get my inspector cert, and in a near future a second license, am greatful for everything!!!< /review>

<text>Working with Pegi Burdick out of the Van Nuys office was off the chart! Not only was she well informed and professional she guided me through the entire process and went above and beyond to make the whole experience a most enjoyable one. Don't be surprised if I come down there in person to meet her and convenience her to come work with me in my contracting business in San Francisco. She is truly 1 in a million. There's just not enough starts to show my true appreciation. To ANYONE who is considering an education with CSLS give Pegi Burdick a call and you will be well on your way to making the big bucks!<//text>< Pics>

You buy a course for over 700.00 they give you a time limit to review the questions then if you miss that deadline it is 50.00 each for you to pay again for something you already paid for.

<text>The worst school,  do not believe when they say you don't pay additional if you don't pass the test the first time, they charge you for every time you want to take a class, they don't teach trade , only law part do not go to this school, they are the biggest liar and if you confront them they just tell you it is how the school system works and nothing you can do about it.</text>< Pics>

<text>So glad we finally tried this place. Great portions at a fair price. When driving into the drive-thru, note that there’s no speaker or microphone to take the order. The order window is to your left just passed the menu board.

I love the Taco Tuesday. Tacos are great and cheap. I didn't like the enchiladas I tried on a different day. However, a lot of people must like them they said they sell a lot of them.</text>

<review>Fantastic taco shop! Can't beat the $1.59 tacos on Tuesday's. I have tried all their meat options at this point and they are all delicious. The owner is super friendly and service is convenient and quick. If you are looking for tasty lunch that doesn't break the bank, this is your spot!< /review>< GmapID>

The food is fantastic! We love everything here but I especially love the super torta and all tacos.  The prices are decent, it's not fast food, it's fresh and delicious so it's not taco bell cheap because the quality is infinitely better. I love that it's a drive thru so I don't have to get out with my 2 little ones in the car during a pandemic. Couldn't recommend this place more!</text>

I have at least 4 Mexican food restaurants between my apartment and this place and this place is by far the best! It is my go to! I eat here at least twice a week. The grilled chicken tacos are the best!

It does take a few minutes to prepare the food but it is 100% worth it! The guy who works the window named Emerson is super sweet and always puts a smile on my face! 5 stars all around!!!</text>

Great food and service! Our burritos were excellent and full of meat, beans, rice, and cheese. They were super accommodating with putting the guac and sour cream on the side as well for my super burrito. We will be back!<//Review>

<review>My first time visiting Rancho Grande Taqueria while on a lunch work break. I do have to say their horchata is top notch quality! Probably one of the best I have ever tried. It's made at their restaurant and it's not artificial. I had a regular burrito there which was good and filling but I probably should have added some pico de gallo. They offered mild and hot sauce. No medium style sauce but I was ok with that. The gal in the window was super friendly, welcoming and helpful when I was making my order. I will definitely come back for more orders soon! Of course for the horchata as well! Highly recommend this great local taqueria!! 🌯 🔥🎉</review><name>James Stillman IV< /name>< resp>

You drive up, order a taco. Drive around, you get a taco.  Or maybe you order 3 carne asada tacos, a side of guac, extra chips, extra salsa. And added a burrito for later. And since you feel guilty, you order a diet coke for your wife.  Things should always be this easy and predictable. Right?</Text>

Emerson is a complete joy to talk too. He's from Brazil and gives out travel tips if you mention you're going to Brazil at some point.The food was exceptionally good. Especially the Steak Tacos. This place has came a long way from a few years ago. This is my new spot.</text>

This is a family shop that makes everything from scratch!

Emerson and his wife (owners) are the kindest people you will likely ever meet.

We bought a house a few blocks from the taqueria a few months ago (11/2019).  They got us thru the hassle of the move by making our lunch and dinners - I don't know how many times.

Been back again and again.  Not a single mistake on any item we highly customized (we are picky).

Emerson told me they just opened around the same time we moved here.  He loves to talk and you will find he has a story for everything.  His wife (only there on a couple of our visits  - got caught up talking and forgot to get her name) is just as friendly.

Food:  Off the hook.

Price: Same

Recommendation: Get anything they have that has refried beans, if you like those.  They are, well...find out for yourself.

Conclusion: Taco Bell is like a block or 2 away.  Forget that!</Text>

<Review>Everything. Is. Amazing.
I keep trying new menu items and everything gets better and better. Nothing bland or boring here. Authentic taste with rich flavors in perfect proportions to compliment each other. And nothing beats $1 Taco Tuesdays!!!! The staff are really friendly and easy to talk to. Add all that to a quick and convenient drive thru pickup and you have an EXCELLENT choice for any meal. WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND.< /Review>< Rating>

I stopped early today for a combo. It was hot and delicious. Very filling. Fresh crispy fried taco shells. Generous meats. Lots of fresh shredded lettuce topped with guacamole and sour cream. Pico de Gallo. Melted cheesy beans and rice. From a drive through!?! Would I go again? Tomorrow.<//text>

First time coming today and I must say it was bomb! I got the quesadilla and steak soft tacos. The taste was great! With one bite you get the juicy steak, fresh cilantro, and more. Packs a great punch with flavor. This place deserves 5 stars for the delicious and fast service and friendly staff!! Would definitely recommend to all!<//text>

The food is delicious and the service is great since management has changed. A young lady greeted me with a smile and was very helpful.</review>

I used to love the tacos.  But on Taco Tuesdays the tacos got smaller.  When they first opened, I loved the tacos. Packed with meat and flavor. Now they are smaller and filled with onions.  Lost my taste for them.  Maybe on that day due to demand, they make them smaller. I did give them 5-star review but now, not so much.<//text>

This spot is 1 of my "go to" places. For lunch it's OUTsTANDing, $1 soft taco Tuesdays are a great way to get acquainted w/the genuinely authentic flavor this "Drive-thru" taqueria offers. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. Everything on the menu tastes like it came from a handed down family recipe. I personally suggest going for anything 'al pastor' . Prices are respectively competitive.< /text>

I decided to try this place again after I heard it is under new management. I had a great experience today. The gentleman at the window was so friendly. And I am happy to say the food was delicious! I ordered a steak chimichanga and their $1 Tuesday soft tacos. Yum! The chimichanga survived the drive home and remained crispy. And I love that it's a drive thru! I'll be back! The new management is doing a great job!

Old review: No one is inside. I live in the valley and drove 25 minutes just to be disappointed. Fix your hours or be there when you say you're open.</text>

The worst Mexican food I have ever had. Beef enchiladas, tough flavorless meat (we prefer ground  beef). 3 Shredded chicken tacos, meat had good flavor, but they do not drain their meat, so all the liquid soaked through the taco shells, completely  fell apart. Could not eat them, saved meat to put in something else. Chicken Super Burrito, was huge, but again too soggy. They do have good chips. haha.</Review>

We had friends saying the place was great, saw the long lines in many occasions and got tricked into trying. The lines are mostly due to inefficient service, with employees trying to do multiple things at the same time. The girls were crossing in front of each other and one ice cream almost ended up on the floor. At one point each one of 3 groups of customers had 1 ice cream each and were waiting for the rest of their orders, and none of the employees was mixing ice cream (not sure where they all went? Seemed like they were not organized at all). That cold stone where the ice cream is mixed with other stuff does not look like the most hygienic thing. The flavor was ok, but I had better, tastier ice cream elsewhere. The waffle was poor quality, definitely had better elsewhere. I don't think the price is justified.< /review><pics>None<//pics><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x808fc09c2bdbeee9:0x87af5ea538b8440a< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is a very nice place to go with friends to have a classic ice cream cone/ cup (or ever alone!) They have a nice assortment of flavors, nothing out of the ordinary. The ice cream was delicious and you can add your own toppings as such, although the employee seemed irritated if we asked a question such as "Does the ice cream have egg?" Overall, good experience.< /Text>

<text>The line here is always crazy long. Sometimes it feels like it isn't worth it. The staff are in fact working very hard though, so I can't say it's laziness. This location is usually quite messy. The staff don't seem to wipe down the tables very often. But the ice cream is always very good.</text>< pics>

Best choice of ice cream ever. I visited this place about 8 years ago with my uncle and i went there again with him. I hadn't seen him in all those years so it was nice to come back and enjoy the same treat again.< /review>

Very hot, almost feels the AC is not working. Due to the temperature, the ice creams were served soft or melted. Asked for Mango but got Mango Yogurt instead. They had no decency to tell the customer that the flavor is not available.<//text>

As the person who purchases the ice cream (for my daughter), I wouldn't say this location nor any other Cold Stone Creamery have a good price/value proposition.  In terms of this particular location, it is a little less crowded and the service is a little better faster than a lot of other Cold Stone Creamery locations, based on length of the waiting line.< /text>

This store is a much larger in comparison to the other cold stone creameries I have been to. The staff were fine and super busy. The waffle was soggy - not crispy or well roasted. That was a great turn off to be honest. Not only mine but all the waffles that we had ordered were not-crunchy and soft.
Once done with the ice cream I head to the restroom and it was super dirty. Surprisingly there were no napkins. The restroom was super un-hygienic and toilet was not flushed and dirty.
Didn't have a great experience - probably not coming back here again.< /text>

It's all good, but the lack of tables results in the lack of cleaning them. It's very dirty, and as a neat freak, I cannot enjoy my ice cream if I eat it there.</text>

Ice cream during winter is my favorite, cold stone has always been the standard for ice-cream in my opinion, it was quite busy but they still manage to crank up the orders and got all of us out the door happy.< /text>

My issues were that I was not greeted right when I walked in the door and the lady did not put on gloves when she scooped my ice cream. She also did not wash her hands either.< /text>

It is in the center of Fremont. So the location is perfect for all. Ice-creams are tasty & melodious like always.< /Text>

<Review>My kids would give it a five star rating.  My 16 year-old daughter loves the 'cake batter' ice cream, and my youngest loves just going out for ice cream PERIOD.  She informed me that all ice cream is good - Baskin Robbins, ColdStone, anything.  As for myself, I find the ice cream too sweet, the store overwhelmingly smelly in a sweet sort of way, and the ice cream texture like Gelato.

The staff is very friendly and helpful and will SING if you give them a tip - so definitely tip.  It's very funny.

Lines can be very long - even on a good day, and move slowly.  But among the best ice cream in Fremont, if you like a sweet gelato style.< /Review>< pictures>

When we went in 20 minutes before close there was a large line, and within those 20 minutes more people arrived which there response was to tell them to leave because they were in line when they closed even tho they were in line before it closed... Some people waited in line 10 min before and were asked to leave. Also when we go our ice cream it was very watery and melted, had to go home and put it in the freezer.</review>

When we went in 20 minutes before close there was a large line, and within those 20 minutes more people arrived which there response was to tell them to leave because they were in line when they closed even tho they were in line before it closed... Some people waited in line 10 min before and were asked to leave. Also when we go our ice cream it was very watery and melted, had to go home and put it in the freezer.< /text>

I had an issue with an inner tube and it was fixed quickly and bought a new tire all for under $15. I also had a chain issue and he fixed it by tightening it up in about 4 minutes and fixed the handlebar as well, total cost $3. Fast service, great prices. Will definitely come in again.</text>

I was so amazed with this place.  I had checked out a few bike places prior to arriving here and my expectations were blown away! I just gave them a few of what I was looking for and they visually put together exactly what I wanted.</review>

Had many things replaced on it. He charged $80 for the job. He was timely, professional, and reliable. The bike has been in great condition since then. He stood open to complete my bike. I would recommend the place. He did not force me to fix anything, he gave me recommendations, but I never felt pressured.</Review>< rate>

It’s a good small store for parts if you need them but just feel like some of the bikes are a bit over priced like crazy almost 500 dollars for a bmx or mongoose lookalike when u can find a real bmx or mongoose for around 200 bucks on amazon not hating or nothing but the owner is a bit grimy man< /text>

Bad business ethics at this store.

Bought a bike swindled. Was told was reasonably new and all parts where good shape.

Come to find out it was rusty brakes about to fall off.

One night in and they would not return my money forcing me to keep the bike. Not that they did not over charge me.

FIRST TIME buyers beware of there poor business ethics and no moral attitude.

THEY are horrible a business !!< /Review>

<review>So many repairs and adjustments since July.  Awesome shop.  All the repairs and tuneups have held out longer than they have at most bike shops I been to in LA.  His tuneups outlast tuneups that cost double somewhere else.  Zero complaints.<//review><time>1513729066193</time></record></dataset><record>

It seems I can always find what I am looking for with Eddy Bauer. Their outlet store at Vintage Oaks Shopping Center is my goto place for clothing. Maybe because I like Eddie Bauer as a brand but also the quality is excellent and the selection at this store is always good. I am an average size guy and outlet/discount stores seem to lack the sizes of the average person. I think you know. Racks with small and extra large are always available, but try to find your size if you are in the normal range. Try Eddie Bauer. I am not an employee, just a good customer.<//review>

Eddie bauer-glad they are still in business.  Their quality still good.  Couldn't find anything I want.  Place is pretty neat.  Was greeted when I got inside   always cool (literally) when i stepped inside.<//Review>

<Review>Being an outdoorsman, I appreciate the presence of outdoor-*style* apparel stores in my area. The clothes tend to be a little thicker and more durable. It's a little expensive compared to normal clothes stores, but that's normal for an Eddie Bower. Luckily they have an extensive clearance section in this one. I wouldn't consider this a good spot for hard-core camping gear and equipment, but they've got some cool little gadgets and thick flannels, which is enough for simple family camping or day hikes.</Review><name>Ryan Donahue<//name><userid>107564928470656219510</userid>< Gmap_id>

<Text>I FOUND MY NEW FAVORITE LOCAL SHOE STORE!!!! I was skeptical about shoe shopping because it was the day before school starts, and I figured we'd get the last of the shoes...BUT...I was so happy with the service here! The owner was a total sweetheart! He helped my children like a true multitasker! My 6yr old got a balloon, and the owner pulled out a few jokes and asked my son to try on a HUUUGE shoe. It was so cute!
All my kids got what they wanted, and the whole staff was so helpful...giving us shoe, after shoe, after shoe...and being so patient. I was stunned with my service and I WILL BE DEFINITELY RETURNING TO BUY THE NEXT ROUND OF SHOES! AND EVERYONE SHOULD GO THERE TOO! They have kids, adults, tennis, watershoes, backpacks, and some clothes. (I'll take pictures next time)< /Text>< pictures>

I was in this area last week and stopped in here looking for some sandals. I like being able to support local brick and mortar businesses when I can. Yes, I found sandals that I love here. Nice people and good selection.<//text>

<Text>Great brewery! Good beer and a super friendly staff! The taproom has what looks like electronic darts and pinball machines. None of them were on, I assume because of covid but I'm sure it's great when they are on!</Text>< Pictures>

Went in for Karaoke and found out they'd stopped doing that, but had a singer come in. Hannah (I hope I'm remembering correctly) from Petaluma. Enjoyed her performance immensely,  not often a woman plays the Harmonica as well as Guitar. The brews were very good. Bought my first growler, which for me speaks volumes as to their quality. Looking forward to returning.</text>

If you happen to be at the San Francisco airport in the international terminal, stop by Napa Farms Market, sit down at the bar and enjoy. The food is delicious, the service is amazing, and say hi to Katrice. She will make you feel like you are home and like she’s known you forever. Love this place. Thank you Katrice.< /review>

<Review>Had a nine beer flight.  Most were lacking uniqueness in flavor.  The tastes and appearance were all very close, with just minor variances.  The red or pale,  being the only beer I would think about tasting again.  Only if I had to...   Even the IPA with a big hoppy name was not even close to living up to its namesake.

Nice location though.

Oh,  they charge to play the indoor shuffleboard game.  Seemed a little odd.

Pass on this place.< /Review><resp>None</resp>< time>

<Text>Maybe it's the day we visited. Maybe we just didn't like their beer.

The only bar snack they offered were bags of chips and the peanut butter pretzel from Costco.<//Text>< name>

< Review>
I always stop here on my way to Sonoma. It is a great location and a great atmosphere. The beer is good. They have a wide range of choices and styles that will appease any beer lover and causal drinker alike. If you are a beer enthusiast, or have a developed palate, you WILL pick up on the various nuances in their styles. It is nice, for instance they have a fairly constant, ever-changing rotation of brews on tap. They may have a couple, or three brown ales, for example. You can try them and pick out the subtle differences in them. Much like how wineries will have three different varietals cabernet sauvignon to taste.  Now, for some of the reviewers on here, this may be too much for them handle, which is fine, but then I would suggest getting a more "diverse selection" of styles, a selection where you can tell yourself "yes, now I know that is a stout, or yes, I know that is an IPA, I am sooooo good at beering!" You know, to make you feel better about yourself. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of their IPA's and pale ales. If you find that their IPA's do not fit the name they have chosen or are not bitter enough for you, all you simply have to do is ingest your outlook on life and reviews of breweries on Google to supplement your perceived "lack-of hoppiness/bitterness. Anyways, I have always had a great experience here. Friendly staff (not snobby at all), very casual atmosphere, and the beer is good. I always stop to get a growler fill and see what new beers they have on tap. If you are in the area, check it out and do not pass on this place. Don't listen to the naysayer. In fact, never listen to them. I always understand that their beer may not be a hit for everyone, no place ever is, just always be weary about a review that can't find one good selection out of the many that are offered. Check them out for yourself and form your own opinion. You won't be disappointed. Oh and the shuffleboard costs like 50 cents to play... so be sure to bring the family gold...< /Review>

Big fan of this office! It’s very clean and tidy. The staff is SO friendly and respectful. They really take their time to speak with you and answer any questions. Easy to park in their lot or on the street, too!<//Review>

Dr Sekimoto and his entire staff are the best! So kind, personable, gentle, and professional. I’ve always had a fear of going to the dentist, but they are incredibly  sensitive to that and always make me feel safe and well taken care of. They check-in throughout any procedure to make sure I’m comfortable and doing okay. Plus they do incredible work! My smile just sparkles when I leave there and I’m always so glad I went! There’s no other dentist in LA that I would go to!</Text>

As always Dr. Bedrossian took her time with me and worked on my teeth to make them beautiful, pain-free, and usable. You can trust her to do what is best for you and your health. Her staff is always Pleasant and smiling.</text>

I brought my family to Magnolia Park Dental 15 years ago and am so happy I did.  This family run business is truly about family.  They have cared for the dental needs my family.  They have worked with my once gap toothed kids on forming good brushing habits to now, caring for full grown adult smiles.  Clean office, great staff, and excellent dental care.<//text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>My first teeth cleaning visit:

My wife and I were referred to this dental clinic and now we highly recommend it.

Front office staff: a friendly and professional environment. Fast check in and out.

Hygienist: The best, Natalie does a precise and comfortable teeth cleaning. She is very knowledgeable and understanding.

Doctor: Dr. Sekimoto was very friendly and ready to provide dental advice.

Overall: excellent service and affordable prices!<//Review><user_id>108521955919798942351< /user_id><date>1604352119730<//date><Response>None</Response></record>

During this difficult time with covid, I felt really safe and everyone in the office was very cautious. My dentist apt itself went pretty good and I am very happy to join this dentist office and get my teeth taken care of here from now on. Very happy customer!< /review>

Always a pleasant experience. It took me a few years to find a dentist I could trust and who would never see my dental health as an opportunity to sell me something. But instead, genuinely care about my well being and my dental higiene without breaking my bank account. I am beyond happy that I was referred to this place.</Text>

From the front desk to the dentist chair, I felt welcomed, valued, and comfortable. Everyone was warm, and I was more at ease at this office. I went here for a second opinion, and so happy I did. Dr. efficiently confirmed some things, and I felt very taken care of. Genuine people in this dental office. Grateful< /Review>

As always Magnolia Park Dental does what they are great at, and they always find time to see me no matter the issue.
Dr.  Lena Bedrossian is fantastic at her patient Doctor interaction.
Thank you to the staff for always a warm greeting.
Erica who runs the front desk is the best!!

First time client. The receptionist (Erin?) who greeted me was prompt, pleasant and helpful. The office was easy to find, nice and clean with sufficient parking. Stephanie the dental assistant made me feel comfortable and took every precaution to ensure we’re both safe and protected before she took my X-ray. Dr. Sakamoto was friendly and professional and took his time to explain to  me what needs to be done. I was quite impressed and happy to recommend him and his practice if you’re looking for a new dentist. 👍👍<//Review>

<text>I can't say enough about how great they are! They have been treating our whole family for close to 17 years.
Office staff are extremely professional and very person enable.  While I have had both Dr Sekimoto  as well as his wife Lena  both are amazing. You couldn't go wrong with either one.
Very thorough while being gentle. Wouldn't think of going to any other dentists.</text>< Pics>

<text>Magnolia Park Dental Group is like ‘Godsend’ to our family.  We were on the lookout for a new dentist and found Dr. Sekimoto who practices alongside his wife Dr. Bedrossian.  They accommodated us on a rather short notice as our son was leaving for college at the time.  Everything went well during our first visit and we all felt that we finally found our family dentist!  Nonetheless, all visits so far have been pleasant and we always left the place very satisfied knowing that we were given the A-1 treatment.  All of the staff are very knowledgeable and courteous.  If you are looking for high quality dental work at reasonable cost with personal touch in a friendly and warm atmosphere, Magnolia Park Dental Group is definitely the right place for you!!</text><resp>None< /resp>< date>

<review>I've been a patient for nearly a decade--both dentists are outstanding, and the staff is fantastic.  They are considerate of your time (never waited for more than 5 minutes for an appt) and the cost is always very fair.  They are kind people who love what they do, so the experience is always a pleasure.</review>< Pics>

I have been a patient for over 15 years. The doctors and staff are just as friendly and professional as the first day I walked into their old office. Thoughtfulness and care are a priority. They always check with you throughout any procedure to make sure you are comfortable and appropriate action is always taken to minimize pain or discomfort.  In addition to the great doctors, the hygienists and front desk staff are always on point and accommodating. Many of my family members ranging in age from 7 to 50 are patients so I would feel comfortable recommending them to people of almost any age.< /review>

No waiting. Staff is super friendly. The doctors are not greedy and really care about the natural way of healing so if you don't really need to touch a tooth they won't. The staff doesn't get upset if you're a little bit late. They even let my 3 year old come in and watch my cleaning.</text>

This is a great dentistry.  Best I’ve been to. It’s always spotless. Front staff is nice and efficient. They are fast, organized and painless, always checking in to see if you’re ok.  I go to Dr Sekimoto, who is awesome, but one of the other doctors stepped in one time and she was great too.  I went for a cleaning today and their covid protocols made me feel safe the whole time.  5 stars no question.< /text>

I love this dental group! I had a cleaning today and the technician was very considerate and made me as comfortable as possible. She had good recommendations.

Dr Sekimoto is very knowledgeable and kind. Good planning for my future needs.

Their prices are very reasonable.<//text>

Have been a patient of Dr. Sekimoto for more than 10 years. He is an amazingly thorough and competent dentist. I had numerous crowns and other dental work done and it always comes out perfect!
He always gives me good advice and I trust his recommendations.
He is excellent!

I also like the bright , pleasant atmosphere of the office.

Last not least Dr Sekimoto has a lovely team working with him and his wife who is also a dentist.

I Highly recommend  Magnolia Park Dental Group< /Text>

<Review>Great experiences every time! Going to the dentist isn’t my favorite, but always feel like I’m in good hands at Magnolia Park dental. So far I’ve gotten all my old amalgam fillings replaced with newer, resin ones and also got my first crown. No issues so far and everything went as well as expected. Now I just have to get over my candy addiction.<//Review>< pics>

Years ago I was referred to Magnolia Park Dental by the insurance agent for the law firm at which I was then employed. He loudly praised Dr. Lena Bedrossian with an energy that was most uncommon for a dentistry-related discussion. So indeed I went to Dr. Bedrossian and Magnolia Park Dental and he was absolutely right. This is an excellent dental office. I have needed a wide spectrum of dental work since then and Dr. Bedrossian is an absolute perfectionist. I’m always so happy with the experience (which she prides herself on making painless) and the result. Her staff is impeccably nice and welcoming, as is Dr. Sekimoto who filled on for Dr. Bedrossian once. I was perfectly happy in that instance too. I recommend this dental practice and these professionals with utmost  enthusiasm.< /text>

I have been coming to see Dr. Bedrossian for years. The practice is perfect and functions seamlessly.  Clean, timely, professional and a polished delightful staff.
They are wonderful at their job and do terrific dental work and the energy in the office is so easy and relaxing compared to the lines and waits you find in other LA doctor offices.
She is the best. My favorite Doctor.  I can’t recommend their medical  practice or her service enough.</text>

Dr. Bedrossian is great! She has such a gentle approach and touch, that I barely felt anything. She’s extremely friendly and knowledgeable, both traits you often don’t find in a dentist. After other not-so-great experiences with other dentists, I’m so happy I found Dr. Bedrossian and Magnolia Park Dental Group!</Review>

Highly recommend. The staff is kind and friendly, the hygienists are all great, and the dentists are fantastic. I never feel like I'm being sold on anything more than I need, and in fact they are very cautious to do work unless it's necessary. Dr. Bedrossian has saved me from a root canal more than once. She's terrific.< /Review>

After years of avoiding the dentist because, well because no one likes going to the dentist, I fold this office.
I wish there were more stars available. Everyone here is lovely, super supportive, and really cares about you as a person, not just a patient.
Your dental health is their #1 priority, and your comfort is #2.
If you need a dentist, go here.<//text>

<review>Dr Bedrosian does excellent work. She is very thorough.  She has a pleasant chair-side manner  and Keeps me comfortable while I'm in the chair and constantly checks on how I'm doing and if I'm okay. Everyone at Magnolia Park is very friendly and helpful and make sure everything in my visit is complete from the minute I come into the front door to the time I leave.</review>< pics>

<time>1612487059962< /time><rate>5< /rate><review>An amazing group of people that provide the utmost in dental care. They take a gentle and effective patient-centric approach with each and every procedure, from a simple cleaning to implants. Throughout the years, I have referred friends who have had horrible past experiences with dentists, and they all regretted not finding out about Dr. Bedrossian and Dr. Sekimoto sooner. If you are in search of a great family dental provider, look no further. Superb and excellent service! I simply cannot recommend these folks enough!!!!!< /review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c295872304994b:0x6f2f52e54f98f50d<//gmap_id></record>

<review>Lena Bedrossian has been my dentist for 13 years. Each and every visit to her office results in masterfull dentistry, ultimate kindness and care. She is just simply one of the best people I know and those she has chosen to work for her are similarly delightful and skilled people. It may seem hard to believe, but I actually look forward to my dental appointments! Tim Dallinger<//review>< Name>

I have sent ALL my friends and family there, nobody is disappointed.  Natalie is the gentlest and most through dental tech I’ve ever experienced (so important).  The practice is clean and modern.  The scheduling staff sends reminders and doesn’t miss a beat.  I never sit in the waiting area for more than 5 mins.  And mostly, Dr Sekimoto is a stellar Dentist and a kind person, too.  My kids love this place as well.  Cannot give a stronger recommendation to this entire practice.<//text><UserId.>103393386693026061631<//UserId.></record>

I don’t normally leave reviews, but Magnolia Park Dental is the absolute best. Both Dr. Sekimoto and Dr. Bedrossian are completley kind, honest, and confident. I have been coming here for years, and have a great deal of dental work that has been done and more in my future. I trust them 100%.  Major dental work, for me, is scary and overwhelming, but I always leave feeling happy and knowing I’m in good hands. Also, the ladies who work in the office, both front and back, are very sweet and knowledgeable. I will never go anywhere else.</text>

<Name>carl bushnell<//Name><text>I love Manolia Dental Park.
Dr. Seikimoto is the best.
When I first went to him 15 years ago, I was on the verge of losing my teeth.  Gum pockets of 5 and 6.   He promised me he would save my teeth; he kept that promise and more.    My gum pickets are now mostly 2 or 3.

He is so nice and caring.  He remembers everything about his patients.   He always has a smile.  The office has very convenient hours too.

His wife has her practice there as well, and have seen her occassionally.  She is as wonderful as doctor Seikimoto.

I brag about my dentist, something I never did before.  Some of my friends and coworkers have switched to Magnolia Park and always thank me for the referral.

There is no place better or dentist better to care for your teeth.</text><rate>5< /rate><Response>None</Response><user>101485907250693296938</user>< pics>

<review>Dear Sir/ Madame at Barnes and Noble,

One month ago, just after my wife had passed away, one of your employees recommend  me the best book in my time of grief:  Come Away My Beloved, written by Frances J. Roberts.  I am very impressed that Rachel Tinker would choose this book out of all your books just for me at such a strategic time in my life.  Thanks to you as a company, and many thanks to Rachel Tinker.<//review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c328b1ab56c961:0xf8ab7f84acaaca9d< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

And the staff is OUTSTANDING, I've never had a bad experience there.</Text>< Pics>

<review>Love going to my local Barnes & Noble!!! Been going here for number of years and just love it. There's the Starbucks cafe there which makes it really useful to go read. You can also just go there to relax, bring and do homework, or even study. Overall, this place has given me many memories with family and friends in which I am grateful.</review></record></dataset><record>

<Text>I had a problem finding a book I was after, then I went to the customer service and the employee told me where to find it and then he took me where the book was

The female bathroom is very clean. When a person of my age that is important.

When ever I go to the Glendora store the employees are polite and very helpful.<//Text><rate>4< /rate>< name>

Good sized store. Nice amount of diversity (books, movies, music, toys, etc.). Store is in nice area, easy to get to. The store is always neat and clean. Takes a while to check out, never enough cashiers. Hard to find someone when you need to ask a questions. Seems under-staffed.<//review>

I went in for books on being a new big brother for my grandson. They had a whole little section and a salesperson led me right there. After choosing two, I was eligible for their children's book of the month at a discounted price...such a deal (10 dollars off). So, I left with 3 books in total. It is so wonderful to have a bookstore to wander through and shop. Hurray for Barnes & Noble<//review>

So my opinion my be biased because I am a bit of a book work, but I really like this location. The staff have always been super helpful and the place is always neat and tidy. My family and I visited to pick up some new books and take advantage of the sweet 50% off deals they had going on. At check out everything went smoothly, we paid for our stuff and just as we were about to leave the store associate that rang us up said, "wait, I'm sorry, but may I take a look at your receipt?" So, we handed it to him and just as he suspected one of the deals (buy 3 books get free tote) didn't ring up correctly and we had been charged for the tote. He made sure to check that all of the other deals went through and refunded the price of the tote. The entire time he had an amazing attitude and seem to genuinely care about the customers. He even kept thanking us for waiting while he corrected the systems mistake. We of course expressed how thankful we were because we probably wouldn't of noticed until we got home. This Barnes & Noble is a favorite in our book 😉</Text>

Unfortunately they didn't have the cross body sling bag I was hoping to find, though the man we asked for direction asked someone else about them before taking us directly to where they would be if they we're still on stock. Even helping us look through the bags they had. He did not offer to call the other stores for us, but we only had a limited time before catching our flight anyway. We left bagless, but happy.<//text>< pics>

Of the two locations I've been to, 1-was nicely maintained (Gladstone) & the other was a hot mess (cough, Tyler). Yet, the 2nd store had the most efficient customer care service, while the first mentioned had no one in sight (crickets). Normally, I don't judge establishments solely by their restroom (I totally do, #3 on my checklist) cleanliness, and I would suggest corporate invest ⏲️ & $$ to update them, considering the high use. These stores are good community spaces, and more interactive & dynamic outreach to promote reading to their local population would go a long way in increasing literacy and appreciation in reading for fun, relaxation, & escape from the din of busy-ness in work-life. Go and check them out, good sales can be had, especially for gifts.</review>< time>

<Text>Overpriced. So overpriced. I only went there because I had gift cards I needed to get rid of. I like the stuff I bought but if I'd had to pay my own money for it, I would have put it back on the shelf and left the store. WAY overpriced. Example- $7 for a pack of 5 gel crayons when the whole pack is so small it can fit in the palm of your hand. You can get a pack of 24 at Target for $3 less.<//Text><username>Trish Goodsell</username></record></dataset><record>

We were there with our two grandchildren to shop and attend the storytime. Unknown to us the first Saturday of the month is a service dog event.
It was very difficult to find room to enjoy the story due to the fact there were 10 to 12 large dogs situated up next to the stage listening area. The children had to take a back seat to the dogs.
Due to the lack of room and the inability to see or hear the story many of the families left, it was not a pleasant experience.
Suggestion: have the dogs at the other end of the children's section with the table and covered area. This will leave room to enjoy the children's storytime.
We also left without making the purchases we wanted too. Guess we will use Amazon too bad for the bottom line of one of the last existing bookstores.< /review>

found the books I was looking for.
great service and should have had a other register open. the young guy was very helpful in his  recommendations and the manager or assistant manager need to pay attention to the smaller details and have 2 registers open.
all employees I spoke with were very helpful.< /Review>

The store is always well stocked and maintained (minus the collectibles area but that is where the children roam.) There is an extensive ground floor open area that can be explored with ease, and help is always within earshot range. The help counter, which is located at the heart of the store, always has an associate that is willing to go the full 100 yards to assist you in finding what you are looking for, or to simply give you a recommendation. If you are looking for a friendly, yet clam and semi-quiet, place to purchase a book then this would be a good choice.

There is never really a large line in the check-out lanes, but if there is, you may have to wait a few minutes (they usually only ever have 1-2 cashiers working at one time) but the line is handled well.<//text>

This is my Favorite large book store. They have a Great selection and it's very Easy to find what you're looking for. There is a Starbucks but they don't take your Starbucks card.< /text>

Every so often they have some great sales that they set up in bins throughout the store. They apparently don't have them during the holiday season, I recommend going before tge holiday season if you're looking for great deals. Otherwise it's a great place to go for holiday gifts, just not a lot of good sales at that time.< /Text>

<Rate>5</Rate><Review>The store has a wide range of books. The only inconvenience is that some books are cheaper on the Barnes & Noble website than in store, and the only way you can get the online price is to buy online and pick it up in store. That's what I did, I was in the store but bought the books on my phone. It only took a few minutes for the books to be ready for pick up. Overall great experience, I got what I wanted for the lowest price they offered. 😁<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< resp>

Great book store, the staff are super friendly and really helpful. I love getting new books from this place, from time to time. It's a really laid back book store. You can also get your coffee fix off to the side at their own little Starbucks, and who doesn't like getting their coffee fix? Great place to find a new book, and just relax, overall great store.<//text>

This was a pleasant visit. Stocked up on a few goodies and made a stop at the attached Starbucks. Sam, the manager of Barnes is AMAZING!!! He took my order and was so helpful with suggesting what I should try and why (I was having trouble deciding).

Not a regular place for me to shop, but when I do its always good. They have a large journal selection and other gift ideas for that hard to buy for person in your life.<//text>

<review>This is probably my favorite Starbucks location for the main reason of their wide range of pastry options. They have an almond croissant that's exceptionally good. And being able to go browse the book store is an added perk.<//review>< user_id>

<Name>Martha Martin</Name><Review>Great location, clean, and neat. I rated three stars because the testing preparation section was more disorganized than your typical Walmart. Rather than a quick in and out purchase, I wasted my time looking for something that was supposed to be there, but wasn't. I ended up finding what I needed after painstakingly combing through the books one by one.<//Review><userid>105035625486147717657</userid>< Rating>

Has a Starbucks inside - but there is no place to charge a cell phone.
THEY REMOVED ALL THE AC OUTLETS.
If they had left them in place it would have had 5 stars.< /Text><user_name>Mike M</user_name>< user>

Big store location with plenty of space and great selection. Every time I thought I was done browsing, something else would catch my eye. The downside is that the line can be a little slow at times.<//text>

Variety is the spice that always lands places like bookstores to reinvent the product profile to appeal to diverse group of customers.  Books and coffee - a solid match.< /review>

Great location, clean, and neat. I rated three stars because the testing preparation section was more disorganized than your typical Walmart. Rather than a quick in and out purchase, I wasted my time looking for something that was supposed to be there, but wasn't. I ended up finding what I needed after painstakingly combing through the books one by one.< /review>

<review>I love going to bookstores and Barnes and Noble is the place I know I'll be able to find what I'm looking for. If I don't happen to find what I need, the employees order it for me online and I can pick up in store within a couple of days. The atmosphere is also nice and there is a Starbucks inside so I can grab a coffee and read my book.</review>< rate>

I love it here at Glendora Barnes&Noble , it’s so calm so peaceful and relaxing. I could be here for hours getting lost just looking around and checking out the children’s books 📚 for my child. It’s just soo relaxing being at Barnes . The staff is soo nice and soo very helpful . They have a Starbucks as well 💚 perfect 👌🏽 cafe and bookstore in one place love ❤️ it ! any book or anything you need and can’t find it on their shelves they’ll order it for you. They are very helpful to their costumers . Clean and neat store 😊<//Review>

I love this bookstore so much!  Their membership program includes discounts on not only the books, vinyl, CDs and toys/board games, but also on Starbucks products in the store!
This location has a very large discount book area for the frugal, and the staff was very patient in assisting me in looking for whatever I needed.  I never felt that they were bothered by my need for their time.

Overall, a wonderful retail experience for me and my son while we were there.  Definitely a favorite place to go while waiting for our movie to start in the local AMC theater.<//Text>

Sam at this location was just painful to deal with and sad to say it wasn’t just me who had the misfortune of dealing with him.  I personally watched Sam be short, angry and frustrated with the two people he dealt with and not helped before me and I knew right away that I was in bad hands dealing with him.  This location deserves zero stars, Barnes & Noble has really gone down hills these past few years.< /Text>

Always good service. Only one gripe...I know they need to put alarms on certain items  (Lego being one), but when they are so tight as to mess up the box, it makes that item unacceptable for a collector.  But when you're a member they are more than happy to order one for you and it's free shipping.<//Text>

<user>107025041939728076657< /user><Pictures>None<//Pictures><review>I visited this particular : Barnes And Noble store , on : Thursday , February 5th 2015 . The customer service is excellent. The shopping center surroundings are simply magnificent . AMC Theatre just a little north of this splendid and magnificent book store. Then the gym I so love: 24 Hour Fitness Gym. By eating properly and good work outs have lost ten pounds . My cholesterol levels have amazingly improved . So its wonderful after a good movie and an excellent work to venture to : Barnes And Noble , relax on very nice relaxing seat with soft music playing in the back ground .Then have my favorite latte or just a very nice coffee at : The Star Buck's in the book store. I was some what dismayed the Barnes And Nobel in West Covina is no longer there . Yet this one is so easy to get to its so easy to find. From: Azusa south ,right on Gladstone and left on : Shellman Ave. Its a very nice shopping center it does have nice posted signs to prevent trouble makers and some cameras . I love this additional safety. Especially if I go shopping and have leave a few items in my car. They hopefully will be apprehended . My experience was wonderful at this : Barnes And Nobel. I wanted to obtain a certain book the very nice and professional customer service is beyond words. Exemplary  , outstanding performance of the very beautiful blond and beautiful Latina ,to me beyond the call of duty. At both occasions as both were very busy actually stopped what they were in the process of doing to show concern with customer service love to order me a book not yet available in the store . This is how I love being treated . Along with the sir or Ms.  Supposedly some stores have closed because some customers choose to shop online. The significant problem with shopping online is the obvious: Identity theft. It is not solved and will always be a problem . I myself love to pay in cash. So if the excuse is to save money . Then ask any victim of identity theft how much did it cost to fix their credit rating ? Was it worth it gambling like this ? Plus all the pain and suffering just to save only a few dollars . When they could have enjoyed a very nice Latte or very nice : Starbuck's coffee . Relax after a great movie and a good relaxing work out , at :24 Hour Fitness. Then complete my journey with a very nice book to glance at , while relaxing to soft music in the back ground. This it self is such excellent therapy . Who ever invented : Barnes And Nobel should be put in for a award. As far as these two wonderful employees . Their display of kindness , patience love and under standing with exemplary customer service performance . They should properly be awarded. A  Certificate Of Excellence Award , in front of the store from the corporate office. On perhaps customer service recognition day. Just relaxing in a very nice customer friendly environment helps my chronic back arthritis temporarily go away. I do pray more stores do reopen. God Bless. I do hope if its not too much to ask : If the local Christian community can join me in harmonious prayer that more stores like this open . So much to offer . I felt the love, the care . It so helped me temporarily for a moment think of my recent pet that recently past on , in new light. In stead of being in mourning . Here I found a type of : Refuge . After a great movie a great work out. Some where to relax to soothing music with a coffee and a latte and glance at a nice relaxing book. With : Exemplary customer service. What else could we want . Not to exaggerate , but to some extent : It was like perhaps : Heaven on earth. Please keep up the excellent customer service: Barnes And Nobel. God Bless.<//review>< Gmap_id>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I love this place because I can take my son who is 6 years old and he can choose books for his age and they have many options. They have a discount card and it works very well. They have a place with discount books and I have found excellent copies. Additionally they have a Starbucks store inside and they give you discounts on drinks when you buy in the store.

<rate>1<//rate><Review>(Translated by Google) 👎👎👎 THEY DON'T DESERVE A STAR, THE STAFF IS NOT TRAINED FOR THE DIFFERENT AREAS TO BE COVERED. It was today 03 17 2018 at approximately 12:10 pm. And in the box I asked for reports for the replacement of my tablet nook, which I bought from my child last November along with an extra payment for the accident guarantee and they told me that it covers if the screen is broken or anything else. but the cashier called the person in charge of that area a mr. apparently Asian and said that I could not validate my warranty because it did not cover that damage, I repeated that when I bought the tablet they offered me that other guarantee that covered that and repeated that I did not look very upset. Then I left the place to see that the guy did not have the slightest idea of ​​what he was requesting, so I hope that in that branch he will be more careful when hiring the staff, that they really train them in the area they represent because it is very annoying to go and make them feel The clients like we do not know what we pay for the services. I better decided to go to the Chino Hills branch where I bought it and there immediately without further questions and with full knowledge of what I requested they attended me and gave the exact reports of the procedure for the replacement of my tablet.

👎👎👎NO MERECEN NI UNA ESTRELLA ,EL PERSONAL NO ESTA EMTRENADO PARA LAS DIFERENTES AREAS QUE DEBEN CUBRIR.Fui el dia de hoy 03 17 2018  aprox.a las 12:10 pm. Y en la caja pedi informes para el remplazo de mi tablet nook ,la cual compre a mi niño el pasado Noviembre junto con un pago extra para la garantia de accidentes y me dijeron que cubre si se llega a romper la pantalla o cualquier otra cosa.pero la cajera llamo a el encargado de esa area un sr. al parecer asiatico y dijo que no podia hacer valida mi garantia por que no cubria ese daño,le repeti que al comprar la tablet me ofrecieron esa otra garantia que cubria eso y repitio que no con cara muy molesto .entonces me fui del lugar al ver que el tipo no tenia ni la mas minima idea de lo que le estaba solicitando,entonces espero que en esa sucursal tenga mas cuidado al contratar al personal,que realmente los entrenen en el area que representan por que es muy molesto ir y hagan sentir a los clientes como que no sabemos nosotros los servicios de lo que pagamos .mejor decidi ir a la sucursal de Chino Hills donde la compre y ahi de inmediato sin mas preguntas y con pleno conocimiento de lo que solicite me atendieron y dieron los informes exactos del procedimiento para el remplazo de mi tablet.</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>
