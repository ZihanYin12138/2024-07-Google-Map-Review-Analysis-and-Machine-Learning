I love shrimp fresh rolls.  Fresh, crispy and sweet vegetables in it.  The chicken fried rice was so delicious, the other dishes were also very delicious.  Highly recommend this place.</Text>

<review>Was visiting from out of state, so it was my first time ordering food from Thai Time Bistro. Ordered the Avocado Curry, it was very delicious. Nice big chunks of fresh Avocado, lots of red and green peppers with plenty of chicken and several shrimp.
Patrick was the fella that took my order, he was very friendly with everyone that was placing an order or there for pickup orders.
If I lived near by, I would most definitely choose to order food from Thai Time Bistro often.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Don't fall for the delicious sounding description of thai fries.  They're just fries.  With warm ranch & warm ketchup. For $9. Also got the hot basil with shrimp,  it was mostly bell pepper & onion but the spice was nice.  I guess I ordered badly,  it wasn't very good.< /Review>

Ordered panang curry with a $5 upcharge for seafood. There were 2 fish balls and 1 tablespoon of crab. When I called to inquire the kitchen and wife of the owner, Patrick was adamant they added at least 5 different types of seafood implying Im lying. I definitely would not stay on hold with the restaurant for 15 minutes for $5. Terrible customer service and our family will never eat here again.<//review>

For ten years I’ve eaten here - but no more. When people said it changed and went downhill, I held out. But after today’s meal I can’t deny it anymore. Something’s gone awry, the quality has gone way down. I would recommend they either reevaluate how they cook food or that everyone goes somewhere else. It’s not the worst I’ve ever had, but no where near the best.<//review>

<Text>Unfortunately after changing managers I had to change a once excellent review. Thai Time Bistro in Ocean Beach does not have consistency among chefs. Before the old chef took over as manager you could order any dish without fish sauce. Now you can only get those dishes without fish sauce when she is there. So vegan options are very limited. They also don't tell you there is fish sauce in things when you order a vegetarian option. You must inquire each visit, and ask if you can get it without the fish sauce. The manager told me any of the chefs can prepare the dish without fish sauce. But I have been told repeatedly by other wait staff that getting items without fish sauce is not an option for the chef that is cooking. I have spoken to them multiple times telling them cohesion is really important. But they basically told me that they are not catering to vegetarians or vegans. So I figured a shout out was important. I won't be eating there anymore. Unfortunately there isn't another Thai place in walking distance :(<//Text><pics>None</pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

I visited San Diego and lived in ocean beach three years ago. I had deep impression about the boba smoothies these store provide. It was such a good memory. However, when I visited today, the food and service is terrible. I waited for about an hour to get my food and waiter and waitress just don’t care you at all. Alright, I will just keep the good memory and never eat here again!<//Text>

Food is great! But service is honestly the worst I have ever experienced. The girl is rude and every time I go she does not help or make any eye contact. We stood by the please wait to be seated sign for 15 min, and ended up seating ourselves. And was rude taking out order. The boy who eventually did everything else was much better. I hope he gets our very little tip that was left. This was the same situation every time we have gone there.< /Review>

The food was very good but all of the condiments on the table where in dirty containers. The spoons were crusted with dirt and the tops had dried crud on the inside of them. We let the server know, but she chose to do nothing about that. Will never be back with a place that's dirty. They only get two stars because the food was good but could have gotten a lot more stars had the Place been cleaner< /Review>

<Review>I'm really sad that it's not the same owners anymore. The food here used to be great! I'm visiting from LA and this used to be my spot for Thai food. Now, it's really mediocre and no one Thai seems to work in the kitchen. Don't get me wrong, the staff was really nice, but it's unfortunate that the food quality is not the same anymore. Every dish we ordered was missing key Thai ingredients, which made it taste bland and unauthentic. I think they should hire real Thai chefs to help the current chefs or change the restaurant to something their current chefs are best at making.<//Review>< Gmap_id>

I don't think this place is even open anymore and if it is why??? Have tried to go there several times and it was either closed or "cash only" the which they didn't tell me over the phone when I ordered. They had always taken card in the past. The soup I ordered didn't even fill the container. Just bad overall experience which is good bad because I used to love going in there back when they had their stuff together.< /Review>

<text>As like everyone else, this was the spot for me and ALL the out of state visitor's I would bring in regularly.
Everyone loved this place.
Now the food sucks, not hot, 50 min. wait time for food, 30 min. wait time for drinks.
I am so bummed,this place went downhill instantly.
The girl that waited on my party was rude, and had no want or desire to be dealing with customers.
She was so inconvenienced when we asked for bowls after ordering soup........
Silverware is also apparently something she huffs at when asked for as well.
I will no longer be spending money here.
Sad situation. Do yourself a favor and heed my warning. This place is very, very disappointing now.<//text>< Date>

<text>Used to be my Favorite Thai spot. They are under new management and the service is now horrrrrrrible. There is not even anyone Thai working here any longer. I would stay away from this place. They will charge you for food you didn't order. Menu prices are wrong and it's your fault. I used to go to this place twice sometimes three times a week and I gave the new management ample chances. I hope they get their act together so I can edit this review and put them back at 5 stars.<//text><gmap_id>0x80deaa36df5b5e0d:0x57b07837b19599dc<//gmap_id>< rate>

Food is excellent.  What they need to do is clean the windows inside and out. Looks as though they had them frosted they're so dirty.</review>

<user_name>Nate Miller< /user_name><text>Good happy hour, terrible terrible Pad Thai. I've tried the spot in North Park and hoped the OB location would be better but it's really not, unfortunately. The drunken noodles are better, but still mediocre (being kind). Their happy hour is worthwhile, especially if you like Soju or have wanted to try it. I'll come back for a drink but there's much better Thai food elsewhere in San Diego, really anywhere else.</text><Resp>None<//Resp><Rating>1< /Rating>< Pictures>

Not sure why the reviews are bad here, maybe from a previous owner. We were a bit skeptical to try a menu that has Vietnamese, Thai, and Chinese food but it was FANTASTIC! We are spoiled coming from an area with plentiful Thai and Asian food so we were not expecting anything great, but each dish exceeded our expectations! We had pad Thai, orange chicken, basil mussels, curry, and drinks. Really hit the spot, and service was excellent.< /review>

Was shocked when my bill came. I was charged $6 for 2 cans of coke and $1.50 for more white steamed rice. Food was to die for. But wont go back due to too many hidden costs. $10 of my bill was added but never discussed.< /Review>

<text>Terrible terrible terrible experience - I know it is tempting but don't do it! Staff has no clue what they are doing, the "bartender" was wearing heels (while behind the bar and in the kitchen - not safe!) and she treated the other staff terribly. Every table near ours had an issue with their order, it was a DISASTER.< /text>< name>

This place is good, we sometimes stop by for lunch. Our usual orders are the Panang curry , the pad thai, and the beef noodles. For lunch they have combos with an entree, a soup & salad, and an egg roll for $12 or up to $16 depending on the meat you order with it.

Update 4/20/18

Owners have changed, food took too long to bring out (some of our party got their food 45 min after us) and the recipes are different as well. Got my usual Pad Thai and there was just no flavor. Can't recommend anymore.<//text>

Nice ambiance for a strip mall, though you're in OB so it's better already. Their food and service are 4 stars caliber and their recent addition of a handful of good draft beers at a fabulous price earns an extra star!</text>

The good: I used GrubHub  to order, and my order arrived 15 minutes before expected. Food was a perfect temperature to dive right in.
The okay: The crab angel appetizers were just slightly overcooked,  a bit too brown at the edges. And with a subtle but odd salty taste.
The not so good: I noted on order that I wanted MILD, not spicy. My panang curry is definitely spicy, probably moderately spiced for some, but too spicy for me.  I also asked that the driver call when he arrived, so I was startled when there was a knock and no call.
I have eaten at all the Thai Time restaurants in San Diego,  always enjoy the food. But they went just a little off mark with this online order.< /review>

<Date>1492120804390< /Date><Rating>1<//Rating><review>First time at this location. Ordered the footlong tuna which usually comes with 4 scoops of tuna. This Subway put on 2 scoops and spread it out thin. When I mentioned wanting more tuna as I've had with other locations she rolled her eyes and said it would cost extra. This location is trying extra hard to lower costs at the expense of their customers and customer service. I also asked about sitting outside as their tables and chairs were tied together and inaccessible. The other shops in the center has their outside seating available. Walked out empty handed as I will never do business here and would not recommend anyone else!</review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPhP2X1ZPm0syBWxbHiiiasD9RjT-HIEWhtwn4T=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Response>None</Response><GmapID>0x808fcb92d418608f:0xea0beaff05810c29< /GmapID></record>

<rate>5< /rate><Text>This is my regular go-to subway. The staff is very courteous and is quick and accurate in building your perfect sandwich. There is usually a long line here during lunch hours due to the many businesses around. The wait time is not too bad even when it gets busy. They add 2-3 more staff if it gets extremely busy. Overall great service and more than what you would expect of a regular subway chain.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808fcb92d418608f:0xea0beaff05810c29</GmapID></record>

Staff is friendly. Service is attentive and quick. Their selection of some items tends to run out between 7pm and closing (10pm). I was there last week and it was what bread and today it was jack cheese. It happens when you carry fresh ingredients.</Text>

<Review>Sandwich is normal. The staff was very rude. 1st little girl doesn't smile or greet. Just, " what can I get you?"  OK whatever. I order. She passes me through the process of making a sandwich to the next person. Now this one. I request spinach. Extra spinach mind you. She gave me EXACTLY 4 leaves. She turned around and said something in Spanish to her friend then laughed. I asked for more spinach. She pretended not to hear me. I said nothing. I paid the next lady literally throws my $6 on the counter and walked away.  Lol. Notherwise a thanks or have a nice day. Nothing. Never going there again<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

DXL has the best sales associates. They can help pick out colors that go together and get you the right size. In these difficult times I have always been met with a smile and a willingness to help.<//text>

< Review>
The worker was extremely helpful and courteous. He arranged for my back ordered item to be refunded since I wasn't going to get it for weeks. And the item wasn't even rom his store but an online buy.
As quickly as I was able to tell him he was able to get it done. All while continuing to provide excellent service.</Review>

<review>3rd time I have been their since they rolled over from casual Male to DXL. 3rd time I have been disappointed.  They never have my size in stock anymore. They have eliminated many of the staple products I have been accustom to buying. I get change but when advertised as a Big & Tall and cant fit ya it's time to move on.<//review>< user_name>

After going to other stores in the area, we found DXL and so glad we did. He found something in his size, although they were quite pricey (over $70). But they fit, and they're better than the jeans he was wearing, so that's a good start.<//Review>< GmapID>

I always shop at DXL. Staff is very knowledgeable and go out of their way to make sure you're satisfied with your shopping experience. The only negative thing I have to say is the price is a little expensive, however you will find this to be true for most big and tall stores.<//text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Excellent Big and Tall store for men.  VERY PRICEY.  They say the extra matetial needed to make B and T clothing is the reason the cost is higher.  Now here is the twist, regular sized people will buy this type of clothing for the baggy oversized look.  So true B and T people end up with less of a selection.  Popular stuff gets bought out fast.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Good selection of big and tall sizes. Quality is good. But prices are high. You get what you pay for, I guess. They do send discount coupons every so often, and I used one today.</Text>

So It's a little pricey for the quality.  But there aren't many options for higher weight people. Staff was helpful but a bit hovering.
It was annoying that the person helping felt the need to share her husband had lost 145 lbs. Why would you tell your big folks clientele that? It's basically telling your shoppers that you think there is something wrong with their fat bodies. That is a poor marketing strategy.<//Review>

My shopping experience at the Fresno, CA Pier 1 store has always been good.  Friendly employees willing to help and answer any questions I have.  They have helped me find a design I liked or add to what I told them I already had.  Love this store.< /Text>

< Review>
They're running out of business and still have their products at a high exorbitant prices. Two cashiers and empty lines, because everything is way to expensive, I rather go to Ross for better service and better prices.< /Review>

<text>I come in to this store at least 3 times a month, & for it being small it does have a lot of beautiful furnishings, but now you go check out, & you will wait in line for at least 10 minutes or more & get this, with only 1or 2 clerks at the most working. And they will always say the one thing they know how to say, So sorry but we are short handed!  Well you can see the frustration of the customers in line. The truth is they will always be this way, they aren't going to hire any additional, & this is the one store you don't want to shop at during the holidays. It's really to bad! I stand in line for 5 minutes, then I go off to see if I missed anything, come back 4 minutes later, & the line & customers haven't moved. If you have a lot of time & don't mind standing & holding your items, this is the store for you. Happy shopping!!<//text>< Resp>

<text>Waited 4 weeks for two tables to come in & they didn't order the tables. Now they tell me they can no longer order these tables at all. Not pleased with your service. Probably will not shop at Pier 1 again. Plus,  I had to wait in line forever both times I went into your store to be checked out. Not enough checkers. Bad, Bad experience!!< /text></record>

I'm really disappointed with this place located off of Blackstone in Riverpark. That is the second time I have walked in there and the lady was rude. Furthermore they do not carry bed linen or anything for beds. They did have one comforter. I asked her if they carry do Carrie duvet look at me and away and replied no we do not. Could have said they had one comforter and bedding is located in such-and-such place. Rather just shun me but that is the second time I will not go back there again< /text>

< review>
I would not buy anything ever from pier 1. Walked in and spent about 30 mintues in the store not a single person who worked there came up to ask me if i needed help. I was looking at some items near the entrance and a couple came in, right away someone asked if they needed helped, i was litterly standing just a hop away from the employee.. I walked around where an employee was restocking items she never asked me how my day was or even asked me if i needed help finding anything. In my opinion, i wasnt white so i didnt get the same attention as some of the other white customers who came in go. Maybe i looked like i was so poor and couldnt afford such high priced items. But all in all i would not buy from this store or any other pier 1 stores.</review>

I cant say enough great things about Dr. Jones and his staff. First off, its very clear and obvious how much they GENUINELY care about my wellbeing and are all so very friendly and welcoming. Secondly, Dr. Jones is SOOO incredibly knowledgeable about the human body and how its suppose to function.. he figured out everything wrong with my back in seconds. And finally, ive seriously struggled with back pain my entire adult life and was at the point where i was considering quiting my labor intensive job over it, but now after going here and being treated by Dr. Jones and his team, my back has NEVER felt better. I could not be happier with my decision to come to Feel Good Chiropractic and HIGHLY recommend my friends and family and everyone else to go also :)< /Text>

I’ve been going to Dr Jones for years. I love how the office is relaxing and welcoming. He helped me get rid of numbing that was going down my arm. It only took about three visits. I keep going back because as my body gets older I have more aches and pain along my neck and spine. I always feel better after a visit to Dr. Jones.< /Text>

<name>Raymond Higareda<//name><date>1588359398876<//date><rating>5</rating><text>I suffered a back injury from squatting that left me incapacitated and unable to move without pain. The minute I walked in everyone treated me like family and was attentive to my needs and comfort throughout all the therapy provided. Dr Jones was able to pin point all the points where I felt pain without an X-ray simply using light taps and feels down my back. Immediately I could see the depth of knowledge and expertise he possessed. Not only was I able to feel immediate relief from my first adjustment, but I walked out feeling extremely confident in Dr Jones. I look forward to continuing my therapy and achieving my weightlifting goals with the help of Dr. J! Highly recommend everyone to give Dr. Jones a try, especially to all my fitness junkies out there!<//text>< Pics>

<Review>I went to see Dr. Heidi when I was 7 months pregnant. I was having pain in my left leg and lower back and wanted to see if she could help me. Dr. Heidi was great from Day 1. Her consultation was very informative and eye-opening. I had never been to a chiropractor before so it was really helpful to have her explain in detail how she could help me. I started seeing Dr. Heidi regularly throughout the rest of my pregnancy. I felt strong and was active until the day I delivered and I know it was because of her help. Following the birth of my daughter I saw Dr. Heidi regularly and she helped me throughout the healing process as well as helped relieve some neck and should pain from Breastfeeding. My daughter had her first adjustment at 3 weeks old and she helped us with things nursing and managing her congestion. We both enjoy our visits to Dr. Heidi, not only does she help us physically but she’s a great emotional support as well. I would highly recommend Dr. Heidi and especially to expecting or new moms.</Review>< Rate>

<Text>Dr. Jones and his staff are incredible. They know your name the minute you walk in the door and treat you quickly if you are short on time. Dr. Jones knows his stuff and will tell what is wrong and how you can fix it. My back is feeling 100% every since I went. I always look forward to going back and leave feeling brand new. Don't bother looking at any other places, just go to Feel Good Chiropractic.< /Text><Gmap_id>0x80945d64389bea7f:0x5716aaf9bef67d17<//Gmap_id>< userid>

I lift weights regularly and as an airline pilot, sit for long periods.   The chiropractors and massage therapist at Feel Good are the best and I don't know what I'd do without their exceptional care.  I've tried several different chiropractors in town and without a doubt,  Feel Good is the best!!</review>

Dr. Jones and his staff are amazing. They are extremely friendly and will make you feel comfortable. I've been seeing Dr. Jones for my neck and shoulder pain. He's done a great job and helped me alot. I also got the massage and it was awesome! I felt so much better after the massage. I love this place.< /text>

The girls at the front desk are super helpful and friendly, and Dr. Jones is friendly, personable, and funny - all while being professional.  The waiting room and massage area has dimmed lighting and relaxing "spa" music playing. Before my treatment with the doctor, I had 3 different massage treatments (two tables and a chair). Super relaxing! I felt as if I was at a spa!! Feel Good Chiropractic ROCKS!!!< /Text><Rate>5</Rate>< Name>

By far the best massage experience. The atmosphere is the most impressive. You get to relax before and after on cool massage beds/chairs. Rooms are private and peaceful.< /text>

The entire team at Feel Good Chiro is magnificent! They are all very kind, helpful and knowledgeable! The front office is always welcoming with a smile on their face and very accommodating with my work schedule. Dr. Jones is one of the best doctors I've meet. He not only treats and diagnoses, but also takes the time to educate his patients. This is rare for me to see especially when I am in the medical field myself. He goes above and beyond to ensure you receive the best possible care even if it means he has to stay later to take additional X-rays himself. Also an added plus is the massage therapists he has on staff! I found Dr. Jones while seeking a Chiro for my injuries from an accident, and I would definitely be a continuing patient even after my treatment is completed.</text>

<Text>My boyfriend and I currently live in Colorado and before our road trip back to California to visit family, he hurt his back. The 20 hour car ride worsen his condition and he, at one point, could not stand up for more than a minute before being in agonizing pain.
We saw another chiropractor about 4 times before we came in to see Dr. Jones and there were minor improvements following those appointments. Within the first visit with Dr. Jones, not only was the boyfriend's back significantly better but Dr. Jones educated us on some valuable tools and techniques for people with back injuries. He is also really down to earth, answers every question thoroughly and is a wealth of knowledge.
Boyfriend has seen Dr. Jones several times now and has had awesome results. He can now stand/walk for about 5 minutes before the less severe pain comes back. Utilizing the techniques Dr. Jones taught him has also made living with his condition much more bearable.
I have lived out of Fresno for more than 10 years but Dr. Jones may be the reason I move back!! He is seriously the best.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80945d64389bea7f:0x5716aaf9bef67d17< /Gmap_id><Pics>None< /Pics>< Name>

DON'T GO.  WORST CHIRO EVER.    Mr Jone is the worst chiro I have ever been to his staff make you wait and he only spends 1-2 minutes with each treatment.  All he cares about is getting money out of you.< /Review>

A MAZ ING!!!!! I spent 30mins to an hour calling all around Fresno and this is the only place able to get my insurance infomation confirmed and squeeze me in on short notice. Staff absolutely helpful, friendly, and welcoming. Staff made sure I was very comfortable with my first visit. The doctor told me I would be feeling a lot better within the next two days and that is exactly what happened. I go back tomorrow for a follow up and i can't wait. If I have any problems in the future I do not think I will be picking anywhere else to go. LOVE THIS PLACE!< /text>

#buyerbeware

I am super annoyed with Restoration Hardware. After spending $3000 on a “solid wood” table, the top vener gummed up with regular wear and tear. I am so sad I didn’t take a picture of that! It looked terrible, so we had to cover it with a table cloth. They would not replace it even though we notified them within 30 days of purchasing. They said it was not defective, but our fault for damaging the table. The problem was that the table continued to be damaged by just placing plates and utensils on it. They also recommended a repair kit, which we purchased, but was completely useless. So we decided to refinish it, Since we thought it was solid wood. We should have been able to stand down a layer or two and get to something that we could stain. Instead we spent hours of standing through multiple veneers to get through to the very last layer, which is pieces of plywood put together and not solid wood. I am super disappointed in Restoration Hardware because they are not an inexpensive brand and I thought they were higher quality, but clearly they are not. So frustrating.

RE: RH online customer service. I wanted to buy a couch in a stocked fabric so I could return it (and just forfeit the shipping cost) if I didn't like it. I found several couches and fabric choices that qualified. However, I chose "down-feather" instead of the "standard" fill choice, and didn't notice that the couch no longer qualified as stock and instead entered into the "you lose 50% + tax" of the cost of the couch if you return it category. It is my fault for breezing through the page that agreed with the return policy. I bought the couch, then realized what had happened. I called customer service the next day. The first customer service rep was pushy about there being nothing that could be done, stating, "are you sure you want to talk to a manager even though there is nothing they can do?", to which I said yes. The manager then said she could reach out to the manufacturer who declined the request to cancel the order, before they even started making it. We recently received the couch, and it is an eye-sore, which I will be returning. However hard you try to fluff and smooth the pillows, they look nothing like the photo of the Cloud Two-Seat Cushion Sofa. I am disappointed in my mistake, for one, and that RH could not help. Perhaps if they had a higher quality of customer service, I wouldn't have lost over $3,000 as a result.</review>

Never experienced such little respect from employees before. I stood there for 10 minutes waiting for someone to help me before I tracked someone down myself. At that point she proceeded to tell me someone will be with me in a minute and went to help another costumer that was already being helped by someone! Clearly, my money isn’t good enough.<//text>

I drove 40 minutes from my home to purchase a sofa along with pillows and two chairs. I walked through the doors and was greeted by...not a single soul. I found the sofa I was looking for yet sales associates walked by me over and over and over with out a word and avoiding eye contact with me. I walked around for almost half an hour and finally a women asked how I was. I replied I was doing well and before I could speak another word turned her back to stock fabrics. Not once was I asked if I needed help. To be fair I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt. maybe next time I go shopping I should dress for a job interview?  Off to HD butter cup where they under stand good service let alone ANY type of service is what sells.< /Review>

<review>Do not purchase off the floor!
Went to the Corte Madera store and found a very nice bedroom set off the floor for a great deal. I was told it might take "a couple of weeks for delivery but certainly not months." Five weeks later and having heard nothing I found out that the sales folks do not take any accountability for when the furniture is delivered and in fact they state that they cannot even estimate. A total run-around. Meanwhile they have my money and after several calls I am still without the furniture and have no idea as to when it will be delivered.  Worse than the CA DMV. The two stars is generous but it is for the value IF I ever get the furniture.< /review></record>

If I was ever going to buy anything from them, they just made sure I would not. In today's age where everything is available online and consumers shop, share and find information with a click of a button, why commit such an environmental faux-pas? I cannot imagine how many trees were felled to send these unwanted gigantic catalogs.</review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>First, let me say that I have never left a review before, but felt absolutely compelled after seeing some people that had a negative experience. I hope that someone sees this when they are trying to find a place when they are in as tough of a spot as I was.

Dr. Madearis is an absolute gem. She is kind, thorough and really explained things in a manner that was easy for me to understand. It's nice to feel like you are included in the process of treating your pet. The communication from the clinic as a whole was very good, even in the pandemic, when they have a bunch of excuses for not being communicative.

It wasn't cheap. But it was worth it to get my cat back and good health. They did that and made me feel like Topper was in great hands the whole time. So much so, that she will be going there in the future regardless of the price. Thanks, from both of us!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>When my adorable Pembroke Welsh Corgi needed emergency help yesterday and that same corgi's mom was up in LA, my caring neighbor took her immediately to VCA in Indio.  Emmy was taken right in to see Dr.  Boone, and, the Dr. successfully took care of Emmy's problem.  My neighbor raved and raved about the kindness of the staff and the efficiency of the office.  Needless to say, my drive back from the City of Angeles was a worrisome one, but, when my dog greeted me at the front door looking A+, my worries were elated.  Hats off to this VCA for caring so much for the "love(s) of my life"!!!!!!!</Review>< Rate>

<rate>2<//rate><Text>I will say the care they provided was very good. Their professionalism and quality is great. I took my cat here as a last resort emergency visit as they were the only available vet on a Saturday. However, the initial treatment they recommended was 7400 dollars which I could not afford and the treatment they ended up giving my cat was still 1000 and temporary. I ended up having to take my cat to another vet a week later for the same issue. The second vet offered the same initial treatment as VCA Indio but for 1000 instead of the 7400 dollar cost. If you have the money to spend then I’m sure they’ll give you fine treatment. If you’re like me and have a tight budget (and have the option of going elsewhere) I highly suggest going somewhere else.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

<user>101630976117505693337< /user><Text>First of all, they misspelled my pet's name even though we spelled it out and it is written on her neck. Second, their price for keeping her for 2 days was $4,500. Google said the highest price for 5 days was $3000 and it was way above that for just 2. When asked if there was any wiggle room in the price, their exact words were "No, your other option is to take your pet home and let her deteriorate." For just $700 they sent us home with all of the medications that she would receive at the hospital so why would the price be so different and why would her being home make her deteriorate if it's the same treatment. A lot of the other reviews said that this place is just money hungry. When we asked questions about dosage, instead of just answering the question. We were laughed at, and told "the paper says" when it didn't say. This was a very bad experience, I suggest going to ANY place other than here. I also watched them be just as mean to all of the other people waiting in the parking lot. People go through a lot of stress when their pet isn't feeling good, they could at least have some compassion.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

First, I want to say not everyone at VCA was awful. There was one girl I spoke who who genuinely was very kind. That being said, I have had two really horrible experiences here. VCA vets seem to do the bare minimum, won't do everything within their power to help (even if there are options), and the prices are astronomical. Because this places has the vet techs do all the communicating important information got lost, misconstrued, or were misunderstood *BOTH* times. For example, I was told I was given an inhaler for my pet, but was actually given tablets. That's fine, in fact, I preferred that... but it wasn't communicated to me so I was very confused when I went to the pharmacy and thought I had the wrong stuff.

When I asked if my pet was calm and stable,  somebody at VCA told me, "Well, the vet recommended more diagnostic tests for a reason." ....I'm not sure this person even realized how wildly unhelpful that is as a reply. I understood the vet recommended nearly $2000 of tests, but that did not answer my question.

For a bit, I thought maybe this was what great vet care looks like. I blamed myself for just being anxious. Then, I was able to get her to Animal Samaritans this morning for the same urgent diagnostic tests recommended by VCA. The vet at Animal Samaritans took all the time I needed to answer my questions. In fact, that vet started right off the bat by letting me know my pet was a little upset about being there so they took some steps to help calm her. The vet also told me they would do a few things for her "just in case" because they know how expensive tests can be and wouldn't push any of them if we could help avoiding them.</Text>

< Review>
So here’s a story, my husky got out this morning but came back to our front door and was having breathing problems and was lethargic and wasn’t eating or drinking for my wife, she called this location and was told to just bring the dog because it’s an emergency and they’ll figure out if she digested something that she shouldn’t have when she was out of the house, when I get off of work and go to bring her to this location we call and tell them we had talked to someone before and were told to just call before we got there (the whole ride there our dog didn’t move at all didn’t look out the window she just laid on the floor clearly not being herself and still not really eating), so anyways during the call they told us we might just be turned away if she’s not bad enough, we had assumed she ate something or got into something that was toxic or harmful to dogs and wanted to make sure our little husky was ok (we found our husky on the street after trying to return her to her owner and they just let her get out again and didn’t contact us when we said we had there dog, she’s very skinny cause for concern, and always scarfs down all the food we give her) we get there and wait a hour after they agree to see the dog just for someone to come look at her and have one of us walk her to their door at which time we’re told it will be at least 3 hours, me and my wife go get food and relax and when we’re don’t eating my wife calls, they said her exam was already don’t and the doctor was taking his time to call (poor work ethics), they then tell us nothing is wrong with our dog she’s fine and has no problems other than being skinny and we already knew that was a problem and wasn’t the reason we brought her in she is still the same and before we took her in so it wasn’t helpful at all, the doctor telling me she’s fine just skinny cost $80 for some reason and then they told me they could do other work for hundreds to thousands of dollars being stated multiple times (and kept telling me 80$ so far so clearly only caring about money) then we go and pay for her which was had enough when someone can’t copy numbers down (cough cough, front desk) and after that they said our husky would be out shortly, which took 45 minutes just to have someone give me a receipt and my dog back, making sure I saw the receipt and making sure I know much I paid. My dog looks more frightened walking next to that person than she did when we found her on the streets. I’m very disappointed and overpaid just to have someone tell me my dog has nothing to worry about but at the same time she doesn’t want to move eat or drink and still looks terrified.< /Review>

<Rating>1</Rating><Review>So I've been here twice recently. Once in November of 2020 and now February 2021. Both times for an ear infection that cost me at least a good $430 each visit.

I hate to agree with all other horrible reviews, because they have helped me with Gigi. Its has came at a very costly price. It's TRUE, that they will only help if your willing to pay for what ever estimate they give you.  It is sad that they charge so much $ for exams that may not be helpful or required. They didn't not explain the medications to me until I asked the guy that handed her to me. I think he didn't speak English well because I could not understand him but I didn't want to be rude. I just figured I can look up on how to give her, her medications. ALTHOUGH I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO DO THAT, SINCE THE VET SAID SOMEONE WOULD EXPLAIN THAT TO ME......

We come here because in an emergency it's the closest animal hospital that we know of. We've had a horrible experience with them back in 2013.

11-24-13 - Chico passed away
At my house, it felt like so many agonizing hours had gone by but it had been less then 24hrs since I had brought him home to die because i couldn't pay the 2 quotes that were given to me. 1 around $3,600 and 2nd quote over $6,000. Never did they offer me euthanasia and it didn't cross my mind. In my head I was trying to come up with at least the first quote. Watching a loved pet die when we have the option of euthanizing them, is outrageous.
I spent my holiday's crying in disbelief. Wondering why didn't I asked them to euthanize him. I was depressed for about a year and it took a lot for me to get over the way thing's went down. I still have both quotes saved in a box with my Chico's belongings...

No I would rather not contact or email your hospital manager Annette Lara.<//Review>< Pics>

DON’T go here. The Veternarian with the short hair with an ACCENT was HORRIBLE! Get rid of her. She has horrible mannerisms, horrible attitude & does not have any compassion for pets, just money hungry. The whole business is poorly mannered and out for money. Took my cat there in an emergency thinking he would need to be put down and with all the stress already contributed, that “Vet” treated my mother poorly. I will be reporting her to where she obtained  her license. Horrible horrible , should be very ashamed. My mother asked to see our cat before they euthanized him and she RUDELY ABRUPTED with a “FINE” with her arms up. So unprofessional. Stay way from this veterinary place and go somewhere they will actually care about your kitties and dogs.</Text>

< review>
My 6 month old, 4 pound Pomeranian was deathly ill. She was bleeding from her rectum and vomiting blood. We took her to this Emergency hospital about 6PM. After waiting for quite awhile, a technician finally came out and asked us a bunch of questions. He was wearing a mask and never came near my puppy that I was holding in my arms wrapped in a blanket. I was also wearing a mask. The technician turned us away saying they were too busy to take my puppy. Horrible, horrible experience. I had to wait until the next morning to take my puppy to my regular vet. I have added a photo of the blood from my puppy which I had shown to the technician.</review>

<review>It has been 2 and 1/2  months since my pet's visit at this hospital. I have gone back and forth about writing this review but I believe I need to share. On Valentine's day this year, my daughter dropped a pork rib bone and my pug ate it. It was around 5 pm that this happened, so I rushed him  to this hospital that is an hour away from me because when I called them and they asked what my emergency was they said he needed to come in right away. I got there and the check in process was fine, they came out and got him, gave him Subcutaneous fluid and anti-nausea medication so he would not throw up the bone. They also took x-rays. Then the doctor called me and said he could do surgery to remove it by either doing it endoscopically or cutting him open. They quoted me $9,000-$11,000 to do this. When I asked the doctor if my dog's stomach acid would break this down and he would be fine, he said to me "No, that won't happen" which sounded to me like surgery was the only option. I had already paid $1,100 for the x-rays, emergency visit, the fluid, and the medication.  I was devastated and unsure what to do, so I went with my gut and took him to my regular vet the very next day. My regular vet looked at the x-rays, and said that YES HIS BODY WOULD BREAK THE BONE DOWN. She did admit that she had never seen a dog swallow a pork bone so she didn't know how long it would take for him to break the bone down. She said to keep an eye on him for symptoms of pain, not wanting to eat, lethargy, etc. and that if any of that started to occur to bring him in. It has been 2 and 1/2 months now and I am happy to report my dog has broken down almost all of the bone, save for one little piece that is now left. My dog has been going back in once a month for x-rays to keep an eye on him. I normally am not one to say anything but I think it's wrong to quote people thousands of dollars for something that he may not have even needed. If you are a vet and don't know the answer to something, you should be honest with people, like my vet was when she admitted she had never dealt with that before. Had I not gone with my gut, I would have forked over all of that money and for what? Doctor Dalo is the one that helped my pet this night.</review>< pics>

We had to have our beloved pup Abbey put down on New Year’s Day. Everyone at this hospital were compassionate and professional. The doctor  was so kind and she explained everything to us. The supporting staff members were wonderful. They all made a very painful experience a little easier to bare. I just want to thank all of your who were there in our time of need. I thank God for you because we don’t even have a vet her in El Centro Ca right now. So once again, thank you and May God bless each and every one of you.< /Review>

After a really rough night I called VCA balling my eyes out at 7:30 am and they took Molly in right away. I told them we needed to put her out of suffering immediately and they let us go ahead. I realize people may have been mad, but Molly was suffering hideously and VCA and their staff were so thoughtful. It was a terrible time and nothing was going to give me comfort but I was surprised that after I said goodbye they wrapped her nicely in her favorite zebra print well and placed her in a nice little card board casket with fresh flowers taped on the top.

This clinic wanted to send us 2 1/2 hrs away cuz they are full if your pet is not dieing they send  you to Temecula area at 9pm at night I don’t recommend this place I strongly recommend anywhere else but here . If your babies (pets) need help try some place elsewhere. Cant trust a clinic that turns people away.</review>

<review>I had a dog with severe diarrhea. I called at 7am to see if I should come in. I was told to come to the clinic and call from the parking lot. I called in from the parking lot to be told there was only one Doctor there. I would need to wait and they would get back to me. After waiting in the parking lot for 30 minutes, I received another call to be informed they can not see me and to call and find another Vet. Terrible service, especially when dealing with an ill dog and a concerned owner. Would NEVER recommend them.</review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

<rating>5<//rating><Review>I can't thank the team at VCA enough for taking care of our girl. Our 5 month old pup Neesha became extremely ill while we were on a weekend away in Palm Springs and VCA were the only ones who were able to take her in. We came to find out she had parvo, even though she was fully vaccinated. Yes, it was a costly experience that had to be paid upfront, but the vet staff called us twice daily with updates and talked through Neesha's needs and improvements. She stayed 4 nights at VCA and it back to her usual self now. We are so thankful for the staff VCA for their incredible work nursing our girl back to health.< /Review>< Pics>

Do not take your pets to this place. They are over priced and do not care about you or your pets. I recently had to take my dog Buffalo here he was in pretty bad shape, I wasn't sure what was wrong. Something he ate I thought. They asked for 500$ to attempt to stabilize him. I said fine. Then they said they needed 2700$ to keep him overnight and see what happens. I said I don't have 2700$. They said we should put him down cause he's really suffering. I said no, they charged me 250$  total. 125$ for an emergency office visit, and 125$ for an IV and meds.i took him to his regular vet and they charged me 60$ for the ER visit, and 40$ to redo the IV VCA put in. They charged me 400$ x-rayed him, checked his blood, and liver. Kept him overnight and now he is doing fine. This place is a rip off, they should be shut down taking advantage of people with their pets. I want my 250$ back. Do not take your pets to this place. Banning veterinary hospital is the best and doesn't rip people off. I want my 250$ back VCA.< /text>

Had the worst experience in this place!!! They care more about the money than actually helping the animals when they are in pain. Brought my dog since he was in pain, 2 hours after I had to call to ask for status and instead of giving me status of how my dog  health they give me all the expenses I have to pay before they can a diagnostic. Then I found out that no pain medication was given to him all this time...2 hours after... so he was there just like me waiting while he was in pain, they charged my credit card and still no pain medication!!!! Worst place to take care of our animals!!!< /Text>

I was forced to come here for my dog's ear infection because his vet was booked for the month due to covid.  I arrived at 4:15 pm on a Monday after work and called the number that was posted (covid restrictions) from my car.  After 9 missed calls, they finally picked up. The assistant that came to get my dog said it would take "about 2 hours," but someone would reach out to me for a treatment plan shortly, so I should "stick around."

- 6:00 pm: I am called to discuss the treatment plan. I go home.
- 6:30 pm: The vet calls me to discuss her preliminary report. I'm put back on hold to the assistant who tells me dog will be ready in about 30 minutes.
- 7:00 pm: I arrive back at the hospital and my dog still isn't ready.  I call, get put on hold, then told another 15 minutes.
- 7:30 pm: I call again, put on hold. I'm now told he's coming out and to wait in my car.
- 7:45 pm: Still no dog, call again, put on hold, they tell me he's coming out.
- 8:00 pm: The vet calls me to give me the final report of my dog's visit. (I thought my dog was coming out 30 minutes ago ????)
At this point, I tell the vet to bring my dog out immediately.
- 8:15 pm : still no dog. My wife stops a worker that comes out to request our dog. He tells her he will bring him out.
-8:30 pm: We finally get our dog, an hour and a half later than expected. No courtesy call, a bunch of false information.

All in all, waiting almost 4 hours in the summer heat in my car after a long day at work, I've had enough.

Also, the final report that was given to was very suggestive of a "copy and paste" report.  someone else's dog's name was accidentally left in the report (my male dog isn't named Lola).

In conclusion: A 4 hour wait in the heat due to lack of proper communication from the staff; all empty promises.  $300 (which was overcharged $70 and in the process of being refunded) for an Ear Cytology (or fancy term for a Gram stain) and a topical cream...and a patient misidentification in the official take-home report.

Pro tip: if you are in need of last minute dog sitting, bring your dog here for a non-emergent visit.  They'll keep your little buddy.

Staff was friendly enough, at least as they were lying to me.

Never again.< /Text>

<Review>They are very professional and have great communication. I took my puppy due to her eye being scratched, they do not let visitors in (due to COVID precautions) but they called and kept me updated every step of the way. They also asked for permission to proceed with any new procedure or medication they needed to do/give. They sent me home with all the medication I needed and my baby is now 100% better. I also had seen an emergency (maybe life threatening 😪) come in while I was waiting and they did not waste their time. They ran out to her car to get her pet and then came back out to update her and let her in to the office. Like I said I am not sure of the circumstances but they were very fast and I appreciate that they put in that extra effort. I highly recommend this office. Ps. They charge extra after certain hours. I believe it is 6pm.</Review>< Rating>

This is the most incompetent organization I have ever dealt with. Save yourself the headache of taking any of your pets here. From being nearly impossible to connect with, charging different prices for the same services, then after paying in full, sending a false amount to collections. Being placed on hold then hung up "accidentally" on numerous occasions when calling them. Error with my puppy's surgery which turned 1 surgery into THREE. Having urgency to get payment for an invoice and requiring me to PULL over on the side of the freeway to give my card info on the way home versus just asking for that information while I was there!  However when picking up my puppy at the time they selected, made me wait 2 hours in the parking lot before giving her to me. Unprofessionalism galore. No one there speaks to one another, all seem to need training. Entire experience was beyond horrible and after they figure out how to tell collections I don't actually owe them anything, I hope to be done with them and will NEVER return!!!!!<//text>

Originally, I had looked into hiring a mobile vet, but they weren't willing to travel to our area during the pandemic. Our guy had a rapid decline one morning, and our regular vet was not available for Euthanasia in their office for 3 days. I didn't want our guy to suffer that long, so I contacted VCA. They were incredibly kind, and were able to take him in right away. They gave us time to say goodbye privately, and they helped Dex to pass peacefully. We paid for private cremation, and his ashes were returned to us in a beautiful wooden box along with a keepsake ornament of his pawprint. I cannot express how much our family appreciated the professionalism and empathy expressed by all of the VCA staff who took care of us in our time of need.< /Review>< Pictures>

On Halloween, our Boston Terrier, Baby Girl, experienced a medical emergency and our regular vet was unable to see her on an emergency basis. We brought her to VCA based on the recommendation of vet tech, Alicia, who used to work at our usual vet office. Dr. Gilabert treated her and not only was she thorough, she was able to determine exactly what was going on. She (including her entire team) treated her like one of her own and was was the most thorough vet we have ever been to! We had such an amazing experience that we have decided to switch from our usual vet to Dr. Gilabrand. We feel more than  confident leaving our fur babies in her care and know that she will do everything she can to provide the best care possible. Thank you for helping our sweet girl and making her better when we thought for sure we were going to lose her.< /review>

This is just the short version. I took my precious Savannah to this place because she could not breathe well. I thought it was great that I could get her in right away. Well, I sat in the parking lot waiting for a tech to come get her and speak with me about her symptoms. It took 2 hours before anyone came out. (waiting in car due to covid restrictions). I waited another 2 hours in my car for the vet to call me. When he did finally call, he said he had no idea what could be wrong with her and he would need to do x-rays, blood work etc. So I waited for all of that to be done. 2 more hours later the vet calls me. "Oh good news, she has no cancer". Ok, wonderful news I thought. Didn't know he was looking for cancer! Then proceeded to tell me he would have to send out her blood work and he would call in a few days. Does not make sense. Well, I took my Savannah to another VCA vet in La Quinta the following week. In 10 minutes the doctor told me she probably has cancer. They tested her and she did have cancer. Before that week was up I had to send my precious girl to doggy heaven, she had gotten so bad.   2 weeks after her visit to Indio VCA, the doctor calls with results of her blood work and what we can do for her next. He works at an emergency vet hospital and it took 2 weeks to get a call back. Unbelievable!!!! And yes, I made numerous calls. Also very hard to get a hold of anyone. I wasted 6 hours and over $1000.00 for absolutley nothing. Charges are crazy no matter what time you get your pet there.< /text>

I understand that we all need to be extra patient during this pandemic, and I appreciate businesses that put safety first. That being said, this was a nightmare.

The process to check in is not followed at all. You are instructed to call, but if you can get through, you sit on hold. Phone was busy for several tries, and when I got through I sat on hold for an hour while I watched others come and go by rudely flagging down techs or going inside (against COVID guidelines). I understand that treatment will be prioritized by urgency, and my dog has an ear infection, not urgent. I was being patient, but finally had to flag down a tech to let someone know I was there, I realized that I would be there forever if I didn't.

They took my dog when I was there for two hours. I can see and hear people bringing in their pets, and watched over a dozen non-emergencies be treated and finished while I sat.

At 5.5 hours I lost my patience. I can't get through on the phone to get any updates, and the poor techs are running around the parking lot, overwhelmed, and I can't flag one down. Now dozens of people have come and gone while I waited. The louder and more rude you are, the more likely you will be noticed.

I finally went inside and said that I wanted my dog back. I had already paid for her treatment and said I wanted a refund and that I would bring her elsewhere. They promised me just 15 more minutes, I agreed. 30 minutes later I was about ready to call the police if they would not give me my dog. They told me the treatment was done. I don't know if they rushed the treatment in those last few minutes or if it had been done awhile.

My complaint is NOT about the wait time. My complaint is about the lack of any process to prioritize care or communicate with customers. The only way to get treatment for your pet is to rudely interrupt someone else's treatment by screaming to get a tech's attention, or to barge inside, against COVID precautions. The poor techs. It was complete chaos.

As if this was not traumatizing enough for my dog, it seems they did not even give her water while they had her who knows where for hours. She drank two bowls of water at my car, and another big bowl of water as soon as we got home.<//Text>

They charged us $250 to check him in the facility. They made us wait 6 hours with no update how our dog was doing or inform us about his condition. We had to call them back to check in. Finally someone came out after 6 hours of waiting to advised us to do a physical exam. Which we thought they already did. Then it costed us more money roughly about $500 do the physical exam. After we paid. They call us back 2 hours later saying he is not getting any better and its best to do surgery. We discussed about the outcome and our family decided to just take him home so he can pass away in the comfort in our house. The vet assistant told us they wouldn't give him to us. They insisted keeping him. I am currently a vet tech student and its against the law for animal hospitals to keep the animal from the family if they decide to deny care for them at the facility. So they kept insisting keeping him and offered us to put him down. Which costed us more money. Another $750 so they can sedate and put him to sleep.  After waiting a whole  8 hours of the situation, the decision was made to put him to sleep. ( which we could have done somewhere else that was cheaper). It was until 5:30pm we said our last goodbyes to our dog. Anyways, this place only wants you for the money. They do not care about the animals here. We wanted to take him somewhere else but they insisted keeping him (which is illegal if the owner wants the animal back). We also came to bring a stray cat today  because he has a patch of skin off from his left side off. You can see the cats flesh muscles. It looks really bad. We called to check the cat in and they said they will be out to check him. We waited for 45mins and seen the vet assistants avoiding our car (that was there first before any other cars arrived) and they never came to see the cats condition. Which I thought was very wrong because vet hospitals should care for the animals as their slogan says. So we left and came to a different animal hospital on Washington St. Upon arrival, They gladly gave us the paperwork right away and check the cat in ( which we only paid $60 than paying $250 on Jefferson Animal hospital.) Overall, I hope you guys fix your system. Its uncalled for to charge ridiculous amount of money to help and care for animals. Definitely not returning or bringing any animals to this "emergency animal hospital".<//text><gmap_id>0x80daf85228e4e75f:0xf3c0302ed6b3c63c< /gmap_id><Pics>None</Pics></record>

I do not like to write negative reviews, yet this place deserves it. I had the unfortunate experience of having to come here daily then every other day for a long time, I spoke with most their staff and I agree with other reviewers. There are plenty of reasons to be completely outraged and upset with the staff there. I've spent a ridiculous amount of money here which is all they care about anyway.

- Expect to wait long hours. I would take my dog for bandage changes 8-9 hours became normal, poor guy in a metal kennel all day for a 15 minute procedure.

- One doctor asked me what antibiotics my dog was on and I quote him "So I don't have to read his paperwork." Then went on to say we need to do cultures which we already did do. Hope you don't get that doctor.

- Doctor Boyd is completely awful. She kept my dog there all day and then refused to change his bandages and put a catheter in for his uti, his bladder was completely full when I picked him up. All she wanted to do is euthanize when I refused she told me I can't come back to this hospital any longer. She doesn't believe dogs in wheelchairs have quality of life. Apparently no one else is capable of putting a simple catheter in a dog but them and she told me to bring my dog in 2-4 times a day with a $97 charge each time.
We're pretty sure this is the same doctor who over a year ago told us our little dog has cancer and he won't make it through the night, let alone to san diego vca the next day. Complete misdiagnosis and shame on her for putting us in such a state of fear. He's still alive today. NO signs of cancer and in perfect health. Good thing we didn't listen to her ridiculous urging of euthanasia. Can't help but wonder how many poor others received false information.

- They told me my dogs wounds would never heal, well they did. They said he would never pee on his own, well he did.

- Their manager will NEVER call you back - they simply don't care. As other reviewers have said. If one of their doctors treats you badly you'll have no one to speak to about it.

- God forbid you have an issue with insurance, they will NOT help you. Evelyn who manages insurance told their staff she called me and talked about it, when she never bothered. You will not receive their help for claims.

- Juan and Dr Gilabert are good people. In my experience there, he was one of the two only techs willing to talk to people and answer their questions.
Others rarely ever said hello let alone welcomed your questions.

They're busy because they're the only emergency hospital here, everyone I know dreads coming here with good reason.
They'll blame covid for their staffs behavior but sadly they've always been like this.
Other vets here will recommend vca ontario as a much better emergency option.
Vca San Diego is absolutely amazing and their entire staff will treat you wonderfully. VCA valley leaves a very bad impression on the vca brand.

As for here expect the worst and get a second opinion, they've been wrong too many times.</text>

Great help from the vets during a scary time with my dog. The receptionist at night were a bit harder to get to pass messages and left me on hold for a long time forgetting  I was waiting but my overall experience with the care for my dog was amazing. The vet and surgeon called me consistently with updates and answered any questions  I had. The vet even called me a week after having my fur baby home to check on her progress and answer  anything new questions I may hav for her home care. . I'm super thankful🙂< /text>

< Review>
I sadly bought a puppy from a breeder that ended up having problems. I bring her one day to this hospital they gave us 2 medications and an IV. Charged $300. Two days later our puppy declines after taking anti-parasitic meds they gave us so I make an emergency visit, I told them all I can afford is the visit please just tell me if there’s anything I can do about her medication regime. They say she’s really bad and running tests is gonna start in the thousands.  I said I can’t afford it. They said your next option is to open a credit card or euthanatize her. I asked can i take her to get treated elsewhere like Mexicali they said sure but we have to report it to Animal Control for negligence. Thanks for literally nothing<//Review>

<review>While their Covid protocol is in place, the rest of this facility is a mess. They over charge and care for you depending on your willingness to except that over charge. The phones and staff service are a joke. They will rattle off anything to get to the next call, even after you wait and were told you would be speaking to a doctor. After your long wait, the doctor is suddenly too busy I highly recommend you find another place to take your  beloved animal for proper care.< /review>< Pics>

If I had to sum up this facility in two words they would be: Absolutely horrendous. The staff here are unprofessional and dishonest people that only care about the bottom line.

When we arrived we were told that we were lucky that there were no other animals there and they could get my dog in for surgery right away (she was bleeding heavily from several puncture wounds caused by another dog).

They originally quoted us $4,000 for a wide variety of things that were unnecessary but we requested that they stitch my dog up and give her pain medication and antibiotics.

They then quoted us $2,000 claiming that the reason for the additional cost is for the 6 hour wait time caused by another surgery being done (which was a lie because there was no other animals there). We told them that was outrageous and we weren't going to be lied to.

We were then placed on hold for an additional 10 minutes while they adjusted the figures on their estimate and when they gave us the final estimate we were quoted THE SAME AMOUNT $2,000 but this time for only 2 hours of waiting. When I told her that was the same exact amount she quoted me before, she said "I can show you the receipt if you'd like".

We declined care after realizing they were horrendous people who were only concerned with squeezing out an extra $1,000 from a wounded animal and a family in despair. These people are providing a necessary service but they are absolutely disgusting and untrustworthy.

These sorts of business practices are illegal everywhere but health care it seems, they should be fined heavily and be put under investigation for their predatory practices.</Text>

My beloved 14 year old Sheltie,  Hannah,  became quite ill very suddenly on Thursday, and we called to get help. I knew I called the right place when the receptionist asked what was happening with my "baby".  We took Hannah in for an exam, and within two hours, Dr Carter called and shared the results of his exam. We talked over options, and possible causes,  and with heavy hearts, my husband and I knew it was time to let Hannah go to heaven. Every person was so kind and compassionate, Dr Carter, Juan the assistant, and all those at the front desk.  There is no  chance we would ever take our little girls anywhere else.<//Review>

I called about my dog yesterday (who is in obvious pain) and VCA Valley Animal Medical Center Emergency Hospital said to bring him in this morning.  I drove 40 minutes, parked, and then waited 10 minutes on hold after calling them from the car as instructed.  They again asked me my dogs symptoms and I told them the same thing I told them yesterday.  To my utter amazement VCA refused to see my dog, and told me to go elsewhere.

These people are unprofessional to the extreme, and should be avoided if at all possible.<//Review>

Took my puppy in with Parvovirus. They took my dog back and he sat there for hours without treatment due to payment and the fact that the doctor took five hours to get back to me to tell me the treatment that my animal needed and how much it was going to cost. Sent my daughter down with $700 that is seven $100 bills my bill was $604. Took my puppy in with Parville. They took my dog back and he sat there for hours without treatment due to payment and the fact that the doctor took five hours to get back to me to tell me the treatment that my animal needed and how much it was going to cost. Sent my daughter down with $700 that is seven $100 bills my bill was $604.45 the change I received back was $75.55 the change I was due back was $95.55. That is a $20. Difference. On top of Ripping me off for $20 they brought my puppy out to me along with the bag with the two IVs and his prescriptions and my paperwork and handed it to me just like that no instructions whatsoever on what to do. Thank GOD for YouTube!!! I had to look up on my own how to administer fluids under the skin on my puppy 🐶. Needless to say I will never go there again and I advise anyone never if you love your animal do not take them to this hospital!!!

Oh yes and before the owner or manager or whatever tries to respond and use the Covid virus excuse save it because you people can spread that virus all over the place with the your work ethics!!<//Text>

We had to come here for an after hours emergency, after a poor experience at Banfield. From their COVID-19 procedures, to the receptionist to the techs and vet we had a really wonderful experience. We felt informed, taken care of, and trusting. The vet explained what was going on very clearly and spent time answering our questions. The reception and techs were also kind and patient. We will be making them our primary vet when in Palm Desert. Thank you for caring for our little animal!<//Text>

<review>I've been here twice over the years, both times in the middle of the night.

Both times the dog ate something it shouldn't have.

Both times the service was wonderful at VCA in Indio.

One time they induced vomiting and it was expensive... but where else will you turn at midnight when you're pet's life may be at risk?

Tonight, the dog ate insect poison. When I arrived - the staff insisted that I called animal poison control.

At first, I was a bit miffed and just wanted them to make the dog throw up.

Now I understand they did me a favor.

Poison control confirmed the dog was in no danger from the amount ingested, and I saved what could have been a couple hundred dollar vet bill.

If this happens to you, consider making a donation to VCA instead :-)< /review><username>Matt M< /username></record>

I brought in a stray dog that I saw get attacked by a vicious German Sheppard.  She was severely injured.  Huge gaping tear in her neck.  This 24 hour hospital got her in very quickly despite the fact they were busy. The doctor, Dr Rick Klomhaus was incredible.  He took the time to explain all the options and did his best to keep the cost down knowing that this was just a stray and was not even my dog. However, I took financial responsibility for her and I'm so glad that I did. Some people think the costs are too high here but you have to keep in mind it's an emergency hospital. These people are working around-the-clock. And I can't speak for everyone but the staff there that I dealt with were very compassionate and responsive. I have 2 dogs at home that I will now start taking to Dr Klomhaus.  Happy ending, the little husky I found that was torn apart from this German shepherd is doing very well. And I have found a safe home for her. All is well because of this hospital and wonderful doctor and staff.</review>

< review>
Took my dog in at 3am and was admitted promptly, due to COVID-19 I was unable to enter with my dog. I was provided with an estimate and agreed. 10 minutes later I called back and asked to hold off on X-rays until we discerned whether iv hydration was working. I was informed the X-rays had already been done (over $500). I’ve never seen a vet at this clinic work that fast. Then I was shamed by the vet for not authorizing the radiologist fees to read the X-rays. I wanted to proceed reasonably.  Upon picking up my dog and handed the instructions the next day and after being home an additional day I phoned them as he had not improved. I had questions about everything. I was told a doc would get back to me. I assumed that day.  I finally called the next after that. The reception answered the phone like this “vcaanimalhospitalisthisanemergencypleadehold!!!!!”  I said it’s not an emergency if that’s what you just asked.” Frantically she repeated the same thing. It was actually rude. I was placed on hold 5 minutes. When she came back I asked to speak with a vet about follow up from the 3am visit and the previous days call with questions. I was placed on hold. 30 minutes later I hung up. I called back and got the same frantic receptionist. Dismissively,  I was told vets follow up with questions in 48-72 hours. It’s been 6 days and at 7:54pm I just got a voicemail from them that they are “very concerned” on how my dog is doing. NEVER take your animal to VCA Indio. This is unfortunately not my first experience with their horrible communication and follow up along with unnecessary and borderline deceptive cost communication practices when I questioned that speedy xray. But, it is now my last time going to this emergency clinic.  I have found an excellent vet in Palm Desert with wonderful communication, explained fees and quick follow up. It’s too bad this company is the only 24 emergency in town. Perhaps they don’t care because of that. $2000 later and a stressful HORRENDOUS Experience.

*** in response to their response below of my review:

It’s fascinating to me that a veterinarian doctor cannot call a fearful client with a sick pet back within 6 days from a $2000 paid vet visit. But, the clinic can post a heartfelt response to my google public review promptly within 8 hours.< /review>

This was the worst experience I've ever had at a vet hospital.  My cat went in with a fever and dehydrated she sat their for 10 hours with no antibiotics and no fluids till I ask for them and picked up and brought her home. They gave me no diagnosis until 2 weeks later they called with a uti diagnosis which I had already got from a vet friend of my the next day after I brought her home. High on billing very low on competence.  Next time I have an emergency I will go out of this valley to the next emergency hospital. Totally acceptable<//Text>

Our cat Bumble Bee's paw was bleeding profusely. It turned out to be a nasty bite. The staff cleaned her up and placed a little cast on her. We waited for a while in the reception, but that's to be expected in an emergency situation. Everyone was quite caring, despite our cat being a little crazy. A good result!<//Text>

Brought cat in for checkup only.

Don't bring pets after 4, they'll hold them until 6 to charge you the overnight stay. Given my information clearly, they completely ignored it as none of my contact information was right, and if I didn't contact them again there's no telling what could have happened. Waiting outside to pickup my cat now, Have been waiting for 15 minutes. Terrible place, terrible customer service. Wouldn't recommend.</Review>

I have had the misfortune to visit this Animal Hospital on 2 occasions in the past due to middle of the night emergencies with my little 2 pound Yorkie puppy. My first visit was because my puppy had Aspiration Pneumonia and the second time she was hyperglycemic and had fainted on me. During my first visit I came at 2 am because my puppy sounded like she was about to cough up a lung and I was accepted in, after paying $800 in order for them to do an x-ray, the vet doctor that was working with me was very harsh with her language and described what my puppy was dealing with as near death, which scared me to the point of crying...  and then I was presented with another $1,800 invoice to pay for her treatment. I don't live in the area as I was visiting my parents and needed to return home the next day (Sunday) and asked if the treatment can wait until I am back home with my regular vet. Of course the vet made it sound as though waiting was not an option. I had to pay $1,800 before they would officially admit her for services they weren't sure she would need. The next day (Sunday) I was called by another vet, who told me that my puppy was good to go home and that I just needed to give her antibiotics every day and perform steam inhalations for 10 minutes a day for 10 days or so.. Later when I took her to her normal vet he explained to me that my puppy was OK and that the aspiration pneumonia should not have been that big of a scare for me and didn't need to be made into such a big hospital stay.
A couple months later I drove with my puppy from Los Angeles to the Desert and after being at my parents house for an hour and my puppy walking around and being normal I found her laying down with a limp body and just whining to me as if she was crying for help. I called the breeder immediately as she has Yorkie's (obviously) and told me that she will always help if a situation with the puppies health arises. She immediately thought that the puppy either was hyperglycemic or hit hear head. I immediately gave her maple syrup on her gums as I was instructed and tried to warm her up and head to this VCA immediately because the condition was not improving. This was once again in the night time hours and upon arrival they took my puppy immediately, however they took my creditcard to pay for blood tests and IV liquids.
Later, while I waited the vet came into the waiting room, same vet as before, and proceeded to be very rude when I asked her to speak to the breeder, who was still on the phone trying to help me and was going to explain to me what the vet said. My breeder was telling me suggestions on how to proceed, but the Vet said that I would have to fork up $5,000 before they would do any tests, that the puppy needed x-rays, blood tests, and to stay for observation for the next 24 hours and also needed medication to be paid for.
I was crying and I didn't have that type of money to spend on things they weren't guaranteeing would be needed, I called my parents to see if they could help, but the vet would not accept a credit card over the phone from my parents.
Finally, the manager that was on that night came to speak with me and told me that I could see my puppy and that she was doing better. When my puppy came out she was herself again. The manager told me that in her opinion, my puppy would not need all the crazy tests and medications that the vet was suggesting performing and that, as I thought my puppy was in hyperglycemia and just needed more time to come back to herself. So I followed my gut on trusting that and seeing that my puppy was behaving normal again and took her home. I had to pay in the end $500 for the blood tests, oxygen tank, and IVY fluids.

I would not recommend this place to anyone.. They only think about how much money they can charge you! The vet doctors are rude, they over charge for everything and they will let you pet die in front of them if you don't pay the full price immediately for services they may not need to perform.<//Text>

After examining our dog they came back with an estimate of $800-$1000 dollars and would take 2-3 hours. The x-ray was going to cost $225, with another $175 for a "radiologist' to interpret the x-ray and $75 for an injection to "calm" our  lab down for the x-ray plus at least $200 for medications. We instead called a friend and went to her vet in El Paseo. We were done in 1 hour. The x-ray was $150 which the vet expertly interpreted without the help of a "radiologist". There was no injection necessary for their exam or x-ray. The medications were $65 and the exam by the vet was $65. VCA overcharges exorbitantly and plays on your desire to get your pet well. I would not recommend them unless they are the only place available and it is a dire emergency, but expect to pay unreasonable amounts.<//Text>< user>

She arrive there around 330pm but was sent home due to her dogs condition not being serious enough. They told her to bring him back in the morning because they were closing early due to looters. There are no protestor near the area and her dog has been visibiy sick for days but she was finally able to get a ride there since she has no car. Poor dog cannot breathe and  you can tell he is hurting. How can they just send her away like that?!<//text>< pictures>

<review>My goodness this place is terrible! The front desk staff is wonderful, and so was the vet tech who came out to get our pet. But holy cow, we had a very sick puppy who was puking and had diarrhea, we sat in our vehicle for 2 hours before they came and got her. They kept telling us someone was heading out to get her, after 30 minutes we would call, someone else was on their way out here. 30 minutes would pass and again no one came and got her, she was completely miserable and lethargic. We were expecting she would obviously need fluids and some medication, but we weren't expecting a $3000 vet bill. Dr. Foot's assistant was what made the whole experience 10x more stressful. We were already worried about our family pet, but her extreme rudeness was sickening. To think we couldn't be with our sick puppy, and she was stuck with care from such a heartless person caring for her. When I called to talk about the treatment plan for the second time (because she hung up on me the first time), she was extremely rude, and short. I tried very hard to be patient and understanding because of the current circumstances, but this has been the absolute worst experience from a vet office/hospital.

I believe if our poor pup didn't have to wait multiple hours to recieve treatment she would still be with us today. She was brought out to us in worse condition than she went in with. We get home, I gave her, her meds, and I called the assistant to ask if we should bring her back because she was getting worse.  She reassured me that she was fine,  she had a long day and needed rest. 2 hours later as my 3 kids were laying by her, she passed away.

If i knew all this would happen the way it did, I would have kept her home, instead of her being tortured by this place.<//review><rate>1< /rate>< pictures>

I don't know why this place has so many bad reviews. I had to take my cat in a little over 2 years ago and they were straight up with me and told me what I already knew, that I had to put my precious baby to sleep. The staff was extremely kind and caring and let me hold him while he passed. A few days later I got a card in the mail signed by everyone who worked there offering their condolences. Two days ago I took my dog to my regular vet and they basically said that he needed to be put down. So we took him to VCA in Indio yesterday and they said what he has is common and can be fixed with surgery. Everyone from the front office staff to the vet assistant and the doctor himself were nothing but stellar. No, they're not cheap but I'm a firm believer that you get what you pay for. And these people are worth it!! Thank you VCA for understanding my situation and helping me in my times of need.<//review>

<Text>One star is too many. We brought our dog in after her hind legs stopped working. We had a curbside appt, and Dr. Gilabert called me a couple of hours later to let me know that our dog had the option of a $5000 surgery, acupuncture 3 hrs away 3x a week, or euthanasia. She talked with me about our options, and said she would call the neurologist and get right back to me. An hour and a half later I still hadn’t heard from her and my dog was still inside. I called back and she wasn’t available, hadn’t gotten in touch with anyone, and hadn’t let me know anything. Just went onto the next patient and was done with us. I asked to take my dog home and for her to please call me when she was available. I haven’t heard from her. This is an emergency situation where our dog becomes more paralyzed by the day, and we got half an appointment and Dr. Gilabert wouldn’t even return a phone call. We are now basically watching our dog die in our living room and we can’t even get our call returned.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< GmapID>

We brought our dog danger in off of a recommendation from Animal Samaritans for a pretty large laceration on his side they were very cordial and understanding and although we were there for a lot longer than we anticipated they were pretty busy and we noticed that there were several emergencies that were brought in as we were waiting there was a couple of instances where dogs went in before us even though they didn't have an appointment nor were the emergency so that was frustrating but overall once we were in there and were attended to the service was caring and they took very good care of our dog we appreciate what they did for danger and look forward to him healing quickly at home and yes it was expensive it's compared to going to the emergency room for humans but overall it's good to know that there is an emergency vet when needed.<//Review>

< text>
Knowing only that my cat, Chester, was in serious distress, I took him to VCA as an emergency. It was quite busy, therefore a bit of a wait and it took a few tries to get through to let them know we'd arrived.  Considering the volume of patients they had, I still feel we were dealt with in a timely manner. (A staff member even brought cold bottled water out for those of us waiting in parking lot.) The staff that I had interactions with and those I observed were all professional and caring. And as busy as they were - they LISTENED.
Dr. Klomhaus - himself - called me and explained the issue and the gravity of the situation.  He was straightforward with his questions, explanations and suggestions. I know that it mattered to him that I understood, and I appreciate that more than I can say.
I was very worried about the fact that I knew that this was going to cost more than I had, and I let them know right away. Instead of turning us away, Dr.Klomhaus gave me a (deeply) discounted bill and Chester came home with the medicine and prescription food that he needed.
I thank God for Dr.Klomhaus and thank Dr.Klomhaus and crew for saving my cat.<//text>

I took my chihuahua here because we feared something was stuck in his food pipe. When they took him in they called us many times updating on his situation and telling us what what was going which relieved the stress :). Turns out he had an infection from swallowing something too big and he finished his medicine yesterday and is completely healed and happy!

<text>I took my cat Busik there because my vet wanted me to take him to see a specialist.
I am still confused about this place. Is it an Emergency hospital where real specialists can see your pet and you can get a second opinion? I am not sure. I was giving three options on how to proceed. Admit him into clinic for more tests, for around $7000, keep treating him with same meds or put him down. I chose to continue to treat him. I was giving a bill that included an oxygen treatment for my cat that didn't have any breathing problems. Most importantly I was there for almost six hours. Why? I still can't understand why I went there...I am sure they have great doctors and stuff...but to me it was not necessary trip and pretty much wasted time.< /text>< name>

<Review>My girl sophie got ran over last week we called them they told us they would be waiting for us. Sadly my girl passed on the way to the vet. When we arrived they took her in and where very kind and respectful. They prepared a room and let us say our goodbyes to our baby. They where nothing but kind. They told us our options and took care of everything for us. Yes they are pricey but that’s the normal fees to an emergency vet who is open 24 hrs. So thank you VCA for helping us with our Sophie.

Yesterday (4/16/2020) I called at 10:57am and spoke with a female regarding my 6 month old puppy’s last set of her very first vaccinations, which included rabies. Not booster shots. The original appointment was postponed due to the corona virus.  I asked if I could bring my puppy (LuLu Bear) in as a walk-in since they were only taking walk-in’s and emergencies...at first she said no thinking it was a dog needing a booster but  then realized it was my puppy’s first shots and stated they were very important and please come for a walk in visit and how important the vaccines were for my puppy’s health. At 2:41pm I arrived in Indio from Rancho mirage with my puppy and called them from parking per their request for virus protection protocol.  Spoke to Britney who was to say nicely, VERY rude.  She stated my puppy could go 8 months without last vaccines and was extremely pushy speaking down to me and throwing me on hold...when I tried to ask questions I got shut down and told I was wrong about the information I was given on the earlier call.  So, I was lying?  What??   Is Britney even qualified to answer questions regarding medical care?  Shouldn’t a vet tech been asked or a vet?  Luckily on the vets office phone line Is a wonderful recording right before you speak to someone...the recording states: recorded for quality assurance and training.  I hope management will pull these two calls: 4/16/2020 10:57 am and 2:41pm 5 and 6 minutes long.  We have spent thousands of dollars in our animals there and drive out of the way to use their office and get treated like this?   Never again and won’t refer anyone. Please coach this receptionist on manners.

One bad day and a thousand good ones with this place doesn’t deserve a review like I gave.  Apologies for not editing it sooner... As parents we all get a little over emotional when our babies are in need of help. Although I do believe the customer service needed some work everything else about them is perfect everybody has enough day hang in there you guys are doing great. Thanks for everything!</review>

Stray cat came to our house, very wounded! Possibly hit by a car or attacked. Terrible to see, called Valley VCA they said to come down. Upon arrival they rushed out and took the cat back for assessment. Unfortunately kitty was too injured to repair and recommended putting him down. All in all, they were very attentive and said it would be covered by the county! So glad they could help him find peace! Thank you to all the staff for all they do!</review>

Took our dog today. He has a cough and we knew it could be contagious so we voluntarily stayed outside. They were very attentive when taking our info then we sat for 3.5 hours. Finally they took us to what they called the infectious disease room. Which considering the name you would expect to smell like disinfectant. It wasnt even that clean. Footprints in dirt on the floor. Needless to say they were nice but the dr says she wants to do xrays we ask how much she tells us the receptionist will be in with the details but that they did have care credit we could apply for. She said it would be the bare minimum of xrays. The receptionist comes in and says dr wants xray of chest and throat and has meds to start on baring outcome of xrays. Then with a straight face says it will cost $800.  I said you must be out of your mind. We asked how much we owed for exam were told $72.50 or there abouts. So my boyfriend was very upset to begin with its his baby. So he wasnt in the mood to wait more just to pay these people. So he pjaced $70 on the counter told them name of our dog and left. Then as we are pulling out one of the people that work there had come running out to the car saying we still owed $2.50... Really? So he put $5 in her han d and said keep the change which she gladly did.... Never will i step foot anywhere near this place or tell anyone else to. I would rather drive to san bernardino to find an emergency vet.  HOW DO YOU PEOPLE SLEEP AT NIGHT... I can get xrays for myself for less then 800... All i was thinking on the way out was these poor people waiting they have no idea.  Dont bother answering there is nothing you can say that makes any of it ok. You just thought you could squeeze $800 out of another couple of people that were obviously concerned about their pet.. Shame on you.< /Text>

<review>Unable to leave a comment without giving them a star. Doesn’t deserve one star ⭐️

Took my dog to this clinic for his leg, waited over an hour.

They never took my dogs vitals , when asked about why such a long wait. The answer was we only have one doctor and he’s busy.

Another customer that came in 35 minutes after I arrived with her dog in a soft crate an the tech took her into a room immediately.

After waiting so long, I inquired if there were any other emergency vets near by.

The assistant said she didn’t know.

They weren’t to concerned when I said I was leaving.

Not especially pleased with this clinic.

Beware!!!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Review>The amount of money they charge and the service they give is unbelievable. Like many of these reviews VCA is strictly focused on Money. They preformed X-ray when we told them our dog had xrays two days prior. They preform and ultrasound and charged us $2600 flat. Couple hours later the vet looked at us strait in the face and said. I DONT KNOW WHATS WRONG. Then started asking us questions that relate to bronchitis. Although would not confirm only assume.  I have never in my life felt so taking of advantage. My wife is crying and they look at me and hand me a deposit slip for $2600 and could possibly go up to $3800. Well guess what still no definitive answer but they want another 24 hr treatment plan for $1300.  If you cannot give any info about the Expensive procedure they ask you to do. I cannot see how they can charge.  I have no problem paying for good service but goodness. We have been to three vets. $232 $1000 & $2400 none could diagnose our 1.5 year old weenie I pray god has mercy on the people behind the scenes that come up with these medical markups.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<Review>Gloria is the best part of our otherwise anxiety-driven experience.

The vet, by contrast, is clearly and understandably stressed out during these emergency hours, but she crossed the line by not wanting to listen to our request for a certain treatment and what followed. We get it, she’s the doctor so we listen to her authority. However we think our request for a certain treatment seemed to inflame her already stressed state. She stormed out of the room, kept us waiting for an hour, then returned with a laundry list of unnecessary and expensive tests etc. It seems like she may eat her feelings instead of talking and processing them. Hence, she wouldnt let us talk either. What would it be like to be her child? Not being able to express an opinion...

Without going into specifics, our pet is happy, healthy, and needed some preventative treatment for a minor injury.

Again, Gloria saved our experience. She appears to be a tech, front counter worker, and all around general manager and peace keeper - generally keeping it all running.  She is soothing while the vet is stress-provoking.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1553789188144, 'text': "While we appreciate your feedback about Gloria, we can tell you that our veterinary professionals pride themselves on always being courteous, attentive, and receptive to our clients' needs.

We took in our Pit Bull Terrier after she had been attacked by our other dog which left her a wound on her neck that looked inflamed. When we took her in, the vet (Kristi Medearis) came in and began to explain to us what she found/assumed she found. She went through the options. She told my mother and I that she recommended surgery to go in and check out the wound because there might be separation of skin from fat/muscle, or something along those lines, or that she could euthanize the dog. When she suggested we could euthanize her, she said it with a casualness that showed no empathy or compassion for our pet or for how afraid we were. The offer for euthanasia was given before she even knew what was truly wrong with her. The operation was estimated to be around two to three thousand dollars, something we could not afford so we opted to simply take antibiotics for her and hope for the best at home, given the circumstances. Before she was brought out to us, they said they had wrapped her neck with something to protect it and charged us almost forty dollars for gauze and self-adhering wrap. It's been a week and a day and Raven (our dog) is healing well, her neck no longer swollen and the bite only a scab now. She still has scabs where they shaved her neck, and we can only assume they shaved her haphazardly, with indifference and/or lack of skill. All in all, the place is only there for the money. They do not try to work with the human of the animal with payment plans unless you qualify for CareCredit. If you have an emergency and absolutely need a twenty-four hour vet, then go ahead, but don't come here if you don't have to. Their push for x-rays and bloodwork and other things seems manipulative and unnecessary, a ploy to get more money. They don't care for the animal -- money is their only concern.< /Text>

< Review>
Two months ago, my terrier mix was bitten by a Green Mojave Rattlesnake.  We arrived at VCA in Indio at 1am and they rushed Elmer to the treatment room. He was near death and I was given no false hope by the staff. All of his systems and organs were crashing. I never felt pressured from anyone at VCA to pursue treatment. If fact, one vet sympathetically told me that, even though Elmer's part of my family, treatment would be costly and even if the dog survived, there were quality of life issues to consider after a snakebite. I appreciated his frankness.

I pretty much said my goodbyes to Elmer during the one hour drive to the hospital, but for my own peace of mind, I decided to give him one round of antivenom just so that I could say I gave him a fighting chance. He's one tough dog. Although he was in a coma, his blood work showed marked improvement after the first treatment so we gave him another, then another. He remained in critical care for 5 days and to my delight and amazement, I was able to bring him home. He was very sick but has continued to show improvement every day. He has assumed his role as the boss of the pack and is even playing with the puppy. Most importantly, he's happy.

The doctors were kind and understanding during this stressful period and allowed me to spend time with Elmer in the treatment area. The technicians were supportive and professional and I felt like they were all pulling for my dog to survive. Even the cleaning lady came up to us during a follow up visit and greeted Elmer by name.

I'm grateful that my experience had a good outcome and I'm dismayed by some of the negative reviews. We had to wait a couple of hours for a follow up visit, which was frustrating, but I realize that some others may have been made to wait while the technicians were all working on my dog during those first few critical hours. Health care is expensive for animals, too.  I never felt like they were putting money before my dog's well being. Multiple antivenom treatments, blood transfusions, medications and around the clock critical care by well-educated professionals is expensive. VCA was upfront about the costs and I'll be paying this off for a while, but I'm so thankful that they were there when I needed them.< /Review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Text>On April 30, I took my little chihuahua, after examine her the veterinarian told me she didn't know what was the problem, she ordered x-rays,  blood and urine work to find out what the problem was, after running all tests she came back and kept telling me she still didn't know what the problem was because everything looks ok and told me to better bring her to a specialist but I should keep my dog with them in case she need it more oxygen. I paid a lot for the tests and when she suggested leaving my pet overnight I realized she was there only to drain the money out of you without giving you any reassurance your pet will make it. I took my chances and took my pet back home with me, worst night ever waiting for her regular veterinarian's office open, thankfully she made it and as soon as we arrived they started caring for her  after seeing the blood work results turned out she had an infection which was causing her seizures which was missed by VCA veterinarian</Text><name>G Santiago< /name>< Rating>

<text>$ the money more important than helping my little baby dog  I was prepared to pay a lot for my dog, but the estimated cost were outrageous. Clearly taking advantage of the situation rather than helping my dog.
Al contrario me dieron la vacuna para que el muriera , pero no pudieron ayudarme a salvarlo y dejaron que muriera😭😭😭</text></record>

Shame on you VCA. I am withdrawing my original 5 star rating and giving you only 1. My Mother-In-Law paid for the private cremation of our beloved cat Dixon over the phone, the DAY OF SERVICE with her credit card and you sent the amount to COLLECTIONS??? You stated that I disputed the charge and that's why you sent it to a scummy collection agency??? I sincerely hope the ghosts of Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Sadam Hussain, and Bin Laden haunt your dreams on a nightly basis.

EDIT: Turns out that there was a charge back to my M.I.L's Credit Card, as she closed and cancelled the card due to suspicious activity. However, VCA still sent the outstanding balance to a collection agency without even attempting to make contact with me to pay what was owed. I am upping to 3 stars for their wonderful care and attention and support to my beloved cat Dixon, but their billing department sucks., and I will stand by my last sentence in above review...but just for their billing department.</review>

< Review>
We recently went through a gut wrenching experience that emotionally hit us hard. Our Sasha was diagnosed with cancer, Melanoma. She wasn't in pain but the location of the tumor we could see was making it difficult for her to eat. She was very anemic and losing weight. The doctor said she may go within a week. A friend suggested CBD Oil for dogs. We tried this and she responded well but the inevitable reared it's ugly head and 2 and a half months later events lead us have to bring her in to say good-bye. I really felt bad for the Dr. who had to come in for the process of shots, my appreciation for the job you do that I could never do and kindness and understanding while we were grieving is very appreciated. The staff were so compassionate during this time when our family was emotionally down. We chose to have her cremated and keep her remains. It's tough to ask for money but this is a piece of the puzzle. I paid that day and less than 2 weeks later my daughter got the call they were ready. We received a very nice box, my wife already bought an urn but the box the remains were provided in is really nice. They provided a paw print of our beloved Sasha and yeah the tears started again. Our family cannot thank you enough the kindness we received from everyone.< /Review>

All of the staff is amazing, from the phone support to the vets. I have taken multiple cats there for routine veterinary care but I also had to put one of my cats to sleep there. The staff was SO kind and considerate. I can't speak highly enough of them. Thank you all for your kindness and care in every encounter.<//review>

We brought in our pet for diagnosis and paid the 69.75 fee, and left with and untreated pet and an estimate for treatment that soared in to the thousands ($4800-$6100).

Folks, do yourself a favor and get a second opinion if you have the time. The process at VCA is this: they size you up and then shake you down. I don’t know if they use demographics when determining the “estimates”, or possibly an algorithm that has to do with addresses and median incomes, but something is very off at VCA. It truly feels like the Route 66, middle of nowhere, mechanic... they know they are your only option. It’s a “How much money do you have?” kind of shake down. Only it is worse than that, as we are talking about life and death decisions for our pets.

We did get treatment for our sick pet elsewhere... It turns out VCA misdiagnosed our pet.  Had we not refused treatment there, our pet would have had an unnecessary surgery and possible complications or fatality as a result.

The many sad reviews and stories posted here are a testament to a huge opportunity for a caring and trust-worthy veterinarian to open up a 24-hour animal hospital in the Coachella Valley.<//Text>

Over the past week our shepherd cross developed serious health problems. She was an older, rescue dog who lived a wonderful life but sadly we had to let her leave us this past Monday.
We had two visits to this clinic and each time all of the staff and doctors were absolutely outstanding in terms of professional care, compassion and empathy, and clearly went out of their way to assist us in any way possible.
I am a health professional myself so totally related to their approach and cannot say enough about how grateful we were for their help at this sad time.</text><userid>102675545298236870023< /userid><GmapID>0x80daf85228e4e75f:0xf3c0302ed6b3c63c<//GmapID>< time>

This by far was the worst animal hospital I have been too The Dr. was very rude and had no idea what she was talking about not even sure if she had a real license. The staff has nice but that does not make up for the incompetent DR. Had to take our puppy to a real Doctor at desert dunes animal hospital the next day. The doctor there was very competent and corrected the issue right away. We will drive 100 miles to the next emergency hospital before we ever take one of our pets back< /text>

This place needs to be shut down. They care only about the business and not about the well being of the animals. My dog died not even 2 hours after seeing the doctor. Everyone needs to know about this. They deserve no stars and to be put down. They are fast to take all the money, but not fast to help your pet.

My boyfriend took his dog in last night 05/21/2018 and they told him they couldn't help his dog because he has a personal relationship to me (due to the fact that I made a complaint about the dog I described above). His dog had a dislocated disc during after hours and this company wants to protect the business but how about the pets. You should at least offer a waiver that people can sign .

Law actions need to be taken against this location and maybe even all of VCA.

You are so ignorant for copying and pasting the same response to all of the people sharing their opinions and experience .</Text>

I had to bring my 16 yr old boxer here since my regular vet was not in. They immediatly took her back to triag and assessed her because she was in alot of distress. We consulted with the vet and she was very good at expaining things to us. Never did she push us to run a bunch of test. Our Dollys condition was not good and we made the heartbreaking decision to euthanize. This was an agonizing decision to make and everyone there was so nice and truly, genuinely sympathetic. They gave us all the time we needed to say our goodbyes.  The technicians were very patient and kind. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place. I was charged the office visit and for the euthanasia  which cost less than it did to put my 17yr old Dacshound down.  To me their prices are no different than our personal Veterinarian. Thank you VCA Valley Animal Medical Center for making a heartbreaking situation easier.</Text>

Looking for a vet for my German Shepherd who's gone lame after running around on the field all day.  After reading these reviews I would NEVER go there.  Wow, you better get it together, because I'm from Maryland and other then being a bit pricey, the ER vets there get GREAT reviews.  You obviously have a problem with your staff, your vets and your ability to care for the pets and their stressed owners.  Reviews certainly changed my mind.< /Review>

<review>Although grateful that this VCA clinic is open 24 hrs., I must say that it is quick to make sure you purchase everything.  Yes, I love my dogs; however, diagnosis by the emergency vet does not align with what my primary vet states.  It’s like saying my VCA vet is misleading me. Two stories not good, and leveraging your weakness at the same time.  My advice. Don’t buy medications from the emergency after hours clinic unless your animal would DIE like today without taking it. Your primary vet knows your animal’s health best.  In other words, use more common sense than I because you will not be able to return that expensive drug once you discover it’s not necessary. That sucks due to CA law.

The staff is friendly, but I can sense a cutting too.  It’s an interesting dichotomy to say the least.< /review>< Time>

They shouldn't even get a star. Dealt with them at two separate locations. Indio and Rancho Mirage. Rude and nasty. Felt as if they could care less about the health problem I had with my dog. The office staff needs to be taught manners and how to deal with people, because they have none. I will never take any pet there again.< /review>

< Review>
We had an incident with our do around 4 in the morning. After searching on line we were surprised to find VCA in Indio was the only 24 vet. We arrived around 5. After filling out a form we were told the wait would be about 45 minutes as it was shift change and the doctors were doing rounds. After about an hour wait a doctor came in to examine our dog. We were trying to explain that we felt that based on what happened we thought he had an allergic reaction to something. The doctor kept focusing in on him vomiting but we kept trying to explain what had happened and how we were more concerned about his sneezing and breathing. She did a cursory exam and then left to work  up a treatment plan, The tech came back with a plan for a shot for nausea, multiple xrays and a radiologist report that would cost almost $800 dollars. We asked to discuss it with the doctor but were told we had already talked to her. Our main concerned was what sounded like wheezing to us so we asked if the doctor heard anything. The tech did not go ask her but said he did not hear anything when he listened. My husband and I discussed it and asked for his symptoms to be treated including Benadryl  for the sneezing and possible allergy. Our bill ended up being approx. $260. Other than still sneezing our dog seems to be fine and not in need of expensive X-rays. I feel they use the emergency patients as a way to make money. We paid $150 for 5 minutes of the doctor’s time. We will see our regular vet it needed. It is unfortunate that there are no other options for emergencies in the area.
Update: I emailed the person suggested by the owner in his response. I did dot receive a response after 5days. Very disappointing.< /Review>

<review>We were sent to VCA by our vet with our Mini schnauzer with extremely high glucose levels. When we got there we were very concerned and I feel that they prey on those emotions. They gave us an estimate of $2400 said we needed to pay a deposit which was $2400 immediately. They estimated he would be their only until the next day and when he got sicker during the night they called us and said they would call us again for another estimate for him to stay a few more days. At this point my husband and I got in our car and drove over and demanded to see not only our dog but also speak with the vet. After seeing our dog and how miserable he was we made the excruciating decision to put him to sleep. We were questioned by the staff and made to feel almost guilty about making that decision. I have no idea how many more thousands of dollars it would have been to keep him there. This is our only option here in The Valley and it is a horrible 1. All they care about is the money not the animal and they should be shut down.< /review></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This place is the worst! I brought my pug in late at night with an eye injury/his eye had come out of it’s socket. It is so important to act quickly in this situation, the eye needed to be put back into place as quickly as possible to minimize the damage. This is supposed to be an emergency hospital but Kristi Medearis chose to do nothing! Instead of doing the right thing, she stalled and tried to convince me that an expensive eye removal surgery could be a better option. Once she realized that I could not come up with the 2700. in the middle of the night she began to belittle me, repeatedly referring to me as “people with money problems”.  By the time she “tried” to tend to his eye, she said she couldn’t do anything, it had become too swollen. Too much time had gone by. She then suggested that I consider surrendering my dog.
I knew I had to get him out of this place, they did not care about my dog at all. The $775. bill that I paid that night was full of bogus fees and a “miscellaneous professional service fee”....Disgusting!
Fortunately, I was referred to an amazing Veterinary Hospital in the morning. A very skilled and compassionate DVM fixed my pug, she even saved his eye.
My heart aches for any animal or pet owner who has to go through this. Unfortunately, there are so few choices when something happens to our pets at night. Please beware of the VCA in Indio, the focus is on $ NOT the animal.</review>

Overall, I think their professionalism, attention to detail and customer service is poor.  After $1,700 in treatment etc., a test for lyme disease was ordered on Thursday and she was started on doxycycline which is a strong antibiotic and is great in case she has lyme disease, but if she doesn't have lyme disease, she absolutely shouldn't be taking it.  Due to their advice, we took her to a vet in Ontario, CA (their service is REMARKABLE!!) for further diagnosis and treatment.  Found out her test was sent out on Saturday....why???  Test takes several days, so she has to take a potentially harmful medication longer.  There is more to the story, but never got a call back from a vet. I have seen on some reviews that this vet  will respond to some of the poor reviews, instead of responding to mine, here is a suggestion, when people are spending a lot of money trying to save their loved on...CALL THEM, KEEP THEM INFORMED, DON'T JUST HAVE THE DESK CLERK SAY THEY DON'T KNOW WHY THE TEST WASN'T SENT OUT UNTIL SATURDAY AND HAVE A NICE DAY.   At Ontario, they have initiated a phone call to us approximately 6 times over the past 2 days.  VCA in Indio has  low Google rating because you earned it!<//Review>

< Review>
Horrible experience. Took my poisoned dog in with internal bleeding. Sat in lobby with NO ONE else waiting ahead of me for 2 hours.  Then they put me in an exam room and said the vet would be with me shortly.  An hour later and I'm still sitting in the exam room.  Went to front desk and told them vet needed to take care of me immediately or I would leave.  The receptionist said fine, go. Up all night till a local vet opened at 8 am(carter animal hospital) walked in wo appointment and they took him to the exam room within 15 minutes, did blood work, had him on a saline flush and treated with poison antidote and I was on the way home at 915 am.  Never go to VCA clinics.  They are the bottom of the pit and the people staffing them don't know what they are doing.  I agree with a previous poster.  They should be shut down.  File a complaint with the state vet board Like I have done to close this dump down<//Review>

After a recent serious accident with our dog, we took him to the VCA Valley Animal Medical Center Emergency Hospital. As far as we are concerned, this place saved the life of our dog. The surgeon, Dr. Trousdale was incredible, caring and considerate; the staff amazing. Kudos to Seth, Ashley and Jonathan to name a few. While our dog is still recovering and the long term rehab uncertain  -we are so incredibly grateful - words can not describe their love and attention for our pet Rufus. 5 stars.<//Text>

Service was terrible. The lady at the counter was rude and arrogant. The price ranges are just so ridiculous. $150 to ONLY see the vet. We had an emergency, and the lady there was being completely rude. Terrible service and place. There was a guy earlier who told us that he waited for 3 hours, without them telling him anything. Just complete wow. Never going there ever again.</Review>

<review>The vets at this VCA saved my beloved dog nearly a year and a half ago after she suffered a venomous bite from a Western Diamondback.  I brought my little 9 1/2 pound Chiweenie in on a Friday night in May.  She was already in extreme pain, swelling, with visible bleeding from her snout.  The doctors were calm, knowledgeable, and methodical in their treatment throughout the night.  I received regular calls from each vet on call into the early hours of the morning as we discussed how to proceed.  After 3 vials of antivenin, iv, regular monitoring of blood work, and amazing care, my precious dog came home that Sunday afternoon.  Yes, it was expensive. However, I know they saved my dog's life, and I am grateful!  Jennifer S.<//review>< pictures>

<Text>I am amazed at  how up and down the reviews are on this site.  My experience was as follows.  My Am Staff came in the house right after we went to bed, she has a doggie door and comes and goes as she pleases, I heard her throw up and turned on the light and the left side of he head was swollen up big time, she was having trouble breathing, I called all the vets I knew in Imperial Valley and finally got a hold  of one who was out of town but told me to give here benadril to slow the swelling and he recommended VCA in Indio which is almost two hours from us.  Well we were out of options so at around 10PM away we went, when we got there we were immediately served.  The vet took our dog in, gave her a shot and watched  her for an hour, she was much better so we took her home arriving at 3AM.  Long night
Bottom line VCA was courteous, efficient and considering the hours reasonable would give them at least four stars, I just wish they were closer<//Text><Rate>4<//Rate><userid>110151844310763880750< /userid></record></dataset><record>

This is a terrible place for any pet owner. Please stay away as YOUR PET COULD DIE as a result of their negligence and incompetence.  On Monday evening, I took in my  pug of 7 years old due to him swelling up from his rear, complications when attempting to go potty and infection around that area. He was fine on Sunday, so I knew right away this was an emergency situation.  I could not get same day appointments with our regular vet or other vet clinics in the valley. I  scheduled appointments for Tuesday but decided to visit this 24 hour pet hospital since it was clearly an emergency situation. They told me he was overheated and the swelling would go down over time. They charge me $165 for the visit and told me we could go home. The next morning, he did not look any better and the swelling became worse. I had my first scheduled appointment on Tuesday at 3:00 p.m. The new place I took him to, told me that he had an enlarge prostate and had become infected. His bladder was full of urine and was about to explode. He could have died if I waited more time to take to a vet. He needed an emergency surgery to remove the fluid from his bladder and glands. He stayed overnight. The clinic called me today that they could not perform surgery on him and the best thing to go is put him down. His prostate became over inflamed due to the electrolytes injected by the VCA.  He did not need any more liquids. This cause his prostate gland and abscesses to rupture. If he would received proper attention on Monday evening by VCA he possibly could have been saved. Now our family lost our beloved pet. I have to tell my five year old son his dog has to be put down. Please avoid this place at all costs.</text>

I found staff to be competent, caring and professional. And the vet herself was nothing but compassionate as she worked with me to try to find a solution for my dog's Irritable Bowel Disease.

Tests are expensive everywhere, and this vet is no exception; however, they were done quickly and results were immediate, giving me invaluable information that helped me make decisions. I did wind up having to put my beloved little companion to sleep after all the medications quit working, and I can tell you they were wonderful to me and to my dog. The vet had tears in her eyes and said good-bye with me as I held him and felt him slip away. A sad, inevitable part of life, made easier by people who really care.</Text>

<text>The care my pet received was competent, but they seem to take advantage of a stressful situation and recommend unnecessary and expensive procedures.  My pet was treated for a bite wound and was sent home with an expensive prescription for a liver medication not remotely related to the bite wound.  My primary care vet said it was totally unnecessary given the age of the pet and the liver enzyme which was elevated wasn't that elevated, but the VCA vet said 'could be an indication of cancer', which is alarming.  They also sold me a $150 bacteria culture to ensure the pet was given the right antibiotic, but it takes 5-7 days for the results--my pet is responding fine with the current course of meds, so that was another wasteful and unnecessary procedure.  Next time I will go to the emergency vet in Banning which is not part of VCA and doesn't appear to have profit as their only focus.  If you do have to use VCA make sure you question every charge and don't be intimidated to decline them if they don't seem justified.< /text>< pics>

I've heard a lot of bad comments about this clinic. We were in need of an emergency vet care for our dog last night. We called n they told us to get there now. My service dog was having grand mall seizures. His health had been going down hill and he suddenly could not get up and was having seizures.  We are seniors and have a very limited income so we did not have the money to do costly tests n treatment that more than likely would not do anything but prolong his life but not with quality of life. So we sadly made the choice to let him go.
The staff was compassionate and allowed us to do the right thing for our seriously ill dog.  We are sad but know we made the right decision.< /text>

Was a little standoffish at first coming here after reading these reviews but I’m so glad we did.
Our poor Lyla had gotten into something and her face was swelling. We called and asked if they could see her and they of course said yes bring her in. We had to drive an hour from where live due to this being the only emergency animal hospital close to us but we brought her in anyways. We were there for about an hour and a half however we were spoken to by 4 different people all keeping us updated! The Vetenarian Kristi was amazing and came in and explained everything to us, got her some shots to help the swelling and reaction. And 15 minutes later we got our sweet happy pup back!
Of course it was a bit more pricy than a normal vet visit due to it being 1am and at emergency hours but they were so attentive to Lyla and to us that spending the money to make sure she was okay wasn’t a problem!
I would totally recommend people to come here for emergencies especially! Just a special shout out to Kristi and Janay for being so kind to my husband and I and treating Lyla as if she were theirs!<//Text>

My Dog was hurt badly, I believe they knew he would not survive yet they performed many expensive procedures while telling us he would live,he did not I visited him and he was awake and standing up less than 10 hours before he died, IF  they played any role in his premature Death and I Said IF, Then I hope all there's lives are filled with  unlivable pain for the rest of their natural lives.
I hope all the employees at this facility feel the pain and anguish I fell over the past few years, I wish nothing but misery and bad luck to all of them!

None were open or would take an emergency visit on christmas day. I heard of VCA and rushed over. The vet and nurses treated us so kindly and seemed genuine when they were discussing what my cat might need. In the end i couldnt afford it and they helped me try to get pet insurance to cover it. I was unable to get the insurance. So i had to take my cat elsewhere. A male nurse with a funny name even gave us gas money to make it back home. (I couldnt thank him enough) These people do work hard and care about the pets coming into their unlike all the other vets i went too. However their young blonde female receptionist was rude to us, and had terrible customer service skills. She made us feel bad for not coming in sooner and for even going in on christmas day. I lived in el centro with no car and had never even heard of this place until someone told me about it and we immediately made the trip over to Indio. I did everything i could for my cat. I just wish he were here today. He showed no symptoms until it was too late. I want to thank everyone from the bottom of my heart for going to work on christmas day in 2016. I know its frustrating and stressful when your work goes unappreciated.< /Text>< pics>

Good veterinary services are hard to find, most are all about the money. Not Dr. Truesdale. He is wonderful, the staff is great and there is more concern for your animal them your wallet. Other vets ought to take a lesson from this wonderful veterinary clinic and hospital. They have called to check on my girl every week. Dr. Trousdale visits the closest city to my home about every 5-6 weeks. They called to let me know when so I could bring my KatieBear to see our hero. He's the best and so is the clinic. *****<//Text>

<text>I spend over 2000 dollars and they killed my dog!!!.. My dog was having complications so we took her here. The doctor came out she said the dog was in bad shape and they coulda anything until I sign and pay infront. They did nothing but sedate my dog and waited to die in there. Her sugar levels were high and they said they were going to control it by lower it little by little. I pay them 2000 and a hour pass thwy came back and told me “we need to start the treatment” so we are ganna need you to sign a second waver that I needed to pay $5000 on top of what I gave them before to start the treatment. I said WHAT?! So what have you been doing all this time?They said they were treading her but when I went back I saw my dog in a bed sedated compulsing with no one around and no one taking care of my poor baby. She die after a few hrs so I took her home. I came back to pick up my dog collar (the last thing I had left of her) and they didn’t have it. I waited for 2 hrs and they throw it away! The manager said we don’t have it but wait for it they told me they could give me 50 dollars back as an apology and I told them “is this a joke?” I was furious and so disappointed that the only memory from my dog was thrown away like a meaningless pice of trash. Imagine someone dying and the doctor telling you oh yea we throw everything away because it die. That’s how I felt and I don’t want anyone else to go through what I had< /text>< Pictures>

I have been to this vet 2-3 times. a few years back I took my 3 yr old Chow in about 4 years ago. He wasn't eating, and very lethargic. They tested him for Parvo. They said he tested positive and that it would cost over a 1000 dollars to start treatment there in the clinic. I was also told I could take home meds and treat him. That would cost $500. I opted to do that. Then I thought "I can't afford this. I paid for my   doctors visit and left, without any medication. I sobbed all the way home. The next morning my dog was perfectly healthy again. We took him to our previous vet in San Bernardino, (where we use to live) he said  this dog doesn't have anything wrong with him. He probably ate something that disagreed with him.  First of all, I hate to think I would have paid all that money,  and 2nd, what would that medication do for a perfectly healthy dog. Worst scenario would have been if he'd been put down. Totally misdiagnosed my dog. Only after Money.

Last February (2018) we took our Chiwennie in because she was having seizures. It was after hour so emergency fees of $150.00 is charged for just walking in the door. Then 3 hours later after they gave her some meds we needed to see the vet. we sat and waited another hour.  Finally we spoke to the vet, they really didn't have any answers. I decided to take my dog with 3 days worth of meds. (knew I could get meds cheaper on line) and left. This cost us $375.00. They didn't say what caused this condition, but they were prescribing her meds to be taken daily. My dog hasn't had anything like a seizure since February, (6 months ago) . Obviously no meds were needed. Seems like a guessing game to them and our animals suffer the consequences. In 2 visits meds were prescribed and both times they weren't needed. My dogs are healthy, but not from anything this place did. It's shameful they're still in business. From reading the reviews of others, the bad out weighs the good here. Stay Away.</Text>< username>

I cannot share enough praise and thanks for the staff, vet techs and veterinarians at VCA Indio. My cat, Spidey, swallowed a needle and thread and needed an x-ray, then an emergence endoscopy and ultimately abdominal surgery (they saved him! He’s ok!)

This all happened between 10pm-3am, and I was distraught, anxiety-ridden and exhausted. Everyone at VCA was not only knowledgeable and helpful, but also incredibly compassionate towards me in my messy/sorrowful state. They were clear and concise with my options and explained processes in a comprehensible way. It’s amazing to have someone meet you where you’re at mentally. I’m sure I asked them to repeat explanations 100x but no one ever seemed to tire of me. They were SO helpful with billing, and helped me figure out my pet insurance (Trupanion, who were also amazing). It’s worth saying that they also have options for those without insurance, a credit card w/a high interest rate but a 12-36 month period to pay off debt before that kicks in.

Spidey was SO well taken care of. I felt that they showed him just as much love as I would have, and because of the swiftness and expertise of vet techs, the vet, and the surgeon, Spidey made it out of a very dangerous mistake with his life intact.

Recovery was really intense with him at home, and I had lots of questions for the folks at VCA. He had an unexpected bump of swelling and I had other Qs as well, anytime I called, someone was able to speak with me briefly to give instructions in less than 5 minutes of hold time on the phone.

VCA staff, vet techs, Spidey’s many vets, and especially Erica, we cannot thank you enough. We owe you his life, and I will always appreciate your love and care towards us both.</review>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Worst dog hospital ever. They wanted to put my dog down after it ate ibuprofen saying that she was in pain and that we are putting her threw pain. Well we almost put her down for almost 450$.! Yea it was extremely high, and they haven't taken her blood to see if she was   dying. Just put her down and give me your money. Then on top of everything they wanted me to shut my dog up (quote) because she barked to much. I could not imagin the torture they would have put her threw before they put her down. He was a bald short man with tattoos. And a Hispanic female assistant. In the end we waited till morning which they said was impossible to do, and took her to a vet in desert hot springs. They were close to closing on a Friday when they immediately took my dog and began to flush her body and take blood samples. Before I paid or gave them my information. I was so grateful that I didn't listen to the
incompotent staff that call them selves Veterinarians. If you love and care for your pet NEVER BRING HIM/HER HERE....<//Text><Time>1472948363258< /Time>< Gmap_id>

<text>Took my sick dog in at 5:30PM to the Rancho Mirage location!  They are open until 7PM.  They tell me I have to take him to the Indio location because it was too close to closing time to be able to help my dog.  I take him to the Indio location and get there at 6:10.  They wanted to charge me Emergency rates because it was 10 minutes after 6PM.  I explained that I was sent by there other location, which was open until 7, and they did not care.  The receptionist was cold and had the attitude that she did not care what so ever.  If that is a reflection on there service I would NOT take your animals there.

< Review>
Back in october 2015, i brought in my best friend, a black lab named Duke...he had difficulty breathing & his belly was swollen. The vet assistant did the preliminary check & with out hesitation he retrived one of the on-duty vets & they took Duke to the emergency area to provide oxygen for him as he was suffocating due to internal bleeding. This devistated me to no end because i knew this was the end of my best friend Duke's life....the Dr's, vet assistants & front reception staff all helped to make a heartbreaking situation a little easier to bare, because we had to make the decision to put him to sleep due to his in-operable condition. Thank you VCA hospital for not only being professional, but caring & very helpful during one of the worst days of my life...the death of my best friend, hunting companion, & family member Duke.<//Review>

The only reason I didn't give 5-stars is because of a previous experience we had with this VCA location. The first time we brought our dog in after a dog bite we saw Dr. Kingsley and when we didn't go with the invasive and expensive surgery that she wanted us to do, she did 3 tiny staples to close his wound and sent us home with a packet of antibiotics. Our regular vet was surprised that there were only 3 staples and when we came back into the VCA after our dog re-injured the area, the staff there seemed surprised that he only had 3 staples for a wound of that size. Our 2nd experience was with Dr. Baumgard and his assistant Rebecca, who were absolutely amazing and took care of our dog from the moment we arrived until they called for us to pick him up after they cleaned him up and SEWED the wound shut. This is the treatment he should have had from the very beginning. This option was not offered to us during our first visit. I will come back to this location ONLY if Dr. Baumgard is on duty. I have absolute confidence in him and the services he provides to his patients. I would recommend him and Rebecca to anyone. This is the type of care you HOPE to get for your dog in an emergency situation.</text>

When my son asked if the doctor could just prescribe an anti-biotic or something to help the cat breath better until it could be seen by its regular doctor on Monday, the doctor refused. What is the emergency fee visit for? To diagnose the cat but not treat it without additional exhorbant charges?

<Review>Came to this VCA location despite everything i hear about VCA staff not truly caring for animals well being and there services being unreasonably exspensive. My terrier mix ingested 18 ibuprofen pills and had not been showing signs of being affected by them.All other vets had already closed and this was the only location that was still open and was 24 hours.So i find myself here where upon speaking with the lady at the front desk they are already telling me it would be cheaper to put her down rather than seek care. I came to this terrible place to try and save my dogs life. I would have stayed home and let her die in comfort if that was the case. So I get talked into applying for carec redit and I get approved and both the females that are part of the night staff seemed to be excited ,money makes these people move.They then began to weigh my dog and get a room ready for us. After speaking to the veterinarian and waiting for them to prepare bloodwork and have me call a poison control center, that charged me 65$ to tell me nothing, I begin to get restless and concerned. Leah ,my dog, seems to be uncomfortable and continously is barking. The assistant also  makes a comment that she is like that because they took her temperature when they weighed her using a thermometer for your butt and is laughing when he says this. I begin to think to myself am I really going to trust this creep with Leah? Hell no!! So I tell the lady at the front desk with glasses that I no longer want to seek care using your vet . The vet would like to speak to me ,Im sure to try and convince me to spennd money there but send his assistant to tell me and not himself. Leah at this point is barking at the assistant who enjoys the discomfort dogs get when a thermometer is in there butt.He starts to tell me"" this is a hospital your dog cant be barking like that" and tells me to "you have to tell him no" "yank his leash" and trys to show me how to yank a dog so it hurts the dog. I give the guy a look and start to leave he then says "your going to leave?" "are you serious?" . I reply "your complaining about my dog" "So yeah I'm going to take her outside." "I'm coming back" . He says "your not telling it no" You have to tell them". Before heading out the door I stop and firmly tell him "Don't tell me how to take care of my dog". "Are you serious" he says I then walk out and return to my car where my family is waiting and I say lets go. The following day I took Leah to my local veterinarian hospital in Desert Hot Springs where they immediately began to give her care when i walked in the door withtout even verifying I coukld afford it. They even went as far as too stay after hours with Leah to make sure everything was going well. This is the care you expect when your dog ,who is as much a part of my  family  as my 15 year old sister is, is in critical condition. Bottom line VCA is all about their money and isn't nearly as proffessional and caring as other places in the desert valley. I would go here only if it meant life or death otherwise steer clear of this chain of vets.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1472506702127, 'text': 'Erik, your review is disappointing to read, as our team is held to a standard of offering the highest in compassionate and professional care.

I dont even know where to start. My pitbull puppy ate a pack of gum and we rushed here it was during emergency hours so we had to pay to take my dog in.
2. Dr. Was in a bad cranky mood. Seemed not to care.
3. We were there for hours not knowing what was going on.
4. They made ME call poison control which was 65$ ,they gave me the number wrong 3 times!( they should have called themselves)
5. The fact that they didnt know what to do so they had me call poison control says it all.
6. After they enduced my pup to trow up she came out perfectly fine, But! They tried convincing me to waste MORE money to get her all this other unnecessary stuff.
7. Seems to me they dont even care about your dog they just care about the money.
8. Only good thing was the office lady was nice.
I dont like talking bad about a place but this place was ALL BAD .
We came her one more time to give it a last shot(hoping for the best) to check out some bumps my dog had and they told us they didnt know what they were , which was soo un helpful she was given some pills and shampoo and it made no difference. Regret coming here .</Text>

This was the worst place ever. My daughter took her dog there they said the dog sprained his leg with no xrays done just an exam for 200.00. The dog was still hurt a week later so my daughter wemt back asking for xrays of left leg. They sedated the dog once with permission three hours later and multiple doses of sedation without informing my daughter they came in with xrays of right side and tried to say they could see through to the left side.  Then they had to give the dog medication to bring him out of sedation. Now its going on five hours and still waiting to get xrays of left side. Then they want us to pay for their obvious mess up. Im looking for the owner of this place because they need to be shut down.< /Text>

I had one of the worst experiences ever at this vet clinic. When I expressed concern about the bill being high the vet first said I could try taking my dog to Mexicali for treatment or that she would EUTHANIZE MY DOG FOR FREE. PLEASE PAY ATTENTION IF YOU HAVE TO TAKE YOUR PET HERE, THEY HAVE NO CARE AND CONCERN FOR ANYTHING BUT THEIR DOLLARS.</text>

Our little guy had hernia surgery here and 6 weeks later he is still having a problem with leakage . But we have to pay another $500 so they will take care of him after they did the surgery  !!!! After calling to see if we can get him to get checked out 6 weeks later when he started leaking .   It's yes bring him in . 2 1/2 hours later after waiting they charge us $500 !!! To take care of  an ongoing problem  . Unbelievable  !!!!!! My wife and my little guy have now been there for over 2 1/2 hours to take care of a problem that is a problem after having the surgery . I don't think they need to be shut down as someone else mentioned . I think perhaps new management is the answer . In the Las 2 months we have spent over $2000 dollars here so I think I should be able to speak my mind ........    if management has a problem with that please let me know . I see a lot of reviews on here all bad . That's to bad .< /Text>

<rating>1< /rating><resp>{'time': 1622236897347, 'text': 'Jeremy, we realize your frustration and apologize for the circumstances which led you to this review. I would like to know more about your recent experience at the service department to prevent this from happening again and hopefully repair our relationship with you. If you could message us and provide me some more detail, we would greatly appreciate it. Thank you, we hope to hear from you soon.'}<//resp><text>This review is primarily for the AC service department. I have been loyal to this dealer and have placed my trust in them to service my mustang thus far, but I am utterly disappointed by the quality of service I have received for my last two "repairs". I brought my mustang in to address an AC problem in January this year and was told I needed two hoses, and the AC compressor to be replaced for ~ $2000 dollars. Upon getting my car back I opened the hood to find a bungie cord still attached in my engine bay, completely lazy and unprofessional work. Of course I let that slide at the time because I know these things can happen, not knowing this was a sign to come.

The AC still was not working after that repair, and after bringing it in again I was told that the actual problem was a blend door actuator. So that was the first misdiagnosis. I get the car back and the AC is still not working, despite Sandy and the service team saying that they made sure to check everything. So $3000 dollars wasted because the service technicians can't check the TSB's to see that the evaporator core is faulty for these cars and needs to be checked/replaced first, although that requires removing the dash which must be too much work despite my $250 inspection fee. My patience and loyalty feel taken advantage of.

I would like a refund for the misdiagnosis (twice), and wasting at least a week of time with back and forth communications. Until then, I can not recommend service at this dealership and will be taking my mustang elsewhere.<//text><gmap_id>0x808fa3af2ada5b43:0x1dd8cce738cc0a5d<//gmap_id><Time>1622169601803</Time>< pics>

Although they had minimal staffing because of the holiday, they inspected my car and got the work finished within a couple of hours. It was warranty work so no cost to me, but was treated greatly and everything was communicated very well. They even washed the car for me... bonus. Huge difference from the other Ford dealer on the peninsula (DC). Thanks to Alex for the great service and taking care of my issue so promptly.<//text>< Name>

I have had to take my vehicle back to Towne Ford 4 times in 2 months for warranty issues. These items still have not been completely fixed and I will need to bring it back again. The only reason I give two stars and not one is because they get my vehicle into the shop quickly.</Review>

Bought a 2015 CMax here.  Couldn't get the deal done on the first visit, but after couple weeks of follow-ups by the salesman David and Sales, was finally able to get a fair discount for a nice clean car and fair mileage.  The dealership had some great selections comparatively to other places I was shopping.  The cars here all seems well maintained, and also priced marked competitively.

I'm happy the sales team was persistent about getting the deal done.  I got the color I wanted .  David was straight forward and explained all the options and most everything well.  I was quite pleased with David's service considering after all, it's a car dealership.

The paperwork in whole did take a bit of time.  It was there close to 3.5+ hours to get everything ran and signed.   I suppose that seems on par with most other dealerships anyway.  Its always a bit of a grind purchasing any car overall.

Overall, I'm very happy about my purchase here at Towne Ford.  The experience was pleasant and I would certainly give them a strong consideration if I will be in market for another Ford again.</text>

My company was looking to replace one of our older pickup trucks and I called Jay Minto at Towne Ford to assist us in our search. Jay put me in contact with Steve Powell to handle our transaction. He offered us several options, provided all the specifications, pictures, rebates and pricing, before he even looked at our trade-in. He made the entire process simple, quick, and painless. The 2020 F150 Super Crew we selected was nicely equipped with the 3.5L EcoBoost Engine and 10speed automatic transmission. The power and performance is fantastic even when towing our trailer. The ride is smooth and the cab is quiet with plenty of space. Thank you Steve and Jay!<//review>

Francisco was my sales guy, he helped me get a fair value on my trade in from out of town and reserved the truck I really wanted overnight for me to come and pick up. The manager Armando was very friendly and accommodating helping me get financing secured over the weekend while my credit union had delayed approving me.

10/10 experience, and would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a quick and straightforward car buying experience.< /review>

Took our 2010 Ford Escape in for routine maintenance, and for a recurring Brake System Warning light (that I suspected was simply a faulty light - not an actual problem with the brakes). Routine maintenance was fine, and we paid a significant amount for the brake system check. After about two weeks, the same light came on again; always at random times. Along with that, the Tire Pressure warning light would sometimes come on. No problem with the pressure - just the light.
I went online and chatted with someone (a bot?), described the problem in detail, and they assured me someone from the dealership would call me back to arrange a re-evaluation and a fix. Never happened. I gave it another week or two and did the same thing - chatted with the bot. The bot assured me someone from the dealership would call me back, etc., etc. Never happened.
The car drives fine. Those warning lights just come on from time to time. But we've never heard back from anyone at Towne Ford. We'll likely be going elsewhere for service in the future, and if we choose to purchase another Ford, it won't be from Towne.<//Text>

<review>My son bought a pre-owned Subaru Impreza from Towne Ford. From the first interaction via an Autotrader inquiry, Carlos was very quick to respond.  Carlos and the team at Towne Forde were very helpful and walked him through the entire transaction! We had a tight budget and they were super helpful and made it happen! I highly recommend Towne Ford and plan to do business with them again, in the future!< /review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Bryan Velasco is an excellent salesman. He is humble, compassionate and down-to-earth. He negotiates reasonably and proves that the client is priority.

Bryan gets to emails, text messages and phone calls promptly. Don't do what I did and bounce around. Find yourself a welcoming and honesst dealership.

Towne Ford of Redwood City is on par with the best the mid peninsula has to offer.</Review>< Pictures>

They do a great job. My truck has run great since they replaced the transmission. Scot was great.  I have dealt with him before and was great again. I'm just afraid of what will happen if that property gets developed. Towne Ford has been and will continue to be my go to place for Ford vehicles and maintenance.< /Text>

I went for an oil change and let them know about any other small issues I was having., Y oil was changed, they let me know about something else they found and asked if I wanted that work done before beginning and my car was washed! Yay! ... I have to take off a star because even though I live in the dealer's service area, their shuttle service doesn't reach my home. I pretty much have to rent a car every time I bring my car in, that's cheaper than Uber. Also, no matter how I inform them in advance, they never get the manager to apply my rewards points to my bill before he leaves for the day. 😠</text>

Edit: After the original review below, we ultimately decided to purchase an Audi E-tron to fill our AWD EV needs. Ford Corporates offered us (and some other Mach E reservation holders) a credit for our troubles, but still has not provide an explanation for the delays or updated timeline for the delivery of the vehicle.

Throughout the 15+ months of my reservation and 2.5 months of delays I was often frustrated by the information I was able to receive from Towne, but I recognize that they were likely struggling to get that data from Ford Corporate themselves. We were prepared to be the guinea pigs, but the repeated quality control concerns and consistently opaque communication around delays and recalls reached a breaking point when compared to the straightforward process of buying an established product line from on-the-lot inventory. Towne is not responsible for Corporate's actions, but hearing that the car is "a week or two away" for ten weeks gets pretty stale.

We genuinely hope that the Mach E is a great platform, but the disappointing rollout is costing the brand its most enthusiastic early adopters and evangelists.

=======================================
I have never tried so hard to give a company a large amount of money and found them so totally uninterested in helping me complete that transaction. I reserved a Mustang Mach E First Edition almost 15 months ago, and while I don't hold the local dealer accountable for the Ford Corporation's manufacturing struggles, Towne has been beyond useless in terms of keeping me updated on the status of the vehicle. These cars are in incredibly high demand, and dealers that fail to convert a reservation are able to mark the vehicle up significantly and still sell it in days or even hours. I can't tell if Towne is actively trying to get me to back out, or if they are just hugely indifferent about all of their $60,000+ transactions.

Over the past five months (since seeing a unit in the showroom and meeting Kevin the Internet Sales rep) I have called dozens of times in search of information on lead times, financing, and other logistics, and I have received a single return call from Kevin. Other staff who are not in Internet Sales positions have been more helpful in terms of fielding my questions and following up. When I have been able to speak directly with Kevin, he told me that "there is a lot of interest around this vehicle, so I check on these orders 2-3 times a week". The information that he is able to give is no different than what I can see using online tools, and I can check it at a single URL in seconds. I don't expect him to care about my particular car as much as I do, but if I had his VIN list (and none of his internal tools) I could check the status of every single Mach E in transit to Towne in a matter of minutes. I've also had to drive the conversation on electric vehicle rebates, on Ford's A/D/X/Z-plan pricing, and on test drives (which I still haven't had).

The vehicle's delivery window has been moved four times. That's not Towne's fault, but they have NEVER reached out to inform me of that. I have been the one driving communication with Towne, and sometimes informing them of the changes rather than the other way around. The lack of information means I have had to keep tens of thousands of dollars earmarked to pay for the vehicle since late December (the original delivery date). The latest delivery window is three days (and counting) past due. The best Towne can tell me is "we see it was due to be here, but it's not".

I don't enjoy giving bad reviews, but I'm very frustrated by the consistently bad communication and the fact that if I do walk away from this sale, Towne will profit even more by selling the car on the open market. I'm not going to buy a $60,000 car out of spite if it's not a good fit, but I do wish that Towne would give the appearance of caring about my customer experience.<//Review>

<text>While the ordering of my car was not done through the dealership, i was required to pick a dealership. Being that I purchased my last two vehicles from Towne Ford and they were the closest to my home, I chose them. I really had very little contact with Towne Ford during the 15 month wait for my new car. About eight months ago I was invited to see a Mach E demo at Towne Ford. At the time I requested to have the interior protection package added to my order (floor and cargo mats). I also  brought the paperwork to get a $100 discount for agreeing to purchase the $600 Sync upgrade. Neither of these requests were acted on. Other than that everything went smoothly.< /text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

Kevin at Towne Ford of Redwood City has been fantastic to work with; super helpful, easy to talk to, and always willing to go the extra mile to ensure you feel confident with your choice. I reserved the Ford Bronco through them because of the value they offer as a whole. I am looking forward to taking ownership of my future Bronco come next year. Thanks again for all the initial support, Kevin!

I'll be sure to post a follow up with pictures on deliver day!</review>

< review>
Here is the situation how much I disappointed with FORD MOTORS and why people do prefer other brands vs US manufacturer. I have a 2014 Ford Focus, purchased in Aug of 2014 from deanship, second owner! Right from the beginning transmission was JUNK, and this issue w bad transmission design well document by MANY and all over.  Over last year or so I received few recalls to replace parts under warranty, and then 2 or 3 weeks ago, in AUGUST of 2020 I receive letter telling me that Ford extending warranty on transmission for 100k or 7 years!!! So  decide its a good time to drop off my car at Towne Ford of Redwood City to do all this recall warranty job and also check transmission. Also just a side note, back in 2016 I did drop off the same car at the same dealership for the same transmission issue!!!, and back then they just updates firmware!! So in AUGUST!!! I stopped by at dealership to check if they can take my car for service and been told only open day is Sep 2 !!! week from that day I stopped by there!!! Maybe if they would check my warranty info when I was there first time, I wouldn't have this issue now. So Today, Sep 3 I got a call from service advisor of this dealership and been told that YES indeed there is a problem w transmission/clutch, BUT my warranty expired last month, August!!! After talking later today w service manager he advice me to call Ford motors and see if they could accommodate and still cover this repair under warranty, because its only few days after it got expired!! I called Ford, spoke w customer service advisor, Bell, and after she put me on hold for few minutes she informed me that unfortunately Ford can't do anything about this situation and can not cover transmission repair under warranty, because car was originally sold in 2013. Keep in mind, I purchased this car summer 2014 and in my estimation it should still be covered under warranty, as of this time and mileage (only 66k). So the question is, WHY SHOULD I EVER AGAIN CONSIDER BUYING AMERICAN CAR, especially Ford?< /review>

<Text>I said from the beginning that I would have to wait for the service.  That was replace the device that raised and lowered the rear window of my truck. F250 extended cab.  I brought it there 15 min. before schedule and it took 3 3/4 hours.  Twice as long as expected.  I didn't feel that they cared about the extended time.  FRUSTRATED. My service rep tried to be supportive but the amount of time was just too much.

If you want to know what you will need to pay upfront and expect honesty, avoid this place. I brought in my car because my clutch was slipping (as it's a known issue for this car) and they told me they "fixed" it without replacing the clutch itself. I have the extended warranty so I paid the $100 deductible. Less than 24 hours later, the clutch slipped again. I called and scheduled another appointment. They said the clutch needed replaced, NO S***. Instead of being upfront about me having to pay an additional $100 for this visit, they did the work and told me they couldn't waive the fee. Now I'm getting the go around where they are telling me to call Ford customer service. If I had known, I would've refused to pay and received the approval first or waited to get it serviced again. Instead, they told me to pay first and try to get it waived. I live in in SF where there are a lot of hills and the clutch slips constantly. This is extremely dangerous...I paid twice for the same problem when it should've been fixed the first time. Unbelievable. I will never buy a Ford again nor will I ever come here for any repairs or issues. If they were honest from the start, this would be a different story.</review>

<text>I drove 45 minutes from the East Bay during rush hour to buy a car from this dealership only for them to tell me I cannot test drive it because I don’t have proof of insurance to drive their vehicle. I’m guessing they don’t have insurance. You’d think they would being that they’re a dealership. And you’d think with such an inconvenience policy the salesman Francisco would’ve said something before I drove from Pleasanton to Redwood City. No heads up. Nothing. Then I get there and the car smells like someone smoked in the vehicle for the past two years with the windows up. Horrible customer service. Also, I am in a rental car because my vehicle was in an accident and was deemed a total loss which is why I don’t have a insurance policy anymore. Weird dealership. I’ve been test driving cars my entire life. Never heard of this one. Came with $17,000 cash in hand ready to buy the car too. Too bad. At least I’ll find a car that doesn’t smell like an ashtray.< /text>< pictures>

I bought my 2020 Ford Edge from salesman Carlos.  Carlos patiently taught me how to drive a keyless car, to use the keyless starter, the back camera and to turn on and off the wind-shield wipers, lights etc.  After I had driven the new car for three days, I made an appointment to have him answer the new questions I encountered during my driving, such as the use of GPS, charging my i-phone, and adjusting the mirrors etc.  Two weeks after my purchase, I realized that I had left my FastPass on the old car I traded in.  I called Carlos again and he was still polite and promised let me know the status of my FastPass as soon as possible.  The over-all experience at Towne was very positive.  They prepared all my documents before my arrival to close the sale.  And when I told Carlos I wanted to add my business to title when I arrive, he went to have all the papers redrawn without telling me.  He did not want me to feel guilty for my own change of mind.  At the end, I did feel guilty because I complained to Carlos that the paper-drawing kept me too long at the dealership that I had to go out for lunch and came back.  Evan then, he did not tell me it was my own change that caused the delay.
This is the third Ford I bought from Towne Ford.  I highly recommend both Carlos and the dealership.</Text>

worst experience ever! Had a water pump replacement done for my 2014 Ford Explorer, two days after, my A/C started failing it would go from hot to cold and it made a hissing noise at times. At first I thought they might have not connected  something, the same day I noticed this problem I called the service advisor Sandy, she asked me to bring in my vehicle so they could take a look. I brought my car in and after 15 min. Sandy and the mechanic who had initially completed the water pump repair said there was nothing wrong with my A/C  this was May 2019. I kept using my A/C occasionally during the summer with the same issues and since ford assured there was nothing wrong I figured there was nothing else I could do. Fortunately I did not need my A/C the rest of the year until the last week when it started to get hot and to my surprise, the A/C did not work AT ALL!. I contacted Julius the service department manager and explained to him my problem, at first he told me it had been almost a year and It was late for ford to do anything about it, he did offer and scheduled a diagnostics test for my vehicle at no cost to find out what the problem was. The day of the diagnostics service I received a call from Paul and was told that I had a leak in the hose and the valve  and it would cost $619.00 Dollars to repair. I explained to Paul that I had issues with my A/C since last year in May after the water pump repair and took it into town ford and was told my vehicle was fine and I needed ford to correct their mistake. He said he would talk to Julius and call me back. I received a call back from Paul telling me that Julius said that was the cost to repair the vehicle. In other words, they are not responsible for fixing their mistakes and I would have to pay if I want my A/C repaired. I am now having to file a complaint a against Towne ford, the form I am filling out asks for a business license number, I called the accounts receivable department and was transferred over to Fatima. When I asked for the number she asked me what my name was and where I was calling from. I gave her my name and explained I needed the number because I was filing a complaint, she was extremely rude and said she would not give me any information. I asked what department she worked in and an employee number so I could report her behavior to her supervisor. She said once more she would not give me any information and hung up on me. I think ford is a good company it’s a shame that they have these type of employees and franchises representing the ford name.</text>

I backed into a tree and broke my taillight on a Thursday, so I got an estimate over email on Friday  and brought my Fiesta in for a fix when the part arrived on Monday. The materials + work were less expensive than a couple other quotes from shops in the area, and it was a no-nonsense, 45 min fix, complete with social distancing and masks worn by employees. They even gave my car a complimentary quick wash.

Note that the body shop is around the corner from the sales and maintenance centers.<//Text>

<date>1574709346746</date><rate>5<//rate><review>Town Ford Sales helped me purchase my new 2019 Ford F-150. I needed a special type of truck for my particular line of work and they were able to get me what I needed. I originally came in to have an issue reviewed on an older truck. Scot the service advisor asked me if I really wanted to spend $2500 - $3500 to fix a 2007 vehicle that’s Blue Book was like $4500. I responded probably not. So the adventure began. He put me in touch with the Fleet Manager named Chip. He reviewed my situation and went out of his way to get me the vehicle I needed. He also referred me to Cory to review my trade ins. I met with him and they were able to give me a fair price on my older trucks. So I traded in two of my vehicles, received rebates on the new truck and got a low APR on my loan with the help of the Town Ford Sales.

My new truck is awesome. Going to work everyday not having to worry about the truck starting, what’s that sound, the cost of gas and working with a vehicle suited more to my job make everyday at work a pleasure instead of a pain. Thank you Town Ford For my New Truck!<//review>< pictures>

I would never recommend this Dealership!!! This Dealership recently sold me a vehicle. I had questions about my newly purchased vehicle and had a buddy who also wanted to buy a vehicle. I left messages for the Sales person who sold me the vehicle. No return call, left a message for the Sales Manager, no return call, left messages for the General Manager & Owner no return call. Apparently,Customer Service and selling another vehicle is not important to them even at the Management & Owner level. What a disappointment and lack of respect for my time as a Consumer.</text>

During a routine oil change a leak was discovered. Luckily I was able to get service on my car the very next day to repair the leak. Even better it was covered by warranty which was going to expire shortly. I was also able to leave my car as I was going out of town and they kept the car for me for one day extra until I could pick it up<//review>

<user_name>Susan Marconda<//user_name><Date>1604280139064< /Date><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>I went to  Towne Ford Auto Body  to get an estimate for repainting my Ranger truck.  At first I just wanted an estimate to repaint the cab area only.  I spoke with Jose, the estimator.  He thoroughly explained what was needed and really broke down the cost.  He answered all my questions too.
While I was waiting for Jose to crunch the numbers I took a look around the shop.

The paint techs were in Covid19  protective gear, were friendly and I noticed how Clean the shop is.  The place was very clean considering the type of work they do there.  The floors were so clean you could practically eat off of them!  Impressive!

Also, I noticed that They work on ALL BRANDS and MODELS- high end cars and daily drivers and everything in between.

Jose came back with my estimate.
The estimate was very detailed and Jose broke down the cost for me.

It was about what I thought it would be.

I then asked Jose what the cost would be to have the entire truck repainted.   Again, Jose crunched the numbers, came back and broke down the cost.  It was higher that I thought but I took into account how honest Jose was, how covid prepared the techs were and the cleanliness of the shop.  I decided to go ahead.
Towne Auto Body Guarantees the paint for the LIFE of the VEHICLE as well. A plus.

We agreed on a day for me to drop off the truck.  I had to rent a car. While the truck was being worked on.
Towne Auto Body has a Rental car discount for customers who are having major work done on their vehicles at Towne Auto Body.  A very pleasant surprise to me.

Jose said they needed my truck for 13, yes, 13 days.  I wasnt happy about that but Jose explained that they’d be taking numerous parts off the truck to paint and then replace said parts after painting on the truck.  Very labor intense process.

Towne Auto Body  arranged a  rental discount for me with Hertz rent a car.

Because of the discount offered to me by Towne Auto Body I saved about$100.00 OFF the cost of the rental car for the 13 days I had it.

I excitedly went to pick up my truck when it was ready.  The truck looked Fantastic!  Shining and gleaming with its fresh paint!  I took it home.

Less than a week later I noticed paint missing from the inside door edges.  It was fresh.  There was no paint missing from those areas when I dropped off the truck.  I brought the truck back to Town Auto Body.

Jose took a look at it and realized what caused it.  The techs had taped those  areas To prevent overspray and paint runs.  When they removed the tape some paint went with the tape.

Ok, it happens.

I told Jose I wasnt happy that I had to come back to the shop.
I explained that it would be hard for me to take time off to drop off/ pick up the truck due to my work  and that I’d need to pay for a rental car, again.  I was disappointed as I had just  spent A LOT of hard earned money to have the job done but minor  errors occurred that werent caught.

Jose went above and beyond to make it right for me.

He discussed the issue with his manager, Frank, who approved a car rental for me at NO COST to me.

And, I was originally told they’d need my truck for another 2 days to redo the inside door edges.
but when I went to drop off the truck, they told me I would have my truck back that SAME day!  😳   I was floored!

Towne Auto Body paid for my car rental for that day, too.
Ok.  An error happened with the truck and they  agreed to fix it.   I did NOT  expect for the SHOP TO PAY for the rental car.  They did.  😳

Later that  same day I went back to Towne Auto Body to pick up my truck.  It looked Better than I hoped!

Jose, Frank and all the tech guys at Towne Auto Body take care of their customers.

They make you feel welcome and are professional yet friendly.

They EXCEEDED  my expectations! I am a Very Satisfied customer.

I Highly Recommend Towne Auto Body for all your auto body needs.  They take Excellent care of your vehicle and their customers!

Thanks Guys!< /Text>< pictures>

After talking to 3 people at Ford. PAUL was the BEST of the BEST! He provided the BEST SERVICE ever from beginning to end, smoothly and professionally.
He made feel as a valuable customer and went beyond of what I was asking.

THANK YOU PAUL FOR MAKING MY LIFE A LOT EASIER AT THIS CHALLENGING TIMES.

Best dealership in the Bay Area as far as customer service and making things right.
If I still have a Ford it's because of the people who work at this dealership. This company surely has good leadership and knows good customer service.
Service manager knows how to handle customers and make sure they are satisfied. Great Job  Julius and Paul.
Thank you for taking care of me.</Review>

<review>Very disappointed with my customer service I have recieved from this dealership. I was very interested in a car and was planning on flying out to purchase it. I was having everything set up to do so and the guy I was talking to totally ghosted me. I sent them multiple emails trying to ask when I could come down and they would not email me back. After 2 days of hearing nothing back I finally called the dealership and they told me it was sold a day ago. Right after that they sent me an email telling me it was sold. Very shady people here, don’t buy a car here.<//review>< Pictures>

<text>Brought my F250 in for regular maintenance service.  The fuel filter was changed.  The "low fuel pressure" warning light came on upon leaving Towne Ford.  Returned to Towne Ford.  A Service Advisor was able to turn off warning light without any further check-up.  Drove onto freeway and "Low fuel pressure" light returned, along with "reduced engine power" lights warning.  Returned to Towne Ford again.  They stated it was a loose oil filter that caused the warning lights.  I drove it home to San Mateo without any further problems.  Also, you must be willing to wait patiently for your vehicle.  I waited four-hours and another two hours for the secondary repair.  However, aside from these two issues, staff employees were friendly and maintained regular contacts during my wait.  The waiting room has very limited amenities.  I will return a second time to determine if my first visit issue was an abberation<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><GmapID>0x808fa3af2ada5b43:0x1dd8cce738cc0a5d</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Name>Brian Keller<//Name><text>I've bought more than a handful of cars over the years at Towne.

Had a 2015 Explorer, it was getting a bit high in miles. Didn't have much of a down payment. Managed a trade-in and only increased my monthly payments by $200. Driving a new car, extra low miles. It was a great deal!< /text>< response>

Alex was great! He was patient, explained everything in detail, made sure that I knew all of my options AND helped me make the best car option for me and my family. He was very supportive all the way and didn't force a specific car on me. I have bought two cars before at other dealerships and I will have to say that this is the best experience I have had. It means a lot to me that there is a car dealership like Towne Ford and salesmen like Alex that value INTEGRITY and HONESTY. 5 STARS!!!!<//Text>

<Review>These people took 6 months to take care of the license plate and registration for the car I bought from them. I went to their office countless times to complain and everyone seemed indifferent about it.

One time Bass(the account manager) told me that the documents would be ready when I dropped by the following day in the afternoon. I get to their office and he wasn't even there. I waited for 30 minutes for him to arrive, and when he did he told me he still didn't have them and it would take more time.

Another instance, he told me to line up at the DMV. I lined up for 2 hours only to be told that the car wasn't even registered to me yet! This was 4 months after I purchased the car.

I contacted them numerous times after this happened and they were always either hard to reach or had excuses about how it would take more time to acquire the documents. This is very unreasonable as I paid the $95 documentation fee when I purchased my car. This whole thing went on for 2 months of me complaining, and had to drive a few days with an expired temporary license plate before they gave me another temporary permit.

They did not reimburse me in some form or manner for all the time and effort I put in just to get my damn license plate and registration which should have arrived less than a month after I purchased my car.

Avoid at all costs, they do not care about customer service. I gave them so many chances to make this right.<//Review>< rating>

< review>
I bought my Ford car from Serramonte Ford and therefore initially brought it there to get a rattling noise fixed, but it came back in the same condition with no road-to-improvement at all. They even banged up my interior panels while "trying to fix" the problem. But at Towne Ford, Alex Gen had a totally different approach which actually helped to reduce the rattling noise! We're still working on it, but I have MUCH more confidence in Towne Ford over Serramonte. I live in San Francisco and actually don't mind the 30 mins drive to Towne Ford if it actually helps my concern. Proud of the team there. COVID-Related, everyone is socially distant, protected with masks/face coverings. Sanitzers are apparent and available for use.</review>

We hope to see you soon and have a great weekend!'}<//response>< gmapID>

This place is total scam. I brought my truck for oil change and in meanwhile asked what is the cost of replacing broken door handle. So within two days that did not manage to change oil even though I had an appointment. However, they charged me $220 for telling me that the door handle is broken and they wanted $200 more to replace it. Note that cost of the part is $40 and requires about 30 minutes to replace it.

PS. These morons sell personal information. Today I received a promotion letter from Sirius  XM.<//Text>

I made a appointment to come in at a particular time to make the deal.  They had all day to prep the car.  Car was filthy on my arrival.  There are water stains on exterior that I have tried to have professionally buffed out  but to no avail.  Since now properly cleaning it, there are also scratches on the windows.  I am going to have to find someone to buff them out now if its even possible. Devils in the details.  They are more concerned about the deal than the details.< /Review>< resp>

Went to get a light fixed and hopefully my visor. I was able to get my light replaced. Only thing is service could have been faster since i had an appointment. I dropped my car off at 10:30 my car wasn't finished until 4pm. i wouldn't have cared so much if they were able to fix my visor but that wasn't the case. They quoted me $150 for a light and I walked out paying a little cheaper which was a nice surprise.</Review>

Brought in my 2018 F150 for a sunroof issue and transmission issue. They’re service was great. In the process I noticed that my truck might have been hit on the front passenger window causing it to crack. I couldn’t prove 100% that is was them. Went in to talk the the advisor, Scot and prepped myself to have to put up a fight. The conversation with Scot and the manager, Julius, took 10 minutes. They said they couldn’t prove it wasn’t them so they replaced my window and reimbursed me to re-tint my window. Painless. Thanks Towne Ford.<//Text>

I’ve been servicing my SUV at Towne Ford for the past 11 years.  I would highly recommend them to anyone who needs interval maintenance or repairs on their car.  Easy to make an appointment by phone or online.  Comfortable waiting area with WFi if needed or convenient shuttle service if you’d rather not wait.  Just great customer service all around.  Give Towne Ford an opportunity to service your vehicle and you’ll see why they gained my trust and loyalty over a decade ago.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><text>They are the most incompetent dealership in the Bay Area.  If you are thinking about buying a car or truck from them do not bother. Try calling their service department to try to make an appointment for something as simple as a tuneup on your Ford. My bet is you will have to make at least 5 call and will spend at least 30 minutes on hold and you still will not get an appointment. As I had no luck wasting over an hour this morning. I will never buy a Ford again.<//text>< pics>

service was great and quick.  However as I was leaving, I noticed a growling in my front left wheelwell.  Turns out there was some shredded pieces hanging from wheelwell which was rubbing against the tires.  I've since made a separate appointment to get this part replaced, but I wish someone would have pointed this out in the first place.  Can't believe the technicians didn't notice it when they rotated the tires.  Otherwise, service for oil change was great<//Text>

Good news:  Took my vehicle in for service and it was repaired before the estimated due date.

Bad news:  I called the service number three times, left message on voicemail twice, no one returned my call and on the third call, I spoke to someone who transferred me to voicemail.  I finally just showed up in person to make an appointment and everything went well from there.< /review>

I have had my car serviced, as well as had body repairs performed at Towne Ford, for over seven years. Scot works to be sure problems have been correctly diagnosed and has completely handled all warrant claims for me. My most recent experience at Towne Ford was with the body shop. Jose worked with my insurance company on two separate claims, both of which had additional damage the appraiser didn’t catch, and did a great job.</Text>

<Review>I just recently bought a 2014 ford edge, the sticker price was $13,999.
I gave a $5000 down payment. which left me with a $208 monthly payment over 60 months.
During the final stages of the purchase, I was offered several kinds of warranties,  at first I declined all the offers, but the sales person kept offering different deals......
I felt pressured by his continuous bombardment of options for the warranty.
It wasn't until i got home and did the calculations that I realized i had been pressured into something I really didn't want or need .
The sales person pressured me into purchasing a warranty that covers the engine , transmission  for 36 mos/ 36000 miles.
I now have 72 payments(instead of the original 60) of $214  with a total purchase price of $20,468(originally @13,999).
after my $5,000 down payment, I have a financed price of$13,059.
If I could start again,. I would decline all warranties.
Not happy how this turned out.....< /Review></record>

The service department is fantastic.  The oil change and tire rotation is extremely reasonable.  Watch out for those places that claim to charge you less.  They charge extra for semi synthetic oil, premium oil filter and a tire rotation.  At Towne Ford Sales it is all included in the price of your visit and much more reasonable, less expensive and more quality oil, parts and service.</Text>

Alex was very helpful and they took the time to service my car without hurrying. I have been to almost all the Ford service center in the bay area and frankly they do not compare to the quality service I received at Towne Ford.< /review>

<Text>I was happy with the repair that Towne Ford did on my vehicle.  I was not, however, happy with the door dent that occurred sometime while my vehicle was in possession of Towne Ford.  I brought this to the attention of Jay and he told me he would check on this with his supervisor.  That was on Friday,  August 9th.

Had to wait about 15 minutes to be checked in yesterday, while several cubicles were occupied by service technicians seemingly studying their computers.  No acknowledgement of my arrival.  When I picked up my car, the receptionist didn't go over what was serviced or found, or offer to call a technician to explain things. After I picked up my car, I got an email that I had missed my appointment.  When I called to inquire why I got such an email, the person on the phone had no idea how to handle my inquiry.  While she fumbled around for some sort of answer, I just hung up because it looked like a further waste of my time.
And oh, I guess the service itself was satisfactory.< /review>

Quick service, my service guy was professional and very welcoming. However the lady that sits in front of the customer lobby waiting area was not welcoming actually she was nonchalant and dismissive when ask a question. Everyone else was warm and friendly, if she is the representative of your company as customer's enter, "image is everything " I  can see where this would have a very negative narrative on your "Go Further slogan" that's used.< /text>

Other dealerships on the SF Peninsula might have massive fancy waiting areas but Towne Ford has what counts - Excellent Customer Service. Everyone is friendly and professional. I am used to waiting up to 4hrs even with an appointment at other dealerships, Towne Ford quoted me "up to 40 minutes" and had me out of there in 20 with my appointment. When the price is exactly the same as other dealerships but the service is way better, I'm voting with my wallet and coming to Towne Ford.

Services received:
Out-of-warranty battery replacement on my Edge Sport.</review>

Fantastic Buying Experience!  I had been searching for a lightly used C-Max and found exactly what I was looking for here for a great deal.  During a busy day with my family at the zoo, David and his staff worked hard to allow me to enjoy the day with my kids while they took care of financing, pricing and rapid, courteous communication using minimal time on my phone to keep the experience family-focused.  When everything was taken care of, I could drive over and saw the car had been fully detailed with no surprises.  David was very knowledgeable about all of the aspects of a plug-in hybrid (of which I was a rookie!) and completely made the sale.  Thank you!!<//Text>

Good service, efficient with time frame of service, courteous faces and I feel good that the services that I received on my getting older truck will be brought to safety and continuous future rides home to work and back. I really appreciate the concerns that are found during servicing and letting me know no rush, but make an appointment soon. My truck is safe for now, comforting and assurance.
Towne Ford is a 5 stars rating. always greeted with a smile and welcoming by staff.<//Review>

I would give Paul a 10 out of 1o for his great service. We have had Paul since we purchased our Explorer and I would like to continue to have him as a Service advisor.
Thank you Paul for your great customer service-thumbs up!!!

I went in to check out a car today and had a great experience. Kyle Schwab is the salesperson I dealt with. He was very courteous, knowledgeable about the car and professional. I didn't end up buying the car, but he was very upfront and didn't drag the process out (none of that "let me talk to my manager" tactics). Kudos for valuing my (and his) time.</Text>

<review>Its been 4 months I bought a car from them. Wasn't taken seriously as a  customer at my first visit, they thought I was just there to get prices. I don't know if thats a sell strategy. Also, I am supposed to get a refund for warranty change. Have called more than 10 times but nothing got done yet. Very disappointed. Not going to recommend to anyone.< /review></record>

If you need a car or truck, ask for KEVIN… He is NOTHING like your average dealership salesman. My understanding is Kevin has worked for Town Ford for several years, and I can clearly see why.

I should start by saying that I know that I am a difficult customer, and am likely more savvy than your average car buyer regarding pricing, etc (I am in the auto industry). Kevin was able to put up with all of my crap while maintaining a cool calm and collected attitude the entire time, which resulted in him selling me a brand spanking new fully loaded truck.

Kevin gets a major win for a couple reasons: his communication with me was very fast and effective, and he communicated through my preferred medium which is email. Most importantly, Kevin did not restrict my purchasing choices to what he had on the lot. Kevin was willing to look through the entire Ford system and find the exact truck with the exact options that I was looking for. It did not matter that his dealership did not have it on their floor, as Kevin was interested in finding a truck that actually met my needs.

I would also like to point out that the normal car dealership games did not exist. He did not even try to pull any tricks on me, and there was no mention of the old “what can I do to put you in this car today” line. Personally, if I hear a car dealer say something like that to me, it is indicative that I am at a place where I will not be doing business.

Long story short is if you’re looking for a good and honest ford dealer, hit up Kevin at Town Ford. You won’t be led down the wrong path.< /text>

I got excellent service for my Ford Explorer on June 4, 2019.  At first, I have to come in an hour earlier due to dental emergency that I have to go that same day. The Service Coordinator accommodated me, complete with an Uber service to shuttle me home.
This is what I call excellent service! Way to go guys!!</Text>

The repair seems fine, I've not driven extensively yet but haven't noticed the chugging anymore.  However, the car came back with huge red blotchy stains all over the roof and hood which weren't there when I left it.  For a tab that was nearly 1.4K, it would have been nice to get a car back that wasn't dirtier than when I left it.  Thanks.  I got some of the stains out myself, but some are still there.<//Text>

<Text>Towne Ford has upped there game.

First off, Suzanne Zappulla is a real pro. She had my van being worked on within minutes of my arrival.

Bass Butler the "finance manager" came to my rescue on a problem: thank you Bass!

However, the general sales manager reached out to better understand what happened. I sincerely appreciated his attempts to rectify the situation. I needed another part installed on my car and he directly coordinated the install so everything went smoothly. The service folks have it together and were courteous, professional, and got the job done quickly. Definitely a much improved experience and would go back for the good service experience.<//text></record>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>Poor communication,
I’ve never called anyone a liar but here I got so many untruthful elements.
Promises made but not delivered upon.
Price changes unauthorized.
Poor communication between sales person and finance manager that would have cost me thousands if I didn’t catch.
Makes one wonder if they plan on such things. Most honorable people don’t make so many mistakes.
Promised to call back many times and no one calls you. I had to drive to the dealer from Burlingame to Redwood City ( Not a great distance but takes Time ) to get questions answered. They don’t answer the phone, they don’t respond to emails.
I have never had such a horrible experience as this.
This is the first time I’ve ever written an I complementary survey and it pained me to do this but the frustration I went through no one deserves.<//text>< pictures>

Towne ford is the epitome of a thieving car dealership.

Towne Ford is charging me hundreds of dollars to make my car safe for me and my family. They booked my appointment for the recall service two weeks PAST when it would be covered and is now costing us hundreds. Two weeks prior the service would have been completely covered. This service has to be done to make my car safe as it allows carbon monoxide to enter into the cab of the vehicle. Towne Ford is trying to kill me and my family and is holding hundreds of dollars over our head to get the service done. The letter from ford says it will all be done for free.

Avoid this place at all cost if you value your time, money and your life. They will rob you of it all.

Absolutely will never recommend or buy another ford vehicle especially at Towne ford

UPDATE:
Ford has extended the recall of the exhaust system and now TOWNE FORD OF REDWOOD CITY;

1: refuses to give me my money back even though the recall paperwork from ford says this is done free of charge.

2: ignores multiple voicemails and any attempt to contact

3: has said repeatedly they will call me back  and never do.

I am actually astonished this is allowed to happen. The incompetence of this dealership knows no bounds. This has to be illegal, Towne ford has hundreds of my dollars and refuses to refund the free recall!!!< /Review>

I was very satisfied with the customer service and the recall repair but terribly disappointed when I got home and saw that the hood of the car was not securely closed. Fortunately, I drove home on local streets and did not have to go on the freeway where who knows what would have happened to the hood at high speed.</review>

I brought my explorer for driver side 3rd row seat problem. They changed a part costs $2000 but changing part didnt work. They asked a master and he said to change another part and it costs $400 more. Did they change the first part unnecessarily? It is meaningless. I have to believe what they said.  It took 1 week. When I went to get the car , this time passenger side seat didn't fold. OMG. I will go again today.</review>

Towne Ford is doing great job. They are fast and good asisstant. They help you to find true car for you. And special thanks for Mr.David.Y.Senyurt. He helped a lot and he looked like that he would buy a car herself. He answered my every question far better. He spared his time and he gave me to time a lot to think. I wanted to take my key in the end of the day for this he did overtime. I think that it's a start. You know we all the time need a better car, right : ) To find reliable person is really hard. But Mr.Senyurt made my decision easier. Thank him again from here. Thanks for Towne Ford..</Review>

<review>I had a new lease car with recall notice and a starting problem that made the car unreliable.  The service dept. was booked and said come back in 3 weeks and refused to offer a free rental.  Sorry Ford, I expect much better service.   The body shop also fixed my car and handed it back to me still broken and apparently did not even test drive it before handing me the keys.  Very disappointing service through out and nothing but lame excuses and no leadership.<//review>< Pics>

Towne Ford Service Department consistently could not find out why the 12 volt accessories battery (not the one for the motor) on my 2015 electric Ford Focus kept being discharged so that it would not start.

I would have it towed in (Ford towing service is great by the way) and they would keep it for days every time.

The first time they it was a electric harness problem.  They replaced it and it worked for a while.

The second time it was a battery.  They replaced it and it worked for a while.

The third time, they said it was a software problem.  They corrected it and it worked for a while.  (Towne used the extended warranty I had bought when I purchased the car because they said software issues were not covered by original warranty).

The fourth time, they couldn’t find anything wrong, but it would start so they returned it to me.   That’s when I bought another electric car from another company.  Luckily all four times the car stopped working, I was either at home or near it.  I didn’t want to take a chance on a fifth time that the car doesn’t work when my wife or I are on freeway and we’re stranded.

I will never buy a Ford again because I think their cars are bad, and their service departments are terrible.  (I also brought my Focus to Serramonte Ford in Daly City and Veracom Ford in Burlingame for recalls & maintenance and they were worse than Towne..). Also, all 3 dealerships refused to give me a
loaner car while my car was in their shops even though I had the extended warranty.  It took all of them days to even look at the car because they don’t have  electric vehicle techs.

I have Toyotas and Mazda’s and their Service although expensive, have always been good.
Hope it’s not an American car company problem as I replaced the Focus with Chevy Bolt.<//text>

<text>Big layers, car on the picture is perfect but when you come to see its 100% different car in the bad condition that bad you don't even stick your foot in . Rude sales people when you ask him why you don't fix car they let me now you can dolt yourself this is used car not brand new. If you don't like something buy new, they don't even think we come to buy Chevy and they offer Ford with different on the price for $30.000 wars place never ever come again. They not respect customer who they planning to sell car. Stay away from this place its lots good places who will work with you.< /text>< Pics>

<rate>2</rate><review>I did not have a good experience here. I brought my new F450 for a defective LED headlamp. They were able to verify it was defective and subsequently replaced the headlamp assembly. That whole process was okay.

Driving home I noticed the headlamps appeared uneven. When I looked at the front I then noticed the headlamp seal (at the bottom of the headlamp) was pinched under the headlamp. I called and asked if this was their idea of quality workmanship. They toldu me to bring it back in (can you say inconvenience). Over the weekend I found out the headlamp was totally out of adjustment. At that point I was seriously irritated. Well after the next trip it was fixed.

I would not recommend this place for service. While they eventually got it fixed, you need to keep a careful eye on their workmanship. I would think quality would be a priority on an $80k + truck.<//review>< pictures>

Had some sunroof warranty work on my Edge. Took it into the Towne Ford body shop. Frank did the precheck and got approval from Ford. I dropped the car off and it was done in the afternoon as promised. Great service.</Text>

<review>I purchased a 2019 Ford Fusion Energi from Towne Ford. From the time I ordered the car until I picked it up, the salesman, Peter Verducci, was informative and updated me through the whole process. When my wife and I went to pick it up, he spent a long time in the car explaining all the features. We really enjoyed working with Peter and Towne Ford.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Kind of surprised at all the bad reviews here considering how I had a super smooth car buying experience. I was in an out in a new Focus ST in 3 hours including financing. That was by far the quickest car purchase I've ever made.

Amanda was great and was able to work a deal lower than the employee discount I get through my employer. I did have to negotiate a bit on my trade in, but if you don't enjoy the negotiation process, you may want to find a friend who does and take them with you.< /Text>

I likeTowne Ford.  There is a strong effort for customer satisfaction.  It sometimes feel like more effort is put towards getting good reviews rather than providing service.  We had a recent oil change and asked that they address the "check engine" light. They changed the oil but did not comment on the light.< /text>

<Review>I took my 2012 ford fiesta in for repairs for a minor fender bender damage a few weeks ago. I spoke with Frank at the autobody shop who first gave me a quick look at my car after my accident. He suggested a few things after taking a look at the damage and after wards I filed my claim with my insurance agent.

Frank was very professional and up front right away about the damages and the estimated time for repairs. I really appreciate his friendly attitude and willingness to help me understand the process. When additional supplement damage was found, Frank was very timely and told me as soon as his team found the additional damage, so that the repair process could be quickly continued.

I honestly wish my last time around I had these guys around to fix my car, since my car is Ford make, I trust Ford more than anyone else to do the job right, and Frank said so right from the start. His team does things the right way, not with a half effort like many other places I could have taken my car to for the repairs. Thanks Frank  and your team at Ford Autobody on El Camino Real for the excellent and speedy repairs on my car!

-Chris

Update: I took my car in for some repairs last week and was really impressed with the overall attention to care with my car. Scot was my advisor and he provided clear updates along the way along with what the technicians needed to do for the repairs and the estimated time remaining to do them.

The team here always does such an excellent job and I honestly don't trust any other repair shop with my car than Ford. Thanks for the great service and keeping me in the loop during the repairs!<//Review>< Pictures>

<resp>None</resp><review>My alternator died so my insurance company had my car towed here. I have three complaints. (1) They are an official Ford dealership so they charge $200/hour for labor, or twice the usual rate. (2) My car is a 2001 that's on its last legs, and they wanted to put in a brand new alternator. I had to negotiate for a refurbished one. (3) Last but not least, after I left the lot, and pulled onto the 101, my car started making grinding noises, which it had never done before. I took it to another shop where they diagnosed it as a broken motor mount. So... I overpaid for an alternator fix and left with a broken motor mount. Bad deal. Would not go back.<//review><Time>1521815287282< /Time>< rate>

Brand new car needs a new glove box and the lift gate is askew. Made an appointment to have it looked at only to tell me that they didn't get to it and to make another appointment, which I did.  At 6pm that next appointment  ( I had to call ), told me that they would order the part and have a rental car.  Great!  6 weeks later I have heard zero, zip, zilch.  Guess because my car is under warranty and it isn't a paid repair,  they figure maybe I'll just fall off the radar.  Also why bother having appointments if you can't honor them?  Thanks for the outstanding service Victor.<//Review>

The customer experience was exceptional, and the service team was wonderful. If you're looking for a new or used car, give this dealership a try first! Their honest, no hassels, straight forward approach to car sales is refreshing, and was a positive experience for me right down to the loan financing & close. I got the best rate possible based on my credit worthiness, & there was zero upsale. Warranties and maintenance packages were available & offered, but not using pressure tactics. It's a very small scale family owned operation, & I highly recommend this dealership if you are interested in changing up those wheels 😃!  Even if they don't have your car on the lot, they probably can still help you find the perfect vehicle. Give it a try!< /Text>< Time>

<Text>Impossible to get a hold of.  I have called their service department several times over the last few weeks to try to get some information on some service that needs to be performed on my F150, including several questions about parts and cost.  Every time I call I am sent to the voice mailbox for a "service specialist" and then never hear from them again.  I have had to call back in an attempt to track down this wayward soul literally a dozen times.  I have never once spoken to this illusive specialist.

Getting service done at a dealership sucks, but I would at least expect it to be handled professionally.  You know, like a business.  No dice at Towne Ford.< /Text>< gmapID>

Bought my Mustang at another dealer a few years back. Right after the purchase I got a CEL (check engine light) when I called the dealer I purchased from the weren't willing to commit to whether or not they could even look at it that day. So I called Towne and they took care of everything, I have kept coming back for 10 years never a bad experience. Scot is the best!<//Text>

< Review>
I’ve been having trouble with my seat on F-150 for over a year.  now my wife drives it. I found out my
Warranty ran out mid last year and didn’t get it taken care of in time so I brought it in to figure out what was going on with it And was told it would be 1700 dollars to fix and on top of that I was charged $200 just to tell me what was wrong so no I’m not very happy with ford and I think I’m gonna be taking my business elsewhere $1700 is just a little bit too steep to fix the seat to go up-and-down back-and-forth<//Review>

<Review>I have gone here religiously, every 10K, since buying my Escape Hybrid in 2008.  I'm sad to say they have become less responsive to their customers, with longer appointment lead times, and even more expensive.  They are charging me $200 just to look at the error log that the car's computer will spit out in milliseconds.  Even if they needed to manually look up the error codes, it wouldn't take an hour.  Too bad.  While I like to be loyal and have the work records all in one place, it is time to find somebody else.<//Review>< Pics>

I've leased two vehicles here, and this dealership goes out of its way to treat people well. I walk in as a single woman, and am treated with respect and courtesy. Jorge, my sales associate, was on his hands & knees cleaning junk out of my old car when I turned it in. These people will go the extra mile for you every time.<//review>

<date>1486504121486< /date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>I believe there is a severe lack of accountability from the top down at Towne Ford.
SALES: My first encounter "trying" to buy a van 2014, was so frustrating.  I went into the showroom to order a Transit Connect.  The sales person said "those are hard to get".  A month after that visit, "I called back" a few times to see if there was any progress in getting a van, with no help from the sales person.

I called another dealership, ordered the van, and received it in two days
equipped the way I wanted it.

SERVICE: I live in Redwood City and like to use local business. I started getting regular service at Towne Ford with my new van purchased elsewhere. All was going well until I had a problem: the battery would not hold a charge. The service advisor  asked me make an appointment and to come back in two days.  I explained that I had to have three "jumps during the day just to work."  Reluctantly, he agreed to have a service tech take a look at the van that day.
The first thing out of the mouth of the service person was, "Where did you buy this van?"  "You didn't buy it here!"  They did their test on the battery and concluded that it was fine, and I should just drive it home.  I asked them to keep it overnight and check in the morning to be sure of the findings.  Long story short, it was a bad battery.  It was replaced under warranty.  During this time, the service person and the tech, began speaking in Spanish in front of me. As a Spanish-speaking person myself, the gist of their conversation was that I was a "pain in the ass."
I went back for another oil/tire service and wanted to get new wiper blades at the same time, and all was good.  The rain started the next day, I turned the wipers on and started laughing.  The new blades were about half the size of the correct ones.
I called the service department to let them know, and bring it back for the correct size.  The service person asked my "how do I know that they're the wrong size?"  "They are way too small and only clean 60% of the windshield."   The service person said that I'd "have to bring in all of the paperwork from my last service."   My question was: "don't you have that in your records?"  He wanted to see "my" paperwork. OK.
I arrived, stood around for 15 minutes.  The service person asked the tech to replace the wiper blades and that started the next dance. The tech wanted to know how he was going to find the correct size.  I measured the blades on a van that Towne had in stock on site--30" not the 17.5" that was installed on my van.  The tech and service person went to the booth to talk while I sat in the my van outside of the booth.
5 minutes passed.  I asked "do I need to sign any paperwork?"
Answer:  No, you can go.
Customer Conclusion: Why should I go back to Towne Ford, when in fact, I wrote a letter to your Customer Service Manager, and got NO reply.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

<text>Worst customer service ever! I visited this dealership with my family with the intention of buying a Focus RS. Basically, John the salesperson told us that our business was not welcomed. Prior to my arrival, I had spoken to John over the phone; he did not know & could not help me find out their hours of operation. As salesman at Ford, he also didn’t know the difference between a Ford Mustang and a Ford GT40. The dealership is great, they are just hiring the wrong people.</text>< Name>

<Review>My sales rep was great, but the manager was an a-hole who wouldn't work with me at all. I was in the middle of buying a car when I had to leave to go to work. The manager said if I waited until the next day to buy, he would charge me a few hundred more dollars (because I'm sure he needed to sell some quota). I ended up finishing the transaction that day to save the money and being very late to work. I'm ashamed I didn't take my business elsewhere.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Text>Thank you for finally agreeing to take my car that was leaking transmission fluid and not making me wait until the first appointment which was 2 days later .   Curious that the leak was from a dipstick not properly inserted since the last people under my hood were  FORD in September when I brought the car in for an oil/fluid Works.   Very curious, but they said there was no further leak.   Fingers crossed.

<Text>I had the worst experience buying a car...not once but twice.. Not only do they fleece you with quotes that are double in the ford website but they also take about 1 hr to work on the quote and make the customer wait..the best was when the guy in the deal making counter who said '_the longer you wait the better your deal'...can't believe he said that...while ford has good cars, this dealership is inefficient and doesn't care about customers...I would recommend going to Sunnyvale or Daly city and avoid this dealership< /Text><pics>None</pics>< rating>

2 month nightmare. This company has caused so much stress!
We drove three hours for a vehicle, they had nothing prepared it took several hours to process. Vehicle had malfuctions during test drive. Some of which I planned on it being used.
We purchase then leave. Weeks later Bass calls me saying they messed up on paperwork. He sends us all documents to sign. We sign, return paperwork with the envelope provided by dealership. They claim to never recieve it. Weeks pass. I get calls constantly about the papaerwork we already sent. They cant find it, we are freaking out because basically our identities are in that envelope. They send us nasty letters and phone calls claiming to reclaim the vehicle and wants us to drive it back 3hrs away because they havent recieved their paperwork that they originally messed up on. Another week passes, I recieve no call.
I call Bass to ask if they recieved it. He repsonds yes, we got it. Great! I request copies and a location to pay my car payment because its due very soon. Crickets
I had to log into a credit Bureau and find what companies recently ran my credit. Called them, they had my info and made the payment.
Im in sales aswell, ive never delt with a company or organization so ill prepared.
I was looking to develop a lasting relationship with a company outside my territory. This certainly is not it.< /text>

I scheduled an appointment to drop my car off. I dropped the car off the night before when they were still open. Usually they give you a slip and confirm what the service you wan but they didn't even do that. I called the next morning at 9:30 and got their vmail and asked for someone to call me back with status. I got no call back. I called at 4:30 and was told that my service advisor was ill and so they didn't know what was happening with my vehicle. Incredibly disappointed with this service.</review>

there is no option for less than 1 star.. unfortunately!  This place never answers their phones and when you leave a VM you never get a call back.  I even called the Service Manager who said that someone would call me back right away, here I am a week later on hold.  This is the only ford service in Redwood City and they put a new meaning on SUCK!

After sitting on hold for nearly 30 minutes, I was routed to another person and got only VM... don't expect a call back so I'll find another dealer who can be more respectful of my time!!!!< /Text>

We could not be happier with Towne Ford. From sales to service they know how to treat their customers. We currently have 3 vehicles serviced there and would not consider going anywhere else...you won't be disappointed!< /Text>

I give one star because is the minimum and can't give something lower. I bought a cargo van last year. At the time I got in Towne ford Ramzi got to me and was pushing to buy something that I didn't wanted to. At the end I bought it but I had the problem as other persons reviews because it was a problem to get all my paperwork plus they got the address wrong so it took about 6 months to get my license plates. Now it is time for service and I've heard from one of my clients that they were really bad in the past doing interval service. I'm about nervous about this.<//Text>

Always listens to complaint and trys to get back to you asap.  Caltrain is close by ( gotta walk bout 5/6 blocks).  Lots of stuff around to kill time.  Super friendly people and helpful.

<review>Bought a truck from this dealership the first week of June 2016 I just now almost the end of January 2017 and I still don't have all the paperwork to get the tags on my truck. I don't know if this dalership still uses the pny Express but I prefer te modern mail system it's much quicker. Like LeBron carving up the warriors defense.

<Date>1419880263282< /Date><rate>2< /rate><Review>I would not recommend this dealership unless you are fully prepared and alert to deceptive sales strategies. I got a car I wanted, at a price I was has happy with, but I had done my homework and knew most of what was going on.

It started with an attempt at bait and switch. The Ford Focus was listed on CarGurus for $4999. A little too much based on m research, even with good mileage, and the online picture showed a visible dent. Surprise!When I get there the sticker price is $7999. So If I hadn't done my homework, I would have been bargaining from a price $3000 higher!
The car was already running.to mask a shimmy, he wanted to drive on the highway because the brakes squeal. Promised to fill up the nearly empty gas tank.
Now he gives me the CarFax--"It says there was an accident, but most people don't think that's important.--Look, it's got brand new tires!" (It's called a redirect)
I go around the car--yes, there it is, a definite dent. "Look at the hood, it's a bit out of alignment--oh the front screen come right out, and the strut that connects the headlight assembly to the frame is completely broken." I make to leave, he tries to get me to stay by suggesting that another buyer is going to snatch the car away"--I say that another buyer is going to see the same damage I see.
Fact is, I really like the car, but not at that price. He says make an offer, I lowball it. He counters, I counter again, within my predetermined range, with the condition that the brakes be checked. We start the paperwork, fine and dandy, he keeps disappearing, then comes back with, "The boss says they won't check the brakes". So he takes $300 off the price and it's now only $100 higher than my lowball offer." I also pay $75 for the right to return the car in 2 days, because I'm definitely having
my mechanic check it out. Oh, and they won't buy me any gas, either. . .Bottom line--the car is OK, needs some work, I would have returned it at the higher offer. I'm fine because  I knew what I was looking for and what the fair prices were. But definitely beware of this dealership! They made a sale, but they didn't gain a customer.<//Review>< Pics>

Sales associates aren't well informed. Sales managers hide information to misinform the customer. If you have a problem after the fact, very little help or support available. I had a missing armrest tray and they wouldn't replace it, despite it being missing on a new, warrantied car, from the dealership.< /text>

This winery is awesome! It has limited seating inside which could be unfortunate. However, the bartender we had was really knowledgeable and had a fun personality. They also have such a wide range of wines, red, rose and white. In addition, to a span of sweet, dry and in between. They also have some unique wines, such as one I had, had some spice to it due to peppers being used in the process. It is a fun atmosphere, would highly recommend :)< /text>

<Review>Wandering around I was craving WINE and was delighted to find his place located inside of the Old town (park). PEG was very friendly and knowledgeable. She made wonderful suggestions. All the wines are from the San Diego area which is a delightful change from Napa. They also have beer. I had a flight based on the recommendations of Peg and enjoyed. Great place to sit and unwind and meet people. Would recommend and will be back. Thanks !  They also have lots of trinkets and gifts for the wine/ beer enthusiast!< /Review>< pics>

<Text>My boyfriend and I went to Rose's on a whim and were so pleasantly surprised! They offer a great selection of wine and the staff are super knowledgeable. Both staff members were welcoming, friendly, and happily spent quite a bit of time talking to us about all things wine. We learned a lot and tried some great wines, overall such a nice experience!< /Text>< pics>

<rate>4< /rate><Text>I really love the wine here. And the environment. And the bartenders were very nice. I hardly ever write anything negative on yelp reviews unless I feel like a restaurant could be better from the feedback. I ordered a cheese plate, two cheeses and salami. The portions were so tiny you would think the cheese was being rationed and salami going extinct. The whole cheese plate felt sad, felt ungenerous and cheap. I really encourage the owners to figure out  a way to create a cheese plate that feels plentiful. I understand this isn't Switzerland, or France, but you can do better. Check out Fig in Santa Monica for the way it should be done.</Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

Joe and Colm were absolutely professional and so amazing!! Super knowledgeable about varius wines. I'm new to wines, and have had this misunderstanding that to understand wine you must be "bougie". Not true at all. Joe has a degree in knowledge of wine, and from what i learned first hand experience, it's not about the price or color, but your palate and what suits the individual. They educated me on various wines, their history and origin. I felt like i was at wine school, but in a fun and safe learning environment. Please, come spend your hsrd earned dollars and valuable time at Rose's Tasting Room, for a most sophisticated yet laid back experience!! You will leave impressed and refreshed, with a wine blush. Amazing products and service!! This is what separates average to exceptional business. Thank you again, Joe and Colm!! From a Midwestern's truest heart, this place is A MUST!!!<//review>

My wife and I started coming here in late May and loved the place so much that we have come back almost every single week since, sometimes twice a week!

The wine and beer are both good, all local San Diego county breweries and wineries. But the best part, the guys pouring the drinks. We were introduced to the bartender, Joe, on our first visit. He was so awesome that we knew we had to keep coming back. His knowledge of wine is second to none. He is a professionally trained sommelier and oh man does he know his stuff. I have learned more about wine than I ever thought possible. He has such a great passion for what he does and it really shows. A few months later we were introduced to Colton, another great personality and fun person to be around. Between the two of them there is no place we'd rather be or people we'd rather be around on a Saturday night.

I think it's safe to say that if you are looking for a great place to have a drink and a good conversation, this is the place to be!< /Text>

One of the bartenders is a sommalier, and was the most knowledgeable person I've talked to about wine. He knows more than just flavors; the history of wine flows as freely as the nearest Petit Sirah.< /text>

<Review>I got into a car accident and I feel like they did not complete the repairs on my car in it's entirety.
The next day after I got home, I turned on my car and all the dash lights were flickering. I ended up driving my car anyways because I needed to get to work. When I called them they said it wasn't from the accident. They ended up fixing the issue and didn't charge me- which was nice but made me feel like they knew they might have messed up somehow but didn't want to admit to any wrongdoing or mistakes.
But a day or so later my air conditioning started to not be so cold. Then my air conditioner slowly went out in about a month. I feel like my car was not repaired throughly.< /Review><Resp>None</Resp>< date>

Best place in town for alignments. I took my 2018 F150 after taking it to other local shops and not being done right multiple times. Teresa's did it right the first time and they use top of the line equipment Like they say "you get what you pay for". If you want it done right the first time go to Teresa's. Definitely recommend this shop and will be returning for all my auto needs.<//Text>

We broke a bolt for the suspension on my Lexus GX 470 while off-roading in Death Valley and this was the closest shop. They provide professional service and were very friendly. They didn’t even charge us because the it was just a single bolt.

I would highly recommend them for such quality and helpful service.

Thanks so much Ray and your team for taking care of us!<//text>< GmapID>

This is late in writing and it shouldn't have been because they were so quick to respond!  Extremely helpful, on a Sunday morning no less, in getting us on our way.  Everyone was great, and went over and above in every possible way.  Can't say enough about how wonderful they are and how much I will endorse them!< /Text>

Teresa and her team are incredible. We were towed by Tim when we had a tire blow on the 58. He went above and beyond in making sure that we had water, making good conversation on the long drive, waiting patiently while I tried to work things out with our insurance, and even dropping us off at a motel for the night. Teresa herself was also very patient and continuously helpful as we went back and forth with the insurance company the next morning. She even gave us bubble wrap to protect our stuff when we had to move it to a rental car. Also, the shop dog Elle is the sweetest dog you will ever meet. Cannot recommend highly enough the professionalism and customer service here.</Text>

It was highly recommended, but unfortunately I had a bad experience.  Communication was poor and the job was not completed on time. Not to mention it had not been completed on its entirely by the time of pick up. Overall not really thrilled with the end product.< /Review>

There are no words for how accommodating Roy & Teresa were!  This was a Sunday afternoon fix on a holiday weekend, unbelievable service. And the charge was low, way lower than it should have been.  I will consider driving out to Ridgecrest for all my car service after the way they treated us Sunday.

I used their towing service. They were nice and professional.
Unfortunately something happened and my auto insurance didn't pay them directly. So I had to go to their business office and pay the bill. They were also nice and even met the owner. It took some time to find my towing paperwork, but I was able to take care of my bill.</Text>

I called at 5 pm on a Sunday with a RV stuck in a trench within 45 minutes they showed up with all the equipment needed to handle the job. Ray and his crew did a excellent job making sure every precaution was taken to not damage the vehicle.  I highly recommend this company for any of your hauling needs. Great job guys and thanks again for the prompt professional service!!!!!< /Review>

If you want your car to look like it did when it came out of the show room, this is the place.  Very conscientious and very good eye for detail.  They worked well with my State Farm insurance provider.<//Review>

A local business in town had a dog that jumped on the side of my truck and left large scratches down the passenger door so I went to Teresa's to get an estimate. The receptionist came out and used rubbing compound and took out all the scratches and made my truck look brand new for no charge. I would totally recommend this place to anyone!</text>

Costco has the bulk items I've come to depend upon for stocking up. Buying in bulk is retail's version of Wall Street's "dollar cost averaging." You WILL have to purchase (whatever), so buying that item in bulk on a less frequent schedule makes the cost per unit less than buying lesser quantities more often. Stock up, if it fits your living arrangement. Costco has hybridized the grocery store with the big box store.

When I pass someone in the parking lot with a limited number of items in their cart, I challenge them with: You call THAT a Costco run?

Most grin and happily admit: That's only what I need today.

Costco provides those options. A quick couple of desired items (grocery, clothing, household goods, jewelry, you name it) or a proverbial cart load or two of typically dry goods to last months-long duration. Costco is the place.</Text>

Everyone knows Costco is an excellent warehouse. Majority of the cashiers are friendly. Only some cashiers need more training in customer service and courtesy.< /Review>

<review>The staff for the most part is helpful, and they are always polite.
Also, a lot of the  other customers have assisted me as needed without me asking, which I really appreciate since I hate asking anyone for help with anything.
Bummer the restrooms are going to be closed for a while, I got that rude awakening the other morning....like couldn’t this wait until the pandemic settles down?</review>< GmapID>

There is no way you are following CDC, State, or County Guidelines. Far too many people in the store. So many customers without masks? Ridiculous. You can do a better job. I also work in customer service for an international company. For those customer that we serve that do not want to follow guidelines we respectfully part ways.

I love Costco, but I spend too much money there! This one is great, the parking lot is a little tight compared to most other Costcos, but I enjoyed it overall. They were sold out of paper towels and bath tissue at the time of my visit. They run a tight ship and the staff was friendly and active. Thank you</Review>

Today Sept 27, I saw many people did not wear masks inside the very crowded wear house.  I hope the manager enforce NO MASK NO ENTER NO SERVICE to protect the shoppers with face masks on.
I dont see the sign NO MASK NO SERVICE.  I hope Costco Main Corporate office see this and do something about this.<//Text>

Parking is horrible.  But I thought inside was going to be the same.  It was not to bad. I did see Costco workers clean shopping carts , freezer handles and  all register lines was not to bad. And a plus all customers wearing there mask. ☺< /Text>

This Costco doesn't adhere to Covid protocols. As long as customers have a mask somewhere on their face they're allowed to shop. It was very alarming to see customer after customer shopping with masks hanging below their noses and from their chins. I stood back and watched these same customers check out without anyone saying anything about Covid protocols. This Costco is a joke. They're not looking out for their customers and as long as you have money to spend Costco employees will take it and keep their mouths shut.
My next notice will be to the health department.<//Text>

Older man CARLOS (member 111878581875) was superrr rude to me because I went in for a return. I didn’t even want money back, I was willing to just exchange for a working one and he was so disrespectful and rude! I hope Costco isn’t taking my refund off his paycheck! 🤭 I will never shop at this location again! Sams club is right up the street!</text>

< Review>
A clean and spacious costco with attentive staff, speedy checkers and an all around good vibe. Others in the area can be extremely crowded and gave more convoluted parking layouts, adding needless time to your shopping trip. This one is conveniently located next to a home depot, and many other stores and restaurants within the river park shopping center which is 2 blocks away or so. Highly recommend for an efficient shopping experience.< /Review>

Costco has quite a variety of products (food, flowers, home furnishings, holiday decor, plants, clothing, prescriptions, bedding, pet care, etc.) and they always have something new. Their return policy is excellent! Their tires are comparable to any other tire place as they're not cheaper in bulk. Lines can be super smooth or super crazy, depending in what time of day you go. The convenience of having a gas station with very reasonable prices is awesome. They have lights to guide you to the stations that are empty and this helps to speed the process.<//Text>

Everytime I go to this gas station the over charge me. I spent 28 dollars on gas and they charged me 85 dollars. Then when I call them they hangup. I am looking forward to going doing there tomorrow. It's the end of the month. It's holloween and I was trying to doing something extra for my babies and now I can't because they took my money that I had extra. So frustrating.< /Review>

First time shopping at this location in a long while. I was a little disappointed about not finding a couple of items, but I realize that it's all because of the times we are living in. All in all it was a good shopping experience. Thank you Costco!</Text>

Wow, this location is the worst service, I was trying to reopen my member but their team had only one person to do that and we had 4 people was behind me.... I was waiting almost 30’ but the Latina girl with long hair was running around like duck but did not help, she was acting like a manager or supervisor, I talked to her but seemed like she didn’t even care to have more people help. I’ve chosen not to open member and left because of the service the Costco this location provided. It was 2:50 pm 09/02/20👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 👎🏻👻👻</text>

I've dealt with some people at the membership counter who tried to convince me that I'm saving money when I'm spending more than what I'm getting. They persuade you to spend so much money to gain 2 % but you need to pay $120 for executive membership, but I think there's a cheaper way of getting 2 % cash back through your credit card without spending $120.< /text>

I hate coming here but they have everything so it's a good place to come to if you're trying to buy in bulk.  It's much cheaper than other stores the only downside is that you have to be a member.<//text>

<Text>They had everything we wanted. It was quite busy but employee's were able to keep up. I just wish that shoppers would wear their masks the right way. This was my first trip out after being in isolation because of major surgery. Can't they be told to leave? I heard that the governor is making up strike teams to enforce people wearing masks and finding businesses that don't make people wear them. It could be just a  rumor.< /Text><username>VENNETT GARDINI<//username><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Costco is a good place to shop. Since COVID today is the first time I've been to Costco since March. I'm not pleased with the large number of patrons w/o masks or with their noses hanging out. There is a large number who have no notion of boundaries. I was not amused by shoppers who felt a need to reach in front of me for items and even placing their bodies up against mine. Low stars because of clientele.</Review>< Rating>

This is a great Costco (but in Fresno?  Seriously?).  Liked the fact that they open at 9 am and they have a great selection of spirits, wine and beer.  What am I missing?  The fresh prime beef, the meat department, the cheeses...everything is top-grade.  Can it get better?  You betcha.  We got out of there in no time.  A-1 Service.  This is a good Costco (not so much in Albuquerque...D'oh!).<//review>

<Review>Well, I always like going to Costco. . But I found that the one in Fresno. Off of Blackstone The gas station lead in is a little bit. Confusing and hectic. And I also noticed when I was checking out there is no self checkout, which is always a plus. For me when I'm not buying alcohol. . Just food for thought.</Review><user>106396169093380585584</user><resp>None</resp><pictures>None< /pictures><rate>3</rate><date>1580963054840<//date><GmapID>0x809442aa1938e53b:0x4c301bffb12ed29a< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>I want to Thank Employee MICA for being so helpful and assisting me and my husband today, I talked to three different employees regarding a frustrating situation, and MICA was the only one that cared enough, and took the time to help us. I hope the store supervisors see this, and I hope more employees take the initiative that Mica did to help, after all we do pay $120 membership right? Thank you Mica. You made us want to keep paying our membership.< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>Costco is doing great on having needed items  available like toilet paper, paper towels and disinfecting wipes during COVID. Currently have their pumpkin pies out! Yum! Christmas cookie supplies & kits are also available now. It was very crowed today which was disappointing considering we aren't out of the woods yet.< /Review><rating>5</rating>< gmap_id>

Costco is even better during the pandemic - - not so crowded, and the lines are much shorter. After the first few days of the lockdown, there have been no lines to get in the store, and all the great retail and food products are available as well as before, even TP.< /Review>

<review>All lanes open. 10th in line when I started. The cats better appreciate me braving this to feed them. Got through the line a lot quicker than I anticipated. Getting out of the parking lot was another story. Who designed the parking lot and the approaches?< /review>< pictures>

So this Costco unlike most allows people to put others at risk by allowing masks to be worn inappropriately or allowing some people to walk through the store without masks..I wish I had taken a picture but I did not. Stick to clovis if you can and know how to follow rules.<//Text>

There's a new Costco! The parking lot layout is awesome! The gas station location is awesome! It's bigger than normal Costco's which is cool. The inside layout seems slightly different? I'm not sure, but it's no big deal. The food court is on point and I look forward to shopping here.< /review>

Pretty much exactly what you'd expect if you've ever been to Costco.  Selection and service and under the current circumstances, better than average handling of the Covid-19 issues of safety and responsibility.< /Text>

The best value, great food samples, fast check out. The best secret of all, you can return anything even if you bought it a year ago with out a receipt no questions asked.</text>

I use the gas station pretty much every week, it's either this location or the one in Clovis. It's always busy but i go there Sunday mornings so I'm pretty much have nothing else to do. I'm not gonna say anything about Costco itself I'm sure everyone who's reviewing is a member and knows the deal :p<//Review>

It's Costco... the gases price just right everything else is in bulk however you can't go into the store and not spend more than $100 for some reason even though you only buy three items so. But it is Costco<//Text>

I love the selection of items at this location. I normally go to Costcoin a smaller town, and don't find the exact same things. The downside is that this location is extremely crowded. The parking lot is crazy, and the food court/checkout area is packed. I suggest going early or late.<//Review>

Employees are nice and helpful, including the tire place in case you need to fill the tires of your car up with air. The only issue, but this happens with all Costco locations is traffic, parking and checkout lines. They need to look into incorporating a checkout system like Sam’s Club’s, where you can scan and pay with your phone. You grab and scan items as you go and once you are ready, you checkout and just walk out the door.<//review>

I love going to Costco because the staff is always happy and friendly. Long lines,but it moves quickly.  And even though they were closed,they still served from the concession for that last minute bite. Its clean and organized. Although I always come put buying more than I planned with the sales.< /text>

<text>Went to Costco for two items toilet paper and a men's electric razor the store had neither item in stock, additionally wanted to see if they carried carpet shampooers and of course they did not.

Crazy crowded ... expected though because 2 days before Thanksgiving. Only really annoying thing that happened to me was that the cart jockey almost ran into me while I was sitting on my walker. Otherwise best to keep your sense of humor and make sure that you communicate your intent to turn. Cart jams everywhere today<//Text>

Costco is an amazing place and I love shopping there with my family. It's always a great experience and I always find everything I need there from diapers to baked goods to technology everything is included! I highly recommend families to shop there because you get more items for a lesser price or the same price you would pay for at your normal for very stores. I just love Costco!< /review>

I just love the people who park their carts in the middle of the isles while they sample all the food, completely ignoring all the people behind them who want to go around them. "Dont mind us!" "We just want to push our carts down the isle and shop!"<//review>

They no longer count people so the stores packed ag6.and they no longer clean the carts, or require masks. A big dissapeared change. Safety 1st? Not anymore. Thet did have a bunch of t.p., the price went up ,$2.00, but understandabl. The meat prices are high! Its $5.00 more on hamburger, % double on pork chops & better cuts of meat. Not buying my meats from there. The chicken (cooked( is always a wait? Why? How come everybody wants it now? Don't horde people, or Karma will take it away from you Xbox 3! Truth.</review>

I like this Costco. The place is huge when compared to the smaller one in Clovis on the other side of town.

My complaint here, there are almost never enough registers open to support the number of people. Today was an exception, I breezed through the checkout in about 20 minutes.

Selection is great here and in some cases they have more than the other locations I shop at most frequently.

Staff: this is a hit or miss rating because you never know what you're going to get. Unlike the Clovis store where the staff are always, and I mean always, readily available and act like they are in a good mood.

I've been eyeing this TV...</text>

Shopping at Costco saves me time from having to go out of town. I'm glad and it's about time Hanford has a Costco we can all enjoy if you're a member you can enjoy the from shopping to the food court. Don't forget the gas station has the lowest price in town. I will continue being a loyal customer because I recommend to family and friends you can't go wrong. The staff is awesome.< /Review>

Love the Costco on Abby.
Just wish when people are taste testing samples, they would please move their shopping cart to one side or another to still leave a pathway for people who are still trying to shop to get where they are going.  Same goes for people walking & stopping in front of others not paying Any attention to What or Who might be near them to get bumped into, lol.
Other than that, it's great.< /text>

I actually like Costco, though now my wife and I are getting older and have walkers,  we visit much less often.  The store is to big and we just can't handle it now.< /Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Very disappointed, in customer service @ Abby St. Costco! Sonia that worked in returns 11/29/2019 provided a traumatic customer experience ! No human kindness for the elderly that had to wait out in the cold in the returns line. Customers that are returning a purchase are being punished by waiting in the long line and in the cold! Costco only cares about getting our money. Sad story!< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

Costco saves me time and gas driving into Fresno to get supplies plus now days with gas prices going up. Costco in Hanford has great deals on everything you could ever want. It's like Christmas 24.7 why go anywhere else when you have Costco. If you need to return something, no questions asked. The employees are so polite and remember they have samples in case you need a bite and decided to buy one or more items. Thank you Hanford for bringing us Costco that was a great investment.<//text>

Always the best place to find anyting. I wish their prices were lower but most items are bulk. Their lines are usually the worst part of going there. But their cashiers are always nice and friendly. Great customer service for when I can't find something or have a few questions. And the floors are always kept clean.< /Review>

Im thinking of dropping my 10 plus years membership. I hardly find staff willing to help find an item. They just point and walk away.  Cashiers won't even greet and their helpers are always on their cell phones. Overall disappointing.< /Review>

This Costco is a true reflection of the many Costco stores we have patronized.. some of the best shopping experiences we always have. Good selection, great prices, delicious food court food, free food samples, and more. A must- shop store for everyone. Kudo to Costco.< /review>

<Text>This is the second time in the last few months I purchased one of their cooked chickens. The first one I purchased was terrible uneatable. The one I purchase yesterday was fresh out of the oven but it really wasn't that good. Flavors not there and the meat on the legs didn't taste right. I fed some to my dog and it messed her up overnight. No more chickens for me from Costco in North Fresno California< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x809442aa1938e53b:0x4c301bffb12ed29a<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Typical Costco but untypical photo department. Great workers who really care about their customers. Even though it was ridiculously busy due to the Christmas rush they were always polite and made an effort to quickly get the customers needs addressed. I like the pre-paid service for the food court. It works very well.<//Text>< userid>

<review>The experience  is only a three because  of venue the manager was really sweet but the overall  experience  with dining  really  does not sit well they have limited  selection  on food  if you order  anything  from the bar it takes forever you have to remind staff repeatedly  for refills  I have been there 3 times dining  and once they forgot my kids order it took them along time to finally  get her order in  the other time we got our drinks after the meal was already  completely  done  seriously  I only go for the games  if they would  have better service and food selection  it would  be the best place in fresno< /review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Tried to ask employees who do the stocking questions. Totally got ignored. The products under several price and description placards did not match placards in grocery areas...and bakery area. The employee who helps load customers vehicles was too engrossed talking to another employee to be bothered with helping me load the heavy items in my cart into my vehicle. When he did come to help, he only loaded the 25 lb of sugar and walked away. I had a cart full of items to be loaded. I am 73 and have herniated discs in my neck and lower back. Not a good experience at all today at this Costco.<//Text>

I love Costco.  I recently bought groceries ( efficient and fast). I filled the gas tank ( which actually only takes 10 minutes or less with a long line).  I enjoyed the new southwestern salad ( it has soy instead of meat, but tastes darn good).  I brought in two returns in less that a few weeks.  Each only took five minutes or less. Costco is my go to for healthy food in bulk, dried fruits, rotisserie chicken, and housewares with prices that can't be beat.<//Text>

<time>1554922899312</time><rating>3</rating><Text>Now I love Costco for itself!! But to be honest, the staff are freaking rude. There is no excuse me as their walking by pushing a big bin. If you find any staff on the floor their usually talking & yapping amongst themselves. If you need any help it's like such a bother for them to help you. The cashiers dont even bother to talk to their customers. Their too busy talking to the person boxing the food. Now come on!! Where the hell is the customer service?? The staff act like they are better than. If it wasnt for the fact Costco is a great store where you can get bulk food for a good price I'd never go back. The customer service sucks!! Now I'm sure there are a few awesome that excel at customer service & go above, but not from what I'm witnessing for the past few months. Again just 1 persons opinion.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Good gas prices, I mainly go there for the gas, the store is more often than not crowded and hard to find parking.
Gas lines can be long, but going early morning is great.</review>

Wish they would open up all the check out lines when it gets busy. Lines get very long at times. Should have a couple of 15 items or less or maybe a self checkout for $150.00 or less. Bring back the Polish hot dog.< /review>

This is one of my favorite locations, way better than the Shaw & 99 location for sure! And the Clovis one is still way too packed!<//review>

<review>COSTCO Vision - Abby St.

So far so good. I went in today with a prescription and waited about 15 minutes to be served. The lady was very nice and checked on my insurance to see what all the coverage I had available before addressing my needs for lenses and frame. Worked out my selection and order is expected within 7 days. Good experience.

Update: Glasses showed up in 4 working days. I got to the store at 9:45 and they were already opened. I was done and headed home in twenty minutes. Another good experience. I recommend this Costco location!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<text>Costco can't be beat. My rebate on all shopping done there practically pays for the yearly fee. Maybe it's only $20 then.
I buy as much of my grocery list as I can there, before finishing at WinCo. Many items are not in bulk, so I have many choices. Staples are really cheap!
I do a lot of cooking from scratch so a 25# sack of sugar and 25# flour is not too big for me. Many of the canned items such as pinto, garbanzo, tom. sauce, are sold in sets of 6 15-oz cans.

<Rate>4<//Rate><review>I love Costco, but I hate that it's so hard to find an employee to ask a question/get help. I also hate when they a get a product in and then they run out for months at a time (someone needs to do a better job of ordering) or they just never bring it back. Good prices, return line is always long, employees are hit and miss (some are super nice and others are awful), check out lines are almost always long.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None</resp><GmapID>0x809442aa1938e53b:0x4c301bffb12ed29a<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Lisa at the cell phone kiosk was marvelous. Super intelligent IT speaking but also very articulate. She was a super multi tasker. She was setting up and transferring info from your old phone to your new phone. 4 phones at a time, two different operating systems. She is doing work of at least two people. She definitely needs a raise and commission, a bonus, employee of the month etc.< /review>

<Text>Costco shopping is a monthly event. I always dread it because it is ALWAYS WAY.....TOO.... CROWDED. Good for Costco but... since they switched from American Express to Citi cards it got nuts. They've expanded the produce area which is great but way too large of portions for 2 people. Great for family's or businesses. Too many times I've bought onions and potatoes etc. Unfortunately a good deal of the bag is rotted product. Employees are amazing! Very helpful and good moods!!!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Free food samples are always good. The managers used to be pretty rude, hopefully this has improved. Hopefully they treat employees well.<//Text>

<Review>I love Costco, but I hate that it's so hard to find an employee to ask a question/get help. I also hate when they a get a product in and then they run out for months at a time (someone needs to do a better job of ordering) or they just never bring it back. Good prices, return line is always long, employees are hit and miss (some are super nice and others are awful), check out lines are almost always long.< /Review>< Date>

The parking.. terrible. The lines.. terrible. The inside.. terrible. In a nutshell it could use improvement. It's difficult to maneuver inside. When you compare it to Sam's Club, it's almost a joke. This Costco is dirty, grungy, and just down right a nightmare. It's prices are not some wild thing when you actually compare product for product against Sam's Club(matter of fact Sam's is cheaper on 9/10 products). The only thing I will say, is Costco muffins are better, but that is the ONLY thing. If you're going to go here, make sure you set aside adequate time, there is no quick trip to Costco with the parking and extreme lines. I most definitely will not be letting go of my Sam's Club membership, and will be cancelling Costco for sure.</Text>

Go early and avoid   crowds.  It is the best time.   Costco is always ready when the doors open and  nobody is stocking merchandise.< /review>

<Text>Who doesn't love Costco? I always spend more than i need to every time i go. Stick to a list because it's easy being sidetracked.

The store is always clean and well stocked. Great variety of product and if you can't find what you're looking for, try again in a few day. The lines are always long, but they move quickly. They have some great, unique items.< /text>

Pharmacy was very accommodating. Decided to wait "a few minutes" at Food court for "Combo"/supreme pizza order to come out of oven rather than get different flavor. I didn't realize I had to stand in the Pick Up line and have the receipt until over ten minutes passed.</Review>

<review>What needs to be said? It's Costco! The people who work here are friendly, the customers are not. The employees keep the store clean and have been very quick & helpful when my boys have made a mess. I cannot praise the checkout people enough, they recognize us & joke with us on our weekly visits. Good prices on most items, most of the time. When certain items are on sale, grab as many as you can. We keep coming back!</review>< Pics>

Great prices.  I wished the clerk's paid attention to what they are doing.  Hot chicken in cold bag on top of eggs.  Bacon & cheese not put in cold bag at all. They were so busy talking to each other they didn't say a word to me until they wanted my money.<//review>

I shop in bulk for a family of six. I see many friends there. I find savings there, as I get more for my $$$. They go out of their to help me with putting heavy things in my cart. I'm disabled so they load my things into my car & they are always pleasant & happy to assist.
One other comment: it's very enlightening  that others are so willing to help me, from your children to others like me. If I'm struggling, I'll barrow another  delighted lady's husband. I'm amazed at how many people are so willing to help other. This gives me hope for the future of human kindnesses.< /Text>

I don't have a membership but often go on my lunch break and I'm glad they added a couple touch screens to order your food and pay with a debit card. Once it prints out your receipt, show it at the pick up area and your on your way. It's convenient if there's a long line or don't have cash on hand. The self order doesn't accept cash only cards.</review>

<text>Prices are great, especially the monthly specials where there is manufacturer discount.  Especially appreciate customer service and return policy.
Only concern are the lines and customers.  All the staff are exceptional and works like crazy to get everyone through but there are so many people.  They always have a great attitude even though they work very hard.
Now if only the customers/members were the same way.  Half nice, half rude, cut you off, leave their cart in the middle of the aisle. It's a dog eat dog mentality. Everyone acts like it's black Friday every day.</text>< Date>

It is Costco. There is nothing special about the cookie cutter big box. If you hit it at the off peak hours you are golden. Spoiler alert. If you don't, you're hosed.</Text>

I don't have a membership but often go on my lunch break and I'm glad they added a couple touch screens to order your food and pay with a debit card. Once it prints out your receipt, show it at the pick up area and your on your way. It's convenient if there's a long line or don't have cash on hand. The self order doesn't accept cash only cards.<//review>

This is the best Costco in the Valley.   Check-out is quick and efficient.  If you have questions, employees are easily available and very friendly!  Good management at this Costco is noticed through the employees.</review>

<Review>All l can say is I feel I can always count on costco for a good product for a reasonable price. Even with their outside vendors .I know costco has done the vetting and they will stand behind it so you can relax and not worry about the fine print . Just love it.<//Review><Date>1550637834740< /Date>< user>

<Review>I shop in bulk for a family of six. I see many friends there. I find savings there, as I get more for my $$$. They go out of their to help me with putting heavy things in my cart. I'm disabled so they load my things into my car & they are always pleasant & happy to assist.
One other comment: it's very enlightening  that others are so willing to help me, from your children to others like me. If I'm struggling, I'll barrow another  delighted lady's husband. I'm amazed at how many people are so willing to help other. This gives me hope for the future of human kindnesses.</Review>< username>

<text>Very disappointed to find Michelle Obama's book were all faced down.  I thought just 1 or 2 however everyone  on them were faced down. There even other books stacked on top. I flipped all of them back over.  I'm not sure why such hate but it's unnecessary. I'm going to return and see if they are faced down. If so, then I know it's the store doing it. Please talk to your employees. Let's not continue to hate.</text>< pictures>

This Costco is my favorite in Fresno because the location is super convenient, but it can be pretty crowded on weekends and before holidays. They do have a lot of registers open and the lines move pretty quickly so that is a plus. They carry a couple of items here that they don't have at the West Shaw Costco.<//text>

Not what used to be. Sam's club is really out shining Costco. Costco is crowded, small, and crammed with merchandise so tightly it's often a challenge navigating the store. The prices on bulk items used to set it apart from all other retailers. But now Sam's Club prices often undercut Costco and they sell more conveniently sized food items that make it a better value than Costco.<//Review>

My experice wasn't pleasant. Someone needs to have a talk with employees  regarding customer service.  I Went there this past Sunday and asked Paul a simple question. He was incredibly rude and dismissive of my question.  I am pretty tolerant of people, but this was just very rude.<//text>

Had me waiting 40 minutes for a pizza.!!! They  reassured me they would call my number.  And it would be no more than 20 minutes. 40 minutes later. I asked for a refund. And they magically had my pizza ready all of a sudden. And said it had been ready !!??? Saying I didn't hear them even though I was standing at the front counter watching and listening.  Pathetic joke of service.  do no waste money on there food court. Horrible service. Airheads and the best part. When I brought to her attention she never called my number , she said , and I quote "so" her name was Lexi.< /Text>

<text>Love shopping for bulk items here one of my favorites is Artichoke Dip. Lines are way to long mainly ALL THE TIME. I'm sure they can accommodate changes so customers can express the happiness of the fair prices and  anticipation for a overall 5 star, but year after year it's a drag knowing that line will bel long and slow and just makes me want to rush.<//text>< gmap_id>

Get ready for 20 mins of looking for parking and 2 hours of trying to shop with 1000 other shoppers and then 30 minutes in line to pay!

Great store and service though! Just overwhelming experience! Sam's Club across the way and down the street a bit is just as awesome but way less people!< /Review>

I want to thank Mr Jack Kojekian, sales supervisor at Costco. He is one of a kind, best person to understand my problem and helped me beyond my expectation or imagination. And ofcourse, all the staff around him were nice to me too. I felt or treated as a valued customer because of him. Thank you.<//Text>

I LOVE this store, BUT, I had a really infuriating experience tonight.

I shop here all the time and it's always a very quick experience. And have never bought anything really expensive, the lines are pretty short, customer service is phenomenal, And only once have I ever gone there for an item and they were out of stock. I came in around 7:00 on a Wednesday because like me, most people have day jobs.

Tonight, yes I know it's only 7 days before Christmas... I came in for a couple cheap Christmas gifts but one in particular is one of the expensive items ($179.99) that you need to get from the merchandise counter after you have paid for it....First I gave them my receipt and waited almost 20 minutes before they told me they couldn't find the item in the back room.

A few minutes later there is a girl out front taking receipts and she tells me that they need to go look through the pallets in the entire store to see if they can find it. I asked for my receipt and go load up my car with the other items that I bought and come back, took maybe 8 mins, return, give them my receipt and wait... Mind you, I ordered a large pepperoni pizza when I was at the register.

Wait for another 17 minutes before they tell me they can't find my item even though they have 19 in stock in the store.  I was told to be issued a refund and that I need to call back to see if they found out where it was. I feel like they should probably be the ones calling me at this point.

Got in line to be issued a refund which took about 10 minutes because the girl they referred me to was doing other things away from the counter. Finally got my refund and found out it takes 24 to 48 hours to be refunded.  Also I was charged $199.99 instead of the $179.99 price tag.  Picked up my pizza, hardly warm to the touch of the box and drive home. COLD upon my arrival at home.  I probably should have asked for my pizza to be comped but THAT line was about 15 people long.

I feel that there could have been a lot better communication through the process of this deal and maybe they could have held my money and called ME in the morning to tell me it was in fact there and I could pick it up...or not, Then issued me a refund.

I probably won't buy anything over $100 from Costco in the future unless it's a gift card. I know it's not the fault of those specific workers, but I was extremely tired from standing on my feet all day at work and having to wait almost an hour on my feet at the end of the day was extremely frustrating for me, there are no benches near that area. I hope that they figure out a better way to locate their inventory in the future. Having 19 boxes of this tablet available I'm sure that they weren't missing entirely.

Thanks for being a productive awesome store typically, but I hope I'm the only one that has been stuck in this situation.  I was in the store a LOT longer than intended.</Text>

<Review>This is the best Costco in the Fresno area. Big selection zone great staff and customer service with a smile. Thru have their pharmacy, bakery, meat department, eye center and photo lab all set up and user friendly. They get busy crazy on weekends but they're worth it and take care of their customers.<//Review>< pictures>

It's a nice Costco, but it's always busy. You have to fight your way through the crowds in order to get anywhere. Do not come here if you have other plans.< /Text>

Costco is how u run a business right. Me and my fami lm y have been coming to costco for many years, and not once has costco or either of the two locations we shop at  let us down. The staff is friendly and the service is excellent. You can always find unique hema from imported cheese to vintage vines and locally sourced produce. Even their frozen offerings are high quality (Hello jalapeno poppers!).  I had most of my prescription glasses developed at costco. although I have my glasses developed at Walmart in madera since I live close to it, the staff at the optical center are always willing clean mu glasses despite not having my glasses developed over there. Sometimes Costco has some the best deals u can find (I once bought a 3 pack of video games, not to mention they sell gaming consoles that come with two AAA games. u want a model of how a business should be run, look no further than costco.</text>

I was at the gas station on this day. I love this Costco Gas Station there are over 20 pumps, the left two or three islands have Desiel and gas. Do not leave if it looks full or is full of cars, there are so many pumps the line goes extremely fast. All the Costco locations should have Desiel and they should all have three pumps per isle, and at least 10 Isles like this location.</review>

I like this Costco. The place is huge when compared to the smaller one in Clovis on the other side of town.

My complaint here, there are almost never enough registers open to support the number of people. Today was an exception, I breezed through the checkout in about 20 minutes.

Selection is great here and in some cases they have more than the other locations I shop at most frequently.

Staff: this is a hit or miss rating because you never know what you're going to get. Unlike the Clovis store where the staff are always, and I mean always, readily available and act like they are in a good mood.

I've been eyeing this TV...<//text>

< review>
I went to this location today 9/9/18 to print photos since the location near where I live took out their photo department. I  walk in and their system was down. The guy running the area tells me this and to try Clovis and walks away very rudely. So I  drive to Clovis racing the clock and I get there figuring I could put in my order and pick it on Monday. Not a chance, the person running told they close at 6 and no orders after 5:30 and walks away before I  could even say anything. So 2 rude people back to back at 2 separate locations.</review>

Just wanted to inform others that until there's another one built this is still your best option for parking and congestion. Also the staff here are some of the best. Pretty sure that this is the first Costco for the area and with WinCo next door makes it a one-and-done stop. Stock up on all+gas! Now if I can convince the top brass to put one like this in Prather.< /Text>

A lot of items to be found here.  Highly recommend buying more of what you love, as they often don't replenish the stock on things.<//Review>

We have been Costco members for many years. This week we went there to purchase the Little Giant Ladder for $169 to hang our Christmas lights. They had one product left. It was obviously used because there was no original packaging left on it and dirty, dirty, dirty ! I told my husband to grab it and we could talk to the manager and see what they could do. He spoke to a manager named Nick.  What he had to say floored us! "No, we can't discount it. We can send it back to the vendor for full credit or I can use it as a floor display" (talking to him like a child in a sarcastic voice not professional at all). I told my husband they can stick it up their BUTT! The entire time he was there talking to him, I was on the phone looking at Amazon Prime! Found it for $129. Money was not the issue here. First, we are paying customers. You don't treat customers like this AT ALL!  You treat people with dignity and respect. ALWAYS! Second, don't place something on the floor USED and expect people to pay full price for it! That is NOT fair! In fact, I call that a RIP OFF! I usually don't write reviews but I'm PISSED OFF and find it unfair and unjust that Costco would treat us like this . SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON NICK for being RUDE AND SARCASTIC TO MY HUSBAND!< /Text>

< review>
I was going to the one in Clovis and I've always liked this location until they hired a hater!  Some white dude that checks your receipt @ on your way out!  Maybe he's racist or something not sure, but dude was laughing like somebody told him a joke or something !  I was with my Mom and my girl and dude was cracking up before we entered the store and after we entered also!  I turned around and this scrum bag is still laughing at us!!  Why do they hire people like that?  If you can't have kindness and compassion towards people then you shouldn't be working at Costco!<//review>

<text>This place is always busy, but you can get a whole lot on wholesale for cheap. You can also get a snack, like slices of pizza, or a hot dog and soda, or something else from the menu. Costco is always good for returning something that is defective, or not the right size.<//text><pics>None< /pics>< Response>

<Review>Corperate Costco. They have great deals , 1 of a kind items that for the most part are wonderful .  Bakery and deli always favs, flowers , great for hostess of any events ...but ...the location is on North side of town and it's not so receptive unless your diamonds ate flashing ajd gold polished up. Across town.. not quite so many staff gawkers ..uncomfortable ..( who gets outta there will those big boxes and bags of anything ? Just sayin' ) clean( don't mess it up please) orderly, lines are not bad so don't fuss around and delay your cashier. Get done and on. Snak bar is super . Staffs nice clean and of course. Costco value ..awesome frozen yogurt and hot dogs ..enjoy<//Review>< Pics>

< review>
Like most Costco's, this one is always busy, usually clean, and normally has everything a family needs to keep stocked for the month. Not my favorite place because of all the people, but the staff is usually friendly and helpful, and it doesn't hurt that they almost always have samples going. Solid 4/5.<//review>

<text>I own my own business and have been a member at Costco for 20 years and recently went to this location. I entered the store with my backpack on because I had a $2,500. computer that I didn't feel comfortable leaving in the car. I proceeded to shop with my wife and daughter and as we were leaving with our weekly two carts of merchandise they told me that they had to check my backpack. I told them "you have no grounds for searching my personal space" they said that when you join that everybody signs off the right to Costco to search any members person space at any moment. There was no probable cause, I told them if they make me open my backpack I was going to cancel my membership and the supervisor shrugged his shoulders and said go right on in over to the counter and cancel it with his I don't really care attitude.  I felt they profiled me and showed little care for such a long term customer. They had 5 employees outside that looked like that were going to take me down if I wouldn't let them search. I run a popular, reputable retail business in town, I wouldn't randomly ask people to open they'er bags. I spend about $30,000 there a year but no more, I cancelled. If they are going to profile and search me down when I shop, I will choose elsewhere. They have a bad I don't care attitude maybe coming down from management. If they are going to open bags or backpacks they need to warn they'er customers when they come through the door that way they can have the choice to expose there personal belongings.< /text>< Pics>

< Review>
last year I had a warranty return and the manager refused my return with the excuse that the matters has stains on it and just left me standing in line and won't talk to me anymore, I tried to call customer service and one of your customers passing by me, yelled scumbag, scumbag, scumbag, your staff did not do anything to her, apparently they agreed. I had to go back home with it, and had to make calls to you and the factory so I can do my return and I proved I deserved the return and was able to finally return it, the other manager tried to give me a gift card and all I asked for that I just want to shop like anyone else, since then I hated going to your store because I keep remembering the horrible experiences I had to face there, a year went by and I got my certificates ( cashback and rewards ) from my membership and Costco Citi, my wife went to the store and finished her shopping and she ran through the same manager that refused to cash it after he looked at my name on it, with an excuse that it has to be the same person, even that I know my wife has the right to cash it, I spoke nicely with him on the phone, explained we got the same last name, same address, same membership, he was mean and refused to cash it, he even lied and said that my wife has to be authorized user in my Citi card, this information is not true, she does not have to, and there’s no way for him to check on that, again my wife left the store without getting her service done for no reason, I contacted customer service and spoke with Sandy and she did not believe me first, till she called Citi and verified that my information is correct and she agreed that apparently this warehouse is not acting properly and she told me she’s going to file a complaint on my behalf against this manager, 3 days went by with no calls and I cannot go shop into my store because I do not want this to be escalated into a verbal confrontation  with someone like that, I called again spoke with Kristine, I had to repeat the whole thing and she sided with your warehouse manager and did not believe me and kind of dared me to contact Citi and of course she was embarrassed when she found I was true and she had the wrong information, I asked for her supervisor Elaine got on the line and she came already with attitude, telling me that they did nothing wrong and the manager following the LAW, I was not sure what law she’s referring to and why that’s such a big deal to understand, she told me I can get an exception, I again explain I do not need exception and I need my wife to go to any register and just do her shopping she refused and told me she cannot grantee when the warehouse will correct their policy, I called Citi next day since I gave up on Costco since that’s what your supervisors behavior is, and the warehouse said it will contact me same day and of course there’s nothing.< /Review>

<review>Costco is how u run a business right. Me and my fami lm y have been coming to costco for many years, and not once has costco or either of the two locations we shop at  let us down. The staff is friendly and the service is excellent. You can always find unique hema from imported cheese to vintage vines and locally sourced produce. Even their frozen offerings are high quality (Hello jalapeno poppers!).  I had most of my prescription glasses developed at costco. although I have my glasses developed at Walmart in madera since I live close to it, the staff at the optical center are always willing clean mu glasses despite not having my glasses developed over there. Sometimes Costco has some the best deals u can find (I once bought a 3 pack of video games, not to mention they sell gaming consoles that come with two AAA games. u want a model of how a business should be run, look no further than costco.< /review>< Pics>

The gas prices are great!< /text><resp>None< /resp>< Rating>

< review>
Wish they opened earlier around 7am. In the summer living in Clovis ca it is getting to hot at 10am. Today over 95 at 10am. Parking lot is a maze of rude drivers. Even ruder people inside.  I drove across town to this store to find out what I was after was recalled at all store. The first store should have said something so I didn't waist my time and fuel.<//review>

They usually have all or a majority of Lanes open. Wait times are not bad despite high volume of shoppers.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><Text>I like Costco because they have larger sizes for less, most of the time. You should comparison shop for the best deals. If you see something new in clothes, toys, shoes or housewares that you really want, buy it then.  If you don't, when you go back to get it, it will probably be sold out.</Text>< Pictures>

Costco has become a place of rotten fruit, merchandise that other distributors have deemed unworthy to carry, and wait times at the register and gas station that require at 20 minutes on average. Most of their tools/big items seem to be of poor quality when checked on Amazon. The people at the checkout stands are rude always talking to themselves and the return line is always full. This costco does seem to have a better selection of healthy food and the pet food selection is good. The buyer at this location appears to chose items not available at other locations. Paying $120 to shop here is becoming questionable.</text>

I don't like how they are always changing the locations of the items. You get used to where everything is, then bam. They change everything! Other than this, Costco is a very good store.<//text>

Long lines and pushes customers. Good thing is bulk items and low prices on each item. The key is u have to use every item. If 1 or 2 unit goes to waste, then u paid more per item.<//Text>

Despite always being busy, store is always well-kept, service is efficient, and lots of wonderful deals. 4 stars because sometimes the actual customer service leaves more to be desired.< /Review>

<Text>Not the best experience. I was signing up for a new membership and applying for their Citi card when an employee walked up and started video recording the interaction. I called and complained. The manager apologized but stated that she wasn't doing anything wrong, pretty sure that you can't record people without their approval and then there's the issue of violation of my privacy with my sensitive information.</Text>< user_name>

<Review>I trust their Kirkland brand good. Their alergy medice is a fraction of the cost that other brands charge. The kids love the samples. Their food court is awesome. Where else can you get a dinner frank style hotdog and a soda for $1.50. And more over it is a good quality dog. Not a chicken frank. Their pizza is also a crowd pleaser. This place is well worth the cost of membership.<//Review>< pictures>

<Rate>1< /Rate><text>My husband and I took our 4 month old son to Costco today in river park . After shopping we decided to stop at the food court for lunch . As I am in standing in line I happen to glance over at the tables where MANY MANY people were sitting and eating and noticed a a man woman sitting next to each other . As I was about to turn away I saw the man reach his hand into the ladies pants and start caressing her butt .. This went on for several minutes . He was not caressing her butt to be nice , it was extremely sexual . I grabbed my food and then walked over to customer service and told TWO employees what was going on . The looked over and AGAIN the man had his hand in the woman's pants ... To my surprise THE EMPLOYEES DID NOTHING ! they simply stood for a minute and then both walked in opposite directions . Neither one addressed the couple and security was not alerted . I told my husband there was no way In hell we were sticking around to eat . We grabbed out stuff and left ... I am very disappointed in Costco today . With a food court full of families and children they just continue to let that activity happen ..... Needless to say I won't be go back to that location anymore !< /text>< pictures>

I had a bad experience at this cosco today
While I was shopping I found a item that did not have a  price on it I was trying to figure it out i got help from a worker but she said she couldn't figure out the price so she send me to a clerk but when I was ready to check the price he said that at cosco they are not allowed to check the price and he told me " are you going to buy the item or not" he was really mad that I wanted to know the price. Cosco should have a price check machine if the clerks have a bad attitude.</Text>

I've never had a good experience at any Costco .  The employees are rude especially the check out clerks . They either looked hyped on steroids, tattooed or absolutely depressed. Been a member for 10 + years. Guess I'll give up my executive membership and go to Sam's club.<//review>

<Review>I've never had a good experience at any Costco .  The employees are rude especially the check out clerks . They either looked hyped on steroids, tattooed or absolutely depressed. Been a member for 10 + years. Guess I'll give up my executive membership and go to Sam's club.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>One of the cashiers was racists to me I asked if they where open and she answera me with que no hablo ingles. That kind of made me mad cause I'm Mexican like why would she say that like I didn't know how to speak English when I asked her if the line was open. then she goes on and calls me mr grumpy and that I have no sense of humor I got even more mad.

This visit was only to get gasoline.  It can be quite crowded but this day we went through nicely. The price below $2.80 is a definite plus. Membership and accepted payment method but no cash for payment.</text>
