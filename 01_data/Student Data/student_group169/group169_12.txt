<review>Arrived at the store at 11 am on a Sunday (2/16/20), the crew cannot take our order because they said the cashier is not yet in. We waited and cashier arrived 11:18 am. Store should be ready on their posted business hours and employees should be punctual.</review>< pictures>

<Time>1459896006527</Time><text>Me and my daughter love the chicken bowl. It has the smoky grilled flavor that tastes so good. Beef bowls are not bad but not as flavorly as chicken. Steamed rice and vegetables tasted fresh. Food usually comes out really fast. Good choice if you don't feel like cooking and don't feel like pizza or hamburger kind of food.</text></record>

< Review>
I like chicken and brown rice bowl. It is really healthy. My kid(he is only three) loves to eat beef bowl with veggies. The restaurant is so clean and food is always fresh. I really recommend here. Food is so much better and different than others. The flame broiling of the meats makes a huge difference!  Plus they don't drown their food in that bad oil and too much sweet sauce</Review>

Chicken quality changed? It looked like the leftover chicken pieces that are found at a butcher. I saw it when they placed it raw on the grill.
I went there this week and ordered the usual: chicken bowl with veggies.
It appears that the chicken is not the same. Maybe the new owner changed the chicken distributor. All I know is that the chicken pieces were strung together with ligaments or tendons. It looked like one long piece of intestine strung together. It was not appealing and it did not have the same taste. I did not eat it comfortably. I will need to find another place.</review>

This place was horrible. I got a bowl that tasted nasty. I called and I was treated like I did something wrong. I told the so called manager what happens. She would not help me. I told her the dealership I work for goes here a lot. Didn't matter to her. I won't be going back and I will tell every one were I work to eat some were else.</Text>

Waba Grill is much better. Maybe it's this location because I remember Flame Broiler being better than this. The white rice tastes like minute rice, and Waba Grill's magic sauce is much better. This was hardly worth eating, but nothing "bad" just not "good". The place is clean.< /text>

The downside is that you can't rely on them being open as advertised, it took me three trips to pick then up because they closed as much as fortyfive minutes early. The service is mixed, one lady was courteous  and helpful, the other acts as though she wasn't there and didn't want to be there. It's a good place to go if you're not on a tight schedule and know what you want.<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

They told me to be back in one hour and my back would be ready. I asked them what time they close and they said 5 or 6 pm. I came back in an hour and half and the place is closed for lunch. This is horrible. I don't know any place that closes for lunch. If you do you should have clear sign and also have to mention it to your customers. I will never come back here.< /review>

This shop is a hit or miss with customer service, been here before and the first time was nice, 2nd time comes around and the lady was kinda rude. She already seemed upset but that's not my issue. Wont be coming here again. Id rather pay my taxes at Wal-Mart jajaja</text>

I bought a tool from this shop to remove my cranks. Went back the next day to tell the owner it did, and she told me there were no returns. No where in the store does it say they don't take returns. She agreed to take it back, in exchange of removing my cranks. After trying, I was told they didn't have the right tool, and they couldn't get it. But when they tried, they put a pretty big scratch in the frame. When I pointed it out, she said no, they didn't do that. Which is complete BS! My bike is new, and didn't have a single scratch when I took it to them. Customer service is horrible, and they wouldn't even take responsibility for the scratch.
I'll NEVER go back there again.< /Text>

It's kind of got a Sanford and Son feel. Like a bodega bike shop. Small new selection, huge used selection. The great thing is that it's a family business. If you broke a part on your bike then they can patch you up and get you back on the road. It kind of feels like a hybrid bike / pawn shop. It was perfect for what it was.</Text>

I recommend you not waist your time if you need your bike worked on. Bought a bike from them and they had the wrong thru axel for my bike and when i went back to get it fixed and changed they claimed they fixed it but in reality was not fixed. The thru axel needed to be longer and they left the same piece on my bike. This location needs a new bike repair guy. Seems like he has lost his passion.<//text>

<review>Best wheel truing service in the area. Im a road cyclist and go to those fancy bike shops from time to time but keep going back here to get my wheels trued. No drama, no bs, even if the rim is a little off theyll tell you and have a go at it and most of the time they can straighten it out or make it rideable. Ive paid triple for wheel truing services that take longer, give you the run around and at the end of the day dont true the wheels any better than this place. Hidden gem of a place for road cyclist or any cyclist who needs wheel trueing.</review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

Place is great; walk in, ask for whatever you're looking for, pay for whatever at a bargain price, get out. The world needs more places like this.</Review>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I do not recommend this place. Very bad service apart from not being friendly they are not honest. I do not return to give my business to them.

This place has horrible customer service beside their pricing. I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO YOU. One of the ladies is SUPER RUDE.

Their hours are not Covid updated. So you have to call them to find out their hours. I mean after 7 months of Covid, they still haven’t updated their hours?
Ok so they close at 6pm, I was there at 5:50pm and the employee at the door while telling me their open hours are till 6 and that it’s 5:50 at the time wouldn’t let me enter the store. Like you are telling me your store is open till 6, at least lie and say we are only open until 5:30 and then refuse me entry. I found it super unprofessional for a brand like this.</Review>

<text>Ridiculous. Hours aren’t updated online and we came at 3:47 when they are open until 4 and they wouldn’t let us in. You guys need to update your hours or let people in. This is the second time this has happened too. First we were standing in line from 3:30 to be told they wouldn’t let us in, and now the second.</text>< Pictures>

Had a really good experience in here and I just wanted to give a shout out to the team and a big thank you to Andy. I am not rich but I dropped a chunk of change in here earlier today. Andy got me three different options because they did not have the color I wanted in a certain shirt. The one she got me not only was a pretty color but it was also on sale. I really appreciated that. Also retail is tough it seems glamorous but I worked in retail and it can rough. Thanks for the good experience.<//review>

<userid>101502378122610984712<//userid><text>I went in to the store today to try on a multitude of items. I put the items I didn’t like over the door, and the sales associate, Marnie (I believe) told me not to put the clothing over the door as the marker from the door will mark up the clothes and stain them. (Please note that my mother was standing there, so Marnie made sure to be polite.) I felt this was a perfectly reasonable request, so I no longer put items over the door. She then said “oh, this shirts ruined. This is why we don’t put clothes over the door.” I left the dressing room and found more items to try on and when I returned to the fitting rooms without my mother, Marnie showed me a look of exasperation, and asked if I was going to try on more- to which I said yes. She reminded me once more not to put anything over the door. Then she proceeded to say “Because we already lost one white shirt.” (The shirt I tried on and put over the door). She outright blamed me for their lack of cleaning their doors. Instead of blaming your customers, clean your doors to prevent further damage. It is NOT my fault your doors are filthy and have marker residue. Thoroughly disgusted by the lack of professionalism and her eagerness to chastise me because I’m younger. I brought it up to my mother to which she mentioned to Marnie what was said to me. And Marnie rudely and outright denied chastising me and treating me like that.
If your doors are dirty enough to stain your clothes, perhaps it’s worth considering cleaning your doors rather than blaming the customer.</text>< Pictures>

Fantastic shopping experience at this store, clean and organized, staff is always helping us finding what we need.
The store is located in an open shopping center with plenty of parking spaces.<//text>

If someone buys a gift on sale and it doesn't fit, it's tough luck! Ridiculous! Their sizes could run smaller especially if you're bigger in the arms and chest area. Best to try on everything and don't buy a sale item as a gift.<//Text><Rating>3< /Rating>< time>

<review>As much as I like their product line and employees at other stores, I must express my strong disatisfaction with this store and the cashier that assisted me. Came up to the register to pay for 3 items, no one in line. As she started to help me, another person asked her a question and eventhough other employees were nearby, she told me to wait a moment while she began researching the item the other patron had inquired about. Once she got back to my transaction, I asked her if she had a $50 bill in the register, since I did not wanted to end up with a bunch of change. As I started to hand her the money I asked her if she would be so kind as to verify if she had the $50 bill, so i would know if to give her $300 or $310 for the $252 purchase. She said she would know if she had it once she open the drawer, but would or could not open the drawer until I gave her all the money...???? I handed her the $310 and she opened the drawer. She handed me a stack of change  and said thank you and started to walk away. I asked she had a $50 as I requested and she said that obviously she did not. I decided to overlooked her sarcasm and asked if during their training they been taught to count the money out when returning it to the client? She said she usually does but she did not this time and that usually she is not criticized on her performance... I told her that in consideration of my experience with her, criticism was in order, then I turned around and walked out of the store. I almost returned all items purchased, but as I said at the beginning.... love their product.</review><pics>None</pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Horrendous customer service. So far you guys have refused to assist in correcting a mistake that you guys have made. You store ordered the wrong color and you customer service refusing to help.

How hard is it to correct a MISTAKE YOU MADE IN A DESCENT HUMAN FASHION.

You supposedly are Elevating the world from mediocrity to greatness but your actually taking customer service and making it worse.

Carlsbad Lulumeon exudes incompetence as well dose Lululemon Customer service.< /Review>

<text>This store is great. The staff is wonderful, they ALWAYS answer the phone in the mornings when i cann for item lookups( which no other lulu stores pickup the phone ever!), and everytime i go there, about once a week, they greet me by name and say nice to see you again. Treated very well here unlike other stuck up lulu stores.<//text>< Pictures>

Many customers object to LLL price point versus other brands like Nike and Under Armour (which I switched both out for) but after purchasing a few pieces which outperformed AND looked better than the previous 2 brands... Why go backwards? It all boils down to preference. LLL fabric types, styling and discrete logo's are the most comfortable sportswear I've ever used. Even after a serious training routine, I was surprised that my LLL gear didn't get heavy with sweat. I constantly hear the SA's are indeed snooty and judgmental if you're not a Yogi (I've noticed), but it doesn't bother me. Beyond that, I've never had a quality issue. I've returned an item and they were eager to exchange it without a hassle. To stand behind your product is essential. It's been years now, so I guess I'm hooked on their gear.< /Text>

Good place for getting all of your electrical supplies in the South Bay.  Very knowledgeable and friendly with good prices.  Better alternative to Home Dept or Lowe's.</Text>

< Review>
Be very careful ordering from them - I received outlet covers that were completely different from the photos on the website. I suggested they update the website, and the first response was - well, we have a disclaimer on there. I advised them that now that they know the photo is wrong, it would be a good idea to update their site. I hope they do... But now I am stuck with an inferior product that I can "return by going to the website and following the return process."</Review>

Be careful!!! They are not reliable at all. They send refubished item as a brand new. There will be re-stocking fee in spite of not your fault. You should pay return shipping. They refunded about 25% from original price.
I lost $1,000.</Review>

Beware of this Co. I ordered an item on April 1st they took the payment and I waited until April 18 until a used item arrived. I sent 4 emails and one phone call about them selling me a used item and I never got a reply not call back or email. I started a dispute with Paypal and sent a message through Paypal and still nothing! no reply! nothing. Amazing, I don't know how whoever screwed me can sleep at night with a clear conscience.
Don't order anything unless yo must, and call to make sure your item is in stock and ready to ship. Oh make sure its not used!</Review>

I put in a pick up order during the lunch rush, ordered steak nachos, and my order was done early. Nacho's freshly made and stacked high enough to feed 3. They gave me several extra sides of salsa and although they didn't have my cherry coke in stock, they allowed me to pick from any other soda I wanted. Customer service was friendly and attentive. I will be back soon.< /review>

<review>I visit this special place from time to time since I love the special air that is unique to this place. The team is very attentive and experienced. The service is certainly efficient. Most important, the food you eat is magnificent. I have been there more than once and I was never disappointed. The payment is modest. I recommend this restaurant to to all.< /review>< pictures>

Really appreciate the effort of him and his team for exceeding my expectations of not only being immensely patience on explaining how the catering menu works, but also on helping me load my car. Such a positive experience, will not hesitate on returning.< /review>< pics>

<Rating>3<//Rating><Review>Service left a little to be desired. Cashier was on the phone when I came in. When she finally was done, she asked "can I help you?", then immediately turned around to call out someone else's order. If you're not going to help me, don't ask! It took several more minutes to get someone else to help me. Total wait time till my order was taken was about 7 minutes...with nobody else in line!!! And to add further insult, the tortilla chips that come with meal were chewy rather than crispy (not fully cooked). At least they got the "no veggie mix" part of my burrito order correct.<//Review>< Pics>

I never like burritos & had tried some from other popular chains, but not until I tried Baja Burrito from Baja Fresh. It was all meat, no bean & rice. Super Awesome 👍 Good service too.<//text>

I don’t know what happened to Baja Fresh it was the best place in the early 2001 and it seems like everyone gave up caring now. The food is cold every time I’ve gone.  I’ve given it 3 try’s the customer service average</Text>

Baja fresh always has good fast food, good service. This location was below average. The salsa bar was a little picked over and my burrito had a lot of rice in it but otherwise it was a good experience with the wait staff.< /review>

The food... is OK BUT: I had a Burrito that was not wrapped properly, resulting in the food pouring out of the opposite side as I was trying to eat.
I like to go to Baja Fresh occasionally, but this location is definitely off my list.</Review>< Pics>

<text>They have funny signs on the walls about love, women, and coffee. The sign that was my favorite was drink coffee do stupid things with more energy faster! Newhall itself is so beautiful just to go for a stroll. Cashier is very friendly and they even have quiddich candies and sushi candy packages as well as Marilyn Monroe bottles.< /text><time>1609898474737</time>< UserId.>

<text>Just went there today and the clerk was super helpful and really friendly. He had great knowledge about all of the sodas so if you are unsure about what to pick I’d recommend asking for a recommendation.

The staff there was super nice and helped me find what I was looking for! Super stoked to try this soda out and the taffy is delicious! Cotton Candy is my fave so far. (They also have Butterbeer for all you Harry Potter fans!)<//Review>

<review>I absolutely love this place!!! the owner is incredible and really nice to talk to, gave me really good advice on the best taffy and is delightfully still open. I have been coming here for ages and will never stop coming back, its low price and the guy is really down to earth and funny. Its always a privilege to come down to rocket fizz<//review>< user>

I used to love coming here before a movie to get some exclusive candy and be challenged to eat a scorpion and wash it down with some weird soda but now they moved from town center. This is too far out of the way now. It was more convenient located at the mall< /text>

Nice selection of candy and soda. Brought back a lot of childhood memories walking around the store. They even had a soda I haven't had since I was a teenager.<//Text>

Good and interesting selections. Both retro and new flavors of sugary treats available. Would like to see more ethnic variety. Nice place to window shop for candy. Cheaper than theater candy but pricier than other places.<//review>

Of course some of the candy is a little pricier than a name brand store but that's what you expect when a business is surviving just off of selling candy. Excellent selection and a very friendly guy working at the counter. Tons of retro candies I haven't seen in years here too along with the big brands plus the novelty stuff (1 foot sized gummy worm, ect). Really like this place. Highly recommend stopping by!< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Rocket fizz is a nice small candy and soda store with a antique feel. They have a huge variety of candy ranging from a huge selection of taffy to cotton candy to pop rocks and several international candies as well. The soda selection has several rare and interesting sodas along with the classics. There are also a few toys. The store is not very large but there is a huge selection for the size.< /review>

This candy store is awesome! I love how well decorated it is, and it feels like a classic candy shop. They have a great selection of candies, treats, and sodas. It's a nice stop before hitting the movie theater across the street as well.</Review>

Didn't blink,  so much to see. Big smile as I reminisced treats of my childhood, and discovered items new to me and my grandson.  I could spend a cool hour here just looking through everything.  It was all giggles and smiles until check out.  A middle aged male didn't bother to pause his personal call on his cell to say hello, seemed displeased that we were disrupting his call.  I thought perhaps it was bad news because I noticed him on his phone when we walked in being the only customers in the store at the time.  Based on his stoic face, I decided to give the poor guy a break, until he stated laughing like a school girl then returned to his previous flat face conversation.  I wish I spoke his native tongue so I could interrupt his conversation to say, HELLO I'M HAPPY YOU'RE NOT HAVING A BAD DAY. He continued to ignor us as he rang up items, only made eye contact to accept payment which was via debit card then he directed me by pointing out a chip reader. No bag offered for the multiple lil items purchased, no goodbye,  ZIP and my first and last visit was over.  Too bad as I would have happily made this a reward center for my grandson. Hope you all have better luck with customer service then we had.  Gave 4 stars because of the store concept would have given 5 stars for even bland customer service.< /review>

<Text>Neat looking candy store with rare to find candy selection, just don't touch anything you don't intend to buy. My little one made the mistake of touching a mask on display.  I was quickly reminded by someone behind the counter to read the posted "dont touch" sign. Not my place to shop.</Text>< Rate>

This is a every kids fantasy. It is filled head to toe with candy from way back when to now.  Parents watch out if you don't want your kids filled with sugar cracked. Haha. But kids it's a place for you to see and visit.<//Review>

As i was walking to my car parked in the security gaurded parking structure to leave this nastalgic candy shop drew me in with the fizz zaps abba zabba candy necklaces and a large selection of root beers, if one is a root beer connoisseur it is the man behind the counter. He was helpful and knowledgeble on all the root beers. I had so much fun learning and conversing with this gentleman. He knew his products and where they could be found and when the next shipment would be in without ever leaving his post behind the counter. He has ice cold sodas and candy and novelty items cream sodas although not as vast of selection as the rootbeer still if you stop in and i highly reccomend that you do  i am sure there is something from days past that will trigger a fond memory and or start up conversation with the man behind the counter. Good time.<//Text>

I always try to support small businesses, and this place is a gem in the middle of the valley. I absolutely love their red Ramen! Tastes so good with just the right kick. They have take out and sit in options, and the staff are always so nice</Text>

<text>Love this place. Been coming here for a while and it never ceases to amaze me. They're not cheap on the meat, noodles or broth (which is AMAZING).
For takeout they package the broth and noodles separately. Can order by phone, Postmates or in person.< /text>< Date>

<text>I love this place. Their bowls are great, and so is their ramen. My favorite thing to order is the DIY bowl and a roll of sushi. Dining-in is limited, but it's still cozy. The people there are friendly and nice. 10/10. I would be a regular if I could make it there before it they close every night.</text>< time>

<Text>Delicious ramen and poke. Super friendly staff. Don’t let google trick you into ordering from the copy cat enjoy in Northridge. Ordered the spicy chicken ramen from both places and this one is the winner hands down.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Stopped by en joy poke & bowl on the way to Trader Joe's since I love poke and I hadn't eaten lunch. The prices are comparable to Poke Bar (current go-to), but just -slightly- pricier ($9.99 for a small vs $9.50).<//text>

ramen is good, poke is good. however, when you order poke online it doesn't give you the full options as it does in person (ex. in person the menu says "up to 3 options" and online it says "pick one"<//Review>

<review>Very small establishment, but the ramen specifically is well worth the money you will spend there. They have inside seating and outside seating. The pork (chasu) is so juicy and flavorful, it's the best chasu in ramen that I've tasted in the area. The red ramen (what I ordered) isnt overly spicy and could be considered mild but its a massive serving and very tasty.

I also ordered the gyoza, and although the gyoza itself tasted decent (not the best) the sauce served with it didnt really taste good to me.

All in all, big serving, tasty and flavorful ramen with chasu is highly recommended, the only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the mildness of the ramen and the sauce served with the gyoza.< /review><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

Still more or less in shock at this find of a restaurant. If you blink, you would miss it walking by. Nothing in the area suggests that a top-tier ramen restaurant would be nestled in a strip mall. My coworkers and I got the poke and red ramen bowls. The broth here beats most locations in downtown LA. Portions are, in a word, large. The poke bowl offers vegetable noodles, which is a refreshing option for those looking to avoid carbs. Quick wait time and overall incredible experience.</Review>

Terrible Ramen. They go more for visual appeal and not for taste. But then again, take my review with a grain of salt. I personally could make better ramen but I know others who really enjoyed this place. I can't recommend this place but that doesn't mean you won't enjoy it. To me this place is a typical highly Korean influenced Ramen place with no creativity from the chef. I tried every ramen dish before I came to this conclusion so unless they change up the menu drastically, I will not return unfortunately.< /review>

Gross broth. Disgusting pork. There were literal chunks of fat floating on the broth, the kind that shows up when you freeze and reuse old broth. It breaks my heart to have to change my review. There's been a kind of steady decline for several months for what used to be my go to ramen shop in SFV. I think there's new management and they're either changing things to be cost effective or they don't know what they're doing. Everything about what made this place special is gone.  No bathroom inside.< /text>

Good ramen in the north ridge area. It is a cleaner tasting ramen, not as spicy as some places but the grilled shishito peppers add an interesting flavor.</Review>

Ordering was easy. Questions about the menu were promptly and clearly answered. I ordered the veggie ramen without corn. The soft tofu topping was cold while the broth was hot, the bok choy was in large, unwieldy pieces, and there was still corn. As a whole, the veggie dish lacked depth of flavor. The noodles were well cooked and the serving size was decent but I wish the dish had more flavor.< /review>

<text>Really good ramen. Little restaurant that you would think nothing of. Once you step inside, you order at the counter and then find a seat. Menu is small, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Poke bowls looks really good too. I had the black garlic ramen and my girlfriend had the hot ramen. Both were awesome. Chefs were nice and water is free with cucumber infusion. I really enjoyed this place and will definitely be returning whenever I am in the area!< /text>< Response>

<Text>Good food, bad experience. Came to this place, on food truck night. Three of us ordered food but one of us had a small snack size food from a Korean truck. I bought a build your own poke, a ramen and a pork belly with a side of rice. We asked for permission if we can have the outside food in. The cashier had let us eat it but we have to throw the trash out. We saw the sign which we missed initially. Anyway, my son was already eating halfway of his food when suddenly we noticed the cashier and an old guy at the back arguing. Then the guy told us no outside food and he pointed out the sign rudely. We complied to his rude request because we don't want them to mess with our food, but I was pissed. Poke and the ramen were good(maybe I was hungry). As we were finishing our purchased meal, there was a white couple that left before us and the staff said thank you to them. As we were going to leave, the staff and the guy never bothered to say thank you to us. They were Koreans and we're Filipino and Thai.  Remind you that there were no confrontation or arguments. We just felt like it's our obligation to eat there. I can go to a better poke bowl place with cheaper price than to eat at an over priced poke bowl and be treated like a none paying customer.</Text><user>113986476685992633577</user>< Pictures>

This place has the BEST Poke in LA. The fish is fresh for your bowl and flavor profile which bring something very exciting and refined to the mix.
My recommendation: signature bowl tuna or salmon with bamboo rice, crispy onions, chili oil, masago, edamame and avocado.<//Review>

I really wanted to like this place; but for $12.95, their bowls are just OK...
The noodles are quite thin; the veggie broth lacks punch and flavor; beef is lacking as a protein option for who is not into chicken or pork.</text>

I only come here because I had to do a ride along with a driver every couple of months. It's a big yard and you can get lost if you don't know what you are doing and are fairly new. Not much to say, it's just about moving freight</Text>

I have only been here a few times to pick up containers. today I was driving around for over 45 minutes looking for the roadability. nobody was helpful, they were rude and they ignored me.. finally somebody saw me driving up and down and they asked me what I was doing. I guess that is only way I was able to fix the flat from the container.. horrible experience never coming back</review>

Ok Trucking company, is mostly computerized so you dont have to deal with those arrogants employees, if you have any problems, ask for the managers, they are on top of the problems and will help right away, most of the mule operators are lazy and will avoid you when you ask for help and dont care leaving the containers where is almost dangerous for you to get under them to get them,  but you have to do it instead of waiting hours for help. To drop off a container is easy but to pick one up..good luck, specially if it is by the tracks.</Text>

<rating>3< /rating><text>It is tucked away and hidden behind an industrial area of La Mirada. It is located about 1 mile from the Santa Fe Springs Swap Meet and 1 mile from Neff Park. This is not like your typical railway museum but it's a nice spot to spend a few minutes of your time entertaining any child who finds trains to be exciting. I do not recommend pulling into the yard because it is a work site. However, you can pull into an adjacent parking lot that positions you safely and just right where your family can watch different rail cars pass. You will see freight and passenger cars pass through here every few minutes. Occasionally, you might see the coupling of train cars if your lucky. It is free which is great if your on a budget and looking for something to excite your kids.

After visiting this spot I recommend you visit Neff Park, which is about 1 mile away where your kids can run and play and still see and hear passing train cars from a distance.

I gave this a 3 star rating because it doesn't provide any hands on interaction for the kids but it's still a viable option depending on your family's preference.</text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

I was part of a group that enjoyed an evening  at Frank Sinatra’s estate hosted by a very talented Frank Sinatra impersonator. We had dinner on the lawn by the pool while the pianist played inside.   After dinner, we gathered in the living room.  Mr.  Sinatra entertained us with popular ballads. The home was lit up and inviting. Hosts shared details about each room and told stories about things that happened back in the day. The mid-century modern home made it feel like we stepped back in time to get a glimpse of what it may have been like going to a dinner party hosted by Frank Sinatra in his own home.  I highly recommend this venue and the group that hosted the event. They were attentive and welcoming.  Dinner was a bit over cooked but the atmosphere and ambience more than made up for the chewy steak and dry salmon.  It was a unique experience that I will never forget.</text>

If you remember the rat pack, Marylin Monroe, Elvis and others then your time here will be a delight.
There is much memorobelia and the pictures of the classic stars have them in locations that you also get to enjoy.
The grounds are very large, with two pools and many other amenities.
A worthwhile experience.<//Text>

<text>This was Frank Sinatra's old place. We were part of a group of people that had dinner there. It was very well taken care of. The original architect was E Stewart Williams and it was a timeless mid-century modern design.<//text><Response>None< /Response>< username>

Dr Alina Kagan has been my optometrist for the past three years and has been phenomenal!  I’m so glad I stumbled across her practice as it is located in the same complex as Blue Sky Cafe in Belmont.  Her professionalism coupled with her ultra friendly personality and attention to detail really resonated with me.  Lastly, I’m extremely selective when it comes to styles/brands and to my surprise, I’ve been able to find unique, quality brands that I’ve never heard of before (Frederic Beausoleil)!</review>

How often can you really say you enjoyed your eye exam? It was very pleasant spending time with Dr Kagan today. She does a thorough exam and also takes the time to give detailed explanations and answer any questions.
I also want to compliment Dr Kagan on her outstanding Covid precautions. As someone with a compromised immune system I really appreciate that she has been fully vaccinated, something that one can’t assume even with a healthcare provider, but also that she has decided to work alone during the pandemic in order to provide pristine safety for her patients. It’s just you and the doctor in the clinic, one patient at a time, not even a receptionist.
Getting your eye exam with Dr Kagan feels almost like a concierge service.</text>

<Review>Dr. Kagen is outstanding.  My examination was so through and she took time to explain the process and my results so that I really understood.  I honestly cannot remember doctor taking this kind of time with me before.
In terms of Covid safety, every precaution is taken and we were the only two people in in the office while I was there.  Finally...her assortment in frames is to die for!< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

I must give Alina Kahan and her staff five stars. The are cortious, and professional. Excellent informed and qualified to provides holistic, and meticulous diagnostic, and routine services. I loved the fact that this family business delivered my glasses before my sudden trip to Japan in March 2020. Driving in Japan was beautiful. Thank you .<//Review>

< Review>
We were so lucky to find Dr. Alina Kagan! She found a time slot for me last minute after my previous doctor misdiagnosed me right before important exams. She made sure that my diagnosis was correct and that I was happy with my glasses. Also, she spent a great deal of time dealing with the lenses company to give us the reimbursement we were owed by them.</Review>

Dr. Kagan is really great! She is knowledgeable, professional and patient. It was a bit hard to find the right prescription for me but she really took the time to explain things to me to and guided me in the exam. She also took precautions for COVID. I felt safe in her office during this uncertain time. Thank you Dr Kagan!!< /Text>

Got great glasses, big improvement over my old ones. The X-Fit progressive ones work very well for me.
Did like the ability to see a picture of my retina and walk through what is seen in there. Will be very helpful over time to compare and look for changes.< /Text>

I found Dr Kagan to be really, really helpful.  She did various tests until she found what appeared to be the problem, and then found something else that concerned her.  She took the time to set up an appointment for me with a specialists in San Mateo.  I found her to be very thorough and caring.

<review>My experience with the Family Eye Center was awesome! I had an exam at Kaiser but it wasn’t as comprehensive as I’d wanted so I sought out a local independent provider. I’m so glad I did!! The service is friendly and professional and their prices for exams, eye glasses and associated products are reasonable. A comfortable one stop shop! Try em!

My experiences with the Family Eye Center were great. I was there for annual check up as well as getting my latest prescription. Olga helped me set up my appointments efficiently. And Dr. Kagan performed careful and extensive examinations to inform me about my eyes' condition and gave me helpful recommendations. They are professional, approachable and the suite is very organized. I highly recommend their service!<//Text>

<review>I moved to Hayward which is far from this locations I still prefer to come here for my eye check up. Dr Kegan is very knowledgeable, and her eye check up is very thorough. Office is very clean and front staff is very friendly. Olga is also very knowledgeable and she try her best to fit you in for last minute appointment even in their busy schedule. Their contact lenses price are cheaper than costco. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone out there.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Thankful for my great experience! Dr. Kagan is really competent. She can do prescriptions, that you will be sure, your eyes are in safe. It’s important for every day life, especially, when you work with computer or need to work hard. Receptionist Olga is absolutely friendly and really knows her work sphere. It’s so important understand, how insurances work, which lenses they have and which a decision is the best for you.<//Text>

I came to Dr. Kagan because my other Optometrist had retired and I was experiencing a terrible eye infection. Dr. Kagan was very thorough in her examination and came up with a treatment plan to solve my eye infection. Within a day, her treatment plan reduced my infection and pain by 80%, I'm very appreciative of her care. Dr. Kagan and her assistant Olga are very pleasant and easy to talk to. If you need eye care, Family Eye Center is the one I would recommend.</Review>

My family and I actually had a good time getting our eyes checked out. Dr. Kagan is professional and very nice person. I felt very comfortable asking questions. Dr. Kagan is patient and explain everything in detail.

I want to mention also:
- Very kind and responsible receptionist
- Organized and clean office
- Great selection for frames & sunglasses<//Review>

Great service, great people. Alina spend as much time as you need to get the best result. By the way,  very rich variety of frames, different brands - from simple shaped to very cool ones. I feel very lucky to have such a good office close to my home. Thank you very much, guys.< /Text>

Wonderful place. Very smart optometrist as well as assistant. When you are selecting your new glasses you don't really know what to look for and what you need. But they really guide you through everything, making choices easy and fit to your needs. They also work with any insurance and do know very intricate details of coverages, etc.  Very delightful! Thank you!< /Text>

Great place for eye care! The doctor is super patient and goes extra further to answer your question and concerns. I first came in to treat my itchy and dry eyes. Got fixed! Then I did my annual exam there, got my contact lense fitting there and orderef my glasses, contact lenses and eye drops there. A family feeling from the center!</Text>

Dr, Alina Kagan and her extremely capable assistant Olga gave both my husband and I our annual eye exams.  Then they very smoothly sold us 4 pair of truly fashionable and hip eye glasses.  Olga is completely versed in our insurance coverage and told us what we could and could not do.  Alina and Olga have HIGH Fashion sense and I am thrilled with my Michael Kors sunglasses.  They can probably make me anything I want, like my favorite pair of sunglasses I bought in London that got stolen cause they were so RAD!  Why go anywhere else?  The process was so easy that we were in and out in an hour each for the exam and just picked up the glasses yesterday in time for the summer season<//Text>

My wife and I were looking for a new Optometrist in the San Carlos/Belmont, CA vicinity after living in this area over 30 years.  We couldn't be more pleased with Dr. Kagan's professionalism and her care for us as patients.  Dr. Kagan was meticulous in her eye exam.  And her office manager, Olga, was a delight in selecting frames and lenses.  We will be going back for regular visits.< /Review>

I’ve been to other places, and they just want your money and out the door.

I was a bit nervous about switching from an eye doctor I've worked with for such a long time. But as soon as I walked in I was greeted by Olga, which is by far the best at what she does she's easy to connect with and is great at helping you figure out what frames best fit you. With me particular I HATE glasses, but she actually made me reconsider the thought of wearing them and she helped me pick a fantastic frame. Guess what she also was able to get me my glasses and my contacts that I truly desired for such a great price like it was unbelievable I will definitely return she made it happen! Dr. Kagan, she was also amazing I loved how she really cared about how her patients were and were never pushy and she never made me feel uncomfortable since I'm super blind due to my strong astigmatism it can be comforting to know someone truly would like to help you be able to see clear again! I've recommended my partner to ditch his optomotry center and come straight here next year can't wait!< /text>

I was referred to Dr. Kagan by another professional in the eye care industry. I was extremely happy with the staff and the ease of setting up an appointment. Dr. Kagan was excellent and kept me informed about every aspect of the exam and what was being accomplished by the tests and pictures. I felt very comfortable and found my new optometrist.

Wow... I have been going to optometrist'a all my life and Family Eye Center is one of the very best. Dr. Kagan is very friendly, thorough in her work, and very knowledgeable. For the past 2 years, I have had no issues with my glasses and contact lenses. Also, I love the stock of Japanese brand frames she carries. Very cool and comfortable. I would recommend this place to all my friends and family.</Review>

Dr. Alina Kagan and her Superwoman assistant, Olga are consummate professionals. Both of them have gone out of their way in assisting me in finding amazing glasses. I have been wearing glasses only as an adult and I have never had so many people, including other eye professionals and strangers tell me how great my glasses look on me.  Additionally, the care that I have received from Dr. Kagan has been exceptional.  She is very thorough and takes the time to explain what she is doing and answer all questions. Dr. Kagan was also very effective in treating me for an eye issue. I feel extremely well cared for by Dr. Kagan and Olga. Olga is totally on top of what she does. Both are A+ in my book and I highly, highly recommend them.< /Text>

<text>Excellent.
I was always told I couldn't wear wrap around sunglasses, including Maui Jim's because of my astigmatism.Dr. Alina Kagan was able to find a solution, including working with Maui Jim. Alina also accommodated me after normal hours several times.
I am supper happy with my wraparound Maui Jim sunglasses as well as a pair of regular glasses. Just the best service!<//text><date>1481695192533<//date>< user_name>

<review>I have got my last 3 pair of glasses from Dr Kagan. My last visit resulted in both everyday glasses and sunglasses. I really appreciated the patience that she and her optician showed me while I tried to make a decision. Two pairs of glasses are not cheap, even with insurance! For both everyday glasses and sport glasses (mine are for cycling) I highly recommend Dr Kagan at Family Eye Center.< /review><user_name>Bob Indig</user_name>< Rate>

Does your work include lots of time starring at a computer screen?  Mine does and and I was experiencing random double vision, particularly while driving. And, after eye surgery several years ago, I was becoming very concerned about the overall health of my eyes.  Scheduling my appointment with Dr. Kagan was a Godsend. In a single appointment Dr. Kagan was able to scan my eyes, the optic nerve more precisely, and find that fortunately all is well. That was a big relief. She then completed her examination and a week later she provided me with glasses that completely corrected the double vision problem and work perfectly as reading glasses as well.  Oh, and she also worked with my insurance company and cut my expense by 50%. So I am officially a happy camper.</text>

<Text>This Thanksgiving, I'm grateful for Dr. Kagan. I was referred to her by an optician who said Dr. Kagan is the best refractionist--and she was right! I'm very hard to refract (I can't tolerate the optimal Rx), and I've had a hard time finding a new optometrist since mine retired a few years ago. I've wasted many hundreds of dollars on incorrect prescriptions and multiple exams with other doctors.

But, Dr. Kagan spent a lot of time ensuring that my Rx was perfect for me, and it was! I was so relieved that she gave me the perfect Rx, and now I have an optometrist I can trust.

Not only that, but Dr. Kagan is incredibly sweet, and so is her assistant. In fact, they ordered several different frames for me to try without having to purchase them (I did wind up buying one). Many offices will not order you frames to try, so I really appreciated.

I can't say enough great things about Dr. Kagan!</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>{'time': 1542927788358, 'text': 'Thank you so much for your great review.  We appreciate the feedback and we are glad you had an excellent experience.  Happy Thanksgiving!'}< /Resp>< GmapID>

<Review>The decor inside was really cool. The music was loud (maybe it was so that when it was really busy it would be backround music. But it was just us 2 and we couldn't hear each other speak.

They do take your card before you order and hold it the entire time.

I couldn't decide what to get so I eventually just decided on chicken tenders, so I wasn't expecting much. But the waitress said "ooh, good choice!" So that got my hopes up. They turned out to be the worst chicken tenders from a Mexican restaurant that I've ever had. So dry and pretty sure they were burned.

My husband's brunch meal looked good and was super big though.

If I ever come back, I'll go to the other restaurant by the beach.<//Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO_C5nlt1qv2ihMJuHMQM1QCAwMhOh883LWrVG_=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMerT--WggKKn2Oaufg1EtCrzxIP-K62b1ZBBVw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNuRLInbQfTUO-0m6YcOCyfBuBi4p-wImdN7ppt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOprWU-1cWDec1oMYF08RzHEMqrR6e69txJ8NeT=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures>< Resp>

I went here for dinner I found out it was just too much going on it was nice that they had the outside dining area but you had to take a picture of yourself before you go in and show your ID which was just a little bit too much then when we got there is a Mexican restaurants normally when you go to Mexican restaurants you get free chips and dip and salsa but they want to charge you for every little thing and the chips were stale and I think I paid like $5 for it and I'll just thought that was just a little bit too much for still chips and salsa then they ordered the chicken for I ordered the fajita plate and the fluffy is were good not a lot barely enough for one person they said they had guacamole cheese and sour cream on the side which is like a teaspoon and I asked them that they have guacamole with the meal they told me no but then I so I ordered more guacamole 10 bucks and I was like that's just too much when I got it they had guacamole on the plate yes a teaspoon but it was still guacamole on the plate and then it was just so much stress I didn't enjoy the dining experience at all and end up spending $80 on a meal that should have cost me $10 but I paid and I will never go back there again and thank you for the not good service<//Text>

Security guy at the gate of outdoor dining threatened to pop me in the mouth for not having a mask when I went to grab my bag at my table 2 feet away that had my mask. Unprofessional and completely inappropriate.< /Review>

I had the WORSE experience here on 5/5/2021. Our initial waiter was amazing, but it was time for him to clock out and and a new waitress “Heather” was supposed to take over our table. We already ordered our first drink and appetizer, however we were ready to order our actual meal. We waited for 30 mins (we watched her go to every table but ours). Eventually I got tired of waiting and went looking for the manger. I spoke to the manger “Guy” he was VERY nonchalant and had no urgency to help. About five minutes later Heather finally made her way to our table rolled her eyes and said are “you ready to order.”  We kindly said yes and mentioned we’ve been waiting for quite some time. She looked over and said give me a second THEN WALKED AWAY. Five more minutes pass and she finally takes our order by that time we were frustrated ordered a beer and asked to cash out. I’m extremely taken back by the carelessness of both the manger and our waitress. We were the only black people in that section within the hour of us waiting we watched other customers get seated , fed and taken care of without even a look our way. I’ve been to Cabo plenty of times and never have I felt so unseen and disrespected by the staff. I am disgusted!< /review>

<text>We came here for a birthday celebration. The food was pretty good. They have a 2 for 1 special during happy hour which was nice. The drinks on the rocks are better than the blended drinks. Overall we had a good experience and I would visit here again.</text>< gmap_id>

Good food, service was okay. You must give them your driver's license and your info stays in their database for 90 days. Security guards were there too.  Guess they usually have rough crowds. Don't bring your kids here, it's definitely not the right place for family dining.<//text>

It was great went on a Sunday it was crowed as heck. But the lines were moving pretty fast and the food came out fast...Nice customer service.  The only thing that I questioned was why did they need to hold my credit card.<//Review>

I arrived at Cabo around 11:15 pm received my drinks around 11:30/11:35 pm. Our waitress closed our tab 6 mins before 12am okay cool. Then a security guard comes up to my friends and I a min later asking if we closed our tab cause they close at midnight. None the less my drink was still full exactly at 12 they started kicking everyone out! I can’t even sit down and enjoy something I paid for? Highly doubt I’ll be coming back it used to be my favorite bar to kick back.</text><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

Management needs to take some customer service lessons ASAP. They do not even try to actively listen to customer concerns to come to at least a happy medium in an effort to keep customers happy and coming back.</Text>

This place has good food and drinks but be aware at checkout! Me and my friends were celebrating a birthday and decided to to come to this place and get drinks. We ordered a variety of things so we were a little drunk. We stayed til closing and by the time they had closed out tab. They had charged us multiple Wine bottles, we tried to complain but they just treated us like a bunch of drunks and told us they had already closed... We ended up being charged nearly 40% tip and include 2 wine bottles we never got and food items we never ordered.... They obviously scammed us. Keep in mind we went during their happy hour< /Text>

Great food and drinks. Went for cinco de mayo couldnt bring in the kids which I figured. They were awesome and offered to make us togo and hang by the beach. Would go again just without the kiddos for full experience.<//text>

Nice place to visit. Close to Venice beach, you can smell the ocean from there)
Food is OK, many options for drinks.
Toilet is unisex, I still can't get used to it though...

Always good. Famous for their bottomless hot fresh made garlic knot rolls. Nothing better than enjoying their delicious food sitting on the patio on a sunny California day.</text>

CT, the new guard performed very well and deserves to be hired on as well as a pay raise. AJ  handled a situation with uncooperative customers to the best of his abilities. Both Christopher and AJ handled the Situation as professional as possible and deserve a raise and respect to the max of whoever's authority<//Text>

<Review>First time at this location and it was great!! The warm weather definitely was appreciated considering how windy and cool it was outside. We went for happy hour (which is only two for one drinks). There are no food specials which kind of sucks because most other places do offer happy hour food specials. The drinks were good and service was great. It’s a nice spot and the people that come there are friendly as well. I would recommend this place.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c</Gmap_id><Time>1545973120477</Time>< userid>

the ultimate ice cream experience.

I rarely go for ice cream since it's on the less healthy side of food or desert choices. I regard it as a slow heart attack item.

Nevertheless, gotta go sometime.

Meaning, when in particular company, icecream is a nice added feature presenting cool social benefits.

I mean you can't not share a sample with your date or companion.

Anyway, the cold stone gimmick of mashing and mixing the icecream on the cold stone slab adds to the entertainment of the moment.

And the waffle layout in a dish makes for a total yum experience.

Even if it adds to clogging of arteries and a quicker route to six feet under.<//Text>

Yesterday 8/6/19 around noon my friend and I decided to come in and have lunch. My friend is Vegan so we asked the waitress (who I won’t name) if there were any Vegan options, she said that there was none exactly but they could work something up so she suggested grilled veggies taco. We asked questions regarding cross contamination because that is an actual thing. People who are Vegan cannot consume contaminated food because it makes them ill. (Same if a person was allergic) We even asked about the French fries and she was honest about it being fried with oil that has been used for other food but said the veggies are grilled with new oil and on their own so it should be okay and we went with her suggestion(Veggie grilled Tacos). Long story short my friend became ill developed a fever and stomach problems she got very sick after consuming these tacos. I’m just very disappointed and upset because this is down right disrespectful. You need to be aware that there are people who have restrictions to eat certain foods. There are people who like my friend are Vegan and there are people who could have allergies or do to religious beliefs cannot eat certain foods. This is not a joke! If you cannot provide what we or any other person needs, have some integrity!</Text>

What crooks. If you go there, fine, but make sure they don't steal your money.

My friends and I went for Happy Hour and split the bill at the end. Service was slow, but the people were nice. One of our group members closed out and paid for his tab. When we paid our bill, the bill wasn't itemized and we assumed all was good. The waitress gave us her card and said she was a comedian and said we should check her out. Fine. The next day, when we looked into what we paid to split the bill, it was more expensive than we thought so we called, they said not only did they not subtract our friends bill but also added nachos that we didn't order. We asked to be sent the bill via email along with what our friend paid, which they did. We replied we didn't order or consume the extra charges, but they refused to reimburse us for the extra $20+ charges because we had signed the unitemized receipt from the night before. What crooks. If you go there, fine, but make sure they don't steal your money.</text>

I gave one start because we were there for about 30 mins and although we spoke with the server, we never got severed. We even asked to another server, who although busy told us she'd get us someone to assist us. No one eventually showed up for more than 15 so we decided to leave. This is really poor service quality.< /text>

My cousin and I originally went for their Taco Tuesday. I mean all you can eat tacos for $7. Why not? We got there at about 8:50 pm waited at the bar to be served and no one paid attention to us until 9:16 pm. When we asked for the taco Tuesday special we were told it ended at 9. We were a little upset by that. But none the less we were hungry so the couple next to us ordered the nachos ( it looked scrumptious) . So we had an order of nachos with steak and their peach margarita with 4 shots to share for $19. The nachos were amazing. The steak juice and seasoned perfectly. Our bartender was hilarious. All in all a great night. I will be back!<//text>

Amazing place for huge margaritas and good music. I went with a few friends on the weekend and had a blast. They even have outdoor fireplaces on the roof so when it gets cold on the beach you can still drink outside. I suggest taking advantage of the taco and burrito specials because that’s what they’re good at. Also ordering one monster margarita should last you the whole meal.<//Review>

< review>
After a long Saturday on Venice Beach Boardwalk, we decided to take a short 12 min walk to Cabo Cantina for dinner. The walk was stunning! Glass houses to the left,  the sun setting on the beach to the right. Security checked our ID and we were on our own to find seating. All 3 levels were packed to capacity, which were a little discouraging, but we were able to squeeze two stool seats to the fire pit bar for a very beautiful scenic dinner setting. I had to go grab food menus from the back bar, and we waited about 10 mins before a waitress found us to take our order. The music was blaring some of our favorite 90’a jams, so the wait didn’t seem long. The wings that I once ordered at the Hollywood location weren’t on the menu, so I ordered the  chicken sunset rolls with a side of fries and Ari ordered the queso dip (with added shrimp). We shared a raspberry margarita. The sunset rolls melted in my mouth, um um good. The fries were fresh and hot thick wedged. Ari’s queso dip looked like mush and she said it turned her stomach. The margarita was “ok” in taste to me, but Ari said it tasted like medicine. I liked the loud environment, Ari said she didn’t like the people dancing so close to where we ate. 3.5 stars because booth parties should love the venue for 5 stars. I rounded up to 4 stars because I personally liked this place a lot to finish a fun Beach day.< /review>

The margaritas are awful! Not enough alcohol. You only taste the mixer. And the mixers are either too sweet or too sour. And I'm a sugar addict so I like sweet but this is not a good sweet. But their nachos are delicious! And they have a fun atmosphere.</Text>

100 Percent the ABSOLUTE WORST service I/we have ever had. And this is coming from two server's that understand what it's like to be weeded/behind. We were not greated and had to flag down three different waiters each time we wanted to Order, order another round, ask for our check. And then eventually physically get up, track down our alleged waitress, only to discover she didn't have our check. Then find the other "Waiter" that did. She gave us our check, without a pen to sign with. The ONLY time I've ever not tipped someone in my life.
I guess I know the reason they take your card before you order anything. Safe to say a walk out or two, or three, or four , or five, or a MILLION have happened before in the past.<//Text>

To start with 2 for 1 margaritas it's a great way to get the evening going. But it's not just the Margaritas that are two for one. It's any of the drinks. The bartender was efficient and friendly. I Never Had An Empty Glass. I had the Baja bowl and it was very good. I had their hot salsa. It was not as hot as I prefer but it was tasty.< /text>

This was our first time at this establishment 15 black professional and establishment individuals that was treat like trash!!! We were told on 3 occasions to stop singing and chanting by the host even though the other customers was enjoying out vibe and positive energy. On the 4th occasion this host told us we had to leave even though there was other white customers yalling enjoying the game. In all my years and restaurant going I have never experienced this! When we spoke to the manager he was clueless and did not even true to resolve the problem. This was the worse restaurant experience ever and a perfect example of racial profiling!!!</review>

<username>Wanda Dean< /username><Text>It's a cool place. I would say it's geared more towards college students or someone in their 20's. It's become a bit unsettling with pigeons flying around your head and walking around upstairs. I use to love sitting upstairs near the fire pit with my friends. Not so much any more. The food use to be really good.<//Text>< userid>

You barely get your money's worth with this food. I ordered shrimp tacos and all I got was 2 soft shells with a few pieces of shrimp a sprinkle of cabbage (which was supposedly coleslaw) and a little cup of sauce which just tasted like sriracha sauce and mayo. I suppose this place is only good for drinks not actual food.</Review>

<review>After a long Saturday on Venice Beach Boardwalk, we decided to take a short 12 min walk to Cabo Cantina for dinner. The walk was stunning! Glass houses to the left,  the sun setting on the beach to the right. Security checked our ID and we were on our own to find seating. All 3 levels were packed to capacity, which were a little discouraging, but we were able to squeeze two stool seats to the fire pit bar for a very beautiful scenic dinner setting. I had to go grab food menus from the back bar, and we waited about 10 mins before a waitress found us to take our order. The music was blaring some of our favorite 90’a jams, so the wait didn’t seem long. The wings that I once ordered at the Hollywood location weren’t on the menu, so I ordered the  chicken sunset rolls with a side of fries and Ari ordered the queso dip (with added shrimp). We shared a raspberry margarita. The sunset rolls melted in my mouth, um um good. The fries were fresh and hot thick wedged. Ari’s queso dip looked like mush and she said it turned her stomach. The margarita was “ok” in taste to me, but Ari said it tasted like medicine. I liked the loud environment, Ari said she didn’t like the people dancing so close to where we ate. 3.5 stars because booth parties should love the venue for 5 stars. I rounded up to 4 stars because I personally liked this place a lot to finish a fun Beach day.<//review>< Pics>

<Text>Was an okay experience at first until the end of the night when I tried to close my tab and the bartender continuously told me she gave my card back but didn’t. Proceeded to tell me she’d call and let me know about my card and never heard anything.

Check your bill carefully!!! They brag about their 1/2 off Happy Hour and then stiff you @ full price. They tried saying that $13.50 per margarita is the Happy Hour price lol. On what planet would a margarita cost $27.00! GET YOUR ETHICS IN CHECK! They did finally reduce my bill by 1/2</review>

Their margaritas are HUUUUGE. One plate and appetizer is enough for 2 people. If you're drinking a margarita there I suggest just sharing a plate. I always leave super full🤣. But the vibe in there is fun!<//review>

If you can snag a table on the deck upstairs, you get a really nice view of the beach. The last time I went was Sunday of Labor Day weekend. It wasn't overcrowded, so it was enjoyable. Prior to that, I had always gone at varying times on Saturday. In my Saturday experience, it is always too crowded, and I'm left standing in the way until my friends and I can swoop in on a table. The margaritas aren't bad, but coming from a margarita connoisseur, they are nothing to write home about. They do have a variety of fun flavors, though. And if size is your thing, this is your place.<//Review>< Pictures>

a bird relieved itself in my food on the upper floor, The waitress was nice, but the manager made her charge for the excrement covered anyways. The money wasn’t the problem, it was the ridiculous handling of the situation by the manager. Don’t go here, not worth it.<//Review>

<Rate>1</Rate><Text>PLEASE! Read your RECEIPT!!

This is coming from a customer who has been to this and MANY Cabo Cantina's and I believe they are trained to skim (not scam) the customers.

They literally take your order with a smile, then serve you whatever drink they want. OR They serve you what you order and add El DORADO to the bill. El Dorado is the premium drink that is $12.95 or $13.95 depending on how they decide to bill it (or their fancy keying or renaming it to another, cheaper drink). I ALWAYS order the TJ classic which is $7.95 and the most basic Jose Cuervo Margarita.

They will charge for the El Dorado (Patron tequila) margarita and say they made a mistake if you challenge it. Then, instead of changing that, they offer to remove a food item (for alcohol billing and for skimming purposes) instead of adjusting the real price of the drinks you ORDERED.  They will say the price difference (b/c its not listed on the menu) is only $1 or $2 but as you can see, its $5 or $6!

In the End, ALWAYS check your receipt.  Do NOT pay for drinks misattributed to your bill. And, do NOT let them take advantage of you, because as long as I have been going there, THEY WILL ALWAYS TRY!.

I have been going there for over 11 years, and Everytime, EVERY location, they try the same skim (scam) and everytime I catch them, call them out, and get my bill adjusted!

Do the SAME!</Text>< Pics>

We went during happy hour which was buy one get one free. I ordered a double boubon and coke and when i asked about the second was told it was not free. Even after the waiter has said it applied to all spirits and beers. We did not tip due to this. I was walking into the toulet and was confronted by waiter saying we did not tip he and tips were not included in the cheque. I said i know this and explained why. She then went and told every staff memeber and customer she could find that we were dirty and did not tip. Might i add after having to ask for the cheque she said if we did not write a tip they would automaticaly add 18%.we wrote $0.00</review>

They let my huge dogo in when it was really cold while we were waiting on a order to go. Even gave me a bowl for water. Love the upstairs balcony thing with the fire place and heaters! I'll come back even tho I feel that quality of the food dosnt match the prices. It's just a great place to hang for a min and grab a drink.<//Review>

The security guard was so nice to us. The place was good. The pineapple taste nasty. I wasn't going to say anything about it. However, I have a feeling that I should share the waitress about the nastiness of the drink. It tasted stale. I will go again. Hopefully I won't have to drink some bad to the taste.<//Text>

<rating>3</rating><Text>If you are looking for a place to drink next to the beach with less than ridiculous pricing, than this is a decent option. Well, pretty good considering it's one of only a few options.

Their margaritas are insanely sweet, even the classic. Also, please note that pricing on drinks can be a bit deceptive, especially during happy hour.

Food on the other hand is surprisingly good. Flavorful and in pretty generous portions, this is definitely not a good place for a diet but great with a beer or two.

Service is pretty unresponsive, so it isn't a great place if you're in a rush. But if you're afternoon or evening is relaxed, it's not a bad place to spend some time.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>Employees are sometimes more drunk than customers here. Music was loud at one point, bar tender couldn't hear me, so I leaned a bit over the bar. Immediately an employee who you can tell was under the influence yelled at me and my party. To not lean over the bar and other things that only someone who's had a few drinks would say. All tables are wobbly, so your huge overfilled margarita (yeah it will spill a tad bit). One restroom, not kept up, dirty. But then again this placed isn't so clean to start with. Bouncers are dummys too.<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Decent place at the beach. They only had Modelos in a can :(   I probably would've had more fun if I went with different company. I got there a bit late so I was just down for drinks but my date was more interested in stuffing his belly with tons of food. Mixed crowd, not too difficult to park, overall, decent.</review>

<text>this is my 2nd time going and I enjoyed myself BUT, my group and i felt as if the wait for our endless tacos was kind of long but the waitresses made that up to us and kept it coming. I love this location and love the vibe. the music NEEDS to get updated quickly. we were ready to dance and only about 5-8 songs were cool... we were there for about 3 1/2 hours soo the music should at least get some updated songs in there. but will come back. food is amazing!< /text>< pics>

Extremely racist! We came in with a group of college educated, professional people after a HBCU event and the manager immediately got concerned. He walked over to us as we were walking in and said, "we don't want any loud noise in here." "What?", I thought in my head. What insinuated that we were going to be loud? Outside of you judging the color of our skin. After all we are at a bar not a quiet, fancy restaurant. It was filled with white people talking loud, singing and having a good time. Yet as soon as we walked in we were asked or told not to be loud. We hadn't even taken our seats yet. As the time went on we were met with extremely poor service. The waitress took 15-20 mins before she ever arrived to our table, got our orders incorrect and demanded that we pay first. It's our policy she exclaimed. Not true by they way. Our food never came out and the manager kept walking by watching everything we were doing. One my friends heard something funny and busted out laughing and slapped the table in a big chuckle. The manager approached us and said we can't make noise or slap the table and asked us to leave. We willing complied because we were done with the rude treatment and politely asked for our credit cards back and a refund on the food we never received because we were still waiting on it to arrive. The manager said to an employee "they just don't want to pay for their food." How is that so when we paid in advance for the food? The food was never delivered to us (purposely). Seeing as though when we asking for a refund all of a sudden our food was being carried over to the table that we were asked to leave from. Because we are all very well paid, college graduated professionals we decided to leave the mistreatment, without a refund or the food. The whole situation was a display of their mistreatment and hatred for Black people. They displayed their racism and we did not let them provoke us. Attempt failed! We are too blessed to engage in racist mess. However, I  strongly hope that something is done so that this won't happen again. They should be shut down! It's 2019 people. Racism will not prevail.< /review>

This place has the best tacos I have tasted since I've been in LA the seafood was very fresh and the flavors were amazing in walking distance from the beach great for a lunch date with the girls, guys, or a family date the Margaritas were HUGE good thing I had someone to share it with. Definitely a place I would reccomend HIGHLY !< /text>

This restaurant blatantly discriminated against me!!! I was wearing a hat that night and the security guard who was checking IDs pointed to a No Hat sign and told me I have to take the hat off before entering and put it back in my car. (I couldn't put it in my bag because the guard said some people sneak and put it back on once they're inside.) I felt like this was a bit extreme but I went all the way to my car and put it away. Once I got back in line the same security guard was checking the ID of a man with a baseball cap on (exactly like mine!) and then he let the man in!!! So I was next in line and I expected the guard to give me some type of an explanation. He didn't. So I asked, "I thought we weren't able to wear baseball caps?" and the guard says "Oh...umm, yeah....So the manager has this thing where he lets certain people that he knows in with hats on..." I didn't stay to hear the rest of his obvious lie. I walked in and told my friends what happened and we all left and went to the Cabo Cantina in Santa Monica, and I must add that I was able to freely wear my baseball cap along with the 20 other people who felt like wearing a hat that night!

*Do not go to the Cabo Cantina in Marina Del Rey! Go to the one in Santa Monica, we had a great time :)</Text>

Of course they have Taco Tuesday all you can eat tacos for $6 something and happy hour 2 for 1 from 4pm-8pm.  Great spot to watch sports.  There is a parking lot at the end of the street, but it obviously fills up quickly as do most beach parking lots, street parking is there but tough to find.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><gmapID>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c< /gmapID>< rating>

I went here for a summer office party and had a good time.  The food is edible and the drinks are fine.  Nothing really standout.  It's fun to sit upstairs.  Location is this place's strongest asset.< /Text>

Get in, get messy and get it on. This is a great place for sloshing back cheap beers and tacos and eye balling the scantily-clad showgirls or muscled-up machos that have been strutting up and down the Venice Beach boardwalk all day. Cheap and cheerful is theme of the food, drink and stand-out patrons, and its a great place to start or end your night.< /review>

This place is awesome. The fish tacos were amazing, the bartender was fun and local and made great conversation To get a sense of Local resident flavor, I highly recommend sitting at the bar and chatting it up with the staff While you munch. if I lived anywhere near there I would go back every week. I'm already Jonsing for their street tacos.</Review>

I Would have rated lower if possible, sure this place is grate if you're know or perceived as a spender but otherwise don't bother, the service here will leave a taste in your mouth worst than the shocking, cheap tasting, pre-made cocktails. Biggest regret is being lured in by the b1g1f offer as they will do everything they can to forget there own offer and attempt to rip you off. If you're bold enough to question this even within there own printed terms you will be in for a show especially if you have the young lady who served me, after this display we paid and left swiftly to be chased on to the street where we were the educated in the American tip system and told that if we expect better service next time we should really consider tipping, well young lady this is where I wish to re-educate you.

Good service = tip

Not the other way round.

Up side this was the only bad experience I had saying near by, I recommend the Venus waler down the road,,, much nicer and they will deserve the tip</Text>

< Review>
Yesterday was my first time ever going to Cabo Cantina in Venice and out of a 1-10 scales 1 being unacceptable 10 being great it was a solid 3. That’s me just being generous. The overall establishment was filthy. Dust completely covered EVERYTHING. The signs, the televisions, the decorations that hung from the ceiling, completely covered with thick dust. I stayed despite the constant thoughts that a dust bunny may of fallen on me. Our waiter “Mico” had given us attitude right from the start. It was obvious her day had been messed up prior and we just got all of the aftermath. While taking our order she was not attentive at all. Since I was a first timer I had questions and she seemed very irritated when answering. Since it was happy hour the drinks were 2 for 1 (margaritas) and you could make it a double. Well after completely explaining to me what a double was when our drinks came to the table they were not made in a double but in two singles. And they were all made tasting more like flavored lemonades then actual margaritas. When we brought it to her attention she advised us that she put in the order one way BUT the bartender just did their own thing, then she said in a smart way, I can just pour the two drinks in one cup if you want. That’s defeats the purpose of it being a double Mico. It was supposed to be three doubles; 1 Peach, & 2 Strawberry Mangos total of 3 drinks. Instead we got 6 diluted drinks. We wanted 2 shots in on drink more potent, but no. Anyways when we ordered food, I asked for a steak and chicken nachos, jalapeños and sour cream on the side. My friend ordered a chicken quesadilla. When my order arrived not only was it covered in sour cream, but there was also a sour cream on the side as a side? As for my friend her quesadilla came, halfway cooked & without chicken. That’s when I wanted to speak to a manager. The manager was definitely a character himself, I wish I would have gotten his name. He went checked to see what we ordered and compared it to what we received, too many errors at one table. He said it was miscommunication, & that the staff may not of been giving our waiter enough support.. how is that our issue? He was sarcastic but it was obvious he didn’t want to be bothered with us either. He said and I quote “it’s not us (as in me and my friends) it’s just everybody wants a lime or something & I’m fat, out of shape & I don’t like stairs (because we were upstairs) & I don’t like any of these mother f**k***” like WOW. You’re the owner of an establishment, do you talk to everyone like this? If you talk about your staff like this.. I wonder what you say about paying customers!! We were all pretty appalled. He did eventually get things some What situated. After our in counter our waitress went great lengths to avoid us, we again had to find a manger just to get our bill so we could pay and leave. What a nightmare. My coworkers love this spot they even agreed this was their first time at this location and it was horrible. I don’t care if there are other locations, my time and hard earned cash won’t be spent there ever again.< /Review>

The staff is completely incompetent and rude at best. The manager lied to us saying that after a two hr wait and no food so the all you can eat tacos were no longer available. He would adjust a few items like drinks. Do Not Go Here!!!< /Text>< Date>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Text>This establishment is extremely unprofessional. I recently visited Cabo cantina and had a horrific experience! I was convinced by the server to order the large margarita. I ordered the margarita which was very thick and syrupy very unenjoyable. I asked the server if I could send it back and order something else and she told me she would have to get her manager. The manager Cody came out and with a very disrespectful tone and aggressive demeanor told me I will have to drink the margarita because  "it didn't appeared to be defective". I told him i simply didn't want it it was not enjoyable. He said it doesn't matter I have to pay for it. I should have known this place was shady when I looked at the menu and there were no prices. I had also ordered tacos which at that point i didn't want because I was so displeased with the service I was being given. His aggressive and forceful approach made me and my co worker want to leave. So I told him immediately to cancel my tacos before they came out. He said no I won't cancel anything you will be paying for those as well. All the while he was clearly on drugs sniffing and super amped and aggressive. I am a server at a nearby restaurant and was there for a co workers birthday and ended up leaving in tears. I have never in my life seen this type of behavior in any restaurant. I was forced to pay 35$ after not having had a single bite and only one sip of their disgusting margarita. He should be fired for his behavior or forced to lay off the drugs when working. Please do yourself a favor this place is all around horrible do go there.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response></record>

A sexist/feminist security guard by the name of Javier did not allow me to enter cabo cantina because I had a brown bandana around my head. Meanwhile a female walked out and back in with a black bandana around her head. I asked him whats up with that and he replied "she's a girl". So I told him "thats like me saying you're not a man cause u have a long ponytail on ya head bro". His manager was going to let me in but said my comment was argumentive. But by that time i didn't want any of their business anyways. I was just there to watch Moval Legend Kawhi get that ring for Toronto do you dig!!!</Review>

Perfect place to go when the night is getting old and you’re on low funds. Their margaritas are good  but also have the sweetest 2 for 1 deal. Happy hour starts @ 22:00< /Review>

Basically, if you're going for anything other than a margarita, you'll be disappointed. Wait staff actually talked down about other menu items and offerings. We even overheard them doing the same at other tables near ours not just to our group</Review>

The all you can eat tacos are alright. It's a beach cantina vibe. Laid back. Service is a bit slow but friendly.< /text>

<Review>Cabo cantina is great if you’re really hungry and want to share a big plate of nachos or nacho fries. Their margaritas are really big but a little pricey. They usually have good music and music videos plus the game to watch! I go here with my friends a lot and sometimes even make new friends here 🙂</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Went to this place on Monday. The wait staff was very friendly, the food was great. However, the drink prices were very high... Which we could have gotten over if it was disclosed in advance. $18.50 for a margarita was a bit unexpected and a slap in the face. Happy hour specials advertised all over the bar, buy one get one free happy hour on menu, it was happy hour time on a monday... full price, or double price was charged as the happy did not apply that day at owners discretion... SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED IN ADVANCE OR at least verbally mentioned upon order.< /Review>

This is the only place in The Square I won't go. It has it's crowd and that's fine,  but it's not for me. It smells like puke in the stairwell and the Delta Bravo content is high. The 2fer is nice at happy hour but I wouldn't go near the food.< /text>

Great happy hour just very small and tight bar. Not recommended for large groups. Much better for 1-4 adults. No parking lot. You have to park at the beach or fight for metered street parking. Has a rooftop patio which is nice if you don't get seated directly in the sun. Lots of tvs for watching sports. Food is ok moderately priced< /Text>

If I could give no stars I would. I have never had service this horrible. I opened a tab with the bartender, Paige, during happy hour but apparently when i went to close my tab, my card had magically disappeared, and Paige had ended her shift. A server told me to go down stairs and check if they had my card, even though I NEVER went down stairs but I  checked anyways.

Of course they did not have my card, then the manager came to talk to me to inform me that my tab was closed and was signed for, which was a shock for me. I asked to see the signed bill and the signature was obviously a different name and all the manager said was "I can't do anything, call your card company and cancel your card". The manager never took responsibility for the mistake nor apologized. Now I have to dispute the charges and get a new a card while the manager there has no care.< /text>

Place was absolutely disgusting, they take forever to order your food, margaritas aren’t even considered happy hour cause they are extremely expensive, 2 girls walk out the restroom and when I enter restroom there’s vomit all over the place, bartenders drunk behind the bar, waiter extremely rude literally telling us that the drinks were going to be like water and she replies with “I told you “ , this place isn’t family oriented don’t bring your kids, place is a disgrace don’t go here!</review>

<Review>Ok I've gotten nachos at a lot of places. But these guys, BY FAR, give you the most nachos for the price I've EVER SEEN. I split one order with my friend all the time and I feel sick AF after almost always because we eat to much. Litterilly you need 3-4 people per order. It's great.

Poor customer service. Rude waitress. Can't think of her name but she has long black hair. & she's rude as hell. I will NEVER go back there. & they tried to say a guy i was with was racist because he stated "i don't want that white shot" indicating he wanted a dark shot instead of a clear one. I guess that's considered racism? Manager and staff were unprofessional!!! Don't go here!</text>

<Text>This is the worst restaurant experience that I have ever had. The food took forever, and was served cold,so I asked to speak to the manager. He answered my complaint using a deflective strategy, stating "Everyone else seems to be OK." I retorted that his comment was irrelevant to the poor service I received, along with the tough meat and cold food.This manager was rude,condescending, and indifferent, and responded with a terrible tone and demeanor.The waitress was not trained properly,and didn't even bother to take my food order,but instead just kept walking by even though I had initially asked for a menu.Even when she brought my beverage, she just walked away. I called to her,and she didn't even bother to respond. Terrible experience, rude manager who rather than addressing the issues at hand, chose to be a rude JERK!!!</Text>< response>

Came here with a group of colleagues on a Wednesday night. The place was empty and the bartender was mediocre: enormous margaritas with mostly sweet syrup and little booze. Also we arrived about ten minutes before the "2-for-1" offer began but the bartender didn't budge on giving us the offer before time despite us bringing the place to life from a standstill start. I'm unlikely to return.</Text>

They don't honor the unlimited mimosas / bloody marys on "holiday weekends" even though the place was pretty empty. They also cut the unlimited hours on football sundays down, but don't post it.

The food was decent before they re-worked the menu. Now it's not worth the money.

And as a final kicker, my credit card info was stolen last time I left it for them to hold for the tab.

In search for a new brunch / football hangout place. Not going back.< /Review>

<Review>Didn’t have a good experience. Went to celebrate my brothers birthday and had a very agitated waitress by the name of Jadeon. She lacked patience and constantly got some of our orders wrong. Once we let her know the orders were a bit malfunctioned she had a very nasty attitude towards my sister. I already noticed she was agitated which is why i proceeded to say that you everytime she came to our table. She yelled at my sister and my sister yelled back, refused to serve us, and didn’t advise another waitress to assist us. Maybe Jadeon needs another job or needs to practice better customer service skills. Also the chicken tacos i ordered were very dry. I as well as my family did not appreciate her behavior not one bit. In continuance, there was no manager we could talk to regarding Jadeon’s behavior. We asked to see a manager and didn’t get another server nor manager. Jadeon needs an attitude check, luckily we were being patient with her because it could’ve went very bad for her.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Didn't try a Margo. They're all made with Jose Cuervo especial, which is alright, but I wouldn't drink too many. Tequila doesn't make you sick, Cuervo does. 2 for 1 drinks is a great deal in this hood. Chips and salsa were awesome.< /review>

<Response>None< /Response><Text>Terrible!  I have never experienced such rude, ridiculous and unprofessional behavior.  The manager/bartender Ray demanded the removal of the guy I was with because of a dispute over the quality of the drink he was given.  Really? If you're that sensitive about your drink making ability perhaps you should either improve your skills or just do something else.  As if that weren't enough of an insult he tried to add an intimidation factor (although no one was afraid of him) by standing over the guy as he was seated and being increasingly disrespectful until he (Ray) was asked to walk away.  Thankfully my friend was level headed and there was ONE staff member qualified to handle conflict as to not allow the situation to escalate.  There obviously needs to be more training for employees here.  I'm reluctant to add the race factor to the scenario, but if anyone else has had a similar experience please let someone know these things are going on here I can't see how it is being tolerated by ownership.  Very upsetting< /Text>< Pics>

<text>Worst customer experience ever! They brought everyones order out that i was with except for mine, waited 10 mins & no food so asked where it was they came back & said the order never got put in. By the time i got my food everyone else was done. Then took forever just to figure out how to ring us up. And still charged me for the wrong order. I will never ever go back to this place. The waitresses clearly have no clue what there doing!!!!!< /text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None<//response><gmap_id>0x80c2ba8e401b2d1d:0x924fbf79ef48be8c<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<text>For several years now I've been coming to this Cabo Cantina every so often. Mostly to watch sports and have some of their giant margaritas. I finally went to their Taco Tuesday and I was very impressed!

I've never liked their food much (I'm Mexican, I know what authentic Mexican food should taste like), but the margaritas are great along with other drinks. The decor and atmosphere is very fun and young. They have an upstairs and downstairs area, both with outside patios. Located right off the Venice Beach Boardwalk, it is the perfect location for "drinks on the beach" (you can't literally drink on the beach, unfortunately, but you catch my flow).

Taco Tuesday was great! I was worried about trying the tacos but once they were on the table I was excited to try them! Not disapointed at all; they were really delicious, at least the steak and chicken ones I had were. They had plenty of meat and came with a side of mexican rice and black beans. Paired up with a giant margarita, Taco Tuesday was perfect here! It was a full house for the Happy Hour which goes from 4pm-10pm, everyone enjoying a conversation over sports, food, and drinks.

Since it gets really busy, service isn't as quick but thats understandable. All the servers are very nice. I've never had a issue with customer service here. Parking sucks, but if you are lucky you might just get a meter right outside or there is also valet across the street and a parking lot at the end of the street.< /text>< Pictures>

You really can't miss Cabo Cantina when walking on the street here because of the crowd and the general rukus (popular here). I found Cabo to be true to my other Cabo experience in Pacific Beach (party town numero uno). If you like this type of energy then this will be your vehicle of happiness.

Surprisingly the overall ratings are only 3.5. My question is how can a place be this popular, crowded most of the time and get this low of a rating. Perhaps those that enjoy the vibe are not the type to do a review (ever think of that). Sometimes the most demonstrative visitor is someone that may have had an off experience. They almost always give the lowest 1 Star rating; when in general they should expect to have some attitude because of the mix of alcohol and average tolerance to the spirits.

< Review>
I barely write reviews because I dnt wanna take the time to talk about a place unless it really deserves it. I have never been to a place that treats you with such disrespect. This cabo cantina needs to take some pointers from the other locations like the one in West Hollywood.  I get it it's like the "Mexican style" bar and grill so you don't expect much. But you should at least be treated like a customer. First the blended Mega Margarita that I split with my friends was really icy. It taste like a slurpee from 7 11 that was really watered down. Way to much ice. I coulnt even taste the flavor I got let alone the alcohol. But I drank it anyway. Didn't bother to tell the server. We also got nachos which was great. Then I ordered buy one get one Margarita on ice which was really good. The problem didn't really come until we got the bill. The server (I dnt know her name but seems to be a dark hair white girl)  wrote 20% of 100 =$20 on the ticket. I'm a server my friends are servers so we felt really disrespected at the fact that she wrote it on the bill. Like we were going to do it anyway because we are of the industry but she didn't have to write it on the bill. We felt because we are a diverse group of minorities she had a need to write it on the bill. Some restaurants have the percentages PRINTED at the bottom for your convenience, but she flat out wrote it with her pen. When we asked her about it she brushed it off and said it was a bad habit. So then we start to wonder if this is policy so we called a manager( a seemingly white male named Guy )over. Before he came I saw her debrief him of what happen (which was really nothing). When he came he seem to already know what he was gonna say. When we asked him if it's policy he said yes because we have a lot of tourists come here. Then I said tourist are not you shouldn't try to force tip out of pple. Then he said its policy and its not going to change. And then said every cabo cantina is different.  I thought to myself yes every one is different, they aren't racist. The manager NAMED GUY was very rude. When I asked him for his name he said it was Guy and then he asked for mine and I said no. Which seem to really piss him off. It then Looked like he gestured to security to kick us out. They didn't get a chance to we were leaving anyway. My thing is you never know who you are going to get we were going to tip 20% anyway. Because of the manager we tipped her NOTHING. She wasnt a good server anyway. The team is only as good as the leader and the leader sucks. Not coming here again. I'll stick to what I know.< /Review>

I came here for Taco Tuesday and came with a party of 6. My friend was served a Margarita with a date rape roofie. Stay clear of this place. We were being served at a table and the only people who handled our food and drinks were the staff.< /Text>

< Review>
Went here Monday and saw Tuesday they had charged my card 4 times, totaling an amount of over $120. When I called and asked what happened, the guy told me that they charge everyones cards before they close their tab, then charge the real amount. Well, I got charged 4 times when I should have been charged just twice, the guy told me to wait a couple days and if it doesnt go back to the card to call again. Well its saturday and its still there! so for people who dont check theyre statements you should after coming to this place. My friends and coworkers are never coming here again and we work in a restaurant! I cant even imagine how many people are screwed over by this, they dont even tell you before they do it and hope you dont notice the extra money in their pocket. Thanks to them I missed a bill and now I owe even more money because they wouldnt transfer the money back in time.
THANKS CABO YOURE NOT WORTH IT. The Whaler next store is way cleaner and they dont charge you ILLEGAL charges, which they should at least tell you in advance!!< /Review>

I went last night. HORRIBLE experience. Never will I return to this cabo again. The waitress told me and my family that if we don't tip her she will stop serving us. That is what u call bad customer service. And the manager agreed with her. My husband told her don't charge the card I'll give cash and she looked at him ignored him and charged it to the card anyway. I believe her name was ellie rude worker.<//text>

First restaurant I have been in the whole world that took away my credit card before taking any order, thinking I will not pay after eating! Can't believe this is in the US, been all over Asia & Europe and nowhere I was told we need keep your credit card as a guarantee before serving you food!< /text>

Came tonight on a Tuesday with a few friends and seriously the security wouldn't let me in because I had on sweats. Wasn't even baggy or anything just nice and fit sweats and on all days i couldn't come in because ONLY on Tuesdays they won't allow it! Smh won't come ever even if it ain't the weekday!< /review>

Good environment. Drinks are decent, very sweet for the most part lots of juice not much liquor. Food is good, nothing out of the ordinary. Good Mexican food that will leave you full. Nachos and margaritas are my go to!
Beware of them double charging your card and staff for the most part isn’t friendly.</text>

(Translated by Google) They came to try nachos on purpose and were not mistaken. Loved the pleasant staff, delicious food. They took Pacifico beer better than the crown, nor so sweet, I advise.

(Translated by Google) to access the room, the security asks for an ID to see if you are of legal age.
You can sit where there is a seat, to order you have to give a credit card or money as a "deposit". Music a little too loud as there is already a lot of people buzzing.
Average cocktails in both quality and price.

(Original)
per accedere al locale la security chiede ID per vedere se si è maggiorenni.
Ci si può sedere dove si trova posto, per ordinare bisogna dare la carta di credito o dei soldi come "cauzione". Musica un po troppo alta dato che già c'è molto brusio della gente.
Cocktail nella media sia come qualità che come prezzo.</text>

(Translated by Google) Practically by the sea, amazing food, spectacular Margaritas and ... good company! ;-)
It is also a safe place, where bands and team caps are prohibited, so as to avoid fights.
Absolutely recommended!

(Original)
Praticamente in riva al mare, cibo strepitoso, Margarita spettacolari e... buona compagnia! ;-)
Inoltre è anche un posto sicuro, dove vietano bande e cappellini di squadre, così da evitare risse.
Assolutamente consigliato!< /review>

We decided to eat there as the price seemed reasonable, except for the drinks that were not on the menu. When he brings us the bill, we see that 2 beers cost us $ 14.50. And also the waitress, despite not being attentive and a bit pushy, tells us that we should leave a tip (18% of the amount of the ticket). We asked him if it was compulsory and he told us that if with all the nose, now we know that it is not. Terrible service (except for the guy) and price. DO NOT GO

Fuimos a comer mi pareja y yo y sólo sentarnos en la mesa, las cartas estaban pegadas de la suciedad que había en la misma. Decidimos comer allí ya que el precio parecía razonable, menos el de las bebidas que no aparecía en la carta. Cuando nos trae la cuenta, vemos que 2 cervezas nos costaron 14,50$. Y además la camarera a pesar de no ser atenta y un poco prepotente, nos dice que debemos de dejarle propina (18% del importe del ticket). Le preguntamos si era obligatorio y nos dijo que si con todo el morro, ahora sabemos que no lo es. Pésimo servicio (excepto por el chico)  y precio. NO VAYAS</Text>< resp>
