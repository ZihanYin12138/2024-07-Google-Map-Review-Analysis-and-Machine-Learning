<Rating>1<//Rating><review>Yes, I know, I got there 19 hours prior to my delivery. But being rude is unacceptable. The guys at the receiving on 03.17.2021 at around 2030 was just impatient and did not even want to talk. All he said was "your appointment is at xyz, and it's busy". Well, as I was pulling in, the three only trucks that were there were leaving. Within 10 minutes, it was empty. Yet, he still would not get me unloaded.
P.S. Street parkings. Also, the gate closes at 0100.</review>< Pictures>

This place is complicit in committing fraud with it's "members" or "customers". They blamed their system but one of their members somehow got my wife's debit card information. They are acting like no crime was committed because the transaction was approved but they have their clients name who they admitted was a man and didn't bat an eye that he was using card information in a woman's name that was from Cleveland, Ohio. He said he has the person's name and video of him using the "card" but not sure how he managed to present a physical card. The person we spoke to was rude and seemed to be on the side of the person who committed the crime rather than the person he helped victimize. They will soon be visited by the Oakland police department and hopefully everything will be resolved but just be aware that if you do business with this store you.arw doing business with criminals who will not shy away from taking the entire contents of your bank account.</review>< Name>

They don't follow appointment time. They have priority on certain loads, ignoring line and time when you checked in. 5 hours for 6 pallets, and they unloaded 3 trucks in front of me.<//review>

<review>Its a matter of luck you get your stuff ,mostly they out of stuff or nobody put on front for customer. we find delivery service for our restaurant from another vendor its little costly but  trying to avoid Jetro Oakland at any cost.

<Text>I found everything  I came for but lines are long all the time and cashier's did not have sense of urgency or should I say they don’t care about the customers. The company needs to come up with some sort of incentive or management needs to be on them to make sure they work a little faster< /Text></record></dataset><record>

Great place to go if you're a cook a chef for somebody that does catering like me but I hate that if you don't actually have a business or big company they don't want to let you just come in there and spend your money that I think it's not cool but other than that great spot<//Text>

Absolutely hate this place. It is a madhouse and they say they are understaffed, but it is just badly managed.
Try to call the manager and all they say is “sorry, we have to follow our processes”. It’s huge crowds and they won’t go open extra lines.
The manager won’t even leave his office when registers need to be opened.
Believe me, there is NO customer service.</Review>

<Text>Horrible Customer Service. Cashiers way too slow, talking with co workers and walking around in the middle of a transaction. One cashier seems like she is out of it every time I see her. I waited in line with two people ahead of me for almost two hours. I asked management to improve their customer service but they didn't care to even listen.<//Text>< Rate>

<Text>ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTING! I visited a friend who was staying there briefly, because it was the cheapest place to stay for the moment. Toilet was broken the whole time. Wreaks of cigarettes and other weird smells, and graffiti all over walls. Drug addicts everywhere....I'm surprised this place has not been shut down, or the health department called. It really doesn't even deserve the one star.</Text>< Pictures>

<text>Safest hotel in America due to the number of police incidents, security at it's finest. Biggest crime rate in all of North America. Asian owned faction style syndicate stuff.  FBI busts.DEA busts. General knockery and debauchery and drugs aplenty. Possibly the worst place to be period.< /text>< Pics>

<Review>This place is absolutely nasty there are cockroaches all over the place it reaks there do not stay here, I was constantly getting questions asking if I knew where they could score drugs. And it was very uncomfortable, and they don't clean the rooms nor change the sheets or pillowcases it's disgusting to say the least it doesn't even deserve one star!!!!</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
Heat dont work super cold plus blankets are super thin and pillows are extremely wore out. Under bed sheets has a bunch of old food crumbs and other yucky stuff and seen 1 dead bug of some kind..and no matress cover! Kitchen faucet drips. Bathroom sink clogged severely. Some type of bugs everywhere in room, bathroom and kitchen area as well can't quite make outwhat it is yet been to small, only been there 1 night so far. Leabing towards cockroaches but not positive yet... No towells. Windows from both the bathroom and room both have see through curtains so somebody could easily see you undressed. Bathroom floor cabinet and medicine cabinet definitely need to be sprayed down good and wiped clean as well as the floor in the rest of the room and the table and the kitchen counter and two shelfs above are just filthy. You could take one finger and barely swipe a spot and would have gunk and crumbs and dust covered from it. Oh and kitchen counter has a complete crack splitting apart probably about 8 inches starting from the edge of the sink going diagonal. Probably only holding up by a hair so cant put anything on it or could snap apart and create more problems<//Review>

Pupusas are very good. Authentic flavor. Quiet place, enjoyable for a family gathering. Waiting time, like any other pupusas place, between 15-20 mins.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) They don't rain with men because they will definitely have to sit and wait. The place is small, and they are in the middle of what I think is renovation. It looks dirty, they give BAD Service and the food is mediocre.

No lluegen con hombre porque difintivamente tendran que sentarse a esperar.  El lugar es pequeño, y se encuentran en medio de lo que yo pienso es renovacion.  Se mira sucio, dan MAL Servicio y lo comida es mediocre.< /review>< Pics>

(Translated by Google) Customer service is bad and slow. Don't recommend it at all.
If you want to wait an hour for two breakfasts and 4 pupusas this is your place.

<Review>Yes, this is a real Vons chain serving fried chicken, but for whatever reason the place seems like a forgotten child of the Vons family. The quality here just doesn't stack up to the Vons chicken around the bay area (I.e. big, moist, flavorful and sauced up chicken). The chicken is dry, the pieces are smaller, and they just haven't figured out the timing for how long to cook the chicken. Now it wasn't the worst fried chicken I've ever had, but doesn't live up to what I know Vons could be.

I came here for lunch as I was in the area so I couldn't resist getting my fix. They had a good variety of good value lunch menu options. I ordered the six wing combo which came with chicken, choice between cole slaw or pickled radish (I picked come slaw), and choice between French fries and rice (I picked fries). All this for nine bucks. Not bad! As for the flavors, you can only pick mild or spicy. If you want other flavors, it will cost you an extra dollar.

Oh yeah, they have a happy hour with cheaper beer as well from 3 to 7pm on weekdays). Oh yeah, like others noted, they have lunch specials, but they're made to order and the workers haven't figured out timing of cooking so it will take a while for you to get your food. Don't come here if you're in a rush for your lunch break.< /Review>< Gmap_id>

The best fried chicken in my opinion.  I recommend the crispy fried chicken (spicy)  with a side order of steamed rice and a beer.</review>

Always ordered here, and the food is great.  Cashier is very friendly, and it may not be the fastest service like other Korean Fried Chicken restaurant, but at least you see your food being prepared and you know its fresh.< /review>

<review>Decent Korean-style chicken bowls. I came here because the Korean BBQ next door was overcrowded one night. It was ok, but I’d still much rather get some real Korean BBQ. The Vons menu is quite small and the items are heavily fried or covered in mayo.< /review>< pics>

The chicken was a little chewy (possibly overcooked) but other than that the flavor of it was great, and it was a good sized portion for a lunch meal. The shop itself is tiny, so you might have to take it to go depending on what time you come here. The size of this place also makes it hard to move around, the flow isn't designed incredibly well (or there's just literally not enough space). The corn cheese was good, but a little too oily for me. Overall, I'm not sure I'd be back, I haven't had better Korean fried chicken in the area but I have in other places.<//review>< pictures>

<text>I will never return to this location. The chicken here was not cook well. If you ask for spicy they give you a sauce. The cole slaw had too much mayonnaise. Have to say I was disappointed. If you want some Vons Chicken go to the one in Milpitas or Sunnyvale.</text>< Rating>

<review>Worst Korean friend chicken ever. End of sentences. This place really needs to hone their skill to make chicken more crispy, flavorful, and just better. Couldn't really finish the Yangnyom chicken I ordered. Will never order food here.<//review>< Response>

Not recommended. Food was over fried and the flavor combos, in my opinion, did not work.<//Text>

<review>Long line, they took my money but didn't make my food as they "forgot", then in a hurry made the wrong food, and then lastly made it to dine in when the receipt clearly stated "take out." I didn't even get an apology though the cashier did appear embarrassed.

30-40 minutes to get my food in what is supposed to be quick.

Hmmm.  I was the only white guy there.
Coincidence?  Perhaps .<//review>< pics>

< Review>
I got a lunch special. It was suppose to be 2 wings and 2 legs. I got 1 wing (not a whole wing) and 3 legs. I was the only person there.  I did not like the flavors. That might be on me. Cole slaw, I didn't care for it either.< /Review>

Update: Giving this place 5 stars now as the wait times have drastically decreased in past few months....the staff is also quite efficient, friendly and polite.....Still the best place to go for a quick fix of Korean fried chicken....</review>

Some of the best craft supplies!! Plus I buy my Wella toner here, great price. I would say about 60% of stuff is actually a buck. The rest is more than that, but they sell higher end items most dollar stores don't.</Text>

<rating>1< /rating><Text>Not only is this place a rip off (overcharge for items you can get somewhere else), but the lady that works there has no business dealing with customers. Every time we go here and see her, she is complaining about how miserable her life is. And for some crazy reason, she likes taking it out on the customers. The guy that works there is nice, but that one lady is just difficult to deal with. I just wish I did not have to deal with her when visiting the store.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80c2eb4f98666d5b:0x5d63b227bc92f6ad<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

Current Google hours are wrong, closed for renovation and lack of outdoor space.

Interior vibe is awesome. Retro art deco/ classic train feel.</Text>

<Review>Lackluster dive that does book well when there's live music. DJ events, while some agreeably classic, could benefit from a refresh. Nixing the smokes alley, powdered soap and lax WC cleaning schedule all get my vote. And that tired smoking artist trope needs to go away. Can't be argued...the place is an institution. I'll always remember FITB nights. I'm aware no one cares.<//Review>< GmapID>

I like this place and have been to a couple of shows here. Good music, friendly bar tenders and great atmosphere. My only problem is that there is no real stage, so you see the performing bands at floor level, which makes it kinda awkward. They also have a disco ball that is on all the time, so if you are sensitive to this kind of these things. Great place overall.< /review>

Great happy hour on a good tap list ($4 pints), cool events and live music. It's only flaw is the pool table is too close to the walls, but it makes up for it with the bars other qualities.< /text>< pics>

This quirky little  bar is a great place to see shows. Their sound is surprisingly  good. Wide selection of beverages, and a nice separated smoking area.< /text>

Fun small place. Bartenders were nice and effective. I was there with friends for Bobby and the Pins. Interesting band. I would recommend this to people okay with a loud smaller venue.<//Review>

<Text>Whistle Stop is an interesting watering hole, which bills itself as a neighborhood bar with funky events. I was there a couple of hours, specifically for the So Say We All evening performances of personal storytelling. The place seems cozy and friendly. When I'm in that area again, I'll go back.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Great dive bar in South Park. I went for a comedy night which they apparently have relatively frequently, it was packed and the comics were great overall. Friendly, casual, neighborhood vibe, solid place to grab an affordable beer or two and enjoy a music or comedy show or a game night!<//Text>

<Review>They dont verbally tell you that its cash only.

Edit: They are no longer cash only! I feel like my review actually changed their mind. Maybe  it wasn't me, but either way I am so glad they changed their cash only policy.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<text>If you like dive bars and down to earth, nice people this is the place to be. If your idea of going dancing involves stilettos or bottle service you will probably not like this place.
Bar is cash only. The staff is attentive and helpful,and I've never felt unsafe here.
Perfectly mixed drinks, and good selection on tap.
Entertainment varies widely, including live music. Generally excellent place.</text>< pictures>

< review>
The gendered bathroom signs gotta go, tho. I imagine a world where we can all pee/poop in whichever bathroom we want.

Went to Love Affair tonight - Which was amazing and should happen more often! - but got policed by someone for what she perceived me to be in "the wrong bathroom". These kinds of things can be avoided if ya just put up signs that simply say "Bathroom."

Hopefully management sees this review and something changes!</review>

< Review>
This is a very cool, down to earth place to stop by.   The recurrent experience that you can expect is attentive and genuine service from behind the bar, along with a soundscape consisting of a great jukebox or interesting  live music.

There are many types of evening musical performances, there is a monthly calendar posted so have a look.

Happy hours are seldom crowded. Beer and well specials are reasonably priced.

The bar is dog friendly, but not set up specifically for dog owners.  Most of the time, it's just someone stopping by while out for a walk with their dog.  I've never experienced an inconsiderate dog owner here.

No food except for snacks, lots of options within 100 feet.</Review>

This is one of my favorite bars in this part of town. They host lots of different events, and they’re all awesome. I recommend visiting their website, checking out upcoming events, and choosing something that suits you. The sketch parties are fun. Sometimes there are spoken word / storytelling events, comedy, reader’s theater... but my favorite reason to go to the Whistle Stop is 80s versus 90s night. Two Saturdays a month, for a $5 cover, you can dance your face off and drink cheap drinks, without the Gaslamp pretension.< /Text>

< review>
An unpretentious community gathering place that hosts musicians, writers, artists, DJs and more. This is a cash-only bar with a decent array of a few wines, about a dozen beers on tap with more in bottles, along with an array of spirits/mixed drinks. Side alley behind the bar for the smoking set. Highly recommend attending The VAMP, a monthly storytelling gathering that comes with a theme. Starts at 7:30pm but get there early on the last Thursday of the month to get a seat.< /review>

< Review>
21+ Cash Only Bar. We visited on a night hosting a comedy show. Arrived an hour early for Happy Hour Draught Beers and to claim a table for the show. Great comedian line-up. We would definitely come back again.
Two room Bar with a cutout window wall separating the space. We only drank draught beer and enjoyed their tap list.  ATM on site. Separate men's and woman's restroom.
Nice neighborhood bar.<//Review>

<Text>My friend's favorite bar to hit when he's in town. Seems like a cool place, but I have yet to be there when it is busy. Beer selection is awesome. Has been cash only for the number of times I've been there. Also there is no food available (they have a few small snacks for sales like chips).</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Resp>

Music's good and there always a crowd, but I hate that they only take cash... Cover can get up to $10 which is kinda pricey for a local bar. I prefer bluefoot, but I get the appeal.<//Review>

Not really my scene here, but playing pool every so often in a dark bar sometimes is just what I need in my life. Pool is 50 cents and drinks are moderately priced. Sometimes they have interesting shows and they get really busy. The bartenders are super nice and accommodating, and the whole place just seems best when there are fewer patrons.</review>

<review>Out for the night trying to enjoy a fun evening when we were verbally attacked by a security officer for moving a stool. He aggressively approached us with an attitude and threatened to kick us out. It didn't help that he was using extreme hand gestures way too close to my face. He ended up kicking us out since he is a security guard who is on a power trip! We ended up speaking to Lonnie at the door with the issue but it felt like it fell upon deaf ears. . To be honest that power trip security guard did us a favor by kicking us out! The ambiance inside whistle stop was gross and seemed as though it was beyond capacity</review>< Pictures>

Whistle Stop is a kind of bar with a local neighborhood feel. They have a full bar and an awesome selection of craft beers. Bartenders are very friendly. Live entertainment and DJs are frequently featured with lower than average cover charge, if any.</text>

<Text>Drinks are crazy expensive for what is. Better environment than a dive bar, but not really upscale either. they occasionally have some cool events here, film festival showings and kitschy bands and the like.</Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Gmap_id>0x80d95486fc9382ab:0x26ab8a9f27666db8</Gmap_id><user_name>Mason Zedaker</user_name></record></dataset><record>

Always dope scene. Occasional douchey white folks and way too handsy cismen but, not the fault of the bar or staff. And if addressed they WILL take care of the offender. Better DJ's than gossip grill.< /text>

In saying that, Booty Basement is extreamly popular, I recommend getting there by 9pm at the latest. Be sure to have cash for both the cover and the bar. They play a great selection of old school hip hop. Be sure to dress apropriately as it gets really "hot in here." Raver rain starts dripping from the ceiling usually around midnight.< /Text><Rating>4<//Rating><username>Judi Waddell</username></record></dataset><record>

If I could rate less I would this place is terrible we waited for hours for the band we came to see to go on the bar said all shows start at 9 waited till 11 then left heard the band talking amongst themselves outside their contract won't allow them to go on till 12 this is rediculoilus. People show up at 9 expecting a show buy drinks and get sick of waiting then leave. And if you think oh I'll just show up at 11 you might have to wait for an hour to even get in due to small bar is full.</Text>

<review>Don't EVEN BOTHER going to this quest location if you don't have an appointment you will be waiting for hours outside in the heat. Thanks to covid you're not allowed to wait in the waiting room it's not an issue of their friendliness it's just an issue of how fast they can pump out blood in urinalysis. I left there after an hour's wait and went to the one in Moreno valley the next day and I was in and out in 10 minutes blood and urine test done we'll do a separate review for them however I would never ever recommend this location ever!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1618344404702, 'text': 'We apologize if this was your experience, Kelly, and thank you for bringing this to our attention.

<Review>I do not recommend anyone going to this location. Fadia, the front office lady makes everyone wait 1 hr- 2 hrs. She has the worst attitude and no compassion to any elderly people. She will only except people appointment however although the location allows walk in. I have never experience a more angry, rude, employee with absolutely no customer service experience. Every person there was extremely angry at her< /Review>< Pics>

I stopped by this office during my lunch time to get a blood test taken.   My Doctor had already put in a request in the system.   I sat for over an hour and other people who were there before me were also still waiting.   The office was not crowded.   Myself and the person after me had to leave, we both had other places to be.   I thought that this would be reasonably fast, I guess not.<//review>

< Review>
This is by far one of Quest's best kept secrets! Sssssh Very clean location with an exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable staff (never even leaving a mark after having blood drawn). Have been there a half a dozen times, at best and never had to wait, nor had a negative issue. Had to laugh, to read another's rating of this office, as apparently they either got up on the wrong side of the bed, didn't have the correct paperwork/valid insurance, or possibly got their locations confused. They definitely didn't describe THIS office!lol  Thank you Taylor and Cindy for your always professional service with a smile. My favorite new office. The rest of you can go elsewhere, cuz this place is a secret...with no wait time :)</Review>

< Review>
I brought my mom here for labs and my mom is a person who is very sweet she has cancer stage 4. She came to the receptionist desk where a young black lady to be specific was working that day. My mom asked her excuse me I don't know if I'm at the right place and handed her the lab paper work her doctor gave her then she looked at my mom and said what with an attitude what are you saying? Then she said in a very ignorant way yeah your at the right place and gave my mom a dirty look and rolled her eyes at her and told her give me your insurance card and have a seat. Horrible customer service obviously this girl should not be working here with her bad attitude she is working in the wrong work place then I also say here and watched her and she was rude to other people as well and gave then dirty looks so who ever hired her is obviously drunk because they must be desperate for help.< /Review>

<Text>I am absolutely appalled with the attitude of the young African American girl and the older Hispanic lady with short blond hair, working at the reception desk.

I have been a customer service supervisor for over 20 years and if one of my team members treated people the way they do, they would be reprimanded in a heart beat.

I sat and watched the AA (african american) girl be absolutely rude and condescending to EVERY patient that she assisted. Her body language and tone of voice told me she thought she was superior to everyone else.

Look here missy, the clinic's demographic is minority based. YOU YOURSELF are black. You hold NO superiority to ANYONE else. And if you thought your financial status put you above and beyond everyone else, you wouldn't be working at Quest.

Her tone was continuously aloof and bothered. She acted as if she was doing the patients a favor. I could not believe the way she treated these people.

This Quest is very close to my residence and on my way to work. I will go OUT OF MY WAY to NEVER come here again if I can help it.

The older Hispanic lady was no better. I had come in the day before to have blood work done and she did not greet me with even eye contact.

"Fill your name in, on the clip board" No "Have a seat, and we'll be right with you." or any other type of instruction. I have NEVER seen reception like this ever.

I hope the office manager or the owner sees this and makes the necessary adjustments.

This completely ruined my morning.

People like this DO NOT belong in customer service.<//Text>< user_name>

<review>Office was clean staff was nice.. went in for blood draw. Hurt a little bit more than usual and was sore. Got home had a lump the size of a marble and huge bluish purple bruise 4 days later. Never had this happen so I'm guessing the tech was sloppy. I won't be back<//review></record>

I just called to make an appointment. The recording which is compuerized which asks questions and answers you back.
Well she the computer told me their were no open appointment dates available only until August 9th,2016
Which they Quest states that they are closed on the weekend which Aug.9th,2016 is on a Saturday. Then asked me which day/date
Would I like, Obviously the next open work day/date which would be. Aug.11th,2016
Therefore it seems N looks obvious that the coputerized machine was or has the month wrong. Because i'm looking at my calendar and it was trying to give me a appointment date for July,2016.
They need to fix their computer/machine so when people do call to make an appointment they will be able to make it on the RIGHT
TIME AND DATE...
Very irritating N annoying. So now I have to wait until Monday to make an appointment.
If not just go and be a walk in...
Thanks for nothing Quest Diagnostic in Anaheim on Ball Rd and Brookhurst...😟</text>

< review>
The worst service,   lady at front counter was rude to other patients,  she offered no one to translate,   the patient arrived in a taxi and taxi left,   she was disabled and so was her mother and son,  for being in medical field no consideration.   I was disgusted and walked out before  I would of said something I could not take back.....< /review>

First time going here and had an awesome experience! I made an appointment and they helped me on time, which I find is not common with most nail salons. I showed Ty or Tai (not sure of the spelling) what I wanted and he replicated it exactly! He was also very gentle and polite throughout. I will diffidently be going back.</Text>

Called in the morning & got an appointment for the same afternoon even though nail salons are super busy right now. They took my temperature first thing, and asked me to use hand sanitizer before i touched anything else. I was surprised to see that i was the only person with an appointment for that time-not sure if this was intentionally in cooperation  with social distancing or just a coincidence. The guy who did my nails asked me how I wanted them to look rather than just making them turn out like all the other full sets he'd ever done. In previous experiences, at other places, I've tried to explain how I want my nails done only to find that there is a huge language barrier that makes it impossible for us to communicate with one another, but today I was able to relax & feel confident that the young man working on my nails understood everything I said. This really did have a lot to do with my choice to give The Nail Bar a positive review. I was outside & back at work in 45 minutes which my client appreciated very much also. While I'm not quite sure yet if I am stoked on how they came out in the end, I have concluded that the fault for any part of the finished result lies entirely on me & the length I requested combined with the shape I thought I wanted-I will be changing that in the future. I definitely recommend you at least give this place a try & see if it fits your style. Nothing works for everyone & everyone has their own way they like things to be done & unless you try it you'll never know. I, for one, am super happy I finally checked it out! I'll definitely be going back! Oh! And they're very reasonably priced as well!</text>

I made an appointment to get my acrylic nails taken off. The lady working with my nails was ripping them off without any soak, just taking a new acrylic nail and prying off my acrylics. I asked if I could get them soaked with foil; she refused and said it would take too long. I am assuming it’s because the salon was busy and they wanted to get as many customers in and out as possible. I’m disappointed though, because I was expecting to be there for a bit to get my nails painlessly removed but just got them ripped off which I could have done at home.

I came here once before for a set of acrylics. It was a good set and they lasted a while, but almost all of my cuticles were cut so that they were open and raw. This isn’t completely uncommon in my experience but my problem came when about 5 of them became swollen and infected the same day. It goes away in a few days with rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide a few times a day. This is a lot of work though that could be avoided by just going to a clean salon.< /Review>

This is my favorite nail salon in Humboldt County. The interior is always clean and feels like a brand new salon when many salons in Humboldt are in old dilapidated buildings. My gel nails always come out perfect. High quality polish is used and the manicures last!!< /Text>

< review>
I went to get my nails done here with a family member a bit younger than I am and they clearly took advantage of our youth. Not only did they try to charge us for gel when we asked for a regular appointment, but they told us to not come back when we asked for a reimbursement. On top of this, the acrylics were very sloppy and chipped in the first week. The gel also got underneath our nails which was uncomfortable as well as looking very unclean.< /review>

< Review>
I was over charged and then when I called to inquire about it, a woman rudely told me “you probably just can’t hear”. After further discussion SHE told me to come in and they would give me back the 30 dollars.

I was met with unprofessional and belittling conversation from one of the men who works there. He was yelling at me in front of quite a few clients and made a comment about how he’s been in business for a long time and has never refunded anyone ever and told me to not come back there. I wasn’t going to write a review, I rarely ever write reviews. However, after this incident I waited two days and decided to write it because of this experience and how my manicure turned out.

One nail chipped the day after, another started lifting two days after, and all my cuticles are peeling, raw, some bleeding, and all hurt. My cuticles have never been like this with or without manicures until going to the Nail Bar.<//Review>

Mai was efficient, professional, friendly, and did a perfect job on my nails. This is the third place in the area I have tried, the other two did not adhere to state board standards, took a very long time, and did extraordinarily poor. I’ve been a licensed cosmetologist my entire adult life, many of those in management, thus understand all aspects of the salon and services. I  I am also not extraordinarily choosy and I am so happy to finally find somebody qualified in the area.< /Text>

The place is very clean, and bright. The staff were very friendly. They paid pretty good attention to our feet. I would have liked a little more exfoliating however the woman working on me was really nice and painted my feet and nails beautifully. They used nice oils, good smelling soap, and sterilized equipment. My nail polish on my hands chipped within a few days but that's my fault for not spending a little extra for gel. I will definitely be coming back and definitely telling everyone to go to the nail bar.< /Text><gmapID>0x54d15aed0cd7e021:0x8015014d983dd94a</gmapID><Rate>4<//Rate>< Resp>

<rating>2<//rating><review>Went to the Nair Bar 2 months prior to travel because it was closer to my home, to see how well there pedicure held up,  but before the first week was up the polish started disappearing from my nails. This has not happened to me before and I have had many pedicures in the past. I figured something must have gone wrong and went in to talk to the owner to see what it possibly could have been. He told me pedicure polish only lasts 2-3 week, but that had not been the case before for me it always just grew out. So unfortunately I will not be back.
Sorry to say because it was very conveniently located...oh well best laid plans and all that</review><Time>1563151528370</Time></record></dataset><record>

<user>117311685314063779961<//user><review>Cut my nails down to the quick on several to remove an acrylic set instead of soaking them like I asked to keep my length. Then argued I was wrong , finished my manicure as basic as you can possibly imagine. Nails all different lengths and polish not covering whole nails.

The worst experience of my life! That's saying a lot from someone who's been getting her nails done for probably way too many years...

I really enjoyed the atmosphere here! The staff are friendly and there's a lot of space and natural light. I got a pedicure for my birthday and for $30 I got to sit in the massage chair while my feet were pampered for over an hour. They also provide a very generous pour of complimentary champagne (or mimosa or wine or coffee); you only have to ask, they don't immediately offer it. We had scheduled an appointment, though it was clear upon arrival that wasn't actually necessary. I would definitely go back.</text>

The place is beautiful and the people are friendly. From what I read on their website they claim to give complimentary drinks but I wasn't even offered water.  I was expecting to have had an actual manicure done as well like cuticles and what not but that was not the case. I did really like how my nails turned out though but was disappointed when I had to ask ask for cuticle oil & didn't get a hand massage which is something every other place I've been to in the past does. If you're looking for quick and good nails without the pampering I would still recommend.<//Review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Worst nail experience ever. I came to the nail bar because I'm new to the area looking for a new nail salon. Well first of all, the man who did my nails didn't communicate with his words, when he wanted me move my hard or relax my hand he just jabbed my hand with his middle finger. Second of all, he kept digging his sharp thumb nail under my nails! I said "ouch" at least 4 times, he didn't seem to get the hint. Third, almost all of my fingers are bleeding from him sanding my nails and sanding my actual skin off! 4th, he kept swatting at my hand to wipe off the nail dust..  like there was a fly on my hand or something! And there was a dusting brush right next to him. He swatted, poked and stabbed me the entire time, which wasn't long because he was rushing the entire time. It was VERY slow too...  Lastly, my nails look just aweful in general. My boyfriend isn't a nail person but even he can notice that they look bad. That's how I know I'm never going at least not to that guy. Avoid the guy with a gold ring on his ring finger and on the same arm wearing a green bracelet. I want my $46 back, and until I get my money back, this review is staying up, and once I get my nails fixed by someone else, when people ask about my nails I'm telling them how terrible my experience was. And I'm a server so people ask about my nails ALL THE TIME.<//text>< pictures>

Worst nail experience I have had. Rushed job my nails are uneven and crooked. Even after asking her to fix them I gave up and had to leave. Never ever ever recommending or going back. Go to VIP nails instead.< /Review>

The girl was in a rush and when I showed her a pic of what I had in mind she rolled her eyes at me and shook her head no.. so I guess she can only do basic solid colors. A few of my fingers are bleeding and my nails are crooked!!.. I won’t be going back.<//Text>

There were just four of us, and we solved two rooms, but it was very challenging. It is definitely not easy, and we had a great time!</text>

Really great experience. The staff were friendly, patient, helpful, and entertaining. The room itself was very complex, engaging various senses and requiring more creativity than some of the 'find all the keys and codes' rooms.< /review>

Great experience my first time in an escape room! There were 4 of us, and we escaped in 52 minutes. The record was 35 minutes, but we did really well, considering 2 of us had never done it before. The puzzles were interesting and challenging, so that made it fun, and there were all kinds of twists as we went along, which added interest to the game. I highly recommend it and will try another one by Ryptic Room sometime soon!</Text>

Wife and I went last weekend with another couple and we had a great time. The puzzles were clever and more difficult than we expected. We got close to escaping but time ran out, but were still happy with what we accomplished.</text>

We went to this escape room last night and our guide set up an incredible experience.  We didn't know what to expect, but the combination of problem solving, pressured time and competition made things more real than it initially appeared.  Our guide (Darren I believe), was friendly and helpful.  His slightly off unusual sense of humor, along with his genuine interest in the process, only added to the overall fun.  I'd highly recommend ryptic escape rooms to anyone looking for this kind of experience.<//Review>

Haven’t done it myself, but my kids got out of there very excited. They had so much fun. They were only able to unlock three out of four locks, but that didn’t even matter much, because they had a blast!<//Text>

I've been here several times and the food has been consistently delicious. Their customer service is exceptional. They are able to accommodate large groups on short notice.

The food here is better than most high-end Afghani restaurants. You can't go wrong with the Kabab plates. The one thing on the menu I would suggest to avoid is the chicken gyro. It's super thin and dry pieces of chicken. However, the beef gyro is absolutely delicious and juicy. The sauce they use in their gyros is just the right amount.

The only negative things I have to say is they need to upgrade how it looks on the inside and add bathrooms for customers.< /review>

<review>Loved the Lamb Bukhari (Kabuli Pulao), a very tasty and tender lamb shank on a bed of raspberry rice and a little side of the yogurt sauce and raw onions. Best. The lady owner is soo sweet she made me feel like my meal was being prepped by my Gma.  Unfortunately two weeks ago there was an incident with the billboard which fell on the building causing temporary closing. I Live in LA and did not mind the drive and traffuck to Northridge for that dish.< /review>< pics>

<Text>Probably the worst gyro i've ever had. It was really dry and crunchy, no flavor. The sauces and hummus tasted like they were about to go bad and were bland as well. Side salad tasted like it had been in the fridge for days. Definitely won't be back.<//Text>< Pictures>

Best authentic Afghan food in the LA area. The Khala jan who works here is super sweet! Get their mantu and bolani. I'd recommend ordering ahead because they get busy and it can take a while.< /text>

<Review>Good gyro place ...ordered chicken souvlaki plate, spicy wings, and Greek fries...meat and chicken were cooked well but taste wasn't all that impressive...wings were not the traditional ones.. rather it was fried chicken...still... good to have an additional halal place in valley to go to...<//Review>< Rating>

<text>I called in & ordered the vegan veggie pizza around 7 pm on a Saturday night. The wait was about 20-25 minutes so by time I made the walk it was ready. When eating the pizza I could taste the freshness of the sauce & ingredients, very refreshing! I highly recommend visiting!<//text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c29a4c3d0baba3:0x52c427cb6a70a772</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This place is amazing, I have found my new go to spot! I had the Theta Kabob and it was perfect. My Daughter had the Koufa Kabob and I almost ate hers too; I will definitely be back. I hope in your travels that you give this place a try!</text>

Decided to give this place a chance after 6 months of avoiding it. Not only did my food take an extra 30 minutes to make (total of almost 50 minutes since I ordered) the employee never once wore a mask during entire process of making and handing the food off.<//text>

A restuarant is not an easy business. I ordered lamb with rice. The rice was very old. They need to cook the rice on daily basis..this business will shut down soon due to the lack of experience. The owner did her best, but she can't do everything by herself. If they want to do well. They should hire a real chef who can't upgrade the menu. Afghan food is critical! It is not easy to do it.</review>

Great local place to get some lunch. Food took about 15 minutes, and worth the wait. I got a Gyro and the meat wasn't over cooked and soggy. Nice thick cuts. I'll be back.< /Review>

<Text>Ordered a family meal for mothers day to pick up to take to the park with my 2 toddlers. Estimated time to be ready was between 1235P and 1245P. I showed up to pick up my order at 1230P and noticed a sign on the door that's said "be right back" and the door was locked with all lights off. I figured I would would wait a few minutes before I would call. 1240, no one showed up. I called the restaurant number and it rang and rang, no one answered. At this point I'm worried my food wasnt even started yet. 1245 another car pulls up to place an order. I advised them I had placed an order and been waiting for pickup with no luck. The couple called the phone number on the help wanted sign on the door and the owner answered and said she would be right over. About 15 mins later she shows up to open the door and says she can not find my order and asks me to show her on the screen. I pointed it out immediately, the first order placed on her screen. She then says it will be about 10 mins. My first thought was am I getting reheated left overs? This is an authentic halal restaurant I hope it takes longer or there is nothing fresh!  As my two toddler were getting very impatient told her I'd be right back to grab the food. I went to the car and came back several times to check on my food. 140pm my food was completed to pickup. All the owner said was she was sorry for the wait. No discount no extra grape leaves... nothing. Okay well then at this point kiddos are ready for naptime and we just go home. Good thing because they didnt include silverware or napkins, I even specified on order! AND my kids burger was wrong! I asked for everything on the side since well... toddlers. And now I have 2 mad kids and one unhappy mama on mothers day! Great reviews for the taste of food but the worst service I've ever had in my life!< /Text><gmap_id>0x80c29a4c3d0baba3:0x52c427cb6a70a772<//gmap_id>< Response>

<Text>Under the new management this restaurant is doing wonders. I have been to the restaurant a few times, every time I ordered something different. The chapli kabob the gyro the fries everything is perfect wouldn't be a stretch to call them best afghan restaurant in the valley so far. Good work keep it up guys.</Text>< Pics>

< review>
I have been to a lot of restaurants that serve gyros. I am serious when I say this; no two gyros taste the same. The ingredients of gyros are so pungent that the tastes could not be more different once you’re half way through. The gyros at Halal Gyro & Pizza house have the most edgy gyro around. It is made to enjoy the whole way through without growing tired of it. The reason why I like the gyros here probably has something to do with the tzatziki sauce. Or another reason might be the way the gyros are served. Many of the plates are a type of open-faced gyro and are accompanied with rice, and not folded like I’m used to. They prepare it folded also. The kabob dishes are delicious also. They aren’t dry kabobs like I am used to they are not overcooked, but just right.

Then way over on the other side of the spectrum is the other menu items. I thought this was a bit strange, but the sandwiches and pizza are fantastic. I have heard people say that restaurants need to choose what they specialize in. This place has talented chefs and cooks, because I like all of the food. Check the place out if you’re in san Fernando valley, you won’t be sorry.< /review>

Though the food at Gyro & Pizza House is good it lacks in customer service. The staff is frankly rude and don't know how to interact with customers specially ones of different race. DON'T GO HERE if you want to be treated with respect.</review>

Any one who goes for Afghani kabob can knock their place at Perthenia St van nuys. The quality of their food is OK I would suggest give it a try at least once.<//Text>

Whoever said this was the best gyro must have been high.  Terrible gyro plus they charge for extra sauce and drink refills.  Total dump do not eat here.  Couldn't even finish.<//text>

Great cocktails. Like all the bars in their portfolio, really beautiful and unique interior. We went at 3pm when they first opened and was surprised when it had gotten pretty filled up by 3:30, so go early! There's nice outdoor seating, with french bistro chairs and the inside has very high quality glass barriers between seats. (Not sure if they always had them or made them for COVID)< /Text>

Perhaps the best place in all San Diego for craft cocktails with an ever rotating list of drinks and a set menu of classics. Plenty of craft beer on tap too. Food provided from next door Fortunate Son is also pretty good. Lots of heated patio space and open air dining. An excellent place to impress a date or have a perfect drink before bar hopping in North Park. From tiki drinks to whiskey, this is the spot for exciting, well made spirits.< /Review>

Beautiful setting, but lacking in menu options. Their custom cocktails range from mediocre to barely drinkable, and they only had one IPA on tap. Still giving four stars because the atmosphere is THAT nice, and some of the food from the sister restaurant next door was absolutely killer (get the honey shrimp 10/10, and the crab wantons are great too).< /Text>

<review>Polite Provisions. The name is descriptively kind. The menu - an intense well planned forward thinking mix of classic pre-prohibition cocktails, with an unexpected twist for taking tiki bar classics and making them with flare and distinction. Happy hour menu is different than their regular menu. So for the full experience, arrive at 5pm to order from both menus. The polite is for the bartenders - whose passion is ensuring you have a great experience. It’s charm starts as you walk in - a stack of classic books great you at the front door. And it extends to every detail, from the bar stools to table side miniature lamps. The attention to these details - all planned to create that right ambiance - are well executed. So glad I came.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNXc-yc8jbypH1-8q2NAANHCblqRVWdj5rHWa8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYoblr9_QMqIgUaI-vYWDXl83wquXeqzmt0QI=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOXNmfW6_4UIbzQa1V2qI4Pmq4Pw0JDJJLkk6c=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNTvFkr3uvOCUuYs7BUsmI9IRmfiM8cGZXpia8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcFhf0RGj70Fr9Myj_eF7FXl0pakK31ibsAJg=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< response>

<review>Very cool vibe and interesting drinks, only bummer was a very long wait to get in on a Saturday, like an hour wait. The host was very polite about it (get it?) and our drinks were pretty tasty. The bar gets it's food from the chinese place nextdoor which smelled amazing btw but we had already had dinner. I would check this place out as long as you can get in, it is a bit of a distance if you're staying downtown or on the westside of town like we were but still worth the trip.</review><name>Matt Wilson< /name><Date>1620168310817<//Date></record>

<Review>There always seems to be a line outside, and now I know why. It's the fabulous cocktails! Also, since we're now opening back up with Covid, you can get delicious food from Fortunate Son next door while you enjoy those cocktails, so it's just that much better! We had a blast out on the patio!< /Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPqB9CwZcg3C2x6fse8Q-4dhaSq9dWvpIj4PRWL=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics>< resp>

<Text>Cute San Diego neighborhood spot to catch a drink from a creative cocktail list. Patio seating is available and they followed social distancing well. We also got our 10 year old pup along on the patio. He loved it too! You need to order at least an appetizer from the neighboring Chinese food joint called The Fortunate Son per Covid rules against serving alcohol only guests. Both spots seem to be owned by the same owner. I recommend it.<//Text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrAJT4meY4gVqKpU52tpQArQHUi7T3d9UxQaL4=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//pictures>< resp>

<name>Sebastian Falcon</name><time>1563319208977</time><Rate>5<//Rate><Text>Hands down one of my favourite bars. Drinks are next level and ambient is unique. Bartenders always on the look out so you don't have to wait forever for drinks. Nice little patio outside for those hot summer nights. Their punch bowls are pricey and the ice makes it seem like they are big but it's better if you guys get draft cocktail instead of a bowl.<//Text>< Pictures>

<pics>None</pics><review>I was as told it would be a 90 minute wait to be seated. I gave my phone number and was told we'd receive a phone call when our table was ready. We waited patiently for 2+ hours before walking back to find out if we'd be seated. We were greeted with frustration and an obvious eye roll. The employee then explained that we'd likely not be seated. It seems as though we were given an arbitrary wait time. If I had been told from the onset that there was a chance we wouldn't be seated, we would have made alternative arrangements. I make mistakes at my job all the time, but the difference is I hold myself accountable and will apologize when necessary.  I guess the employee didn't like the way we talked to her. I admit, I had a condescending tone. She later confronted us when we were next-door ordering Chinese food and said something passive aggressively. It was extremely childish and disappointing. I can't comment on the service, drinks etc. because I never entered the establishment, but if the host is any indication of the culture of this place, I'd steer clear.<//review></record>

A modern cocktail bar built in a French bistro style. There are plenty of creative and delicious concoctions, a well-rounded beer list, and plenty of comfy seating. Somehow trendy and laid back at the same time. Recommended!<//Review>

Lovely place. Cool, rustic, English type of vibe. The dim lighting gives off the sort of speak-easy aesthetic that inspires this place apparently which is ironic considering how busy this place got while I was there.

The beers on tap are wonderful and the mixed drinks are even cooler. They also have a punch bowl type of drink that is recommended for 4 or more but hey I'm not your mom. The staff is wonderful as well; the door man Jacob even gave me a pin from his lapel which is beyond awesome (if you're reading this Jacob, I'll cherish it forever).

Needless to say, this is a must see place and perfect for a first date if you want to make a good first impression. You're saying, "hey, I might be a heavy drinker but at least I'm classy about it. Hence, why I brought you here." They also serve food i think but I wasn't hungry.<//Text>

We went on a lightning one-afternoon “cocktail tour” trip of San Diego, and Polite Provisions was our second stop, and by far our favorite.

The ambience and setting is fantastic, and the dedication and care that oozes from the cocktail menu, including the hundreds of bottles of syrups, butters and tinctures sitting out on the bar, make it very clear this place is serious about its drinks.

We had several drinks (and some food from the place next door which was awesome), and they were all amazing. The Atomic Dog is by far the best drink I’ve had on this dive-bar trip, and one of the better drinks I’ve had ever. Just stellar flavors and quite a bit of oomph. Can heartily recommend this place.</review>

<review>This place is AMAZING!!! The atmosphere is exquisite, and the vibe is HOT! You could easily be in Paris/Berlin/Vienna circa 1890-1915, instead of San Diego today, but that's just part of the charm. The Bartenders know exactly what they are doing, and no drink disappoints... Bring a friend or two, and enjoy!< /review><name>Thomas Hoyle</name></record>

Oh, WHAT a night to remember... We've been to a couple of Chef Michael Mina's restaurants in Las Vegas and now in Los Angeles and I can say with all honesty, we've not ever been disappointed.  We were invited to celebrate my brother's-in-law 20th Wedding Anniversary with more family.  My brothers-in-law who are wine lovers brought 2 wines from their cellar.<//Text>

The images are for the festive Winter Holidays: Christmas & Hanukkah.

Delicious, creative cocktails & beautiful venue styling. Vintage feeling with quartz & copper accents.

Have not had the opportunity but, can order food next door and that restaurant will bring it over.

Cute bar to check out with friends or a date.

Sister Bar to Raised by Wolves in UTC Mall & 2 other cocktail lounges in San Diego.< /Review>

<review>Really cool bar. Reminds me of an old soda parlor, but this place definitely services sweet adult beverages instead. Unique old-timey decor, fun atmosphere, and a great selection of beers and cocktails makes Polite Provision a must.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Not A Critic Just A Customer!!!!!!!!!!!!
*Ultimate Thumbs Up*
*Out of the Ordinary*
*A must stop by*
Easy to find, very visible from street, nice location with pedestrian indulging in their choice Polite Provisions. While visiting SD this was one of the places my nephew Chauncey took us, let me just say I enjoyed myself immensely! The atmosphere was very lively,  everyone was chatting and having a great time.the staff was great!!!!!
I had the opportunity to chat with a few of them and they were very welcoming and educating me on the many  different  and unique drinks they were preparing, It was a delight watching each of them as they added their own special touch as if they could mix these drinks while  blindfoldedI (just kidding) but they must be doing something very right because the orders kept coming and they kept pouring.
Although we went there for drinks we did try the sliders, they were so delicious and yummy. The drinks are so awesome! Their infused  mints, hibiscus, orange etc. My drink of choice was the Zombie, (I will.plead the fifth as to why I think they called it that) and it was just as tasty as it was artistically arranged. Not to mention the vast choice of beer to please the palet of just about any beer could want.
Overall Pollite Provisions gets five stars!!!! Great job guys!!! and y'all really should consider opening a location to Nashville!!!!!</Review>< date>

We came for the Miracle Pop Up during Christmas. The line to get in is well worth the 20-30 min wait. The decor was amazing! You felt like you were in the North Pole and the drinks were all Christmas themed and delicious! I highly recommend this place.<//text>

A exceptional meal.  Escargot, lobster bisque, truffled mac & cheese, rib eye, & Saison to wash it down.  A must visit.  Say goodnight to the bad guy, it's all good here.  Unfortunately, they were out of the cinnamon toast crunch.  The souffles and torte were underwhelming compared to the rest of the meal.  We shall have coffee and dessert elsewhere next time.<//review>

Sad to hear they closed.  Everytime I went to town I made it point to stop here for a cocktail or two.  Their bartenders knew how to make a drink.

Also the soda and swine next door was amazing as well.<//text>

<review>Best place for cocktails! So delicious. Friendly service, big place but crowded. Very hip and cool place to have a drink and hang out with friends. Better when it's not crowded but it's so popular. They make really good cocktails.</review>< Pics>

I love this place's decor and vibe. The old-timey pharmacy look is amazing. Makes me wish I was dressed up when I come here. Pretty trendy so the prime weekend times can get VERY crowded. Wonder selection of cocktails with skilled bartenders. Not cheap, but pretty good. I love that you can get Soda & Swine food delivered here.<//Text>

<text>If you've never been to Polite Provisions, now is the time to do while they have it decorated in full Christmas mode! They go out of control with the decorations!

The Christmas drinks are also an amazing annual treat. Do yourself a favor and try the bad Santa.

The staff are some of the best drink slingers in town.</text>< userid>

Loved the apothecary feel and the way the menu is set up. Unique drinks with exciting ingredients. Good for 1-2 drinks because they are a tad overpriced but worth it for specialty cocktails.< /review>

< Review>
This place was easily my favorite cocktail bar in San Diego. Great menu of house cocktails with a deep spirit selection and a knowledgeable bar staff to make you a myriad of off menu drinks from classics to something new an inventive. Highly recommend. I look forward to visiting next time I’m in San Diego.</Review>

<Text>Always a fun time here. Really good drinks and a VERY reasonable price. All the drinks I've tried on the menu are good. All the punch bowls are good too. They also have food there from the attached restaurant in the back that you can order in the bar. Haven't really eaten the food there other than the truffle fries but they were good as well. Definitely a fun spot in San Diego that is away from the huge crowds of the Gas Lamp.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>My girlfriend and I have been coming to Sidebar for a year now and have probably been about 10-11 times. We can't help but order the same thing EVERY time - the clams.

Very festive for Christmas. They have raised their prices, but it’s still a great place for a cocktail or two.</Text>

Arcade games and beer. What more could you want? Ok, well, a few (vegan) food items would be nice but we can't get everything. Came here recently and had a few beers and corn nuts while the bartender had the best shoegaze mix on the stereo. Almost afraid to go back, as I don't think the experience could be that good again. But with the variety of beers they have on tap, you know I will be.<//text>

If I ever need a great drink for a great night, I get it here.

Edit: 6-1-2018
This classy cocktail joint has had my heart since I've visited a few years back.  I come back every month to sample new creations and old favorites.

I love coming back an bringing friends to share my fondness of this place.

Grab some food next door and enjoy sipping a drink as the night creeps on by< /text>

Came here one night and had a few drinks with my wife. It was pretty busy for a Tuesday night. The staff was great, very friendly and helpful. The drinks where on point and we will be returning when ever we are in town.</text>

Had a nice time at Polite Provisions. For a rainy night the whole place was packed.  The vibe was cool, dark and mysterious. The drinks were good. I shared a bowl with a friend and had some sort of daiquiri.  Both were good. We also ordered at soda and swine and they brought our food over to us. I'll def come back again for some good drinks.</Text>

Best bar to meet up at after Sunday brunch. The bartenders are friendly and the drinks are top notch. Also the actual design and structure of the place is definitely photo worthy.<//Review>

The drink menu is different which is good or bad depending on what you like. With covid rules, The interior is set up with stylish dividers rather than just plexiglass. While I miss soda and swine, fortunate son food is a great addition. However, service hasn't changed in that they are all friendly but the servers can take a little too long to do a 2nd sweep to check for a 2nd round. Luckily, the drinks are good enough to be worth the wait.</Text>

<text>PARKING: There is street parking only.

AMBIANCE/DECOR: Beautiful ambiance and details throughout.

SERVICE: The service is good. It's a little slow when its busy but that's to be expected at a bar.

FOOD/DRINKS: Food is provided by the establishment next door. You place the order next door and they will delivery it to you. All their cocktails are delicious.

Overall, really love this place. My go to for good drinks and good times with friends.< /text></record>

Great place for cocktails.  Extensive special drink menu. I am a beer drinker - very nice selection.  If you want food you can order at Soda & Swine.  Very nice non- expensive menu.  They will deliver to you at Polite Provisions. " Same Owner".  Highly recommend.< /Text>

< Review>
Dude this is a great and trendy place to have drinks. I can't recommend one drink because everything that I tasted there was delicious. Everything from extremely smokey scotch or Mezcal to fruity gin or vodka drinks. The one thing I would tell you to watch out for is a drink on the menu called "zombie" that drink is so tasty and deceiving. Lol you need to take it easy with that one!

We had amazing cocktails beings served in no time ! Ambiance is noisy but friendly and welcoming. Servers are super cordial. In case you are hungry, you can order food from next door restaurant, Soda and Swine.</Review>

May you never have to live your life having not drank deliciously. If you’ve never enjoyed a cocktail from Polite Provisions, you’ve already done yourself a disservice. Every drink I’ve gotten here has been SO good. There’s no doubt they’re always pretty busy, but with the aesthetic + unique and refreshing menu, id be upset if they weren’t the talk of the town! Here’s me a few months ago with some overly intoxicated Germans. I’m telling ya, you can’t go wrong with this place! Although now that I’ve told you, I probably need to start booking my reservations months in advance..... just kidding they don’t take reservations.</review>

<Text>Perfect spot to kick it and have a few, or alot, of amazing drinks. Spent a couple hours here and it was a blast. Music wasn't too loud, just perfect to carry a convo without yelling. Great ambiance with the soft lighting and wall decor.
Only thing I'm still trying to figure out was ordering our drinks. Being my first time here, my group was under the impression the "waitress" was going to take our drink orders since she came by to say hi, and dropped off some drink menus. We waited 20 minutes before finally going straight to the bar.</Text></record>

I wanted so badly to love this place, but I can't. The desperate attempt at a classiness that just isn't there is disappointing.<//review><response>None< /response>< Pics>

< Review>
Great craft cocktail spot. I have many favorites. Last spring I had a cocktail with avacado that was aaahmazing. We went to celebrate a birthday during December and they go ALL out for christmas and have a holiday cocktail menu. And the christmaspolitan was my favorite. They do craft cocktails right... there is no trying to hard to be different that they compromise a tasty drink! Everything I've tried I have liked, even drinks that have my least favorite liquor.<//Review>

<Review>Now that Polite has been around for 5 years.... what that’s crazy.... they are pairing down their menu and focusing on different types of drinks that make them great! We tried so many new drinks and it made me miss some of the old drinks a lot less. I miss some of the old bar staff, but the current staff is so friendly and makes things happen right away.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures><Name>Rachel Clark</Name><Gmap_id>0x80d954fe470dcc6f:0x8c1efd83fe86918c< /Gmap_id>< time>

Have bookmarked this place for a long period of time as well as ultimately got the opportunity to go ... my guy as well as I came right here on among our day evenings and also we liked it !! Outstanding ambiance and also such one-of-a-kind styles !! Much like every person has discussed, this most definitely has a speakeasy feeling which I love! They have an excellent listing of cocktails in addition to draft beer and also wines. They likewise have strike bowls and common drinks if you're can be found in with a team. The drinks were so yummy yet does the job! I was already really feeling a mild head modification after a couple of sips but could not stop beverages because it tasted so good! You can likewise order from the restaurant next door Soda< /text>

The drinks here were solid, the bartender was cool. A little on the pricey side, but the quality was worth it.</Text>

Drinks are over priced and it's crazy busy all the time. There is also no room to stand or sit. The staff is really nice though.</Text>

Elegant, swanky, classy, unique - all describe this singular gem in a sea of noisy sports bars. With a art nouveau vibe and craft cocktails sure to please even the most sophisticated palate, this is an ideal place for a date or girls/boys night out. Quiet enough for conversation, lively enough to ride the wave of energy all night.</review>

Fun spot with wonderful cocktails. Happy hour is half off drinks which is the best deal. I was there, 3 friends x3 drinks each = $109
There is outdoor seating and they have parking available in lot behind them or the street.  Definitely check out, great staff too!</review>

Cocktails with gin or vodka of that brand. The drink we got was delicious and the service was impeccable, as usual. We got to sit outside and even though it was a little early in the evening, Amy let the lanterns on the outside wall and on every table so we could feel welcome. Great experience, as always, can't wait to go back.<//Review>< Pictures>

Thus is a San Diego must-see for any foodies, mixology fans and atmosphere junkies visiting AND local to SD! This first Consortium Holdings creation became a national legend for its mixology when it opened, and the cocktails are unbeatable. The vintage pharmacy feel is gorgeous, hipster, and the perfect place for a sexy date or girls catchup night. Love it!<//Text>

Dope ambience. One of my new favorite places. Definitely go if you're a cocktail person! It's hard to find places that have great cocktails for a great price and the variety was amazing. Anyone can find a drink they love for a good price here. Happy hour is definitely where its at! I have two different bourbon drinks. One sweet and one stronger. I can see this being a great date place  to casually grab drinks since  it gets dark and is lit by little lamps at each table. I'll definitely be coming back to this place to bring friends especially when I have friends from out of town.<//text>

If you are into cocktails, this place is for you! If you are thinking about getting into cocktails and want to ask questions to expand your cocktail knowledge, this place is also for you. If you're not super into cocktails, I'd still recommend this place. Drinks were amazing, but just had such a comfortable vibe. It's worth noting that they don't serve food themselves, but there's a place right next door where you order at their counter, and they will bring you your order in the bar.< /review>

Hmmm this place has amazing atmosphere and the bartenders LOOK like they know what they're doing,  but all the cocktails I had here were overly-boozy and not excellent. Ordered a mai tai first, and it just tasted like liquor. No dark rum float, no fruity base.

Second drink I ordered specifically for the absinthe was the Layover in Paris. Turns out theres a "dash of absinthe" for aroma, but it was missing the punch in flavor I wanted.

Expensive cocktails that are just boozy and unappetizing, and flashy servers who just need to relearn their drinks. Sorry, PP!< /Review>

Cool bar with a historic feel to it. Very high ceilings and amber dim lighting with leather topped bar stools lining the bar and a few wooden booths. Our bartender worked quickly and was friendly. This is also one of the few bars the fiance and I have seen have a bottle of Pappy Van Winkle among the bar collection.< /Review>

<Review>We walked by and saw the incredibly chic decor and some customers with food, and thought this would be a great place for lunch. We walked in, and there wasn’t any signage or direction for seating (seat yourself or wait to be seated: no idea!), and the bartender offered a quiet, meek greeting but no direction.
We finally decided to seat ourselves, and noticed a waitress was talking to customers who were leaving. She chatted with them for a solid ten minutes, during which she made eye contact with me at least once. I got up and fetched menus, only to find only cocktails and no food. As we were looking through the menu, I made eye contact with the waitress 3 more times before we decided to leave.
We spent 20 minutes in this establishment and was offered no service whatsoever. Considering there weren’t many customers present, this was incredibly surprising.
We will likely not give this place a second chance.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>This bar I would consider a bit on the classy side. Good drinks, and the interior of the establishment is different/unique. Comfortable environment; good for relaxing. The bar used to have a full menu with many various cocktails ranging from all sorts, however they got rid of this and changed it to a smaller, simpler drink menu. That is the main reason I place 4 stars instead of 5.< /review>< Rate>

<text>It's an okay bar. It's attached to another business that serves food and they'll deliver the food to your table in Polite Provisions which is convenient if part of your party wants food with their drinks.

The drinks are pricey. Some of our party got one of the mixed drinks on the menu and it definitely needed to be stirred but it was still too syrupy and sweet for us.

I think someone was late to their shift because the server we had seemed very annoyed and rushed. She left us at our table for a while so we assumed she wasn't coming back, so someone in our party just ordered at the bar. When she finally returned to our table she saw the drink and acted extremely annoyed. I'm assuming because it'll affect tip but she wasn't around to order from and there's a bar to order at so...
Eventually we saw a woman rush into the back and then reappear and after that we saw our server a bit more but she still seemed stressed out. I get it, everyone has those days.

The decor is nice and there's a good number of indoor and outdoor tables. I think it could be very nice on a day everyone shows up to work and if you don't mind spending more on drinks that are less expensive elsewhere.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None</response><gmap_id>0x80d954fe470dcc6f:0x8c1efd83fe86918c< /gmap_id></record>

Fabulous atmosphere, but no climate control inside.  Our waitress was very polite and professional, and lovely.  Unfortunately we did not have the same experience with one of the bartenders who seemed very annoyed.  He also chastised a member of my crew for touching the bottles of ingredients on display on the bar.  Probably shouldn't put items on the bar, within reach of the customers, if they're not to be touched.  Or at least put up a sign saying as much.< /Text>

By far my favourite bar in San Diego. The atmosphere is magical with exposed rafters, plants and vintage decor, great lighting, and lots of history. The drinks are extensive, tasty, whimsical and everything in between that you could possibly be craving. The floor is made of nickles. There is also Soda & Swine attached which makes this the ultimate perfect date spot. Yummy food, great ambiance, reasonable prices, fantastic drinks, & the list can go on.

Polite has the absolute best seasonal drinks and a colouring book menu. The highest recommendation possible goes to this spot <3</Review>

<text>Pretty cool bar modeled like an old fashioned pharmacy (maybe it used to be?) Great vibe, great cocktails, and the happy hour has a good selection of cocktails for $5. It's a super hipster place, but I dig it. You can order food next door and they will serve you here if you want. Very limited parking in a small lot next door, otherwise good luck finding street parking, which is the only downside.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80d954fe470dcc6f:0x8c1efd83fe86918c</GmapID></record>

All the bartenders were super knowledgeable and super friendly. They also had several of the best cocktails I've ever had. Definitely plan to go more than once. You can also order food from the restaurant next door, I did not, but the food looked good.< /Review><user_id>113066666272928765455< /user_id><Date>1483319887170<//Date><Resp>None</Resp>< Rate>

Huge list of unique, tasty, drinks, accompanied by an eclectic environment, and cool mixed crowd.  Must be 21 to enter.  Drinks only BUT you can order your food next door and they'll deliver it to you (same owner shared bathroom).  Dress as you wish.  Try the Zombie... my new favorite fruity drink.  Limit 2 per guest.  There's a reason for that.  And oh yeah... three drinks plus decent tip $30 : )</Text>

I was in the neighborhood a couple weeks ago for a soft opening of a friend's business and ended up here...
I'm not one to wait in a line, but the wait wasn't bad and the door guy was cool, so...
Good mix of people, a chick grabbed me by the neck while waiting in the bathroom line and started kissing me...I did not reciprocate...as cool or funny as that sounds, imagine if I had done that to a woman :-/  I immediately took a shot to disinfect my soul.
I almost never give 5 stars. And I only took away 1 star because I didn't pay for drinks that night so, i'm unaware of their pricing.
I'd go here again...but be aware that some of these older women aren't trying to tell you a secret :-/<//text><user_name>Brian N< /user_name><UserId.>100678468788415038685< /UserId.></record>

This place is old-school classy. I feel so fancy every time I’m here. Service is friendly yet can be a bit slow, but the place has always been packed so it’s not unreasonable. The drinks are superb. I’ve tried just about every cocktail on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.</review>

<review>One of the few places in San Diego where you will find great cocktail for $8. Not all cocktails are $8 but you can get an mean old fashion or other delicious well made cocktail for $8. This is place awesome, with great vibe and beautiful design. It will get super crowded in weekend, mixed with cocktail enthusiast and wannabes that is just there for the scene. Weeknight are nice and happy hours time are pleasant. Regardless, the bartenders will not disappoint, they will pump out quality cocktails with any crowd size. That's why they won the Great Cocktail at High Volume for 2013 Tales of the Cocktails. Absolutely one of my favorite cocktail bar in SD hands down!<//review>< Pics>

Love taking people here as they make good mixed drinks. The ambiance is cool, and fun place to hang on any night of the week. It's a good place to take people if you don't want to go downtown, or north county, or east county. There are plenty of good food places around also<//review>

Came to the Christmas popup. Amazing! The Jingle Bells eggnog was so delicious. Our bartender Gabe was outstanding! He was friendly, informative, very happy to talk while mixing drinks quickly and efficiently for the crowd. He suggested a vodka I'd never heard of...not the usual. It was great and I'm quite selective. Trust whatever he offers! Overall super fun experience! Planning on going to the popup in Dallas.<//Review>

Ridiculously crowded all the time; this time there was even a line to get in. Couldn't hear the people I was trying to talk to because it was so noisy inside. Always really expensive drinks and a 15 minute line to get one from the bar. Fun Christmas lights.<//review>

<Review>Craft cocktails on tap? Yes, please! Plenty of options to chose from.  Yes, they are on the pricey side.  But, oh so worth it.  Love the punch bowls as well. Loving the new side patio. If you really want to sit and enjoy this place, Sunday afternoon is my suggestion.  Friday and Saturday night are too busy for my taste.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Oh man, this place rocks. It can get packed in the evening, but the cocktails are superb and well worth the wait. The best part about this spot has got to be the staff though. The bar tenders deserve some serious praise for their skill, their savvy, and the way they make you feel at home even when it's packed. Best place in town to wind down, strike a conversation with someone and enjoy the best cocktails known to humankind.</Text>

Polite provisions is an upmarket cocktail haunt with a laid back unpretentious vibe. An ever changing craft beer list, draft cocktails, of high caliber, to keep the pace as well as some fresh crafted cocktails for the connoisseur.

On top of that if you can't remember what you drank last time but really liked it, just ask your server. They seem to have a photographic memory.</text>

<review>I used to love Polite Provisions but usually avoid it on busy weekend days because it gets way too super crowded. The atmosphere of this bar is overshadowed by the loud noise of the crowds. You are definitely yelling in order to hear someone. The servers however do a pretty amazing job at getting over to you to refill drinks. The cocktails are tasty but I do think you can get amazing artisanal cocktails in San Diego for cheaper (and in taller glasses)< /review>< username>

I got the First Lady which consisted of gin, blueberry, and lavender soda, and although it was premixed, it was literally the best cocktail I've ever had. My husband got The Zombie and WOOH, it was STRONG! The food, which comes from Soda and Swine next door, is really good. It was pretty crowded inside Polite Provisions though, so the only downside was that we couldn't take our cocktails with us next door to S&S where we ended up eating.</Text><pics>None</pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

< Review>
Went on a pretty crowded night so we had to line up outside for a bit. Thankfully we didn't have to wait too long. I really liked the look of the place and the decor was very nice. They really put the time and effort into their drinks. I ordered an old fashion and it was very good. As a group we shared a punch bowl, can't remember which but I believe there was Pimms in it. Pretty cool that the punch bowl came with a huge block of ice that was decorated with different citrus fruits frozen within it. Because it was a huge block it didn't water down the drink as quickly seeing as the punch bowl took a bit of time to finish. Luckily we found a table to chill at and everyone was pretty friendly for how inebriated they were. The ambiance was nice, lowly lit with little gas lamps on the tables. When I visit SD again I would definitely come back.</Review>

Beautifully designed speakeasy style bar with adjoining restaurants.  Children are not permitted in the bar and so you'll be eating next door in the semi sheltered restaurant.  Most of the staff here is super friendly, though we did run into a bartender that was inattentive and slow.  One of many creative restaurants and bars this group owns in the area.  They have a similar restaurant and bar in Liberty Station that I prefer and where children are permitted.</Text>

Two words: punch bowl!! Met a few friends here who had already ordered one before I got there. No idea what kind (or if they have different kinds) but I thought it was so cute! This place also has awesome decor and is overall a great atmosphere. Perfect place to hang out with some friends and grab drinks. I wish it was a little bigger though!<//Review>

<Text>Got a drink here with a friend about 6 PM. Very stylish, service was good, drinks were good. Got too noisy to talk as the place filled in. They don't serve food here, but you can order from next door. I would probably stop here with a group of friends for a drink,  but not my first pick for a longer night of socializing (too loud).< /Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Love coming here for to unwind. Their drinks are so good and worth the money spent. I love the Zombie, it's tropical and sweet with a little bite (punny right)! The punch bowl is a crowd favorite. We get one to start the night off and it usually lasts us for a few hours.  The food from next door at Soda and Swine is delicious. Your can order and they will deliver it to your table! Their dirty fries and the pizza knots are my favorite.  Definitely recommend giving it a go!</Review><pictures>None</pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< Gmap_id>

I love the automosphere and its' quirky elements. The lamp post in the bar is also a nice touch. The server comes to you and ask you would like.
The drinks itself was too sweet and not strong enough. I understand it's a cocktail, but if i just turn pink and not red it's a good indication of a weak drink.
My friends and I ordered:
- Casual Encounter: The rose fragrance was pretty good, but a tad too sweet and my friend and I exchanged this drink. She prefer this over the bourbon taste from brave companion.
- Brave Companion: It a bit stronger than casual encounter, there was a strong aroma of bourbon, but it wasn't strong enough. Good cocktail drink nonetheless. I prefer a bit of acidity with my drinks so I would order this again.
- Coffee Cocktail: I don't quite remember the name of this, but it was minty and overly sweet. My friend quite liked this.
It is known as the best bar in San Diego so I expected a lot better. I am sure they hate being compared to other bartenders but coming from Houston where Alba Huerta lives...it's hard not to have a baseline to compare to. Polite provisions is not able to compete in Houston, but suitable for San Diego. Their patrons are a bit snobbish, but other than that pretty decent place to sit down and talk to your friends.<//Text>

The place is okay. Gets really crowded and is super loud. The decor and building is beautiful, and the drinks were tasty, although I didn't feel were very strong. The servers seemed overwhelmed and not too friendly. In general, the place was just over rated. I'd go again but not any time soon.< /Text>

The ambiance is great at this bar. It can get very crowded on the weekends, but if you get a table with service, the crowds aren't so bad. I'm not a huge fan of the cocktails. Every one I have ordered has just been ok. Overall, it is a fun spot.< /Review>

<Rating>1<//Rating><text>First off - the drinks here are pretty good.  The decor is nice, reminds me of what I would like to do with my home bar.  However that's where the good things end.  Our hostess was nice but every other staff member we interacted with was borderline rude.   Wait staff were slow and unconcerned with patrons.  Bar staff acted like they had better things to do than make drinks.  The atmosphere wasn't great - a lot of pretentious trust fund babies.  Maybe if we had gone at an off time these things would have been better, but as it is we have no desire to return.<//text>< Name>

honestly , probably one of the most classy places I have been to in a while that doesn't require you to be wearing your best , but if you happen to go there dressed up you won't look out of place . the drinks are phenomenal if your willing to try something new and leave the vodka red bulls to another bar .< /text>

The best cocktails in the area and you can order food from soda and swine and have them bring it to you at the bar. This is one of my favorite spots in San Diego! Dirty fries and uncle jalapenos!< /text>

<Text>Go here for drinks, confusingly go next door for food at Soda & Swine, which is owned by the same people. Cocktails are OK. Food from next door was good, but it would be easier if they just took your food order at the table. Why does it have to be so hard?<//Text>< Pictures>

<text>This is the rare "it" bar that actually deserves the hype. Looking like a very Instagram-friendly, minimalistic old-fashioned soda shop with huge windows that open onto 30th St, Polite Provisions is a sort of Mecca for San Diego's craft cocktail connoisseurs. Knowledgeable, skilled, and occasionally snooty bartenders serve up drinks that are delicious and inventive-- the Loaded Pistol and Rite of Passage are personal favorites-- but do take some time to make. Patience is a virtue here!< /text>< Pics>

The last few times I have been here, i have been unimpressed by the staff. The customer service has gone downhill. They do not have enough servers or bartenders to cover their needs. The staff seem annoyed most of the time, negating their namesake.  Although the drinks and food are still amazing, they are missing the mark on customer service.</review><Rate>3<//Rate><Date>1512087857869</Date><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

<Review>Favorite bar in North Park/San Diego! Reasonable priced cocktails, big menu, and nice atmosphere. I usually get the Kentucky Buck which is a staple drink that is refreshing. This place gets very busy so be sure to show up early if you want to get a table (before 9). You can also order food next door (Soda & Swine) and they will bring it over to you. Be sure to follow their Instagram for news and seasonal events (they decorate the entire place xmas themed).< /Review><Gmap_id>0x80d954fe470dcc6f:0x8c1efd83fe86918c</Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp></record>

<review>Everything about this place is great. The decor is unique and interesting, the drinks are varied and delicious, and you can order food next door from Soda & Swine and eat it here. Their cocktails are delicious for the most part and are decently priced, at least as far as "craft" cocktails go. Like craft and commerce? Come here instead. It's the same owners but much much cheaper. If you have a group, go for the punch bowl - they are worth it.<//review>< gmapID>

Had a kettle one moscu mule, which was just what i was looking for and was very well made (metal cup and all). Good service, cocktail drinks are what you’d expect from a place like this, 14.50. Service was normal good, not too much (fake) or too little (lack of service). We made a reservation from other review recommendations, but place was half empty on a Wed. Food prices also on the higher end, but the food was very tasty.< /Text>

Cool little cocktail bar with good drinks and a decent beer selection. It's a little on the expensive side for the cocktails and it's usually pretty crowded, which combined with the tile interior, makes it really loud. Not my favorite, but still a solid place.< /review>

<Review>The Christmas decorations were pretty incredible, they literally lit up the neighborhood with lights, people and good vibes. The Christmas special drinks were also delicious and original-- I recommend Bad Santa, it's a slippery slope but definitely worth it!</Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Fantastic drinks are mixed here. Recently came down to San Diego and was recommended this place and it did not disappoint. Their beer is excellent albeit pricy. Favorite thing about Polite Provisions is being able to order food next door and have it delivered to myself at Polite Provisions.</Review>

Great decor and setting. I'm not a fan of their pre-mixed cocktails, personally. The food is all very good, it comes from next door (Soda and Swine). Overall, a great place.<//Text>

Makes me feel like I'm in a bar in the early part of the 20th century. Great drink selections and the music is at the right level. You can also order food from soda and swine next door and they will deliver it right over.<//review>

Decent drinks, but expensive, yet good vibes. I used to come here a lot a few years ago, and I'm sure the place is still busy with a line of the door for both the bar and Soda and Swine.

Generally strong drinks.

Mostly street parking, with a few slots in the assigned lot.</Review>

Wonderfully mixed drinks and inventive cocktails, but a bit on the pricey side. As a Midwesterner, I'd prefer a 24 pack of Stag (and the pocket change left) over the cost of one small bourbon cocktail there...</Review>

An almost overwhelmingly large selection of cocktails but everyone can find at least one they will like! Service here is ok, our waitress/server was a bit snippy and couldn't split a check and told us to "just venmo it, our system can't split checks" despite us asking if it was possible earlier and hey confirming that it was possible. The other servers seemed to be nicer though!</review>

Had a great time here celebrating a friend's promotion. The place has an "old timey" feel, and the staff have serious style. They're committed to the theme without feeling hokey- and it pays off. The drink menu is great and varied, something for everyone. I personally really liked the Kentucky Buck- serious ginger goodness. The food is provided by the Soda & Swine, which is next door. I personally haven't tried the food or the house made sodas, but I'd 100% go back to do so.</text>

< Review>
We had been excited for months to check out Polite Provisions. We finally had an opportunity on a truly special occasion - our honeymoon. Mae, the hostess, was so rude and nasty to us, and kicked us out due to my ID which lapsed a few days ago, despite the fact that I am in my mid 30s. We attempted to express our discontent at how poorly the situation was handled and the other hostess was even more rude than Mae. She rolled her eyes before literally running to the back of the house to avoid addressing our complaint. After this encounter, I can definitely say that "Polite Provisions" was anything but polite. If you're looking for a fun night out, stay away from this pretentious bar.</Review>

Super nice bar had the vibe of a Speakeasy but still modern. A little noisy with the small space but overall a great time< /review>

<Text>I am a whiskey drinker, and my friends are beer drinkers and we all seem to find awesome unique drinks each time we visit.  The décor and bartenders make you feel like you have stepped back in time.  Great location away from downtown.  Fun atmosphere to meet up with friends at!< /Text>< pictures>

Great decor, hip young crowd, and great drink options. What's not to like? t's too popular! Even on a Sunday night at 9PM there is no place to sit. Either way, I love this place and I like to take friends from out of town here too. Great spot off Adams/30th.</Text>

Their crafted cocktails are the bomb, albeit pricey. They are unique and great tasting. Bartenders are awesome and highly knowledgable on their liquor. It's fun bringing visitors here to enjoy a quality drink. Server waitresses are hit or miss, mostly miss- they can be somewhat pretentious and frequently look annoyed. Avoid it and sit at the bar!<//review>

Great place for restrooms. They have boraxo hand soap, a fantastic powder mineral soap that can kill even insects. Nice ambience with sophisticated cocktails. Unfortunately this place has a poor management. A crew of kids with no experience and clue about good manners and customers interactions. They pretend to be adults but unfortunately they act just ridiculously unprofessional. The owner should choose better people to manage this property. Good luck</review>

< Review>
Stopped here on my way out of town. Gabe served us and was fantastic. The decor and the menu are incomparable, and I wish there were a place like Polite Provisions in my city. Gabe made us custom drinks based off our preferences, but I particularly enjoyed the Kentucky Buck (bourbon, lemon, strawberry and homemade ginger beer.)

The menu includes a list of flavors to expect in each drink, and even shows what type of glass it's served in. I can't stop raving about this place - which makes sense, as it was highly recommended by a few local friends. I would've happily paid more than what they charge - drinks were about $8 each, and you can have small plates delivered from the food place next door ($2-8 each). The dirty fries were excellent.<//Review>

<text>I love the decoration in this bar, and the staff is very friendly, the bar does not offer food, but you can buy food frommnextbdoor and eat it at the bar( you can actually order it from inside the same building) and the food is not that expensive. I had the drinks with tequika and mezcal and they were very good. Not to sweet and refreshing.</text>< pictures>

good drinks and weak drinks, ask the tender for recommendations | the less than perfect review is because of a mule - it was not served in the proper glass, and the mixture tasted like powder. Other than that, chill spot enjoy exotic drinks</text>

< Review>
Polite Provisions makes some of the best cocktails in town. Have been here on multiple occasions and never disappointed with quality of drinks. The beer selection is a good highlight of San Diego craft beers as well. It is adjoined with Soda and Swine - the meatball sliders are great to soak up all the booze! Great vibe and plenty of space for groups or couples. I like the old school decor and the chill atmosphere created by the very professional and hospitable staff and bartenders.</Review>

Bar:

Aesthetics && Mixology: 11 out of 10

What a great sort of old-timie meets alternate reality meets distraction from the rest of the world type place this is. From it's ceiling to it's chairs to it's taps and beyond, just sitting in Polite Provisions with some friends is a treat. Add to that a wonderful list of drinks and you have a great place to wet your whistle. Love it!<//review>

Tried on two different occasions, months apart, not inpressed with drinks at all. Bartenders have huge egos and can't even make a decent Manhattan. Other drinks are bitter and mediocre. We won't be back, even though we love the atmosphere. Maybe they should change the name to Impolite Provisions? What a shame!!! 😓 And yes, I have bartending experience and I know what I'm talking about.</text>

My boyfriend and I recently moved from New York to San Diego, and this bar was recommended by several friends. We went on a Saturday evening, around 11:30. Yes it was busy, but not annoyingly busy. The bartenders were all very attentive, getting our drink orders immediately for a few rounds. The decor is nostalgic and inviting, they completely hit the mark. The drink menu was diverse, and the food menu simple. Exactly what you would want from an evening out. There were no College bro's as stated above, it was actually an older crowd. Maybe things have changed since it opened, I don't know. What I do know is I felt the need to defend this place, it's wonderful and i'll be frequenting it often.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Noisy as hell, but what do you expect from a bar?

Old fashioned milk shake tasted like crap, and cost $5 for a drink with no alcohol. I've had better at burger king, McDonald's, Wendy's, etc.

Worst of all, the milkshake was $3 on the menu, and they charged $5. What a bunch of frauds. Never going there again!< /Review>

I used to like this place a lot, I always recommend this to all my friends from Mexico, the place has a great vibe and awesome cocktails. That's why I was so surprised today that I went there and they wouldn't take my ID (my tourist VISA which was provided by the US consulate) because it is not an American ID, i explained the person in charge that I have another bunch of Mexican ID's that I can show him, and he said it didn't matter because they all are easy to forfit, I'm 30 btw. So all that was really insulting especially cause I've been there several times, anyways it's kinda sad cause It was a good place, but It's even sadder to be treated like that when you're a tourist trying to meet new places.<//Text>

Excellent cocktail bar, which also benefits from the great grub from Soda & Swine next door. Since it has grown in popularity, though, PP tends to get very crowded...< /review>

One word: Haymaker! Seriously, I love the haymaker, but any and all of the drinks I've had here have been delicious! They have punch bowls full of alcohol (which Ive yet to try) that look like they have a great kick!  As previously mentioned, they're attached to Soda & Swine, which makes it super convenient if you start to have the munchies a few Haymakers in... just beware, the drinks are STRONG so you might want to rustle up a DD or call a cab (the fare alone is worth the trip).<//review>

<time>1369588193043</time><Text>Are you in love with the Adam's Ave quaint atmosphere? Do you prefer beers to cocktails, and bars to clubs? If so, Polite Provisions is not for you. Imagine LA vomitted on your favorite SD neighborhood and the once relatively deserted area is now littered with loud, douchey downtowners and the girls they sleep with. Polite Provisions has done just that.

PP initially impresses with its unique decor and design but quickly loses its novelty due to the overwhelming similarity to every nightclub you've ever been to - complete with horrible service by deaf bartenders that won't take your drink order, guys looking to score at all costs, stuck up plastic airheads, and drinks that cost and arm and a leg.

Do yourself a favor and head down the street across the 805 bridge for a more accurate reflection of Adams.</Text></record></dataset><record>

<Text>this is one of my fav bars. busy on fri and saturday but welcome to san diego, thats nothing new. some of the drinks are a tad too sweet but all are interesting, and of course if you ask for whatever the bartenders always seem to do just fine. overall a good spot to know.</Text>< Pics>

this is a place that whisks you away from the typical san diego. my first impression? i almost felt like i was at the venetian in vegas. something about the architecture and details, especially the ceiling. and even though the large side windows open right up to adams ave outside it, you dont feel like you are sitting in a bar in normal heights one bit. as many people have already noted, it is seriously night and day from the old days of kadan.

its classy, bright, open, and airy. it is lively and social, yet comfortable and casual. you get the ambiance of being in a fun, popular and ever-busy bar, but still have the ability to hold a conversation with your friends without screaming.  quite simply, its an overall wonderful place to have a drink and stay a while.

...and stay a while you shall with such delectable beverages.

on my first visit, i only came for a quick drink with a friend to check the place out. it was a wednesday around 7pm and it was BUSY. sitting in the back booth we somehow slipped through the cracks of the bartenders orders and it took over 30 minutes to get our mere 2 cocktails. our server profusely apologized and comp'd the drinks.  my frustration passed with the kind apology and even more so with a sip of my "Ocean Side" gin cocktail. thought quite small, it was packed full of alcohol and delicious. i would definitely recommend for anyone who likes refreshing cocktails which arent overly sweet.

coming as a group of 3 or 4 and have similar tastes?  GET THE PUNCH BOWL. this is quite possibly the most ingenious creation in the classy bar setting, and the most economical too, as it is easily 2-3 full drinks for the price of 1 specialty cocktail from the menu. although you are sticking to one drink for the evening... when it is as delicious as the "Pimm's Berry Punch" was, there were no complaints at all. such a beautiful creation, and i love the giant frozen ice layered in fruit. a drink you also eat, it was in perfect balance with a lovely kick of ginger (you definitely must like ginger to enjoy this drink). pinkies up as you sip this dangerous beverage via tea cup. obviously the punch bowl is only attainable if you get a table -- we came on a sunday around 5:30 and had our pick of tables (actually moved from the back to an opening table in the front area next to the window, which, once the sun set below the top windows was quite perfect and very summer-y.)

as a shared establishment with soda & swine next door, you get full range of food ordering; the best of both worlds. and my goodness, all the food being brought out to neighboring guests looked AMAZING. i simply gush over those cute cast iron skillets. cant wait to come back with an appetite.

i envision many future visits to polite provisions...and im pretty sure it is here to stay a very long time.<//text>

Crowded but has a nice atmosphere. Don't eat their food with bread if you're allergic to Sourdough.</review>

<Time>1408467160100<//Time><text>Fernet Branca on tap!! Wow, that is really impressive. I'm not sure how they procured that but it is definitely unique. Looks like Polite Provisions wants to give San Diego Fernet consumption a bump, maybe we will catch up to the San Franciscans who are apparently 25% of United States' Fernet consumption (I was really excited about this elixir when I first drank it.. lost a night on wikipedia hence the nerd-out numbers-style).

OK, aside from the mental fireplace of a fernet experience.. PP raises the bar for bars on Adams. This is no dive. The full windows surrounding the front of the house is great for those of us who loath going into a dark bar when there is still glorious beautiful sunlight outside. I love the decor. Its not over the top even though its fancier than most 'hip' establishments. I can tell they probably found some of their accent pieces at an architectural salvage type of place. I love the detail.

It's really cozy in the back of the bar and as a super bonus.. collaboration with the mini slider establishment next door. . Soda & Swine. DELICIOUS food.< /text><pics>None<//pics></record></dataset><record>

This past Sat. The short blond girl with a poney tail who was working the front left side of the establishment was rude and a terrible waittress. Very slow and inaccurate service. I won't ever go back.</review>

<review>Parking is an absolute disaster in this area, but this spot has a cozy, old-timey feel complete with 'oil paint' portraits and little flame lamps at the tables. Try a Zombie, it'll give you a real kick and then a nice, mellow liquorice bite at the end. There's something real special about this place, from the fast service down to the monogrammed ice cubes.< /review>< Pictures>
