< review>
Stayed on Venice beach for a 2 day stay and wanted some late night eats. Made it a half hour before close and they were so nice in still accommodating us. Ordered their Combination Fried Rice. Absolutely amazing presentation and some of the best fried rice ive ever had. My mate had their curry and only had good things to say. Highly recommend this place if your visiting or living nearby looking for good food.< /review>

Food is delicious. 5 stars. But...

Minus one star because I've only got a 50% success rate of getting "very spicy" when I order. Tonight I specified max spicy, saw "2 stars" on the receipt when I picked up my order, then got home to find no chili in my dish whatsoever. I got more of a burn from my piping hot soup than I did from my main dish.

Please. When I say "extra spicy" I MEAN IT. Don't give me Midwestern White Guy spicy. It's enough to make me stop ordering.<//Text>

<Review>This place used to be my favorite Thai spot, but they renovated during the pandemic and added a new seating area and it appears that they cannot keep up with the increase of dine in customers.  I have ordered from here 3 times in the past month and every time it takes at least twice as long as the wait time they give you.  The first time I went back it took an hour and 20 minutes for egg rolls and a noodle dish (they were packed I will give them that) the second time I went back I gave them an extra 10 min until I drove over to get my food and they forgot to put in my order they said it will be ready in 10 minutes, I come back and they forgot to put in my order the second time as well, making me wait around an hour and a half again, for egg rolls and a noodle dish, this last time I went they gave me a 30 minutes wait time, I came 30 min late anticipating the super long wait, and still had to wait another 30 min in the restaurant so it took them an another hour and a half to make my food and they skimped me on an egg rolls on top of all of that, once again this place used to be my favorite Thai place, but because of these experiences I’ve had since the remodel I cannot say that I will be returning even though the food is amazing I cannot deal with the wait times being 3X longer than they tell me and skimping me on top of all of it.  Hope you guys can get it together at some point.< /Review></record>

One of the better restaurants in the Venice area. Charming location on the canals. Often a wait on weekend nights. My favorites here are the spicy steak salad and the curries.< /Review>

We went in June 2020 for a family vacation. Stayed close by as we wanted to walk to the beach, and the pier and then we found this gem right near the beach. We actually ate here twice as the food was so good and the drink selection was solid. Service was good but not outstanding.

I ordered the fried calamari, fried rice, coconut shrimp and tom yum soup. The portions and the food was very disappointing especially for the price.  Not much flavor. I've been recommended this place by my godmother especially since I live so close. I'm sorry to say I won't be returning.< /review>

Small restaurant next to the Venice Canals. Food was excellent! I'm giving it a 4 because only outdoor seating is available. Umbrellas provide shade. The green curry was nice and rich , not watered down. And their papaya salad and angel wings were flavorful and delicious as well!</text>

Excellent service and quality!

The menu was clean and organized. Finally a menu with lots of nice pictures of foods. Excellent and so helpfulI. I wish other restaurant's menu could have more pictures.

The staff were kind and helpful.

As we entered in to the restaurant during lunch time, many visitors were there to eat.

We were quickly helped to sit down at a table and right away and another waitress came to receive our order.

We ordered several different dishes. The food were hot, fresh and tasted excellent!

The amount of salt in the food was ok but the amount of sugar in salads and other dishes were more than expected. We wish the sugar could be less and they could serve some sugar at side so the customer themself can decide how much sugar they want to add.

The waiting time from order to be served was ok.

The restroom:
We didn't see any restroom. Does this place have restroom?

Here are some pictures I took.</Text>

Very good Thai food with wonderful service. Tasty dishes, including lots of less common ones. Mostly outdoor seating, hence the name "Garden- so dress accordingly if it's cold (they do have heat lamps). Not sure what they do when it rains!<//Review>

What a wonderful place.  We stopped here after touring the Venice Canal houses.  We had the Krispy Ka Prao Chicken and the Roasted Duck Curry with a side of white, steamed rice.

First, the ambiance is just amazing. We sat outside, our table overlooking the canal, a fresh breeze lightly blowing in on a warm and sunny winter day.

The chicken was tender, falling off the bone, with a sticky, crispy skin and crispy basil. I probably could have eaten another entire serving.  The curry had a beautiful kick of spice to it and the duck was tasty.

The service was great too.  The server kept our water glasses full and checked in on us several times.

We would definitely return here again.<//text>

<rate>3<//rate><Review>The food here is fantastic but the service can be somewhat inattentive. We waited more than 15 minutes for cutlery that never came even after we asked for it. I ended up getting some myself. No one offered us water when our glasses were empty. Having said that, this is still my favourite Thai restaurant in LA. It's reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>Where to begin, this restaurant was conveniently located to the Inn at Venice beach. The service is friendly and go out of their way to help with dietary restrictions. I was able to order salmon larb and Thai iced tea with coconut milk instead of cream based. Everything was delicious and served in a timely manner. I also appreciate the fact that I didn't need a reservation. I highly recommend this restaurant.<//Review><GmapID>0x80c2baa2c1ad9729:0xe8c4b9f601081a5f<//GmapID></record>

A great mini restaurant, great food and great service. I recommend two plates: 1. Thai soup whit seafoods 2. Phat Thai noodles, simply spectacular with a great atmosphere The beer is wonderful and the Te too. Not conventional food but simply delicious. I recommend too the Thai Ice Te and after lunch you can walk between the Venice canals.<//text>

Considering I was the only one at the restaurant when I got there for lunch, the service was very slow. I had the pad Thai and the sticky rice with mango for dessert: the pad Thai was forgettable - nothing about it would make me want to try it again or make a strong recommendation for it. The rice from the sticky rice with mango was clearly undercooked. In all, if you are in the area and want Thai food, consider looking elsewhere.</text>

If you're used to average establishment then this is an okay choice. The food is good and it's reasonably priced, go to service in basic cafeteria service they do not go the extra mile. The Waitresses barely speak English and just take your order and bring you your food you never see them again.<//review>

< Review>
Superb, authentic Thai food. We cook and travel internationally a lot and are choosy about where we eat, but this restaurant was so good we ate here two days in a row.

For salads, we loved the glass noodle salad as well as the papaya salad (Som Tum). The Siamese Hot Pot Delight soup is delicious and lovely. The Deep Sea Diamond from the specialty menu was also great. Even the mango sticky rice had a special touch. Oh, and their fresh coconuts are delicious! Very fresh.

The patio is lovely in good weather and they have kind service.< /Review>

Food was very good; nice outdoor atmosphere but our waiter today???!! Not sure what his trip was but what a POOR attitude 😡😡. Just in case he doesn’t know: we are the customer & would appreciate at least a modicum of enthusiasm that we were at your restaurant 🤔🤔.</review>

<Review>Hidden, small and nice Thai style restaurant right at the end of Venice Canals.
Pretty quite of Saturday afternoon, enjoying the sunset.
Dishes arrived quickly, all of them were great and to our taste.
Price reasonable too!

<text>Amazing place! I got the pineapple fried rice and my wife got the #2 pad see ew. The rice there is amazing and the pad see ew comes with flat noodles and they were great. We both got beef so not sure on the other meats but it was fantastic. The service was eh just two people handling busing and serving so we only had two interactions he took our order for food and drink and the food being brought and we found them for the check. Food though was five stars!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><userid>111408362925094910244<//userid><Gmap_id>0x80c2baa2c1ad9729:0xe8c4b9f601081a5f</Gmap_id><username>Jordon Valenzuela< /username>< Rating>

A bit pricey but the food is delicious. Ordered a papaya salad(requested spicy, but came medium spicy for my taste), beef satay came in 5 little skewers(11.95), eggplant with tofu and sweet and sour beef and a large rice (5$).< /Review>

Food is 5 stars but the service is 0. No eye contact, fake smiles. We ask for mild rice for the children, and they made it extremely spicy. It was ridiculous. Take away maybe? Because delicious food.</review>

This is not a glamorous place and could probably use some updating but it is always tidy and the bathroom clean. Super convenient if you want to walk the canals or after hanging out at mother's or Venice Beach.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

<text>2/12/2021 Update: Got the drunken noodles again, and they were much better and way more flavorful. And the service was much better too! Updating the rating to 4 stars.

Slow and inattentive service. Charged extra for rice when you order curry (although that might be a thing at Thai restaurants out here). That's like charging for noodles when you order spaghetti. Bland drunken noodles. Seems like a tourist trap.<//text>< time>

Great little place right on the side of the canals walkway. Seated in a timely manner outside. The staff was hurrying around and doing their job. We ordered 2 entrees, this is where the problem started. My Pad Thai arrived in about 10 minutes, quick for how busy they were however my guest ordered the Emerald Curry arrived 15 minutes after mine. When questioned about this the staff had no excuse and just said sorry. This to me is totally unacceptable and a total failure on the front and back of house communication. The food was great, the timing was terrible.<//review>

<Text>The portions are small, but delicious. Very cozy place, but there is some indoor seating. Don't come here if you have plans for later on a weekend though; they are often short-staffed and I've been here enough times to say that you will be here at minimum 1.5 hours.</Text>< date>

<Review>I love the food here. If it’s super busy you will need to wait but for the price and location and yummy level you get to suck it up.
I go back at least once a week!!<//Review><UserId.>117779534564761680853</UserId.>< Date>

Was meeting family here for lunch today (Mother's Day). My daughter and I waited  by the entrance but no one greeted us. While my family was finding parking, I took my daughter, who has a medical condition, to use the restroom. I'm waiting outside the restroom and this server runs up to me and YELLS at me that the restroom is for customers only. I told her we were customers but the rest of the party was parking. She continued to YELL at me that I should have waited and should have asked before going to the bathroom. After she finished yelling I called my family and told them we couldn't eat there because we felt so unwelcome. Who does that? I get it, you're not a public bathroom but we were customers who were never greeted and to yell at a child and her parent for using the restroom, please. Get over yourself lady. It's not that serious. Never going back again<//Text>

Stumbled across this little gem whilst on a stroll back to the hotel from Venice beach. Delicious food and excellent service! I got the drunken noodles and they were to die for, just the right level of spice! Nice quirky outdoor setting.< /review>

Fine Thai food but nothing out of the ordinary. It's pretty well priced but the portions are rather small and it takes a while to get the food out after ordering. I would come back if I were in the area but would not make a special trip for it.</Text>

Was looking forward to a romantic dinner in this small intimate restaurant. A total disaster!! My husband's food arrived, and after 20 minutes of waiting for my dinner, I finally asked the waiter in charge about my dinner. He informed me that the chicken I had ordered took 20 minutes and the  waitress was new, and had not informed me the wait. I told him she should not have brought my husband's dinner way before mine was ready! I did not receive my dinner, and eventually asked the waiter to cancel my order as my husband was finished eating. I asked for something already prepared and choose the chicken sticks and friedrice. I received a huge mound of rice and 4-5 chicken sticks. My original order had not been removed from the bill! We finally settled the bill and it was $20.00 for my part, which was 4-5 chicken sticks and some refried rice. No comp was given for the long delay!! Would never go back to that restaurant!!< /review>

Beautiful outdoor seating and delicious food for what was on the menu. Only complaint would be for them to expand options for some.mor viarty & add additional traditional thai food dishes to their delicious options already available.< /Text>

Unique for the reason that we have never eaten Thai food that tasted that bad before. Quick service, though not as quick as our regret in our choice of restaurants.< /text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) After admiring the canal, we walked into this lovely Thai restaurant to have a meal. We sat in an outdoor location, surrounded by beautiful plants, and we could enjoy fireworks while eating.
We ordered fried shrimp, fried chicken wings, spring rolls, fried rice, green curry and Thai rice, which were unexpectedly delicious! The waitress was very enthusiastic to ask whether our spicy level was acceptable, the service was great and delicious, and a family of four left with a full meal

欣賞完運河，走進這間可愛的泰國餐廳用餐，我們坐在戶外的位置，周圍種滿了各種植物很美，一邊吃飯還可以欣賞到煙火。
我們點了炸蝦、炸雞翅、春卷、炒飯、綠咖哩和泰國米，出乎意料之外很好吃喔！服務小姐很熱心詢問我們的辣度能否接受，服務很棒也好吃，一家四口吃得飽飽的離開</Text>< pics>

<Pics>None</Pics><Text>Very comfortable! Unquestionably professional in operation, homey in comfort. No other automotive service shop comes close to offering what I found here, it was like going to dad's to get the work done. Totally 5 stars with 2 thumbs up and a smile! I wouldn't hesitate to advertise or recommend DownTown Smog again and again! Be prepared, they have awesome sculptures, art and a clothing line by Proton showing in there from locals that is worth a view and is available for purchase.</Text>< rating>

Always in and out pretty quick. Prices are reasonable. Kind of a weird vibe with the random cat and a very unusual collection of furniture and house accessories, but the owner is pretty cool. We bring all our cars here every time it's time to get a smog check on each of them. They must be doing something right because we keep coming back. 😊<//text>

I went to do a smog check in a Thursday morning. The service is completed quickly. Staff was nice. The online coupon was honored. No complaints. I won't say it is a very clean and neat place with nice furniture, but it is acceptable. Most of all, if a maintenance shop looks nice or not doesn't matter to me as long as they do the job in an efficient way.<//Text>

Quick, honest and professional would be the 3 best words to describe this place. Arrived at the shop around 2pm and was already on my way by 2:20! I had recommended this place to a few of my buddies and they were amazied on the level of knowledge this place had about getting your car to pass Smog (VERY HELPFUL)! Thank you Down Town Smog for the great service and helping me pass SMOG!!< /review>

<review>Place reeked of Marijuana! Lighting was low lit and uninviting. I had an older model car; they said their EVAP wasn't working and referred me to another location. Couldn't be more happy to take my business elsewhere. Very unprofessional.

On the plus side, Lambert Smog Station was wonderful. Ray did an excellent job and was very friendly.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

< Review>
🟩•WELLNESS•WEDNESDAY•🟩
🟩 have you ever felt guilty when eating a dish that was so delicious yet not healthy for you? That’s me a lot of the times 🙋🏻‍♂️🙋🏻‍♂️. Lucky for me, I found a perfect solution. Fresh, healthy and delicious eating can happen at the same time whenever I’m at Grabba Green in Orange, next to Main Place Mall. They made my food upon ordering using fresh ingredients with tons of greens 🥬. They even have smoothies 🍓, pressed juices 🍊 & açaí bowls 🍇. Come here so you no longer have to choose between taste and health in a meal. It’s a win-win situation 💚.

The Japanese and Mediterranean bowls at Grabbagreen Food + Juice were tasty, filling, and healthy, topped off with a slightly spicy miso sauce.  Defiintely worth purchasing.</review>

Food quality is not quite there. I spent $40 on two bowls which were half the size of a chipotle bowl..... won't be coming here anytime soon unless portion sizes and prices are more appropriate and worth your money.<//Review>

I just stopped by for a quick, delicious and healthy lunch... it’s my second time here and as delicious as the first time! I ordered the Patagonia steak bowl and it is so tasty and filling. I have to say I’m so impressed by this place that I’m going to work it into my weekly lunch spot circuit. The bowls are loaded with delicious ingredients and I can taste the freshness. The restaurant is spotless and they have awesome service. I struggled finding a healthy lunch spot and I’m so glad there’s a Grabbagreen here now! Lunch will be better from now on. I highly recommend<//review>

<review>Two stars because they TRIED to be healthy, and my juice was pretty good. However I would not say the food was fresh, veggies were limp, and the fish tasted like it had been microwaved. The ideas for the bowls are great, but poor execution. The staff acted annoyed that I was there, and 1 of them was not wearing a mask (in April 2020).< /review>< gmapID>

<Text>One of the healthiest places in Orange County to eat. Doesn't hurt that the food tastes pretty amazing on top of being good for you. Tons of stuff on the menu for anyone to enjoy even people with dietary restrictions. Easy to turn a meal into a vegan one or gluten free. Love this place.</Text></record>

I had little expectations, it's something I do to enjoy places. This place had great food, friendly staff, clean environment, recycling...Did I say the food tasted good yet? I don't eat kale, but DAMN! I ate everything off the bowl. Oh and the JUICE! I love the juice-drink! You gotta give this place a try.</Review>

Nice change and healthy ! What a great change from the hyper-processed greasy fast food. In this joint everything is good for you. Some of the smoothies have a strange taste, but I looked at the staff preparing the ingredients, and it'll all healthy stuff! Portions are just enough, staff is friendly, place is clean and roomy.</Review>

The first I came, i wasn’t too impressed with my food. The staff were friendly and explained their menu, the restaurant was clean, and the food was fresh. I wanted to give it a second try since it’s so close to my work and something told me to go back. My second visit definitely redeemed this place! I joined the rewards program and will most likely be returning on my lunch breaks.

First try: French Quarter Grain bowl
-rice very bland
-red onions very overwhelming
-for $11 I thought it would be a lot bigger and planned to keep it for leftovers. It was a lot smaller than expected, but I still finished and felt full.

Second try: On the Border Green Bowl
-lots of flavor
-this bowl seemed bigger than the grain bowl, and I ended up saving half for later. Same price as the grain bowl.

They offer bowls (create your own in available), breakfast, smoothies, juices, soups, and a kids menu (they even have a little kids table which is so cute). Indoor and outdoor seating available. A grab & go refrigerator is loaded with water, juices, snacks, and fruit. Definitely recommend!!<//text>

Amazing food, all natural, great flavor!

To the user below me, I believe you are talking about  BurgerIM right next to Grabbagreen. They are directly next to each other but are different restaurants. I believe Grabbagreen has received a unfair rating due to this.</text>

Wonderful place!!!  This was my 2nd visit.  I LOVE the choices. Super healthy but flavorful. U can make it own bowl for only $8 or choose one of theirs. It's not a huge menu. It stays true to its name, "GrabbaGreen." Mostly bowls. But lots of options. And the staff is super nice & helpful. Nizh helped me today preparing my food with care. When I leave there I have a spring in my step because the food is so good for u. I'm not a health nut but do my best. So suggest u just give it a try. They're good about giving u samples or explaining what's what if this stuff is foreign to u. Look forward to new ones opening up.<//text>

<Review>Steak hash bowl was really good, but even better with the mango sauce. Pretty pricey at $7.50 for a small bowl, but you're paying for quality.

<Review>BurgerIM Food tasted good, but kind of expensive to pay $5.00 for a small 3 oz hamburger a la carte. Its $2.00 more if you want fries. If you enjoy a very small, yet very good tasting hamburger, then this place is for you.

I don't know why Googlemaps placed the review on Grabbagreen, but this review is clearly about BurgerIM, which is next door in the same strip mall.</Review>< pics>

<text>The food is ok but it took 25 minutes to prepare two bowls for the two clients who were there the day I visited. It was almost theatrical to see them so stressed out preparing two simple bowls, can't imagine what will happen when the place is full.
Anyhow, I will give them a second chance because it's not easy finding healthy options around.</text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1551138546986, 'text': 'Thank you Andres for your feedback we definitely work on improving our service time. Look forward to seeing you next time.'}<//Resp>< gmapID>

Great ingredients and healthy meal! Had the Tokyo bay salmón a bit bland but the mango Sauce helped out the meal, not sure what a tablespoon of guacamole does to the flavor but didn’t flow with the taste of the dish, thus the 4 stars.<//Text>

I ordered the BBQ chicken subway and this location gives VERY small meat portions (about 1/2 of other locations) for the regular price. I don't appreciate that, but at least the quality of the bread was good.<//text>

Unlawful buisness practices, they tell people they will hire them through a working interview then after a week of work hard deep cleaning and lots of manual labor they find a bogus excuse to let them go and do not to pay them it is state law to pay at least a minimum wage for a working interview. Considering a lawsuit. Franchise owner preys on People who are financially poverty and collage students who believe they don't have the means to file a lawsuit against him. He also owns the 7/11 near the Belmont Veteans memorial Peir.<//text>

{'time': 1583537444328, 'text': 'Hello Robb. It is also disheartening to me to hear how the quality of service from smog busters has dropped since I sold the business in March of 2018. When I owned it, I ran it the way I would like to be treated if I was the customer. I worked very hard to be as fair as I could in all aspects of the inspection process, even going so far as to advise customers that they would fail if a sometimes small detail was not given attention first by the customer. 1999 and older vehicles need to be tested on the dyno which is a skill some shops are losing due to the new 2000 and newer vehicle tests that just require plugging into your vehicles OBD II port only. I always did my best to reply to customers who use social media to comment on their experience at smog busters, something the new owner ignores. Although it has been 2 years since I owned the business I still get notifications like this one and feel like your entitled to an answer. Thank you for expressing your honest opinion and hopefully your comments will be seen by others who will avoid the experience you had.'}</Response>

We've been taking our cars here for the last 15 + years, and everything they do is spot on. Even when I was doubtful that one of the cars i've taken to this guy, may not pass, but everytime i left smiling with a pass certificate. I have two cars going ther tomorrow & Im completely confident that I will be treated fairly. I recommend Smog Busters if you are looking for a good clean shop to take your car to get a smog certificate.< /text>

I used to send people to this place for a long time. Ever since the new owners took over and they seem to have attitudes. I came today and they failed me for a visual inspection. They stated my hose was brittle and falling apart. Took my vehicle to another star cetified smog shop (same day) and they guy checked underneath and said it was not falling apart, and it was perfectly fine.  Guess what, I passed.  I would not send Auto dealers to this place or customers. Find somewhere else to go. I will never come back to this place again.<//Text>

They asked if battery was disconnected before dropping off the car.  I told them I didn't know since I am just coming from a 35k service.  There were no followup questions to my response or any information provided how this would effect the test results.  Half an hour later I was told that the test failed because the battery had been disconnected.  They should have confirmed with me before the test that the battery had not been disconnected and what the implications were.  Nope, they were just glad to take my money without caring for their customer.  Now I have to go back again because of their poor communication.  It will be the last time.  There are plenty of other outfits that can do the smog check and have better customer service.<//text>

<Resp>{'time': 1499893752623, 'text': 'That is not exactly what transpired with this customer. This customer came to us requesting an emission\'s inspection. He stated that his car would pass the test no problem because he had just picked up his car from the dealership. We see this same scenario at least 3 to 5 times a week, so often we have a policy about it. Any time a customer states that they just picked their car from a dealership, we always ask if they disconnected the battery. We asked this customer and he had a one word answer "NO" is what he told us and when we inquired if he was sure, he became very upset and stated "why would they disconnect the battery". We are not the dealership so could not provide an answer to his statement. He never inquired about the effect that would have on his test and seemed irritated that we were even asking him about it. His vehicle passed every test we gave it, but the smog machine noted that the vehicle was not ready to be tested, because the monitors were not set. Because the customer gave us bad information, his vehicle failed. There was no lack of communication on our part as we attempted to get the information needed. . He was very adamant that the battery was not disconnected and  we took him at his word. When his vehicle failed, all of a sudden it was our fault? We ask this question at least 10 or 20 times a week, if the customer states that they just picked up their car from the dealership. Most answer "I don\'t know, can you check" and we do check. If we discover that the monitors are not set, we explain to the customer that their car is not ready to be tested and that they need to drive it, bring it back and we\'ll check it again until it is ready. By this customer telling us "NO" his battery was not disconnected we proceeded with the test.'}<//Resp><UserId.>101892249604107523885<//UserId.>< Time>

It may sound like a small oversight on the shop's part, but I hate pulling a back muscle getting into my car with the seat out of position. The other missing star is for the inspector taking way too long walking back and forth from under the hood to his reference book. I have a completely stock engine in my Ford Explorer, but this was either the first engine the guy has ever seen, or he was going out of his way determined to not let me get out of their without finding some sort of modification.</Text>< GmapID>

New convert to REI/Bay Area outdoor activities. LOVE the co-op membership and the dedication to social justice organizations. The credit card benefits are great. Store specific: good selection, obviously curated, but not always exactly what I need. But that's just me! Lots of other things (like camping supplies) I never knew about. Customer service is A+++<//Review>

Picked up a pair of ski boots there today. Staff were super nice and knowledgeable. They were very patient and detailed explaining the ins and outs of the boots. They found the best fitting pair for my feet and my special situations. I am an advanced snowboarder but beginner skier. So its best for me to go with slightly high flex, but not too high since I am not a big person. They taught me the proper way to put the boots on and how to maximize the life of them. This kind of expert advices don't exist on Amazon. In fact, for the few pairs of boots I looked at, REI's prices  are super competitive even to the internet only sellers.

The store is huge with lots of other outdoor treasures. They also sell bikes and do repairs. Tons of camping stuff.

Worth noting that their website is awesome. It's easy to browse stuff on their website, then find out if the item is in stock in the local store. Then just go there to check out the real thing and walk out with it!< /text>

<text>I love REI. I have been a member for a long time and my experience is always good. And it's practically the same in every store. They're a bit pricey but they provide superb costumer service. I recommend their "garage sale section" where they sell used equipment for a greatly reduced price.<//text>< user_id>

< Review>
Ordered a pair of hiking shoes online and went to the San Carlos location to pick it up on a Saturday afternoon. Every interaction I had from the greeter at the door to the gentleman who helped me with the fitting room to the lady at the online pick up register was nothing but phenomenal. It is a store with great customer service and I had a great experience during my short visit there.< /Review>

Bleh.  Curbside pick up, not really.  The email had requested information when I was on site.  Then asked for me to call and waited thru the messages.  Then it seemed it was still an issue until I just asked if it would be easier for me to just walk in and pick it up myself. Sad.<//review>

<review>I would like to preface with saying that I am a long time REI member and have never had a bad experience in any of their other stores. That being said, I have to give a bad review here for bad customer service and staff that were not knowledgeable.

Long story short is that they sold my fiance ski boots that wouldn't work with her skis/bindings(we even brought the skis into the store when buying boots to avoid this). We left them there for them to be tuned for safety. We got a call back saying that they weren't compatible. When we picked them up they more or less shrugged and wrote down a part number for new outsoles that we needed to source ourselves in order to make the boots work with the bindings. Not great customer service.

We did end up ordering the part directly from the manufacturer, but guess what? They were not compatible because they were 5355 outsoles, and the boots are compatible with 9523 outsoles. I figured this out after getting fed up with all the terrible advice we have been getting and went online to figure it all out for myself.

In the end, we needed to return the boots, beg for a refund from k2 for the outsoles, and find another shop to buy boots at. Props to REI for such a good return policy. That's the only reason the review is 2 stars.

We wasted a lot of time and money. The whole reason I go to a store like this is for the expert advice and to save time so I don't have to learn everything myself about ski boots and bindings compatibility. Because of the lack of knowledge and poor service I ended up learning a lot about ski boots and bindings, but I'm busy and my time means a lot to me. I hate wasting it.</review>< Pics>

<Rate>1<//Rate><review>Customer service is really terrible here. The staff walks aimlessly around this huge store and when you ask for help, the staff doesn't know their products nor do they know the location of the the product if they have heard of it. Staff tries to communicate with one another via walkie-talkie and still that's not helpful. I waited 20 minutes in an aisle waiting patiently and the salesperson who is asked to come assist me never showed up. I used another 10 minutes searching through the web and making a phone call to find an alternative location to find what I'm looking for. A young lady walk right past me and then even ask if I needed some help or if anyone has assisted me. TERRIBLE!!!
You think during a pandemic and the lack of foot traffic this company would focus on customer service. Then again I guess business is too good for them so it doesn't matter if their clients end up going down the street to their competitor, Sports Basement.<//review>< pics>

<Review>Good place to buy outdoor gear. It's beneficial only when you are their member, which is super easy and inexpensive to become.

This is one of the bigger stores in the bay area and the have a huge collection of items. The number of staff members though seems less because I usually have to find someone to help me and spend a lot of time doing just that. The staff is very helpful though at any REI location. If you have any doubt on what gear to buy, I recommend asking the staff as they will help you out by explaining the positive and negatives of any item.

I went for their garage sale in Feb 2018. I was one of the early birds to arrive at 8 am for the sale starting at 10 am. They had a fire, marshmallows, chairs, free bottles and coffee for the early birds. I thought that was super cool. The sale though had a much lesser collection. Also, they kept the garage sale items in different sections of the store instead of laying it out in the open outside which made it difficult to look for stuff.

They have ample parking outside and wheel chair accessible entrances. The store is right by the freeway.</Review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMSvM-3ANHcsKDJjUYbgal_70OjUPVCL97rJqL9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMJKO_8SkTNUX6eJBWSfZn9bPsCN8Rj-WbTF_aZ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><userid>114187353779825203543</userid>< Gmap_id>

In 2016 I bought the best shorts I've ever had from this REI store. I've worn them virtually every day since, and they finally gave out last week whilst I was on a difficult trek round a mountain in Thailand.<//Text>

I went to a lot of bike shops looking for a new bike. The guys were very attentive and had a great selection of bikes as well as knowing everything about them.

I couldn't recommend the store enough. They also give you a great deal on bike fittings and there's nearly always a sale.<//Review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I had a really positive customer service experience at this REI! I went in to get a membership and buy some gear for an upcoming backpacking trip. While they did not have a specific bear canister in stock at that location, they gave me some very helpful advice: I wanted to purchase the bear canister at the counter and drive over immediately after to a different location to pick it up. They suggested that they could instead call the other location and put it on hold, and I could pay over there - since I wanted to pick it up immediately, the few hours their system would take to process my purchase would be an issue. I agreed to this and they called the other store while processing my membership (and the $20 for $100 promo they had at this time) quickly and easily.</Text><pics>None</pics><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x808fa2143e77685d:0xe97d4e637d1de8a2< /gmapID></record>

Always seems to be really hard to get help. It is hard to track down an employee that will actually get you climbing shoes and the shoes are all in the back. Would reccomend the MV one instead or maybe sports basement?< /text>

Still a great membership driven gear shop with quality brands, but this is not a place to find casual clothes for tall men. Across all brands (including REI) and styles, the storewide number of pants with an inseam greater than 32 is ....0. Plenty of 42x32 and 38x30 if that works for you.< /text>

Went in to look at a bike that’s when I met Tom. He was super helpful! Found the bike I was looking for and set me up with all the bike things I needed (lights, spare tube, water bottle holder etc.) he had great advice on places to ride and got me more excited to go for a ride. Tom your great!< /review>

They NEED to have a separate pick up area for online orders.  Waiting over 30mins in the customer service line which barely moves. The cashier line moves faster.</Text>

Great place to get your outdoor gears. I was there looking for hiking shoes. The employees there were very friendly and helpful. I got helped by this gentleman called Walker, who knew exactly what he was talking about, and he gave me many helpful tips. Also helped me to pick the right shoes for me. So thank you!

One of the best REI locations for all your outdoor active needs. They often have great deals on apparel & accessories. I usually stop by prior to traveling abroad. Friendly & helpful staff. Easy parking.</Text>

Good selection of gears. I came here couple times although my main store is Mountain View REI, because this one had inventory of things I'm looking for. Customer service was good, and parking was easy. Just be wary of driving pattern, I circled around couple times to figure out how to get back to hwy 101</review>

<review>Definitely get the REI membership if you want to purchase anything. Lots of discounts, and you are able to make exchanges and refunds if you change your mind about any items. Staff here are super nice and helpful. No need to say anything about their product selections - high quality and durable stuff.<//review>< user>

<review>I  love REI and usually have fantastic customer service experiences. The location in San Carlos however was the worst REI service I’ve encountered. I waited for help with bike racks for more than 30 minutes and was asked if my question was going to be a quick one. If I’m about to drop a grand on a roof system and two bike racks of course I’m going to need some help and would expect the professionals at REI to be accommodating. In addition to the wait in the bike center, I tried the customer service line. I was behind one other individual and gave up after another 15 minutes with no help to either one of us. Disappointed and will not be going back to this location</review>< Pictures>

I generally really like this store however, a few years ago I purchased a REI brand rain jacket and now the inner lining is flaking off and makes me look like I have dandruff! Customer service won't do anything for me. Should have bought a NorthFace as they guarantee their products for life!</review>

The staff helping us get boots for my son's backpacking trip were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. We learned a lot from them. The 1-year return policy for boots is pretty amazing and takes the fear out of such a purchase. A couple of the clothing items we wanted weren't in stock in his size, but they ordered them for us with free shipping to our home address. This branch of REI (San Carlos) seems better run than the Mountain View one where I had trouble getting any help and the staff didn't seem to know anything about choosing boots.<//review>

A nice REI and a little bigger than the Mountain View store. Staff is friendly and very helpful. The location is a little odd and parking is pretty limited so you usually have to park around the corner.<//text>

Waited almost an hour for a bike to be prepped for a test ride - but they forgot about me standing there!  Nobody approached me, despite reps walking around.

This lack of service wasn't due to one person, it required #teamwork

I had already sat on the bike - it
just needed tweaks.  They took my ID,  asked me to wait. I finally asked after almost an hour, and they had no idea I was waiting.   They also didn't have the bike ready.  They were nice, and said "sorry for the wait", so 2 stars instead of 1.  They should have at least offered some expedited service, given the situation, and maybe I would have stayed. I didn't feel like scheduling a test drive for later.

fault 1:  They dropped the ball.
fault 2:  Staff never approached me to  ask.  I was within eyesight of the front checkout as well as the bike desk as I waited in the aisle.
fault 3:  When they found out, they didn't even try to find a way to make things better.< /text>

All the associates are extremely helpful and seem to be extremely knowledgeable. I personally came to look for parts for my fixed gear bicycle which they (at no fault of their own) didn't have. Seems more geared towards road/mtb. Decent place to grab generic things for your bicycle (tubes, locks, tools, etc.)< /Review>

REI is an amazing place to go for all sorts of camping, sporting and just fun equipment. It has so many interesting things that even my kids enjoy shopping there. The staff is always friendly and helpful, many of them are quite knowledgeable and can help select the right sleeping bag, tent, etc.

Prices are a bit higher than other places, but the quality of the products and the expertise of the staff are well worth the added premium. And with membership, it's possible to get some of that back every year...<//review>

Went in to trade in a backpack I bought on the weekend and although I was happy to explore the options John was keen to help me as well as helping 2 other folks in the area simultaneously. He deftly moved among us answering questions and making suggestions without making any of us feel rushed or ignored.</review>

<Text>If you need outdoor gear REI is a great place to start. The store is well laid out and the employees generally well versed in the products. However, if you are looking for a specialty item you likely have to look elsewhere. Lines to check out can be long particularly duri the holidays.< /Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>It sucks because I love the concept of this store and the staff are super knowledgeable and helpful. They helped cater the gear that I needed to finish my backpacking and hiking kits. From stoves to sleeping pads, these employees knew their stuff.

However, I finally found the perfect sleeping bag, called in to a store that had it, and had them hold it. When we arrived, the store couldn't find the bag, and no locations within 30 miles had it in stock. Very upsetting, but they price matched a more expensive bag to make up for it.</Text><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

Concerns:
1. Lack of knowledgeable staff.  I'm 10 years from up to date on outdoor gear, so at REI I should be able to get more information than "I can scan that item for you and get you the price."
2. Sale person lecturing a customer about politics (Camelbac products related to a parent company that also owns hunting equipment)
3. Sales floor covered in apparel to such a degree that finding gear is difficult.  Used to be that there where standards at REI about the % that was dedicated to gear...no more.</review><gmap_id>0x808fa2143e77685d:0xe97d4e637d1de8a2</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Great selection of high-quality products, and a friendly, knowledgable staff to assist with any questions you may have. Conveniently located just off HWY 101 and halfway between San Francisco and San Jose. Parking can be a little tight, especially during events like garage sales and the annual sale.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Always love REI, as it's my go to place for everything outdoors. Bought my first climbing shoes, harness, climbing rope, and tent from REI.

The staff are knowledgeable of their products and outdoor activities. Member garage sales are adventures in themselves.<//text>

<Review>50/50. First staffer  seemed more interested in his cell phone than in my needs.  Found another  assistant and she was great, knowledgeable, helpful and not reluctant to search the store and also help me adjust a daypack.
Same with customer service, first clerk said she would be right back and went off with the customer ahead of me. She never returned and became involved with another customer. The clerk who remained at  the  counter eventually  was available and served me well.
Never was assistance offered when I was trying to select hiking poles, nor was anyone visible to assist during the 10 to 15 minutes I spent at the rack.
I still like REI and San Carlos is so much less chaotic  than my local Berkeley store!
Thanks, Elena<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

<review>I love going to REI for my expedition necessities, however I find it frustrating that everytime I step foot into the store, there is never an employee to help me find what I need or answer my questions. This always ends up leading me to just settle for something (which is also frustrating because with such high prices, settling is a risk for the wallet) or leave the store empty handed; feeling like I wasted my time.<//review>< Resp>

<review>Went here to get a pair of shoes and i had one of the staff through with me several different options. I had originally thought that a certain brand did not fit me but the staff person told me that there was an option of wide sizing which may have been the problem and low and behold!

<Review>I came here to buy some hiking boots for a trek. Looking confused in the shoe section, I was quickly approached by a staff member who asked me a bunch of questions about my trek and specifics about my feet. He took measurements and we seriously went through about 10 different pairs of shoes to narrow down which brand and fit worked best. Each round of shoes got better and better until we found the absolute perfect Vasque boots. Yes, REI is overpriced, especially when it comes to shoes. But honestly I'm completely OK paying extra for the service. They worked to find me the right shoe, not to up-sell me to something to make higher commission, like other stores. I've since become a member and am coming back here for all my outdoors needs!</Review>< Name>

< Review>
The ATM was down and the banker was behind me and watched me try to withdrawal and nothing came out. He made a comment saying “nothing came out huh” and went inside the closed bank. The transaction processed and now I have to make a claim to have access to my OWN money. They said after midnight I’ll see my funds back. What a mess, the guy could’ve warned me, put a sign up, given me the money from inside since it processed. I will be taking my banking elsewhere from now on.</Review>

<Text>Huge line, almost an hour. This is a bank that does not care about its customers. Bank of America sucks. Bank of America steals. I put a stop on a check, they charged me $30 then 2 weeks later paid the check. This bank is awful.

15 people waiting and 2 tellers working, go to Chase people.
I am here doing a favor for somebody.
Never again.
Their Castro Location was closed and it says it in very Small letters.
It's Friday, what's wrong with these guys?< /Review>

I have accounts with BofA but do my best to avoid what is usually an awful bank. I needed a birth certificate application notarized so I decided to try out their free notary service for customers. But... of course they refuse to notarize those.

BofA is truly among the worst banks. If I didn't occasionally use their credit cards, I would never step foot there.< /text>

There are 11 teller windows, and in the year I've been going there on a monthly basis, I've only ever seen 3 of them open at once. Even if you come in and are first in line, be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes no matter what. When I was there last and waiting, I saw employees fiddling around with the recycling bins behind the glass as though they had nothing better to do. If they don't hire more tellers, they should be prepared to see more people go online or visit other branches.< /review>

<Text>The staff here are very helpful and the bank has a large number of ATMs outside for cash deposit and retreival operation. Carrying out any activity in this bank in person is quiet smooth but having a prior appointment is something which you keep in mind if you don't want to wait.< /Text><pics>None< /pics>< response>

Definitely one of the worst branches among all bank of america banks, which has a record in poor service among other banks itself. I have to wait 3*x longer for most of transactions. Once I had to wire money to a person having account with them and the cashier could not do this for me. I had to wait 45 minutes for a banker to do a simple wire transaction for me.
Terribly poor service and zero respect for day-day customers. Never come back to bank of america.<//review>

Hi this is Stan, have been dealing with this branch for over a year. The difference between them and the Scott Avenue branch in Santa Clara is incredible. My experience at Mountain View has always been positive and friendly. The manager Safet goes out to his way to greet people and has helped me numerous times. I know that this is a training branch and there is a high turnover of tellers and never once have I had a negative experience. 5 star rating.</Text>

No complaints about this BofA location, other than it looks dated inside.  And also the bulletproof partition separating the tellers from the customers makes me think what went down here in the past.  The only reason I come here is because it’s close to work.  All the employee I’ve dealt with there have been very professional and helpful.< /Text>

I waited 25 minutes to cash a check at this location. The teller said she needed to get manager verification. I've been standing here and waiting just to get one cash check for 25 minutes. If I could give it to zero stars I would.I asked a bank representative if he could check to see why it's taking so long he said he had an appointment. Wouldn't even get up from his chair. Worst bank ever.</review>

<rate>3< /rate><review>Pretty decent place. It's always crowded. There is no AC. Food is decent as well. I ordered the duck noodles.

The lettuce wasn't fresh though so I didn't eat any of it. And the noodles were super oily. Ratio of noodles to meat was super overwhelming for me since I don't eat too much. But the duck meat was very tender and well prepared. Also, pretty pricey for noodles. At most $8 for a small bowl.</review>< pics>

<rate>3< /rate><text>I'm normally not a fan of mi (yellow noodles)

but this location is a whole lot better than their other ones.  I came here with my parents for lunch on a Sunday.  There was only 2 other parties inside and we were seated immediately.  I ended up going for hu tieu instead of mi (white noodles instead of yellow) with thin sliced beef.  They had a large variety of different noodles with different types of meats.  You can also get a side order of extra beef for only $2 bowl.  Only $2 for a whole huge bowl!  That's cheap.  Everyone seemed to enjoy their food.

Our orders came out super fast.  The inside is a lot cleaner than their other locations but the layout is weird.  It looks like it use to be smaller and they expanded.  They're an extra room in the very back and that was where we sat.  For 4 bowls of noodles, it was only $24.< /text>< Pictures>

My interpretation of the dish is basically chow mein in a pretty pho dress. Good food for the price.

The only downside is that the dish doesn't come with many greens, only lettuce and green onion. Throw in some sliced onion or cilantro, maybe even some garlic. I'd be more than happy to give 4 stars then!< /Text><time>1469552265303<//time><resp>None</resp>< Name>

Mi Lay Cay  has been serving Chinese Vietnamese "mi" noodles in Orange County since the 80s. Mi noodles are freshly made. Food is consistently good and cheap! This location has a crowded lot so come  off hours.</review>

<Review>I was visiting Antioch with my aunt and happen to stumble on this little gem. Tucked away in the Lone Tree shopping plaza, Vine and Grain boost a impressive selection of wine and beer for a very reasonable price. Although seating can be limited (we arrived during a peak time), it was certainly worth the wait. They have a fabulous sparkling flight, and a small menu of tapas. Would recommend this place for a small group to unwind and catch up. Modern atmosphere with a small town feel, and solid service.<//Review>< Pictures>

This place is way overpriced they are charging 38 dollars for a bottle of wine that goes in stores for 12 bucks. Although the scenery is nice the prices for what you get are way to overpriced be aware.<//Text>

<rating>2<//rating><review>The service was friendly but the wine prices are ridiculous with a moscato bottle that's online for 12.95 and it is 38 in the restaurant/bar. The markup on food and drinks is ridiculous for even restaurant standards. Will not be back.</review>< Gmap_id>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I love this sexy wine bar!  My girlfriends and I met for lunch right when they opened today.  We chose to sit on their couches instead of the wine barrel tables.  I wanted to relax and put my feet up.  They also have seating outside for you sun goddesses.

We decided to order a little of everything.  They're small plates (2-4 items).  We had the juicy mouth watering soft tacos.  Those by far were my favorite!  We also ordered the garlic bread.  It had a special mixture of mayo and parmesan cheese.  I'm not a big mayo fan!  We ended with balsamic cherry tomatoes on slices of sourdough bread.  Those were also tasty!

I had the Frank Family Zinfandel.  Frank Family is one of my favorites.  Their Zin is easy on the stomach! They carry mostly local brands.  There's a lot of grape growers in Oakley, Brentwood and Lodi.  Rest decor

The unisex bathroom is unique.  I like the decor.   I even took some pictures.  Overall, it's a cozy wine bar with a great ambiance.  I definitely recommend!<//text>< Pics>

<review>Updating a year later and this place is still great post-covid. Nice food selection with wine and feel safe with friendly & professional staff.

old review:
I have dinner and appetizers quite a bit next store at Attraversiamo which is always good, but recently discovered the pleasure of going back and forth between the two.

I felt like a glass of wine last week and went over and received some great recommendations after describing the type of Cab I like with a great cheese plate. Went back a few times and described the wine since of course i never remember and was taken care of. Everyone is knowledgeable and friendly, with a great atmosphere for socializing or watching the game.

Pick this place with confidence as you can't go wrong with the small foods and great wine<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x808ff8dea2cb69a9:0xabf5a4a9d1bb477f</GmapID></record>

Their outdoor area is really nice and relaxing- like a rooftop bar but you, in Brentwood. I would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for tapas and drinks.</text>< pics>

<Text>This is like a little slice of Napa close to home. I love the outdoor patio with sofas & firepits. The happy hour features a nice malbec and a fresh and flavorful bruscetta.<//Text><Name>Jill Cooper<//Name>< Rating>

<rate>5< /rate><text>The first thing you notice when you walk in the office is that the entire staff is very polite and very welcoming. The doctor is supported by an extremely knowledgeable staff and all are very thorough in explaining whatever procedure you’re scheduled for. I was very vocal about being anxious about getting the implant and every staff member went out of their way to make sure that I felt at ease during the process. That type of attention and care is priceless. I highly recommend this place!</text>< pictures>

The entire staff is very professional, pleasant and polite. I absolutely love the dental assistants & Dr. Deragopian! They took the time to explain the procedure. Dr. Deragopian numbed me correctly and that meant the world to me. I’ve had some bad and painful experiences. Upon completion, everything was ready to go. The front office staff are very knowledgeable & efficient. My return appointment was scheduled before I was taken to the back so that when I was done with my procedure, I was able to exit and be on my way so that I could get home and rest. I appreciate their services and their kindness.<//review>

<Review>The team was Brentwood Oral Surgery was amazing from start to finish. I got my 4 wisdom teeth removed, with one of them being heavily damaged by cavities,  and they explained all the affects of wisdom tooth neglect, the benefits of removal, broke down the price, and were very accommodating to my questions. Not once did I feel uninformed or nervous about what was happening. The staff is super friendly, fun to talk to, and very knowledgeable. Doctor Deragopian was very professional and kind, not to mention quick with executing the operation. I layed down, relaxed, closed my eyes, opened them again and was finished! Amazing experience! Highly highly recommend!</Review><GmapID>0x808fff500ccfdb75:0x74d08caccb6bb8e1< /GmapID>< Rate>

<Review>The entire staff was incredible.  Very professional but yet comforting.  Every step was explained clearly with much detail.  I will never say I enjoyed the shots, but I will say this office made it as pleasant as possible.  Hardly even felt them.  Thank you for that. As for the procedure....the same.  If I hadn't been given step by step updates, I never would have known that my tooth was already extracted.  Over all experience, awesome.  Would highly recommend this office.< /Review>< Pics>

What a great place! From the moment I walked in I felt welcomed and taken care of. Jen took great care of me and Dr. Deragopian explained everything very thorough and got me in and out! Everyone made sure I was comfortable at all times. Thank you for making getting a tooth extracted not so bad 😁<//Text>

I must say that even with the stress of losing a tooth I felt  comfortable. Bonnie and Tina are awesome, they stood next to me and even held my hand through some of the more difficult times during my visit.
I don't like losing anything and especially my tooth, but if I ever need another extraction I'm coming back here....< /text>

They did an excellent job with my wisdom teeth surgical procedure! Between squeezing me in at the last second, and making sure I have everything I need for my recovery, they really outdid themselves. They made me feel very comfortable before the procedure. By the time I knew it, I was sitting in my recliner at home. Excellent staff and excellent service! Highly recommend them for any of your oral surgical needs.< /review>

Spectacular experience at Brentwood Oral Surgery !!!
100% Pain free !!!
I was well informed of all procedures in detail, & all follow up appointments.
The Doctor & Assistants work well together, providing a comfortable experience.
My specific orthodontist assistant was Jamie, & i was delighted by her charm, care, & professionalism.

The office is organized, sanitized, & "spic N span" clean ...
Even something as grueling as getting a tooth pulled, is a "walk in the park", at Brentwood Oral Surgery !<//text>

<text>I had such an amazing experience. I had my wisdom tooth pulled. They gave me general anesthesia. Before giving it, they prepped my hand with lidocaine before starting the IV to give the anesthesia. The fact that they made sure that I was always comfortable and felt no pain, meant the world to me. Everyone was so nice. When they were all done and I woke up. I was so happy. I highly recommend this place.</text><gmapID>0x808fff500ccfdb75:0x74d08caccb6bb8e1< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>I was nervous about the procedure of getting 2 implants put in. Bonnie and Dr. Deragopian put my mind at ease and assured me it was very well tolerated and not a big deal. Man were they right. I prefer the implants over getting a filling or root canal. I didn't feel a thing and everything was explained before the procedure and during. Before i knew it, we were done. Very quick and painless. Now i  am recovering per their instructions<//Review>< Pictures>

The staff, including Jenise, Bonnie, Jennifer, and Dr Deragopian, DMD, MD, were all excellent. Having an unplanned procedure done can be nerve wracking.  Not here. They know what you are going through and do their very best to keep you informed every step of the way.
Even during this 2020 pandemic, they kept me safe and at ease. They answered my questions, kept me informed as they went through the procedure. They were also kind to each other. Something you don’t always see. Each member of the staff supported each other and treated each other with respect. A real team environment.
All this on less than 24 hours notice.  They were there for me when I needed them.</review>

Dr. and his staff are fabulous! I struggle with anxiety and was very stressed out to have my procedure done. They took excellent care of me from beginning to end, no pain or stress at all! . I highly recommend the office of Dr. Deragopian.< /text>

Went in last week to get my wisdom teeth removed which for most can be pretty scary for most! Let me just say they made me feel sooo relaxed and comfortable that I’m now considering getting all of my teeth pulled just to have another great experience😁 all jokes aside, very friendly and upbeat office. I’ve been going here for years despite me living in San Francisco, the drive is so worth knowing your in good hands. Dr. Dikran does amazing work. The assistant are wonderful as well, especially Taylor Sealy! I wish I knew all of they’re names by heart, but they truly go over and beyond to take care of you! Thank you guys soo much for everything!<//Text>

< Review>
I am very happy 😊 with this Dr's office. The level of care ❤ I received from this great team, has warmed my heart. They went above and beyond what I could of asked for.  I was well-informed throughout the hole process. Dr. Deragopian made my decision easy for me by providing all the options and going over the pros and cons. After my last visit I felt sad, 😥because I was all done and I had no more teeth for them to fix. If I ever need a tooth fixed I know where to go. Thank you Bonnie, Pearl, Jamie, Janece, Tina and Dr. Deragopian. 🥰🤩</Review>

I have nothing but praise for Brentwood Oral Surgery and Impact Center. DR Deragopian and his staff are amazing. Dr Deragopian explained the procedure to my somewhat different problem and gave me realistic expectations. Janece in front office is very welcoming, doing a great professional job during this taxing Covid time. Heather went above and beyond, working with my insurance and Bonnie and Jamie, Dr D’s surgical assistants, are incredibly efficient, compassionate and caring. Highly recommended.</review>

Referred by my primary dentist for wisdom tooth extraction, I must say I anticipated a less than pleasant experience; however, the staff here proved me wrong :). From appointment scheduling, to insurance verification, consultation, etc. everything was easy and smooth thus far. The ladies in office were super friendly and prompt with service. My actual extraction procedure is scheduled for a later date but I must say I am honestly not as worried, I know I'll be in good hands. The doctor was very detailed and thorough with his explanation of the procedure. The ladies did great at explaining preparation and follow-up. Lastly, but certainly not least the cost is affordable. I'd definitely recommend for all your oral hygiene needs, these people are LEGIT :) :) :)</text>

My son had to go here to have all his wisdom teeth pulled. They were under the gums still and by a nerve. So that's why his dentist didn't do it. They put him to sleep. He woke up not remembering anything. Recovery went real well for him. I had issues with the insurance. Heather who works there was amazing helping me with the insurance and to get things all straightened out. It took a long time for the insurance to do their part (many months). Heather kept on them and kept me informed. They are really nice over there and I really appreciate all that was done for me and my son!< /Review>

This is probably my first review ever i don't usually take the time to do these kind of things , but ive been calling and leaving voicemails for 2 days and nobody picks up or returns my calls how busy can they be? I went to Marsh creek dental because iam in severe pain due to my wisdom teeth and i saw Dr. Kumar , him & his staff are great however they referred me to this oral surgeon since my tooth is to close to the nerve. I understand the oral surgeon may not be available right away but does he not have a front desk person who can answer or return my call?? Anyway not going to call again im looking for another oral surgeon. Not even the most high class & busiest place takes this long to answer atleast one time!<//Text>

They staff was very nice and assure me they would be there for me and it won't be that bad. As for the actual dentist guy, he very nice also and professional. And he's not a creeper like some others I've seen. Surgery was quick and painless . Overall great expierence ! Would def recommend.

<text>Good for an easy and fun night out. Between the arcade games, drinks, bowling, and karaoke rooms, you'll find plenty to do. It's in a fairly outdated mall though, so the bathrooms and some other finishes are less than flashy. Some of the arcade games seem a little old or dirty as well, and they have a strange system for how they charge for bowling and shoe rentals. But worth a visit overall, you'll enjoy yourself!< /text><Date>1621677154870<//Date>< user_id>

Such a great venue! There's lots of space for bowling, shooting pool, playing video games, eating, and drinking. There's also a few private rooms as well. Staff was friendly and place was clean. I look forward to hanging out here again soon!< /text>

Great place for fun and drinks but it's really loud and good can't stand bowling or video games. Still I've been here for several parties and get togethers and it's been fun.</text>

<Text>Today was my first time here and my family and I loved it ! It has everything in one spot. It has pool tables, darts, and an arcade! The food and service is quick and tasty. The manager is such a great guy and the staff was friendly.

Brewcade is cool, I went a few times and had a decent time. A lot of the games just aren't that interesting, it's a bit like stepping back in time but to the 80s, when games weren't quite that well developed. If you love retro gaming you'll have fun.</review>

<Review>I super enjoy the 4 hour parking validation that they give and how you can stack validations. It is also located in an asian mall. It's not the nicest or cleanest looking mall but there are a lot of good places to eat if you don't want to eat at xlanes. However you cannot bring outside food or drinks into xlanes.< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOroiCLKqeKjGXisS3LhrenpnsOE8fZ0CblxP89=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP7jHv2vMI-RUHcRp268kkLwIhbvVpLNxHsyTQQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLQBU_0ipeKr37HzF8ygZJnnrzfiN3LnTUUB4l=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNusogog0SBXi_3nhFpUlsiZIl7S2TychXISHr3=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPXOR7nLapO5N_D_2wfGUmwF-qdLCuP7r3V8bSf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMpdAichrNlw2-D5yEVCbZGiQzWrujRQgCh-2V8=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNbd58JFtTTDBaBigfnHslRdIqKUwjPxUa9eXj-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPpdBNJ9E2y5u0Fw68aGyBpAyzuG_ID31xEdng5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPDcQwSiIHglrqfb7qBzMmR93NSdumBnRAo1h_p=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNBI4dPiIXtbclvM5Q4qixjV-sWElCJfk8LdCmM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< resp>

<rating>4< /rating><Text>Drinks are expensive but it's expected to be with the location of lovely downtown Los Angeles as X-Lane's home. I've enjoyed many weekend nights here having fun with friends at their pool tables. Pitchers of beer are delicious, waitresses/hostesses are friendly and fast to pick up old or discarded items. It's nice to have fun in this atmosphere without an overbearing crush of people. I recommend playing some pool here.< /Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None<//Response><gmap_id>0x80c2c639a6f4292d:0xff6517f71cd550c9</gmap_id></record>

Loved it... Give five stars for service... However bowling prices need to go down

I would spend twice the money and go twice as often if it was more affordable... 50 an hour is too much</review>

<Text>My Birthday celebration with my cousin, friends & coworkers. WE HAD A BLAST!!!!!!! I Don't sing but forced to karaoke. LMAO. Bowling took too long. So we shut down the place with Jump Jump kris Kross & Scooby Snacks. Loved them all. Prior to that the arcade was amazing. Everyone should check it out. VEGGIE pizza was good & Calamari etc. I just enjoyed it all. Fun place.< /Text>< pics>

<review>Good parmesan fries and the lanes were nice.

They force you to pay for raggedy bowling shoes. Seems as if they went and purchased old shoes from some junk yard. I just refuse to believe this happened over time by just bowling and if so they need to realize when to cut their losses.  You pay all this money to bowl and in return they don't have the decency to have presentable shoes.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPYjtftEWgWgTsgDcN1L1TPbBlBYDxkpoXf5qcr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPnuzm-5ZiXcrI3ul1G90MiSAIlqv8fgNZdJHj-=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

<text>We get here. You have to buy a game card for $1 and then you can add amount of money and you slide card to play. My only problem is most of the damn games are OUT OF ORDER!!  Waste of time. They need to service these games or put an out of order sign on the screen.  Welp I dont think we will be back any time soon.<//text>< Pics>

I Definitely enjoyed spending my money on game cards to play in the Arcade with a group of friends, although the best part is the wide variety of out of service games and on top of that, I wasn't able to spend any money at all due to the unavailable out of service games. On top of that this place has a no refund policy, so in other words I got screwed. If you want to have fun with friends and share a couple drinks, go to Dave & Busters the selection is bigger and have the latest, don't get robbed here.<//Text>

We were waiting in the arcade area where half of the machines were out of order, and the VR games are a special extra paid item for some reason. You don't just pay the fee for the game; you have to buy a special wrist band even just to be about to pay for each game. We ended up leaving because we still didn't get a lane after waiting over an hour.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

Be careful of this establishment.   They allowed someone to steal my credit card information and charged close to $500 worth of unauthorized transactions.    Several transacions in one day.   I live in Ohio so I don't know how were able to put it through.<//Review>

Very annoying and restrictive entrance ID policy. The policy is as complicated and irritating as it is random. Lost all my friends and my business FOREVER and no doubt many others.
One of the bouncers was kind and respectful but the others were extremely rude and aggressive.

ID is required at a certain time regardless of age.

Then an hour later ID and 18+ can only get in. But they don't remove any kids under 18. I can not imagine why they would turn away potential customers.

Then another hour later it's ID and 21+ yet they still don't remover anyone so it's not like there's a reason people under 21 aren't allowed.

And on top of all this, it's an arcade bowling alley. I cannot FATHOM what idiot came up with that policy. It is almost as if they want to lose money and business.</text>

Went on a Tuesday at 9pm. The games are better than most barcades however there where many that where shut down and u fortunately the air hockey is still out of order. (Has been for over a month) There is a really bad smell around the bar area. (They should work on that)<//review>

Great place, cool vibe. On the 3rd floor of shopping center, has bar with cool amount of tables and booths, bowling alley, food bar, and arcade. Arcade are is cool but very small, so not worth more than 20 bucks, you use a card to play games.< /review>

Waiters tend to you while you bowl. $50 an hour for up to 6 people. Decent arcade games. Good looking pool tables and dart boards. Beer expensive though, $6 - $8 a pint...< /review>

<text>I didn't bowl. I shot pool and ate pizza. My friends were enjoying themselves bowling though. The entire atmosphere was great and the pizza was deliciously superb! They have NFL Sunday Ticket and open at 10:00am on Sundays. I'll definitely be going back! And if you haven't...You should!</text><rating>5<//rating>< Date>

<review>This bowling alley was ok. I mean it’s kind of hard to leave a 5 star review at a bowling alley because they all kind of suck, but this one didn’t suck as much. The price was average. they don’t have many alleys so there was a wait. I would recommend just because their drinks were strong.< /review>< Rate>

Great customer service. Employees are friendly, patient and very helpful. The price is fair for the food quality. It's a great place to hang out till L.A. traffic cools down. It's the closest thing to a Dave n Busters you're gonna get to unless you want to drive to Hollywood or Arcadia.
Pool, darts, Arcades, sports bar, bowling and more.</text>

It's tough to find a good sports bar in DTLA. In that regard xLanes is a bit of a hidden gem in Little Tokyo, Arts District adjacent. Lots of TVs. 3 big projector TVs are front & center. They play almost everything except boxing & UFC main events. Great place to catch Lakers, Dodgers & NFL games. Game audio is played. Add a food menu, a full bar, a fun bartending staff & it's going to be a good time. ⚾🍻🏈🍻🏀🍻🏒</review>

I am very conflicted about this bowling alley. If you are looking for a nice arcade, they don't really have much of a selection. If you are looking for a bowling alley, there are nicer looking and cheaper alternatives. For what it is though, I must say that this place isn't bad. If you are in Little Tokyo and really found the urge to bowl, then this option isn't bad, but if you are willing to travel further I really think there are better options.< /text>

<review>I like Xlanes LA. Honestly it's a really pumped Friday nights so the way to Sunday nights. The food there is from 0-10, 10 being the best it's an 8 1/2. The nachos are great if you have a lot of people with you. The cheese sticks delicious. If your lactose intolerant then don't even go there. Pretty pricey if I may add.</review>< pics>

<review>Located inside Little Tokyo Galleria Market is x-lanes. A bowling alley, pool hall, full sports bar, latest state of the art arcade center, private karaoke rooms, and banquet rooms all in one place. They have something for everyone.

I've been here a few times for drinks and karaoke.There are plenty of up-to-date songs with fun neon lights, tables, and chairs. Karaoke on the weekend is  $50/an hr. A bit pricey IMO.

The bar area has several big screen TVs and almost always has it on a sports channel. There are plenty of tables and booths. Drink prices are relatively cheap.

I love the bowling area. There are spacious seating and table for each lane. You can even have your own private party at the table. They offer party packages that includes food & bowling. There's very loud music playing in this part of the venue.

All in all, it's a great place to come for some fun & games.< /review>< gmap_id>

<Text>Booked a karaoke room for cinco de mayo. I was not disappointed. Sound system were great and they had a huge selection. They also have bowling alleys, billiards, and arcades. Remember to grab a bite at their bar and restaurant. Perfect hidden gem in Little Tokyo.

Edit: Also, forgot to mention they have parking validations!</Text><rating>5</rating>< Name>

ID is required to get in even if you are not drinking so don't forget it at home.  The bar servers are friendly and fast. If you didn't want to eat at one of the local spots near by they  do have a restaurant, and you can order from the bar as well.   It is very outdated with it's look and kept environment. It was very much of a high school hang out feel, I was waiting for hall monitors to break out any second.  Overall  I would go again to chill and watch a game or bowl with some friends.  One very nice feature is the parking structure next door and they validate parking!  Win win for DTLA.</Text></record>

One of the best place to hand out and play in the surrounding area, when there is no event going on. They have pool tables, bowling, arcade games and pitchers with a great atmosphere. The space is a little small but still a great spot. What more do you need. A really chill spot, where you can take anyone from young to old.< /review>

<Text>This place is great with lots to do! There is bowling , arcade games, billiards, and a restaurant and bar!
The arcade used to be a lot bigger a few years ago so I was a bit disappointed that they took some really fun games away! Be sure to call and ask when they start checking ids. Today (Saturday) at 7pm only 18 and up are allowed and at 9pm only 21 and up!
Have fun!:)< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<text>Been here a couple times, not too shabby. Above average bowling lanes, fun arcades, and good lounge. The music is a tad bit too loud, and the lanes and games are a little bit broken. But not to the point where I wouldn't go again. Had a good time with friends.< /text></record></dataset><record>

Hadn't bowled in years! I forgot how much fun it was to play, especially when you get together with a dozen of your closest friends, bowling 🎳is actually exciting not to mention affordable. XLanes LA gave us a great package deal which included shoe rental that will surely stir the inner bowler in you!<//text>

Great place for kids down town i
I have not bowled here so i don't know about that. If you have kids and need to kill a couple hours this is a good place there is a small restaurant (expensive) and an arcade area which is really fun for the kids. Parking is validated.< /Review>

Great Bowling alley, clean lanes atmosphere is great too. Bit of a wait for a lane but good food and drink selection at the bar, and lots of arcade games while you wait. Only thing I would change is the hourly rate. It's pretty expensive. And with Kids they tend to Bowl slow. I prefer the old days when you paid per game, and didn't feel so rushed to cram in as many games as you can into one hour. Especially at $70 an hour for a weekend night. Think that's a bit greedy. But overall the experience was great. Just way too pricey for bowling, and they wouldn't let the kids parents watch the kids bowl cause only 6 people per lane. Even if your not Bowling you can't just sit and watch your kids Bowl. There policy doesn't make a lot of sense.</Text>

Not the cheapest way to bowl. Fridays, if you're interested in bowling after 4pm, they charge an hourly rate and by total party size (not just per bowler).

It is a good spot, central, in a plaza with good food options, but so pricey on weekends.<//review>

<text>Came here on a company holiday party, so can't quite answer to the prices as our company paid for the catering, ball room, complimentary bowl lanes and arcade card. Nonetheless had an awesome experience, despite how packed the bar is at times, there was never a long wait to get the bar tender to serve your drinks, always on point. It appears alot of private parties and company parties are held here so the entire place is full of excitement and mingling (all ages) and dont be surprised if you run in to people you know here, happened few times on first outing.< /text>< pics>

Holy moly! 3.5 hour wait for bowling on a sunday afternoon (approx 5pm)! But there are areas nearby you can kill time if you're willing to wait.  They will text you when your lane is ready,  with a 5 minute window to redeem the text. Lanes are nice though :)</review>

I hate bowling...
So bypass the endless aisles of lanes.

But I like drinking!
So please stop at the full service bar. Yes they have beers, wines, and spirits and reasonably priced. No it's not happy hour but its what's to be expected at a gaming lounge.

I hate dirty bathrooms.
So please don't use these bathrooms. They were filthy. The smell of vomit and feces quickly filled my nose upon entering. And the conditions of the stalls matched the order.

But I do like karaoke!
They have two options. 1. Rent a room per hour to sing your heart out (gets kinda of pricey. 2. Pay $5 to record yourself in a super cool booth to your favorite hits. I choose the later. Least you get to walk home with a CD you can possibly sell in a Superior parking lot. But either option leads to a super fun time.

Overall this is an awesome place for fun. In addition to what's mentioned above, they do have billiards, food (pretty tasty pizza!!) and validated parking. What more could you ask for!</review>

This place in general looks new. Not run down or aging as other places.
The arcade was mediocre. They need to bring in more exciting and brand new games that people would actually get hooked to or bring classic arcade games.
The bowling lanes are well kept.
They have several karaoke rooms which are about $30/HR on a weekday. The sound system is okay. The songs are updated.
They have a dart game system that you pay the machine cash to. The billiard hall tables are also well kept.
They have a liquor bar.

It's located at the top floor of the building so it's a good place to go after having a buffet party next door at Manna.<//review>

Very pricey. Recommend to make reservations a day or few hours before for bowling. Gets crowed. Lots of fun. Any arcades, pool, and a bar. Overall, a place I'll go again with friends and family.<//text>

Staff are disrespectful! I don’t recommend this place if you want to drink and play. We stayed until 2am and we were trying to finish our drink cos we know we can’t bring it outside. A guy came to us and rudely took the drinks from our hand and put it on the cart. Like really? They could’ve let us finish it atleast. It’s expensive $16<//Review>

<text>We came in to play the arcade games and pool. Most of the games were broken  and didn't calculate points correctly at all. There were so many pool tables with half of them not even being used, but there was around a 30 minute wait to play because we had to reserve one. I can't vouch for the bowling, but don't recommend the arcade. It was a waste of money.</text>< pictures>

<text>XLanes is a great date destination (LOL).

They have plenty of games, a bowling alley and if you're into billiards, a nice pool hall to whoop some ass.

Very reasonably prices and located inside a shopping center. I believe this is on the 3rd floor. Very fun and great place to enjoy with a date or with friends.

Parking is metered street parking or can go underground.<//text>< pictures>

Awesome place to drink and I have honestly never actually bowled here. I've gone here to karaoke, play pool, darts, and arcade games, but have never bothered to bowl here because it's kind of expensive. But if you're looking to just have a good time and drink this is an awesome spot.< /Review>

The arcade is tiny, and has a funky card system that prevents you playing two games in a row on the same machine. The rhythm touch game automatically selected songs all three times I tried it, and the Pump It Up machines guard bars were dangerously loose. The food for the event I went to was really good, but past that, I'm really not impressed. It's no D&Bs, and definitely isn't a Round One.< /Review>

I'm unsure why this place has such great reviews. The employees were rude, half the games didn't work, and we were skipped for our bowling lane 20 mim after being put on the list when I was told it would be an hour and a half wait. Over rated and over priced.<//text>

I want to like this place. The location is great and it's surrounded by great places to eat.

Unfortunately, my experience wasn't the best.

First, it's really expensive for bowling. Comparable to Lucky Strike, but not as nice.

Second, my lane didn't work properly and it took many resets before being given another lane.

Third, the arcade scene is a little weak and expensive.

Bottom line is the experience doesn’t live up to the amount of money you put out. Pity.</Review>

This place was noisy but had a good vibe and the bowling lanes were okay, and so were the shoes they gave me. I also liked the pizza alot; I didn't expect it in such a place. I didn't try the arcade machines but they had a variety of them, in addition to several pool tables.<//Text>

<Text>For all Pro Bowlers. If you like to bowl here... don't. They obviously don't oil the lanes daily or ever. Sad for the nice alley. But the lanes have no oil on it at all.< /Text>< Rate>

<Rating>2< /Rating><Text>The Venus is great. There’s a lot of great things to play, TVs to watch anything, karaoke and of course bowling. The food is decent too. Not the best, but you won’t be complaining about that. What hurts Xlanes and makes me give them two stars is the service. The waitress at the bar, the staff in the bowling alley and the employees walking around all had one thing in common. They hated their job. They made me feel so unwelcome. And for a place as empty as this you would imagine it would be the opposite. Unfortunately I won’t be back. There are just too many equally cool places that won’t make me feel better unwanted.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

It was just amazing. Had a great time bowling and playing at the arcade, but the only complain I have is the claw machine. It is probably the most rigged claw machine I have ever seen it's grab is strong, but once it goes up it literally opens. If it weren't for that little  thing my rating would have been a 5.</text>

<text>If you're going to bowl it can be very busy some nights. I had a 2 hr wait time but it was worth it because they upgraded us to the VIP lanes because all thw othera were reserved. I took my daughter for her birthday party here. The downside was trying to order food without service in sight to get menus. But once we were able to be taken of they really did a good job. My server was Asian and I forget his name of hand but he was great and treated us very well after all said and done.</text>< time>

Diversified fun for the whole: individual, couple, circle of friends, family, etc.  XLanes has something for everybody featuring 9 pool tables; full-bar; arcade; and of course bowling lanes.

Located on the 3rd floor of the Little Tokyo Plaza off Alameda, XLanes is a welcoming business to this otherwise empty plaza.

Prices are a bit on the steep side.  An hour of pool is $15, add a couple of beers (cheap) at $5 each and your one our of fun will end up costing you about $25.  That is a pretty expensive hour of fun.

I think other people were wiser than I to this as the bar was packed.  I think people decided to put all of their entertainment money on their bar tap than on pool or bowling.</review>

<Review>I would visit this place again since I live so close to it. They have an arcade, an area with pool tables, a bowling alley, a restaurant, and a bar. I have not bowled so I don't know the pricing. The price to play pool is $15 dollars an hour. The bar has a nice selection of beers but they are a little pricey. I don't want to pay $6-7 for a but light. I ordered a pizza at the bar and it was not bad. One thing I find annoying is that security pats you down as you walk in. There is a large security presence, which makes it seem lowbrow. They also have a rule against wearing hats.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<Review>Multiple issues with staff on saturday night. Firstly my reservation was for 8 but i was stuck on the freeway since 7:30 and called multiple times no answer. I honestly tried to reach then but they never answer there phone. Even during the week on a tuesday when i tried to make the reservation no one answered so I arranged to come to their location on alemeda around my work schedule showed up the place is empty. I paid to reserve two lanes for 2 hours.( Ended up getting a third lane for extra party members). Because i was stuck on the freeway my guest were not able to check in I arrived at 8:20 in the parking lot and walked in at 8:25. I called multiple times to tell them I would be late but no one answered the phone like always. The young lady working called me once as I was parking didnt answer. When i called back as I am walking in she tells me they cancelled my reservation because I didnt answer their one call. This was the first issue! When I come in I showed the young lady I was on the phone with the multiple calls on my phone where I tried to reach out and they did not answer. Initially she cancelled my reservation but was able to get us on lane 13 and 14. I understand that the young lady was overwhelmed when my party was getting shoes because everytime we asked for a size she said the run big and they needed to change them, but she was easily frustrated on a saturday night like she gave no F%!ks. Secondly the lanes were malfunctioning constantly either giving people strikes or not enough pins coming down in the frame. So they took 30 minutes to reset the lanes and extended our time. Mind you my party spent well over a 1,000 dollars not including what I spent on the lanes and shoes. We had a mixed group of African American and Hispanic Americans. Once done for her Birthday my girl asked a staff member to take a picture she was salty but took the picture. We were astonished first time asking that particular staff member for anything and she was salty for what reason. Lastly they are quick to take food and pitchures back. While in Karoke a staff member can in for a pitcher the wasnt empty and said are you gonna finish it so I can take it. Is it a rush your open until 2:00 am! Just bad service, but the manager was nice his staff was out of pocket from the time we came in until we left. Wait im still here woops!</Review><Time>1554019456964</Time>< Pictures>

Fun but seemed like the game didnt last long after inputting all the names. Karaoke was really fun! Two microphones is not though when you have children who dont want to share...lol! Wish the arcade was a little bigger, easy to go through all the games rather quickly. Overall, I had fun, would go back but its pretty far from my house, so no time soon. 🙂<//text>

Very nice place to go hang out, some of the machines did not work on the arcade portion of the building, however both the pool table and bowling alley are in good condition.

A fair bit on the pricey side for the bowling and pool tables, but still worth it however.</review>

<text>They took out the arcade area because they are remodeling! So you can really just go there to grab a drink,  eat, and bowl.

It's nice that they have rooms for a more private experience.</text>< pictures>

We came here expecting to find a fun arcade and bowling experience, and found a sparse selection of arcade game options, and those available were in poor condition.  The air hockey table didn't even work!  And bowling?  Well, forget that.  Ridiculously overpriced!  Like I'm going to spend close to $50 just for one session of bowling!  That's insane, even for LA!  Already found much better arcades at Family Amusement Corporation, definitely won't be coming back to this place.<//text>< pictures>

<Review>Most of the employees here are not very friendly. I think this place is good only for bowling. I don't think the food is that great and kinda over priced.</Review>< date>

Typical boweling alley but we still had lots of fun; did not like that you have to pay to park and they do not validate.  Parking outside on the street is all meter parking.<//review>

<Review>It's a nice place but I was disappointed with their bowling policy. We started at the arcade... spent $63 ($20 a card... $1 fee per card).... We then decided to bowl! We were 3 adults 2 kids and two 2 year olds. 2 kids and 1 adult were going to bowl. (2 adults had to be with each of their little one). They said we all had to get shoes, we were bothered but it's understandable, whatever no biggie. Then they said only 6 of us could be in there because it's 6 per lane... the lady was dumb sarcastic. I can't believe we're 7 & they didn't let us in ... they counted the toddlers!?! Like really!? It's  $50 a lane & you want us to pay $50 because we're over 1 person WHO ISN'T EVEN GOING TO BOWL!?!? We left, went to AMF Bowling instead ✌✌✌ I wish we would have checked first & not spent a dime on that place. Left 2 stars because we did have a nice time at the arcade... it would have been a beautiful night but they killed it... 👎< /Review>< userid>

I've had two experiences at XLanes, one being a four star, the other a one, so two stars is well deserved. A few months ago, I went there with a few coworkers during the week to have a few drinks and blew off some steam. A few beers later and a couple games of bowling, it was a great night. Good atmosphere and decent service.

Now a couple weeks ago, I again revisited XLanes, this time on a Saturday afternoon for some family fun time. The lane we were given was next to a kid's bday party, which was unnecessary with a dozen other lanes open. The adults at the party, we cannot call them parents since they were doing no parenting, proceeded to sit and chat while they're children through multiple bowling balls down their lanes, jamming the machine, and spilled into our lane, ruining one of my daughter's frames. I called for a worker and someone went and fixed their lane, but never did anyone from XLanes apologize nor do anything to correct this idiocy.

Unfortunately, it seems that XLanes has lost a customer.<//Review>

<review>Went there with my cousins the other day to play some Pool. The security didn’t let us in saying we where to young, so we showed him our ID’s we are all 18+ years old. The guy told us no we where too young and didn’t want us drinking. We told him we don’t drink we just want to play pool for a hour. He then said “get out before I get my manager and I call the other staff members who work here to escort you out of the building”< /review><date>1534471328643<//date><user_id>110247987071792999187<//user_id>< GmapID>

<time>1487258129572< /time><review>Upon arrival it's quite attractive. It was clean, open spaced and set up nicely. There were plenty of games and i loved the lanes. BUT that customer service was horrible! We were there for 45 mins and not one person came to our lane to take our drink/food order. I went to counter and was told that they would send someone. Nope. We then moved to the restaurant area and after 10 mins there, still no acknowledgement! I spoke with manager and he stated he was not short staffed so there was no reason we shouldn't have been served. He stated he would speak with servers. I doubt it, because most managers would remedy the situation at that moment. That wasn't our case. Just a bad experience. I wanted to love this place so badly too. smmfh.</review>< Pics>

<Text>Honestly, I was so excited to play games when I got here, I even walked around to see what games and how to play the games but then I was so urgent to pay cash to play video with my lovely girlfriend, I even asked the people that work there for the pricing and they gave me the pricing! BUT THEY DID NOT LET ME KNOW I NEEDED TO LEAVE A DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD TO BE ABLE TO PLAY. That literally ruined my day because I was happy that I was finally going to play games again and they didn't inform you right in order to come and have fun at the X LANES. SO I don't recommend y'all coming here because they are going to let you down for not knowing how to inform you right, just go to Boomerz because that spot hella more lit and friendly there. And yes you DONT NEED A DEBIT OR CREDIT CARD AT BOOMERZ.</Text>< user_id>

I came to bowl. However it was a 3hour waiting list. And some lanes weren't even open!
I played pool instead for  15$/hour, You can't beat that price. Over all it was a great Atmosphere!

Note: parking in this complex is horrible!!! The spaces are compact and some ppl Hogg up 2 spaces, we had to drive to the top of the rap 5 floors just to find parking!

It's really packed during the weekends!</Text>

Great place for parties and hanging out with friends. Prices are a little high though. They have everything you could want: bar, billiards, bowling, arcade and karaoke.< /Text>

Meh, food was mediocre and drinks were not properly made. Service was disoriented and waiting staff seemed equally confused as me as to where to find things and who to go to. Games were fun though and the bowling is cool< /Review>

< Review>
The confusing part about this place is that it is located inside a shopping mall. There usually aren't many signs showing where X lanes is, but its on the top floor of the shopping center. When you come inside its probably the place is clean and new and they have glow in the dark bowling with tv screens with espn playing. The food service was OK and the bowling can get a bit pricey for regular bowling.</Review>

Seems like a lot of the bowling alleys are hard to come by around downtown Los Angeles.  This place is located in the Mitsuwa plaza, formerly known as Yohan in J-Town if you guys didn't know that.  This place reminds me of another bowling alley venue in Puente Hills called Round 1 with the combination of bowling, snookers and karaoke.  They also have a nice bar on the side for people who enjoy a couple of nightcaps or two.  The only thing are the prices for bowling it's pretty expensive so be prepared to spend lots of money.  Make sure to go with a bigger crowd to get some type of discount.<//text>

The bowling lanes are huge which is good. Lots of pool tables and quite a few arcades. The arcade department maybe could use an upgrade.
Bonito lugar para pasar con los amigos o familia.< /text>

GREAT!!! Billiards, arcade, bowling, private karaoke rooms, great bar and restaurant.  Think of combining Lucky Strike and Dave & Busters...throw in some pizzazz and sophistication and you've got Xlanes...great place for an afternoon for some food, dirnks and fun ,a Saturday night date...out with a couple of friends or a gathering of 20 or more for group rates and party packages...check it out and ENJOY!!!</review>

<text>We bowled, the kids played video games & then we ended with noraebang. An expensive night, but it was a blast. My husband hung out at the bar while the kids played video game. The song book has a ton of Korean songs (only in Korean koreaboos!).

Down side was some decrepit old white lady  really thought she could just come into our room & hang ou, while her husband creeped outside our room . Had to tell her to skat. So they need better security by the noreabang so riff-raff can't ruin people's evenings.</text></record></dataset><record>

Not the best place to bowl. Score kept glitching and would record random scores. Lanes had no preparation. No proper wax pattern. Pins would keep falling too and resetting them wasted so much of our time</review>

Worst expirence ever we got there at 9pm for bowling and the lady tolds us to wait between 2 to 3 hours. So, we did and decided to wait we were constantly asking about if it was our turned and they kept telling us no it will be your turn for another 45 minutes. So we kept waiting until we decide to go and asked them again if it was our turned by 1 am and they said we called you which it was a lie they never call us or anything. Then we decide to talked to their managers whicg they made it worst they don't even know how to treat customers or anything we show our phone to then they said try to call us many times which we never recived any call. Which it sucks because we wait 4 hours for nothing worst place ever to play bowling not recommend at all.< /Text>

It is pretty much a Round 1 mixed with Dnb, because they allowed wide range of drinks as opposed to only beer and wine.  I wasn't quite sure why security was stricter than an 18 year old night club but we were frisk and i even had to opened my altoids mint box!?

Once i enter the premised i understood why the strict regulations of no hats allowed and such throrugh body pat down, the crowd is full of tennie boppers and drunk tards!

Location is quite large with 2 bar area, pool area, and bowling lane, also an area similar to DnB with games and such- if they crowd wasn't as crazy as it was i think we would be more prone to visiting. But we did get kicked out because a friend in the group got super wasted, but I'm pretty sure it was because the table next to us started problem with us and we were given the boot.<//Text>

<Review>Don't get me wrong I had a wonderful time doing karaoke but they're weekday service is horrible cuz there's not enough waitress or surround and you can't hear the bartender on top of that I paid $30 for a drink by mistake because the music was so loud that I could not hear what the bartender was telling me I do recommend it it's like a Dave & Buster's in a way but just be careful when you're speaking to the waitress and Waiters and bartenders< /Review><response>None<//response>< Pictures>
