I’ve taken my pup 3 x now and have had a great experience with the office. They seem very caring and loving towards the pets. After every visit I always receive a follow up call from the office to check on by pup... how awesome is that not even my Dr does that. Great place highly recommend them.</review><gmapID>0x80c334bc6489cfdf:0x6ea96e87468ff986< /gmapID>< UserId.>

I absolutely love this Animal Hospital the girls there are very nice and they real care about your pets. I travel from Covina to Ontario its worth it also they are the cheap I looked around everywhere! This is our baby! He got his 12 week shots. They even did a follow up call to see how he was doing. Love Inland Animal Hospital thank you!!<//text>

Who can understand that, when yours is only one lb?  You panic!

Great staff. Doctors and techs alike are wonderful people. They offer quality and affordable care. I'm a former vet tech, so I'm extremely picky about my pets' medical team, and these guys are excellent. I take all of my pets (two dogs and four cats) to see them! They also helped me save Loki, a former feral kitten who was on death's door. She's doing fantastic now and is a beautiful little love.</Text>

<Text>I called because I was concerned my dog was not acting herself and Alexa picked up the phone and was SO helpful, gave me suggestions on how to help my dog act more herself. She made a point that they were always available but didn’t give me the usual (we won’t know til you bring them in) she heard my story out and gave me a great opinion on what would be best for my dog (behavioral issues) I will be taking my pets here from now on.<//Text>< Time>

<review>I took my precious cat to get euthanized yesterday to end his suffering and Dr Kim was very caring and gentle and explained the steps he would take and what would happen. I was so pleased when he actually gave him a shot to put him to sleep first before he gave him the lethal injection. Most vets that I called wouldn't do that so I was very grateful that my Ziggy didn't get the lethal injection first. It was one of the hardest days of my life and I'm glad that Dr Kim made it is easy as possible. I have one kitty left and that's where I'll be taking him from now on.</review>< Pictures>

I took my Momma cat here for a wound she came home with on her back, rather than the normal vet my family used and I couldn’t be happier. Everyone is very knowledgeable and efficient. The waiting room is not very welcoming but the warmth of the vet and staff more than make up for it. I’m glad to report Momma is doing very well and healing wonderfully. I am confident I have the perfect doctor for my fur babies.< /Review>

I use to come here 15+ years ago when the father was the vet.  They took great care of my dog.  Now I've moved back to the area and just got a new puppy.  The people at the front desk were super nice and Dr Kim, the son is a really nice man.  Made sure I understood everything, took the time to answer my questions and I felt the prices were very reasonable.  My pup seemed very comfortable.< /text>

<Review>5 years ago Dr Kim save my German Sheppard when he had parvo. I continue to see Dr Kim for all our shots and check ups. The staff has changed over the years and the new staff is great. I won't go anywhere else. The care he provides is second to none and his rates are very affordable. Other vets will bleed you dry.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80c334bc6489cfdf:0x6ea96e87468ff986< /Gmap_id>< user_id>

Another vet wanted to charge me so much that I didn't think I would be able to afford a procedure my dog needed. I got a second opinion from them and they saved my boy's life. The ladies at the front desk were so sweet too. I strongly recommend them to very one now.< /Review>< Pictures>

A good place to take your pet to have them checked up on, but know more fees will apply than the visit fee so make sure you ask up front.  I took my pet in to get some more pain pills for her arthritis in her hips.  Her pills had ran out and I called in to get the prescription refilled.  They said I would only have to pay the visit fee.  Once I got in and seen the vet, they tell me they have to take blood work, etc. to refill her pain meds.  This is when I find out it will cost me over $200 for the blood work and they cant refill her meds without it.  Suffice to say I just paid the visit fee for absolutely nothing.  Left with no pain meds for my dog and upset I was not told up front what would be necessary to have her prescription refilled.  I would have came when I had $200+ to get more pain meds.  No transparency!< /text>

The doctor is very thorough with the owners of the pet, also does not walk away without asking if you totally understand or have any other questions. The work they performed on our dog was excellent. The girls in the front or also thorough with their work. The pricing at this facility is fair and is not way out of bounds.<//Text>

Thank You for your understanding and compassion, we took our sweet Mindy to you ..but it was to late her heart stopped ..we said goodbye  to her and you consoled us telling us she had a good life and was Loved by us till the end.  We were total strangers to you but we had one thing in common, our loving pets are FAMILY and are morned just like family..Thank you for the Card you also sent. Now three months later Mindys sister Mickey is also dying I hold her and she whispers to me she wants to go with Mindy. I'm sad but when she passes I will think of all the words of comfort you and your receptionist said.  Thank You</review>

I cannot express how grateful I am to Dr Kim and his staff. They are the greatest, kindest, veterinary office I've ever dealt with. From cats with urinary tract blockages,  to our dog with pancreatitis, or our other dog diagnosed with skin cancer, we've gone through so many pet emergencies, surgeries, etc. They have been the greatest; always kind, always helpful. They are the greatest.  I'm not going anywhere else. I cannot praise them enough! Very reasonable prices. I'm not one to post reviews online, but I am seriously so grateful for Dr Kim and his staff!<//review>

Dr. Kim and staff are awesome! I brought my dog in on Monday, because his left eye looked infected, and he was lethargic and not eating or drinking.  It turns out his teeth were badly infected, and the infection spread up into the eye. After 12 pulled teeth, a dose of pain medicine, and a good night of rest, he was back his old self!  I took my dog to the vet hospital on Sunday, and they didn't do much but charge me a small fortune.  I'm so thankful for Inland Animal Hospital!<//Text>

<Review>They took great care of our cat when we suspected she had developed pyometra and she ended up needing an emergency ovariohysterectomy. They saw her that morning and we were able to take her home that evening.
One of the technicians even gave us her cell phone number and told us we could call anytime day or night if we had any concerns.
They're also reasonably priced and friendly.
I would highly recommend Inland Animal Hospital. In fact, I've already referred relatives there.< /Review>< user_name>

Fanatic selections for breakfast or lunch! Grabbed a deli style sandwich to go and it was great. Friendly staff and exceptionally quick service. A gem off the beaten path .< /Review>

I absolutely love this place. The bread is fresh and always delicious. I always buy this bread with cream cheese with bits of jalapenos inside. I will definitely come back here some more.< /text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Best Mexican bread for over 40 years. They used a  granular sugar on their conchas then the powdered sugar like most places. Gives a little crunch when eating. Best to eat the when fresh. Only thing neighborhood is very rough stay on main streets. Don't go into the sides streets.< /review></record>

My dad HAS to stop here before going back to La Mirada & he mentions that sometimes they have big empanadas de calabaza & sometimes they don't idk what's up with that...I've had the conchas & those were good but one time he brought "bolillo" home I put it in parenthesis because it was more like a sub roll it wasn't floury on the outside or have the crispy outside like legit bolillo like the bakery on 1st Street by the post office or the bakery on Floral & Mednik very disappointing<//Review>

The pan dulce (sweet bread) is great, but their tamales are not good; hence the 4 stars, not 5. I will not buy tamales from there again, they had vegetables in them.< /Text>

For one there are no prices labeled so you have no way of knowing how much your spending If you have a certain amount of money you would have to keep asking how much each item is so you don't go over your limit.  I ended up paying $2 for items I  normally pay 50c or 75c for.  I wasn't given a receipt either so I  couldn't check it. I  was given a ride to the bakery so I didn't have time to question anything it wasn't until I  got home that I realized I either got taken advantage of or this place is overpriced.  I also remembered of all the business there that bakery was the only one with graffiti. Probably someone not appreciating being taken advantage off. I  won't be returning
I understand now why there is a line at El Gallo bakery just down the street and La Fama was empty.< /Review>

<text>Traditional Mexican bakery, in the heart of ELA. The sweet bread also known as pan dulce, it's baked daily. From $2.00 tamales, hot coffee, bollilos and other goodies. Great customer service, Janet was very nice and helpful!< /text>< Pictures>

Favorite bakery ever! I don't live in the area I commute from my neighborhood to enjoy the breads and desserts at La Fama. They are always clean and well kept and the bread is usually fresh and is very delicious. I come here at least once a month.< /review>

<rate>4< /rate><review>Was planning on picking up some pan dulce from El Gallo this morning for work, but being Christmas Eve, there was a line down the block, so after a quick Google Search, found La Fama just around the block. I appreciated the self service style of La Fama, the slow service at El Gallo always drives me nuts. Grabbed a tray, some tongs, and filled up with pan. The lady who rang us up was very friendly and we were out quickly. Quality was also very good. La Fama saved the day for me. 👍</review>< pics>

<date>1541822256428<//date><text>I've been coming to this yummy bakery since I was a kid not too far from El Gallo Bakery that was also once a great place for pan dulce.  However in the last couple of years El Gallo Bakery bread quality and taste of their pan dulce is just way too greasy.  That's why I always keep coming back to La Fama Bakery.  Their sweet bread and bolillos always fresh and warm! When you visit you must try their champurado!! It's so delicious nice and hot   usually around 5pm they make a fresh batch. 😊<//text><username>Claudia Cruz</username>< Response>

<Review>Stella was the best! I had a unit here for over 10 years. I moved out of state, forgetting my unit entirely. When it came time to move out, I wasn’t able to get everything out of my unit in time. So Stella took it upon herself to make sure the unit met all requirements for move out just so I wouldn’t be charged. She went above and beyond. She made a difficult situation easy. Now, the next time I need a storage unit, I’m heading to the nearest Public Storage, hoping to find another property manager like Stella. Thank you!</Review><rate>5</rate><pics>None<//pics><Name>Aaron Brown<//Name>< gmap_id>

<Review>We LOVE Public Storage! We use them for various reasons but this time we needed to store our car for a couple of months in a safe, clean place & Public Storage always meet our needs! Everything is fast, easy, organized & a great price too! The girl that checked me in was so clear & thorough with all the details (I forgot her name) & checking out with Eric took just minutes! I can't wear a mask so he was so kind to come outside to bring me my move-out receipt! Fast, easy, friendly & professional! They both did a great job & we appreciate it! Thank you so much Public Storage!!!</Review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80dd20769b7d9bef:0xebb03227807e103f<//Gmap_id></record>

Etella the property manager was fantastic. I was out of town  and she was able to help with questions and issues I had regarding my storage unit. She made everything easy and was always accessible when I called. I also dealt with Lorraine who helped me coordinate a lock replacement and she couldn’t have been nicer or more helpful. Both of them are great representatives of why you would want to use Public Storage for your storage needs.</Review>

I needed a storage space yesterday , went online talked to an actual human being who hooked me up with exactly what I needed fast efficiently ! The unit I needed was $ 160 / month , no problem but they gave me first month for $1, cant beat that , instant move in! Today upon arrival i had a problem the unit I rented was too small , went to office talked to Andy he instantly showed me what was available as an upgrade , I chose a unit after he personally showed me each unit! Instantly pro rated the new rate and I was in the bigger unit with in 5 minutes !!!!!!! Talk about AMAZING customer service this place Rocks !

This particular Public Storage and it's manager Estella, were terrific.  I was there 4 months. Estella always had a smile on her face and a friendly hello.  She seems very motivated, is always walking the property, sometimes with a mop and bucket, always cheerful and offering assistance.
I would highly recommend storing here VS the one at 2065 Placentia - where my reservation/unit was cancelled and given away to a prior walkin despite my arriving at the committed day/time to unload my belongings.  That manager was rude and unhelpful, as was the District Manager Lorraine, who seemed helpful and asked me to submit to her documentation of what had occurred at 2065 Placentia - but never followed up with me! A total lack of respect for me and the time I spent providing her detailed documentation/emails.
Only one negative about this facility.  The crickets were huge and MANY in my 10x12 unit. That was a turnoff - and now that my things are out, I hope I don't find those crickets in my belongings.
Back to Estella - who helped to change my opinion of PS.  I would def recommend 1725 Pomona - thanks to Estella's positive way/service.<//Text>

When leasing a storage unit you have just a minimum idea of what you want and the cost of one unit that you need. My experience was a amazing at this location, by far the best storage facility I’ve been to . Maria was very knowledgeable and not pushy. She proved that customer service that is key and that is needed in every business. She guided me to a storage unit that met my needs and without  no hesitation. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone that needs extra space.</Review>

Emanuel provided amazing service! He asked me what I was looking for and showed me a few available units. He was very polite and the property was very clean. I fully trust Public Storage with my valuables and Emanuel gave me peace of mind that I was in the right hands working with Public Storage. I highly recommend this place if you ate looking for storage in the Costa Mesa area.</Text>

Thank You... even though I WAS sweating haha ...I felt like I didn't even have to break a sweat signing up and every thing.  We love our unit ..♡</review>< pics>

My roommate and I came to this location the other day as we need to find a place to store some of the extra stuff we have now that we have moved in together. This location was very convenient to our apartment and was also very clean and well maintained. We were greeted by Barbara who was super nice and knew exactly what we needed to be able to store some of the books and furniture we had. She had great customer service and bought some boxes to pack the stuff up in. She was right, it was exactly the right amount of boxes that we needed. Barbara knows her stuff and we're definitely coming back here.</text>

NEW MANAGER HAS NO CLUE !!!  Stella is completely clueless and has no idea how to manage.   she made a mistake locking up my storage unit when i WASNT delinquent.   this didn't allow me to move out and now since she won't admit to her mistake public storage wants me to pay all these fees that shouldn't be there because i would have been all moved out if it wasn't for STELLAS error.

there's plenty of other storage units< /Text>

I've utilized Public Storage in several different locations and have always had an overall good experience.  I recently moved to and I'm currently storing my valuables at the Public Storage in Costa Mesa and I'm MORE than satisfied.  Barbara has been friendly and helpful throughout my whole transition and is right in too of any questions or concerns I might have.  She has been very attentive to my needs and has made this storing experience an exceptional one.  I highly recommend entrusting your storables with Public Storage.  Thanks Barbara!<//text>

I had a car parked here for a few months, and when I came back, the battery had died, but Barbara and her associate saved the day by locating a set of jumper cables so I could start my car!

If you need storage or long-term parking with a convenient location near the heart of Costa Mesa just off the 55, let Barbara and the rest of her friendly and helpful staff help you out!</text><username>Logan Harriger</username><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Just rented a unit here and feel very happy with our choice... the unit is clean and the premises seem very secure. Location is super convenient. And Joseph is the man! He is a very nice guy, friendly and helpful, and made our sign-up smooth. Happy to be in his care.</text>

<Review>We've been with this public storage now for 5 years and I must say they're very good. Barber the front office person always has an answer for me and always seems to have a way to solve a problem. A very kind and respectful person. She makes a whole world of difference,  pretty sure that's the reason why we're still here.</Review>< pics>

<review>I had a wonderful experience at this property. The property manager Barbara greeted me with a smile and showed me the perfect size unit that I would be needing. She went over the process step by step and walked me through all of the paperwork. Also suggested some important things I should have like boxes so I can keep all of my things organized, a lock, and some packing peanuts.I'm so thankful for her making my experience a good one.</review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x80dd20769b7d9bef:0xebb03227807e103f</gmap_id></record>

STAY AWAY -- there's plenty of other places.   the management is horrible.   stella has no idea what she's doing.   they will hike prices on u after u move in, try to tack insurance on ur account and after one day delinq they will start a lien sale paperwork .    don't bother<//review>

<Text>Barbara made the whole process a breeze. She listened to my needs and we found a storage unit size that worked for me. She was very informative - not to mention,  the most genuinely kind and pleasant person I have come across in a long while! If if weren't for her, the experience of getting a storage facility would be a dull hassle.

Joseph is the manager at the Public Storage location on Pomona Avenue and you couldn't ask for a harder working or more efficient manager. He does it all! The facility is very clean and easy to locate. I highly recommend this location and my advice to Public Storage - don't lose Joseph. He's a gem!</Text>

<Review>Barbara and Todd were very helpful today. I needed to get into my storage immediately but had broken my only key to my storage lock and could not get in.  Went and talked with Barbara at the front and she told me what I needed to do. She said the only way I could get in is if I had the lock cut off by the manager Todd. She called Todd and he came out the same day to cut it.  I'm extremely happy with my experience and with how quickly they helped me solve the problem. I definitely will be continuing to rent from them and referring them to everyone I know.</Review>< pics>

Barbara who manages this site, is now a friend since providing excellent communication, medical care post a serious car accident prior to a Hoag ER VISIT, had to pay my bill. She was so worried an insisted ER was more important. She has maintained decorum 100% of the time with all clients which is truly exceptional and unlike any other public storage who are all good. I find her flawless. Other units have had overspray, or some sort of theft, troubles, and she runs a smooth ship. I wish upper management would feature her for woman of Orange County. I arrive post electrical fire, where neither Irvine nor Edison took responsibility. Like any big corporation, medical, or other, she is what makes Orange County the reason we grew up here and love it. She is always  looking after others. In addition I was concerned one day about an issue. She took charge and was very calm, in a situation where two other men could not figure out how to get the moving done. I think she attracts quality tenants this way. I would give her 20 stars ******************** : ) Christine Anne, To Corporate, She should be a trainer with her people skill to all of you she is a Gem.........< /text>

I recently visited a couple PS locations in the Newport/Costa Mesa area and this location was by far my favorite! The property was clean and off the beaten path, which made it really easy to get in and out of. The manager was so helpful and very easy to talk to. I will be coming back!</review>

Joseph is the manager at the Public Storage location on Pomona Avenue and you couldn't ask for a harder working or more efficient manager. He does it all! The facility is very clean and easy to locate. I highly recommend this location and my advice to Public Storage - don't lose Joseph. He's a gem!< /Text>

Barbara is a great and powerful warrior and was also helpful funny and all around a fantastic person. If i was older or she was younger we would be a match made in heaven. Maybe she has that Benjamin Button disorder and my dreams could come true. That seems unlikely however because my name also happens to be Benjamin and that is just too much a of a coincidence. Any way the place is nice and you should totally keep all of the things you are going to forget about here. P.S. if you go in and tell Barbara you are native american you are eligible for discounted rate.<//text>

<Text>I rented a unit from this PS. I have never needed storage before so I read several reviews on several different storage facilities and the best money and best reviews was for this PS. I worked with Barbara who was so friendly and a joy to work with. She showed me the unit which was clean and walked me through all the procedures (opening the gate, locking my unit). She rocked and sign up, while there was a several things to sign, was a breeze. Thank you PS and Barbara!</Text>< pics>

<review>I was downsizing and went to public storage to put some things away. The staff there were incredibly helpful and met my needs exactly. Laura helped me specifically, and not only was she incredibly accomdating and knowledgeable but also friendly and unbelievely sweet and professional. Public storage is affordable and very clean. I would recommend this PS to anyone.< /review>< GmapID>

< Review>
A friend was in a bad situation & asked for help with a storage unit rental. Went online & used their express check-in and the property manager, Barbara, called me within 10 minutes, introducing herself, advising me of office times, informed me of supplies available etc... We showed up as she was completing her last transaction, I was ready to sign & "just wanted get it over with" but she wanted me to see the unit first to make sure it was what I needed. When she opened the conveniently located unit it was clean, plenty big enough & had a solid metal floor to keep contents from getting wet when it rained. The unit was perfect, we completed paperwork in a very timely manner & she made the code very easy to remember even for my little pea brain! Transaction was fast, easy & Barbara was awesome! I would definitely use this place again & have no problem recommending this location to anyone!< /Review>

Quick and easy and Barbara, who helped me was just awesome!!   We had quite a bit in common after chatting with her.    She made a great suggestion about a plastic cover for the flooring with the upcoming possibility of a wet, rainy El Niño season upcoming.  Thanks for that Barbara!< /Review>

I rented a unit here on 12/18/2013 and had efficient, helpful and friendly service. Barbara Donohoe answered all of my questions and took care of what I needed immediately. I hadn't called for any information prior to walking in, and still I was in and out in 30 minutes with exactly what I needed at a lower cost than I was expecting. The unit and facility itself are great - convenient, well-lit, insured, and very reasonably priced.< /text>

Joseph was friendly, organized, professional, and helpful; he even called me the day after I reserved online. It's our 2nd time  - the 1st after our house burned to the ground. We had a  unit for the few things we salvaged and later a parking spot for our little boat. This time we're downsizing with grown kids. It's often a time of change when you store belongings. Our family highly recommends Public Storage as clean, safe always friendly and reasonably priced.</text>< user_id>

They also called after my move in to see how I was doing and if they could help in any way

How often does any company call you after you have paid and see how you are!
They are both always smiling and say Hello who knew how fun it is to have a storage unit with those great employees they are more like friends
If anyone needs a storage unit this is the place!
Thank you Barbra and Iliana

<Rate>5< /Rate><user_id>100462916721629719110<//user_id><Text>This storage facility is outstanding in every way: safe, clean, well lit, convenietly located, has a mix of every size imaginable, with easy access and super parking right adjacent to all the units.

What distinguishes this place the most is the on-site staff of Iliana and Barbara. Both have been with Public Storage.for many years, Barbara for decades, and are extremely knowledgeable, professional and helpful. Barbara lives on-site so there is that additional security.

Iliana is especially friendly and desirous of pleasing all of her customers and will go out of her way to do so. If only everyone had such a caring attitude the world would be a better place. I've rented here for some years now (how time does fly), and could not have made a better selection. Thank you Ilians and Barbara.< /Text><resp>None< /resp><time>1513632068340<//time></record>

<Review>VERY (which doesn't truly cover it) crowded. However I did enjoy mulling around looking at the Various books & other treasures. My nephew & niece LOVED the kids section. The proprietor was quiet but when asked a question he was helpful, pleasant & more than willing to help. Plenty of room to park in the lot as well.  Bought 6 kids books $20. I was pleased.</Review>< rating>

Wonderful place filled to the brim with great books. Plenty for kids, teens, and adults. If they don't have the book you're looking for, they can order it for you at a price better than anything on the internet. Love love love Cameron Books!< /Review>

This bookstore is a gem of the valley. Always helpful, quick order arrival, and an enormous selection to thumb through. You will always find treasure to take home. Thank you for decades of helping our people. Been a customer since my teens.

The owner has endless experience and truly cares about his customers. He will find any book one desires at the least possible to price. He is always a soft-spoken gentle man and a pleasure to do business with. I can't recommend him and his new and used Cameron Bookstore highly enough!<//text>

<rate>5</rate><review>I love this bookstore and the opportunity to explore. There was plenty enough organization to find my field of interest and I could feel my own appreciation added to the wonder of the place, leading me to discover authors I had not read yet.  I also enjoyed the artwork spread through the store & am happy to bring some home with me.  Humanity is losing an intimate part of its soul in the loss of this kind of local bookstore!< /review></record>

<Text>Have been here before looking for used automotive repair manual's. Remembered that only had manuals up to 1995-1999, recently needed manual on a 1995 GM car, went back & sure enough finally found something I could use, one a regular Chilton's but also a big thick Dealer's repair manual. I was very happy
have also purchased a few books relating to history.

Very nice assortment of books, Cameron can order just about any book you want and have it in a few days, and it will always be fair priced. If you ever need to pick up a book for leisure or for school I reccomend this bookstore highly. Fair prices and very nice service!!!<//Review>

This store is so crammed and unorganized. How can you sell a used children's book with writing in it for $12 !? Someone with claustrophobia would flip out in this place. I'm sure the owner is very friendly and obviously loves books, but if you are in here to find children's books or more specifically biblical children's books the selection will leave you wanting. For the enthusiast this place may be great, but for the "drop in" customer like me I would just stick to Amazon. Prices for used books would be cheaper and far better selection.</Text>

These guys are the best! I've used them  for  4 years for general car maintenance  as well as diagnosing a potential electrical issue. They are always professional, thorough, and accommodating. I wouldn't take my car to any other shop.<//text>

After our 2015 Outback's warranty expired, we looked for a shop nearby and found this one. So glad they're around. Professional, clean, fast, and fair. We bought our Outback because pound-for-pound, and dollar-for-dollar, it does exactly what we expect and comfortably. So when we take it to a shop, we want it taken care of right so we don't have to worry about anything down the road. We'll be going here for the life of our Subie.< /review>

<text>The shop was very clean. Smitty was very helpful & efficient. As the work to be performed was going to take some time, Smitty arranged to have a worker (Alex) drive my wife and I home, and then pick us up when the work on the car was completed. Alex is very personable and was easy to talk to. There were no surprises on the bill - what Smitty quoted was the final price. The shop performed a multi-point inspection on the car at no cost. Happily, only a minor item was found. Overall, we were very pleased with the service we received. We would use this shop again.</text><userid>107410698698520724400< /userid>< name>

You don’t feel scared or nervous that they’re trying to screw you they make sure you understand everything they’re doing to your car. They are honest and just amazing. I’m at a loss for words.

I set up an appointment after a recommendation from a family friend. My experience there was beyond my expectations! Krissy provided exceptional service, she was very friendly and professional. She walked me through the repairs needed and how much the cost was. We talked about payment options and made a plan to get the work done. I would 100% recommend if you need work on your Subaru (Honda/Toyota), and ask for Krissy!<//text>

THIS PLACE IS THE BEST HANDS DOWN. Scott and the team there are so patient, helpful, understanding and go the extra mile to break down everything in detail along with the prices and labor prices. We will definitely be giving them our business if we ever need it!! If I could give them more then 5 stars I definitely would. If you are having trouble finding a shop to work on your car this is definitely the spot!! Thank you so much for getting our Hyundai Santa Fe up and running!!< /review>

I've been here twice.  I'm so glad I found this place. It's near my office and not too far from my home.  Customer service is always great.  I came for 1) an oil change and  2) a tire repair.  During the oil change, I was told that an alignment was needed so it was good timing, and their pricing is reasonable.  The tire had a a screw in it, in between the tire treads.  They fixed it - no charge.  And even vacuumed my car and wiped my window! So happy.
Note: I've tried making online appointments.  It's best to call because sometimes the online appointment application is not working well.<//review>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Review>Had an inspection done on a recent purchase here. Turnaround was relatively quick, and the inspection was extremely thorough (it included pictures, measurements, hand written notes, etc.). I would absolutely take a car here for a PPI. That said, based on their quote for repairs I'm guessing their labor rate is slightly above average for Sac. That isn't necessarily a criticism, quality work generates a price premium. But it's good to know what you're getting in to going in.< /Review>< pics>

Great customer service. Lots of options for appointments, price was more than reasonable. But most of all I appreciate the honesty in how they do business. Never try to upsale, they tell you what maintenance may be needed in the future, but don't push... Have recommended SSA to 3 of my family members who have all been as pleased as I.

<review>The mechanics at Specialty Automotive do a great job on all repairs, and I wouldn’t take my Subaru to anyone else. The people in the front office are very professional, even taking pictures of the items that need repair and explaining how they will proceed. I rely on them to keep my vehicle running and give them my highest recommendation.</review></record>

I like the place. It is very near my place. It is kind of pricey but Scott gave me some discount. I would have given you a five star but the supposedly one day service took 3 days. I know it is not your fault because the tires need to be ordered and it did not come on time but at least had given me a heads up so I can rent a car and plan my day accordingly.</Review>

<Text>Scott my service advisor was awesome and informed me every step of the way as to what was going on with my vehicle.. I really appreciate how detailed the inspection report is. The report really gives you insight and helps you make a informed decision on the priority of care your vehicle needs.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Usually a good experience here, I came in for an oil change, was told it’ll likely take 1-1 1/2 hour for it to be done and I was ok with that but, my car has been sitting outside for awhile meaning it’s been done but they just haven’t processed the paperwork so all in all it took 2.5 hours. Was quoted for a cabin filter which my old car doesn’t even have. Then when I came home to check under the hood, the dipsticks for the engine oil and transmission oil both were not latched. Was told that I’ll be needing a rear drum replacement but up to now I still haven’t received the quote that the guy told me he was going to email. They’re not usually this sloppy but I don’t know what happened that day.< /review>

Great customer service and great vehicle service, this location went above and beyond the call of duty, my car needed more work than i thought, which took more time than i thought, they made sure i got to my hotel safely with their shuttle service. They were transparent, the waiting room is very comfortable like an Aquarian vibe. Thanks again for going the extra mile. Your entire team was great!< /text>

<review>I had the best mechanic but he moved out of state so I needed to find a new one.  I looked at reviews, then called and asked to speak to a manager or owner.  The owner was very articulate and explained how they are very transparent.  The day I brought my car in to be checked the service writer was very nice (he asked me “would you like me to wear a mask; we want you to feel comfortable”).  Although the man had excellent customer service skills he wrote up an estimate that was over $2000!  This was after I explained that I don’t have money.  I asked the service manager to review the estimate and I explained my situation to him; he understood and went through the estimate.  In the end the service manager was able to significantly decrease the price.  I might go back I’m not sure yet...  I will say that when I drove my car after they did the inspection and prior to doing the service, the inside was dusty because they left a window open.  I also sent the owner an email and he didn’t respond to it which I’m my humble opinion does not demonstrate good customer service skills.  We will have to see how the car does before I decide whether I will be a repeat customer...<//review>< Pics>

There is one thing I really dislike and it's that office personnel wasn't wearing masks. They were talking to customers without a single mask

At this point, it's not acceptable, just wear your mask.< /review></record>

<text>I just moved into the Davis area from Texas and was looking for a extremely reliable and trustworthy shop to do a pre buy inspection on a Subaru Forester. I was blown away by how polite and friendly Alex was, and how he actually set me down and went through everything on the car, even tho it was all in great condition. After talking about the car, it turns out that they actually specialize in Subaru's and are direct competition with the subi dealers! I have a feeling that if I need anything, I'm going to come back to them!</text>< pics>

I highly recommend this business without hesitation. Thanks again Joe + Team, you guys are second to none.

Took my car in cause my battery died. Those mechanics said my cable was corroded and had to be replaced. Everything was $500. Now I thought about it,  it wasn't even corroded. Should have went my mechanic. Will never go back there< /review>

<text>Scott over at Sacramento Specialty Automotive was extremely professional on the phone, and greeted me right when I pulled in. It was easy to drop off and I was blown away by how thorough their inspections were- each item was photographed and sent to me with the description of service needed and cost. I was able to work with Scott to get all the necessary parts fixed and/or replaced at a very reasonable price. I can’t recommend this place enough, and we will absolutely be using them again!</text>< pictures>

<Text>I've been taking my car here for a couple of years now. The staffs that I've talked to are very polite, professional, and knowledgeable. They do a really good job giving you a thorough inspection even when it's just an oil change. When stuff comes up, they're NOT pushy and try to get you to do additional work on your vehicle right away.

I work within the downtown area (oh yea, they'll drive you to your work and pick you up [if needed]). I recommended this shop to my coworker and they've had similar experience. Will definitely recommend this shop to anyone who needs maintenance on their car.

I should've left this review earlier...</Text>< username>

I had a problem with a turbo charger on my Subaru.  It occurred during the 3 year shop warranty period and they replaced the turbo at no cost.  My Subaru dealer only has a 1 year warranty for a similar service.  I am very happy I had Sacramento Specialty Auto do the work for me.  They picked me up at the airport where I had to leave my rental and even filled the tank for my trip north.  Great customer service!</Review>

<Review>We asked Sacramento Specialty Automotive to inspect our car and provide a complete list of repairs need.  Throughout the process, I felt that the staff was thorough and honest about the major and minor repairs needed.  Because we have an older car, we had a good discussion about the repairs that were needed and whether the car was worth the investment.  They provided good advice and were helpful throughout the process.<//Review>< pics>

Part stores kept telling me my battery was fine, but instead of getting 10 hours of radio play with the engine off, I was barely getting 10 minutes! They told me to get a thorough electrical diagnostic. I turned to Specialty Auto Repair and they did a very thorough diagnosis and told me there was no problem with the electrical system. I got a new battery but if I need it I will certainly go back to them to get a new alternator! Did I mention that they did not charge me for the diagnosis? Well they didn’t! Can’t recommend anyone better! I can trust them and that’s saying a lot!!!<//Review>

This was a “Great Experience” of which I received professional customer service starting with my 1st phone call of which, I spoke with Scott the service manager. He was able to get my car into their shop quickly.   They followed through with everything they said they were going to do and fixed the problem regarding my radiator that had started to over heat from time to time.  They made it very easy to drop off my car and they also provided me a ride back to work in a timely manner.  They diagnosed the problem, contacted me to discuss what they had found was the problem and fixed it at a reasonable price and was able to pick up car by the end of the day!!! I will tell my friends and family to give them a call when they are in need of service for their vehicles.  I will definitely return again for my next vehicle servicing!!!< /review>

<rating>5<//rating><Text>Seriously the best auto shop I have encountered after living in many states. They are efficient, communicate throughout the entire process, are professional, and don’t try to overcharge or convince you to do unnecessary repairs. I trust them completely and am grateful to have found such a wonderful shop to bring my Subaru.</Text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Kale Marzion<//user_name><text>Synthetic oil change, tire rotation and 21 point check for $105 and I waited at the shop and it took less than the hour estimate with a clean bathroom and waiting area with snacks and power outlet.

I didn't have to fend off a bunch of up selling like the uncomfortable business model at Jiffy Lube.

I'm fairly confident their 21 point check is a little more in depth and professional than the high school kids at Jiffy Lube who can't have years of experience as those kids are just getting started in their career.

Thanks again for the great work and peace of mind.

< Review>
I first visited Sacramento Speciality Automotive last week and I am so satisfied with the service they provided! I took my Subaru in knowing that it would likely need many repairs. After the crew looked it over, Krissy approached me with a list of the recommended repairs, their prices, and explained the warranty on the repairs (3 years or 36,000 miles). Krissy also assured me that they use OEM parts where required. My car had to be kept over the weekend and I didn’t have a ride home, so an employee drove me home for free. The work on my car was finished when they said it would be. When I came to pay and pick up my car, my debit card was declined and it took 40 minutes to resolve the issue. Even though it was after hours by this point, Krissy patiently stayed with me until I could pay, and she was very nice about it all. YOU ROCK, KRISSY. When I finally got into my car, I was pleased to find that they had vacuumed the interior for me. I’m very happy with the car and customer service at this place, and I’m so glad that I’ve found a trustworthy auto shop that specializes in Subarus.</Review>

< Review>
I had a great experience. Their employee Alex took the time to explain what was going on with my car in a way that was easy to understand. The pricing is fair and they set you up with an account that rewards you points with every service so you can earn free services. Their shuttle took me to work in the morning after I dropped off my car so I didn’t have to worry about that. They really care about providing quality customer service.< /Review>

<review>These people are amazing. They were something really strange wrong with my car. It has been fixed by the prior owner. I just bought the car.

Sacramento Specialty Auto Repair totally! Stood behind their prior work of a couple months back. They tested the    bushings on the sway bar.  Found it  really dude  need to be replaced.  They replaced it free of charge because it was under warranty.

It's not often a company will stand behind their work, like these people do.

I wouldn't take my car anywhere else but to  Sacramento  specialty Automotive.

The staff are extremely friendly helpful and a pleasure to work with.</review></record>

I’ve had several oil changes and other maintenance done on my Subaru at this service shop and I will never go anywhere else. The overall check is thorough, they send you text updates on your service progress, they email pictures of their findings. Never once did I feel I was pressured into a maintenance that wasn’t needed. They finish on time and do quality work. Prices are of course better than at the dealership and you have access to your car maintenance records. Very professional.< /Text>

<Text>I work downtown and my car had been beeping at me throughout the week and I could not figure out why for the life of me. Not able to catch my usual mechanic soon, I decided to call these guys and I’m so glad I did!
Absolute five star service from the moment I called; Extremely friendly staff and owners, was assisted the moment I walked in, informed promptly of what my car needed to have service on, and I was even driven to work afterwards as I did not feeling comfortable walking in the area.
Highly recommend this shop to anyone, Tanner was extremely helpful and relieved my stress for the day!🙂<//Text>< Pictures>

I never usually take my car to shops because it makes me worry, but for lack of tools I had to stop in for some work on my Subaru. Everyone was very friendly and professional and there was everything from unique sports cars to everyday commuters being worked on inside. They saved me money and took care of some things I was unaware of! Thank you guys I definitely will be returning for my cars needs.< /text>

From start to finish, exceptionally professional and impressive service. I had the pleasure to chat with the owner for a bit - an honest and humble guy who runs an outstanding business! Just moved to Sacramento and am very happy to find a place that I can really trust -  Will certainly be coming again, and recommending to family and friends.</Text>

Great place just down the street from work, too. Can’t believe I never realized they were there!   Very accommodating, efficient and honest. I called and was able to get in the same day. I just got a new set of tires so wanted to check the alignment. No charge for the inspection and received an honest diagnosis.   Will definitely be a repeat/regular customer!<//text>

I really love this place because it doesn't feel like they're ripping me off or lying to me like previous mechanics I've been to. They are always very polite and have never made me feel stupid for my questions. The drinks and snacks they offer in the customer lounge is a nice bonus too. :)< /Review>

Extremely disappointed with my visit here and won’t be coming back. Paid $300 for two separate diagnostic tests, I.e. for a hose clamp to be tightened and to confirm the code for as to why my check engine light is on. The latter of which can be done for free at any auto store. I wanted to get a new catalytic converter so didn’t really question the “diagnostic fees”, as I was told that they could roll over into the work that I would have done. (It was also 8:30am and I am three months postpartum and had the baby waiting) This was all before finding out that a new cat would be 1700, which is interesting because I was told last November that the part itself costs 800 but now suddenly the part costs 1600. Ironically I just received an email this morning from you guys saying that dealers are offering parts for cheaper with all of the COVID stuff happening. To top it all off, I had received a text for 15% off labor and did not receive that discount. When asked, Alex said he would have the owner fix it the next day and it is the next day and I have not received the email receipt with the refund that was promised. I would have chosen to get all my work done here including oil changes and whatnot but after this I will not be returning or recommending that anyone come here. Some “family business” that is really just a scam.</Text>

My car needed some attention,I bought a 2012 Subaru legacy from elk Grove Subaru and I've taken it back to them multiple times and was very unhappy and I refuse to take my car to them again...
I took my car to Sacramento Specialty and I think I am going to be satisfied and if and when my car needs love they will be the one to service my car.
I am glad to know they are there. I would recommend them. . Thank you  for your service!<//review>

SSA completed a head gasket repair on my daughters' newly purchased used car about a year ago. I was thinking about just selling the car but Tanner walked me through the great work they could do at SSA and the car has been working perfect ever since. Everything they do is very well thought out from the visual controls (signs and instructions) in the waiting room to the email, text alerts. Also, they do a great job of visually documenting the proposed repairs so you know exactly what the issues are and if you don't they will take the time to explain it. Great people too.<//text>

<text>Sacramento Specialty Automotive is wonderful. I've had my Honda in for big and small services now, and each time they've taken wonderful care of me and my car. Their pricing is fair and the quality of work is top-notch. They communicate well from start to finish, and made great recommendations. I'm from a small town, and have found nothing like these guys elsewhere outside my home town. I was sent to them by a friend, and have sent friends along to them. A great mechanic is hard to find, and Sacramento Specialty Automotive is a gem.<//text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1533572442310, 'text': "Thanks for the support, Karen.

<text>This is a fantastic shop - they identified the problem with my car, that 2 other mechanics hadn't been able to identify and gave me several options  for repairs that could be completed.  I love that their inspection of your vehicle comes to you via e-mail so you can review that before they call and talk to you about what you want to do.  They also gave me a price breakdown so that I could see exactly what everything cost.   I highly recommend this shop.<//text>< Pictures>

There is nothing more comforting than knowing that special mechanic who you trust with the care of your car. At Sacramento Specialty there is a whole bunch of them! I have been going to SS ( otherwise known as Joe's in my family) for 15 years. They are so knowagable, honest and friendly. I rate them 5+ stars!< /text>

I am new to the Sacramento area and was in need of an auto repair shop. I did some online research and decided to give this place a try. I’m so glad I did! Scheduling an appointment online was quick and easy, they have wonderful customer service (coffee, beverages and snacks in the waiting room, complimentary Uber rides to and from the shop, etc). They got my Subaru all checked out, got the parts needed that day, and I had my car back before they closed that evening! They sent detailed photos of my entire vehicle inspection, and communicated pricing openly and honestly. I highly recommend and I plan I’m bringing my car here always for any maintenance needs.<//Text>

I visited Sacramento Specialty Automotive for new rear brakes. Upon entry, I was very impressed with the cleanliness and size of the facility. I was immediately greeted by staff, and felt very welcomed. I was also provided a ride to and from work.

The pricing for the service, which included an alignment that was later discovered, was competitive and fair. I was blown away at the inspection that was done as the business utilized a website to provide details and images for every point of inspection, and the actual repair process. This left absolutely no doubt in my mind what was needed. The transparency the business provided is unheard of.

I am extremely sastified with the customer service and work done on my Subaru. I will most definitely return for any of future needs. Thank you Sacramento Specialty Automotive!< /Text>

I called to see why my driver side mirror was busted upon picking up my car. They did not reach back to me. I had to call them. I was given the run around and not to mention I was overcharged for the diagnosis by $25. Also when I picked up my vehicle the back near the battery was taken apart and just left in my back seat. A service rep lied to me and blamed a homeless person but I found pieces to my broken mirror inside the locked car upon pick up. He said it was damaged the morning they recieved the vehicle. I had to come back and tow it home the next day. While I was at the shop paying I went to my car to get papers from the glove compartment. There was no damage then. I had to tow it that night after work and that is when I saw the damage. Either way why did they not call and tell me it was damaged? I hate dishonesty and that's what I got here along with being overcharged, and the battery compartment torn apart.< /Review>

<Review>Today was my first experience with Sac Specialty on Richard's.  I brought in a damaged GMC Terrain to them instead of the Dealership.   First the Customer Service was outstanding and the price more than fair.
I was helped by Tanner Brazil and because of his help and expertise,  I will now be a full time Customer at Sac Specialty.
I'm a happy Customer,   Kevin McCart.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><date>1572043377582< /date>< name>

Old review: I bring my 2007 Subaru Forester here. I really like this shop and the people who work here. All the work they have done is great, and they are upfront about all costs. They give me a ride to work when I can't wait, and they keep good track of what has been done/ needs to be done. Great shop, I highly recommend.<//Text></record>

Phenomenal customer service! Although I did not have a vehicle serviced here, I had the pleasure of speaking over the phone with Tanner, who was professional and responsive in returning my calls and answering my questions. I was interested in buying a vehicle at a nearby dealer that showed in its Carfax it was serviced here. Tanner informed me that the vehicle was brought in for a pre-purchase inspection by another potential buyer and had a significant transmission issue. Tanner ended up saving me from booking a flight from San Diego, CA to test drive the vehicle. Honesty and quality customer service drive this business. I wish automotive repair like this was more abundant in San Diego. Thanks again!<//Text>

Tanner and Alex talked to me and told me what would be best to do and could do it for about half the price. On top of that my situation was weird and I asked them how could I get the engine to them because it wasn’t in the car. They didn’t hesitate to respond saying “we got a truck, we can go get it for you” throughout this whole thing I had to call them just about everyday and they were more willing to help with every question and instead of trying to get me to spend money on their shop they tried to help me save as much money as I could. 10/10 would recommend. @Team_Subaru15 will be coming here more often.

We pulled over & called them -- they got us in right away, diagnosed the problem and repaired it and got us back on the road within a couple hours.

After that I have stopped going to any other auto shops and only bring my two cars to Sacramento Specialty Automotive.
They do a great job every time with wonderful customer service. I especially like how everything is detailed when they do any service to my cars, from explaining to even images taken of what needs to be done, then sent to my smartphone.
I highly recommend Sacramento Specialty Automotive for any automotive repair work especially if you are looking for a shop with dealership quality but on the first-name basis approach.<//review><username>Stan Fadyukhin<//username>< userid>

Sadly...our car came there to die. But these people were great clarifying the death sentence. Very quick to diagnose, and even red licorice to sooth our sadness. We don’t live in the Sacramento area, but will refer friends to Sacramento Specialty.< /Text>

<Time>1521902596043< /Time><Rating>5<//Rating><Text>Just got my 2009 Subaru Forester back after four days of loving car care at Sacramento Specialty Automotive shop! Joe and his sons Tanner, and Justin went the extra mile to give me great customer service, valued repairs, trusted car advice and also provided me a rental car for the time my car was in the shop! I had to get the head gaskets done (yes the 10 year old & 100K odometer Subaru owner dreaded repair time), control arm bushings, and they also replaced my water pump and timing belt while they had her all apart for me and an alignment too! The job was done within the time they promised and came in under the original estimate! We take both our Subaru’s here for all services and trust Joe and his family to care for our beloved 2004 & 2009 Subaru vehicles for many years. If you are looking for a great Auto Shop and want to support local family run business this is the Shop for you!!! These guys are the BEST around. Go today you’ll be so glad you did! We LOVE Sacramento Specialty Automotive!!! ❤️✅<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

I found this place by searching online for Toyota mechanics near me. They are highly professional, easy to talk to. They explain things well. They are totally fair  with their pricing, and they have a nice, clean, safe waiting area with t.v. snacks, and beverages. They gave me a ride home, most importantly , they do highly professional and prompt work in keeping our 2006 Sienna running.< /Review>

< Review>
I was looking for a Subaru mechanic for my 2006 Outback, which after 130,000 miles had an engine that was leaking oil, stinking up the inside with a bad smell, and developing other mechanical problems.  I had it checked out with a different repair shop I've used for my other cars, but this time it seemed like they didn't quite know what they were doing.  I was finally informed that I needed a new head gasket, which is a big expensive ($2500) job.  After making some phone calls,  I was pleased to discover that Sacramento Specialty Automotive could offer me a higher quality gasket and do the work I needed to have done for $500 less than either my regular repair shop or the Subaru dealer.  To boot, they did my timing belt and water pump, cleaned up some corrosion, changed other minor gaskets, and replaced my air filter and spark plugs for no added labor cost.  While the major work was underway, I was able to add a brake job and have some needed front suspension work done (bushings and ball joints) with the money I saved by choosing this repair facility.   Now my car no longer leaks, no longer stinks, and drives like when I bought it.  No one, including me, likes to spend $3,000 on auto repairs.  However, since a Subaru can last for 250,000 miles, I believe in the long run, it's more economical to fix it than to replace it.  The guys at Sacramento Specialty Automotive communicated well with me at every step of the process, and are super-efficient in what they do.  They inspected my vehicle, sent me a detailed report with photos, got the engine out of the car and disassembled, had critical parts machined, reassembled the engine, put it back in the car and road tested it in under four days.  Who can do that anymore?  These guys are professionals who know the Subaru and understand what they are doing.  If I ever need serious work done on my Outback again, this is where I'm taking it.<//Review>

I've been bringing my Subaru's here for over a decade.  Joe, Tanner, and the whole crew are knowledgeable,  professional,  honest, trustworthy, and personable.  I've bought cars from them, had them handle repairs and check ups, and even used them to buy my tires. They know Subaru's and are a strong small town family shop.  I like that.  My cars all run great thanks to their great preventative and curative skills.< /Review>

Wow, I had truly given up on finding a great autocare spot, and SSA has really impressed me beyond all expectations. They are committed to fostering great relationships with customers. That is the best thing about them. Each employee I've dealt with has been patient and understanding and never pushy about getting work done, they are honest and will let you know what can and cannot wait as far as services if you need to budget. At most places, in the past, if a mechanic has made a mistake, I've had to try to convince them to take responsibility, been frustrated, and reduced to tears. When I brought a mistake to their attention Jason assured me he would discuss it with management and get things sorted out, and they swiftly, humbly took responsibility, kept me safe, and assured me that over anything, that's what they care about most, safety and satisfaction. I trust them. That's so important to me, and that's why I feel great about returning to their shop for all my service. Speaking of which, the shop is awesome. The waiting room is so comfortable. They have plenty to snack and drink on while you wait, a small library, television, wifi, comfy couches, place to charge your phone. They will chat with you and catch up if they have time, or they will leave you alone if you just want to wait in silence. Someone even left fresh peppers and tomatoes from their garden for guests to take, last time I was in! I love it. If you need to be walked through their service, or need any explanation of what they've done, no one is too stupid for them, they have the kindness and patience to explain things in a way you can understand and they really do care about earning your trust. I love to support businesses like this. I'm so grateful this has been my experience with them and for anyone that hasn't had a similar experience, I would try to discuss what can be done to make it right, as they truly do want to operate with contientious intent. Much love to everyone there, they don't make places like this so often, and I am glad I found it.<//review>

<Review>I was there in office for 6/7hrs(left around 1/2pm), having got there before opening (7:30) for:
Vehicle Health Inspection
CABIN AIR FILTER - Labor
Diagnose Driveability Concern
Alignment, Four Wheel - Labor
I was not offered any information until billing, in the middle of billing, in the office I was told to leave so he could take and do another customer while I had been there all morning. Then when they were done I was asked to come back and choose the services I wanted done. I was then made to wait an additional several hours for the delivery of the air filter I was told "should be here soon". Office staff had seen me there the entire duration and other customers came and went though offered me no word until after I paid and was about to leave. In the meantime, others were offered services to get home and come back later. I was then told by someone who didnt introduce themselves with either a name or a position that they were sorry for my experience and it's not how things get done. I said thank you, left and dont intend on coming back. The prices were high though I kept thinking to myself, they're professionals. I was made to feel as though they were only there for the cars, not the people driving them.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Text>In the near 20 years that you all at Sacramento Specialty Automotive have been servicing my car, you have never just met my expectations; you have always exceeded them, and I have had all those years of peace knowing that 1. A family-owned business; 2.  Honest and 3  Highly capable people were dealing with my car.  For this you are all very much appreciated.
Thanks.

I’ve been bringing my 14 Impreza here for 40K miles now, and I now bring my wife’s new 17 Forester in too. Even when we moved 55 miles away to the hills, I still make the trip to Sac Specialty for my service work. Honest and friendly employees, fair pricing, and great work performed. I’ve never picked up my car and not been 100% satisfied with the experience.</review>

I strongly feel that Sac Specialty Auto is the best in the business. All of the staff were very courteous despite my irritability with the situation, and they went above and beyond to help me solve the issue -  digging up service records from across the country, getting the car over to Ford, convincing them to extend my warranty, setting me up to get picked up by a rental (with Sac Specialty's discounted rate even added in). I picked up my car this afternoon and couldn't be happier with the work that was done - It's driving better now than on the day I bought this pre-owned Fiesta! Thank you!!!<//Review>< resp>

I have been to Joe's shop many times as I own multiple vehicles. I have recommended Joe's shop to many friends and we all agree; It is clean in appearance, customer focused upon arrival, solid feedback on our vehicles and the needed repairs.  Helped us prioritize the work with no pressure, just facts and advice as requested. I was correct when I stated this will be a long term business relationship.<//Text>

I really appreciated the professionalism in communications about what was needed for my 2007 Suby Outback, and the clean and organized shop reinforced that.  Also, they went out of their way to help me with transportation while my car was there.  A week and a couple hundred miles after picking up the car, everything seems perfect!<//review>

<review>My 2012 Mazda needed servicing and I called up these folks.  They worked me into the schedule, texted and emailed me with updates. The updates had pictures of tires and brakes that needed replacing. Job was finished that day. Service and waiting areas are spotless and the attention to detail was impeccable. While I hate spending money on cars for any reason, I totally feel that I got professional and friendly service that well warrated the cost.< /review><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<review>The overall experience is excellent and efficient. I like the fact that you can monitor the status of the car on their website and make appointments and also keep track of previous maintenance status.

At the workshop itself, the check-in process is fast and Tanner gives you a detailed breakdown of what work needs to be done, along with upfront costs which is great.

Finally Joe gets the job done real well and gives you full detailed analysis along with pictures of what needs to be done for the car in the next maintenance trip.

Overall this has to be worth a 5star for the services provided.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None</Resp><gmap_id>0x809ad72e0504f529:0x4bde20b1e839fed9</gmap_id></record>

I showed up and Sara was the first person to open the door and greet me. She then sat me down in her office and went over their process and procedures (very helpful). Coming in for an oil change and tire rotation, they did a full scan of my vehicle from top to bottom, gathered pictures and evidence, and did a comprehensive summary of things that need current attention, things that checked out, and things to be on the look out for. I felt their pricing was very reasonable and they definitely compete with others around.  They have a super clean facility, lounge area with snacks, drinks, and wifi for their guests. Oh, and they have a couple extremely well behaved dogs hanging out in the lounge with you :) Overall, they have my business for the long-term! First impressions matter, especially when it comes to car maintenance, and they IMPRESSED me! Highly recommend!< /Text>< Pictures>

Fantastic service and trustworthy.
I needed work done on my Subaru and fast. I was unable to make an appointment the night before but Alfas Subaru fit me into their busy schedule. I am extremely grateful for their excellent service and trustworthy quotes.
Speaking with the front desk and tech staff is easy and comforting.
I look no where else in town when I need work done on my Subuaru.
Thank you.<//Review>

<rate>5</rate><text>Amazing experience. I took my car here for a tire checkup/repair as the driver side tire started to drop air pressure levels drastically. Initially i thought this shop like any other small repair shops that i had experiences with in the past 4 years where i would go for oil change or multi point check or tire issues etc and almost all the time i walked out of the shop not even knowing any details of whats going except the billing details. At Sacramento specialty automotive i had a totally different and amazing experience as the technology they use , the apps they use is amazing where you have access to pretty much everything about your car and what they are doing to your car which shows the transparency and gives you a sense of confidence that your car is in good/safe hands. I never felt such a thing even with my dealership/service center where i purchased my car, and i was surprised to see what the big dealerships are not offering these days are offered by this shop, let it be the information and pictures they share with you through the app, or let it be the pricing and the customer service, the free drops and pickups, just amazing, they are doing best honest job, i definitely see they will be more and more popular in years to come and even big dealerships might want to tie up with them for they have and capable of. I should definitely mention about Sara Savio who was my service advisor , she is very knowledgeable about her work and it was easy to talk to her. Her way of treating customers was friendly. Last but not least I would definitely recommend this shop for your car, i personally prefer transparent and honest people,even if they are a little pricey, however this shop was reasonable pricing. I would definitely recommend Sacramento specialty automotive.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< response>

So I have had mixed experiences here. Had the head gasket replaced at a high but fair price. Brought my 2002 outback bake to have the CV and axle fixed, they immediately added tons of other services (2 hours to replace a light bulb?) that ballooned the price to 10x the initial estimate. BE VERY CAREFUL!!! If the owner is not in you are WALKING INTO A DEN OF THIEVES. Have everything itemized and e-mailed to you before they touch your car.<//text>

These folks are terrific. They've serviced all of my Subarus and my gal pal Rodeo for more than 15 years. They always explain in detail what the problem is alone w/ an estimate.

I'm miss having them at the downtown location (Marco, where ever you are, I still want that Alfa) but the distance isn't too far.

I donated a dead vehicle to them and appreciated their assistance with that as well.< /Review>

<Name>Alicia Sanhueza</Name><review>Oh man, I owe these guys (especially Will and Alex) big time. I purchased a 2006 Subaru Outback XT from Ashur Motors in Orangevale in September 2016 (AVOID AT ALL COSTS). I won't even begin to explain what all has gone wrong with this awful car ($6700 in repairs), but let's just say it's been so many things that Sac Specialty knows my car pretty darn well. Everything from a sensor that stranded me on the I-80 to a power steering pump and rack, these guys have put an amazing effort into getting me up and running. As someone that didn't know much about cars, they were always willing to talk through things with me and what was necessary and what could be postponed.

After having a hell of a year, it was extremely comforting knowing that there was a shop I could rely on to make me feel safe in my own car. Still don't believe me? On my way up from San Diego back to Sacramento my check engine light and sensors went off. I was moving up to Portland the next day. *Cue melt down*. After a phone call to Will and a "sure, come on in", I brought the car in where they flushed the system, adjusted a few things, and made sure the car was 100% safe to get up north. It made it to Portland, and KNOCK ON WOOD it's still chugging along.

Seriously, thank you Will and Alex and Sac Specialty. You guys are a dime in a dozen.</review>< time>

<date>1460750745163</date><Rate>1<//Rate><Text>Whoa! I just called for an estimate that was $100-$150 over the DEALER price. When I called back to ask about the price discrepancy, they said it was because they used factory parts. Wait a second, isn't that what the dealership does? The dealer also said that it takes two hours, not 2.5 hours to complete the job. If you want to pay too much and get lied to, then by all means choose this place. Both Maita Subaru and Elk Grove Subaru are far cheaper.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Response>{'time': 1462294109897, 'text': "It's impossible to give an accurate estimate over the phone. When comparing pricing it's important to compare based off a written quote and as we don't have a record or history of estimate being built for your vehicle it's possible we were not quoting for exactly the same work. Typically we are less expensive than the dealer as our labor rate is lower. Prices on parts are usually the same if not slightly lower because we do use OEM parts. We'd be happy to bring you and your vehicle in so you can see the benefits of our shop and we can provide a complimentary inspection/quote quote for what your vehicle needs. We're a family-run shop and our business model and philosophy is built on honest customer service and transparency at every level - to do it any other way would be shooting ourselves in the foot!"}< /Response>< gmapID>

I have had mixed feelings with this this company. Some really awesome, and some questionable, just to be honest! First time I brought my car to them I left it in the parking g lot after hours, and they made that a very seemless system. Then the service was amazing they gave me a few different options to fix the hill holder that broke. I took the cheap option because I'm on a budget. It's nice of them to give me that option, some would just make you spend more even if you didn't need to. Then they check the rest of the car and found I needed to get my head gaskets fixed. So I did that. They did a great job. Here's where the BAD came in....one of the techs stole cash out of my car! So I called and they were very apologetic and offered to refund what ever was gone, and offered to "hook it up" next visit via oil change ect.. Great service. Then about 900 miles after they fix the head gaskets my radiator cracked. So I went back without an appointment and they got my car right onto the shop and fixed the radiator, and didn't charge me for anything! About $280. All in all I am very happy with everyone that works for the company, they are great people. It all stems from the owner and his son, the Brazil's. I will definitely go back in the future, and I suggest you do the same.</review>

I love this place. They do clean work, the prices are fair, and they truly enjoy working on the Subaru brand. I have had my 1997 Impreza's engine get all new seals and gaskets, the A/C tuned for summer, some steering work, new all four coil-overs installed, replaced a clogged EGR, new air mass flow meter, and a few oil changes. They fixed some damaged electrical stuff a different audio/alarm shop messed up and put a new fog light switch in when I added a fog light bar.
My wife also takes her 2010 Outback here for servicing.
I have never been over-houred for work that took them longer because they messed up. My car has had a few strange issues that took them longer than normal and they didn't bill me for those hours. After the total engine removal and re-install for the seals and gaskets there was only a single mistake, a ground wire was not reattached. I drove back and they stopped everything and put two mechanics on it to solve it. That is pretty awesome!< /text>

Nice little subway tucked away so not so busy, might have got 5 stars if it had restrooms!< /Text>

Carlos was very rude, one of my friends dropped her cup for her drink, when i asked Carlos if he could exchange it he stated because we dropped it he couldn't exchange the cup. I asked him if he expected me to drink from the cup that had fallen on the floor and was now contaminated with germs from the floor where people had walked on, his response again was he didn't drop it we did therefore he would not exchange it.  I asked him for his supervisor/manager, he stated he was the person in charge. After about five minutes of going back and forth and told him that was a health violation, he exchanged the cup.  I don't feel that was ethical.</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very dissatisfied, my husband is diabetic and was hungry. We went to this subway only for Crystal one of the employees to tell me they were on break and to come back in 20 minutes. I have the cynicism of sending me to the Atlantic when they are around the corner from my house. All because they want to be socializing. Handler could you answer if this is a constant practice?

This establishment IMHO while ultra-convenient and a kinda anchor-safety zone amidst the 'ol downtown area replete with the usual accoutrements of the underserved (especially after sunset) might cause one to stretch their reserve tank fumes. BUT hey: that's life in the bright lights/big city = a big, gritty welcome to the "elle bee" (baby).....!!!!!< /text>

<Text>Employees are kind and tend to go above and beyond basic customer service which is highly appreciated. Competitive pricing ensure your getting bang for your buck. Personally, I like to use my credit card at gas stations to receive benefits from my card how ever the only downside to ARCO is they do not accept ANY form of credit.</Text></record>

Small but very helpful.  I purchased gas there one morning and my car didn't start because my battery died, the attendant help me and washed my windows.  Their coffee is always fresh, and the people that work there are very nice.  they always greet their customers.< /text>

Great place for a party! Great price. I would suggest 150 seated guests max. Otherwise it gets a bit crowded, unless you rent the patio too. The Saturday staff has always been really kind and helpful.</Text>

<review>Enrolled my baby in a Parent-Toddler class here. The class description said minimum age was 18 months. He joined the class on his 18-month birthday and turned out to be the most traumatic event of his life. The class is more appropriate for 2.5 years+. It involves taking instruction on tumbling and gymnastics - no play or singing.
When I went to cancel, I told them my son would arrive to the parking lot and scream and cry bloody murder. I had to pull him out. The staff had no concern for the well-being of my son. So, for cancelling, they charged me half the price of what I had paid even though my son couldn't participate in any of the two classes he tried to go to.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x808fcdc975073baf:0xffdf95950cea4743< /gmapID></record>

It's a great spot next to a park but I think it's getting too small for the area</Review>

The residents attending (11/26/2017) tonight's meeting were rude and didn't give Dave Cortese a chance to speak without shouting and interrupted the meeting.</text>

Also, $2 Tuesdays is great. Burgers for a couple bucks. Can't beat that. I think it's seasonal though, so don't expect it year round.</Review>< Pics>

< Review>
Made a last minute day trip to Santa Cruz with my husky & I was so hungry I didn't want to wait an hour and a half to eat brunch. I found US Meal because they were listed as dog friendly. The food here was really good and comforting and the service was fantastic. It's a solid burger joint & they have really good sweet potato fries and fried pickles. Definitely a spot to check out when your in town.< /Review>

This place is great. The burgers are the best & you get a ton of fries. The fish & chips are my favorite, but I also like the chicken strips. Actually, everything is good there. The owners & employees are nice & seem to care about their customers. I highly recommend this place. You won't be disappointed!<//review>

<rating>5< /rating><review>Tasty fair-priced juicy burger and the regular fries are for sharing. It was served fast like within 10 minutes. Loved how they fries were a lil crisp on the outside, which is how I like it. (I do not like complete soggy/soft fries).

There is a nice patio seating inside, and only one TV inside, which I prefer. You can focus on eating with each other vs  getting majorly distracted with a TV.

Would definitely come back here a lot more times.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Text>Casual, local family-run, simple, Americana burger joint with formal, 'please-wait-to-be-seated' restaurant prices...
Pros: Burger was cooked just right and tasted spectacular! The fries are fresh and you get a lot of 'em! The outdoor seating in the garden is really a nice place to eat on a nice day, with lots of tables and plenty of room. The staff is friendly and the food was ready in not much time at all.
Cons: They do not offer, make or sell milkshakes. All in all, the main aspect of my visit that caught me off guard the most was, my bill. The food is rather expensive. A burger with fries, ordered together as a "meal" is just that, a burger and fries, nothing else. So, a meal, plus a regular soft drink (self serve, so refills are included) rounded out to just about 15 dollars, add the tip because the service was good and my regular sized 'order-for-one' ran me close to 20 bucks! IMHO, If I was able to order a regular milkshake (or better yet, a malt) with my burger and fries, then I would have expected a decent sized check. But hey, prices are only gonna keep getting higher, and you really can't get any more Americana than that... Maybe this is a sign that I'm officially 'getting old'.... 🙁 ... At 34... 😕 ...NAH! 😎 ... that'll never happen to me... 😁 ... 🤫 ... 😉👍 ... 🤘🤡<//Text>< Pictures>

Good food, very reasonable prices, and good service.  It's an order-at-the-counter type of place, but the order is brought to the table. The box lunches are a great bargain at $5, which includes hamburger, fries, and a cold bottle of water.  Definitely a good place to go. It's casual, focuses on the food instead of a fancy interior, and has a good patio, too.</review><Rating>5<//Rating></record>

Let me just say that the costumes service is fantastic, but the food was okay. It wasn't anything too special. The uncooked bun wasn't good, it kept tearing and I was eating with a quarter of a bottom bun because the bun falls apart. They give an okay amount of food for the price, I thought it was a little over priced. What bothered me the most was a burger is 8 dollars and your going to pay almost 5 dollars for some fries. Maybe it was just me but the way they served the burger was horrible, it was on such a small basket and made it hard to eat the burger. This place is nice if you like to sit outside and don't really care for a well rounded restaurant. A LOT MIXED VIBES COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER</Text>

<userid>103400934657386752424</userid><Review>Forget this place exists. I worked there for a time and I got tired of receiving pay checks for 9/hr even though that's illegal and they hired me at 12.

Also with regards to their food I just went to get a turkey avocado miso burger for roughly 8 bucks. They forgot both the avocado and the miso giving me an 8 dollar turkey patty in some over buttered toast. I called them to let them m ow because it isn't the first time this has happened, and I was told they were out of miso but just didn't feel the need to tell me.

By the time I get there the manager has left, the bugger is cold, and they left me 2 small strip of avocado stuck to a piece of plastic.

Don't eat here. Don't work here. Dont send people here. There are dozens of better and cheaper places in walking distance of this one.</Review><gmap_id>0x808e154af501bac9:0xc644b4bc036fded9<//gmap_id><rating>1</rating>< pics>

<review>Thank you Olivia, Joseph, Roberto and everyone else in the Gridiron family! Delicious food, and amazing prices every day! I am amazed by their customer service and willingness to remedy any issues that may arise (thankfully they are rare!) I will always recommend Gridiron, they have the best pizza in silver lakes! Also, tried a mushroom and alfredo Calzone for the first time today! Amazingly delicious!<//review>< Pictures>

<Time>1615597682994< /Time><Rating>2< /Rating><Review>Today I had the worst costumer service experience offered by the older petite cashier with straight black hair. I was there @3:41 - 3:55 til i walked out.  Walking in, i was greeted with a stare down from her, with no welcome greeting. On top of it, she had NO MASK. I grabbed a to-go menu and seated myself . About 10 minutes into talking to my boyfriend about completing our thoughts of our very large order, she interrupted our conversation by saying "Are you going to order or not", . Well, we simply replied "yes", and she really just walked away with a staring glance. Thats when we decided take our Dough 10 minutes down road 66' to CROSS EYED COW! #Love #Honor/Respect #Covid19safe #Friday</Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I came in today to try the wings and they have horrible costumer service. I regret my decision on even coming. There was a girl I believe that her name was Kelly or kessy something like that. She was so rude and made us feel unwelcome. The food was good but the costumer service needs to be fixed< /review>

The cashier ROSA is super friendly, patient and considerate of her customers. I dont live out here and she made it feel like we were family. she answered all our questions very respectfully it was a pleasure eating here. The cooks ROBERTO and SANDRA are legit cooking up heavenly products back there. The food is super amazing trust me the pizza places where I live do not live up to the standards gridiron presents to customers. The whole place just felt super clean. I appreciate everyone that works here thank you very much for the amazing and pleasant exexperience.<//Text>

Nothing but great things to say about THE Gridiron Pizza. Ricardo and Joseph provide excellent customer service with every order/delivery. My personal favorite is the Signature pizza and the garlic cheesy bread is always delicious.The cooks, who I believe are named Roberto and Sandra, are amazing cooks. Always satisfied whenever ordering from Gridiron Pizza.</Review>

We grab pizza (and usually a side order of boneless wings or breadsticks) from Gridiron about once a month and always get great food and great service, either through carry out or delivery. Joseph, their delivery driver, is super nice, punctual and professional. We’ve always had great experiences and we’re happy to have another option for dining out here in Silver Lakes.</Review>

<text>Stopped in here to waste sometime watch sports, drink beer and eat some pizza. It was unexpected  an awesome experience! Unexpected because I had never been here before and did not know what to expect. Service is friendly and top notch, great food, clean, big TVs, and the view of the lake with sunset was spectacular! I highly recommend!</text><Time>1579059199920<//Time><user_id>109269607493141012945</user_id><Resp>None<//Resp></record>

Recently moved to the neighborhood so I was craving some pizza.  There are two pizza spots in Silver Lakes.  This place is OK, at best.  The quality of the pizza just wasn't that great.  I ordered a large pizza and it was their version of supreme.  The toppings weren't great.  The sausage came in little cubes and the cheese wasn't that great.<//review>

The best pizza and wings you can buy. The customer experience is also beyond exceptional. Delivery or pick up Gridiron is the way to go. Don’t forget to tip your driver!!!</Review>

Helendale Gridiron Team is THE BOMB.
I have never had an issue with them or the food.
The food is outstanding, best wings in the area and you can't beat the prices. They have amazing customer service, friendly faces and a great atmosphere for any occasion. I would highly recommend them no matter if you take out or dine in.
The delivery guy is always on time and follows up to make sure you are happy with your orders.

You guys are great !</Text>

Order was over an hour late.  Food was cold and hard when it was finally delivered.  Manager never took my call and all the delivery guy and girl on the phone said was we'll put in for you to get 20% off your next order.  I don’t intend to reorder from you so that’s a joke.</review>

Impressively delicious pizza. I always order pepperoni mushroom, well done. The pizza’s are consistent and packed with lots of flavor. The folks that work there are very nice. Wish we could order online, and their website is a little wonky, but all that comes with time.<//Text>

Great spot to stop and have lunch. Love the service provided from the moment you walk in. Reasonable prices for the portion sizes. They are also always seen at the local school events, giving the best game side snack. Thank you for another pizza spot for our small town.< /Text>

I have never had a bad experience with Gridiron pizza. The pizza is always spot on and is consistently delicious every time I order. The best thing about this location is it’s unrivaled customer service, the staff is always so patient while taking orders and let you know if they are having any deals to help save you money and the delivery driver that I deal with almost every time (Charlie) is always on time, friendly, and very polite.<//review>

<text>This place has the most delish cheesy garlic bread! And the boneless buffalo wings are yummy too. And now they have ice cold beer on tap!

<review>I have to say that I recommend this place, not only is the pizza delicious and fresh, but another thing I noticed was the hospitality there is awesome. The waitress there his name is Benji was very sweet and attended to our every needs. I highly recommend this place in for good time with your family. The restaurant has a nice set up as well.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Ordered some sandwiches the other night that were not the greatest, so my BF wrote a review about it and the owner reached out to him to make it right. He offered to give us a credit for our entire order and re-make the sandwiches. We decided to take him up on his offer, but instead of sandwiches we just asked for some wings (WE LOVE THE WINGS) and we’ll call it even. The owner agreed and hooked us up with a bunch of wings and some zucchini sticks! We are more than satisfied with the outcome and are thankful the owner is a real stand up guy!! We’ll give the sandwiches another try eventually, but for now we’ll definitely keep coming back for those wings and that lake front view!!</review>

Benji and Roberto are very helpful and ensure that everything that I was requesting was explained to me so that I got what I was looking for. I came in I believe this is probably my fifth time to get food for me and my crew. Everybody on the crew always loves the pizza great service great food great customer service.</review>

2nd visit and Grid Iron Pizza is my favorite pizza place!  Moved from Colorado recently and wasn’t sure we’d find a new “regular” spot but the food is awesome and the staff is great! May become a weekly ritual.</text>

We really enjoy going to gridiron, Roberto and staff are absolutely awesome. The best restaurant customer service here in silverlakes hands down. Pizza is great, wings are great, and love their subs and garlic bread. And  on top of all that, they are the most reasonably priced restaurant here! They have only been in our community for a few months and have donated their time, money, and food to our local community and youth sports. I really hope they stay here for many years to come. THANK YOU GRIDIRON, for making silverlakes an even better place to live!<//text>

They went way out of their way to deliver fast, hot, great tasting food!  The driver Charlie seems happy to be able to deliver to our small community!< /Text>

My name is Reliant, but my friends call me Rin, introduction aside l like this place! It's like a classic hang out for helendale that was much needed, the pizza may be a dime a dozen to others who prefer a certain touch on cuisines, but I come for the good people and good times, I bring my sister and brother sometimes when we have the extra dough to spend, the crew at work is nice! Benji is doing his best and as a man of the hustle myself I respect that, I used to know the cook trey when the twisted chicken was still around so this place has memories for me, but hey, pizza is pizza!<//review>

We ordered for pickup on Saturday night.  The order was ready when they said it would be.  The sausage pizza was awful, it had hardly any sausage, cheese, or sauce,  it was very dry.  The pepperoni one was a little better but very little pepperoni.  The boneless wings were good and so was the bread sticks.  Very disappointed.

<Text>Out of all my years of living in silver lakes I’ve always thought Fratellis had the best pizza but then my friend had introduced me to gridiron never again will I go back to Fratellis. Gridiron has the BEST pizza I’ve ever eaten and there prices are very good unlike the other place.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><gmapID>0x80c3837703d4d943:0x2d5846159c2742f6</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Text>fantastic place, me and my brothers family came to eat at a neighbored restaurant next to gridiron and waited for a hour and fifteen minutes with out food and then when asked about where our food was they replied with “I don’t know we are busy” so we walked out and when to gridiron and was severed our food in under 20 minutes, thank you for being a life saver gridiron, I’m not happy when I’m hungry and tired. 😂<//Text>< Time>

I dined into grid iron with my three accomplices and I had a very exquisite experience, the pizza has the finest of Brie de Meaux cheese on my perfectly 8 slice pie. The workers of grid iron but the ones that stood out were Benji and Zaira they put so much effort into there hard working job making this place really live up to my expectations. -Carson,Logan, & Sammy
