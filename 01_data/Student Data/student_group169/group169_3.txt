<Time>1620265957171</Time><rating>5<//rating><review>This is quaint restaurant with a nice atmosphere. There is a spacious outdoor patio. They have live plants throughout giving out a nice vibe. The staff is friendly and attentive. The Butternut Squash Pizza is delicious. I am not vegan but the vegan root pizza was very tasty. The spicy agave wings are incredible, I highly recommend them. The in-house made garlic aioli it is addictive.< /review>< pics>

<Text>My favorite are the Chicken Wings!!! DELICIOUS. Crispy and Spicy. That garlic aioli is to die for.  It would sound like I love chicken because the next favorite is the Spicy Chicken Sandwich with fries. Pizza is great, dough is soft and chewy.  I love supporting my neighborhood small business owners.</Text>< user>

I came to the restaurant through a friend's recommendation. I'm so glad she told me about it! The ambiance is beautiful inside and outside.  The service was great. Everyone had masks on. Tables 6 feet apart.  FYI, the plates and utensils are biodegradable! How awesome is that!! Even the owner came out to greet us!</text>

<Review>Order a cheese, a pepperoni and a margarita pizza for my family. We were not disappointed. The pizzas here are made using all fresh ingredients, from the vegetables to the cheese, they are delicious. I'm so glad I found them, they are now our favorite pizza place. Can't wait to try their other items, everything looks so good.< /Review>< UserId.>

I had an outstanding meal! Pizza, wings, chicken sandwich, all the hits, all the classics. They have the most incredible ranch it will blow your mind. Staff is super friendly, and there is a great atmosphere. A vibe for sure.< /Review>

This is the only place I have seen butternut squash pizza on the menu and I love it. They make it to perfection! I've also had the root vegetables which are a unique combo, and are perfectly crispy, tangy, and with a little kick.
I can't wait for them to open for in-person dining. Both the inside of the restaurant and the outdoor patio are very pretty and inviting. The staff is awesome!
I always order from there when I'm in the area. I wish it were closer to me.<//review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOh11bTcOMJDofFN8CsLeng2ICk25jCMLw45sem=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNSQew9tOna2ut1i7v9A4Fw6A7bVs7OA3EWyA2h=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><resp>None<//resp><gmapID>0x80c295dd03302bd5:0x48644e6150f68dfc</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>AMAZING!  We're so glad they're open and ready for us! We enjoyed dinner there last week for the first time and I'm so happy to have such a fantastic place to eat, so close to home. You can always judge a pizza by its dough..and this one wins. Hands down.. the best! My kids loved it...all of them, and that says a lot. I highly recommend and we will be going back!< /text>< pics>

So glad we stopped to have the delicious roasted roots & beets salad and artisan pizzas (wild mushroom and fennel sausage). Really appreciated the eco friendly plate and utensils, glass of cool water to the table, great service, and lighted outdoor dining. Very good price point. How about a seasonal menu of pizza, salad, appetizer, etc., ingredients that are in season? A gem in Burbank.<//review>

I went here because it was on a list from my moms Facebook group as local restaurants we would be sad if it were closed. The staff was friendly. The food was really  good. I got there early after I called in and they made a concerted effort to get my food to me quicker and spent time just chatting with me while I waited. This is now a restaurant that I would be sad if it was closed.< /text>

<review>Incredibly impressed by their food!!! We got the truffle mushroom and margarita pizzas with an artichoke app. Everything was so fresh and flavorful, the artichoke was the best I've ever had, melted in our mouths, and the ranch (lemon garlic aoli) I must mention because it had a hint of lemon zest, and it was such a delicious element. This may be the best pizza in LA. Don't miss out. Tell your friends! They opened during covid. Wish I would have found them sooner.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80c295dd03302bd5:0x48644e6150f68dfc< /Gmap_id><Date>1615771133398</Date>< username>

<Text>It was an above average pizza.  Crust was a little chewy, cheese and sauce were great, "old world" pepperoni needs more flavor.  At $18 it's a solid pizza, one that hits the spot but isn't something I'd seek out or rave about to friends.</Text>< Name>

I was visiting some family in the area (I live pretty far away), but saw that this restaurant was open and wanted to bring some food over to my aunt's. I picked up the "Creamy Shrimp Pesto Pizza" and was very happy with the results. Each piece of shrimp was larger than I expected it to be, but hey, I'm not complaining! When I come back to the area again, I will definitely stop by! Also, the outside had a lot of areas to take cute pictures. I have a feeling this restaurant will be the next trendy "go-to" spot for many, so I'm glad I found this place before it starts blowing up! I'm excited to see the growth and changes to come once dining is allowed again.</Text>

The service and staff at Life Rooted are so kind! When I was coming by to pick up, I saw each employee following social distancing guidelines, so that definitely made me feel more comfortable. I was waiting there for five minutes tops, and saw an employee constantly wiping down the counters and register. Everyone was wearing a mask and things seemed to be running smoothly. The interior design looks upscale and family friendly, I can’t wait to dine-in with my friends very soon! As for now, I am happy with the adjustments they have made for take-out and delivery.< /review>

Horrible service. Rude manager. Waiting time to go was over an hour. Left without the food. Waisted my time and effort. There were 5 people waiting their food and we're very unhqppy. Waiting time was enourmosly long. Manager, was lost , had no idea what he was doing. He refunded one person for pizza, for he could not make on in time. Avoid this garbage place. You can get better pizza and better service elsewhere. -10 negative stars.</Text>

Tried the fennel sausage pizza. Very good! Personal preference-I’d ask to sub the leeks. Also, would really be happy if they added an anti pasta salad. We missed having one with our pizza. Still, very very yummy!</Review>

<Review>I usually don't review or give my opinion, but I was compelled to say something about this place!
It's like having an upscale Beverly Hills restaurant right here in Burbank.
The attention to detail in every dish, my god, the pizza crust, the salads...
can't say enough. I think one reason is they have a very specific menu, it's not pages long so they can focus on gourmet dishes and not a bunch of secondary dishes.
Look, it's not on a hill overlooking the city, it's on Glenoaks, but the interior is upscale and there's a window looking into the kitchen in the waiting area, how many restaurants have that much confidence in their chef. Save your time and money going to Beverly Hills, eat here!<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

I have been watching this new restaurant being built for the past year and it is finally open! They did a really nice job. Food is at a reasonable price and portion size is good. I would say a pizza is good for 2 to share if not too hungry, throw in a salad and you should be fine. Flavors are great and the honey drizzle on the Sopressata Pizza is amazing. Kale salad is a must try! Service is friendly and clean environment. Coming back soon!</review>

I love this pizza.  They have regular pizzas and artisan pizzas. Good for the whole family.The sandwiches are awesome and the salads are unique and the dressing is amazing. We love the new decor, it's completely remodeled and modern now.<//text>

Although Life Rooted is mainly recognized for its pizzas, I also praise them for their Italiano sandwich. It is by far my favorite item on the menu and I suggest everyone give it a try. Life Rooted is also a very new restaurant that has only been around since this year, however, they have managed to operate very well. I will be back for more and am excited to try other things on the menu.< /Review>

< review>
My boyfriend and I decided to order take-out as a good friend of ours was raving about this place and especially the pizzas. We drove all the way from West LA to Burbank last weekend since there's not as much traffic lately. I'm a Margherita kind of pizza girl so we ordered a Margherita Pizza and the Roasted Grape & Kale Salad. Both were delicious! The pizza crust was perfect and I could tell they use fresh, quality ingredients. The salad was super tasty and the flavors were well-balanced. I highly recommend this place and what we ordered. I wish we had a place like this nearby. The prices are reasonable and the staff was friendly. Good parking and they have a cute patio area for outdoor seating. I also felt good about supporting a newly opened small business. Definitely check this place out!<//review>

<Text>Some of the best gourmet pizza that I have ever had. Great selections, and can't go wrong with anything you order; my personal favorite was the Siciliano pizza. Their staff was very friendly as well, as they delivered to my front door with a smile. 10/10, would definitely order from here again, and go to dine in as well.<//Text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Extremely disappointed that shop was closed for weeks, after reopening, to get this kind of service. In addition I shouldn’t have to spend 22.00 USD to eat cold pizza.<//Review>< pictures>

<pictures>None< /pictures><Review>We had heard about this place from a friend of ours who lives in Glendale and said it was great.  Figured we would take a drive from WEHO to Burbank to get out of the house after being quarantined.  We ordered a Pepperoni pizza and Caprese salad for pick up and ate it in the car literally outside the restaurant.  The pizza was great with large pieces of pepperoni and the dough was perfect! The mozzarella in the salad tasted like they made it in house and was also great.  We did not go inside due to Covid-19 but the restaurant looked nice with plenty of indoor and outdoor seating. The staff was very friendly and the parking lot  on site made it easy to jump out of the car and get the food.  Definitely recommend this place and will be coming back!</Review></record></dataset><record>

< Review>
During quarantine, I wanted to get out of the house and eat a more refined pizza than the Digiorno’s I have in my freezer. Life Rooted satisfied my craving for a delectable meal, and I am now a recurring customer!

Here are my favorites from what I order:

1. BRUSCHETTA (Appetizer) 💛
10/10, I would recommend this to EVERYONE. My brother ordered this and I took a bite to try and almost finished the entire plate myself! I don’t even like tomatoes, yet I found this to be my favorite appetizer. Fresh, healthy, and packs a flavorful punch. Definitely coming back for more.

2. Meat & Potatoes (Appetizer) 💛
The appetizer is one of the larger portion sizes, so it should be shared amongst a few people, or it can be eaten as a meal for one. These meatballs are very hearty. The potatoes are whipped to perfection and the entire dish comes together with the gravy dressing. The dressing consists of this earthy, mushroom flavor and it is not too heavy so it goes well with the meat and potatoes. I had some gravy leftover and used it to dip with my fries! Delicious, delicious, delicious.

3. Sweet Sopressata (Pizza) 💛
Wow… I have eaten a lot of pizza in my lifetime, and I haven’t tried anything like the Sweet Sopressata before. The sweetness comes from the honey and I never thought of a pizza combination with that ingredient. This dish was very impressive, to say the least.

4. Insalate (Pizza) 💛
This pizza has definitely become a staple for my family. The sweetness from the fig compliments the prosciutto very well. The pizza is topped with arugula and herb ricotta cheese. There are a lot of components to this pizza and it comes with a nice presentation for that Instagram post!<//Review>

Cat Lane the manager of this storage unit went above and beyond in renting a unit to me.  She was extremely thorough in explaining everything to me as well as showing me how to access my unit and how the lock works.  She answered all my questions and concerns thoroughly with patience as well as telling me what type of boxes/covers and moving tools that the Self Storage offers. I have rented storage units from different storage companies in the past and by far Cat Lane helped me through the process calmly and stress free.  Thank you Cat Lane for your kind assistance.<//review>

I rented a storage unit here from December 2018 to January 2021. No issues, no complaints. All the units are alarmed, and I didn't have any security of theft issues. My reason for renting the unit was to store items we'd shipped from our larger home in Singapore, and once we moved to a larger apartment here in the Bay Area, we no longer needed storage space.<//Review>

I am very pleased with the storage rental process at Brokaw. I made a reservation online and instantly received a text confirmation. The day of my rental the paperwork process was seamless and efficient. The on site staff  (Cat) was friendly and professional. The unit and the location was very clean. Thanks for making my storage rental a pleasant experience!< /Review>

Very happy! Cat helped me get set up and informed me of local resources and little tricks ( like giving my family a copy To back up key so I do not lose it, it can in Handy)! Cat is so personable and professional she is the Best!<//review>

< Review>
Love this place -
1. Management - Cat is great she is very knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. She takes pride in her work and the safety and appearance of the facility. She knows almost all of the tenants by know and greets them as she takes her maintenance and inspection walks through the facility.
2. Hours - 6 am to 10 pm is awesome access to my storage. I haven't found any other storage place with these hours with the exception of one 24 hr place
3. Prices- very reasonable and online there are always specials that will help you get into a storage unit that will fit your needs for minimal up front cash out of your pocket.
3. Facility - clean well kept with dollies always available and easy elevator access.
All around best value and storage is brokaw self storage<//Review>

I went with my daughter to check out Brokaw Storage to see if they had what she needed. They did. She had been to several different places and found that she liked this one. The manager Cat was excellent. She helped my daughter figure out what size would suit her needs the best. None of the other places she had gone to were that helpful. She was very friendly & professional. Thank you for taking care of my daughter and for not trying to sell her more than she needed.</review>

Front desk staff is amazing; above and beyond in friendliness and was very accommodating.. the place itself is clean.. only suggestion I would recommend is better lighting at night.. parking lot is supper dark and you have to use a flashlight to see the keypad.</text>

Super friendly and helpful with smiles included. They make it very convenient with the flatbed carts and wide elevators. All that and the best price in town that I could find. Thanks Brokaw self-storage.

<Time>1489065346007< /Time><Rating>5< /Rating><review>Outstanding! Open until 10 (you must be out by 10 because the gates auto-lock) while most places are closed at 7 or so, very clean, well-run, very convenient being between 880 and 101, always have carts to cart your stuff to your unit, very nice locks and they give you 3 keys. and lastly, affordable. I thought the real estate run-up would have run up storage prices, and they've gone up a bit, but they had an unusually-shaped unit that was fine for my needs and at a killer price. I believe they allow some RV storage in back; I didn't see any RVs in back yesterday, but I've seen them in the past. Very professionally-run, none of the "downmarket" vibe some of these places have.</review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

Increased my rent price by adding Insurance without consulting me yet I was told specifically my final price for as long as I rented. It would have been nice to be consulted that I have to pay extra $13 for insurance that we never discussed when I was renting.< /Review>

They were the best price for Ceramic Tinting. We called around and “Cash” was very informative on the process and prices. We were very pleased with the outcome and the difference it made in temperature in our car. We have black leather seats and it was hot 🥵 having the tint is clutch! Thank you Ms. Cash! You guys were great! We’ll be back!</review>

They were running a special and I was able to receive  the window tint at a good price. Friendly,attentive and know how to value  your business. I was treated well by every staff member I encountered. Other than having to leave my car for 7 1/2 hrs the outcome was well worth the wait , excellent work ,treated my car with respect leaving me nothing to complain about, Thanks guys I will definitely be a returning customer in the near future .<//text>

We were greeted outside as soon as we arrived! Cash was so friendly and straight to the point! She explained our options and was patient while we made our decision. I would absolutely use them again for any future tinting needs and I would very highly recommend them to anyone looking to get their windows tinted! Every thing about them is top notch!< /review>

<Text>I’ve look all round Fresno to find a place to tint my new car I just bought but others tinting shops around Fresno prices were kinda high $400+. But Cash was very friendly and quick to help me out and gave me a very good price for the tinting job. Thank you Cash! I would recommend anybody that’s looking to get their vehicle tinted great prices and overall job< /Text>< Pictures>

I dropped the vehicle off at 8am and was ready by 10:55am. The  front desk lady manager Cash was very kind and helpful, Very professional. The work was very nice and they give a warranty with service.  They also offered me a Veteran Discount of 10% which honoring us Veteran means alot to us. Thank you and I encourage all veterans to do business with Veteran friendly businesses.< /Review>

<review>I came into Precision not knowing anything about window tinting and with central valleys humid weather, it's best to get your windows tinted before summer hits! Would highly recommend anyone to go get your windows tinted here at Precision, especially with Cash, she's very helpful and great customer services. Will come back to get my front wind shield done pretty soon!</review>< Date>

I was able to take my vehicle in quickly and they explained the different types of tinting and explained what I needed to do to assure the tint dries completely.

<Text>I rarely post a review but felt it was necessary in this case.
Professionalism from start to finish. I explained I wanted to tint the front windows on my new 4Runner but had a limited time frame to get the job done. The Precision Team quickly scheduled a time that would work, Cash greeted me with a smile as I came in and within the hour I drove off with my windows looking exactly as I had hoped at a price lower than expected!

<Review>For Christmas I got a gift certificate for window tinting and was so excited to see it was for Precision! I had seen their name all around town and heard nothing but positive things, so I anticipated a positive experience and sure enough I was right! I called and got an appointment the SAME DAY! When I arrived, I was greeted by Cash at the front desk and she was extremely friendly and helpful. She explained the whole procedure and walked me around to show me the different tint options. When I got my car back 2 hours later I felt like I had a whole new car! I can’t stop looking at it. No bubbles or wrinkles anywhere. I love the choices we made on the tint and I have already told everyone in my family to go see them!  The customer service, attention to detail and overall experience is 10 out of 10! If you’re looking into window tinting I highly recommend Precision!<//Review><rating>5<//rating><response>{'time': 1610225132033, 'text': 'Sara thank you for taking the time to review our business!!

Decided to wait a little to post this review. Got my windows tinted on a brand new 2021 GMC AT4 on 12/22/2020. Absolutely amazing job no bubbles haze or wrinkles. All I can say is they were phenomenal from start to finish even when I changed my mind on the front two windows tint percentage. Cash was absolutely pleasant to work with and ill be back soon to get the front windshield done. I will say this in closing when you pull up and all the cars in the lot are on the higher end you know you made the right decision.</Review>

Had all of the glass on my Husband's 2020 Ford F-250 tinted darker than a steamy scene from "50 Shades of Grey." We were VERY happy with the overall professionalism and attention to detail of their installers. That front office staff, especially that Cash gal made the entire experience that much better!

I had been looking into tinting my vehicles windows for a couple years now, and I was recommended here by a coworker of mine.

Some parts of the seal aren’t put back in place, some are bent and messed up. Wish I could post pictures. The lady at the front desk isn’t very customer friendly either.

I recently purchased a new car and on my drive home from the dealership Precision Window Tinting was the first place I called to make my appointment. Last summer I had Precision Window Tinting take care of my wife's car at the recommendation of a friend. Excellent customer service and local owners delivering a high quality service. The ceramic window tinting makes a huge difference in the level of heat inside our cars. Besides looking amazing, the heat reduction in our vehicles is the number one reason to visit Precision Window Tinting. I dropped off my new car in the morning and before noon it was ready for pick up. Everything looked clean inside and I could tell that they took care of my car and we're very considerate to leave no trace of the fact they were working inside of it all morning. I highly recommend Precision Window Tinting.< /review>

< Review>
I got my windows tinted on 12/09/2020. As far as the windows themselves, they look good. It’s only been a couple weeks so we will see how it turns out, but so far no problems. However, the one issue I had was with my window panel. Long story short, it was not put back in correctly and I felt like they were trying to shift blame on me saying that for my type of car they do not take the panel off. They even looked at the paper work that they kept on my car and said it couldn’t have been because of taking it off. They suggested maybe I spilt something on it, but I didn’t drive it since I got the windows done. They were nice enough to pop off the panel and they were able to see that when someone put it back on it did not click back in place on one side so that was why my buttons were not working correctly. Although my issue was resolved, I feel like my review reflects my overall experience. I had to go back and forth twice to get it fixed and from the paper work they found it said the panel was never removed but I think it was clear that it was and put back on incorrectly.</Review>

I can keep the curtains open to see out and still have privacy that people cannot see in. With the tinting my pictures and furniture will not get faded. It really keeps the heat out so my energy costs will be lower. The installation was fast and such friendly and hard workers. I highly recommend Precision Window tintingy company to everyone. You'll love the results!<//review>< time>

After an initial issue with this business, my wife was personally contacted by the owner and he went out of his way to resolve the problem . I was impressed with his level of professionalism. His desire to make every customer happy and satisfied was commendable. It's nice to see a business owner who still stands by the idea that each and every customer is important..< /Review>

Quality friendly service. Very family oriented and operated and their staff really knows their stuff. I don't trust my vehicle with many places but their welcoming attitudes and knowledge put my mind at ease. They stood up to their name of precision and i have already recommended to friends and family. Great job guys.</review>

My husband wanted to tint the south facing windows in our house, and I wasn’t sure if it would look good....but now that it’s done, I’m so happy!! Embarrassingly, I had actually resorted to living with blankets over the back of my couch and towels on a sofa table because the sun coming in through the windows was so strong I was worried it was going to ruin my furniture. It looked like there was a homeless encampment in my living room LOL. Now I can take all the crazy blankets and towels off everything and actually have my home looking nice again!

I am EXTREMELY picky, and I was so impressed with them. They carefully moved the furniture that was in the way, then once all work was performed, they even moved it back into place!!<//text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1596642562520, 'text': 'Patricia it was great meeting you today and you have a beautiful house.We do our very best to provide excellent customer service and products!!

<Review>I have had many cars tinted over the years. But there has been no company like Precision from the first contact through email to the day of my appointment customer service and response times were top notch!! And the attention to detail on my tinted windows was excellent! Shanna let me know exactly what was going to be done and we chose the right shade. If you want the very best customer service and top notch work you need to call the people at precision you won’t be disappointed.</Review><pics>None</pics>< user_name>

<Text>The actual tint and window installation turned out good but I had to go back multiple times due to my car door panel being improperly reinstalled. It was a minor inconvenience but if I had work it would have been major to have to go back multiple times.

For my car it cost $250 for the doors and back window with lifetime warranty. Another minor issue was that I wanted a 10% tint but they only offer 5 or 15 as the darkest tints.</Text><UserId.>113562154061033053983< /UserId.><user_name>Michelle Yang< /user_name><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCGGB7-UbNignuqh1U-B2zmO9G6z5aLKSsCsGW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics>< response>

It’s alright. A few bubbles here and there. They also didn’t cover the whole window with tint. They stop at the edge to the top of the window. This was my first time going here rather then going to house of the shades. Overall my quality of the tint looks great.<//review>

This place is the best place to take any vehicle! They make the best recommendations for any vehicle and make sure you are within the law. They work with many police officers and give back to the community. Don't forget they also do doors and windows for the house!</review>

If you are looking for a company that stands by their product and provides excellent customer service, look no further, Precision Window Tinting did an awesome job tinting the windows of our vehicle.  If we could rate more than 5 stars, we would because their company well deserves it.  Jeff was extremely helpful in delivering a product that we can be satisfied with.</Text>

I loved EVERYTHING about my experience with Precision. This family run business is wonderful! Jeff and his wife Shanna were so nice and sweet! Jeff has 35 years experience in the business. I loved his passion for what he does and his knowledge of the business.
I got my husband’s windows tinted as a surprise Christmas gift.Jeff heard me trying to figure out how I was going to pull it off and offered to help me. He and his staff went above and beyond to help me. I was able to pull everything off the surprise without a hitch. I highly recommend this company for a wonderful tint job and amazing service you won’t get anywhere else at a sweet price.</Review>

<Review>A big thank you to Jeff and Shanna of Precision Window Tinting in Clovis. Jeff and his crew did a wonderful job installing film on my family room and bedroom windows.  They also did a great job on the front door glass panel.  What a huge difference in my home!   I’m going to enjoy having the drapes open without the worry of sun damage to my furniture. Also, the color of film Jeff suggested makes my windows look beautiful!  I’m so glad I contacted Precision for an estimate.  They are professional and take pride in their work.<//Review>< Pics>

< Review>
This company knows what customer service is all about. I called there shop to get a price for my new 2020 Nissan Altima and Shanna answered all my questions and helped me with what shade to choose. I was able to get in the next day, when I arrived Shanna greeted me by name which was very impressive. The tint on my car came out beautiful and to top it off they wiped down the whole car because I brought it in dusty. When I picked it up Shanna went over all the directions and walked me to my car!!!If you are looking for 10 star service from start to finish this is definitely the place to come to. I now know why some of the large new car dealerships use A Precision for there tinting. I will definitely be referring family and all my friends.< /Review>

Jeff and his guys are detailed oriented. The time they took to tint my 2019 Elantra Sport and the quality of their work exceeded my expectations. I recommend everybody to visit them for all your commercial and auto tinting requirements!!! 💯+<//Review>

Before my left arm and face would be burning up but not anymore. I’m going to have them do my windshield next. They do quality work and have great pricing. In fact I messaged them though the website on Sunday evening and I got a quote in less then 10 minutes!

<review>These guys go above and beyond for their customers, they KNOW what good business is all about and that seems to be hard to find these days. Their number one priority is the customer and they do whatever it takes to keep them satisfied and coming back. The owner (Jeff) really cares and has been in business for 35 years, from the front office secretary to the workers in the back, everything was very efficient, great communication and perfect finished product, I was thoroughly impressed with everything all the way around and the truck looks amazing after the tint job, I will be coming back for a long time!< /review><Rate>5</Rate><response>{'time': 1567043740403, 'text': 'Thanks Aaron for the 5 star Review it was great meeting you and your correct our customers are number 1 to us along with great products .

Yesterday I took my car in to get the windows tinted and WOW! I was just BLOWN AWAY at what an easy, and amazing experience it was! The owner, Jeff, is an old friend of mine and when I stopped by Precision Window Tinting Co. last week he was just as friendly as I remember, so incredibly informative, and extremely accommodating. I used to get windows tinted because it looked good but now that I have kids especially, Jeff really educated me on all the benefits that come with GOOD tint that I never knew about, and he was available the next day to get it done. My car was in and out, done FLAWLESSLY, and the customer service & expertise provided by everyone there was unbelievable. You just don't get customer service like that anymore. They communicated with me throughout the process to make sure that I was getting the best job for my needs and made sure that I was in full understanding of the after care and warranty during pick up. I referred a friend to take her new Telluride to Precision within ten minutes of driving off their lot. It was HOT when I picked up and my car had been curing in the sun for over an hour. When I got in I couldn't believe the difference. The sun has no chance against this ceramic tint. No reason to waste gas "cooling off" your car before getting in OR scorching yourself on your seats and steering wheel. It's beyond a noticeable difference; it's like 90% cooler than it was prior to tint. I HIGHLY recommend that everyone go see Precision Tint!! Living in this HOT valley you will not regret it!</Text>

<Review>After reading the reviews online, I stopped in today to get an estimate for my car. Not only was I greeted promptly and courteously, Jeff fully explained the tint dynamics and his suggestions for my Audi (that I'm finicky about). They offered to complete the tint today and at a very fair price. I agreed and they even went as far as dropping me off and picking me up from my place once it was done. Tint looks great and the customer service is unparalleled. Well done Jeff & Shanna!<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>{'time': 1554864645569, 'text': 'Thank you for taking the time to review our business!!

Just wanted to thank the staff at Precision window tint for the great tint job they did on my new Lexus. They were very informative and the staff was so nice and friendly. They even gave me a ride home when my other ride canceled. My windows look great and my kids will be nice and cool this coming summer. For all that are looking for the best tint shop in the Fresno/clovis area look no further Precision is the best not only there work but there staff. Definitely a 5 Star business!!</text>

I bought a Christmas tree from this family business and I was very pleased with the way they do business.  They are very professional, family oriented, reasonable and fair.  I was intimidated at first thinking this place was too expensive.  Boy did they prove me wrong!  I hope to do business with them in the future.  Thank you Mr. Jeff!</review>

I can't say enough good things about this company. I brought my new 2018 mustang GT in and have been thrilled to work with the professionals at precision tint. From the first call to completed job, they have been top shelf. They are half the cost and double the quality. If your wondering where to get your tint done, stop looking, give them a call, you won't be sorry. Jeff and Shanna, thank you both so much, the car looks awesome!!< /Text>

They happily took my car in on that Sunday! I was super grateful for that because I wouldn’t of had any time for the next couple of weeks! The job was amazing and quick! The price wasn’t at all bad and very reasonable! Oh AND! I hit a bug on my front window driving over there and I was super disappointed because I JUST washed my car but i realized whenever I got back in my after my windows were tinted that they cleaned it off!< /Review>< Name>

Another competitor had quoted me $200 for the peel and new tint of my rear and back windows. However, when I arrived to my appointment, the same work quoted over the phone was now going to be $340 plus a possibility of a damaged antennae. Disillusioned by the misleading business practice I called up Precision Window Tint for a quote and spoke to Shanna. For the peel of the old film and new tint, I was quoted $225. The amazing part was that I did not have to make an appointment at the time and brought my car right in. When I arrived the price quoted over the phone was honored plus there was no mention of the possibility of a damaged antenna. My car was ready in about two hours (4-5 hours quoted by competitor), and the quality of the work was stellar. I will recommend and go back to Precision Window Tinting not only for the quality of the work, but mostly importantly the way they treat their customers.</Review><Gmap_id>0x80945bdcd45ccd05:0xa46cc91139c1046<//Gmap_id>< Date>

Great company and great staff. My windows look great and now my kids are happy to be in the shade . Not to mention that they even washed my car.  I have been so busy with work and haven’t had any time to wash it and I should have known but to bring it clean.They go above and beyond and I definitely recommend them to others. They definitely represent the spirit of Old Town Clovis<//text>

<review>This company treated me like family. Took my car in to get tinted and not only did they tint my windows but they brought my car to me when it was done. I don't live far from there business so I walked home but they didn't want me walking back so they drove it to me later that day when it was ready. I didn't feel like a customer I felt like family. Everyone should go to them not only will your windows look great but you will meet some wonderful people.<//review>< pics>

The prices are by far cheaper than any other competitive out there, both in Fresno and in Clovis.
The wonderful lady upfront was very friendly, and she helped me pick the right shade for my two front doors to my Honda Sport.  They took me in as a walk-in and had my car ready in less than an hour.  I was so pleased with the quality of work that I decided to return a couple days later, so they could tint my front windshield.  I can’t wait for my front windshield tint to dry, so I can have them place the dark visor shade ontop.  Again, the price was 80% cheaper than the cheapest competitor in Fresno.
I honestly was afraid to have my windows tinted by a company that was so cheap in pricing, but I’m glad I followed through.<//text>< Pics>

Got ceramic window tinting by this amazing team of professionals! Cash made the process easy, presenting options, answering questions and submitting all of the warranty paperwork at the end. Very happy with the result! Highly recommend this team to anyone who wants quality tinting!</Text>

$8.50 for am 11" pizza with as many toppings as you want? That's great! The dough is perfect, for me. It's thin and crispy. Let's me enjoy the toppings more. Most pizza places have doughy crusts that is really just a filler. Service was great, everyone was friendly. The bathrooms were clean as well.</review>

Great place for a quick bite before seeing a movie at Bella Terra in HB. Lots of seating. Plenty of pizza toppings to choose from even for vegetarian or vegan eaters. Casual vibe and super friendly staff.</text>

My first time ordering from MOD Pizza and it is delicious! So convenient to be able to place your order online and pick it up when it's ready. The staff at the Huntington Beach (Bella Tera) location are so nice and provided fast, efficient, and great customer service. This will be my regular pizza spot going forward. Thanks for awesome pizza and rad associates who made it!</Review>

<Text>I like how they have "classic" options for the build your own to use as a starting point, but you can go fully customized if you want. Garlic strips are amazing. Cinnamon strips are okay by themselves, but the strawberry dipping sauce makes them heavenly. The "no-name" cake is essentially a hostess cupcake but more gooey (pretty good actually). Overall highly recommended. EDIT: Holy cow, just saw their sign for 2$ craft beer on draft 16oz all day Tuesdays. Dang.<//Text>< pictures>

Mod Pizza is one of the best assembly-line pizza places, and their gluten free crust is by far the best. Staff is great here, I've had Dillon help me multiple times and he always provides great service with an awesome attitude. He seriously usually adds to the experience of coming here! Location is clean, crowds are usually not too terrible, and there's often some sort of promotion going on!

If you're unsure of which pizza place to go, go here!< /review>

My son has a dairy allergy and the staff was more than accommodating (change of gloves, a fresh pizza cutter, etc). One employee even took the time to ask about his allergy and what it entails. I appreciated the fact that these employees didn’t make me feel like a burden when asking for a dairy free option (even though it does require a little more work to safely prepare food for my son).< /Text><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< GmapID>

<Review>I really like Mod Pizza.  I like the ingredients that they have for their pizzas and salads. Everything always seems so fresh!  Sometimes gets crowded and it takes a long time to get your order in, but so good when you do.< /Review><Rate>4<//Rate><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< date>

<text>Love the idea of being able to be creative with pizza toppings and get ones that pair well. The pizzas are really great and are a good size.  They have great salads to choose from too and with lots of options. Great choice for something quick and delicious.< /text>< Pictures>

<Rating>4</Rating><Review>Mod pizza to me is like a fast food pizza. Staff is amazing and attentive. Pizza is priced right, and toppings are good. However I think the quality of the dough could be better. When comparing pizza places one must always think about the crust. The crust has very little excitement. But all and all a good quick pizza. Btw I had the “Isaac”<//Review>< pics>

Not impressed... service was good, toppings seemed fresh enough.... the dough tho... not impressed... Wanted this to work out since it’s closer to home.... guess I’ll stick to blaze or blast n brew!! Pei Wei.... why, why did you leave us with this soft doughy wanna be “blaze” non crust cooking wanna be??< /Review>

always an amazing experience eating pizzas here, the reason is you can always make them different each time, there are so many toppings so many options so many possible combinations that I could possibly come everyday and not repeat a single type of pizza for months and months.< /text>

Very fresh ingredients!  I love that you can put as many toppings on it that you want for 1 price.  Garlic strips are nice, but very thin.  Hate the hand dryers in the restroom - not very energy-efficient, and experts say they spew germs.</text>

<text>I usually give a 4 plus but... as my pizza builder was making the pizza's as he was leaning over the pizza he was creating he had his mouth open and tongue sticking out. I watched very clisely for any drulling...and would have pitched a fit if that would have happened. Maybe he may need some food handling retrainin?
I do love Mod pizza nevertheless.
Managment please talk to him. Ill be back again as you are closest to my place.

<review>I don't know if there was an isolated technical issue but Apple Pay didn't work for me. Costumer service wise, they need some more training. On the speaker sounds very polite and helpful but once at the window when face to face, it seems like he was not happy to be there. I understand he might it been tired but, if someone chooses a job where you need to deal with people, tiredness is dealt with at home.<//review>< Pics>

I will NEVER GO BACK TO THIS LOCATION. THE PERSON THAT TOOK MY ORDER WAS EXTREMLY RUDE. SHORTED ME 3 MEDIUM FRIES, ( I discovered after I got home) and as I was leaving the drive thru she said get the"f"___ out of here.  I was very polite,  and not sure what her problem was. She should be fired.< /Text>

<Review>Ok they seem seem to have lost their.... Mojo!! This branch opens at 7 am . I placed a pickup order at 7.04 am and they accepted it. But when I get there to pick, they refuse service as there is no one to work inside. Don't know why they allowed me to order in the first place then ?  Waste of a trip, but hey I gained experience and BK lived up to its reputation . Sigh!</Review>< pictures>

Came in to get a breakfast quick during COVID-19: a Croissan'wich, hash browns, and a coffee on a Saturday morning.  They had stickers on the floor to tell you how to move.  Just waited 3 mins for the food and I was off.  The food tasted great, and cheaper than that S* coffee place.

Easy to get in and out, if you know the area.  Use Halford Street in and out when El Camino is busy.  Plenty of parking and a drive through that starts in the back to get you in and out.<//text>

<Review>Terrible location, plain and simple. Wanted fast food got slow service instead. Chicken nuggets took more than 5 mins to get and it was not even busy at all. They didn't even try to make the food, the burger tasted old and the nuggets were so dry and dark that I am guessing the oil wasn't changed. Absolutely irritated from this location, never had fast food this bad.</Review>< pictures>

Their app didn’t work so I went there instead. It was frustrating already because of the app failure but the staff acted like he hates me or something. Didn’t even look at me when I greeted him first. Horrible attitude. The KFC across the street serves their customers way better than this Burger King.< /Text>

<review>Old coffee, do not have decafe. Asked for ranch, been told do not have any they are out off it. Croissant sandwich was inside warm but outside cold. Manager was watching TV most of the time in the dinning area, no customer no one works. What to do the survey but no location number shows on the receipt, they know they are bad so they don’t want any one do the survey.</review></record></dataset><record>

No stars food was good but you can eat comfortable is full of transcendent! Taking over the tables washing up like if they live there! That's is not good for an establishment.
I even saw one of the employees baby sitting their 3 kids while at work Terrible!
I work for alot of people who order Burger King but they saw that and not they are helping the place negatively.</Text>

< Review>
My wife and I arrived here around 2:30 pm for a late lunch and ordered through the drive-thru window. We placed our orders and found a nice shaded area under a tree to park and enjoy our meals. My wife and I both ordered the number to combos which consisted of the Texas Double Whopper medium drink and fries. I ordered onion rings in place of the fries. I also requested the zesty onion ring sauce as well as assorted sauces and ketchup for my meals. After sorting out our food, I looked in our bags and couldn't find any sauces or ketchup. This slightly annoyed me to say the least. My wife said, don't worry about it I'll go back inside and get them. When she came back, we began to start our eating. When I wrapped my Whopper, I noticed that it was a single Patty and and it was missing the extras. My wife checked hers and it was the exact same. At this point, I was very upset. We looked at our receipt, and apparently they took down our order incorrectly. This infuriated me. At this point, I wouldn't side and spoke to the manager and told him what had happened. He explained that we ordered the wrong meals and would happily fix it, but we will be charged for the extra patties. I told him that they incorrectly processed our orders and I wanted them to correct it and no extra charge because this was the second time in less than 10 minutes that they messed up our orders. He agreed, corrected are workers and we went on our way. We finished our meals and went home shortly thereafter. We probably won't be visiting this Burger King again. Not recommended.</Review>

Again they forgot items in my drive through order. Again very agressively rude male employee. Again given hard time ordering with coupons. No restaurant number on receipt for taking online satisfaction survey (I suspect this number is left off on purpose). Will not be returning to this franchise unless given an apology.</text>

< Review>
Came here at 10:50pm after a long drive with my family, when we pulled up we got nothing no respons no "may I take your order", my son got  cranky and we ended up pulling out,as we pulled out someone else pulled up and they got a response from the server,so we went back and he was completely rude ,and lackluster even after we paid he said wait here, just for bus to be flagged down by the same exact guy only he moved to the 2nd window completely unprofessional... Usually I wouldn't care but that was just a ridiculous.< /Review>

<text>This Burger King is one of the lest favored in all of the ones I have been to. The manager who was at the widow was very unkind n very rude to my family n me.... Did not act as if we were worth his time or effort. We were not exactly ready n he seemed very onoid by this. Then I requested a burger n he did not put it on are request. I had ask for chocolate milk with my lil ones meal n he put a cola down when I ask him he said well what did you want... I told him as nice as I could chocolate milk n no Onions on any burgers. He did not repeat the order n then got uppety with me as it was all my fault... He did not have any onions thank goodness but when I ask him about my Niger he said I never said anything about it. I ask my family did I or not because yes I can be forgetful but my brother n kids said yes I had ask for the Rodio King burger but when I said to him yes I would like the Rodio burger I Orderd he charged me less n I thought he was being kind for charging me less... Then he gave me the bag n it was so tiny I was like what is this? It was a cheeseless silver doller sized burger that I was insulted to have.... I ask him what is this n he said its what u ask for! I replied I asked for the Roddo Burger the big one the Rodio King he replied to me you said Rodio burger n thats what you said.... If he had listens the first time n been nicer I would not be writing this today.... Any one who knows me knows I am very easy going n kind but I will never set foot or go back to this BK again... Go to ElCamino n Grant much better n kinder service they listen n read back what you order.... This manager is off his rocket to be in his position.... I would avoid him at all Cost. Just RUDE!!!!!!!< /text>< pictures>

over 3 years of living nearby, i visited at least 100 times. It's sustainable food. I only went inside twice, that was enough for me.
They have recently added Orange Fanta to the beverage Menu, Yay.< /Text>

The servers were courteous, even with a yelling baby they never complained while ordering from the drive thru. They were even so courteous that they offered to bring the food to the parking lot as it would take more time.< /Text>

<Review>So disappointed! I was loving the .99 ice mocha coffee. I knew it would come to an end soon. I drove up to the drive thru to see a woman standing in front of the sign. I vould clearly see the any size coffee ice or hot .99. She was trying to rip it down and took about five minutes to finally get it off. I then proceeded to order. At the window i asked why I couldnt jave the promotion since it was still up when i arrived. The older man said sorry ended yesterday and shut the window. So good bye burger king!<//Review>< Pictures>

the food is great sometimes but the people working here are incompetent as well, make sure you get the manager to do your order as he will always get your order right, anyone else like the kid with the bad acne scars will probably mess up your order like he has multiple times and forgotten a lot of items i've ordered.<//review>

Customer service here is terrible.  Those guys work here including the manager don’t even greet customers at all.  They have very bad bad attitude.<//Review>

<Review>I had a great experience! Very professional, and everything was clean and sanitized. I felt so comfortable getting my helix and rook done. After care instruction and everything was so simply put, and they don’t have any of the junk in their products as well!! Definitely will be coming back!<//Review>< Pics>

He did a fantastic job and it was fairly quick and painless. He got it perfect and the splashes of color were just how I wanted. Great work and great prices<//text>

<Review>Went into Fine Line Design today to see Jeremy Jensen. I already had made an appointment for three of us. My husband, sister, and myself and it was awesome that Jeremy had time for all of us. This is our 3rd time to see Jeremy ,because  he is a great artist and a great Man. Once again Jeremy made sure that he know exactly what we wanted and  he was again very professional ,clean and friendly. We all got our tattoos done in a quickly manner and we All were VERY HAPPY with the amazing work. We will be recaminding Jeremy to those looking for a wonderful tattoo artist.
Thanks again.

<Review>I have had the pleasure of getting tattoos done by all the staff at Fine Line Design. Levi, Shaugn and Jeremy are all very friendly and do amazing work! The atmosphere is always very good too, I really enjoy talking with all of them and watching movies while getting the tattoos done. I will definitely continue to go to them and highly recommend them to everyone! Thanks guys for your good work! 😊</Review><pics>None< /pics><user_name>Heather Welton< /user_name>< response>

Went in for a spontaneous piercing after work yesterday. Got my rook done by Jeremy and he did a great job! Took like five minutes which was awesome. My piercing is in no pain at all and looks perfect. Also the shop is really nice and clean! Will definitely be coming back.</review>

Levi did my septum piercing when I was 14 and did an amazing job, I’m now 18 and still have the piercing. Jesse did my smiley and he did a great job as well. Great environment. My grandma has been going to Levi for tattoos for as long as I can remember. He’s always very generous when we come in and has a positive attitude. 1,000% love this shop and will always recommend!<//Review>

<Text>My sister and I had such a good experience here - especially considering we were walk-ins. Jeremy fit us in within a couple of hours and we are thrilled with the quality of his work. He and the other folks there made us feel welcome and respected. Jeremy listened to us and we walked out of there with exactly what we wanted.  I would not hesitate to go there again.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Over all I was really pleased with the experience. We called in to see they could fit us in. They said they had time, we showed up everyone was really nice. They helped us figure out what we wanted and he even drew it up and it was just what t we wanted. Then when he started tattooing, everything seemed to go wrong. Jeremy started to get stressed out and began complaining about "why he got passed this tattoo, it is the style was the other guys speciality, he was more realistic. He could have left with his wife and family" (they showed up when he was drawing the design). For my first tattoo. I really didn't want to hear how he didn't want to do it, and how he wanted to leave. And how he wasn't confident in doing it.  When he was finished he said "good enough" sorry to say we didn't tip 🤷
Again I am pleased with the outcome. He was a true artist.  I just didnt wanna hear how he didn't even wanna do it. Easily they could have said no when we called to get our matching couple tattoos. I personally don't feel that good customer service and didn't make me feel confident with it being my first tattoo.< /Text>

Awesome atmosphere, very clean and professional. I wouldn't  recommend or go  anywhere else! Fine Line Design is by far the best! Definitely going back for more...you can bring in something or have Levi do a custom piece. .He did my hubby's 1st tat (not to mention plenty of mine) and hubby wants to go back for another!  Thank you. .Thank you. .Thank You!</text>

My best friend and I went in with photos of the tattoos we wanted and Levi did not hesitate to make them exactly how we wanted, and took the time to place them perfectly. He was super nice and we felt very welcome! I'll be coming back asap to get my piercings done! Love love love everyone at a fine line ❤️< /Text>

<review>Levi is a great artist and has done 90% of the tattoo's I have now. He does awesome work and that is why I keep going back. He also as a great attitude, knows how to treat people and is willing to work with you when it comes a design you want to get. My wife also loves his work and loves how you can joke around with him and you still get a great experience plus an awesome tattoo. Cant wait to get back to finish my chest. What I'm really getting excited for is I'm going to let Levi come up with a cool looking Yoda tattoo cause I know he loves star wars. Levi is the first and probably the only person that I will give free rain to design a bad ass tattoo.< /review>< gmap_id>

Just got my first tattoo done ever by levi. He was amazing and did everything I asked of him. My tattoo is wonderful and he even came in on his day off so I could get my tattoo done on my birthday! Very happy and definitely recommend him<//Text>

My adult daughter wanted a tattoo since she was barely a teenager and I tried my hardest to persuade her not to get one. But after years of debate for her twenty third birthday I decided to embrace the idea and but her first one as her gift. I failed to make progress arrangements and we just dropped in to see if he would do her tattoo on her birthday. Which was a scheduled day off.
But Levi told us not to sorry that he's open the shop to fulfill this birthday wish. Well much to my joy he was very professional and clean. His work of art, was without a doubt one of the brightest Dante famine tattoos I've ever seen. And exactly what my daughter head dreamed of. If your thinking about getting a tattoo, I wouldn't trust anyone more than Levi< /text>

<Review>I love the fact that it's very comfortable in in the shop when it comes to conversation an being relaxed when getting work done.. Levi has done a couple of my pieces an fixed one that another shop messed up pretty badly, I wouldn't recommend going anywhere else in crescent city but to Levi....< /Review>< time>

I was going in for a tongue piercing and I told them I was allergenic to metals and they still gave me cheap jewelry that had those types of metals I listed to them and the piercing itself was at a angle and not strange. The female worker was very impatient and didn't listen to my request on how I wanted to be stabbed. I will not go back</text>

I've never had highlights done on my hair & so I sought a salon to trust. I've to say that I'm very pleased with the work that was done by Mai, the salon owner! It's been a few days since my appointment but my hair is still vibrant and soft. The experience was relaxing and Mai asked questions so that I'd have the best outcome. She was friendly, welcoming, and professional, and the salon was clean and kept to the COVID-19 sanitary guidelines. Super happy with the results!< /review>

Lynn did pure magic on my hair!

I've always had trouble getting my hair to be lighter, though it's been something I've always hoped to do. When I told her what I had in mind, she gave me recommendations for what shade/color would look best on me and told me she'd try her best to get me to a nice light color without super damaging my hair. AND SHE DID IT!

I'm SO pleased with the end result. I walked in with my natural black/dark brown fine hair that hadn't been given a proper cut in two years (COVID and then some) and walked out with color I've never been able to achieve before while feeling so silky soft!

The whole process took a while (going from dark brown/black to blonde is NOT easy), but Lynn was amazing and was so attentive the entire time. The color and conditioning treatment she did was incredible.

I'm SUPER happy with the outcome. Will definitely come back!< /Text>

I walked in here with extremely damaged hair with blue underneath brown after dyeing my hair at home and walked in asking for blonde to cover it. Lynn was my hairstylist and she did exactly that. She was very nice and patient, considering she took FOUR HOURS to do my hair properly. I came in for my appointment and was immediately seen. I wish I had a before picture to show how amazing she did. Will definitely be back.< /Text>

I loved the work Lynn did for me. First time I walked in it was for a haircut and she gave me some advise and suggested a conditioning treatment for my dry hair. She left my hair looking and feeling healthy. Second time I went in is asked for a blonde balyage. I am extremely happy with the results. Lynn did and amazing job she took me from dark brown hair to blonde. I highly recommend Plaza Hair Salon< /text>

I got my hair cut (3 inches off and layers) by Fatima, and I couldn’t be happier!! My hair is EXTREMELY thick, but she made it feel so healthy and light! She basically cut three heads worth of hair. The layers are stunning, and I would definitely recommend her to my closest friends. She worked magic! I will 1000% be going back to her.</Text>

I came in with messy multi colored hair and walked out feeling amazing. Luna and Kim both worked on my hair because it was a big task. I showed them my inspiration picture and they took the time to devised a plan and checked it with there team. Then they explained the plan to me and the price. While they worked on my hair they kept on explaining the next step and the plan . They kept on telling me my hair would be better then the inspiration picture which it was .

I got bayalage and a trim. I came in with a serious case of overgrown pandemic hair. Lynn wasn't afraid of all the work! She was very patient and took her time. She explained everything as she did it and made sure I was comfortable. I absolutely love how my hair looks now.
Bayalage takes more time, but I feel my hair is truly unique.<//text>

Great customer service and lovely ambience. The staff is extremely attentive to all their clients with thoughtful recommendations for new hairstyles. James was fantastic with my last haircut and always styles beautifully! If you can spend a little extra for yourself at $80+ then you will definitely get the best bang for your buck.<//Text>

< review>
Curly hair is very hard to keep healthy and my stylist straightened my wet and curly hair so that she could cut it. Was very upset because this was after a deep conditioned treatment. Felt as though it was wasted. My hair is also bleached, which is why I was upset about mistreatment. Was really displeased with this visit. I know more about how to cut curly hair and treat curly hair than my stylist.  I didn’t even get a complete haircut when she decided she was finished and made me pay.</review>

<review>Mai and her staff do AMAZING WORK! My hair started out a medium auburn and in a few hours, they were able to work their magic and make my dream of purple to magenta balyage come true! And yes, I am a grown woman with purple hair.

Five stars is not enough!

I recommend Mai and her team to anyone looking for a color, or a cut!<//review>< pictures>

<Review>I have been going for a few years and everyone is so friendly. I never have to worry about which stylist I get because I’ve never had a bad experience. Recently they fixed my 5 year old’s hair after his regular barber did a horrible job.

Amazing work! Specifically Katrina really knows what she’s doing. If you’re blonde ask for her!! She does the best highlights. Staff always helps each other, team effort to speed up the long time process that highlights usually require. Katrina really cares about hair and wants it to turn out the best. She treats your hair as her own.</Text>

Terrible experience.  Will not return.  I went in for a senior haircut with a coupon from their website.  An older woman greeted me and told me that they had never had haircuts for adults listed at $15.  I told her I had seen the coupon on their website just that morning.  She wasn't willing to consider the coupon on their website.  So, she basically turned away a perfectly good customer because she wasn't willing to check their website for the internet coupons.  You be the judge.<//text>

I have struggled enough to find an awesome hair dresser and a good salon in san diego, But I am confident to say that my search ends with this salon. Christine gave me a fabulous hair cut. She is very professional and highly skilled. I love my new hair cut.<//text>

<Review>I saw Christine today for a hair color and trim. I was describing what I wanted for my hair color and Christine grabbed a color book for me to show her what I was after. When I said the choices were overwhelming she narrowed it down for me based on my skin tone and she suggested the one she thought would look the best. She was right! Hair coloring is very tricky and I think Christine has a knack for helping moms who maybe don't give a lot of thought to their hair be able to be bold and make a change. This was my first time at Plaza Hair Salon and I enjoyed the modern and chic establishment very much!</Review>< rating>

<time>1445203068620</time><rating>4< /rating><text>I just got my hair cut at Plaza Hair Salon for the first time. From the moment I walked in the staff was welcoming. So nice, and I appreciated their sense of humor. Christine was my hair dresser. I told her what I wanted and she worked her magic. I appreciated that she stopped before cutting too short to make sure I was okay with the length. She also did a great job feathering and thinning out my "very" thick hair. When it came to styling she provided a big tip for working with my bangs. I'll definitely be back some color. It's a bonus that they're located right next to a Starbucks and the Barrel Room.</text>< Pictures>

Very friendly staff and very courteous.

Make sure you check for the coupons from their website.

All stylist were females, very experienced and good skills. Mai seems to be famous and everyone wants her to do the hair coloring.

No TV???!!!!!
Hello Plaza Hair, boys need TV. Please put out some for watching sports.

Plaza Hair Salon is fabulous! Mai has cut, colored and highlighted my hair beautifully. She really focuses on customer service. All of the staff is very professional. I have seen many happy customers leave with great hair and a smile. You can't go wrong with any of the stylists. The shop is clean, well organized and relaxing. The prices are quite reasonable. Give this place a try. You won't be disappointed.< /text>

I love this place!
My hairdresser Mai really cares and spends time making you happy. She listened and paid attention to what I wanted and offered suggestions on what best haircut and color that fits me. It's nice coming to her because I trust her and she always gives me options instead of charging me the max for mediocre services. Hair salon is adorable and  affordable, everyone very friendly, hardworking and helpful.
Thank you, Mai!</review>

<review>A satisfied customer since 2007. Mai is an experienced stylist and I have been visiting her for the last 9+ years and never been disappointed. The best thing about her is she understands customer's requirement very well and executes with perfection. She is a very friendly person and loves chit-chatting while doing her job. 😊 I love that about her.< /review></record>

<Review>If I could give less than a (1) I would; I would give this place a -10. When I made my appointment they couldn't even pronounce my name right and still could not pronounce my name right once I was at my appointment. First off I got there at 3 pm exactly at my appointment time and she says "I am glad you were not late?" Then she seemed like she was in a hurry to get my hair done.  I needed my hair color touched up. When I have had my hair done in the past I always had my hair done with two colors with foil. I believe it is called a hair weave. I told her the same color that I have and I did not want blond. Well I ended up with blond highlights and a root touch-up. Totally not the same color as I came in with or had before. I had no blond when I came in to have my hair done. I could not understand why she did one color with foil and then touched up my roots with another color. I have never had my hair done this way. When she was washing my hair she says "let me let you look, I think it is too blond". Yes it was blond!! She said let me touch it up. I don’t understand if you didn’t know what I wanted then talk to me. Don’t just do my hair because you are in a hurry? Then at the end I was charged $85 for the blond highlights, $50 for the root touch-up, $25 for the haircut, and $15 for conditioner (and my hair was fried from all the hair coloring) I have always had excellently conditioned hair. My haircut was less than a pencil tip and she said she didn't need to trim my bangs? Total $170.00 she took $10 off. I am in my mid 50's I have had my hair done for many years I have never experienced this service ever before. I would not recommend this place at all. All of my hair colors/weave has always included the haircut and style<//Review>< Rate>

Not only is Plaza Hair Salon a warm & inviting place but it is staffed by Mai & her amazing team of dedicated & talented people.
Mai is always eager to make her client happy & I can vouch that I always felt good after my hair color & cut.
My husband has been a client for more than 8 years & is never short of compliments about how stylish he looks.
We both highly recommend this Salon.< /Text>

When it comes down to my hair I am super skeptical about who touches it! I have been to other salons when they have left my hair so bad I had come out crying, BUT let me tell you that in this salon I had the greatest experience so far! All the ladies who where there where super nice and attentive to what I wanted to get. I ended up getting a haircut and highlights which they totally did an excellent job in! They will not screw your hair up I promise! My whole experience here was a success and I highly recommend it to everyone out there!</review>

I've been going to Plaza Hair Salon close to 10 years now.  Mai and her entire staff make you feel like part of the family.  It means much more than getting your haircut.  It is the wonderful sense of community and professionalism that Mai and her staff project to their clients.  It is the perfect place to go and relax.  I go every 4-5 weeks and look forward to going every time.  I call it my "spa time" with my haircut, shampoo and head and neck massage.  Several members of my family are now going to Plaza Hair Salon.  I highly recommend Plaza Hair Salon!  Don't hesitate, book your appointment!<//Review>

<review>This place is superb! From the second I step into the salon, I get a very warm welcome as if the the staff knew me for years. The salon is very clean and organized with a good waiting area unlike most others I've been to and the place doesn't reek of typical hair salon places because they do a great job of containing it and airing the place out. Location is also excellent and convenient since it is right next to a Starbucks, Vons, and other plaza goods. I'm a guy so I'm not sure but I believe Plaza Hair Salon also provides pedicures, manicures, facials, and waxing.

As for haircuts, I've had the same haircut for about five years and I was stubborn about changing it until one of the hair specialist, Mai, suggested a particular style for me. I decided to go for it and to my amazement, I love it! I got plenty of compliments and I have never felt more confident with my appearance! I owe it all to Mai and Plaza Hair Salon. I'm definitely returning as a loyal customer.</review>< GmapID>

< Review>
I WAS a returning customer..

The ladies I've had cut my hair before have done well..
I had never left unsatisfied until today.

(But no manager was on duty today.. I guess all business practices go out the door when the boss is away).

After being seated to prepare for my haircut my stylist had to answer the phone. I heard her talking to the customer saying it's slower now and she could take "her" she went down to record the name and asked her when she would be in and she said okay I'll see you in 10 minutes stylist came back and remove me from her chair to tell me she had an appointment coming...
I said excuse me?
She said someone else will cut your hair..

I got up and walked out the door..

How do you remove someone to wait for someone not there that just an appointment on the phone?

I assume the person on the phone was gonna be a larger charge than just your normal haircut i was getting..

Completely unprofessional..</Review>

I am an Interior Designer in Rancho Santa Fe, so I feel like I have to have a good cut that looks good all of the time.   I love this salon!!  I have been all over the county and paid huge amounts to get a good haircut and color and no one has ever done as good a job as Mai. The prices are great and it is a welcoming and friendly environment!</text>

This place lives up to the reviews of others Annie and Wendy made me feel like family. First on calling for a reservation they told me to come right in. Even though they were busy rhey both took their time pampering me. The results showed fabulous color and great cut.  I left the salon smiling. Thanks<//Review>

They are always accommodating with their schedules and do everything they can to fit you in.  When my son got married she came to my home and did makeup and hair for myself and the bride. When my father was ill and could no longer come to the shop, she came to his home and cut his hair and would not let me pay her. She and Annie take care of my mom's hair and nails as well as many other senior citizens.  They are patient and treat everyone with great respect.  They care for three generations of our family.....my grandson received his first haircut there!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1<//rating><Text>First of all, Christine was 15 minutes late for our appointment.  (I was her first in the morning.)  She said she forgot she was working that day.  I told her I just needed a trim and didn't want to end up looking like a man.  Well, she kept cutting and cutting and I did end up with the shortest haircut I've ever had!  Then she tried to sell me on color and a perm.  No way! Very disappointed and will never return.</Text>< pictures>

Horrible. the first few times I went there they were so nice and I loved it but this time I got a new lady. I came in with orange hair (from a bad dye job) and she claimed she could fix it and I'm still a ginger. she also completely ripped out my hair while brushing it and My hair has thinned out a lot from it. this lady wasn't gentle and ripped out a lot of my hair and pulled my hair a lot too. watch out for which lady you get. I recommend Simone she is wonderful. lastly, the prices advertised on alone and not correct, you will be paying more.</review>

{'time': 1463544473003, 'text': "Hi Kendall,\n\nThis is Mai,  the owner  I'm deeply sorry to hear about your experience at our salon.  We at Plaza Hair Salon always try to do our best to make sure our customers are satisfied with our service and top quality products.  We take this very seriously and  would like to invite you back to the salon. Simone or myself will fix your hair, free of charge.  I'm sorry for the confusion with the pricing, on our website partial highlight is  $55 and up, we charge $10 extra for longer hair. Then if there are additional services like toning we need to charge more.  Thank you for voicing your  concern.\n\nThank you again\n\nMai and Plaza Hair Salon Staff"}< /response>

Every week I'd sit and watch all the haircuts taking place during my nail appointment.  One day I fell in love with a cut and color Mai did on a client. I asked Mai about it and she said she'd try it on me, no pressure if I did not like it. Well, I was quite pleased and made the difficult decision to leave my current hairdresser of several years. Mai has worked with me and given me the cut and color I've been waiting for. I love it and I have never been able to go this long between colors. That is a money saver as well as their very affordable prices. Mai has always greeted me with a smile and a hug asking about me and what I want. She has a kind heart and listens. I never feel pressured to try anything out of my comfort zone. The salon is clean and the staff is welcoming.  I highly recommend Plaza Haircutters for an experience that is well worth your time! Thank you Mai and Annie!<//Review><Time>1425997515428</Time><user_id>103835166970207941556< /user_id><Name>Nancy Moiseve<//Name><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>I've been a regular at Plaza Hair Salon for 5 and a half years. Before then my haircuts were always hit and miss and more expensive. Then I found this hidden gem in Rancho Bernardo near the new Starbucks. Now I don't have to worry about getting the cut that missed the mark. Every visit has left me looking and feeling like a million bucks. The staff is friendly and the salon has a clean, contemporary look. I recommend this high end experience at a great price.<//text><name>Sean Garrett<//name><Rating>5</Rating><resp>None< /resp>< Gmap_id>

I have been getting my hair cut and colored here for over a year since I moved to San Diego. This is a gem! Affordable prices and high quality service. I was really reluctant to get an ombré since a lot of places can mess your hair up. My ombré turned out beautifully and my locks remained smooth. I highly recommend Plaza Hair Salon! Mai is great.< /text>

< Review>
First time at this B&J location. We arrived as soon as store opened.  Staff was friendly, but I quickly noticed no gloves were used when scooping out the ice cream of our choice?odd.

Also, cashier overcharged me. Could have been an honest mistake. I just found it peculiar when the machine tells you the exact change amount to give...

Flavors were great.<//Review>

<Review>Terrible, I asked for a single scoop on a cone but it was so small i decided to make it a double and in a cup instead but was still such a small amount of ice cream for 8$ i couldnt believe it. I could have bought a half gallon of ice cream just as good for much less than the 2 tiny scoops i got here. Very disappointed in this ripoff location.< /Review><UserId.>117068201936317099598<//UserId.><Time>1566705700387</Time>< Rate>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Date>1559110647071</Date><text>First time in this store. I had seen a couple of non-dairy flavors at my local grocery store but did not want to spend $5 plus not knowing if it was any good. I was on that side of town tonight and saw a large sign on their door saying "now serving non dairy flavors" and I was excited to taste some flavors, not expecting them to have a ton of options but maybe a couple. The display of scoop ice cream listed one non-dairy ice cream. Please note I am not including the sorbet flavors. When I asked about it the employee informed me that they did not actually have that flavor. I asked if they had any non dairy flavors in the pre packed section and she said they did. When I went to the freezer I couldn't find any non dairy options. Not even the sorbet flavors. I am very disappointed that they advertise having non dairy flavors but did not actually have any. She was apologetic and offered me sorbet but that is not what I was looking for. I went to walmart and found 4 non dairy flavors in the pint for way less cost, but I am still upset that I didn't have a chance to sample or have it served in a cone.</text></record>

Came here together with some friends recently and indulged in some of the best ice cream we've ever eaten. The service was great & so are the prices. I would advise to stopped by in this place and get some ice cream, you won't regret it & I'm sure you'll definitely enjoyed it.</text>

<text>Ended up taking my mother here due to the Cold Stone creamery nearby being closed. I was disappointed with the overall experience

I experienced multiple problems when attending this Ben & Jerry's location.

Gloves were not used when scooping the ice cream.

The ice cream that i ordered (wake & no bake cookie dough core) was freezer burned.

The lighting in the room is terrible.

While not rude, the staff member clearly didn't want to be there that day.

The location has no restroom (I don't care how small a food location is, not having a restroom usable by customers is a Red Flag.)

The acoustics inside the building were terrible, it was hard to hear each-other so my mother and i ended up sitting outside.

I really can't recommend this place in its current state. If you really want Ben & jerry's buy a pint from a nearby grocery story.</text>< Pictures>

This was my first time coming to this ice cream store- and I right away noticed the guy was not wearing any gloves.  As he scooped up my ice cream he held it from falling off the spoon with his finger. He also did not look or dress like he worked there in any way. I will never come there again! I have heard great things about this place but I can honestly say ..it's not.< /Review>

Employee (possible owner) not wearing gloves or mask. While packing our purchase, he coughed without covering his mouth. Very irresponsible.<//review>

<Response>None</Response><text>Very good ice cream that is very overpriced. You can get literally three times as much in a prepacked thing from Target for the same price. And it's the same quality because it's not like the stuff is being churned fresh in this store; the guy - the only guy I think who works there - just opens up a big box of it and serves it to you. Also, the selection rarely changes.< /text>< pictures>

Only gave it one star because I had to in order to review this jerk.  I brought my son in to pick out his very first EVER ice cream cake for his 7th Birthday and with all of the flavor choices of course we planned on tasting.  The jerk behind the counter who claimed to be the owner said we couldn't have anymore tastes after 6. Then he proceeded to tell me how my child should only get two options to choose from and that children shouldn't be able to just choose whatever they want, the parents should make the choice for them. Wow!  Didn't know I was going to Parenting classes at Ben and Jerrys from a cheapskate who should keep his mouth shut and do his job.  It's easy. .. let the poor kid taste as much as he wants until he figures out what all your crazy named flavors mean and sell me a cake for way too much money while my child leaves with a smile.  Never coming back.  Headed straight to Baskin Robbins and we were in and out in 10 minutes! Wonderful accommodating people there and very friendly. Plus it was half the price!</text>

First time here, just moved here from Washington, D.C.  The pedicure was amazing.  Thought I was in Beverly Hills instead instead of the Bay Area.

I'll be back!!!<//text>

Very careful and salon was set up outdoor with distance and shields. I had my nails done and she was very meticulous and steady. The owner is fabulous and made sure everyone was feeling safe!</Text>

Came in for the first time to get my nails done for my birthday on 7/6/19.  My nail tech was Ruby, who didn’t talk much but did what I thought was a good job on my nails. I showed her a picture of how I wanted them at the beginning and she captured the look! They were pretty pricey, I must say. We came in at 5:30, they closed at 6 and were still able to take us and we were seated right away.

On Thursday my index finger nails started to lift and by Sunday they were off. I was upset because I work in an office and only type, so for the nails to come completely off in less than a week is awful! I tried calling the salon and when I finally got through, I explained my situation to Billy (who has excellent customer service!) he told me to come in and he’d have it taken care of. I came in, was seated with Nikki within 5 minutes of my arrival time and was done within 7.  I was handed a ticket to pay and when I got back to Billy, he took care of it for me.

Overall I would go back, (Pros)
- they do styles well and have an abundance of supplies to do many different styles/designs.
- they are quick
- Billy is great
- I received a lot of compliments on my nails
- when I got the replacement nails, the nail tech knew what she needed and exactly how to do them without asking!

Cons
- my nails broke in less than a week
- it was $70 for just the full set. (That’s a little high, especially if you have to get your nails done weekly because they lift)
- they never told me the price up front (which I think should always be told because each place charges differently)
- a third nail just lifted and Nikki’s nails aren’t quite matching the other ones, now that it’s had time to settle.

But I will definitely give them another shot. It’s rare you find good customer service at these kinds of establishments.

For those who won’t try them again:
Pink and White Nails in union city are great!
Lavender is second, and Nu Nails (Southland Mall area near Chase) is really great.
All less expensive and do really good jobs.

Update: since I posted this review on Monday 7/15/19, I lost another nail and 3 have lifted! Would not recommend this salon unless you just want your nails on for a couple days.<//Text>

<Text>Not reliable! Every time I go they change the prices on me. They charge extra for every little thing and don’t even care I’ve been coming for years. This past visit they tried to change the price again and they were rude when I asked about why, so I WILL not be returning and you shouldn’t come either.

Save your money!<//Text>< pics>

I have been going here for a few years now.  They do a great job.  The hair cuts and color always turn out perfect.  Everyone in the salon is very nice.  It is very relaxing too.<//review>

I always am very happy with my nails! If you don't like something they do, it's okay to let them know, and they are understanding about it, and will change it for you. Having a picture of you want is a plus. They do a really good job and have so many stations, but the wait can be a bit so make an appointment! Sometimes you have to wait a bit for your appointment, but I believe it depends when you made it. I usually make mine more than a week in advance so they don't need to squeeze me in!< /Review>

<review>I got my nail gel nails last week and the lady who did it. Didn’t listen properly and she was was doing how she wanted to do and within 4 days my gels nails have come  out and my nails look like some small kid has made no neatness in the gel polish. Now I have to pay again and get new gel nails. I don’t even wanna give them 1 star. I am so disappointed. We are paying for the service and still not getting good services.< /review><pics>None</pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Last Week I went in on Monday and by Wednesday I had already broken 3 nails so easily. I have never broken a nail before but whenever I get them done here they break so fast especially for the price it’s not worth it. Very rude and not gentle at all while doing your nails. Personally I do not recommend this place.</Review>

I've been there 3 times for a pedicure and was not happy with their service, especially for the price!
They get so upset when you don't upgrade and why would I if they don't do a good job for the base package, $27.
The massage was no massage at all, the stones were hardly hot and the water was boiling. I had to ask her to cool it down. I was cut and bleeding when she cleaned up my cuticles and left with nail polish on my skin and toenail was not fully colored.
I was quickly thrown out of the chair! She put my sandals on right after, messed one up and aggressively pulled my leggings down

<review>I came here 3 times before my final visit. Each visit was worse than the last, not sure why I kept coming. They butchered my nails, they were all different lengths and shapes... The gels wouldn't last... On the last visit, the technician pulled a dirty pair of nippers out and used them on my ring finger...I was horrified, there was chunks of other people's skin in the nippers!! She realized her mistake when I protested and pulled a fresh pair out and continued. This resulted in me getting nail fungus on my ring finger one month before my wedding. I had to work miracles to hide that hideous disaster on my wedding day, I was livid about this. BASIC HYGIENE, don't use dirty tools!!! Disgusting!!<//review>< Date>

First time here at Yvonne’s and it was the best nail salon I’ve been to. Not to mention the complimentary mimosa which topped it off for me and the work holly does is beyond amazing. Wish I didn’t waste my time at all the other nail shops before Yvonne’s.<//text>

<Review>Always a good experience. So nice when the girl doing your nails interacts and makes great design suggestions. My Bestie and I only come here, even though Fremont has many choices.

Normally when getting acrylics removed, they would soak your nails in acetone, but apparently she didn’t want to do that because it would make my hands dry. I would have taken that over her trying to pry my acrylics off with nail clippers. This resulted in her splitting my nail down the middle, and I started bleeding. She didn’t care at all. I had repeatedly tried to tell her that I wanted my nails soaked in acetone because I was in pain, she only listened once I pulled my hands away from her.
If I could give zero stars, I would.<//text>< resp>

I have been getting nails done for about 40 years.Been going here on and off for years I had 3 nails break in 2 1/2 weeks  never happened before. Called to ask what they would do for me, thought they would at least offer something to compensate,they were so rude and blamed me unbelievable I of course did nothing different. 3 nails broken and no respect for the customer. So think twice before going here they dont care about us at all.< /review>

<Review>My second time here at this "nail spa"after reading the reviews i am disappointed. There are supposed complimentary mimosas l. None of which were offered. My nail tips were applied poorly even after she removed one to try again. I asked her to shorten them twice and yet still came out too long. Then after all if that the nail technician awkwardly positions my hand for a reveal shot and tells me to move my face out of the way.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics><rate>2< /rate>< resp>

Worst service ever!!! Dirty and did not follow hygienic rules, drop something in the dirty floor and didn't cleaned up before using in my nails, racist and bad mods making fun of me in her idiom, they were trying to pull off my acrylic nail and hurt my finger , I complain about it and she told me that I'm not cooperating with her??? And at the end the worst nails ever!!!! Nothing to do with what I ask her to do!Wasted money !Don't go!<//Review>

<text>Got my mani and pedi done by two different girls. (My usual lady wasn’t available) I left a $10 tip which I think is good ($5 each)  but she forces me to pay another $10 for the other manicurist so a $20 tip. I personally feel it was taking advantage of my niceness. i also noticed the remarks on the designer bag I had before she insisted on a bigger tip. when I’d ask my regular lady if a tip is okay she says she’s happy and says it’s up to me if I want to give tip or not. Never forced me to tip more especially for such crappy work. There’s scuffs on my gel nail polish and she scrubbed my feet so hard skin peeled off. Not worth it at all.< /text><gmapID>0x808fbf5db45e50ab:0x86b2f299b8b2a18f< /gmapID><userid>102112770923354227758<//userid>< Rate>

<text>Sadly, today was peobably the last tome I will visit Yvonne’s. I showed up at 4:30, my mom at 4:45, which is roughly when we got taken to the pedi chairs.

Pedicures went well, and our colors were picked. My nail artist did a decent job and my only complaint was that I had to tell her twice to cut my pinky toes.
However, she randomly gets up and another nail artist said I needed to move to get my nails done somewhat abruptly. My Pedi took 30-45 minutes like usual. However, I didnt leave until 7:15pm... 3.5 hours later because my gel manicure took over 2 hours and I a new artis who didn’t seem to know how to complete a gel mani. Both my pinky fingers were bleeding, my gel mani had bubbles, the paint was all over, and when I told the manager she just said I’m sorry but you still have to pay for at least half of the gel mani. My nails looked horrible. She was like if you give me ten more minutes another manicurist can fix it. The gel was all over so therefore it wouldn’t last and I had no choice. Another nail artist filed off my nails, re-did the gel but there was still paint all over my fingers. She barely fixed the gel that was over the skin line so they probably will last 1.5 weeks tops rather than 3. The whole time my nails were being done different nail artists kept coming by to “see the show” that was my nails. My college graduation is this week, and I just wanted a relaxing time to feel pampered and enjoy a manicure. Wasn’t the case and sadly, won’t go back due to the lack of concern from the artists, manager, and care of Yvonne’s nails.< /text>< Rating>

<time>1517425764474< /time><Review>I normally go to Tiffany's Beauty Lounge in San Leandro, I only went here because a friend recommended it and I couldn't get in at Tiffany's. This place is OFF THE CHAIN. Kudos to them for always being busy and booked, but holy cow. I has an appointment on a Saturday for 12:30pm and they did not take me until 1pm. While waiting for my appointment, there were kids running around and so many people waiting, they had to stand outside. Finally got my nails done, Gel polish with a fill, the polish started lifting and had bubbles in it with in hours of me leaving the shop, so I had to go back to get them redone. I personally like a quite place when getting my nails done, not kids running around and it being extremely loud and busy and to be taken when my appointment time is, not 30 mins later. I have two friends who used to get their nails done here because Trisha did a good job with their nails, but because its always a zoo in there, they now go to another place.</Review>< username>

I hate to bash on nail salons but I got my nails done 2 days ago and I can barely push the tip of my acrylic nails and all popped right off. Which is not the first time. Never can find or get a quality acrylic nail set that is inexpensive.</review>

Yesterday I got a full & the lady that did my nails was ridiculous  She didn’t know where half of her products were to do nails she was like running place to place . She did my nails so half fast & so harsh my fingers are sore . My nails are so thick it looks like a 13year old did them  .also the size of all My nails are so uneven & half of My Nails are shaped half square & coffin It doesn’t even look like my nails fit together . She got glue off over my hands and I had to pull it all off even I got home & half of my nails were literally on my skin on top of my
Cuticles They just look  absolutely  Sloppy . And I had to pay 48$ + extra 10 for her to redo two of my nails that aren’t even the right shape & once I got home I had diamonds on my
Nails they  fell right off . Will not be coming back , waste my money . For crappy nails I could of let a 13 year old just do . Don’t recommend<//Text>

We had a Marvin fiberglass patio door installed by a vendor several years ago who is no longer in business. Marvin put us in contact with Veracity Window and Door and, happily, with Martha Calderon.

Even though Veracity wasn't the original vendor, they ordered the part, kept in touch with us during the process, and sent a well trained (and nice) technician to our home. 40 minutes later the door had new parts, rails were squeaky clean, and is sliding as new.

We appreciate Veracity doing this for us, and it speaks volumes for both Marvin and Veracity. When we are ready to upgrade our our north-facing windows we will definitely give Veracity a call.<//text>

I shopped for months and had several vendors come to the house . We were impressed with the attitude of the home evaluator and the quality of the samples shown. Once Marvin windows were selected the installation team came to the house . I am very picky and didn’t have to say anything because the attention to detail was obvious . I had an issue with a sliding door and the installer returned and simply had it replaced to reach a perfect fit . Weeks later my dog chewed the window handle and destroyed the screen . Again a simple call to the installer and at no cost the handle and the screen were replaced . The crew has been consistently courteous and professional . I recommend their services n love the Marvin quality .</text>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>When it comes to replacing windows and doors these guys really know their stuff. There is a wide variety of sliding windows,double hung windows, casement windows, awning windows, picture windows, and even bay windows. The patio glass doors, sliding glass doors and French doors are top notch in modern contemporary styles and also traditional grid and pane styles. The owner of the Company Jose Calderon has over 25 years of experience in the industry and really knows everything it takes to do a professional window or door installation the right way. He is also a master painter so all the trim work inside and outside of the home turns out top notch. The product they use is made by Infinity from Marvin who’s parent company is Marvin Windows and Doors one of the top three window brands recognized by Consumer Reports along with Pella Windows and Andersen Windows. I think Infinity from Marvin is superior to the other companies like Renewal by Andersen based on the fact that it’s much stronger Window because it’s made of a proprietary Fiberglass product and method that beats anything in the market out there. The finish and colors won’t fade and holds its shape in hot and cold temperatures where as vinyl tend to warp and distort in higher temperatures and can eventually fail over time. I’ve been in the window industry over 30 years and I don’t want to come across as biased however I’ve never come across a product as well thought out as this one. Don’t get me wrong Renewal by Anderson has a great name and I’ve used their product as well however they can’t compete when it comes to strength they don’t have a complete product line where there doors are also made out of Fibrex like their windows are. To me this is a mismatch and incomplete product line. Infinity from Marvin can also make windows and doors in dark colors that don’t fade over time  like the other manufactures. A lot of companies like to say they have the best product and the best installation however with Veracity Window and Door they really do for real.< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk-mreC8D1Qlv6xpBXgMZvf76-jXMMpIswzN4B=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOlKaPF740wYgxyBqLP6g0YJ5h2xitW5CJfp2Ex=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO2oKZC2NcfpB5S7tgIrXJIA5O1agAATJUYoo8U=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNk7sPeZgnIewgwP0rYTERm5QfTnXFGIK76TMnr=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7w1SKAd2XPEQnQ-VLHgFMoeMEEyNpnJ6kHS6F=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPeHGJhOzncxG345ODihHGcJUjGK5_r-nnaswk5=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPvWlcnKJKD_XqXuJoSk7IFmLetWs_O4E5f1oc1=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOukBaXOCEt20cFNL1wJ-VgRw4JlXY9QDcSHDnW=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN6jDVCEt1vCJlu8LIpTeGmvBJnNgl71bEgmroq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPTrN6llXci4F1xaEhn9CW99cjrXmMP6MJEnSO2=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics>< Resp>

Veracity Window and Door replaced four wooden windows on the front of our house with Infinity windows.

They did a quality and very clean installation inside and out.  The windows look great.  They appear to instantly add value to the front of our home (my husband's exact words).

Also, we had previously installed Infinity windows in the rest of our  house about eight years ago, and we are still very happy with them.</Text>

Great company to work with. Coordinated construction team on the first day who worked tirelessly until Phase 1 was done. The contracted local electrician was not the best to work with however the Team Leader Jose took responsibility well. A few mishaps because of the electrician caused the project to take a few days longer than anticipated but quality work and we love our door way! Would definitely recommend!</Text>

<Text>I truly enjoyed working with the Marvin window representative - Michael Johnson.  He was very thorough, direct and helpful. I appreciate that he took time to listen to my interests, needs and concerns, around my project.  All recommendations addressed my interests and there was no pressure to up-sell or add on unnecessary upgrades.  Michael was also very helpful and professional with finance options that enabled me to say “yes” to ordering this superior product.  Thank you for the pleasant purchase experience.  I would highly recommend the product and appreciate the customer-centric sales experience. LB - Vista, California.< /Text>< gmap_id>

We will be keeping Jim in mind when we make a decision about window replacement.  This man knows the business and it was a pleasure to meet with Jim.  Sometimes it is the salesperson even  more than the product that makes the sale. We definitely place Jim in this category, for sure!  The product is impressive too!</text>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Our home in Upland was built in 2011. The builder used builder's grade, double pane windows. We live near a busy road so traffic has been a problem because our windows are very large and let a lot of sound in.

We decided to replace all of our upstairs windows with Infinity by Marvin after seeing them at a Home Show in Ontario. These new windows are very well made. They slide open and closed very easily; much easier than our other windows. I clean my windows monthly and was very happy to see how easy they tilt inwards.

The new windows helped reduce the sound coming into our bedrooms at night. They didn't reduce the sound entirely, but definitely helped. The installers also helped by insulating the area around the windows, sealing them tight. The installers did a good job with their finishing work.

One of the signs of a good company is owner interaction. After the job was done, the owner followed up to ensure we were happy with our purchase and the job done by his installers.

We are pleased with our purchase.< /Review>

Last year I had my entire house windows replaced-16 in total . It took me over 18 months of research and many free estimates. Tony from "Infinity from Marvin Windows" was very informative. I told him I had quotes from $15000 (Home Depot vinyl windows ) to over $41,000 ( Renewal by Andersen). Tony came with a perfect solution for my budget- for under $15,000 I replaced all windows with Andersen 100 series. I was very pleased with the work and the windows. I highly recommend them.< /text>

<review>I love my windows! My whole house now has a complete set. They are beautiful! The installation was quick and easy, everyone was a pleasure to work with from start to finish.
I would however recommend ordering all your windows for a particular room(or entire house) at once because the color match is not exact if you place partial orders and try and complete the remaining windows at a later date. Regardless I am completely satisfied with my windows and their installation.</review><gmapID>0x80dcc9e2e479da81:0x7a07a0a393656f8a<//gmapID>< pictures>

<text>I recently had all the doors replaced on my luxury home. After an entire year of researching companies, we reached the conclusion to have custom made iron doors will be the best option for us. Jose came to install our doors and he was extremely dedicated and professional. I am completely satisfied with the results and the company. Every in the neighborhood complemented the quality and look of the doors. I would recommend Lifetime Window and Door to everyone.<//text>< UserId.>

I contacted several companies when I decided to have windows installed on my property.  The representative from Infinity to the installation crew were extremely professional and responsive.  The windows made a tremendous difference in the look of the property as well as reduced the utilities for heat/air.  I highly recommend Infinity by Marvin if you are planning to have new windows installed.  I couldn't be more pleased with the results.</text>

<Text>Thank you Infinity by Marvin. Since replacing our windows and doors the house remains cooler in the summer and keeps the heat in during the winter months. My family and I no longer have to bundle up in throws during the winter and wear as little as we can in the summer. The house stays at a constant temperature now without the heater running nor the air conditioner running constantly to maintain the temperature setting inside.  Better cooling and heating temperatures, but mostly a $20.00+ savings on electric and gas per month. I should have done it sooner.

Working with Infinity, from the Representative to the Installation crew was a delight. They showed nothing but professionalism, character and answered any and all questions that I had.

Oh, I forgot to mention, the windows are beautiful. I get many comments and inquiries as to where I purchased them.

Thanks

<user>117060359439640666424< /user><text>Like Being Stalked by the Terminator T-2000 Series

A year and a half ago, two pleasant young people cruised our neighborhood looking for windows customers.  Little did I know that I'd have to leave the country and go off the grid to get away from their company, its incredibly overpriced offerings, and stalker behavior.

After the two youngsters, they sent out a former engineer whom we had to escort out of the house after two hours of his presentation, he hadn't even gotten to the heat lamp experiment.  We literally had to leave our own house to get him to leave and we weren't sure he was going to.

Then, we got the quote:  3 times the price of the vendor we did go with:  Coughlin.  Coughlin was professional, courteous, reasonably priced, and had a great product.

We told this vendor we'd made our choice, went with someone else, please stop calling.  I have asked them 3 times to take me off their list.  They just keep coming.  I blocked them on Verizon, they still somehow reach my phone.

Listen. And understand. That Infinity from Marvin by Veracity Window and Door is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead.< /text><Time>1551803232354< /Time><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< rate>

<Review>I love everything about my new windows.  They look fabulous, the color is sort of a light taupe, which is very attractive.
The  patio doors glide easily, and now I do not have small insects crawling under the old aluminum doors & windows, nor dust blowing in.

<review>I was very pleased with my experience with Infinity Windows and Doors and Marvin windows.  From the salesman to the installation everything went very smoothly.  The salesman made good suggestions for ideas that I had not thought of and that saved me money.  I would definitely recommend this company for windows and doors.

My Infinity windows by Marvin are wonderful! They cancel out noise and reduce the heat in my home.  They also look great and are quality construction.  Sean at Veracity was great to work with and I learned alot about their quality from him.  The installation went well.<//review>

I am in love with my new high end door! There have been a few glitches with the locking mechanism, however the new owner of the company has been most gracious and accommodating in getting those issues resolved. He has gone above and beyond. I would not hesitate to purchase another product from this company if I needed to.</Review>

<Text>Like most homes, to get to our backyard we had to go through a sliding glass door.  This was not an easy task for my husband who is in a wheelchair.  First, someone had to put a ramp in front of the door, then mats across the rails of the slider, and then another ramp to the outside.  We thought by taking out the slider and putting French doors in would solve this problem.  However we still had thresholds that were difficult to cross and now a door that was too narrow, and yes, we still had the ramps.   When I met your sales rep at the Home Show, I told him our dilemma and he said he could design a special door.  He came to the house and took measurements, and designed a beautiful French door that was extra wide to allow for the width of a wheelchair.  Furthermore he suggested a special threshold that was ADA compliant.  The installers who came to the house were efficient and courteous.  They cleaned up thoroughly when they were finished.  They took away my old door and wooden ramps and left me with a beautiful French door that matched my front door perfectly.  There is now no need for ugly ramps or mats, for my husband can now go outside through our new door without any problems with tracks, uneven thresholds or too narrow of a door.  All of which I was told by other window companies could not be done.  This is a long review, but people with disabilities need to know there is a company that can accommodate your special needs.  Thank you so much Marvin windows.< /Text><pics>None</pics><Resp>None</Resp><Time>1468954967542</Time></record>

<text>I purchased INFINITY FROM MARVIN  windows and doors about 10 months ago.  We are so very pleased with the windows and doors.  We had done research on different products but luckly we chose the INFINITY FROM MARVIN  windows and doors.  Great service and very professional staff.

A couple of weeks ago I called on a follow-up request for service and they were very quick to address a minor concern of mine.

I can't say enough or write enough to express how happy we are with the company, the prouct and their follow-up.  Jose and Abraham were very professional and courteous in addressing our request.

Sincerely, Gil</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I've used this company twice; first for all my window upgrades, then my doors. I've referred my relatives, they also replaced windows, then doors. Clearly we are happy customers. When my rental property requires window or door replacement, I'll be coming back.< /Review>

<Review>I had all windows in house replaced with Anderson brand.  Several styles including opaque bathroom windows, sliding windows, crank open windows as well as French doors and a bay window with wood trim. My reason for replacement was for security and better insulation.  The wi dows have accomplished both goals. They are beautiful and the installation was completed without a hitch.</Review><Response>None< /Response>< user_id>

Service prior to delivery was very professional - including "measuring twice" to make sure we had the right sized windows.  Installation was quick and minimally invasive.  Would most likely use for any other window upgrades.</text>

Strike 1) Tried to seat us at a table within three feet from a crowded waiting line during Covid.

Strike 2) 18% mandatory gratuity while requiring us to get up and stand in line to place our orders like a fast food joint.

Strike 3) Waited 20 minutes for an item that was verbally confirmed but was never registered nor came.< /Text>

The food was absolutely amazing. It was quite a different experience ordering at the host stand and having them bring everything out to you, but that's Covid for ya. Great service. Honestly felt kinda like getting food at a night market. Pretty fun over all<//text>

Not worth it.

For “dine in” right now they automatically charge an %18 gratuity. Normally I tip much higher than this but it’s kind of sad when you don’t get a single water refill or even a check back after food is delivered. I understand that restaurants have been / are struggling because of pandemic but service is service. And there was none at this location.

As far as food quality - I ordered 10 pc nigiri plate ($30) which was extremely underwhelming. Imitation crab on one, egg on another (2$ value at best!) sub par unagi, tako that wasn’t cut properly, and farmed salmon on another, the toro was also cut thinly as well as stretched to cover the rice, nori strips did not even reach all the way around and the rice was undercooked. All in all if I ordered the nigiri al la carte I would have gotten more for less money. RIP OFF.

My wonderful girlfriend ordered spicy tuna maki which she said she enjoyed and we both had veggie pot stickers as an app, pot stickers are obviously not made in house and bought frozen in bulk. 3/5 for the app.

The inside of the restaurant, although closed for seating, is a mess, and very dirty, disgusting everywhere you look.

If I could rate 0 stars I would!< /Review>

Foods great!! Little pricey.... Two regular dinner plates, a dragon roll.... Which is bomb!!!  And one hazy IPA... $80
Self serve... No waiters... That was a little inconvenient... Still a great time!!! Had to wait for 1 hr for six peeps.... That's also the max per table.... 👍😎< /Text>

< Review>
Sushi Confidential has two locations in the South Bay: San Jose and Campbell, both located in California. The location I will review and went to today was at the Downtown Campbell location. The downtown Campbell is located in Campbell, CA where there are a bunch of restaurants and little family owned stores. Right now, Sushi Confidential is doing take-out orders and outdoor dining due to COVID-19 and I saw the staff and the customers handling the protocols pretty good. I got my order pretty quickly and when I got home and ate the sushi, it was so delicious! I ordered 4 of their vegetarian rolls since I am a flexitarian.

The first roll I will review is their Anti- Phishing which is with spicy tofu, tempered green beans, topped with ahimi, avocado, unagi sauce, green onions. Ahimi is basically a play on raw tuna but it’s not raw tuna, it’s tomato but has that ahi tuna feel. To be fair, I thought there was no way tofu can be put into a sushi roll but it turns out they did! I really liked the tofu with the unagi sauce and avocado, I thought it gave the roll a nice freshness. I also liked how the tofu was soft and it actually had flavor that I absolutely enjoyed! I also liked the ahimi which was soft and it did taste like it was raw tuna but it’s not! I enjoyed how I can still have that “tuna” taste without eating any fish. I did wish the tofu was a bit spicier. I was expecting it to be slightly more spicy. To be fair, this was actually my favorite roll out of the 4 I got! Highly recommend this roll very much!

The second roll I got was their Snitch which is spicy tofu, cucumber, topped with avocado, spicy spy sauce, and sweet potato crisps. This roll was definitely spicer than the first roll which I really liked I thought that this roll had spicer tofu than the Anti-Phishing which I liked very much! I liked the avocado and cucumber so that the roll had some freshness and I like the spicy spy sauce, it complemented the roll very well. I did like the addition of the sweet potato crips, really nice texture element I do wish it was a bit crunchier. Overall, really liked the roll, it had every tasting element you should definitely taste ina sushi roll.

The third roll I got was DTF (Down to Fiesta) which is basically an avocado roll topped with fresh pico de gallo, jalapenos, Persian lime & jalapeno olive oil, sesame seeds. This was a really nice, fresh roll and l liked the addition of the other ingredients to help elevate the flavors of the sushi roll. I think a bit of lemon maybe would of helped get another flavor level of the sushi roll because I didn’t taste acidity which I think that’s what pico de gallo really needs. Either a lemon or lime would of helped the roll out more and tie in the flavors together. I do however really liked the fun fresh flavors they were going for I thought it was thought out!

The last roll I got was their Hollaback which has shiitake mushroom, cucumber, topped with avocado, lemon, garlic crisp, soy vinaigrette, and spicy sprouts. I really liked how mild this sushi roll was and all of the vegetables really helped tie the sushi roll together. I did like the lemon on top to give the roll acidity. I thought that was smart so all of the flavor components shined through. I did like the addition to the shiitake mushrooms because those were like the “meat” part of the sushi roll which was super filling. Overall, this sushi roll was delicious and perfect. I don’t have anything to say except, this was some great fresh sushi!

Overall, I really liked Sushi Confidential and this is definitely a must go spot if your ever in Campbell or San Jose! Their sushi rolls were very fresh and the rice was just right! Don’t forget to support local businesses like this one and check out their sushi! It’s really delicious and I love the variety of vegetarian/vegan sushi rolls! I wish there was more because I have a feeling their rolls are terrific and definitely I hope they come out with more vegetarian options in the future!

<Text>Less service for more money AND my roll was just okay- I’ve had so much better. Here’s the deal: You have to order your meal and drink then immediately pay- they automatically charge an 18% gratuity if you do outdoor seating. They brought out a beer and then came out one other time to drop off the food. Didn’t come and check to see if everything was good or if we needed anything else. I wanted another beer half way through my meal but in order to get this - you have to get up, wait in the order line and then order it separately and pay again - where they make you pay another 18% gratuity!!!??! The drinks are already $10 each and I’m already eating your food and I’ve already paid the 18%. Worst customer service ever. I can’t believe this business operates this way. If I’m already eating and had to interrupt my meal to wait in line and then order my beer - I should not have to pay the 18% again for them to walk it out. They don’t come by during your meal- they don’t come by after your meal to see how everything is. You do everything and then you’re on your own. I understand tipping for good service but this doesn’t make sense to me. The food is already higher priced (which I would happily pay for again - if it was good.. but this sushi was not that). Less service for more money. Too bad. Won’t be coming here again.<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

They make everything from spicy, crunchy sushi with tempura shrimp and light, citrus sushi with zest! Their Raman is delicious as well!

Don't miss their happy hour 3-6 and 9-close! Their ahi wonton tacos at happy hour are worth the visit!</review>< pics>

Went today on a Sunday. Looked like it started to pick up after the 49er game was over but everyone kept their distance. They had a great set up. We gave them our name and it was about a 15 minute wait so we walked around until the table was ready. They have little signs stating I'd the table was clean or dirty. Also, they had a sign for you to scan the menu from your phone. When you were ready to order you went to the table at the entrance. They have plexiglass separating you from the cashier. They even sanitized your card before swiping. They do add an 18% gratuity to your order for the whole staff to split, which is a great idea! They bring you ice water in plastic cups and a vase with ice cold water for you to refill yourself. Everyone had masks. Food was great! Sad they didn't have the green bean tower anymore but got the edamame instead. Those were addicting! Had a side of miso soup. We also ordered the spicy salmon roll (brought tears to my bf's eyes 🤣) and I had the geisha roll. The avocado with tempura were delicious. The sriracha mayo sauce with it was spicy but a good spicy. My brother in law got the bento box (which was huge!) The portions were great. My sister in law ordered from the vegan menu and was not disappointed. She had these cute crunchy sweet potatoes curled on her tofu roll. Super yummy! Great service and great tasting food. It was the perfect day to visit downtown Campbell. Not cheap but definitely tasty and worth the extra few bucks. Can't wait to come back here!<//Review>

Shishito peppers, Sake maki, and a spider roll. Service was fun, no host tonight but the wait staff filled in and made it fun. The peppers were fantastic. The sake had fresh salmon. The spider was good but a little cold. A hot version would be a 5 star.< /review>

The sushi is good, nothing too crazy but pretty good. Some roles we had were better than others. What I really appreciated about this place was all the cleaning measures they took due to covid. Not only they clean every table after each customer they even clean the chairs. They don't take reservations but they have a pretty good system for putting your name on the list. They have a QR code for menu. One draw back is you have to order at the door, but it's in a way safer and I don't mind it. They staff ask you to put your mask on when they bring your food, sure can be slightly annoying specially if you're already drinking or eating but I appreciate them being so a safe and protecting their staff & customers.
Definitely a place I trust through covid.< /Text>

<Text>Wanted to give a negative 10 but that was not an option.  Worst costumer service and food ever at this place. Snooty, condescending attitudes from the staff. Went 2 years ago and the server, a female was super rude.  When we arrived a young woman told us in a very rude manner, "Just go to the back! Jusyt go to the back!" What the!!😲That should have been the time we walked out but we didn't. Trufling people have no respect for customers! Rude, condescending, nasty and absolutely disgusting behavior for someone trying to make money!!  And the food was not all that back then!!  My husband and I wanted to enjoy time together, took another chance and went back to this place again ONLY because our favorite Sushi place was too far to drive from our home (east San jose). We thought that "maybe" we'd get a better experience being that our last incident happened 2 years ago.  Went in and the waiter, this time a male, just looked at us, no greeting and just stood there!! He never asked us what we'd like to order so I had to ask the guy if we could order now or was he busy. The guy said, "yes I can take your order and FINALLY  took our order!!!!  $80 later, food was subpar and the customer service was JUST AS BAD AS IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO. NEVER going back and SPREADING the news of the horrible service these folks provide! Ten thumbs down for the food AND for the HORRIBLE customer service!👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾<//Text>< Pictures>

Super disappointed. Take out order was late. Then when I get home after asking if the sauces were in the bag and they saying yes, no salad dressing for the 20 dollar salad so I have a few slices of tuna with a container of dry mixed greens. I should’ve known better. The only reason for 2 stars instead of 1 is because they had a great late night happy hour< /Review>

<text>We bought the Sushi Kit for 5 people. We made 10 sushi rolls of an amazing variety - thanks to all the tasty treats provided in the kit. We watched the video and it was really easy. We had a great family time creating all the rolls. And the food was amazing! Great fun, great dinner, great food. I recommend upgrading to the additional helpings of shriimp, salmon, and eel. Well worth it. We'll definitely be doing this again!< /text><username>Steve Nestle< /username>< UserId.>

<text>Good Sushi options, ambiance is good but service could have been better. But for good food I will try once again. try the happy hour food they are really good. Not enough options in happy hour drinks so you have to end up with menu options.</text>< Pictures>

The food and service are really good. The sake bombs are too small, but that might just be because I went during happy hour. I also loved the dog friendly patio.< /Review>

<Time>1604361528747< /Time><rating>2</rating><text>Overpriced ($15 for 3 tiny pork bao, $11 for a plate of gyoza) and poorly prepared. Bao completely lacked any sauce, making it dry and a bit flavorless. Teriyaki chicken donburi was assembled with sauce underneath the meat which allowed rice to become saturated and left the chicken naked. Purchased as takeout so no correction could be made. Wouldn’t complain if this were fast food but very disappointing at this level.<//text>< pics>

Our waiter didn't seem to have his game on (starting his shift) as we had to ask for utensils/chopsticks , napkins and I am not sure if we also had to ask but we never got our soup spoons. Other than that the food was good and price was not too bad. Would go back in a group would not ho out of my way for it.<//Review>< Resp>

Food was good, 18% tip is automatically added for sitting outside, you have to order at the entrance, so seems bizarre to tip in advance to have food brought to you?</text>

<review>Lots of outdoor seating, the restaurant takes COVID-19 precautions seriously. Prices are reasonable/a bit high, but the menu is quite varied (including an extensive vegan menu). The sashimi looked and tasted great, and the chicken katsu and salmon teriyaki were cooked perfectly, although the katsu sauce was a bit on the saltier side. Very friendly and attentive staff as well. Worth checking out for sushi in the area. Keep in mind if you choose to dine in they will automatically factor in an 18% gratuity in the bill.<//review>< response>

<review>The experience is literaly like eating to go meal on the street. You have to stand in line to order your food and pay for it up front. Then after 15-20 min they bring your sushi with to go soy sauce packs. And if you want something more, even if a tea, you have to again in line, order and pay for it.<//review>< Pics>

My go to spot for Sushi! Mainly because of their fantastic vegetarian sushi options. I've tried them all and they are delicious! The ambiance is good, downtown Campbell, prime location. Good cocktails too. Slightly expensive but totally worth every penny!< /review>

<review>I love Sushi Con but am writing this review because of the frustrating experience I have had recently, specifically tonight’s 2 hour wait for my takeout order. The last few times my orders via DoorDash have arrived after 90 minutes, much longer than the usual 45-60 minute wait. Tonight I called to get a status because of the time passed, was put on hold for over 15 min before I hung up and called again to discover they forgot about me on hold all that time. When I inquired about my order that had been placed over 90 minutes ago, they saw the order had already been prepared and hadn’t tagged the doordasher to pick it up. My food arrived and the cooked food was cold, and the raw fish was lukewarm and fishy. I recognize that times are tough adjusting to the new normal, but I write this in hopes that the feedback helps improve customer experience for the future. I’m a regular and want to support my local businesses in this time, but I don’t know if I can handle another 2 hour wait for raw fish to be delivered.<//review><Pics>None</Pics><resp>None< /resp><GmapID>0x808e34df1138295d:0xef39b8d601349874< /GmapID></record>

I realize this isn’t their fault but they need to staff a little better. Once you get your table there was a fifteen minute wait to order. Then we wanted to add to the order and it was another 20 minutes. Terrible process. Fix this and more will come. Keep this disorganization and go the way of the dinosaur.<//text>< pictures>

Usually a great place to meet for Happy Hour. Due to COVID restrictions, I presume, there is no HH and they also are charging an 18% gratuity to all patio diners- just FYI<//Text>

Once seated took FOREVER to get any waiter. Took so long to get a drink that bartender sent it with a shot. I had to ask another server walking by for table settings, they finally brought our food but never came back with utensils. I hope if I go back things will be back to a 5.

We picked a day that was 103' degrees outside. What a perfect place to cool down with hot sake. Fresh Sushi and beautiful people.  Great atmosphere</Text>

Been to a lot of Sushi places in the Bay Area and Sushi Confidential has excellent fresh fish and good service.   It often gets crowded at night, and when it does it isn't too loud like most places.  Sushi Confidential is my go to when I'm int he South Bay.<//Text>

<Text>This is my favorite sushi joint in the South Bay. The food is delicious, the options are varied, the prices are affordable, and the service is great. The restaurant offers typical Japanese fare, along with some interesting and tasty fusion-inspired dishes for those looking for something non-traditional. I try to come here any time I'm in town. Highly recommended.</Text>< response>

Usually give this place a 5 but man did we have lousy service last Sunday for lunch.  Almost every table dirty, then only Hostess to clean.  Once seated took FOREVER to get any waiter. Took so long to get a drink that bartender sent it with a shot. I had to ask another server walking by for table settings, they finally brought our food but never came back with utensils. I hope if I go back things will be back to a 5. If not, sorry to say, I might be done.</text>

Very disappointed as a tourist. Despite the "#1 restaurant" awards, the service staff failed to deliver our correct order. Not only was it incorrect, but almost added to our bill. Our supposed waitress took our order, and promised water. 20 minutes later, none of it was received. A different waiter retook our order, only for the requested items to be incorrect as well. Parties arriving later than us already had their orders completed. When our food finally arrived 30 minutes later, the rice used our dishes were either mushy or had too much vinegar. If Kirby was starving even he'd wouldn't want to dine here. Upon paying, the hostess apologized and said she'd speak to a manager. When she brought back the receipt, I figured we'd at least be a little compensated, nope. What did she talk to the manager about? To the cute guy who at least brought us water, thank you. 😉</text>

Excellent Sushi, along with excellent service.
The happy hour is the time to go eat and drink!  The prices are just wonderful and the choices on the menu range from California roll to soups and salads and hundreds of sushi types.</text>

<review>Busy Saturday night. Hostess gave us a 40 min wait time so we went to walk around. 15 mins later we get a call our table is ready and we weren't going to make it back in a few mins so I called to let them know. When. We got back there, the hostess said it had been too long and we weren't on the list anymore. Luckily we got seats at the sushi bar. Sushi was yummy so I'm glad it worked out.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Response>{'time': 1581086935103, 'text': 'So glad you enjoyed our yummy sushi, Natalie.

Waited 20 minutes no one came to ask for drinks or our order. Asked the Maitre D went to find the waiter but no luck. We got up to tell the Maitre D once more to tell him we are leaving and he pointed out the manager who came over, I told him how long we waited and all he said was sorry. He had the opportunity to say let me fix this but didn't  and just said good bye. I responded I plan to give you a bad review and he said thanks! WTH? BTW this was not the first time we had problems with service. The food is pretty marginal anyway, so adding bad service to the equation makes this a bad location to eat. Especially in Campbell where you have so many choices.</Text>

<text>Sticky tables is a terrible first impression. Cleaning them didn't make a difference. The smell inside wasn't so pleasant, so we decided to go across the street to OPA!
Hopefully they get better, I've heard great things about this spot a few years ago.<//text>< Pictures>

The service was good, hence the two stars. I can't recall the name of the roll I got, but it was absolutely drenched in sauce. I don't mean a line of sauce over the top of the roll, I mean drenched, as in it's basically all I could taste.

Maybe I went on a bad day, maybe I'll give it another shot, but not likely considering the abundance of sushi joints in the area.< /Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Text>May be the best sushi but certainly not the best service especially to millennials, if the person that helped me, I hope you’re reading this, and I really hope you grow up and learn some soft skills and awareness because that was by far the worse service ever, and I’m being polite.

And not only you, a lot of people seem to have attitudes, just fix your mood... it was really unexpected and unnecessary for  what you did.

And the saddest part is that the main boss was there and he was just as worse... Selective service needs to be stopped<//Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

I have no complaints about this sushi restaurant, fully admitting I am not the kind of person who asks whether they have fresh uni today, or whatever it is serious sushi people ask.You can get a roll with crunchy things and spicy mayo sauce, totally satisfying those of us with less rarified palates.

I gave it higher stars for two main reasons:
1) It is delightful to sit on the patio here for lunch during a Sunday farmer's market, and
2) The kids' meal is in my top 5 kids meals I have encountered. It has real fruit AND real vegetables in it. The day we were there I joyfully watched my toddler eat edamame and fresh strawberries instead of just tan things from the deep frier. It comes with very yummy sweet potato fries, which I ate most of for my kid. There are many options, including salmon. A delight.<//text>

One of only a couple Sushi restaurants that have defined gluten free menus in the greater SV area. Sushi Confidential is a place for novelty rolls. They do have sushi and sashimi, but I wouldn't recommend them as the best place for that. Their rolls are unique and flavorful without stretching the limits of your palette. Pricing is reasonable and the saki serving sizes are generous.</Review>

I had to leave a review for this place. They have the best customer services, as soon as I walked into this place the gentleman in the front was very nice. The food was delicious and our waiter was great..not only that but.... I walked out this place and didn’t realize I had left my purse behind and I hear someone running behind me and it was the waiter who ran almost a block  to catch up to me to give me my purse back! This was extremely nice of him!!

Definitely great food and customer service!!! I will be back for sure and bringing a few friends here again!!< /review>

The food  may be good, but I wouldn't know. Place was 60percent of capacity and we waited an hour watching more and more people walking out we could visually see 10 to 12 empty tables of all sizes. We walked down to flights and were seated the moment we got there.
I'll probably never try come back to this restaurant. We were there Sunday July 8th @6pm. We left to another restraint just before 7pm.< /review>

<Review>Great service - literally all day long (11:30am - 11pm)! Try the Seared Ahi tuna salad - my only disappointment is when I looked down and noticed it was all gone! Great flavor, super fresh Ahi and the greens were all fresh and well mixed. I also had the Geisha sushi roll - JUST TRY IT!!!!

Awesome place. I’m looking for a home near by....

5 Solid stars!

We’ve been a couple times, and it was awesome both times. It’s a popular spot, so prepare to wait on Friday or Saturday. The last time we sat at the sushi bar. The chefs are real pros - very entertaining. They have a custom sushi menu with some very creative offerings. Parking is available on the street or even the next street over. Prepare to walk, but lots of nice shops along the way.<//review>

The food is EXCELLENT!!!!! Really fresh 👌 I've been a regular here since they opened because I work in downtown Campbell. I refer everyone I know to try them. I used to eat here at least once a week but the prices have gone up so now I go twice a month. The service is great but can be mediocre when it's busy. This is my FAVORITE Sushi spot! So yummy 🙌</Text>

It's a fun place to have a nice dinner on a Friday night. What I really enjoy is that when they have a long wait they will take down your phone number and send you a text message so you can walk around downtown Campbell and you don't have to wait outside the restaurant. The wait staff are very friendly and they check in often enough where it's not overwhelming but enough where you feel you are still being tended to. It's good for a small group of friends anywhere between 2 to 4, maybe 6 at the most so it's not for big crowds.<//review>

Sushi and sake are pretty good. They also have happy hour on food and drinks. They stay open to 11:30pm, I believe, which is nice if you're looking to eat dinner later than usual and not tryna eat crappy fast food. The waitress, Elise, who helped me was nice. The other waitress who was supposed to be my server disappeared without a word. Yeah, this rating isn't for her. It all worked out in the end & I enjoyed my meal. Definitely recommend.< /text>

Waited 25 minutes and nobody came to our table to even ask us if we wanted to order drinks. By the time we got up to leave since no one came to ask for our order people who had been seated right before us already had all their food and were almost done with their meal. Very bad customer service.</Text>

We love the sushi here and sitting out on the front patio is a great place to people watch and enjoy a yummy meal with friends. The service is usually pretty poor, with food taking a really long time to come out and/or orders being forgotten, but despite that we still love this place for the food. The servers are also friendly.<//review>

Modern sushi restaurant. I like Golden Philly roll very much!
Many sushi restaurants work until 9.30 pm. This restaurant usually works to 11.30 pm. Good place for late dinner.  Also I like happy hours which start at 10 pm every day..))</review>

My friends and I went to Sushi Confidential in Campbell the other night and the happy hour prices and offers were pretty good. They had $5 sushi rolls and $5 margaritas, cocktails, lemon drops and $3 saki bombs. Good price for late night eating and drinking. A plus was they were open late on a weekday, we went on a Tuesday night and they close at 11:30pm. The service was great, will definitely come here again!<//Text>

The food is fantastic. It includes traditional Japanese dishes and some unique items that combine American and Japanese cuisine. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is fun and open.< /Text>

<Review>When they first opened, I would frequent the place often.  But over the years quality seemed to have declined.  I had the tempura on my last visit a few months ago and the batter was thick hence biting into the broccoli you could taste the raw batter. I have gotten an upset stomach a couple of times from the raw food. I stop going there. It’s not cheap but that’s typical of sushi. Service wise,  it’s hit or miss.< /Review>< user_id>

We love eating here! The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because it is a tad pricey for our large family. Food is soooooo good though, service is usually pretty friendly and fast.  The restaurant is very clean and we love that it is downtown.< /text>

<Review>The person serving us seemed to be distracted with talking to her co-workers, which was a bit annoying. We ordered the Katsu plate. The rice was great, but the chicken was dry and not as fresh or warm as I like. We also ordered sushi which was better, but still was lacking on the flavor, in my opinion. Overall the ambiance was great, but the food and service did not match.<//Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><username>Daniel Gonzalez<//username></record>

<Review>Great ambience and creative sushi rolls. What hasn't approved in the last 4 years is the customer service. Waiters rarely check up on you, and usually have a stressed demeanor.

Their happy hour is actually pretty good and it's a good deal! The poke tacos (we got the tuna ones) were delicious and the shell was light and crispy. The rolls we got ranged from $7-9 for 5 or 8 pieces. The nigiri was worth it too; the pieces were pretty long and the fish tasted pretty fresh. My only complaint would be the sweet potato fries -- they need to ease up on the salt.</text>

Definitely a great place to eat just a bit busy and it can show a bit, just dont take it to heart and understand. The staff is always seems cheerful and accommodating.They don't skim on anything. My fish tacos were filled with fish! Their food is delicious and seems fresh!< /Review>

Overpriced, forgetful staff, orders always wrong. I still come here once in awhile for convenience but I would choose elsewhere.</Text>

<GmapID>0x808e34df1138295d:0xef39b8d601349874<//GmapID><text>I'm not sure how this place ever became so popular, but I suppose everyone has their own priorities.

The top of my sushi scale is currently Izaka-ya, which is like someone ripped a restaurant up out of Japanese soil by its roots and slammed it back down by the San Jose airport.
Sushi Confidential is seated solidly at the bottom, just above the sushi they serve at Google X (which is invariably soggy and tastes the way mildew smells). It's pretty uncommon for me to be able to pinpoint a restaurant's exact location in my internal rating scale, but this one is easy.

When we tried eating here, we had a very difficult time with their menu, which is heavily westernized. As I recall, nearly every sushi roll was spicy or contained nuts or another oddball element.
I don't recall what I wound up ordering - one of the traditional rolls, maybe a rainbow - but I do remember remarking that their creativity must be for the sake of hiding the flavour of the fish, itself. My wife was similarly unhappy with her food, but the real showstopper was the tempura shrimp and vegetables which, within a single dish, exhibited a range from overcooked mush to still having ice on it. This seemed to confirm my suspicion that the fish was from frozen.
Overall, it was a very poor showing. I could argue that we only caught them on a bad day, but it's pretty tough to recover from serving food from frozen, particularly when you are a sushi restaurant. Fresh fish is sort of the entire idea.

The service was good.
When the waitress served us, she accidentally dropped some of the food on the table and then left it there, which we found surprising and tactless. Later on in the meal, a waiter overheard us discussing the low-quality food and odd service and immediately reported it to a manager, who came over to personally apologize and ask for feedback. We thought her attentiveness and the fact that a server cared enough to escalate what he'd overheard spoke well of their staff. The tempura was removed from our bill.

Not interested in trying again.<//text><response>None< /response>< user_name>

<review>Vegan/lactose intolerant people beware! We ordered off the vegan menu and halfway through eating the roll, we discovered there was cream cheese in it. After letting the server know, he apologized but didn’t offer to reduce our check. It was also very overpriced.< /review>< name>

I never write reviews, but this place was gross, way way over priced and the portions were super small (even for sushi).  Great place if you're rich, white, and have the palette of a Labradoodle. Couldn't pay me to eat here again. Yuck</Review>

Excellent food, good service, very unique choices. Seriously the juiciest terriyaki chicken around. The downside though, no dinner bentos, and in total it's way more expensive (like dinner for 2 is easily close to if not more than $100 vs like ~$50-$80 at other places). If you like a selection of things no one else has, and want to try new stuff that's very good quality, try them out. The food doesn't disappoint.< /Text>

Very friendly staff, but the quality of the sushi was lacking. However, open late if you're in a bind. When friends and I went, they seemed to be having a very popular late night happy hour.</Text>

<Review>Service is great and the food is even better! It's a great place to go to celebrate, as well as taking friends and family. The Geisha Girl roll and the Santa Cruz Mermaid was our first roll we tried there and we have been hooked ever since. The garlic edamame and tempura avocado is fantastic! I would recommend it any day, any where!</Review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Time>

<user_id>102820370663806541110<//user_id><Review>Good happy hour prices 4-6, a patio for the dog.  had a good initial reception from hostess but it went down hill from there.  Sat in the sun while other tables that sat after us got water, then another while for drinks. We also had to wait for wasabi and ginger after or sushi was served. We weren't really even sure if we had a waitress.  Food was good though and we like sidewalk sitting so we'll probably be back.</Review>< username>

Their happy hour menu is my favorite. The prices are amzing and the food quality is right up there. Also - if you get the chance... ask for the chef special. We have enioyed this more times than I can list and have never been disappointed.< /Text>

Very fresh fish is used in the making of this sushi. The tuna nigiri literally melts in your mouth. Their selection of Sake is excellent. The wait staff is very attentive. If you go on a weekend evening, make sure to make reservations-- And ask to sit outside!< /review>

I feel this is the best sushi restaurant for someone who has never has sushi before. For someone who has ventured to every sushi restaurant in the Bay Area, it's ok but isn't that memorable compared to other restaurants.<//text>

Service is the worst, once we were told by our waitress that they had forgotten about our order, all of servers have forgotten something, generally non-alcoholic drinks!

Over complicated sushi options, feels westernized. We came due to tje gluten free options, they ended up having only some rolls. Most of the menu does not have gf versions.
My daughter got the sushi, they gave her gf soy sauce. But she spent all night throwing up, so likely the soy sauce was not really gf.< /review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Terrific sushi...at a price. I think that about sums it up. If you have the cash to shell out you won't be disappointed.

One downside was that it's quite loud inside but I'm told sitting outside is very nice.<//review>

< review>
This is my go to sushi spot in the bay area.  Been dinning here for a year or two and always have great service, fresh sushi, poke tacos, you name it, it's good.  If you head out to Campbell I'd recommend stopping in for the reverse happy hour (10pm to close) to grab some good food and cheap drinks.  Since they just stepped up their breakfast game, I figured I'd write a quick review after having a pork belly burrito (soooo good)   while watching the NFL ticket drinking a bottomless mimosa,  icing on the cake.<//review>

Reminds me of a old school saki bomb place you party at with friends with the music and vibe but that is what make it unique. Then the food makes it a regular go to. Don't be afraid to invite business clients as well as it always seems to please out of towners.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Wonderful sushi! It's a little on the pricy side if it's not happy hour, but I think it's worth it because of their creative dishes. This is not your typical sushi place.</Text>

I love sushi as much as Kanye West loves himself, well, maybe a little less. I came here for the second time with a friend, on a Thursday night, I ordered some rolls, which was hella delicious by the way, my friend ordered soup, seaweed salad (I know gross, but hey let’s not judge) and the “TUNA POKE BOWL”, she got food poisoning the next day and had to miss work. Please STAY away from the Tuna POKE BOWL unless you want to feel like Cosby’s last victim, drugged, disoriented, confused and battered.
Sushi is pretty good and reasonably priced in this place, but drinks are very expensive though, even more expensive than the rolls. I would recommend to just drink the yellow murky tap water that the city of Campbell has to offer. It was hard not to notice the noise coming from the kitchen, loud music from the speaker, loud game on TV and people yelling at each other. I love the option this place offers, you can either watch the game or listen to music at the same time, they are equally loud, you just need to have selective hearing.
I also love when elderly people just let themselves go and drink and act like Vikings disregarding their surroundings, very entertaining to watch, but not fun when it is happening five feet away from you, what a pretty mess and eyesore at the same time. If you just had a hip or knee replacement and just want to party like a rock star this place will fit you perfectly.
I think I will return to this place when the weather gets warm so I can sit outside and avoid the telenovela, but if you like the feeling of being a Jerry Springer’s panelist you should definitely go inside. Gosh, I love this place <hesitating look>.< /text>

<Review>F*****g right five stars. Don't confuse the 'bro' like ambience for an upscale rubios tacos. This place has extremely fresh and delicious sushi (no rainbow or sushi rolls on fire reviews here). The staff is a hybrid of hipsters and sushi geeks that give the usual sushi chef line up a run for their money. They're really creative too.

If you're looking for the Asian ambience of your run of the mill sushi spot, you're better off at pf  changs.

However if you want truly fresh and authentic sushi in Campbell, this is your spot.< /Review>< gmap_id>

First, I never had a chance to try to the food. So if you're looking for a food review no need to read on.

As a previous hostess & server at many restaurants (two that I helped start & open), I understand what goes into creating an amazing experience for guests in the first couple weeks. Unfortunately, I think there are some kinks to work out, including looking for a new manager. I have never in my life been treated so horribly rude by a manager to the point where I was no longer interested in eating at the restaurant, and decided to walk out.

The Manager that was working on Saturday evening (5/5) was the rudest staff I have ever met at a restaurant, ever! If I was the owner of the restaurant I would be ashamed to know how he treated my customers and how he represented my new establishment.<//Text>

Although the food is good, I found the atmosphere wanting.  The noise level makes communication with your mates nearly impossible.  The service was very slow.< /Review>

Happy hour + sushi + 4 year old? Hmm, why not. Ordered the chicken nuggets kids spybox that comes with edamame, sweet potato fries and strawberries. I should've ordered this! But with a selection of Tuna truffle and Cabo rolls, it makes it easy to pass on the happy meal. Oh and the pineapple sake and pear sake bombs we're also really good :) Gotta head back now.< /Text>

One of the few places in downtown Campbell that's open late.  Service is good; food is pretty good; and the drinks are tasty and sometimes creative.</text>

<Text>One of my favorite sushi places.  Period!

The happy hour is really good.  3 to 6 and 10 to close EVERY DAY!  Great prices on a good selection of rolls including some of their specialty rolls.  The tempura avocado is on there as a starter and I could just eat the entire plate of melt in your mouth deliciousness!  So good!

I also love the Cabo Conspiracy and the California Confidential.  The edamame trio is pretty darn good.  3 different sauces and enough for 6, a bit much for 2 to share.  Take the leftovers of it home.

One of the best things is the outdoor seating on the sidewalk.  Downtown Campbell is a lovely place to be on a warm spring/summer/fall day and to sit outside and people watch while enjoying some great sushi is a beautiful thing!

Edit 5/2017 handicap accessible bar!!  😁

Yeah, I'll be going again and again!  #ReviewLocal< /Text>< pics>

<Text>I have been going here since it opened and have had a great meal every time! I totally would recommend the geshi girl and the deep fried avocado.

The food was horrible. I didn't even finish the 8 pieces of $25 sashimi because some of it was so old it had a toughened exterior...gross. No wasabi or ginger and I had to ask for soy sauce. Garbage!<//text>< gmap_id>

Came here with a friend for lunch. Ordered some nagiri and a spicy tuna roll with cream cheese and shishito peppers. Everthing was super good. My friend had a tempura fried roll which was also great.

Great location. Service was just ok. But will definitely come back.</text>

Hour wait for outside.  Service was slow.  Drink glass was dirty.  Food was decent but overpriced.  There are many better sushi options so will not return.</text>

Good place for sushi if you’re mainly looking to have some fun and socialize in the middle of downtown Campbell.< /review>

Second time / same problem! We wait 20 min for waiter to take order, then abandoned without even water for 40 min, ordered tea and soup that never came even when sushi finally did, sushi fish not that fresh but tolerable, flavor good, abandoned again with noone to talk to about order issues, waiters chatting with eachother or with friends nearby, this second time here with these issues our waitress felt bad and comped us for soup and tea which finally came near end, felt service only works decently during less crowded times but night is horrendous. Noisiest crapp here too - people allowed to yell repeatedly, music blasting, plates loudly landing in the kitchen and staff doing nothing to assist these issues. I’m a DJ so I’m used to noise but this is ridiculous. They need soundproofing!!!

Update: Years later we returned (drawn to the vegetarian gyoza and geisha roll) and had a good experience but then when we returned again after that, it was the same issue with noise. Horrendous! Service was a bit better but we’re upset that two groups were allowed to bang on tables and yell over and over. And the dishes in the back were still being moved and set down overly loudly. Everything echoes like a demon here. Way too freaking cold too.</text>

<pics>None</pics><Text>I'm extremely dissapointed in the quality of the food we got last night.
We've been going to Sushi Confidential for a few years now. and they've usually provided pretty good sushi.  Working 2 jobs and having a new untrained puppy, I've been ordering via Door Dash a lot lately. And again, usually the quality is good and the food comes very quickly.
We decided to order in from Sushi Confidential last night after a long day of travel.

We ordered A LOT. Ramen for my non sushi loving dog sitter, 5 rolls and salmon nigiri for the rest of us.
So when the food was running late, and our Door Dasher had to text to say he was still waiting, we weren't upset.  The food was delivered about a half hour late, again, we weren't upset. Until we divided up and we all dug in. My dog sitter loved her ramen, so that was nice.
But the sushi rolls were horrible.  Some were rolled in half cooked rice while the rest were rolled in mushy way overcooked rice. If my food is going to be late, I expect it to be properly cooked.  We also received sashimi and not nigiri. Which I mean.. we could have let that slide. But nothing was good about the rolls we received.  And I spent well over $100 on a garbage meal.  I've already alerted DoorDash, but this isn't their fault, our Dasher was great. It was the restaurant who failed us last night.
Normally this place is pretty solid.  There are several places that have better quality and prices, but for decent sushi in a convenient location, you usually can't beat this place.   But after last night i'll be rethinking all future sushi orders.</Text><Time>1475794128896<//Time><user_name>Vanessa Lagemann< /user_name>< gmap_id>

The food is ok, the service is ok.

We came here for dinner one night, ordered the garlic edamame $6, and it was pretty tasty. We also ordered the Geisha girl roll $15 which was ok, a bit too much rice on it and really expensive for a roll. The tonkasu ramen $15 was a huge bowl of salty goodness, the broth was flavorful and there was a lot of pork in it. The only problem was the ramen was a giant clum and not cooked throughly. I spoke to the waiter about it and he immediately took it back and made me a new one.

The manager came over and apologized for it and offered us another dish. So we ordered the Agedashi tofu appetizer and it was a major fail. The tofu was way too sweet and kinda hard, and the tofu was deep fried in tempura batter which is completely wrong way of cooking it. In addition, the garnish was at the bottom buried under the tofu when it should be on top.

Service was attentive and we really like the outside patio seating area.</Text>
