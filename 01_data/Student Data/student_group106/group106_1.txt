<Rating>4</Rating><text>We went on a quiet Thursday afternoon. Their Hong Kong waffle is worth every penny. It's amazing, crispy on the outside light and fluffy on the inside, it comes out freshly made to order every time!  There's dozens of fillings to choose from for only 50 cents more, and there's different flavor waffles including mochi, green tea, chocolate etc.< /text>< pics>

The chai latte is a little weak on the spice side, so maybe ask for extra chai. The jasmine peach cold brew tea was really good:) this is in a really really nice location. The shopping center has so many shops and restaurants, there's a fountain, and multiple neat lounge areas, and a koi fish pond. Super nice:)< /Text>

I love the early mornings before the gym. My cup of coffee keeps me warm as I make my way to 24 Hour Fitness. My coffee gets to me quick and served with a friendly smile. Great way to start your day:) check it out.<//Review>

<text>Great coffee.  Simple as that.

Cool place to hang out and get some work done.  The only thing, I wish there were some more power outlets in case you need to plug in.

Would definitely go back.< /text>< resp>

Coffee Bean is the only place I go for blended coffee! The winter dream tea is my absolute favorite every holiday season! And the chai blend here is also delicious. They are very accommodating to milk and powder substitutions. I always have to get half powder because the full scoop they add is a bit too sweet for me. Happy to see this location is always busy and many customers sit and lounge on their laptops, it's not the quietest space but definitely a friendly staff.< /text>

The person making coffee was so lazy to change the coffee powder in the filter before making an Expresso shot. Usually this place has good coffee, but the staff is lazy and not so friendly. I believe the management is very relaxed and don’t care about their customers.<//Text>

<text>I walked in this morning to get a drink while I waited for the stores to open (it's Saturday morning). I ordered a matcha latte. Sat down outside to enjoy but realized it was too sweet. I usually ask if the matcha is sweetened but forgot to do so here. I was gonna let it go and just dump the drink. But I had another 45 minutes before the stores opened. So I went in and asked the young man at the register if there was any way I could change my drink. Not only did he agree to do so with a kind smile, he brought it out for me when it was ready. I'm impressed. The five stars is purely for the service.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

The worst customer service from the new store manager. This is the second time I have tried to express my opinion. Thought it would be heard on google, however my fair review was deleted. I would give this place negative stars if it was an option. The store manager should be pleasant. She IS NOT! I< /review>

Good coffee shop but can get crowded at times.  I try to go when it's not crowded and buy enough since I like to work a while.  They should do something about the acoustics though.  The machines there are loud and everything a chair is moved it's like an earthquake.</review>

Great if you're looking for a 500 calorie drink. Getting a dark roast or decaf after 11AM is an exercise in futility, as the barista did not understand the difference between coffee and a watered down espresso and had no idea how to small batch a cup.</review>

For how busy this location is they should have more associates to keep up with the traffic. Always messy, and trash always overflowing. This has nothing to to with the associates there they are clearly understaffed. This location needs more associates to keep up with the large traffic demand.< /Review>

<text>The Ventura County Family Courts don’t care about the child’s best interest. They just want to cut the child in half between the two parents, like the story of the two mothers and King Solomon. This is not just my opinion. I have talked to more than a dozen people that have experienced the same results that I have seen. One 2-year-old little girl was divided in a 2-2-3 fashion. She lives 50% of the time with the mother and the other 50% of the time with the father and his three 20-year-old men roommates. This is a recipe for disaster! Another mother that I know has to drive 200 miles twice a week to get her son from his father. A third mom told me that she had to drive to another state every week to collect or return her children from their father on a week-on/week-off visitation schedule. I have also talked with a lady who worked with the court system for almost 9 years and finally quit because she saw the horrible decisions the judges made and just got sick of it! I believe the courts need to start thinking about the child first. Young children should not be shuffled back and forth like a yo-yo. There should always be a primary parent with visitation (when appropriate) for the other parent. Children need stability and the Ventura County Courts think that as long as the parents have equal time, it must be okay. This is so wrong! The rating of one star is too high for the Family Courts. It’s too bad that there isn’t an option for negative stars.<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<time>1600406146995</time><Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Like alot of people I felt unherd . I felt like I was judged by how I look.  I put all my faith in the vc courts in my family court case.  The judge cared.  He made ruling based on facts. And was very fair in how he conducted his courtroom. He shared wisdom during his ruling that i will forever remember and apply to my life.  I never thought I would be leaving a review for a courthouse.  But today my life changed and if anyone out there is worried they won't be herd like I was. I hope you know this won't be the case. Be calm. Be honest.  Talk slow so the court reporter can type and you will be good. They are the best court I ever dealt with.
I hope to never go back there again.< /Review>< Pics>

<Text>Horrid customer service. Listen, I understand they've got quotas to fill and don't have time to answer the questions of the hordes of people flowing through on a daily basis. But at the very least, treat people respectfully. Virtually every staff member was condescending and dismissive of any person who had a question or stepped out of line in any regard. I cannot believe the level of toxicity these people have.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<Date>1588526763667</Date><review>Horrible system 5 years ago my ex divorced me. We have two kids and at the time of divorce I made some bad choices. Witch I suffered the consequences the lady that did mediation made sure of that. After doing all I could to change my ways including. Alcohol and drug classes, parenting classes, I changed my life 100% I’m a completely different person now. I went back to try and get more time with our kids. The same mediator who looked at me like the same garbage she presumed me to be. I brought so much proof pertaining to my new life long changes. Character letters and all. The system just took more time from me. Ventura court is not a court of justice. They only care about money. I’m praying this one day will change. Need God back into our court system.< /review>< Pics>

<Review>Our court house can be helpful. But you have to understand. The person in front of you give any of these employees and even the Judges a hard time the next person in line to be heard gets the worst of it because they are already pist off. Believe i been in those shoes. Today i stay away from those rooms. Their phone system really sucks for sure. Collection dept need to stop acting like i owe them the money. You request to see a Judge and they tell you No. The collection dept.  has control over that. Collection is the worst in our court house. I think.</Review>< pics>

<Pictures>None< /Pictures><username>Evelyn M Barsom<//username><Review>I have been denied my basic civil rights. My court minutes where given unto a court official by the balliff. Then I was given a B.S. excuse to why my papers were not ready.
I have asked for an actual up to date copy of a dead family members will to read on my own accord to see if what is happening is as it should be...
Excuses and no such proof or evidence the will exists or not???? B.S.
One last point needing to be made....
December the 6th of the year 2017 there is not one record of an unlawful detainer nor is there any mention on the court documents that on December 19th 2017 that 1845 Montgomery Ave Ventura California 93004 there would be an eviction carried out.
This is all inside court lawyer former District Attorney now commissioner court room 11 former deputy probation officer makings. Nothing was filed nor heard. This is illegal.< /Review></record>

<Review>It's a joke.  I always tell people to just mind their p's and Q's and don't get into trouble. That's the best way to stay away from this place.  From what I hear the jail is worse. From what I've seen from outside looking in as a visitor they are right.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

They had a lot of customers today and seemed like they were rushing the haircuts to get the next customer in the chair. They do not take credit cards either. CASH ONLY. They asked me to take off my mask when I sat down. They do not take temperature of incoming customers either.

As for the actual cut, it wasn't the best haircut, but it will do.

This was my first time here so I decided to go give it a try. I probably won't be coming back as I don't like it when they rush and dont take their time.

It's convenient though.<//text>< pics>

Ron is a true master of his craft. My haircut is perfect every time. In addition, the shop is always clean and all the barbers are true professionals. It is the only place I will go for a haircut.< /text>

<Text>So I am new to the area just  figured what out a barbershop right across the street how convenient  And when I looked up the reviews I was kind of impressed only to come to find out what a nightmare this place is been here about five or six times  I always get sent to the two new barbers would look like they’re practicing on my hair  I have requested to make appointments with other barbers but they all swear like they’re too busy to take on new client If you are too busy making money that’s perfectly fine I will take my business somewhere else where it is appreciated and by the way they’re always speaking another language And on the phone most of the time they are cutting your hair worst experience ever<//Text>< pics>

I have been getting my haircut by Alex for over a decade. He does a excellent job and is really good with a straight razor if you want to get a shave.</text>

First time customer. While it cost more then I like to pay, the service was outstanding. I didn't have to wait at all. As soon as I walked in George greeted me and started cutting. First time for straight edge shave for me. I will go back definitely.< /Review>

Excellent shop, I highly recommend it. Great atmosphere and prices. Barbers are first class. Received a fantastic cut, finished with a wet razor around the edges. Walk ins receive fast service. I'll be a regular customer now.<//Text>

It was HORRIBLE! When I went back to get it fixed (by Jack my regular) he even commented about the cut and showed me one portion where it was uneven by a few inches at least. Literally the last time I wen't in there. Jack and Mark and the Owner are the only ones I'd trust..<//Text>< Pics>

I moved out of state and every single time we drive to southern California we make a stop (regardless of how out of the way it is) and order anywhere from 20-30 tacos to feed our family. We can't get enough. True hidden gem.</Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Was getting over a flu. Went there and picked up their Cocido (caldo de res/beef stew). It was like I was reborn! Delicious and had all that I needed to get back to normal, even better!

I also regularly have their chorizo breakfast. Best in town!!</Review>

Its a classic Mexican place that serves just about everything that you can think of from tacos to burritos to soups plus more. When I'm feeling lazy I like to dine in or take something home. Its 1 of my many go-to spots in RH. Good quality food at a reasonable price. Love the staff. They are very friendly. Especially the owner who is there all the time.<//Text>< username>

Fajitas are fresh. Unfortunately the rest is warmed in the microwave. Great tasting food but poor appearance in warming up food and small hallway. No standing room.</review>

Thought the place was really good. A little hole in the wall place you would just pass up if you didnt see it, but usually those type of places are the best. The food is really good and i find myself coming here more and more. Think the pricing is a lil higher on some items then usual but the foods worth it. The establishment is always clean when i go in and the staff members are all friendly. If you are trying to find a place with good authentic Mexican food look no further.</text>

<text>I haven't been back.
It still blows me away how my
3 year old son and I ate over $25 worth of food.(shared the plate).
I don't see where the Gourmet prices kick in.
Found 3 other affordable spots.</text>< Rate>

The good news is that the food here is absolutely delicious, we had the pizza panini and create your own salad, and both were perfectly satisfying.  The staff were helpful and the place overall was clean and decorated tastefully.

However I can’t in good conscience give this place a full 5 stars because they were advertising about 5 specials and were out of ingredients for at least two of them (my first and second choices).  One was the jackfruit salad or panini, can’t remember exactly, and I can’t remember the other.  Apparently there was a lunch rush that used up the main ingredients.  The problem was that even though they were out of two specials they left the signs up for them.  Then, at least two times the employees offered to help me with ordering, but neither time did they inform me they were out of the specials.  I only found out when I actually tried to order one, and then after being disappointed, tried to order the second, which of course was out too.  This is not a problem necessarily with food stocking, but more a problem of good employee training.  Sometimes I go into a restaurant after looking at the specials I see advertised, and when they’re out, it feels a little like a bait and switch, even if it’s unintentional.<//Text>

I'm the kind of guy that orders bacon on my bacon. 3 burger patties. 2 racks of ribs.. meat me all day.. and I can easily say Organic Junkie makes me forget about all of that. I have yet to tey something I haven't loved, and I never make it out of my parking spot before I kill whatever it is I ordered. Vegan or not you have to try this place! Oh and they got FIRE smoothie bowl! And yes that was keeping it simple so just imagine!< /Text>

This is my 2nd time at this place. Today I ordered the ceviche. The only way I can describe  it is “Jesus take the wheel on this one because it’s out of this world!” It is so good! The staff is super friendly and I’ll definitely be back.</text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Text>I had the pleasure of meeting the owner of this great little spot. She was awesome. Dedicated to her restaurant. She has a strong conviction for making quality food taste GREAT! She’s knowledgeable and VERY transparent with the ingredients she uses in the items on the menu. She strongly supports LOCAL businesses and tries to buy from them instead of buying from large chains. I love that. The Açai bowl was probably one of the TASTIEST bowls I’ve had. I travel the US with my husband on business a lot so I get to try quite a bit! Anyway, go support this AMAZING place. You won’t be sorry.< /Text></record>

My friend is vegan and he wanted to meet up for a late breakfast @10am so he picked this place. I browsed the menu and it was hard to understand the choices. None of the sandwiches they have are even on the menu. I decided to get a "create-your-own" salad instead and they didn't even have the zucchini noodles which is rated customer fave. I went there for my first time and it'll be my last. I wasn't a fan of the salad and everything to put in costed extra.< /Text>

Honestly was quiet surprised with my experience at Organic Junkie. I am not a fan of anything healthy lol, but I surprisingly found some food that fits my normal diet but it is healthier for me! Absolutely great environment and such a professional man I spoke to! Thank you guys for getting me to eat healthy again!<//Review>

This place is awesome! Clean and friendly atmosphere. Positive vibes! The food is so fresh and most important, great tasting!! Try the vegan albóndiga soup when they have it. So good! Their hempseed horchata is a must try if you're into horchata. We had the jackfruit crunch wrap! Very yummy...We also tried the heart of palm ceviche!! Kids asked for a second plate!! There's also a kombucha bar. I live kombucha and will try next time... 😋< /Text>

First time eating at Organic Junkie. Met up for late lunch here with a friend who is vegan. I had the Pizza Panini & salad. The panini was just okay for me. I think it needed to be cooked/heated longer. The staff were very friendly & helpful! Inside was clean & well maintained, including the restroom. Great place to grab a healthy meal.</text>

<text>Having breakfast late on a Friday and not many options, so I stopped by to try it out.  Glad I did because the smoothie bowl that Christina recommended tasted great, and it was healthy and fresh!  After sampling the sauces and the ceviche lunch I'll definitely be coming back for lunch. Friendly people and great location too!<//text><pics>None<//pics>< Response>

No bottled water, only small cups of water. Much better salads available elsewhere. Hopefully as they go along they will improve veggie selections.<//Review>< response>

<Review>Best spot in Corona hands down will have you coming back for more. Definitely try the ceviche and pizza panini, my boyfriend had the jackfruit crunch wrap and he loved it. The pesto they have here is so delicious and you can build your own salad which is so awesome all the toppings you want and a very fair price the owner is such an amazing and kind hearted person Corona is lucky to have Organic Junkie I’m forsure a junkie and recommend this place to all my friends and family.<//Review>< pictures>

Wish they gave a heads up about the extra $8 delivery charge instead of it catching you off guard. Also very disappointing the name doesn’t match the ingredients, they admit only a small % of their food is actually organic</Review>

<Review>Super excited to have a vegan restaurant so close to home.  Food is amazing, staff is helpful and atmosphere is inviting. They do have a secret menu, you can check out more on their Instagram page. I had the pizza panini which was soooo good, hearty and filling. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a healthy meal. I will definitely be back!<//Review>< Pictures>

First time going to this place.  We tried a few times but it wasn't open yet at the time.  We had breakfast and I chose the sweet panini sandwich and the salad.  The drinks were delicious.  They gave us samples and decided on the Pitaya Pineapple fresca.  The Lavender was very tasty, too.  This is in an apartment and shops complex near the Main Street train station in Corona.  You can walk to the station from here.  There are new restaurants just opened and more coming soon.  Service was friendly and highly recommend you try it.  Everything is organic, too!  Minimalist decor, I like it.<//review>

This place is wonderful! I have been there twice and James cut my hair both the times. This time I got a shorter style, and James did a great job. I have always been scared of cutting my locks but I feel so happy after having done it. I will be going again :) Great job, guys!<//text>

I got to work with James who was such a sweetheart! He washed and treated my hair with fantastic product, then proceeded to cut my hair wet and then again dry. My hair is really curly and I wanted a short cut, which was really new for me. James made me feel really comfortable while maintaining a professional attitude. It was so great to see the finished product!

Thank you!!</review>

I recently had a much needed haircut at Salon 1322. James did a great job of creating a fun look that suited me perfectly. He listened carefully to the wishlist that I had for a style and took his time to make sure that I was happy with the result.
The owner, Deb, has gone above and beyond to have all the necessary safety precautions and procedures in place. It is a lovely space to be pampered and have your hair cut and styled.<//text>

Update: I have come back twice since my initial review and my 5 star review still stands. Jackie is absolutely amazing.

I have never had my hair professionally colored before. I've been cutting and box-dying my hair myself for over a decade. That being said, I couldn't find the time to color my hair in about a year and a half; so my roots had a year and a half worth of growth. I knew that if I dyed it myself, I would have a very obvious "band" going around my head that would ultimately make me look like rings on the trunk of a tree.
I had job interviews coming up and I really needed to look my best. Jackie did amazing work, and even several weeks later I'm still getting compliments on my cut, color, and highlight. I don't know exactly what she used, but my hair has never felt healthier. I have an appointment to color/highlight my roots on a few weeks; there's NO way I'm going back to box dye after the amazing magic Jackie did. This is a higher end salon, you get what you pay for. I'm happy to be a repeat client!</review>

I've been coming here for years and honestly I no longer trust anyone else except Katie with my hair.

They have really stepped up to the plate during COVID. Everyone wears a mask the entire time. I didn't see any of that "let me rest my mask on my chin, or let my nose peek out" silliness from any of the staff or the guests. You check in outside and they read your temperature. Once you're inside, there's lots of room so you're always distanced from other guests. Everything is kept super clean. They also have an outdoor patio for even more room. The entire experience feels very safe for both you and the staff. It does not feel exploitative in any way. This has been really important to me as I evaluate what businesses to visit during this time - I never want to put anyone working at risk.

Yes, it is going to be more expensive than other salons, but it's a high end salon with quality to match. In this case you do get what you pay for and it's very worth it. Everyone there works extremely hard and is very skilled from what I've seen.

I highly recommend this place. Thank you Salon 1322 for giving me a bright spot to feel pampered (in a safe way) during this crazy time!< /Text>

<Review>Deb was amazing. She transformed my long lifeless hair into a cute bob.  Having moved from the east coast to the west coast, this was my first haircut of 2020, and I couldn't have been happier. They are following social distancing protocols and have a patio available for outdoor hair cuts. I definitely will be back 🥰< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

I had been putting off getting my hair done for awhile because I was nervous about COVID. But I wanted to get a cut and style before my engagement photos, and decided to try Salon 1322 for the first time. I felt completely at ease from the moment I arrived at the salon. The check-in process was very safe, and they are adamant about limiting the amount of people inside the salon. After checking in on the iPad outside of the salon, Deb came to take my temperature and bring me to my chair. Staff members wore their masks at all times, and I never came in close contact with anyone besides my stylist. The salon was very clean and I was seated far away from any other customers. I washed my hair before my appointment, something they recommend to limit your time in the salon (this is totally optional though, if you like getting your hair washed at a salon you still can). I got a beautiful cut and curl, and felt totally safe the entire time. I really appreciate businesses that put their customers' health first. Salon 1322 will definitely be my new regular hair place!< /review>

After many years of knowing that Salon 1322 is a gem of a salon, I’m finally writing a long overdue review.

Deb Clendening, the owner goes above and beyond to ensure each client receives the best experience, from personalized consultations to on trend cuts and color. Each member of this talented team cares enough to continually hone their skills by attending workshops and classes to not only stay current, but to keep the clients’ locks healthy and vibrant.

This past Saturday, I had the extreme pleasure of Deb for my color, and James for my style.
Both Deb and James greeted me promptly, consulted with me on what color choices would be a fantastic Fall look, and I received the absolutely most perfect blow dry and style from James. James is a brilliant addition to this special place!
I left feeling like a rockstar, with bouncy, gleaming hair, and have already received a multitude of compliments!!!

Make Salon 1322 your salon- you and your hair deserve the best!!<//Review>

Salon 1322 is a fabulous salon and Gina Loukas is a talented, amazing stylist.  I have trusted Gina with coloring and cutting my hair for well over 20 years (18 years of which have been at 1322).  Every time I see her we come up with something a little new and different to do with my hair to keep it fresh and current.  I honestly can’t say enough about the trust and friendship I’ve developed with her over the years.  Gina and the other stylists are always implementing the latest techniques in color, cuts and styling and I always leave there feeling a little more chic and bouncy!

The salon itself is so well designed, creative and beautiful.  The space and furnishings are warm and inviting and there are always fun little whimsical touches to the décor.  Salon 1322 has gone above and beyond with COVID protocols for the safety of all.  As another client noted, temperatures are taken before entering; clients wait outside until their stylist is ready for them; masks are worn by all; disposable capes are used and clients are all at least ten feet apart from each other.  In addition, Salon 1322 has also created a great outdoor salon area that also adheres to all COVID protocols, for those times when indoor services are not allowed.  I feel extremely safe at Salon 1322 and would not hesitate to book appointments there during these unsettling times.<//review>

<Review>Salon 1322 happens to be the only place where I've cut my hair since moving from Atlanta three years ago. It was certainly a gamble, because I'm an extremely picky person with my hair. I have thin hair that's always been cut short to try and give the illusion of some fullness. The most wonderful Cherise advised me to cut my hair in a very subtle angled bob and I never looked back. Every four months I would come to update my cut and I was so so pleased. Enter 2020 and it's absolute caca storm. Cherise moved away leaving me without a stylist (TEARS) and then Covid hit one month later. I temporarily lived in Miami with family for six months hiding from the virus, and upon returning I took a blind swing with another lovely stylist (Deb) here at Salon 1322. On a whim I asked her to cut my hair with long layers. I mean, it's 2020 after all and it's time to try new things! She cut my hair beautifully and mentioned it was very non-committal style, as I could do a quick chop back into a bob the next go 'round if I didn't like it.

I want to talk about the safety precautions they're taking in this Covid life we're enduring. Your temperature is taken before even entering, and you wait outside until the stylist is fully ready for you. Upon entering, you are wearing a mask, the stylist is wearing a mask, and the robe they put on you is new and disposable. You are at least 10 feet away from other customers and the capacity I believe is at 25%. I felt extremely safe and super happy upon leaving. Let us support small business, and look very cute in the process. Thanks, Deb!</Review>< Pictures>

I followed Stephanie from her old salon in noe valley to 1322 in Belmont. I am SO glad I did. The salon is clean, beautiful, and professional. Stephanie is my girl. She does a great haircut and knows what she is doing. I come with photos and ideas from styled IG pics and she is honest with me about what will work with the texture of my hair & the reality of my life chasing kids. She is also the master of balayage and color that looks great for months. The salon was a wonderful surprise. Everyone was adequately spaced out and masked. They took my temperature upon entering and had me fill out/sign consent & contact tracing agreement. Throughout my appointment things were cleaned and sanitized. And coming from SF - parking was a breeze. I 100% recommend this salon and of course, do yourself a favor & get your hair done by Stephanie :)<//review>

I went into the salon in hopes to tone my hair darker. The salon was very aesthetically pleasing and the stylist were all very nice. They had complimentary refreshments and snacks. I love the end product of my hair and highly recommend this place. My stylist was Brandi. I would give her better than an A+ 10/10 if I could. Loved my experience here.</Review>

<review>Brandi is an amazing stylist. I had box bleached my hair a few years back and she has helped me completely restore it and make it look amazing. When I came into the salon I was welcomed immediately. The salon was very well maintained, fun, and just an overall great vibe. They offer drinks and snacks while you wait.
I sent Brandi what I wanted to do and we discussed the best way to do it. She gave me her professional opinion on what would work best with my hair tone and cut. She gave me exactly what I wanted!! After she was done she explained to me what products to use to keep my hair healthy.
I can't thank her enough for all the help.< /review>< pictures>

Brandi is the best hair stylist I’ve ever had!!
She’s sweet, she works hard, and she’s constantly seeking out new ways to educate herself and be the best that she can be.
I sent her an idea I had for my hair and she was real with me about the damage it would cause and how expensive it would be to upkeep. She’s very honest and cares about her clients. At the end of the day she was able to give me a look that I totally loved, and my hair is still healthy as can be! I can always count on her to make my hair beautiful AND healthy.
The salon is clean, comfortable, and cute. I was offered water and snacks when I came in. Throughout my appointment Brandi gave me tips on how to take care of my hair afterward. 5/5 experience!!< /text>

<Rate>5< /Rate><text>High quality service. Men can get a wash, scalp massage, cut, rinse and hot towel for $50. When they do the stylists are able to expertly work with your hair and one or two photos to give you an excellent cut. This is one of the best places I’ve been to on either coast and I recommend it to anyone traveling to the Bay Area for work.< /text>< Pics>

I'm always looking for a good haircut, one that is reasonably priced from someone who is personable and understands my hair.  I am consistently delighted by my haircut at Salon 1322 from Cherise who remembers me and is able to help me with my sometimes unruly hair.  She's very friendly and is an expert with curly hair and knows many styles.  Parking is convenient on street and the complementary beverages refreshing.  I'd highly recommend Salon 1322 and Cherise in particular.< /text>

Two words— Brandi Fessler!
At one point, my hair was 3 (three) different colors, all at different fading points. I went to Brandi with this concern, and she knew exactly what to do to fix my hair! The color came out so beautiful, closest I’ve ever seen it to my natural (Redhead) and all of the discoloration was gone. Best yet—- when the color faded, it was all even! So even now, 7 months after our appointment, the color has faded and my hair looks naturally beautiful.
5/5 recommend Brandi if you visit Salon 1322!</text><GmapID>0x808f9f6a8415a1fb:0x634cc999691c13bc</GmapID><rate>5</rate><Date>1569018486968< /Date>< pics>

I've been going to this Salon for 15 + years.  Everyone in the salon has incredible knowledge and expertise with color and highlights, haircuts, you name it. They continually update their skills and are always on the cutting edge of new products and styles.  Genevieve is my stylist and she is so much more than that to me.  She is a trusted professional and amazing friend.</Review>

Chante revived my gross looking hair and turned it platinum in one session! I very rarely go to the salon, but after this visit it's now a must. I'm in love! Thank you guys so much!! PS, i do recommend if you come to the salon in the afternoon that you try to get dropped off! Parking was a little difficult!< /Text>

I've been a client of Deborah for twenty years...maybe longer.  She runs a great salon with many folks like me that have been clients for years.  Although my style has changed little, Deborah keeps up on the trends and is always doing something different experimenting with her own hair and looks.  There's not a appointment that goes by where she doesn't have some new style/cut she's trying out.</Review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>Why in the world would anyone want to get their hair cut, colored, or styled by any other than the fabulous ladies at Salon 1322. They are the masters of Coif. My hair guru is Jackie and my son's hair guru is Cherise. Both are terrific. I have been to this salon numerous times to buy hair products (i.e.Shu Uemera and Kerastase ) that they offer too. The service is exceptional and the ambiance is heavenly; including great coffee, tea, Oreos, and trail mix.< /review>< user_name>

<Review>I am beyond thrilled, because after years of salon-hopping, searching for that certain 'Je ne sais quoi' - I finally found it!

I got my hair cut by Debbie, and she was beyond considerate when working on my hair. I was chopping off my long hair into a long bob, and also doing a tinted gloss (which was new to me). She took the time to understand what my preferences were, how I deal with my hair, as well as the natural tendencies for my hair type. She gave me some great tips along the way to deal with my hair. Beyond her professional expertise, she was incredibly pleasant to chat with, it felt totally natural and effortless.

A thing I particularly liked about this salon is how collaborative it felt. Everyone seemed to work together, give ideas or suggestions, and help out.

And, to conclude, I am in love with my haircut and gloss, and will certainly be back. The great hunt for the magical hairstylist is over, hoorah!</Review>< pictures>

Been getting a haircut from Adrianna for almost 2 years now - was bummed when she moved from San Carlos to Burlingame since I had to drive further, however, it's worth it - she's part owner and the salon is very well managed.< /review>

I dislike the fact that the females that work here lock the doors way before they actually close. As for today I arrive at 8:39pm and it was locked already they were in there and didn't want to help me when they actually close at 9:00pm. Like really, almost 25 to 30 minutes to clean this place when it is not that big. This place needs new people honestly.<//Text>

El lugar es llamativo pero los precios son demasiado altos 65 centavos por una champurrada wow por unos cuantos panitos gaste 5 dollares, y lo digo porque en otras panaderias Guatemaltecas el precio es justo
Nunca masire ahi
Place is fancy but the prices are just aweful 65 cents for a small cookie like bread "champurrada" i spent 5 dollars for a few breads in comparison to other similar bakeries where you get more for your moneys worth, i am not a  cheap person but not dumb either</text>

It was longer than 2 weeks ago when I was in that restaurant and I didn't really like it. The staff were discriminative and the food wasn't that good but that's my opinion.  I have a post office box in the same lot that's probably where I was instead of the restaurant.<//review>

(Translated by Google) It is a place where they serve chapina food but not original.For example, the pepian is served only with the message and rice without any vegetables and chicken with skin. For me I think that 3 stars is a lot of qualification but the bread does closely resemble the original chapin bread and its prices per plate do not fall below 12 dollars

(Original)
Es un lugar donde sirven comida chapina pero no original.por ejemplo el pepian lo sirven solo con el recado y arroz sin ningun tipo de vegetales y el pollo con pellejo. Para mi creo que 3 estrellas es mucha calificacion pero el pan si se asemeja mucho al pan original chapin y sus precios por plato no bajan de 12 dolares</text>

<review>(Translated by Google) Visit this place a few days ago in Figueroa st. and I liked it, for the lunch time and the Pepian was very rich, take butter bread, toast and flan which by the way was also very rich, and the place is very clean and nice.
Nice and clean place, I got the Guatemalan dish Pepian and it was delicious, I bought bread, and flan (was really good), I like this place, coming back soon for shortbread and champurradas maybe there cheaper in other places but this champurradas are the best, by the way the price is 0.55 cents not 0.65.

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>Parking is easy to find. It's rarely ever too crowded. The selection is nice. Place is always neat and clean. Many items are the bulk-savings kind but without a membership fee. Good selection of alcohol. The sodas are rarely on sale though. Overall, this is a great place for groceries.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

This is actually a really good supermarket. The parking is easy. The staff is friendly and helpful. They have a good selection that get's restocked frequently. I've actually always had a good experience shopping here and I consider it my great little local market.</Review>

Update: After months of shopping here I've been really disappointed by the fact they advertise meat prices but never seem to have any.  The staff isn't very helpful either and I've decided not to shop here anymore. I would recommend the Ralphs on 4th.

I found some things to be a good price here and others to be over priced. The produce did seem fresh and looked great. Meat selection had some good variety for beef with some really large cuts that would be good for a meat smoker but expensive. I'm probably just going to come here when things are on sale for what I need. As far as the staff goes, I kind of found them to be unprofessional. The check out clerk was talking to the bagger about how drunk they got the night before. I'm not necessarily going to hold that against the store but employees should use some smarts when around customers.< /review>

So today I was at Smart & Final and I was not happy with my service Ima disable vet I go in there they have one cashier open then I look and there's another 1 and then when I go behind them they tell me there not open so I get back in the line that's long and then I look over and he opens up the line the brother opens # 3 and all the people behind me go first and I still have to wait on 5 which is slow...that wasn't cool for him to over look me ..Im on a cane.</Review>

Great prices and solid brands. I stopped in for some items for work but noticed they had some things I normally get at Whole Foods and ended up shopping for myself too. It was surprisingly organized for being so close to the holidays.</Text>

<Name>David Nagel< /Name><review>Smart and Final is great for a lot of things, especially cheap stock pots (5 quart for around $10), really great and affordable cheese (the giant bag of blue cheese costs less than most store's tiny blue cheese containers) and creamer ($5.99 for the big International Delights Cold Stone flavor). Unlike most stores in South Long Beach, this is a regular - sized Smart and Final Extra. It has everything any other SFE would have. And it has a large parking lot and a really tasty Mediterranean restaurant next door (Alibaba, which Google Maps can't understand via spoken commands for whatever reason lol). So you can order food then shop then pick up your food. The produce is OK, better than, say, Target, but worse than Trader Joe's or Sprouts. The liquor selection is weak. Lots of frozen bulk foods. SFE is more expensive than Costco and has less selection, but it's also more consistent. You can generally count on something being there when you need it.< /review>< Pictures>

I know this store well and have found that they fail to stock the store at night.  They only stock during the day.  The people in the store are nice that's why I give it 2 stars but their ordering system and stocking shifts fail because the company fails not the people that work here.< /review>< response>

<review>The long LINE (THERE IS ONE LINE) is not something anyone wants to tackle. There were 2, maybe three registers open.  Not sure why I ever came for just two items.  I don't understand how this store is helping shoppers.</review></record>

I love smart and final! All they are missing is almond breeze cashew milk and non-dairy halo top! Other than that, they have a great vegan selection and are so close to home. Love it!<//Text>

<review>Helpful staff and for bulk items they are very reasonable but for many items the chains like Stater's beat them easily. Yesterday I went and picked up my favorite store cookies, Frederico's Gourmet Italian Cookies. So many different spices and flavors. Give them a try. I've only found them here year round.</review>< userid>

I used to never shop in Smart & Final did not had a pleasant shopping experience until this one! It has good fresh vegetables amazing to stock up food in large quantity, store is well organized. Store is not too big, it is perfect size to get on the bottom of your shopping list fast.<//Review>

However e did find out that we had to go where they actually had a butcher. However they did have really great fruit and vegetables. And a lot of other things that I don't see in other store's.<//review><userid>114409830045128140670< /userid><Pics>None<//Pics><user_name>Patricia Lester<//user_name>< Response>

<review>Conveniently close to home. Good prices on most grocery products but pricy on certain items. Meats, cheeses, bread and veggies can be found cheaper elsewhere. Many options of products here. Fish is limited and crab, lobster and things of that nature come only once a year... Very clean. Parking spaces are a tight squeeze. Bigger spots found on the side by the laundromat (along the wall). overall, I'm happy with buying my groceries here. Better than the Albertson's-then Top Value-that it was before. WAY BETTER!!!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<Review>OMG this was one of my best experiences with a hairstylist! I had the pleasure of working with Zach who took me on my journey from long hair to short hair. He was very helpful in helping me figure out what I want, explaining how to take care of my curly/wavy hair, and making me feel very comfortable with him. We laughed SO MUCH! I even told him about my previous experience with a hair dresser who had burned my scalp a little because they put the hairdryer on for too long, and he immediately told me that I should always let my hairdresser know if it's getting too hot. All in all my experience was 21/10 because of Zach and his genius work with my curls! Thank you! <3< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN7XDGXiD_XYh82bF6YmwZz5RcCQqrSArLnQrYu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMM4aZkjMsJ0jhwqp1NxMLftuWPv4wSI12O9Bxe=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<review>Many thanks to my stylist Eddie O. @ Salon Jarick!  It's a very classy & clean salon AND Eddie has impeccable training & skills.  He is always professional, knowledgable, flexible, AND affordable.  Not to mention, very focused & patient with my long & naughty hair... Most importantly he makes me look beautiful before I leave the salon!!!< /review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOgLGQmlwHVzVzKnb6mjkdK2Fo5JTqXxIZSJJGA=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><response>None</response>< gmapID>

Visited for the first time and was booked with Zac and he was amazing with my curly thick hair. It had been a very long time since my last cut and he put in so much work and attention into making it light, bouncy, and giving me really well blended highlights. A plus is he walked me through tips for keeping my curls/waves defined. so so happy with my hair, great experience</Text>

He asked questions, gave recommendations and I am very happy with his work.

The salon was clean with limited occupancy and is in a great central location with private parking. I recommend this place.

Thanks again, Zac!<//text>< Pictures>

It was a gloomy day that I thought of treating myself. I saw this hair salon nearby that was offering an excellent service. I heard good feedback about their service, and I was glad that it was truly right. From their customer service up to their hairstylist, they were all very friendly and accommodating. I am very happy with the overall service they had rendered. I loved my new hair!<//text>

<text>Make sure to book your appointment with Zac if you have curly or wavy hair!  He is so skilled at what he does and I always enjoy watching him transform my hair! He has taught me how to keep my waves and curls frizz-free, and he always takes his time when I go in for a cut. Thank you, Zac!< /text>< Name>

Have no idea who to go with? Want someone to give you an honest opinion of what's going to look good or not? Want someone who double and triple checks that you both are on the same page about what's about to go down with your hair? Want someone who ACTUALLY KNOWS HOW TO CUT CURLY HAIR? Zac is your man! He's patient, has passion and is so attentive! He used to work in Redlands before working in Palm Springs and let me tell you, as Marvin Gaye once said "there ain't no mountain high enough,
Ain't no valley low enough,
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you". I had no hesitation setting up an appointment Fernando hearing he moved locations. That hair cut 10/10 worth the drive and worth a try. If you want to take a chance, ask for Zac 😉<//text>

AWESOME Beauty shop in the area! I will definitely be back here again because you made me very happy when you did a haircut on me last Friday afternoon. I also observed that the place was very cleaned and well-organized. Expect me to call and use your Beauty shop again and again. A high rating and a strong recommendation for you!<//Review>

<Review>I visited this salon for the first time yesterday.  Everyone was taking precautions as necessary during the pandemic but the atmosphere was still friendly.
My favorite stylist from Redlands recently moved here and I followed him because he is the ONLY person who can deal with my curly hair.  I didn’t need to worry about it for the three months of lock-down as his cuts still look great months afterwards.  He really pays attention to how each curl lays.  He has an abundance of positive energy too.
The salon is great, but Zac is the best!</Review>< pics>

<text>We love Zac! We were so sad to hear he was leaving the salon we’ve gone to for years in Redlands but were more than happy to make the drive out to Palm Springs to have him do all three teenage boys’ hair. Zac is such a professional, listens well to his clients and is an artist, working with each person’s individual hair type and style wishes.  He is easy to talk to and gives great tips and advice.

After several months of sheltering at home, I was so excited to go to Salon Jarick and have Galen McKinzie highlight and cut my hair. The color is beautiful! Thank you Galen for my new hairdo!< /review>

I had an appointment with the absolute best hairstylist ever. Angelika turned me into a whole new person! I’m obsessed with how talented she is. My hair was just not looking cute the color was brassy and I didn’t want to do anything with it and now I’m styling it all the time. I’ve had so many compliments and I’m so happy!!  I will definitely recommend her to everyone.</review>

New hairstylist Zac did such an amazing job on my hair! I have curly hair & I have never trusted anyone with my hair the way I trust Zac. It always turns out looking flawless, my curls are always happy after seeing him!
Zac cuts and dyes my moms curly hair as well & she is always super happy with the results, he’s an amazing colorist as well!</text>

I was very hesitant to changing my stylist, but after a trusted friend insisted I try Eddie, I gave in.  I am so glad I did.  My hair was in desperate need of serious attention as I was long overdue for a highlight and cut. Eddie listened to what I wanted, made suggestions, and made it happen. The salon had an awesome retro Palm Springs vibe.  Everyone was inviting and friendly.  I’m excited for  my next appointment.<//Text>

My daughter was very nervous going into this. Dr. Dunn’s staff made her feel right at home and didn’t rush with the details. So happy we found them.
Hugo has also been an amazing help to me with insurance and appointments. Thank you to all the staff!<//Review>

The Absolute best!! The best service, patient care, professionalism, honest care for the patient. I’ve never been to a place where they continuously call you to remind you about your appointment. They continuously call you to ask and see if your teeth are good, if the Invisalign is properly working, they are actually ALWAYS THERE for the patient. I’d recommend them to anyone !!< /text>

< Review>
My daughter was referred to Dr Dunn. He examined her teeth and recommended expanders after explaining to me the problem. Installment payment options are available, a discount is given when paid in full. My other two daughters previously got their braces from Dr Dunn, too. A discount is also given for siblings getting their braces on the same day. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, facility is clean, and service is fast and efficient. We recommend Dr Dunn for your orthodontic needs. My girls are happy patients. And thanks to Dr Dunn, my daughter's won't just be biting correctly, they would also have the best smiles when they complete they orthodontic therapies!< /Review>

<Review>Dr. Dunn and his team are really sweet and professional with their patients. Dr. Dunn is very thorough and pays attention to every little detail. He takes pride in his work and watches/manages the progress of getting to the perfect smile. We are really happy with the result and would definitely recommend him.< /Review>< Pics>

Dr. Dunn and his staff are one of a kind. I had my first experience with them over 14 years ago and have recently gone back to them for additional services. The entire staff is friendly and welcoming and you feel truly welcome every time you walk in the door. I would recommend Dr. Dunn and his staff to anyone looking for quality service and pricing!<//text>

<Review>My daughter had her braces done by Dr. Dunn and he's terrific! They made her feel comfortable and the process was very easy. The staff is extremely friendly and they really go above and beyond to make every visit personable. When I decided to get Invisalign for myself, I went straight to Dr. Dunn knowing I would be getting the best care in town!</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Dr. Dunn and his staff have made braces easy and reasonable, not the nightmare it was when I was a kid.  My son is having great results with Invasalign and we hope to get our daughter started soon.  We have three kids that need braces and we expect great results from Dr. Dunn for all three.<//text>

Few days later bought some chicken feet for my dog and they were definitely bad. The smell made me want to vomit. I will no longer get my meat here.
I called and complained but nothing...< /Text>< Gmap_id>

<Review>I don't do major shopping here, but in a pinch it's great and very near my home. The lines are long and slow at times but the produce usually makes up for it in quality and price. They also have a small kitchen and bakery and we enjoy that as well. The meat counter is also nice with butchers on site.</Review>< pics>

Pricing very high for the area that is depressed economically. Business is brisk and selection is okay. Pork chops seemed chewy in nature and rather pricey considering the strange almost frozen texture of the product.<//review>

Its a nice hometown market. Prices are fair. Place is clean and well stocked. I will return. Most of the "Super" markets like Superior and El Supra are very poorly managed. Over 20 people in 3 lines--they never consider openning another line. I have no problem abandoning the cart and going elsewhere. Rio Rancho has never had that problem.<//text>

Fresh fruit and vegetables always at low cost. Love their bakery, they make awesome desserts and cakes. Meat can be a little pricey but if you shop when you get there weekly flyers during their sales it’s pretty worth it.<//text>

Good little Mexican sore, it's got a butcher with good meat and seafood. And my sons favorite part is the littke bakery.

This is a small branch of the Rio rancho grocers chain.   It is a typical Mexican grocery store with great produce a  wide selection of central and South American foods and goods.... I have to say, the homeless problem in this area spills into the parking lot at night and, unfortunately the aroma of their lives is present walking into this store... I have a strong stomach, and even I whimpered and covered my nose when I was greeted by the smell of ammonia walking out of this store.... My hats off to those who brave the same on their way in and out of the place where they buy their food...</Text>

A friend of mine grilled some meat and I liked the way it was marinated, he told me about this place, I was surprised by the low price on meat here, I'm used to shopping at Staters. It was on sale but even the regular price seemed cheaper. Will definitely come back for more whenever I grilled, marinated chicken was $1 a pound, and it came out delicious.< /review>

It's very old, small, unclean, in a bad area. Just needed sodas and they were very expensive. I don't know how is this hideous place still open?</Review>

This is a newly remade market that just opened. Prices are good and everyone is friendly and courteous. The store is clean and well stocked but it is not your big market it's more like your local neighborhood market smaller and friendlier.</Text>

In  this store which I  visit the Metropcs area to accomodate my phone business and have never gone without a smile from the handlers performing their jobs very professionally and informatively . I give a Mr. BAM , MR . DAOUD and a Ms Edith praise in performances. ! Do look them up if you visit also a wonderful and fresh environment  to shop there .I dance quite often the outside I am a performer ...< /review>

<rating>1< /rating><text>Be careful!!!! When you get anything from the meat section be very careful to watch the people helping you. They tend not to change their gloves after handling chicken. Also good luck getting any help from them. Stood their trying to get help for at least 10 minutes. As usual i walk up and greet whoever is behind the counter... "buenas tardes" what you get back a blank stare. I thought hmmm maybe they are just busy. So i waited another 5 or so minutes. Looked like they didnt want to help anyone and did everything possible not to see you. Fk this place</text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

The only reason they even got a 2 star rating was because of the location. The employees there are bitter, dull, lifeless... No smiles, no greetings, no quality customer service in my opinion.<//Text>

This store is not all that the store needs to upgrade not only in their software but they need an upgrade in their meat department they have bad customer service even though I worked there for only a month I do not like the customer service if they have at the meat department they treat you like if you're not a customer you they live by the customer they work for the customer other than that why even work any grocery store<//text>
