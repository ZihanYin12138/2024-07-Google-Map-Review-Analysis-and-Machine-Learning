<text>If I could give a 0 I would. I'm letting everyone know out there, DO NOT put your stuff in this storage. My Storage was broken into and they took my fridge, washer, dryer, mirror, bar stools, vacuum, 65 inch tv, 55 inch tv, boxes of clothes. I believe someone on the inside was involved. The person who broke into my storage, replaced the lock with another lock that looks like public storage and slapped a public storage sticker on it. Not suspicious at all? Yeah right. And it just so happens some of my stuff was in another storage. I have gotten police involved but they aren't doing much, public storage is not doing much. I have to rely on the insurance to try to help me out. I am seeking legal advise to have Public Storage reliable at some extent. It was a mess and I would never ever recommend this place again. Be Aware!! My storage was organized and filled to the rim. You can see boxes were torn and items were tossed around. Please everyone, do not store your belongings here!< /text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMEhlaz9OgApi3NIP98Q7Waoz8nYRBM1n9MF5tj=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNrYPM5lY016-kZx0mkOb2qAB7rFytugbskLlHD=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Response>

< review>
My experience here at Public Storage was the most stress free and it was thanks to Jessica! This was my first time ever moving into a storage and while I was a little worried, Jessica ensured that she covered everything with us and made it an overall pleasant moving time. I highly recommend doing business here because you will get professional help and quickly.<//review>

<Review>Would give no star if that was an option. My fiance has been storing his stuff here since August 2020 (the height of covid). Today we drove an hour to pick up some items from the storage unit and his code would not open the gate. We called the customer service number. Apparently they have decreased the access hours since we last were here a few months ago. They did not notify us. We have now wasted our entire evening and we really needed the access today.The new hours are also extremely limited and do not work for people like us working a 9-5 job. It is not what we agreed to
in our contract. The customer service guy was very rude and unhelpful. I'm very frustrated, very angry, and just wanted to get my stuff.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c335c6149656cb:0x33545f5831029396</Gmap_id><UserId.>110161942087701967769</UserId.>< Pics>

<review>I dont know who this owner is but I do know one thing about him,he scared!
He only answers to people who leave 4 or 5 stars and leave good reviews.if you leave a bad review you dont here from him at all.this is what everyone should do if you care about your stuff.install motion cameras that alert your cell phone,they do exist and are battery operated.then you will find out who is steeling your stuff< /review>< pictures>

<Text>Needed a place to store our beloved home items. My fiancé and I just passed by the Public Storage on Hermosa, Rancho Cucamonga thinking that it would be too expensive or that the units were sold out due to previous searches.

Our luck got better! 1st off, the staff who assisted us, Jennifer, was super informative and friendly! Excellent customer service right off the bat!

After a little consultation with Jennifer, we concluded we needed 3 rooms full of space. We got a 10x10, Jennifer mentioned the storage space was also 9 feet high so we could Tetris stuff up if we had to. Jennifer gave us such a wonderful deal for our storage problem and it really made our day! They have everything you need there to protect your fragile valuables too and covering for your bedding / couches. We got some and Jennifer included these items in our deal!

Super thankful we found this Public Storage Facility! It’s a nice place to store your needs short or long term (I say this because there was a regular that came after us and he said Jennifer was the best, and Jennifer greeted this customer very fondly).

Highly recommend!< /Text><gmapID>0x80c335c6149656cb:0x33545f5831029396</gmapID><pictures>None< /pictures><rating>5</rating><resp>None<//resp></record></dataset><record>

<text>This establishment has the best customer service and it’s extremely reliable with any questions that I had about company policies. Both showing hospitality and friendliness I would reference friends and family for secure storage. Public Storage stands by their reliability and secure storage. Definitely a place worth considering for storage needs.

The person that helped me was a young lady named Naomi. Both polite and courteous.<//text>< userid>

Been renting storage here for a lil over a year , and it’s the best storage facility in Rancho Cucamonga. And mostly all due to the fact that management is awsome ! Jessica the manager is a true professional at her job . Not to mention  kind, sweet ,and most helpful . Since day one ! And it doesn’t stop there Summer is another associate that is top notch and very professional. I will always bring my business here . And recommend to others .👍🏽👍🏽</Text>

Jessica
WAS amazing!! So friendly, courteous and answered all our questions. She helped us upgrade and even came down to make sure everything was up to our standards. We would’ve rent from her no matter what!!
THANKS Jessica for helping our move go smoother

<review>My husband rented here we have a service animal they wanted us to put our service animal in our car when temperatures were over 100 degrees outside and hotter in a car . It only got worse our unit was burglarized a night when the manager and my husband had words over our service animal. He came the next morning and opened the unit and saw our stuff was stolen multiple items he went to office they were not apologetic just told him to call their insurance our 15 yr old was depressed all his belongings were part of the stolen items and chose to sit by himself manager went and told him off never coming to us and knowing he was ours very unprofessional and unsympathetic they also allow people to sleep in their units dont rent here if u value your belongings they also do illegal lock outs<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

We came in to rent a unit for my son and she didnt even acknowledge us for a good 5 minutes because she was on her phone and when she did decide to grace us with her attention she kept using her phone through out the whole process and forced us to get insurance even though we had insurance  that covered us.

Came in for my appointment a lady in the office by the name of April would not allow me to rent a space unless I purchased a lock, and was even rude about it!

<Review>Estephanie and April are always very sweet, I have been coming here for years and created an account just so I could commend these girls on the great job they are doing. Everytime I come down to pay for my daughter's storage unit they always greet me with smiling faces and listen to my stories. I appreciate the hard work they put into cleaning around the storage units and whenever I need something they are always here to help me out. Thank you girls.</Review>< Pics>

Estephanie and April are always very sweet, I have been coming here for years and created an account just so I could commend these girls on the great job they are doing. Everytime I come down to pay for my daughter's storage unit they always greet me with smiling faces and listen to my stories. I appreciate the hard work they put into cleaning around the storage units and whenever I need something they are always here to help me out. Thank you girls.</Text>

I had stored my belongings at other storage places before and always hated the customer service I received.  Thank you public storage and April for changing that. April was so helpful and knowledgeable. Thanks for making everything such an easy experience.</Text>

Drove 30 mins from my place to this branch of public storage as they said I can only get a storage unit for foreign ID if I drop by. When I got to this place they refused me instantly. I asked why did jessica told me I can get a unit in the first place? They just said she doesn’t know the policy and I’m on my own. Well thank you for wasting my gas and my precious time. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this storage space. People here don’t seem to know what they’re talking about and will only cost you more money and waste your time. Imagine if you have people paid by the hour to transfer your stuffs and they’ll just refuse you. That would cost you more money. Very incompetent people.<//text>< pics>

Great Place! I was helped by Heather she was very friendly she even helped me get into a smaller storage and saved me $20 a month. I have already moved all my stuff in and she was right the smaller storage was a perfect fit. The facility is very large and looked very well kept.< /Review>

Do to Summer & April’s great attention to detail & Awesome Customer Service, I definitely leased my storage, they made the whole process easy for me and my brother, they took the time to explain everything and gave us a tour, they didn’t make it feel like business they made it feel comfortable and welcoming and now a days it’s rare, so Summer and April deserve the 5 stars.<//review>

If you rent a space here and leave a little after hours they will call you saying next time we will evict you!!! I understand if it’s hours after it closed but if it’s only minutes 🤷🏽‍♂️. And they raised my rent after only 2 months there!!! I am trying to get a different storage place because public storage SUCKS!!!</Review>

<Review>Came in here the other day with my husband after searching numerous other storage companies, finally found this one. Not too far from the house, their prices were extremely competitive with the other places that i went to. They finally had the size i was looking for! The three ladies in the office were so nice and helpful, (don't remember any of there names, unfortunately). If you are in search of a storage go here! This place was HUGE, they have all sizes. Much cleaner in comparison to the other local competitors.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>Needed a storage ASAP I had to my mother in law out of her apartment in under 10 days. I spoke with Heather she was very nice and explained everything to me. When my husband went to move everything in we realized that the storage I had gotten was too small. Heather found us one that would fit all of moms items she really saved the day from being even more stressful than it already was.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>The staff is extremely helpful and polite. Estephanie escorted me to the available units and suggested sizes based on my storage needs. She was very professional, personable, and wanted to make sure I was well-covered with supplies for my move. It was raining heavy during my visit but Estephanie did not hesitate in walking me to available units because I needed one that day.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures></record></dataset><record>

When I first signed up for this storage facility I reserved it online with a price of  $165. Once I went to pick up my keys the amount in their system was about $185 plus insurance. They said it would be fixed immediately and that did not happen. So for the 1st month I had an automatic payment set up and they overcharged me. Second month I paid the difference and confirmed with the workers there if that was ok. They confirmed. I think got a letter advising that my stuff would be auctioned off if I didn't pay in full. I call and tell them I paid my bill on time. They tell me again it's a mistake and it'll be taken care of. A few weeks and more late letters later a go to my storage to pick up luggage for an emergency trip I had and was unable to enter the property. The entry box said our code was denied. OF COURSE.  We go buy luggage and go on our trip. When we get back I call to complain. They give like a $15 credit. Not even enough to cover luggage. A few weeks later I receive a phone call stating that they cut off my locks. This was after my next payment. They apologize AGAIN and asked if I can come in and get my new keys. They cut my locks because their system showed that non of my payments were in full. Fast forward to today. I had already called several times because every time I went to make an online payment it showed $100 over my rent but there was no answer. I finally got a hold of someone today and asked them about the fees. She told me that her system didn't show that a they are now charging me a late fee. I advised her that those numbers must have just changed and she told me that it has been that way. Without arguing I asked for the late fee to be removed with all of the things that happened with my storage from the start and she told me NO. Customer service to me is big. When your customer accommodates you in all of your mess ups, then you accommodate them.</text>

Rude staff and Property manager is no help. Staff gives wrong information and loses records. Was a good place when It was Hermosa storage. Public storage sucks. Asked for a lock to be cut off and they have no record of request a month later. Lock not cut off yet.< /text>

This was the third public storage I had gone to. Honestly, the only reason I stayed was because the girls there were very curteous. Noemi or Naomi (something like that) and Estephanie were being very helpful and were able to provide information that the other 2 places couldn’t. It’s rare for me to write a review, but I believe the situation calls for it. Thanks again girls!< /Review>

Had storsge units for 30 years. Good experiences inril now. Raised rates 4 times in 2 years. The office staff and customer service line says its to keep up with maket value. Untrue. Each time rate increases,  I query the prices of the 10 miles surrounding. Rates of all (except public storage) are consistently $30-$80 a month less than Public Storage. Called customer service at public storage to ask questions, the cs rep was rude and sarcastic. He said, "we can charge what we want". I suggest renting from a different company.</Review>

I rented out a storage unit for my small business. A week after renting it they (Property Manager April) told me they need to move me to another unit because of an active electrical outlet in the unit. This is ridiculous, partly because they should have checked the unit before they rented it out and I've had this unit for over a week. I am closing my unit and going elsewhere. I wouldn't use this place if I were you.<//Review>

Outstanding people.
Dayanna and April are very good at their jobs.
I am a first time user of Public Storage and found this experience simple and easy to get thru.
April and Dayanne explained all the information I needed, walked me thru the documents needed.
Dayanne showed me the Units I would be renting.
Found this facility to be very neat, clean and organized.
Dayanne and April were very helpful in answering my many questions and completed the transactions even while assisting other customers.
Amazing place and great people, never missed a beat...

If your looking for a good Mexican food place with great flavor and taste. And your in Highgrove area stop by El silencito everything is cook fresh right there and then and service is fast. Like there special they got all week long too.  The cook is a cool and really nice guy too. My new favorite place to eat Mexican food.<//text>

Great food and it's not expensive. Their salt and pepper chicken it's addictive!! And if you call ahead they make a salt and pepper fish that my mom (and I) devour!! It doesn't look like much, but they know what they're doing.< /review>

<text>Great little spot to grab some Chinese food! Hands down favorite here is the salt & pepper chicken. I love that everything on the steam table stays fresh because it's they're always refilling it; it gets that busy. I only gave 4 stars because sometimes the staff is too busy to enforce covid 19 safety protocols and they only offer two sizes if you're buying a la carte, small or large.<//text><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPNt3diiOQwjtXb7LMRQO1tOLQRU0HRJu7x9F8m=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures>< Resp>

I'm going to compare this to PandaExpress for a reference point. The portions are enormous for the price. Panda definitely has more options compared to this place but if you enjoy the items here, you won't be missing much. Combo Express' noodles and fried rice are more flavorful and less oily. The noodles are the thicker variety though so if you prefer the thinner ones, you won't find that here. There are many chicken options (BBQ, fried, orange, etc.) but they are lacking choices in other proteins.

Bonus tip: If you know a friend that speaks Chinese, have them order for you. I don't think the portion will be larger (since they are so generous with everyone coming in) but they seem even nicer. You might get lucky and score a sauce packet or something... haha< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

They're fried smelt is also delicious. I usually get an order of that to pair as a side dish for when friends come over to drink.

The chowmien can be bland sometimes.</Text>< user_id>

Food is great tasting and fresh! The employees and owner are very sweet and warm. They actually greet you, remember your face and say thank you. It's not a production line where they wanna throw your food on a plate and get you out of there. This is my new spot!<//Review>

They lost a customer because she wouldn’t let me have ONE sweet sauce and I didn’t have 25 cents, I spent $15 and she couldn’t let me have a 25 cent sauce but yet she gave the other guy next to me two; was it because I’m Hispanic? That’s really messed up business.</Text>

<Text>I love this place! We order here for family parties over the years and today was my first time back since the quarantine...they hooked it up with the chicken with spicy salt & my favorite the honey walnut prawns! They were all so thoughtful and asked how I had been even though they probably get so many people a day. Thank you!</Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Just left there. I used to love this place; quality food, fair price. Not so now. The food is horrible. They have food markers on each dish but what you get is un-identifiable as human-grade food.
I threw the whole plate in the trash, afraid to even feed this 3rd world slop to my dogs.
NOT RECOMMENDED unless you dont care what you eat. I do not eat anything I cannot identify as is the case here. Not surprised if the 'chicken' is actually rat parts.
You have been warned !!< /Text>< pictures>

Have really stepped up their game to keep people away from the food during covid and everyone was wearing gloves masks and face Shields. I particularly like their fried fish.

The food here is great and the portions are huge. I am hooked on the salt and pepper chicken.  Its super crispy and the seasoning is fantastic.  The staff is really friendly and the service is great.  Anytime I'm near Vallejo I stop here to eat.
I highly recommend Combo Express and be sure to order the salt and pepper chicken, it's straight up grub!!!</review>

Best $8 EVER! Side can be 1 of chicken fried rice, chicken chow mein, or 1/2 and 1/2. It is buffet style with main choices of sweet and sour chicken or pork, broccoli beefb and spicey salted chicken (to name some main course choices). Absolutely a dinner saver for a great price on nights you don't feel like cooking. Also all the staff are welcoming and friendly, just like you are family.< /Text>

<review>(UPDATE AUG 2020)

This place is great! If you're hungry come here. Chow mein is kinda bland but the rest of the dishes are good and served quick and generous. BIG PORTIONS I'm talking about they're so kind to all the people! less than $10 for a huge plate of food. They're famous for their salt and pepper chicken, the garlic chicken is also really good. Hit them up for a quick stop express style.

-------------------------
Came here today for dinner / lunch around 5:30. Ladies in front of me were ordering a lot of food to go so I had to wait a few moments. Old guy with a marine jacket with a bit of a language barrier was kind of rude he was trying to see what food they had and was a little impatient so I just let him go ahead. I then got my food, half fried rice half chow mein spicy garlic chicken and the fried chicken with spicy salt. It was overall good not great, chow mein was blandish but doable with some soy sauce. Fried rice was good, same with the garlic chicken had a nice sauce. The fried chicken with spicy salt seems what a lot of people go for! It was fire no lie. Not bad for more of an authentic feeling vibe and definitely busy has its regular customers. Also the quantity they serve is pretty generous it's very filling I could barely finish the last few bites.<//review>< pictures>

This is probably the best place I had chinese food in the area. Classic chinese restaurant, with the take out box's, large portions, great price and friendly service. You can't beat it.</review>

<text>Wanted to get a plate of chow mein and fried chicken to go with some veggies I made the night before so I went to the bank and withdrew $40. Pretty sure I had only 2 $20 bills in my wallet and I gave them $20 for a $8 payment. The woman only gave me $1 and some change back but I had already walked out of the door before I noticed. I quickly picked up my son and ran back inside to say something. I noticed she had given me wrong change because I was going to give my son the money for his piggy bank but realized I was missing at least $10. The lady checked the receipt on the roll that receipt should have been in my hand. I didn’t want to argue so I said whatever it’s my fault but she insisted to take my phone number just to call me later saying they found no extra money. Won’t be going here ever again also telling my family not to eat there. I like their food but can’t support people who won’t trust a customer that’s been eating their food for years now. I may sound petty and irresponsible but times like this I need my $10!</text>< pics>

<Review>The service was friendly and I have low expectations for steam table type Chinese food, but honestly this was the worst Chinese food I’ve had. It wasn’t busy around dinner time when I went, but the hot table was out of pretty much everything except for rice, chow mein and garlic chicken so that’s what I got with a side of fried chicken.

The chow mein and rice were supposed to have chicken in them but I found none. The chow mein was mushy, weirdly orange, and tasted like the msg packet you get with ramen. The fried rice wasn’t fried rice, it was steamed rice that had been tossed with soy sauce for color but not enough for flavor, and it was mushy too. The garlic chicken was just bland. The fried chicken was surprisingly good in contrast, but seeing as it was an add on for the side, it didn’t redeem the meal.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

Well today 9/8/16 I ordered lunch special and also order six pot stickers I've been coming there for along time and spent a good amount of money but today I was question and called a liar there good people but very shocking today. I kindly told them review the recorder I gave you a twenty dollar bill got charged for both orders and no pot stickers left and forgot about it.there was a mistake.you lost a loyal customer today I was getting food for my little ones and wife . So I gave them my untouch meal that I went to go back at home to grab and said simply take this untouch food and give it away and I don't need your money back god bless. I will not go back I insisted for them to look at the tape but does not matter.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) Very shitty food and they said Coke is the same as Rc cola
My wonton soup taste like black pepper soup and soda taste like fauset water
The food is super bad and they sell you Coke and they give you Rc cola and they say it's the same and it tastes like tap water
My wonton soup tasted like pure rubbish pepper stock I do not recommend them I will never come back

<response>None</response><Time>1607464483489</Time><text>There's a reason this place has such great reviews. After the harrowing experience I had at an emergency vet , I waited til 7am to call sierra animal hospital and got an appt in at 9:30. They were timely, picked up my dog, asked what was going on, and a little while later I was talking directly to the doctor. She placed orders for x-rays, labs, fluids and other tests. In total, it came out to be 475.75 for my poor pneumonia ridden pup. Totally reasonable compared to the 2900 I was quoted elsewhere.

She returned to me better than I left her. Couldn't recommend a better vet .< /text><user>116296436064556835950<//user></record>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>They gave me the WRONG medication for my dog and refused to correct the mistake and give me the correct medication. Didn't realize until I got home b/c we have to wait in the parking lot and my senior dog was stressed out and I was already there almost an hour, so wanted to get him home. They Implied I was lying. I asked them to look at their security camera footage to show it was indeed their mistake, but they won't do it. No manager has called to try and get this corrected. They simply don't care about their incompetency. If you still take your pets there, triple check the med bottle to make sure they don't do this to you as well.</Text>< Pics>

I've been taking my fur baby here for a few years now. Hands down the best place for her, I know she is well taken care and the vets here really know what they're talking about. The staff are among the kindest people I've met! My little one has had a surgery done on her bladder here—for a great price when looking at comparisons— and it was so well done that she doesn't even seem to have much of a scar after healing up 💕 A definite reccomend!</text>

<review>Really happy with this vet. We have been seeing Dr. Battles for a few health issues with our cat. She is incrediy kind, patient, and willing to answer any questions we have. Most importantly, it's obvious she cares and would do whatever possible to help our pet.

In addition, the other staff has all been great. They are professional and kind and always a pleasure.to deal with.<//review><Resp>None</Resp><user>104886629144187275026</user>< user_name>

Dr. Conlan was very thorough with Finn, and able to look at several meds he on, evaluate things and come up with a simpler regimen that worked better to coax his complicated and nearing chronic medical condition toward health. He didn't get frustrated with the several medical issues and got us on schedule to keep in to of things moving forward.  I've had dogs for 40 years, taking all of them to the vet. This is a top notch doctor and clinic. What a relief!

The front office staff are professional, organized and are kind to my dog. It's easy to do business here.</Text>

< Review>
This vet office has been there for me for all stages of pet -- puppy, adult, senior.  They are honest, compassionate, gentle, and knowledgeable. I have been nowhere better (thanks about 9 different vets) since my first pet in 1992.  Wonderful vets and staff.<//Review>

Great service, the doctors know their stuff very well. Specialized in the German Shepherd/Police Dog breeds, along with all the other breeds as well. But GSD's are their bread and butter. I always leave knowing I can trust the veterinary surgeon. They have helped my dogs many times and they always recover. They removed a golf ball sized cyst from my 3yr old German Shepherd off of his lover spine. The procedure only took 10minutes and he was fine within a couple weeks, back to his old self, before the hair from where the procedure could even grow back he was totally fine and the growth was benign.
I love this veterinary clinic and highly recommend it!<//review>

Excellent service! Never felt any pressure when making decisions. I've only ever gone here so I don't really know if the price is the cheapest but I know I'll never go anywhere else. Very friendly staff and my dogs are pretty timid but are very comfortable around the veterinarian</text>

<text>I came in as a walk in with my dog. Even though they had a full schedule, they saw us quickly and were very attentive! Along with that, they were very friendly and seemed to love all the animals that came in.<//text>< pictures>

<review>I don't own a pet and am not a patient. I did use their restroom a while back and just wanted to write a nice review as a thank you because I was not a patient and they still let me use their restroom. Their office was clean and so was their restroom. I don't like using restrooms at fast food restauarnts because they are dirty. Pet hospital restrooms are always cleaner</review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Review>By far my favorite veterinary care in my 22 years of regularly needing it.  Super awesome staff!  Aside from being a joy to be around, Dr. Scheidt is honest and straight forward.  They treat you exactly  how they would want to be treated when managing furry family healthcare.  I've seen the miraculous recovery of a devastating injury through excellent critical care followed by the kind of acute care you would normally see in a human hospital.  Very Impressive!< /Review>< Name>

Having lost my first two dogs to the ‘parvo’ virus and getting sub-par care and advice from other clinics in town (at the cost of thousands of dollars I might add) I sold practically everything I had that the virus could have infected (i.e. house, car, furniture) and started over again with two wonderful labradors named Tubs and Bruttie.  Yes, I’m a dog nut.  My parents recommended Sierra Animal View Hospital because their animals have being going there for years and they had great things to say about this clinic.  I was worried I’d be a nightmare client, as I’m fiercely protective over my dogs and had trust issues with vets because of what occurred in the past.  Almost 2 years later, I couldn’t be more pleased.  Both the doctors and staff at Sierra are very proactive, caring, and most importantly, they are genuine animal lovers.  Animals can pick up on that.  Both of my boys just turned 2 years old, and are in fantastic health, in part, because of Sierra Animal View Hospital.  Easy 5 star review.</text>< pics>

<Review>Best Vet in the area! Always attentive to me and my pet, Stoney.  Stoney was Dr.'s oldest patient, until she had to put him down when I could no longer care for him.  He was 13 almost 14.  We all grieved his passing.  In loving memory of Stoney, I write this to affirm the passion and service given at Sierra View Animal Hospital.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
My dog (Claire) has had an enlarged heart now for a couple years. She has been on numerous medications and there finally came a time where the lasik just quit working. She was filling up with fluids in her belly and I was having my vet drain her with a needle and syringe. My vet had to have her heavily sedated as she would fight them putting the needle in her (one time the needle actually ripped her skin). As she continued to fill with the fluids, I was out of town visiting my folks and decided to go see Dr Scheidt as she was my vet in Fresno before I moved to the Bay Area. Not only did she and her amazing staff not have to sedate her, they removed more fluids than the previous vet without having to sedate her. They said their approach was a bit different than other vets. What I found after having this done several times with Sierra View Animal Hospital is that Dr Scheidt and her staff, have a care for their animals that I have never experience before. They are in this for the right reasons, to give your pet the best quality care they possibly can. Unfortunately the time came on Friday when I had to put my precious Claire down. Dr Scheidt and her staff helped me make the right decision based on Claire's condition. I cannot say enough about the quality of service that I received from Sierra View Animal Hospital. Although I live in the Bay Area, I will make the drive to Fresno to have my next pet receive the best quality of service that SVAH provides. Thank you again Dr Scheidt and your staff for taking such great care of my baby girl.</review>

I ordered the Garden Cobb Salad and I substitute the blacked chicken for the hard-boiled egg and apples for the tomatoes. I've ordered this many times before at the silverlake location and can't fathom why this location charged me $18 for the exact salad! Silverlake location has never done that. According to the cashier she couldn't remove it from the  register 🙄.</Text>

Staff here is super friendly and awesome, they make you feel right at home. There are tons of topping options and the salads are made with love. Always fresh food, and it usually lasts me two meals. One of my favorite lunch spots!</review>

Health food and the setting at this location is excellent. I give this spot two thumbs up. I've had nothing but enjoyable experiences here and plan to keep visiting. This place has a nice design.</text>

Modern, comfortable vibe, super fresh ingredients, killer dressings and very pleasant personnel.  Add indoor and outdoor seating with views of the foot and high end car traffic on Sunset and you have a place worth your time.

I did a "build your own" for $8.50.< /text>

Longest I've ever waited for seats at a restaurant, but completely worth it. The food is innovative, delicious and presented gorgeously. The staff was great too even when extremely busy. I will be back next time I'm in CA.<//Review>

Their salad section was massive. They had all types of salad.  You can't get lost here because the labeling is clear and visible to read.  Wonderful shop!</text>

Not at all worth it. Just a trifle amount of chicken in my salad. How disappointing and not even that tasty. I’m definitely going back to Lemonade restaurant.< /Text>

<Review>I really would like to try their food, but I was asked to wait outside as they only can have 4 people in the restaurant due to Covid. I completely understand safety precautions, but they kick you out on the insane heat to wait. Owner do not care about the customers as can  invest money in simple umbrella for customers willing to wait.</Review></record>

Sweet green is my favorite but whats the point of putting in a to go order when they service the 5 people in line before your order while you're standing there waitint to pick up? Just wasted my whole work break waiting for a salad 10 min after the pick up time.. 🤦‍♀️< /Text>

The addons make this salad place pricey. Still healthy and tasty. The meats and cooked items have roasted, not fried, choices. Parking is on Gower. Keep your ticket in hand for a 1 hour vaildation</Review>

<text>I want to give a shout out to TJ, who was so wonderful to interact with. Not only was he super smiley and just pleasant in demeanor but when I realized I messed up and ordered a salad for a vegan coworker with nonvegan dressing all over it, he made me a new salad at no charge and included 3 different dressings on the side so she could pick which one she wanted. He was so nice and understanding. Just great vibes in this Sweetgreens.< /text></record></dataset><record>

<rating>1</rating><text>Delivered food for this place on my bike. Was a hot summer day and I was direly saying excuse me towards the staff at the counter to ask for some water. Was completely ignored for 5 minutes. Never have had an experience delivering for such purposely neglectful and rude staff for a store. Ended up having to pause my delivery to the customer to stop for water elsewhere. Very upsetting short experience.<//text>< Pics>

Great salads and bowls, nice space to sit in, most of the ingredients are locally sourced from small producers. It's fresh and healthy with plenty of vegetarian and vegan options. If you end up building your own, beware that it will probably cost you quite a lot! But ordering from the menu is relatively good value. My vegan favorites are the shroomami warm bowl and the hummus tahini salad!<//review>

<review>Thanks to Covid-19 I ordered via the app and saved $5 bucks on the app. So I was certainly winning there. Went in and picked up from pick-up shelf with my name on it. The Green Goddess was perfect for the taking. Yooo the raw beets was a good addition too. I didn't take pictures because my phone died but I ate the whole thing before the time of expiration WITH pizza (Fresh Brothers). Sat in Franklin-Ivar park 4 mins away and lived life. I wish Dallas had one.🤔. Want a good good salad, sweetgreen got it. Love the dressing too!!< /review><resp>None< /resp>< Pictures>

<Text>You actually can't call Sweetgreens directly, their automated phone service does nothing for their clients. I wanted to order using their app because there are discounts they offer. But the app won't accept my home address, and I can't make contact with anyone directly at sweetgreens. Seems like they don't want to be bothered so in return I'll give them a 1 star review.</Text>< rating>

Only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because the employee making my salad made the salad of the person behind me at the same time, prolonging my wait time x2. Happen to be in a rush. All good tho would come back.<//Review>< userid>

< Review>
Really disappointed 😔

I had placed an order with the  app and selected the last viable  time frame  of 7:45 for pick up. I had placed the order at approx 7:30 . I had came up to the door  to get my meal  and the door was locked and nobody  came up ,and was  then approached by two guys and told that they didn’t make it and the cut off time for pickup was at 7:30. I hadExplained that 7:45 was the time selected for pickup and if they could at least honor  what the app promises  since I paid and that I had come all this way and was starving. The reaction  was a bit aloof and one of the two  guys ( black /mixed ) started hacking and coughing a bit without having his mouth covered or wearing a mask  . He did say he was sorry but This concerned me  at a time of the  virus being spread like wildfire.  Alex the manager told me to send an email to get a refund . I asked if they can do anything and he offered a water and I was on my way .
The experience Was very disappointing.
I hope sweetgreem will take more precautions with their customers health and hold up to the orders taken let alone notify the customer not to come if they can’t make it .</Review>

Eventually all the salads taste the same. Make your own for variation and get it split in two bowls for portion help.< /text>

I showed up 10 minutes after my pickup time and they still hadn't finished my order .. meanwhile, people in line we're getting their food left and right. I waited for half an hour to get an order that I placed basically an hour ago. So what's the point in adding a pick up time if you're going to sit there and wait for it?<//text>< Pictures>

Sweetgreen is one of my favorite healthy choices to visit. I will drive many miles just to get my Sweetgreen food fix. I was first introduce by them when I was in Boston and they are as fresh as I remembered. It's an amazing place for those looking for a healthy selection.</Text>

This location is amazing. Service is absloutly amazing. They are nice and let you try.
Michael helped me choose the Hollywood Bowl with goat cheese.
He even let me try the tofu, which i never had before in my life. I love it!
Their warm peppers and wild rice are the best.
Thanks Michael for suggesting the perfect stuff, and taking your time to helped me read the menu without my glasses.  You are the best!!!!< /Text>

<UserId.>112124268859347361802<//UserId.><text>So far the salads that I have gotten from there have been good. The reason for the 2 stars is that when I was in the restaurant I saw a worker clean the trash receptacle with a rag then proceed to wipe the guest tables and the serving area with the same dirty rag. The worker turned out to be a supervisor. If he doesn't know any better I'm sure he doesn't expect cleanliness from his staff either.

Very creative salad selection menu, lots of build your own salad options. It seems eating healthy can cost you, and Sweetgreen is no exception. For light eating it's great, but say after a work out you might still be feeling a bit hungry. Extra protein is an option though. It has become my go to place for fast healthy salad, though Tender Greens  is also a good choice if you want more protein for the price. I am thankful Sweetgreen exists since there are not as many healthy eating options in that part of Hollywood.</Review>

<review>Best chopped salad restaurant I’ve eaten at. I went in not knowing what it was, and when I saw it was chopped salad I was sad, but I’m always willing to give things a try so I ordered. It shouldn’t be that hard to make a good salad, right? I got the Hollywood ... because ... anyway, it was good. Really good. Highly recommend.

Why is it that this Sweet Greens on Sunset looks so disheveled.  3rd street is jamming line out the door and they manage to keep things tidy.  Your plants are dying,  burnt from the sun and all dried out nothing sweet about that.  I may have to come in and give them a bit of a trim. The last two times your ice machine was not working.  Zero napkins and utensils were a mess.  In addition you have those ugly cardboard produce boxes on top of your prep area,  those boxes are an incubator for lots of insects and bugs it's just gross. I see lots of people working but the majority look lost.  You have a beautiful new building a great salad concept, my favorite in LA.  However I'd rather drive all the way to third street then to just go down the street from my house on Sunset.  Get it together...please. 🍽 Edit 5/24/16. Wow!!! Love all the changes ! Love the sit down steps. Very hip💚 Plants are revived and The vibe is 💗 Fantastic YaY!!!!</review>

<review>I loooooove sweet green. Tender Greens is a close second and possibly tied with Mendocino farms but given Sweet's expertise in the plant quality aspect of the greens (and occasional seasonal delights), Sweet Green reigns supreme on most fronts. HOWEVER - the issue that I have with Sweet Green is the time it takes to get through. On high traffic times (ie, lunch), the line is out the door and it could easily take, 15-20 min to get a salad made. Now, Sweet Green is not the inventor of the made to order salad assembly line yet it beats all others due to quality. That's fine, but literally ever other salad spot I've been to that exists strictly for salads (Mendo and Tender don't count here) are wayyyyyyyyyy faster. Go to any no-name corner salad spot in NYC, Boston, SF or DC and you're in and out within 5 min. Yes it's not as fresh but this is a logistical bottle neck issue; not an issue with the food itself.

Or you can just order ahead and skip the subject of the entire rant I just made. They have possibly the easiest pick up and go I have ever experienced. Lesson here is to plan.<//review>< Response>

Very nutritious food. The dressing sauces they use are something very tempting! (Those gingery, sesame sauces, hot chilly...)
The place is very clean, and they serve on compostable plastic, offering bins for Recycling material. Gone back multiple times...</text>

Sweetgreen is the best salad place there is. End of story. If you eat salad regularly and you want a filling, nutritious salad made of top quality ingredients, this place will never let you down. I give this place the top praise I could ever give a restaurant. It fits in with my life and it makes me feel good.< /Text>

Ok, is there a 5 star salad? Well, if you want to taste the difference in what you’ve been missing, then come here.

I know some people who eat here everyday.... No frills, counter build custom salads. There are a handful of designed cold and mixed with warm item offerings, but you want it your way. So go custom.

Pick from a variety of leafy green, Mix then up, and pick 4 topping items to make it special. Add avocado, etc... toss, and dressing, shake and serve. Your taste buds will roar from unprecedented farm to table bliss. Chew and taste your way through the holy grail of salad bliss.

Yes, $12 is a bit pricey for salad. But this is no ordinary taste experience. Treat yourself to a very well selected balance of wonderful options to make your health and life better.

I actually felt energized when I left. Rarely does your food make you feel better.

Bring the family and friends. Expect to eat outside or take it home, there is little seating. And Parking is bad, but you may get one of several 15min spots up front.

I’m coming back.</text>

I really love this place, and I'm there about twice a week. My only problem, which is a major problem is the food isn't covered & none of the employees wear gloves. I'd like to continue eating there, but they must fix this issue..it's gross!!<//text>

I'm becoming irritated with my order not being ready in a timely fashion... If I ask to pick up at 1130am. That's when it should be ready. Here lately I've been waiting an extra 10mins if that were the case I'd just come in and order.<//text>

<text>(1.5 Stars ideally)
Gonna have to step in here with a little dose of reality. After going to 3rd street location and loving it (apart from the confused staff situation) i convinced my wife to go to this location that's nearer my house. It was suuuuper messy behind the counter. We got to go. My wife's salad was about a third smaller than mine. Mine barely had any of the protein. Ingredients had slipped in accidentally from the messy counter situation.
The boxes were shut with leaves coming out the side.
Mine didn't taste as good as the last time. I see they make the dressings in house. Something about the dressing this time was not right. So maybe that was why. Bummed I wasted a Saturday lunch on this rubbish, but I know for next time. I'm sure it's just a lack of quality control but life's too short to eat crappy food, when it's avoidable.
So I think I'm good on Sweetgreens for now.
Hopefully my score helps level this out so people don't get lured in by the great reviews and 4.9 only to realise they should have gone to 3rd street or somewhere else)</text><rate>2<//rate><time>1501362558726< /time><user>109150129270283432151<//user></record>

(Translated by Google) Los Angeles is known today for being cutting edge in health food and Sweetgreen is a result of it.

It's like a healthy food Subway, but instead of ingredients of dubious origin, it has great inputs, fresh, diverse vegan options, with a well-trained staff that ultimately serves good quality and tasty food.

It's not because it's fast food that it needs to be junk food and Sweetgreen is proof of that.

Los Angeles é conhecida hoje por ser vanguarda no que diz respeito à comida saudável e o Sweetgreen é resultado disso.

É como se fosse um Subway da comida saudável, só que ao invés de ingredientes de origem duvidosa, possui ótimos insumos, frescos, diversas opções veganas, com uma equipe bem treinada e que no final serve comida de boa qualidade e saborosa.

Não é porque é fast food que precisa ser junkie food e o Sweetgreen é prova disso.<//text>

<review>Staff was perfectly attentive. The liquid nitrogen cocktails were delicious and worth the show. A must try is their French toast. Excellent brunch spot with virtually no wait. If you're on line up the street and don't want to wait an hour, head here. It may even be better.<//review>< Pics>

Love your LN2 Take Home Pizza Kit!!  Since we can't enjoy eating fresh pizza made at your restaurant this is definitely the next best thing.  It's also a great way to share your great food with others.  My grandkids also enjoyed making their own special pizzas - so easy for a 7 yr and 4 yr old to make.  Of course they enjoyed eating it too!< /Text>

It was just fantastic. Had the Escargot, Fois Grois, Lobster Bisque. Chateaubriand was our main course. For Dessert we had the Brie and soufles. I loved everything about the restaraunt. I would definitely go back and try the lamb.Our neighbor was having a filet mignon, off menu just as my fois grois was off menu.<//Review>

<text>MANAGER IS SUPER COOL.

Came in with a groupon; was sensitive to dietary restrictions and worked with us.
His service is stellar, and how I envision at a fine dining establishment,  even during unprecedented covid times.

Can't go wrong with the duck confit tacos 😋  the short ribs with onion rings and the kobe burger are also 👌

If there were 50 stars available, LN 2 would rate 500.

Pizza is a destination at LN2
Go for the Pepperoni. Stay for the L (liquid) N (nitrogen) ice cream 2. (Made before your or your kids' eyes. )

Be sure to make a stop at Popcorn Brussel Sprouts,  linger for the Chick Pea Fritters dawdle with the tiniest Hamachi Taco, wash down with 1972 Vintage J and B.

Do not pass go. Collect a unique experience in a supremely designed indoor space where you can hear a conversation, only to be surpassed by an outdoor garden where Brunch is a luxurious pleasure.</text>

<Review>I've lived in Italy and NYC, and have been in LA for years. This is easily the best restaurant in Los Angeles. The polenta dish was as good as any I've had in Italy. Same goes for the burrata and prosciutto pizza. Spot on. They're in their own class here.

I went in with a very large group and they accommodated all of us and treated us really well. Not like other places around town. 3 of us were strict vegan, and they were accommodated no problem. The staff was super cool even though we were a little rowdy. Everything I tasted from other people's plates was noticeably eyebrow raising. The hamachi is amazing also.

They also made us some crazy cosmopolitans where smoke was billowing out of the glasses. It was quite a show.

This is the spot. Look no further. Highly recommended.<//Review>< Time>

Stopped in for some ice cream even though it was close to closing time.  We were warmly greeted by the owner who made us feel welcome.  I ended up having an affogato, caramelly espresso topped with ice cream; the ice cream was made for us right then - when we ordered - through the magic of liquid nitrogen.  My husband asked for the cookies and cream with M&Ms mixed in.  Creamy, delicious, amazing, a great ending to our evening.<//text>

< Review>
Opening week!  We stopped by this new neighborhood restaurant and try it out.  They’ve done a huge remodel of the previous restaurant.  Though it’s a pizza place they have an extensive non-pizza menu.  It’s impressive that they have 3 duck items on the menu.   We did the dineLA menu for $29.  The Brussels sprouts popcorn was nicely fried with a great dipping sauce.   The gem salad was well portioned and tossed nicely.  The buffalo duck wings (you never see this outside of Chinese and Taiwanese restaurants as an appetizer or snack) was fantastic!  Meat was tender and juicy, skin crisp with a bright citrus spicy sauce.   The LN2 ice cream has many flavors and you pick serving style (waffle, brûlée bananas or plain bowl), toppings and sauce.  I did the market strawberry, bananas, earl grey anglese and the balsamic pearls.  The balsamic was awesome as was the bananas.  Both the strawberry and the mint chip I wanted just a little more brightness but very much enjoyed the meal and very attentive staff!  Certainly will come back and recommended to those who like bold flavors and interesting creative menus.<//Review>

<Review>LN2 Pizza Shoppe has the most delicious pizzas ever (fabulous dough). I love the margherita and shrooms pizzas. The salads are scrumptious. The list of wines is great. We tried the Malbec and the Cabernet Sauvignon, which were delicious. If two, you can each have a baby lettuces salad and share a pizza and it's a reasonable fare. The strawberry ice cream is fabulous. The décor and service are awesome. I highly recommend it.< /Review>< Pics>

These guys were AMAZING from start to finish.  Our furnace and a/c unit died. We called Costco and waited 3 days for them to contact us. Told them it was an emergency. Finally just looked up who they use and called Royal Aire. Matt was amazing, got us an appointment first thing the next morning, Danny came out and was so nice! Sat down and talked to us, told us all our options, what to expect, etc. We needed an all new A/C and Heater and to have the ducts sealed. Much to our surprise install was the next day! We were so happy! The group of young men that came out were outstanding. Professional and polite! I only remember the name of one, Eric, but every single one was awesome! Kudos to your workers Royal Aire! They were fast and it was so nice to have heat again! We paid what we expected to pay for a really good system. All in all our entire experience was great with Royal Aire. I highly recommend them!< /text>

This local company does excellent work for a great price and they really care about their customers. I bought my HVAC unit from them and then added a service contract. I also chose them when it came time to put solar on my roof. It is their professionalism and friendly knowledgeable staff that keep my business.</review>

<Text>Donnie Cope came out today and cleaned out all 4 of our heating and air conditioning units, repaired one unit, installed new filters and got all of our systems running smoothly - we love it!  We signed up for the Royal Aire maintenance program so that now our building will get regular heating and air conditioning maintenance.  It is a good deal!  They even gave owner Doug a discount for being a Vietnam Veteran, so that was great.

We want our building to have a heating and air conditioning system that is kept up to date, because in this area it is too hot during the summer to have a breakdown.  When Donnie was here he helped us get a good idea of what is going on with our system, so now we can feel a lot more comfortable about our heating and air conditioning system.  Thanks, Donnie!< /Text></record></dataset><record>

The technician Shane was a delight. He was very helpful and answered my questions.  I hope he is the one that comes to do heating maintenance in the fall.<//Review>

<Text>Bill was everything that you should expect from a first class company.  The tech was able to answer all of my questions and more regarding my mini-split/heatpump (Fujitsu). And because I am more than just a customer, he was able to get me a slight discount.

Royal Aire has now installed the following items in my home over the past 10 years:  Solar, Mini-split, Furnace, Whole House water filter system, under the sink water filters, R19 added attic insulation,& whole house Ultraviolet air filter system.  All were done with precision, neatness, and the best quality products available.  Next spring will add the whole house attic fan with Royal Aire.</Text></record>

The original furnace was clearly not placed by this company, venting was done into the attic.  Feel much safer and warmer.  18 years with the first one before it died, we feel lucky, glad we had CO2 monitors for the living area and no alarms.< /review>

I had a great experience with Royal Aire. They had a cancellation earlier the day of my appointment and called to see if I’d like a technician to come out earlier. It worked out really well since it was supposed to be 110 that day! The technician, Omar, was prompt, professional, friendly and helpful. He performed a routine check up of our system, kept us informed as he progressed and made the whole process easy and informative. I would recommend Royal Aire.< /Text>

I was expecting to get a service tech that would diagnose my system and all I got for $79, was an estimate to replace ever major component in the system.  total cost over $6000. i am thinking the tech get a commission

< Review>
So my AC unit is dripping underneath my house, the evap. pan has rusted through. When I noticed the dripping, I called Royal.

The person on the phone recommended that I sign up for their monthly plan, and have the system maintained, and to let the maintenance tech know the issue I was having. I took her advice.

The maintenance tech looked me in the eyes and told me the unit was not leaking when I asked. Next time I crawled under my house, it was still leaking, he didn't check. I called Royal to express my frustration. They sent out a senior tech, followed by a salesman.

The senior tech explained that the leak could not be fixed, and the salesman wanted me to buy a new unit. The salesman had to hand write a quote for me on a piece of printer paper that I provided my self.

I called to cancel the monthly fee a couple months ago. My wife just told me I AM STILL BE CHARGED EVERY MONTH.

Go ahead and do business with Royal, but I never will again. The nice folks at McClellan can at least email me an itemized estimate.</Review>

Purchased a home back in April and noticed the a/c wasn't working properly. After reading countless reviews decided to give Royal a call. Had a technician come out the next day. He tried to talk us into replacing the entire unit, including the brand new condenser that was installed during escrow. He settled for putting in 5lbs of freon once he couldn'ttalk us into a $5000 job, and left, with instructions on  observing the unit for the next few days to see how it reacted, and we signed up for the monthly membership package from Royal Air. We Contacted the original installer of the condenser after the technician left. He had to remove 4lbs of the freon that was added because it overloaded and almost ruined our new condenser unit; turned out it was a $20 part that was a manufacturer malfunction in the comdenser, and the original installer repaired it no problems. Ac still will freeze you out!

After being upset with our experience with the money grabbing and poor service, I decided to cancel our newly acquired subscription 3 days after sign up, and GOT CHARGED FOR 4 MONTHS. Contacted payment department multiple times, left numerous messages, and they finally canceled after 4 months, then charged us for the freon on top of that.

Highly recommend Royal Air if you like to waste your money and enjoy the worse customer service in regards to the office (our technician that came out was super nice, but pushy and misdiagnosed our problem) . If you don't question their charges, you'll have a fantastic experience, but the second you notice something wrong they will give you the go around for months, and try to send you to collections for services unrendered! I'm still waiting for my receipt from paying off any outstanding bills.

Also, I fully expect a reply from the company stating that they will reach out to further discuss my experience, but I know that's just them blowing smoke considering that my husband also left a review and Royal Air replied that they will be in touch soon; we're still waiting for that call 6 months later.</text>

Quick, and timely service. However, when I called to inquire as to follow up for the status of verification of warranty on part that was replaced, I was informed I would receive a call back, but did not hear back from anyone. Even if they had to confirm they could not get the warranty to cover the replaced part, a call back as had been assured, would have been appreciated.</review>

<review>Met with Dan to get a new AC unit for a disabled Veteran. We were award a grant from the VA to pay for the unit. I passed on all the information needed so they can work with the VA directly.
Now 4 months later, they are threatening to place a disabled veteran in collections because they can't seem to get their act together.
This has been a nightmare and now we are forced to take legal action to get this whole thing figured out.
To any disabled Veterans: If you qualified for a grant and are looking to get a new Heating or AC unit. Please go with a different company who knows what they are doing and has worked with the Veterans before. This has been nothing but a HUGE nightmare for me and my family.</review><userid>104150701107084453827</userid><Pics>None<//Pics>< gmapID>

The 28 year-old ducts for heating and cooling the rooms in my home were in need of replacement. How did I know this? During one of my recent bi-annual service check-ups by Royal Aire, photos were taken and shared with me. It was an easy and important decision. And the follow-up was immediate while the service was still being conducted. I was put on the phone with Bob who provided several options and several ways to pay. I made my decision and the replacement work was scheduled within the week. The replacement duct work done by Jesse and Nate was excellent. They arrived on time and thoughtfully went about their business. They worked steadily and efficiently. They were able to complete the job in one full day. They informed me what they were doing at each step of the way. And they cleaned up everything both inside my home and out on the street. These two are excellent representatives of Royal Aire. Kudos to them and to Royal Aire for hiring the people that do the job right!</review>

<Review>***update below. Buyer beware.

We had a problem, A/C wasn't blowing cold air and the line was freezing. Called Royal Aire, they sent a tech the next day. He reviewed our unit, had us turn it off but run the fan to unfreeze it. Came back the day after, told us it would cost about 1500 to run something through the lines to find a freon leak, and he put more freon in the unit. Was told it may be thousands more if we needed a new A/C. Got a hold of the person that initially installed the unit, he came out and looked at it. It was one bad piece that came with the brand new unit. He spent 30 dollars buying a new one and replacing it. Still paid 170 + the monthly plan (first month only. Cancelled as soon as we found out what the real problem was).

All in all, would not recommend. We may have just been a bad day or something, but it could've been an extremely expensive mistake on their part for us.

Update: they not only did not cancel the monthly plan when I asked them to, they sent me a bill for 50 dollars when I caught it on my statement months later to finish paying over 300 dollars for a bad diagnosis and a "fix" because it provided "cooling for the day he put the freon in. If we had come back out to remove it, we would have just swallowed the cost". So. All in all, 300 dollars for a bad diagnosis, and a fix that could have caused damage to our unit. One star, do not use them if you can help it. Their reply for reaching out to me? Never happened. I had to call them when I realized they chose to continue charging me after I asked them to cancel the monthly plan.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< resp>

<Review>We had a great experience with Royal Aire. The original tech couldn't determine if the issue was our circuit board or blower motor, they sent out a different tech to finalize the opinion and get the part shipped in. With in a few days it was back in and we've got AC again.

My only issue was with the companies coordination. When inquiring about our installation date we were told one day and then it changed the next. Then we were told that they'd over night the part but that didn't happen. We also were never originally quoted on the part and only given a rough estimate. When we called to get the actual pricing we couldn't get a solid answer until after the instal. It was a bit disheartening but we stuck with them and were super understanding and eventually the logistics of it all worked out. They were super kind and helpful in the end and I would 100% recommend you go with them. Our experience was an anomaly.< /Review>< pics>

<text>The technician that was sent out was not trained on Mini splits when they knew that's what the item was they were coming out to look at. he had issues because the measurements on it were metric I tried to explain to him there's easy conversion charts online and then in the end after charging me almost $80 to tell me my unit wasn't working they said that they couldn't work on my mini split.  It wasnt their brand.. good information they could have told me before I spent 80 bucks. By the way they were on time
Thanks.<//text>< response>

I'm in the middle of a nightmare. Bought a $13,000 Lennox AC system from Costco/Royal Aire. Because of their incompetent installation, the unit leaked for 3 months before I discovered the mess (slow leak). Tens of thousands of dollars damage and they are refusing to pay actual replacement costs and have delayed making repairs now for almost 2 months. I had to refi my house just to pay for the new AC. They've made my life miserable. Now all I can do is tell as many people as possible to NOT use them.< /Text>

<text>Steven Maranto from Royal Aire  was just out to service my A/C unit. He was on time and went over all the service work he would perform. My unit is 20 yr old but works Great because Royal Aire has a service plan that is supper. Steven has all of the state of the art tools to do a complete tune up and bring to my attention possible failures because of the age of the unit. He detected that the Freon was 1/2 lb low and filled it up. Had this not ben detected later on when the Temp rises it would not perform as efficiently. He them washed down the unit and got all of the dirt out of the  Coil. He also brought to my attention their new lower cost service plan that will save me MONEY.

The written contract specified (27) panels with microinverters.

Initially, a sub-contractor drilled (10) ten, eight-foot-deep anchor footings.  It was pointed out that the installation would be oriented southeast, rather than south.  The driller verified the directional error, but had to wait for the Royal representative to return.  Royal had laid out the drilling locations.  Solar generation would likely be reduced 20% and much of the lost generation ability would have to be paid at double rates (time of use) from PG&E.  The holes were re-drilled in the proper locations.  The trench was not cleared prior to utility placement.  They did route a larger than required conduit.  However, the trench and abandoned anchor holes were left for the owner to back-fill.  They left the footing caps rough with profuse quantities of spilled concrete; the expansive soil also left floating gaps of concrete islands.

The solar installation was trenched in a ninety-degree arc (i.e., no conduit fittings, straight pipe only).  The subcontractor trenched through an existing 2” waterline and 1” conduit in multiple locations.  The first waterline repair blew-out in a 25-foot-high geyser.  The 1” CPVC electric conduit was repaired with waterline fittings; I re-repaired them with the proper long-radius electrical sweep fittings.

Royal submitted an application to PG&E to connect.  The application was for a kilowatt less power than contracted.  They tell me it’s the same and PG&E just writes it differently.  No, peak power is peak power.  Final payment is withheld.  Royal pulled the (27) 215watt Siemen’s inverters and install (28) 250watt Enphase inverters; they also added a 28th solar panel.  The system now has a peak output of 7 kw.  I can live with that.

A summer or two ago a swampy area, with standing surface water, appeared in the back field. Unlike metal pipe, PVC does not corrode underground.  Buried PVC should stay intact for hundreds of years.  Properly installed solvent welded joints should last just as long as the pipe substrate.  I was not looking forward to the repair of an item that should never need repair.  It was the final straw and was the reason for this review.  A couple of man-days were wasted fixing something that should never need fixing…if it had been done right originally.

First, dig down in the swamp to find the leaking pipeline.  Next, determine the leak location.  The pipeline must be followed until the failure point is found.  Wet clay soil does not readily release from digging tools; the blades must be scrapped.  Fun.  Dig until the suspected leaking fitting is exposed.  Recharge the water line.  Water and air begin discharging, thus confirming the leak location.  Shut-off the water again.

The hole is enlarged to provide access to the failed joint.  A 1” conduit lies atop the failure point.  A 6-foot section of the conduit must be removed to gain access to the failed pipe below.  Soil is excavated from below the offending pipeline as well.  While digging around the pipe, one of the joints appears to shift.  Lifting the pipe causes the joint to separate intact.  Prying on the other end gets the other end to release as well.  Each pipe end was inserted about ½” (less than 40%) into the fitting.  Properly glued joints fuse so well that ¼” radial fitting sections are difficult to separate from the pipe with a hammer and sharp-edged chisel…. impossible if the outside fitting perimeter is intact.  Solvent welded joints also don’t degrade with time.  It’s a homogeneous material.  Both water and conduit lines were repaired and tested.  No leaks were detected.  All new joints have better than 80% insertion and were not glued in muddy water.

Sincerely,

Greg Shea, PE

<Review>We requested Eduardo to come & look at our heating unit as it suddenly stopped working. He checked the unit & found the motor needed to be replaced.

Some creepy guy named Rob Selko was staring into our windows, they left nails all over the ground, popped a car tire they send a guy with a magnet to pick up the few left after I spent hours cleaning up, cracked our ceiling above bedroom windows after being too rough on our roof, which was newly installed. Was told the job wouldnt take long, it took them 2 and a half days to install 20 panels what a joke. We are still being charged about the same from PGnE but now we owe royal air 1200 a year ontop of PGnE, liars and slow,lazy drink employees partying on my roof.< /review>

He was extremely thorough, including taking many pics of my rooftop unit to show me after he did my maintenance. Went over details. We discussed my ducting and he made some very helpful observations. New return filters. All for the originally quoted maintenance fee. It was an excellent service experience!

Out AC went out on a Friday night...everything we did to repair it Saturday did not work..so we of course had to find someone who would come out on a Saturday and not charge a crazy amount! We paid $109 for the trip out...not unheard of after calling other place  and the tech was able to come out that day. He was quick, and explained the problem...easy fix. The part was definitely marked up...we could have paid significantly less if we bought it elsewhere...but for the convenience alone it was worth it!</review>

My experience was not good in anyway shape or form. My Grandmother had them come out they did over $2800 in repairs. My Grandmother passed away shortly after that. I put her home up sale. The buyer called for an inspection of the system they told the buyer it needed a whole new system.  Funny just a few month prior it was all repaired. I showed the buyer the paperwork from the technician from 2 months previous and Royal aire's official answer was every technician has their own opinion after inspection of a system.< /review>

< review>
Terrible customer service, called and spoke with somebody to arrange for an estimate for some HVAC work.  They took my info and stated that the person that handles that would get back to me.  I waited a couple days and then recalled.  I was told that the person I needed to talk to was in a meeting and would call me back as soon as they were finished.  It's been a week now with no contact...

UPDATE:

Royal Aire was more responsive to my negative review than my service request.  You have my contact info, I called in 3 separate times and gave it to you.</review>

I'm changing my review from a 1 star to a 5 star. My touch screen panel for my thermostat went out after just a few months, and not only did Royal Aire return my call the very next day but they also had somewhat out to fix it in less than 24 hours after it broke, no questions asked. On a Sunday no less. I went from deeply frustrated to pleasantly surprised. Fantastic customer service, and the technician, Nick, was extremely professional and friendly. Thank you for the quick fix.</Review>

We purchased our unit from Royal Aire in 2017, we have
had nothing but great service from this company. We recently had a small problem of an oder in the unit. They were right on it. They have a great service manager who cares!</Review>

<Rate>5< /Rate><Review>Royal Aire installed my new AC, furnace, water heater and new propane service equipment 11 years ago and have provided maintenance services twice a year ever since. Mark arrived as scheduled this April -- on time, took extraordinary care to explain what he was going to do, wore shoe covers when he entered the house, reported the results after the testing, cleaned the filter and the AC unit, set up the October appointment, and answered every question.  The services really are "services" geared to the customer's needs, from  office response to technician's expertise. Really inspire trust.< /Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Like that they visit every 6 months to inspect and help out our HVAC system but don't like they make next appt without talking to us.  Then they only call to confirm the day before, we've missed them because we were out of town.</text>

Today Mark K and Jason S with Royal Aire visited and did an excellent job. They even looked at my water heater. They made sure the side gate was closed and garage door was closed. Keep up the good work.< /text>

Customer service is alive and well here at Royal air.... We had a problem with one of the techs he was having an off day and it showed...by the time he left we were really annoyed and wrote a review reflecting that. First thing the next morning I received a phone call from Bob the service manager he wanted to start by saying he was sorry.... he made no excuses he was genuinely upset that we didn't get the best service possible (loved that) and so was the tech that had come out (very big of him to admit he was wrong). The professionalism that Bob and Royal air showed us was so refreshing. In this day and age to get someone who will listen to you, and treat you with respect, even though your complaining to them is amazing!!! Thank you so much! We all have off days it's how we handle them that sets each of us apart....if you want a company that will value you as a person, and not just a name on a work order, this is the place. Thank you again Bob Brown, because of you we will be coming back to Royal Air for future heating and air needs :-)</text>

However, I do have a problem with their door to door solicitation.  I have two separate signs on my house that say NO SOLICITING. Today's Royal Aire employee (who noted the signs) tells me that he is not soliciting.

Upper Management training is needed at Royal Aire and any business for that matter when training their representatives to believe and/or think that they are not in fact soliciting homeowners when they are. The definition of the word "solicitation" is, "the act of asking for or trying to obtain something from someone".

In short if the goal is to get me to purchase something - you better be selling Girl Scout cookies!!!!<//text>< Pictures>

Last year we bought air and air conditioner and heating unit from Royal Heating and Air. The installation was quick and the guys were courteous. However when we have the inspection done it failed, they had to come back out and fix some things to get it passed. They offered us a twice a year inspection on the unit with a 1 filter replacement after a year. After 6 months of having the unit they came out and did their inspection and found that there was insulation blocking up the filter so they had to replaced it due to it being clogged, and we have insulation in our vents, and have installation smell since. Then 6 months later they came out and found that it needed to be changed again and proceeded to charge us $100 for a second filter when it wasn't even our fault for the first filter. My wife told the tech that we were not paying for a second filter and he disagreed and called his boss and told him that he was changing out the filter and that we refuse to pay for it. His boss was supposed to call us back and never did, after getting a bill from them I called my salesman who no longer works for the company and he calls them and ask why we are paying for a second filter when the first filter wasn't even our fault, he then told us that they said that they would take care of it. Yet again we get another bill saying that we are late on paying our filter I don't understand how we pay $30,000 for a unit and having an issue with them picking up the filter. I would not recommend them to anyone.</review>

Would not recommend.

Although I thought the price was high at the time, I decided to go with them as I needed to get it in quickly which they were able to do.  This was a connection through Lowes who I do a lot of business through.

They evaluated my two story floor plan and told me what was required.   They did not believe the lower floor needed vents.  My 20+ year old swamp cooler did just fine pushing air downstairs from the top floor but not this expensive full central Air unit. Unfortunately I just went with them and did not get others quotes or advice (my mistake).

People staying in the lower floor have complained how warm it is (never before on lower level with swamp cooler) and it is clear I need vents down there.  Naively I thought they would either stand by it or they would not charge me much to run two additional two vents directly below the one on top to address this.  We are talking about 1 to 2 feet.   We are talking about cutting a hole in the wood floor, hooking up to the vent pipe that is right there at floor level and popping it through on the other side of the floor.  The unit is plenty big for the house...just needs the vents.  We are not talking about running long distances or anything challenging.

They are quoting me $2600+ to do this.  I don't feel good about it and feel I am being taken advantage of.  Something is not right.  It looks like I will pursue a competitor or do it myself as it really does not look like a big job.

I am only giving a 2 rather than a 1 as the install team was excellent and I believe might have even did the little extra work if I would have asked them....but I thought I was OK.

Unfortunately....I would not recommend.

I will also recommend to Lowes to send their good customers to another vendor.<//Review>

<review>I was out of town when my wife called on a hot Sunday afternoon and explained that the air conditioning stopped working.  I asked if the fan on the outdoor unit was running and she said it was not and that it was making a humming noise.  I suggested she call someone she could trust to look at it.  She called Royal Aire and within an hour the technician arrived.  He found that the motor start capacitor was defective and replaced it with a after market (not original equipment) capacitor.  The unit began working immediately and the work was completed in less than an hour.  The bill was $390.00.  The capacitor cost $251.00 dollars and the remainder was for the service call and labor.  He said he could sell her a maintenance agreement for only $20.00 more.  The maintenance agreement provides for two additional future service calls to check to see if the unit is operating correctly and, if parts are required, it provides a 15% discount on the parts.  My wife thought it was a good deal and signed for the maintenance agreement.  The total cost was $410.00.

I am an electrical engineer.  I know what a motor start capacitor is and its function.  I also know a motor start capacitor costs anywhere from $20 to $$90 depending on the type required.  the original equipment capacitor for our unit costs about $40.  The aftermarket capacitor that the technician installed was an Amrad Engineering Turbo 200X.  It sells on line for $60 to $100 depending on where you buy it.  Another company in Chico told me they would have charged me $30 to $60 for the part depending on the specific type.

It is my opinion that Royal Aire overcharged my wife for the part.  My wife doesn't know a motor start capacitor from a cement mixer.  I think he took advantage of her.  He could have told her the part cost $500 and she would have paid it.  If I had been there I would have paid for the technician's time and replaced the capacitor myself if he refused to give me a fair price for the part.  I wouldn't have signed up for the maintenance agreement.  I called and emailed the owner of Royal Aire and asked him to call me.  He never did.</review>< pictures>

We had a terrible experience. Our 12 year old AC stopped blowing cool air so we called Royal Aire. The service technician Mike said that parts had burned and melted. He claimed it was at the end of its lifespan and that the model was or soon would be obsolete so he strongly recommended replacing it. The salesperson then called and gave us pricing of AC units between $8000 - $14,000. Although we have had NO problems with our heating, he offered "discount packages" to replace both for up to $20,000. Alarmed at the thought of having such a large unexpected expense, we called HIGNELL for a second opinion. They came, found the burned part, replaced it for $140. Done.

I would NEVER recommend having work done by Royal Aire unless they change their ways and stop SCAMMING people. If we had put our trust in Royal Aire, we would have spent thousands of dollars on something that was absolutely unnecessary.</review>

They are prompt and they know how to do the work. However, they were overly aggressive in "selling" (well, just adding it onto the invoice without discussing it with me) the annual service plan. I had to make an angry phone call. They're charging an $80 diagnostic fee on a unit with a 10-year warranty that failed after 2 1/2 years. (Maybe I should have bought their service plan?)  Maybe I'm too programmed by my own paranoia, but owners of non-owner occupied houses, shop around.</Review>

I had a new HVAC installed 2 years ago. I was told that one of the ducts had been disconnected probably by some other service company that had been in my attic. It appeared as if someone had fallen onto it and never fixed it. So after thousands of dollars spent on a new system I still had air flow issues.
The 2 vents farthest away just had no flow. I had them check it again. They said it was the way the addition was set up dovetailing off the existing unit. The only way to fix that would be to add new ducts at the cost of $900.  But that is not the kicker.....
I had a bid from another company today. I saw pictures of my ducts. They are ALL SMASHED.  One of them is even twisted! So if I am paying a company thousands of dollars to install a hew HVAC unit don't you think they should inform me that there are issues with the ducts?  Maybe advise me to fix or replace them? The twisted one is even one that they HAD to see as it is on the HVAC!  C'mon! REALLY????!!!
My advice....Get a bid from anyone else before you commit to the Royal treatment.</text>

i have never been so disappointed in doing business with other so called professionals. i was tremendously let down  and felt important. i wanted to order an igniter lennox #gcs10-513-751y. the owner/customer service manager said he could not order the lennox part, without reason and rudely hung up the phone. They are the only authorized lennox dealer in town. i called multiple times and they never did their job and the last phone call the receptionist said the owner wont order parts for me. when asked why she said the owner said no is no, and hung up the phone.
Eventually lennox partPlus found parts # for me.< /Review>

I've been doing business with Royal Aire for approximately 6 years now and have spent well in excess of $10,000 with them. They've been 5 star great. Until now. So when my wife called me, while I was at work, to say the AC wasn't working, it was 108* outside and 90* inside, I told her to stay calm and carry on while I immediately called Royal Aire. It was 4:39 PM and I was pleasantly surprised to find out they'd come out, after hours, on a holiday, for only $30 extra, and they'd see me between 8-10. Sweet. Upon my arrival at home I found a hot and sweaty family melting around the house. I immediately set out to troubleshoot the problem myself and eliminated several things. At this time a friendly and neat Royal Aire employee showed up (on time) and I filled him in on what I had done. He scratched his head, perplexed, and said he'd need to call in the multi zone expert (he was only qualified to work on equipment). I walked him through how the zones worked and explained how to troubleshoot them. Once I confirmed they weren't the problem we checked several other areas, at my suggestion, and ultimately discovered the problem, a frozen over coil. The solution: let it thaw out and carry on. Done. After 20 minutes of following me around, I was surprised when the fellow charged me full price for the pleasure of showing him how to do his job. Don't get me wrong, I'm positive he'd have figured it out in due time (after calling in a zone expert).

I called the next day and spoke to "Bob" the service manager. Bob tried convincing me he'd already lost money by only charging me full price. I explained to him his price structure was his own problem and even if he lost money on me he had more than been compensated over the years by the business and dollars I already gave the company. Bob then tried to up-sell me on a service plan (no thanks, I can hose off my filters and unit myself, thanks). Ultimately we agreed on a price where I didn't feel cheated and Royal Aire was more than compensated for their drive and tour of my home. I didn't charge them for the impromptu training I gave their employee.

The problem was Bob's terrible attitude even after our negotiated settlement. Never a "sorry," "our apologies" or "we understand." No, nothing from Bob but animosity and confrontation. You already have $10,000 of service from me and countless more dollars of profit if our relationship continues in the future. Your 3 star rating will go up if your attitude improves. It will also go down if my refund check never appears. I'm watching you Bob.

Edit: Well, Bob followed through with his promise on our settled agreement. Kudos to you Bob. Will I continue my service with Royal Aire? Yes, however, they're on probation. I've upped their star ratting but I'm holding back on the 5th star for now. The next time I do business with them, if they give me the fantastic service I'm used to, they'll earn back the star.

Bottom line: Royal Aire is a trusted and true company but needs to polish up their custom service in regards to complaints.</review>

Our AC has been broken for FOUR days now and have had the same guy come out to look at our AC twice. Nothing has been fixed and we were told "leave it off for 2 hours and it should work after". Worst customer service I have received and they do not seem to care we are living in a 90 degree apartment in 100 degree weather outside.< /review>

<text>They usually have the parts that other stores make you wait days to get but some of the young employees need training the last time I shopped there I asked for an espesific part with part number the dude even showed me in the computer monitor 3 choices with different price and manufacturer I pointed to an espesific one the one I told him in the first place he went to the back came back with all 3 choices and showed me all 3 products what's so hard to understand about a part number ...work on that o'reilly's<//text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
This was my go to store until I called one of their employees to order a steering box for a 1973 Firebird. I asked the employee to order  the Steering box for me and give him my personal details to call me back. After three days I called and spoke to Second employee named Jessica said she would do the same give me a call back. After 3 days of her no calling me I decided to call the store and kindly ask the manager to order it for me. We spoke for 2 minutes and said he would take care of it it's been 6 days now.</review>

I can never find parking for this reason! I stopped coming to this place because there is always beer cans all over the floor! I recently saw fireworks everywhere!! And it’s not like anyone can find parking here anyways. I see gangsters parking there staring at me awful and people parking their cars and walking to their homes. To top it off, I have to wait to get helped out. Need more employees! Disgusting place. Do not reccomend

Man this place is awful. The staff doesn't  know what they are doing. They made me waste my time for 6 hours I bought a part for my car they said " oh this is the part for your car it will fit blah blah blah" so I get to my mechanic and the part doesn't fit so I drove back and I told them what happen. they look at the part and said this is the part. At this point I was just upset they where helping other people not me. Not professional at all so they  Kept my part they said they will rebuilt it and blah blah blah so I when to a different place like 2.1 miles away they had the part and it was a friendly place and very fast.. and I toke the part to my mechanic and done deal... but never again going back their again< /text>

<Text>T.J.MAX, WALMART THEATERS?. Well they were before the virus. The killer is IN N OUT BURGER... That alone is worth the stop. Good food, at a killer price.

This AMC is much more up to date than AMC 14  on Saratoga. The Dolby and the Prime are fantastic! It's also nice that they have security guards now. The food drink counter's are clean and kept tidy. The popcorn was incredibly fresh. The only complaint is the actual theaters inside are not as cleaned and vacuumed. Let's hope they change all the theaters here to recliners.</text>

It's nice place to watch new movies, I was in Imax, we were watching previews so I was expecting lower sound but when the main movie started the sound was very low and terrible.
They needs to get better surround sound like other AMC has. Best sound so far at AMC 12 at newpark. Alaways best experience there.< /Review>

Great place for take out orders.  I love Tomatina's for take out!  There's a Krispy Kreme next store too! There are a few other restaurants too but Tomatina's is like a magnet. There's a good TJ Maxx there as well for shopping inspiration!</review>

This theater seems to always be clean and the staff is always friendly. The screens never seem to be in a state of disrepair. They run the newest releases and have a variety of formats. I like the food too. There is a bar, but I have no experience with that particular feature.
On this visit, I saw a movie in Dolby Cinema. I've only noticed this during my last two visits, but the leg rests on the recliners have been too low to be very comfortable for me. I find myself raising & lowering the leg rests throughout the show. I'm unusually tall, so my experience may not be typical.</review>

Good place for movie and food.
High risk area for windows breaking in cases. Be aware!
Even though this area is heavily patrolled by police and security but people still get their windshield smashed< /Text>

This visit was pretty good
They are currently in the middle of a major renovation, but they are doing a good job of keeping the impact to patrons to minimum. The only that is inconvenient is the parking lot, but that's more of a property owner issue not the theaters.<//text>

Popcorn was left out at concession stand instead of getting scooped fresh for you. Food offerings aren't worth the price you pay. All in all a disappointing visit to this theater which used to be much better. 😥< /Text>

<review>WARNING....Be very aware of your surroundings when parking in the shopping center. I was parked there during daylight hours. In front of the Krispy Kreme and panda stores. I parked close to the doors and by a street light so that if I came back after the sun went down that I would still have the light. When I came back to the car, thieves had broken the back door window and taken some of my belongings.  When I reported it to the police I was told there isn't any surveillance cameras and that I will never recover my stuff.  The police officers said it happens all the time.  Sometimes an entire row of parked cars will be vandalized.</review>< Pictures>

Good place too watch a movie with IMAX. Seats are not quite as comfortable as the newest that rotate forward, but OK. IMAX crashed today during the new Star Wars movie. First time that's happened to me. They had to reboot the system and start over, but gave us passes for a free movie in the future. Good variety of snacks, but pricy.<//Review>

I spent 6 hours looking, searching  for several things in TJMAXX. From a formal Black  Tie Ball Grown to Microwave Coffee Mugs, Pie Shields, Pjs to Houseware Sideboard Side dishes Plates. As well as Grocery Plastic bags storage containers to Marble Table Coasters, Cooking Spices an All-Clad A Gratin Casserole Oval Pan( I need one more to complete the set of two, now eagerly on the hunt to another, TJMAXX, HOMEGOODS or MARSHALLS. Hunt, Covent & Acquire.) My future Buttermilk Pancakes needed Old Fashioned Butter Pecan Syrup and Walkers Famous Shortbread Cookies to soothe the late night, nightly cookie habit I maintain. Lastly, but less on my list two Career choices a Wool Duster & a additional Contemporary Wool Motorcycle Jacket both of impeccably style & tailoring for today's modern executive. What an eventful, highly pleasurable shopping experience. Thank you, TJMAXX!!</review>
