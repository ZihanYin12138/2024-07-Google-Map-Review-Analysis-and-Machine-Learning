<Text>New Sushi joint just opened across from Rancho16 theatres, Arigato Sushi. The mango-banana roll is truly  a dessert role. Give it a  try for a sweet treat. The decor is simple yet lively. The chef prepared a courtesy sample of his BBQ sushi; a yummy creation. Dragon Sushi is our go to spot but Arigato is a close second.  Look at that cut of salmon nigiri...and the slice of avacado on the tuna is pure class. 😳 Stay tuned for future visit updates...< /Text>< Pics>

A little delayed in service but it's expected at such a small place that family owned. Saw a group of 25 walk in and get seated but they were complaining about the lag. Understandably in such a large party with 15 individual checks there may be a delay. Will definitely be back when we're on town again< /text>< Rating>

<Review>Best sushi in the valley!!! I am an avid sashimi nom nomer and have been to several spots out here but Arigato is hands down the best! Fish so fresh and the salmon sashimi just melts in your mouth. They play the best music videos too!<//Review>< rating>

Got an alert from Yelp! on this hot new restaurant. We received great service and the food was great.  The rolls start around $6 and for the fancier rolls around $12.  It is a very cozy atmosphere.  Hopefully the word gets out on this new place.<//text>

Just a few people when I went, but overall a great atmosphere. The waiter who served me first needs practice and the lady who server me later in the day was pretty good but needs to be more thorough. The food was also above average with an amazing portion size.< /review>

<rate>1<//rate><review>We walked in and we were overcome by the heat. The ac must have been out. Only a couple people in the place.  Should have been a red flag. But wanted to give it a shot. WRONG MOVE!  Had tasteless yellowtail, a spice-less spicy tuna roll that was very small.  And a baked lobster roll that we didn’t finish because it just tasted nasty.  Not sure where all these glowing reviews came from, guess you can’t go by what they say. Place and food was a disaster!<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< Gmap_id>

<review>Walked in to place a to-go order. Extremely dead in the restaurant with only 2 tables being occupied. I was not greeted and had to find the server. It took 40 minutes to get my food and it was super dead. They prioritize dine in orders before to-go ones. Never coming back again. This is atrocious. I do not recommend.<//review><date>1555475675183< /date><rate>1< /rate>< user>

Just finished dinner here with some great sashimi, sushi rolls and sparkling sake. This place seems to working very hard to build an ongoing clientele, and their efforts made me want to help by sharing my experience. Their secret strategy appears to include great food, large portions, reasonable prices and lavish attention on the customer.  Seriously, the service and attention we received was well above your average night out and the 8 piece sashimi combo with 2 sushi rolls was fantastic with generous portions. My wife and my sister ordered a couple of tasty rolls and appetizers and we shared what turned out to be too much food. We enjoyed all we could eat and boxed tomorrow’s lunch with the rest. Walked away with a new favorite place in the valley.</text>

Excellent carpaccio plates. We had one tuna and one salmon,  and shared a slightly spicy edamame serving. One TV was playing a MTV like Japanese show... slightly annoying.   Service was also very good.<//Review>

First time here. Tried the Arigato something.  It was sashimi, with crab meat, serrano, fresh greens, and sauce.  Delicious!  Friendly staff too. Try it. Try their protein role too. It's made without rice.</Text>

<text>Great spot, was greeted by a friendly employee before I made it inside. Believe he was taking a break so I can give him props for representing the establishment even when he was not on the clock. They had plenty of stuff to choose from, unfortunately I was not able to find an item to purchase. Then again, if I wasn't just waiting for a pizza order from next door, I'm sure I would have had a different outcome.< /text><pictures>None< /pictures>< rate>

<text>Stopped in for the first time yesterday. Pretty cool spot. Wasnt looking for anything specific. Just browsing. I gave it one star due to the employee behind the counter. He blatantly talked negative about other local competition stores. Even threw in a few profanities. Very unprofessional in my opinion. You sir may have negative things to say about your competitors but you just lost a customer to them. Good day.<//text>< Pics>

<Review>Family run business. Customer service is excellent. They don’t follow you around trying to sell but if you have a question they are double time to answer and help make suggestions etc. also the store chihuahua is worth the visit alone. Dog is off the hook friendly gentle and just hangouts. Really cool store and nice atmosphere and have useable gear not just hundreds of used boots or sleeping bags/pads that have been there for years. Their prices are generous to and a lot of times if buying second hand and notice a flaw they will give a few bucks off even if the product is still in working order. Lastly the owner and his son work the store. While their hours are set them being a few min late or close early on a slow day isn’t normal but does happen which is understanble. Overall great store. Great selection. Great service and always on the up and up never trying to sell a fubar item or gear that is beyond dated for mondern use and also have new stuff in ever opportunity I go in.<//Review>< pictures>

Staff is great but the store is horrible. Messy & limited selection. Also air quality isn't great.
I have yet to find a store worthwhile here in central california.

Best store I have been to is in Medford oregon.</Text>

This is the place to go. Every time I go there I have a great time. Great bartenders, the friendliest customers. Pool tables, pinball, sports on seven or eight screens. Tell them Lester sent you.<//Review>

I went by the lounge one evening a few days back and found it to be alive with activity.

The lounge entrance is located in the south west corner of the central plaza, just south of the Blyue Rose Dance project.  It is across the breeze way from the tallac village beauty salon.< /review>

<Text>Decent dive bar to watch sports. They have a dart board a few pool tables, shuffle board and a couple of pin ball machines. It's located through a hallway so its hard to miss. The area did seem a bit sketchy as well as the parking and the bar had a slight mildew smell as others have said, not unbearable. Pretty average.< /Text>< Pictures>

It's always too loud, it has wood paneling and Naugahyde upholstery, a pinball machine, shuffleboard, and the faint odor of mildew and that's pretty much it. The regular bartender is such a nice lady, but it's just a local dive.<//review>< Pictures>

I am very impressed with Kearby, they have been our Dentists now for about 20 years. I would give them a 5 star rating without question under normal circumstances. My only concern is that I found out yesterday when I asked that some of them are not vaccinated against COVID. The vaccine is now available to everyone. This late in the pandemic it seems that there should be no health care worker that is not vaccinated.<//Review>

Hands down, Kearbey dental group is amazing. Everyone in the office is a professional. I was treated with respect and the work performed was high quality.  No corners were cut and communication with me was on point. I have had my teeth cleaned at several different places in town and Kearbey dental had the best experience with top notch quality. I am a happy and satisfied customer. Sincerely Daniel Strang.<//Review>

<Review>Had my teeth cleaned today.The ladies that took care of me today were wonderful. The office is short a hygienist and weren't able to schedule me for my first cleaning until October. They put me on a wait list for cancelations.  I was called in less than a week. Now my October appointment is my next cleaning.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmapID>

The care and people are top notch. I am very uncomfortable with going to the dentist and they made it as smooth as possible. They were very thorough and explained everything very clearly in a way that I could take in without being overwhelmed. We came up with a plan and I am actually looking forward to getting my long overdue work done. Highly recommend!<//Review>

< Review>
Ryan Kearbey and his dental assistant were very good with my seven year old. X rays and cleaning top notch. I’m not a big fan of fluoride varnish and the assistant didn't ask me if it was okay to put it on. But besides that definitely going back for our sixth month check up! And I’m looking forward for my appointment as well. 😊</Review>

Their office is easy to find in a convenient location in town. I only wait a few minutes for my appointment. The hygienist was gentle and attentive when I told her I had some increased sensitivity. The office is very clean and modern. There is always a staff member ready to answer my questions quickly. They are friendly & professional. I would recommend Kearbey to my friends & family.</Review>

I've been going to Kearbey Dental for over 15 years. They are all so professional  and very yet makes me feel comfortable and almost like family. I always recommend them to all of my employees.< /text>

<text>I had a very pleasant, positive experience my first time at Kearbey Dental Group. Beginning with the first young lady I saw at the front desk to Dr Ryan to Amanda and Katelyn. Everyone was extremely friendly and professional.  They took the time to listen to any concerns. They were very gentle and caring and genuinely concerned about my comfort.
I am very happy I found them for my dental needs.<//text>< Response>

Dr. Ryan has great communication skills and is very personable with a sense of humor. He gave me all the available options of what needed to be done & why, & what wasn't feasible. Would have saved a lot of money had I started out with him. He will be my dentist from here on out, with what teeth I have left.<//text>

I had two extractions from Dr.Ryan. The first one was a breeze painless and so fast. The second was a bit rough, but he made sure the procedure would be done as painless as possible! He succeeded! I highly recommend him. P.s His staff members are all so sweet.</Review>

This was our first visit, but the dentist and assistant were efficient and quick - but the good kind of quick that shows they are good at their jobs, not the rushed kind of quick. The front desk staff was very accommodating setting up multiple future appointments as I tried to determine a schedule that worked for my family.<//Review>

Thank you all for your gental work and sweet words you say to us. You all rock from the girls behind the desk to the girls who talk us to the chairs to the girls who clean our teeth and to both Dr. Bob and Dr. Ryan. Thank you for all you do for us. We are glad you are here for us.

I would recommend Kearbey Dental time and time again. I came in with a complicated issue and Dr. Ryan has been so patient each and every time. His knowledge and bedside manner are exemplary. The staff is gentle and kind at each and every visit. Being able to walk into your appointment and having your doctor know who you are without having to read through notes or have his assistant remind him is top-notch in my book. Thank you Dr. Ryan and staff for taking care of my problem and always making me feel confident with my care!< /Review>

Easy and quick reception.  Did not keep me waiting.  I had lost a part of a filling - Amanda the dental assistant was pleasant and professional as she shot X-Ray and then “photographed” the broken tooth with a very cool devise that provided a complete contour of the tooth.  I decided to go with a new crown, and the photo allowed Dr.  Kearbey (Ryan) to manufacture the crown on-sit in about one hour. Dr. Kearbey was excellent, the procedure was painless (really!).  I walked out same day with a new tooth (crown) and went out to dinner that night.  No problems.  Would I recommend Kearbey Dental?  Absolutely!</Text>

The dentist is good but the staff can’t figure out how to make and keep a scheduled appointment to save there lives. They changed and canceled my family’s appointments all the time. And when I said this is getting ridiculous they don’t seam to care at all. I have worked in the service industry for the last 20 years and they could use a lesson or two on how you deal with an unhappy customer... Moving on.</review>

<Text>Dr Ryan is the best ..
They pulled 4 teeth and fix 5 other teeth.
Plus I accidentally bit the doctors fingers.
Oh my felt so bad.
Dr Ryan is the most professional dentist I've ever encountered.
If you ever need work done ask for Doctor Ryan.
Thank you Kirby Dental

Great crew down there at their very nice dentist office. I haven't been to dentist since like 1976, I haven't had dental insurance and when I did I was scared to go because of what they might find and the pain I remember as a kid. The total opposite was my experience, only had X-rays and a little grinding of a broken tooth so far but I felt very comfortable. Dr. Ryan seems to be a great dentist so far. I will report back once I have some real work done.< /Text>

<Text>Dr. Ryan is the best. My old dentist retired and the Dr. that took over his practice was awful. He did three fillings and six months later he told me I needed five more fillings. I didn’t really like the guy, he was kinda rude, so I thought it was time to switch to a new dentist. I had heard great things about Kearbey dental, so I scheduled the appointment. Dr. Ryan took a look and told me he saw absolutely no need for fillings. He noticed a few troubled spots that he wanted to keep an eye on, but didn’t want to do anything about it unless absolutely necessary. I’ve complained about a few minor things and Dr. Ryan has told me that there isn’t any serious damage to be repaired and has actively advised me to avoid unnecessary dental work. It’s so refreshing to work with a dentist who genuinely cares about me and my dental health and isn’t just interested in my insurance money. Dr. Ryan is absolutely the best and I wouldn’t consider ever changing to another dentist.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Kearbey Dental Group has always done well by both myself and my wife. They are kind and caring, and I have never had a concern about any of the work that they have done on me, and what included implants and a denture to snap onto the implants. It has been over 3 years since having the work done, and they are still very comfortable.<//Review>

This office is amazing, everyone is so nice and caring.  The girls at the desk know the patients by name and greet you every time you walk thru the door.  Before any procedure is performed everything is explained, there are no surprises.  Also they make crowns on site, so grateful for that service, I didn’t have to lose more rime from work to come back for a second appointment. I really can’t say enough good things.<//Text>

Wow I was impressed they were very professional and caring and clean. When I was done with my dental work they offered me the kitty bag with the toothpaste and toothbrush yes I took it to give it to my son to let him know what hes getting when he's finished with his dental appointment.

I’ve had a wonderful experience at Kearbey Dental Group. This has been my 3rd ( possibly 4th?)cleaning with April and it  has all been great. Professional and not too harsh and with her help we have reduced sensitivity on those problem teeth. Cheyenne did my polishing and pre cleaning etc this time and she was great and professional as well and asked about sensitive teeth as well. I don’t recall the previous pre cleaning girls’ name but she was great as well. Reception area staff / front desk Friendly and again professional. Great overall experience and I highly recommend this Group.</Review>

<text>A very quick process to establish care. I thought when I was told Dr Ryan would be seeing me in “a couple minutes”, it would be akin to ampla health and I’d be there the next hour. I don’t think I could have counted to 120, and he was there! The facility was clean, I was in and out in less than half an hour, and everyone was very professional and kind. Payment options were discussed in a low pressure way.< /text></record>

I love the hygienists that work here, softest flossing I’ve ever had done. Had my wisdom teeth pulled through them a few months back and it was an overall great experience.<//Review>

< review>
Kearbey Dental, Dr. Bob, Dr. Ryan and the staff, may it be the one assisting in the back or in the front or cleaning your teeth, are best in Butte County and surrounding areas! They are not only taking care of your dental needs, no they are also very sensitive to your pain levels and anxiety needs. They except most insurances but take the good old money and have understanding when you have to save money for your treatment too. It is coming to part of your family as they greet you by your name before you even mention yours. They are very friendly and upbeat and call you with a reminder for your appointments which I personally appreciate very much and your teeth cleaning appointments are scheduled every 3-6 months ahead so you know when it is your next turn.
Buy the way, if you have a TMJ problem, Dr. Bob specializes in cases such as that. Give him a call and schedule yours, I will schedule mine in the next 5 weeks.
A Happy and Satisfied

The staff are really friendly. You hardly ever have to wait pass your appointment time and they let you know if you need work done on your teeth or not. The staff are welling to find out how much it would cost you out of pocket if you do need work done and what’s not covered by your insurance.<//review>

I am no longer apprehensive about going to the dentist to get my teeth cleaned. The staff at  Kearbey Dental Group put me at ease from the moment I walked in the office to make an appointment. Each one is a professional, courteous and friendly. I love they way all of the dental components are hidden away until they are needed. Today was my second visit and I am going to tell everyone I know to switch to Kearbey Dental Group. Thanks Dana and Karen for your services today.<//Text>

<Text>A tooth fell out of my denture over the weekend.  I took it into Kearbey Dental Group first thing.  They were able to fix it the same day.  We are lucky to have a dental office in Oroville, where one can get things like this fixed without being without your denture for days.  I have been going to Kearbey Dental for over 25 years now and they have always been professional, fast and courteous.  I highly recommend them.<//Text>< resp>

We lost our dentist in Paradise due to the fire so this was our first time at Kearby Dental Group and we couldn't be happier about chosing them. The front staff were great. Fiona was kind and helpful and Dr. Bob was a hoot. We look forward to many years here.<//Review>

<text>As always I had a terrific time at Kearbey Dental Group at 2690 Olive Hwy in Oroville. And you would.have never heard me saying something like that about my experience at a dentist office because I am a dentist “chicken”. If I fear something it is the dentist - but not Dr. Bob or Dr. Ryan. But I speak about Kearbey Dental Group and they are fantastic. They do what is needed, never something what is not necessary and they have the friendliest staff around. They acknowledge you right away, remember things from the last visit and talk to you about it. I am definitely looking forward to get my next dental procedure done and just have to see how I can work it into my schedule. I recommend Kearbey Dental Group. Sincerely Elisabeth(Liz) Jorgensen< /text>< pictures>

<Review>Donna Nickelson, here.
My experience of Kearby Dental is superb. Dr. Bob and all of the dentists are top notch, efficient, knowledgeable and pleasant! The staff and hygienists are positive and so very helpful. Going to my dentist is an appointment to be desired. I highly recommend Kearby Dental!< /Review>< UserId.>

I love Kearby  dental group. They are all professional, timely, and friendly. I have never been happier with a dentist. Dr. Ryan completes his crowns in one visit which saves me from having to take time off work. I knocked a front tooth out in high school and Dr. Ryan is the first dentist to ever make me a crown that looked like a natural tooth. I couldn’t be happier with a dental office. 😊<//text>

I had my two front top teeth crowned. I was a little apprehensive but
am glad to see they look just like the one’s I was born with. As always ,
I couldn’t be happier with Dr. Bob and his staff.<//Text>< time>

Shyan started my flossing and cleaning before Rylie the hygienist came in and she was very professional she made sure I was comfortable. As for Rylie she is highly intelligent at what she does. She always has new techniques for me to better my oral hygiene. I’ve never felt more comfortable then at Kearbey Dental Group.<//review>

< review>
I saw the dentist and told him my front tooth that needed a root canal was hurting all the time. The experience as a whole seemed impersonal and built on breakdown of cost and not truly treating the patient. I prefer Ampla. The Ampla health dentist was empathetic and I was placed on antibiotics and a filler for the tooth needing a root canal. Kearby dental is a cookie cutter type of practice.
I also felt Kearby dental was trying to push too hard to obtain me as a patient. Stating the dental benefit piece would get too confusing if I only wanted a root canal and to have other work done by my dentist.
Needless to say....please cancel my appt on Tuesday 🦷< /review>

<Review>Kearby Dental is the best Dental Group in the area. Almost afraid to post too good of a revuew because it's so personable now that if their client base increases too much I'm afraid it might take away from the experience now. Lol. They did have to reschedule me yesterday because of how busy they get, but I was surprised that what I told the lady on the phone transferred to my dental hygienist. I told them I had another appointment after the rescheduled slot. Usually at most places you get a fake nod and ok and hang up. When I showed up, I was surprised they passed the message on to the rest of the staff to ensure I get out on time. It's one of my pet peeves at hospitals when shifts change and the next nurse doesn't know what the last nurse has been working with you on. Not here. Customer service is excellent from a to z. Always a friendly environment. Shout out to Dana and Sharon for always catching the bad spots I miss when brushing. They're a great team.</Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmapID>

I can admit it...I am a COWARD!  I have very sensitive teeth.  Kearby Dental Group has been my families dental home for more than a decade and I adore the people at Kearby Dental Group!  They are gentle, patient and very understanding. (Trust me, I am NOT an easy patient!  Feel free to ask them about me).  They walk me through every step of the process... from evaluation to planning to helping me figure out how to pay for it all.  I trust them enough that I even had Rhonda look over our options and help me pick out our insurance plan!  I appreciate the extra time and effort that they put into making our families dental experiences healthy and positive.</review>

<Review>Cannot say enough good things about Finance of America, but more specifically Mark Martinez and his assistant Gloria Paine. They mean business and I respect them so much. They have helped me with two transactions now: my initial purchase through a first time buyer CalFHA program/loans, and now a refinance. Mark and his team are quick, knowledgeable, professional, and amazing. I am never the type to write reviews, but I value Mark, Gloria, and FOA. 10/10 would recommend to anyone without hesitation. Mark will be the first person I contact whenever I am in the market again.< /Review>< pictures>

<review>We have had the privilege of working with Jim on several occasions, with the purchase of our first home a few years ago, and with the refinance of our home twice.  Jim is a person that can be trusted.  He is  very knowledgeable in his field, and answered all of our questions in a way that we could understand.  He was always willing to answer our questions.  We highly recommend Jim.<//review></record></dataset><record>

Comment:
If I could sum up the experience with Finance of America in one word, I would say "Responsiveness". Ms. Patricia Redfern-Wright took immediate ownership when we approached her with regards to our home refinancing, and she responded to our request in a highly professional, caring, engaging, transparent, and expeditious way. Ms. Patricia managed our expectations from the get-go and made sure our concerns were attended to without delays or hesitation. Many thanks. Y. Said< /review>

Worked with Patricia on the purchase of a home for a client. She was a consummate professional and a true pleasure to work with. She was calm, responsive, and highly knowledgeable, all while handling a very challening transaction. I'd sincerely welcome the opportunity to work with her again on another occasion down the line and would highly recommend her to anyone seeking a competent lender.<//review>

There were no surprises at the time of closing.  Mario answered all our questions even though I confirmed with him multiple times. He also kept us ahead of schedule during the home. I strongly recommend Mario Pierce not only to friends and family but to everyone looking for a mortgage loans.</Review></record>

<Text>I can not speak highly enough about Mark and his staff! I used them to purchase my first home on my own after a divorce a few years back. Then came around a few years later and refinanced my home with them as well. I was able to lower my payment significantly and appreciate Mark and Gloria soo much! They were very patient, clear and swift with the whole process. I would highly recommend them to anyone!</Text></record></dataset><record>
<text>Lynn Nelson was our mortgage lender.  She was on top of everything, super organized and very responsive. She helped us from start to finish of the loan process and made is super helpful to just have to be in contact with one person. She made sure to walk through every step of the loan process with us so that we understand everything that was going on. If we were confused or had a question, we would call her and she would also respond quickly. She explored all loan options for us and help us get the best rate and loan possible. I would love to work with Lynn and her entire team again in the future!</text><Resp>None<//Resp><UserId.>106943622343517547642</UserId.><rating>5</rating>< pics>

Jim helped us five years ago to buy our house when I was retired with no job! Now, as he kept in touch, Jim helped with the refinance attempt while I am semi-retired with a couple of part time jobs.

Jim's knowledge of this field is invaluable and his approach and availability are exemplary!

His professionalism and expertise as an asset to any loan application throughout the process to the completion of the loan process. My better half and I recommend Jim without reservation.< /Review>

I was sincerely blown away by the level of service Anila Whitney provided. She took what is a very stressful process and made it as smooth as possible. Highly available, excellent communication and knowledge. Pushed very hard to get our loan through in time despite complications. I am so grateful to have connected with Anila, not only terrific to work with but genuinely an amazing person. Thank you so very much!< /Text>

I contacted Alan to request information on the possibility to refinance and pay off my Hero loan.  He answered immediately and we began the process in no time.  The process to refinance was smooth and stress free.   I highly recommend Alan for his professionalism, trustworthiness, and knowledge.  My Hero loan has been paid and my mortgage payment is very reasonable.   Thank you!<//text>

My family and I presently own our home due to Mark and his staffs hard work. We met him seven years ago when we were in an impossible situation and Mark pulled us out of a nightmare. Mark and his staff are perhaps the best mortgage finance company in all of Southern California.
Thanks again for being there for our family.

They walked us through the process and Ron, our agent would go out of his way to always answer our questions and take us to go home viewing. They explained paper work needed and felt we were in good hands with them. I highly recommend Patricia Redfern-Wright and her team to guide you through the home buying process as it could be a very stressful experience if not helped out properly, but with Patricia, Ron and her team we got our dream home and are very pleased and happy. We knew that they would get us our dream home.</review>< pictures>

<user>117278999184821325530< /user><rating>1< /rating><review>Cox has become the absolute worst in internet service and customer service.  They are illegally throttling internet speeds because they are too cheap to upgrade by adding nodes to their service.  Gigablast service is nonexistent as they continue to throttle speeds.  Supervisor Zach hung up the phone when asked why this is being done.  Service technician came out and of course they made sure service was great for one day and then 24 hours later began throttling speeds again to the point where the internet service is so slow in the evening it’s useless.  Service was out for two days and now they have the nerve to ask customers to pay in advance before the end of the service cycle.  The Attorney General will be receiving a formal complaint.  This needs to stop.  Any Cox user experiencing the same I recommend uniting and filing complaints as well.</review><Response>None</Response>< name>

Agent was mostly unhelpful, first said signal was fine, then said signal was “troubled,” when I suggested there might be a problem with the connection to the house from Cox, agent suggested it was the modem (which is new), and another neighbor called after I posted on a local neighborhood app asking if anybody had any problems and said she did. I mentioned that to the agent and they didn’t even address it. Instead, agent tried up-selling me, scheduled a tech to show up three days later “in case the problem still persists,” and put me on a waiting list to see “if they could get someone out sooner.” Guess my kid won’t be doing virtual school on Monday.  Cox used to have stellar support, alas, no more. This complaint is all about support; when the internet works, the speeds are good, but when there is a problem, they are terrible at dealing with it.</text>

The absolute worst internet you can ever buy. Paying for 150m getting a bouncy 56m. Worst customer service couldn’t rate this provider any lower. I wouldn’t even recommend it to so someone I hate just because Cox would profit from it!</Text>

I don’t know about this location personally, but Cox Communications is absolutely horrible and I would 100% recommend avoiding them if possible. Our internet is horrendous given the speeds we pay for at more expensive rates. The prices are rising and the services are declining. Their customer support is horrible, and they always seem to blame their mistakes on my end. The internet is at times not even usable. If I could switch to another provider (such as AT&T), I 100% would. Unfortunately, Cox has a monopoly where I live so there is no other option to turn to than their overpriced, horrible internet connectivity. If you can, AVOID this company, you’ll actually be able to enjoy some high internet speeds at a much cheaper price.</Text>

<Review>Cox customer service is poor , they add extra fees to your monthly bill and lie about contracts . Especially during covid -19 I thought I would have a better experience but I keep having added charges and building anxiety about my next bill . Just not worth taking a chance on them , go with another company<//Review>< Rate>

This is the worst internet service I’ve experienced in my entire life. I honestly can’t wait to leave San Diego just so that I have more options. My phones cellular hot spot is more reliable then Cox. Why did I even spend a year paying for this sub par service. DO BETTER COX.</Review>

<Review>Just moved to California and I’ve had this service for two months it’s literally been the worst service that we’ve ever had… We have the fastest Internet and I work from home I was never told that here you go by data amounts
After I told him my needs I ended up getting a bill for twice the amount because we went over our data and they said that that wouldn’t happen and we wouldn’t have to worry about that.  The Internet never worked and we just got tired of having issues every single day literally with it!
Worse experience EVER!<//Review>< pics>

<Review>Had to change out my old cable box for the Contour box. I have had NOTHING but trouble! For the past 4 months I have had to call Cox every 2 weeks or more. The techs have had to reboot my box every time. The representatives are helpful and caring but the product is less than poor. I have been a Cox customer for over 25 years. I may have to quit them! 😔<//Review><GmapID>0x80d9524b26e422d7:0xb60028b679f0c73f< /GmapID>< Response>

Cox Communications has the worst customer service ever! They even burned me for $130.00 in total!!
Don't fall for their 30 day money back guarantee because you won't ever get your money back!! No matter what! They will come up with some excuse as to where the money went.
They definitely don't stand behind their word that's for sure! It's unfortunate for them because I loved the cable service and would have taken them with me when we moved but didn't have service in our area not only that!  It's more about the money that they took from me!! Especially since their supervisor told me that the check was in the mail and it was definitely on it's way and should get to me in the next couple of weeks.
Well she lied!!  Because after not receiving the check after waiting for more than 2 weeks I called them back and of course I was told that they decided to just keep my money! They literally just took my money!! 😡 So for that reason not only would I not recommend them but I will warn everyone by leaving reviews everywhere on every social media site so that people know exactly what they are getting into when they become a Cox Communications customer.  Unfortunately Cox communications is one of the worst companies I've dealt with when it comes to their customer service!
Having to deal with their so called supervisor who just lies to their customers just shows you what kind of incompetence they really have and what kind of company they are!
It's too bad too because like I said it was one of the best cable companies in the area but because of their customer service I would have given them a big fat zero on the star chart but unfortunately they don't have a zero option but if I could give it a zero Star rating then I would have. I mean for a single disabled mom I need every dollar just to survive and now because their supervisor literally lied to me about the money now I won't be. Do NOT go to Cox for your cable service. They are a terrible company! So save yourself the time and money.< /text>

<review>If I could give them no stars I would. Very unreliable. As a college student it is important that I have consistent internet service. My area always seems to have network outages which happens very randomly and can take hours to fix. When you call their representatives they’re not helpful whatsoever and don’t work towards finding a solution. My advice is to find a provider with better customer service and reliable services.</review></record>

For the past 2 years I have had one problem after another with my cable TV both in my living  room and my bedroom.  There have been at least 8 plus different cox cable technicians including the contractors they hire come to my home to "troubleshoot" the cable issues.  Their solution IS ALWAYS to switch cable boxes. To date I have had 5 different cable boxes within the past year. The latest have been twice this week alone, including today. Guess what....I AM STILL HAVING CABLE ISSUES.  Not one of these technicians were able to fix two major cable problems & NOT ONE OF THEM bother to listen to the issues.
I hope someone (preferably with a brain) from COX cable contacts me to get these issues resolved.< /text>

<Text>I don't even know why I decided to go with cox once again after all the bad experiences we had. I got a "promotion" of gigablast of 99.00 plus I want to believe the equipment which ends up in 111.38 plus 20.00 kit activation. Hold on now I didn't even get a print out or any explanation of all this charges in paper I left from that store with out a receipt or not even an account number just the equipment. What if I have an issue how am I supposed to let them know from what account especially when the unit above has an account already. Yes we ended up having an issue the guy swore there was a connection already so there shouldn't be an issue setting it up. Lies we come home and try to set it up and there is not cable or anything coming from out from the apartment.  Oh gosh yesterday that I called the lady said if we purchased a 10.00 care kit it would cover the installation another lie not true we have to pay 55.00 on top of that. Anyways in total we have to pay 196.38 to get internet like seriously just for internet I am so angry right now and funny how they know they messed up because the call keeps being send around no one wants to help me or fix the issue. This company is nonsense they can't help at all and just sell you products they swear will help when at the end all they care about is selling to you to just get you to pay an unnecessary amount of money to them and the screw up ones are us because on top of that they won't take responsibility of a product that doesn't work. So DO NOT get internet from this company!!!< /Text>< Pictures>

I been a loyal customer for over 20years. On 1/21/19 I was offered a 1yr. Promotional Rate. I noticed my March 2019 bill increased $26 which was not the offed that was presented to me at that time.

When I called Cox to report my concerns, the representative and supervisor said the increased was due to taxes and area increased price. This was not once disclosed to me on 1/21/19. I find this to be very upsetting and unprofessional. It's a Bait and Switch tactic.

I will be reporting my experience to the BBB and Social Media to Boycott Cox Communications until I receive the customer service I deserve.< /text>

<Review>Worst internet provider I have ever had... took 3 weeks to install after 4 failed attempts. Then continued to overcharge me for 3 months. Use anyone else if you have the option. Also, if you actually need anything you have to request a "in house technician" or they send someone who is a random contractor who has no access to Cox internal info.<//Review>< pictures>

< review>
The old man that runs this donut shop is the nicest business owner ever. He's always chatting up his customers, giving away free donuts, or just beaming a smile.

My family and I come to this shop not just because it's the closest shop to our home but honestly because the taste is fantastic here and the customer service can't be beat compared to every other donut shop in the area.

Donuts here are fresh and not too sweet or tasteless. The dough is always fluffy and the icing on the donuts are perfect. Other places taste kind of fake and leave a waxy texture coating the roof of your mouth but these donuts are always great. I've never had a bad one here. Honestly the best donut shop in Stockton.

The shop is a little older but it's always clean. I'm not sure what happened to the other reviewer who said it was dirty but as a clean freak, I've never felt grossed out here. It's just an older establishment, but the shop itself is really clean.</review>

<text>We've  gotten doughnuts here a handful of times. Because of its location we often forget about it but the quality of doughnuts is without question. Obviously handmade fresh. Just the right amount of sweetness. Not overly sweet like the giant chain or grocery store bakery. There are a handful of GREAT doughnut shops in Stockton. This is among them as far as quality of products. Even though the atmosphere is severely lacking.<//text><response>None< /response></record>

<Review>I love Sally's I shop there so much I'll have like 5 reviews stack up at one time. I can find any thing I need for my hair in one place. I'm a natural 4c girl if that helps.<//Review>< Pictures>

< Review>
Fine place, fine people, well organized. The stock is rotated regularly, so you don't wind up with old expired product. They have loyalty cards, specials, good online service, great selection AND are prompt at getting special orders in stock. Their pricesare competitive with even the big-box stores. I find that if you need specific knowledge about product and technique it's best to go weekdays during business hours and to find one of the more experienced employees....there are one or two in particular at my locale who are VERY knowledgeable. They respect the customer's needs and their pocketbook. I have NEVER had anything less than a good experience, and they've never sent me away with more than I need.< /Review>

<text>This place is awesome Generally speaking. There are better locations as far as Attitude goes. I love how they exchange anything if you're not happy with it, like shampoo. The saying is true, Attitude is EVERYTHING! So to all Managers who are in charge of training should firmly stress to all employees the importance of friendliness first and foremost for the success of each establishment!< /text><rate>4<//rate><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMuoeE2_DaBZfPnBgknLbfMty854CcwffdMTIvK=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pictures><Time>1539324829826< /Time><Resp>None< /Resp><GmapID>0x80dca61debd41ae7:0x36de7854e5adc666<//GmapID>< user_name>

I love this Sally's store, the manager here is always so helpful. Today I went in to make an exchange, but I couldn't find my receipt, so this manager went into her computer and found it for me. She made the exchange for with no problem.<//text>

< Review>
HORRIBLE customer service. They claimed I could not use my 15% off coupon that expires today at midnight because it was expired or redeemed. Their clerk informed me that if I eas a Sally member there was posdibly a coupon and waited for me to open me email. She WATCHED me open up my email!!! When her register did not want to accept the coupon snd she asked her co-worker to help her over ride, the co worker called the manager and stated I probably already used my coupon. Seriously, the clerk is the one that prompted me to search my email. I clearly had not used it. I walked out of the store snd told her I would be contacting their corporate office for such ridiculous service!!< /Review>

I am so happy with my newly installed One Water System. I noticed the difference immediately. The water tastes great from all of the faucets my home. The dishes sparkle and my skin and hair have improved. I'm excited to see if my plants show some improvement. Kevin, the owner, and his staff have been great. Juan installed the system and was also fantastic. I couldn't be happier. Thank you!</text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><Text>I recently ad the One Water  system installed and my wife and I are extremely satisfied. The systems performs exactly as we were told it would by Ken. The system was installed very professionally and effectively.

There is a big difference when you take a shower. The water feels much better and the soap suds are much larger and softer.

My wife and I drink a lot of water, mainly bottled water, because our water did not taste good. Now our water tastes very good and we do not have to drink bottled water to be satisfied.

I highly recommend a One Water System to anyone who is dissatisfied with their current water system.

The One Water System gives us just what was promised.  Is it perfect?  No, no system is perfect.  There are trade offs with all systems.  I like that we get water with the chlorine and other harmful items taken out.  I like that it won’t clog our pipes and faucets and is maintenance free.  I miss the slick feeling we got with our old salt based system showering but that is minor.  We are very satisfied with this purchase. The< /text>

Our water is so clean and refreshing to drink. Hard water and bottle water gone, all tap water now! We have even noticed a bigger difference in our shower water. Love it.
The whole buying and install process was great. Salesman, Kevin showed up on time and walked us thru the whole process to understand their system vs others and the differences, never once talking bad about the competition. His knowledge and customer understanding really made this easy to decide. When the install day came the installer was great and worked with us to help fit the tank into a smaller cabinet space that was hard to get into. Finally the follow up call on our service and experience was perfect to top it off.
My wife was skeptical at first but now is a believer on this system truly filtering and purifying the water. This is a company you can trust. Thank you for the great service and staff!< /text>< pictures>

Researching water filtration whole house systems, was extremely challenging until I spoke with Kevin at One Water.  He came to our home and explained everything and answered all of our questions.  The installation was scheduled and his technitian arrived on time and installed the system with no problems.  Our water now doesn't dry out our skin or hair.  I can use the water right from the tap for my two little dogs.  Everything seems to sparkle.  I would HIGHLY recommend One Water Water Filtration.  My friend put the under the sink model in and she is happy as well.< /review>

Great customer service. Both the representative and the installer were straight forward with the product compared to other water softener machine. They were able to stall the water softener system in a location in my garage out of the way accommodating my needs as a customer. Thank you.< /Review>

This is a wonderful Water System.  The water taste's great and I don't have to worry about my pipes or faucets having problems any more.  I would highly recommend this product .  Also the installation is done in a about 2-3 hours and the plumber was very nice and professional.</Text>

The Product is excellent, you will notice quickly how much better the water is on your skin, especially if family has skin issues. Now even our dog drinks the water, before we had a Salt/Potassium water softener for a decade but had to be cautious on various issues including inhaling the hot steam when taking a shower, I suggest people read up on the studies. Everyone was on time, all questions are answered. Installation was faster than expected. This is a very important investment not only for the home itself but for your family.

Keith was on time and very informative about the One Water System. He patiently answered all my questions and offered a no pressure fair price. Installation was scheduled five days later on a day and time of my choice with our installer Juan. Juan was also on time and very professional. In addition to installing the water system he also installed a new service valve and pressure regulator. In addition, he added a hose spigot at the One Water System location in my garage. Juan did a nice job of house keeping after the job was complete which I really appreciated. We’ve only been using the One Water System for a week now, but you can definitely feel and see the difference in the water. We are looking forward to see all the long term benefits.< /review>

The water tastes wonderful.  Not need for bottled water. I am using less soap and shampoo. I am sure it will keep my pipes and faucets clean and clear for a long time to come.</review>

<Text>The installer arrived on schedule but without all the proper materials to perform the installation.  Had to go to a parts warehouse for additional materials.  The home office didn’t provide all the information I had told the office when purchased.  System replaces a whole house system installed over 20 years ago.  They were required to replace the 1” line with a 1 1/4” line and that’s were the problem was I countered.  Installer was neat and clean during the install.< /Text><gmap_id>0x80dc710e9696417b:0x31e078bc492b351d<//gmap_id><rating>4<//rating>< pictures>

We are very pleased and enjoying the water from our One Water System. The installation was excellent and Juan even improved the pipes in the area of the old water softener.  Everything from Kevin, who is very knowledgeable about water, to Juan who installed it, we were in the good hands of professionals.< /text>

<Review>We had a different water system that was ancient and needed to be replaced. We did a lot of research and believe we made the right decision. The installation went flawlessly and Juan our installer was great. No miss no fuss and perfect water once again. We highly recommend One Water.<//Review>< Rating>

<Text>Excellent product and service at at good price. Kevin, the owner, came out and provided an overview of the filters and provided a competitive estimate before he left my home. Juan the Installer showed up at the scheduled time and placed the new filter exactly where I wanted.   Water tastes and feels so much better now.   One Water Systems is highly recommended!<//Text>< rate>

<Text>Kevin gave a thorough presentation that answered all our questions regarding whole house water systems. We researched this thoroughly and after tasting the water from every faucet in our home, feeling the difference on our skin and feeling relieved we have no more filters to ever buy, we are so glad we went with One Water.</Text>< Pics>

<rate>1</rate><Text>During the install the plumber literally soldered all the piping while it was attached to my wall and burned it.

When I contacted them about the damages Kevin seemed extremely apologetic and promised to get the issue fixed ASAP. I would be out of town in 11 days (original install 6/5 and would be out of down on 6/17). I was told that they would contact me the next day and everything would be sorted. When I spoke with Kevin the next day they didn't have any repair guys lined up yet but I was promised that they would have it fixed by my deadline. I informed Kevin I had no reason not to take his word for it but that I would propose he "put his money where his mouth is" and stand behind his promise. If he is able to repair it by that date no harm no foul, a mistake was made by his company, he owned it, stood behind his word and fixed the mistake in a timely fashion. But if he couldn't deliver after promising this then he should provide the system for free and I would pay for my own repairs. I was told that I was threatening him and the conversation was over and I was hung up on. I called back explained I wasn't threatening him and that my stance really is that you should stand behind your work. It seemed that we had an understanding and an agreement.

The next day we had a short chat around noon and Kevin explained that he was still looking for a painter for the repair but had sorted his plumber.  I texted him a couple hours later seeing if there was any update on the painter and never got a response.

The following morning I called on my way to work to see if there was any update. We had a very productive chat at which I proposed again that we have till 6/16 or 6/17 to finish the repairs at which point I'd be leaving town. Again he promised that it would be done and I said that I have no reason to doubt his word but again would want some kind of assurance placed behind it. We finished the conversation and I believed we had an agreement on that. I asked him to confirm the agreement via email but he indicated he was out of the office in LA.

I drafted the agreement in an email and sent it off to his office asking them for confirmation. They responded saying that wasn't the agreement and if they couldn't have it repaired by 6/17 they would take the machine back for a full refund. This wasn't my understanding so I called Kevin to try to sort it out.

During our conversation Kevin stated his concerns that I would try to nit pick him for damages well after the repairs were complete to try and get a free machine and "there was no way he would put any kind of agreement like that in writing". I indicated I just wanted an agreement put in place so both sides knew what we expected. I suggest we do an assessment together prior to the repairs and sign off at completion relieving them of all liabilities for damages from the install. Kevin seemed to agree with this and we finished another productive phone call. Shortly there after Kevin texted me saying that the repair people would be here on Saturday at 9am and the office would confirm with me.

I drafted an email with our agreement and shortly after I sent it, his office called to tell me the repair would be here at 8am Saturday morning. I informed of the time discrepancy and asked them to confirm the time and the email. They said they would get back to me shortly.

At 5pm I still haven't heard back so I call the office and Kevin and I leave a message.  ~2 hour later Kevin returns my call and I think we are on track to get everything sorted. When I ask for a written agreement I'm asked what else do I need in writing and isn't his word enough. When I press for a written agreement I'm told "I don't want you as a customer" and we will remove your system Saturday.

I get an email ~9pm that night saying they will be here Saturday morning to remove the system and that should be the confirmation. with no service agreement I've proposed I find my own people who will invoice them in addition to the full refund. I will update when this is resolved.<//Text>< Pictures>

It's a nice park with 2 Pokémon go gyms. The park itself has a large spacious soccer and baseball field. It has a small playground area but lots of space for potatoes and other activities.<//text>

Cool park to play some baseball but theirs not much lights at night for safety in the parking lot. And it's next to some ghetto apartments and there's always people from the apartments smoking or drinking in the parking lot of the park. Playground is small and has uneven dirt/sand.</text>

< Review>
If you are looking for a new dentist for your babies, this is the place!!!! I HIGHLY recommend you bring your children here.  The staff here is amazing!  My son, who was just along for the ride today, was amazed at all the hand painted art on the walls and all the drawings on the chalk walls! They even let him have a toy when my daughter's appointment was over!

The staff here is amazing! This was our first time here, and unfortunately probably our last(due to insurance) , but, the staff is extremely friendly, respectful and helpful, and I honestly felt like they cared about my baby girls well-being. Despite being a new patient, the appointment was so quick! Usually, even with an appointment I've got the bad luck of having to wait passed my appointment time to be seen. Not here though!!

The Dentist we saw, (I don't remember his name, but I really wish I did!) He was amazing! This dentist unfortunately does not accept my insurance, and for my daughter's specific needs, she cannot wait until August for what is required. However, this place still gets 5 stars because they went above and beyond to help me with my baby girl and they referred me to a couple great places that accept our type of insurance!!  They gave me great advice, and were very friendly, understanding, and professional.

I HIGHLY recommend you  bring your children here to be seen. You will not regret it!<//Review>

Hercules Children's Dentistry is by far the best facility I have ever visited with my girls. I have a 7 year old and she loves coming to her dental visits. My 3 year old, not so much, but the staff makes her feel comfortable and eventually she lets them proceed with the visit. We have been coming here for about 5 years and the vibe in the office is so cool. There are neat drawings everywhere and its super kid friendly ! Keep up the great work guys! We will see you soon!<//text>

<text>First visit to the office was great experience. Every one was polite and kids friendly. Very clean space.

I'd recommend to cover the bench where kids lay down for exam with reusable thin layer or use non toxic spray to kill germs on contact. I didn't see the bench being wiped for next customer after my son's examination. They might or might not spray and wipe but it's necessary to point out its important to ward off germs.

Overall my son liked the vibe, colorful blackboard decorated with fun dental messages is definitely eye catching. Another blackboard for kids to write or draw would be fantastic.

Keep up the good work.</text><Time>1620855101653</Time></record>

Always a pleasant visit. My daughter is 4 and has been going here since she was 2. She absolutely loves the doc and staff. I'm so glad her experience has been good. She never has a problem going to the dentist so I'm happy about that.<//Review>

Hercules Kids Dentistry is the best pediatric dental office! Both the doctors are very thorough, patient and amazing with kids! My daughter has had to get a couple of fillings and they have ensured that her experience is positive and successful, working within the pace for her age and maturity. The staff is also very warm and helpful. To top it off, the office is beautiful! It's a very warm and inviting place for kids (and adults). I am so happy to have found this dental office for our family.<//Review>

I am so happy we found this dental office. We drive from Vallejo to come here. The office is really clean, the receptionist always greets us with a smile and makes us feel welcome. We usually have the dental assistant Leslie and she is always very sweet and gentle with my kids. The doctor as well. If you are looking for a friendly dentist to take you children this is the place. We have had terrible experiences with children’s dentist in the past. So happy we found a dentist my kids enjoy.<//review>

The staff was friendly and informative.The dental assistant was friendly and professional, and the dentist was also friendly and professional. The dentist was very nice and reassuring, and was understanding of my son screaming and crying(it was his first ever visit and also has a lot of stranger danger.He doesn’t like anyone but me). We will definitely be back.My daughter was brave and had a great time and they even let her use the tools! She was so happy. Thank you.<//Review>

Both I and my 4 and 5 year old left knowing we were well informed and they had fun. The office is for real dentistry with that effect but it has the frills and comfort features that helped the children enjoy the visit. What I liked most about it was the care the staff put into making sure all my options for care and billing were explained and that I fully understood them. Thank you.

I love this place. It’s clean, modern and the staff is really nice. They are efficient and fast. The TVs and decor really keeps the children occupied and it’s not a drag to visit the dentist. The dr. is great with kids and always asks questions to keep them engaged. He is well spoken and easy to understand when he speaks to you and your child if they are able to communicate. If you need surgical work he doesn’t just recommend they set you up with an appt. in San Jose which will do this so insurance is fully covered and then you return back to them for your regular check ups, etc. They made that 1 transition extremely easy and I’ve been with them for 3 years now and plan to bring my newborn (when of age to visit) there as well. Thanks 😊 for serving our community, we are glad you are here!< /text>

I was scared my 1 year old wouldn’t let them do their job because she fights me when it comes to brushing her teeth. She did an excellent job and did not require any forceful treatment. Staff are all very friendly and helpful. My 5 year old also loves going to this dental office.<//text>

All the staff members are so welcoming every visit. I have 3 children that come to this dentist and at first my kids were horrible to the dentist trying to bit they spit everything you can image but all out of fear. The dentist did not give up and now 4 years later my kids love the dentist and they actually look forward to going get their teeth cleaned and xrayed (I think it cause they get toys and a new tooth brush).
I would definitely recommend this dentist to any human that has a child. I am a Hercules kid dentistry fan and they are all extended family.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808576cfcd2c85d1:0xf0b93bfa904b05c4<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

<text>Best staff and office for kids!
This is our second time taking our two boys, 6 and 2 1/2 to this dentist and they've been consistent with their treatment of the boys. The dental assistants are respectful of both the boy's personality differences and the brother and sister dentist team are awesome with them! Best experience so far 👌 😊</text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x808576cfcd2c85d1:0xf0b93bfa904b05c4</GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Quick, efficient, and following all current regulations and guidelines. Both kids felt comfortable (minus my son freaking out being placed on his back-but the dentist did not get agitated when my son cried which was very comforting) with the dentist and staff who were all very friendly and nice. Excited to have found a new, reliable dentist office for my children.</Review>

We absolutely love love Hercules Kids Dentistry! Their staff is amazing and so accommodating. We love them and am so pleased that our kids look forward to going to the dentist.

Besides the amazing dentist, we absolutely love each and every one of the dental hygienists! They love on the kids and explain with joy what they’re going to do & explain in detail the tools they’re using. Can’t wait to see them in 6 months!< /Review>

<Review>I never imagined that my three year old would enjoy going to the dentist! The hygienists are so kind and gentle and Dr. Bala is very engaging and funny, making the kids feel so comfortable and safe. The new protocols in place for your appointment during these Covid times are very reasonable and good. I had no concerns about our visit.< /Review>< username>

The office is upscale with TV monitors over the dental chair to keep the children occupied. My child had a wonderful experience. The RDA was flawless with polishing the teeth. The atmosphere was very kid friendly and they utilized strict Covid protocol. The Dr was very nice with awesome chair side manor. I am happy that Orthoworks in Hercules referred me to this office.<//Text>

Staff is friendly and welcoming,  the visit was fast and it wasn't scary to my kid. They were very cautious following the covid 19 guidelines. At the end if the visit, my 4 year old girl was very happy with her 2 gifts; a little toy and new toothbrush. Thank you for the great service.</Text>

I can now say my daughter likes going to the dentist! she had a bad experience previous to finding Hercules kids dentistry. Because of this reason she was always difficult to treat but they have always been so patient and understanding with her, they talk to her and explain every part of the process. She now willingly goes and lets them do her cleaning without complaining or crying. She says Dr. Bala is her friend she loves it here. Thank you for caring for her for your kindness and patience.</review>

Always a great experience, even if we need to have an extra procedure done. My daughter is kinda big on sensory stuff and this place feels fun and safe for her. The staff are calm and gentle and the doctors are so communicative and understanding. I feel like my kid is safe here and everyone speaks to me like I’m a competent parent. Wish I had this place when I was a kid.<//review>

<review>The visit was great. Everyone is very friendly and helpful, and the dentists take the time to show and explain any work they identify as needing to get done. Good spot to take kids, especially those that are a little nervous about the whole dentist experience (like my 7-year-old son). Highly recommended.< /review>< time>

Dr Bhullar and her team is really amazing and professional. I’ve been going here for 3 + years and never have I ever felt being pushed for any treatment which is not needed for my kids. She saved my 2 yrs old decaying tooth so well that we never had to go the route of extractions. I would trust her advise anyday with my closed eyes. Awesome place.< /text>

<Review>The dentist and dental
Assistant we see here are wonderful - my son does so great and we have always been very happy here. On our recent visit they said we had to call from the parking lot and they would tell us when to come up (so there aren’t a bunch of people in the waiting room). They told us to come up and checked our temps. Then 3 more families came in - two not wearing masks at all, two in masks but only covering mouth not nose. We opted to wait in the hall instead and my son really got impatient waiting in a hallway with his mask on - I wish so much they didn’t let us up until it was time to go in, we would have been happier waiting in the car. Then once inside I was surprised they didn’t space the kids out on the patient stations (there were 4 and the two occupied were next to each other). Staff and parents had masks and staff had gloves but I still felt they could have done much better with covid protocols and enforcing masks in the waiting room.< /Review><Name>Jessica Oates< /Name><response>{'time': 1593706366481, 'text': 'Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

Honestly, I have yet to come across another children’s dentistry like Hercules Kids.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None</Response>< gmapID>

Update****
I wish I could Hercules Kids Dentistry 10 Stars.
My son and I are so grateful!! We were told to keep an eye on a particular tooth. Of course it came full circle when my son started complaining about the exact same tooth. The office staff squeezed my son into their packed schedule. Dr. Bala was right again!! The tooth was getting infected and he removed the tooth with right away. He was able to keep my son calm and things went very smoothly.  He’s back to bouncing around and playing.

My son and I love Hercules Kids Dentistry! The staff is always super sweet and professional. I really like both Dr. Bhullar & Dr. Bala. They are both really good with kids and understand how to encourage them. I’m very pleased and happy we found them so close to home. The entire team is very personable.

Thank You Hercules Kid Dentistry</Text>

I am so happy we found Hercules dentistry both Dr. Bhullar and Dr. Bala know how to take care of our little kiddos teeth. They are extremely patient and know how to work with little ones.

My 11 year old son got a baby tooth pulled, and a filling. Our experience was positive. We were in and out. No complications.  Very affordable. Friendly, helpful staff. I'd definitely recommend if your looking for quality work at affordable prices.<//text>

I have 3 children and all 3 have very different teeth. That being said we were helped by 3 assistants, 2/3 were very friendly.  The dentist was amazing with the kids! He was friendly, kind and eased my mom shaming I received from the unfriendly assistant. Overall I say it was a good experience and I would recommend them.<//text>

Dr. Bala and his sister (forgot her name) provide EXCELLENT pediatric dental care. We love the fact that they value continuity of care— which is not so common in today’s ubiquitous “factory” approach to dentistry. We’ve been with them for 10yrs and counting, and we really trust their opinion. They are very warm, calling the kids by nicknames, comforting them (and us parents when needed), and inquiring about their school endeavors and such. Their dental assistants are nice and gentle. Dr. Bala and his sister are a rare gem. I HIGHLY recommend them without reservation!!< /text>

The doctor explained everything (in a kid way) directly to my daughter which I thought was important. We left with the feeling that this place was “fun”. Lots of toys to choose from at the end and stickers for being a great kid. Definitely recommend Hercules Kids Dentistry!<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

<Review>I was never excited to go to the dentist as a kid, my daughter counts down the days when her appointment is nearing. She Loves her Dentist, they do an amazing job taking care of my little ones teeth. We moved almost an hour away but I’ll continue to drive down to Hercules just to bring my daughter to the best dentist around. They are so clean, so organized, and so many fun things for the kids to do while they wait, it’s all about the kids here.</Review>< pics>

Took my son to his dentist appointment yesterday. They happened to move to the 1st floor room 180. I believe it was to expand because it’s bigger and has more employees. However, still a nice setting with professional people. Even the new employees are very polite and professional. Five stars because of the care they give, professionalism and setting. I always recommend this place hands down.< /Text>

My Son (6) was seen here , he was very comfortable with the dentist as well as the Asst . He found them to be very welcoming and nice . My husband was so pleased his only issue was that the front desk people may have been a little rude but other then that they can’t wait to get my daughter there for a appointment next.</Text>

<text>Hands down best dentistry for kids !!!! As most Mother’s know our kids safety and health is very important. I Researched and visited many dentistries and as soon as I walked in to Hercules Kids Dentristy I knew I was in the right place.  The receptionist greeted us with a warm welcome, the dental assistant was so friendly and patient and made my 2yr old feel safe. She was so good at brushing his teeth I was even amazed at how well he allowed her to it. He did better with her than with me! Then the doctor comes in with a huge smile and such a vibrant smile and warm welcoming. The doctor was so gentle and playful my son too allowed him to do his checkup and the varnish. He explained in detail what he saw and what to expect in the coming months.</text><UserId.>116132367875336231885</UserId.><Gmap_id>0x808576cfcd2c85d1:0xf0b93bfa904b05c4</Gmap_id>< user_name>

First time taking my 2 year old and I love it. After weeks of looking for a good pediatric dentist that accepted medical. I was lucky to find this wonderful place. They had toys for kids to play with it. They took us in same day really quick barely waited any time in the waiting room. Took us in quickly doctor was very nice and gentle with her and gave her balloon and toys. Loved it. Really recommend.< /Text>

<Review>This place is amazing! The doctors and nurses are very professional as well as warm and engaging with my children. The office has all kinds of things for kids, including a large bucket of gender-mixed toys and a wall of iPads in the waiting room, and flat screen TVs at every station that plays a kids movie. My kids don't love "the dentist" but they never complain about going here.</Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Dr. Bala did an excellent job of preparing my two-year-old for his visit. The team at Hercules Kids Dentistry uses age-appropriate language and comfort positions (knee-to-knee) to help young patients understand and cope with their dental cleaning.<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Our kids really enjoy going here and the dentists and dental assistants are great working with children. They know how to make them feel comfortable and they are good with explaining things in detail to the parents.  I only gave 4 stars as I feel like all front office staff at the checkin desk should be more knowledgeable.  In the past they have been but on our last visit the young ladies did not know if we needed to pay a copay or not and she didn't know how to check. They seemed unfamiliar about different types of insurances and their requirements.  Hopefully with training they will improve.  Overall our children enjoy the fun toys and atmosphere.  As long as they are happy, mom and dad are happy.< /text>

<text>Great experience
Daughter was nervous at first, but Jessica and Dr Bala did a great job putting her at ease and the appointment was a breeze.
Nice touches: special prizes for completing her visit, cute certificate for “no cavities”, friendly staff, welcoming environment.
My daughter left the appointment happy and excited about her visit. Great job!

<text>First time coming here and it was great. Checked in and about 5 minutes later called back. Everyone was very sweet especially to my daughter. The dentist was very nice and answered any questions I had and explained everything before he did it. My daughter left with a smile on her face. I'm glad I decided to bring her here.< /text><Date>1531960764520</Date>< resp>

< Review>
They recently moved downstairs and the new space is very spacious! Very clean and bright. Today was my kid's second appointment with HKD and she didn't like the cleaning part so she wanted to stop in them middle. The technician was very patient and tried very hard to convince my kid to finish the cleaning. The dentist was very nice and encouraging. Would definitely recommend them to my mama friends.< /Review>

There virtually no wait, Dr, and hygienist are very thorough and great at keeping children calm. I highly recommend this practice to anyone looking for pediatric dentist in the area.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

My daughter has always had anxiety when going to the dentist. I was recommended here for service by another dental office so I made an appt and they have did an excellent job of always making my kids feel comfortable and friendly. As well as giving their best opinion and keeping you informed!!!! I recommend Kids Dentistry to any parent with kids from ages 1 yrs to 10yrs< /Review>

Dr. Bala and his staff are great! A great first impression all around - efficient, well kept office, welcoming, lively, and very good with the kids.

Dr. Bala is great with the kids. Keeps them entertained and distracted while having such a positive attitude. Would highly recommend this office for anyone looking for a new pediatric dentist in the area!!</Review>

Dr Bala and his staff are amazing! I have reserved and sensitive kids both of whom have never been anxious of visiting Dr Bala. They actually get excited for their visits. The office is super clean, the staff is friendly, warm and welcoming, and Dr Bala is gentle, kind, and very comfortable with kids. He provides ample information about your child’s dental care and needs, recommendations for products, and never rushes you. The cleanings and exams are quick yet thorough. Kids have the option of wearing sunglasses and watching a movie on a screen above the exam tables. There are also cheeky murals painted throughout the office, so their are a lot of distractions (wink). I truly can’t say enough about this office! Unparalleled pediatric dental care. We are grateful to this team!</text>

From the checkin, lobby area with an abundance of toys, books, and ipads, to the friendly nature of the dental hygienists and dentists themselves. My kid was having a great time, loved the TV as he got his teeth cleaned, and was sort of sad when the exam was done. These guys are professionals in working with kids, cannot recommend them more.</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

<text>Hercules Kids Dentistry is great. Their staff is very friendly and helpful. I've taken my daughter a couple times and she likes it and does great. I also appreciate that they remind me multiple times about the appointment which helps someone as forgetful as me.</text>< pictures>

I found this office when I use to live in the area, and after moving about twenty miles out I continued to keep this office as our Pediactic dental office. It’s worth the Bay Area traffic commute (learned to schedule appts in low traffic timeframes)
The doctors here are great and the majority of the dental assistants match the pleasant attitudes of the doctors. This is a great office that works for me and my kids. Definitely worth the commute!< /review>

Today was my girls and I first time at Hercules Kids Dentistry and my girls love it. The staff are super friendly and very professional. The office is super clean. Dr. Bala is super friendly and professional as well, he know what he is doing. The girls was getting their teeth done and watching a movie at the same time. I’ve never seen that before and it was an amazing experience. I will definitely recommend this place.</Text>

Take your little one here! Everyone was friendly and the decor was so cute. They made my daughter feel at ease by explaning what they where doing. They also had a tv directly above which helped to distract her.

She only received her 6 months check up and cleaning so I can’t speak for scarier procedures.<//text>

We have had countless bad/awful previous dental experiences, but HKD has proven that there is a local children's dentistry that caters to both the child and the parent. My son was treated with respect and kindness by EVERY member of their team. Dr. Bala has an amazing way of interacting with the child and including them with every process as it is happening.

Dr. Bala is absolutely amazing! My 3 year old had a rough first go at the dentist, our son was anxious and not cooperative. But Dr.Bala has made each time we come more comfortable and easy for our son. He doesn't get frustrated, and his staff and himself are great at making accommodations for strong willed children  He offers multiple options for treatment but makes sure you know the pros and cons. Children's dentistry is the most perfect career for a person with this much calmness and ability to be attentive to your child needs.<//Review>

The staff always makes my son comfortable and welcome. Dentist is great, very calm demeanor and made sure to explain step by step what he was going to do next.
Their waiting room is equipped with a t.v., tablets installed in the walls, and plenty of books and toys. Making the wait a breeze.</text>

<review>Two of my kids were seen here shortly after office opened, and were able to see both of the office providers. It was offered to me to be in the room during my kids appointments, but I declined, as my kids have always seen the dentist while I waited in the lobby.
Both dentists were very patient with the kids, explained everything in full detail to me, made sure I understood everything, as well as inquired if I had any questions for them.
One of my kids had to come back the next day to get his first cavity filled. He was able to watch a movie while Dr. Bala took care of his tooth! Once his treatment was complete, he wanted to stay longer to watch the movie.
Once their appointments were finished, the kids were able to create their own goody bags.
Kids are already asking when they get to come back!
I would, and have already, recommended this office to others.<//review><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

Dr. Bala is very thorough and patient (lol) with children. It's a fun office for kids; every appointment we've attended there's a movie on to keep the kiddos entertained, and he even has screens on the ceiling in the exam room which keeps kids calm and focused on something else. Keep up the great work!!<//text>

This was my sons first visit to the dentist. I am definitely what some would call a ‘helicopter mom’ and I was very nervous about how this visit would go. This whole experience was great, from the front receptionist helping me make the appointment to the actual dental cleaning with the dentist. We saw Dr. Bhullar and she made me feel so comfortable from the moment she walked out to greet us! She took the time to patiently explain everything to me, from what we would be doing during the visit through aftercare. My son can be a bit stubborn and quite loud but Dr. Bhullar got his cleaning done quite quickly without nearly as much fuss as I expected! We will be back to see her for my sons next visit in 6 months!< /Text>

My daughter had her first dentist appointment (ever) today with Dr. Bala and I'm glad to see she is not scared to go again! I was nervous that she would be afraid and that getting her teeth checked would be uncomfortable (or even painful) for her - but I'm relieved after meeting Dr. Bala and his friendly team. They are the perfect team to aid little patients and provide a safe and happy experience to their patients.

I'll definitely be keeping them as my daughter's dental office!

Dr Bala and his staff make the kids feel very comfortable and relaxed. Dr Bala has a unique way of letting the kids know that they are in safe hands and no procedure is scary. I am so glad, I found out about them.</Review>

I am so lucky that I found this Doctor - Amrit Bala for my boys. He is by far the best doctor and has the best team working for him. There is zero wait time and everyone is on top of their game! Dr. Bala makes my boys so comfortable that they leave the clinic with a smile on their face!! One of his staff members- Pooja is the best!! Recommend this place to everyone!!< /Review>

<review>This review is long over due. We’ve been coming to HKD since my son was 2yrs old. I’m so grateful to have found this place! Dr. Bala, Dr. Bhullar, and their staff are extremely professional and friendly. They are so patient and kind and really know how to make coming to the dentist a fun and enjoyable experience.  My son looks forward to his visits with Dr. Bala and doesn’t want to leave when it’s time to go. Lol!! That says a lot!! If you’ve been looking for a pediatric dentist, look no more!!! They are the best!!!!< /review>< Pics>

I’ve been going to Hercules Kids Dentistry for about a year now. My sons love his dr and he had a special case of tooth decay which dr Bhullar handled really really well. I always felt informed and safe for my kids with all the treatment choices. Will always recommend.</Text>

They told me my kid couldn't come for his teeth to be looked at because he missed three appointments and so they wouldn't see him anymore which is ridiculous to me he's a child it's not his fault. That is the stupidest policy I have ever heard of for a child's  dentists office.<//text>

Friendliest Kids Dental Office I have visited. The office is inviting, there are toys for boys and girls, trucks, iPads, Tv's, table toys, gadgets, etc to keep the little ones minds going. I also love the kid friendly wall arts. The staff have been amazing. My daughter usually see's the same assistant and Dr. A Bala. He is a super personable and friendly doctor, he keeps us imformed about whats going on, whats best for us, what to do, and answers every question that I always have. I am glad we chose Hercules Kids Dentistry, and I definitely recommend Dr. A Bala and his office anytime and everytime.<//review>

Updated Visit:
Today we realized that we’ve been coming to HKD for almost four years! We still love it! The staff continues to remain friendly and Dr. Bala or his amazing sister are amazing! It’s like family when we visit. My kids don’t fuss over their appointment. It’s a great team they have put together. We’ll see you next year. Unless you have Halloween treats. 😉 Cheers!

Previous Message:

(Translated by Google) My experience with this team of dental professionals is incredible, the staff is friendly and helpful all the time, they help me with my Spanish language. You register, you wait for a moment, approximately 3 minutes, they call the children and immediately X-rays dental cleaning dental check-up with the dentist, he explains and gives recommendations, this day my daughter had dental sealants, her gift for each child and of course her toothbrush, for last schedules the next appointment.
Amazing. Happy children and mom Felis.
