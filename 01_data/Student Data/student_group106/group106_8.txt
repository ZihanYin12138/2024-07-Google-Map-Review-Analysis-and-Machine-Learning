Peter worked with me and helped me out a ton. The first approval wasn't the best and he insisted on not accepting that offer and he worked on getting a better deal for me.(which is very honest and made me feel like he really wanted the best deal for me) Sure enough he got me the best deal and saved me over 8% on interest. He offered a warranty and advised me on contacting him if i had any issues. The whole process was very easy, he made it very clear and understandable of what i was getting myself into. My new SUV was fully detailed and they even filled up the gas tank for me. Thanks again peter and the whole crew at 2win, you guys got me and my family helped out and exactly what we needed.</review>

Nice cars but won’t budge on prices at all.
Very upsetting
You’d think with cash and hand they would have some wiggle room.
Oh well<//text>

My mom had been looking for an SUV and after going to multiple places and failing to find something that she liked/was in our price range, I asked around and 2win Auto Sales was recommended by a good friend so we decided to give it a try. I was helped by Peter and he was very knowledgeable and honest about the cars...we looked at a few cars on the lot and then he took us to their other lot down the street where they had even more cars to choose from...she ended up going with a 2015 Ford Escape and she loves it...from the time we got there to the time we were driving the car home, the whole process took no longer than an hour..my only regret is not knowing about this place a lot sooner, it woulda saved me so much time and stress..Thank you to Peter for being so helpful and patient...would definitely recommend and will be coming back in the future< /review>

i’m not one to ever leave a review anywhere but i was so impressed at how helpful, patient and friendly they were here. they definitely do not pressure you into purchasing a car like every other dealer. they went above and beyond their ways to make sure we left satisfied and we sure did especially for traveling 2 hours out! super nice, well taken care of cars at great prices! HIGHLY RECOMMEND.< /Text>

Great deal and amazing showmanship.  We let them know we would be out to look at a van in 90 minutes and it was ready to be viewed.  The gentlemen are professional, can keep conversations going, and know what they are doing.  Great job.< /Text>

This place is a rip off. Do not buy nothing from this dealership, his cars are nice looking on the outside, but take one and have it inspected, bought a car from him for 13k have had it a year, airbag light keeps coming on, so after trying to trade it in for a newer car they discovered that it had no airbags in it, they have been removed when they putt it back together. Yea! It has ben wrecked and the car fax the dealer provided says it had never been in an accident, yet it has had the frame cut and replaced on the front end, the hood has been changed the back bumper and both front fenders, so watever you do, buy somewhere else< /review>

<Text>I was unpleased about the experience I revived at this dealership. The guys were pressuring me on buying a car that I personally didn’t like. If I could put zero stars i would.

We purchased a 2009 Chevy Express Van from 2 WIN last year.  I was a little apprehensive as this was my first car I purchased sight unseen over the internet.  The salesman (Peter?) was awesome to work with and they even brought the car to a local shop (Oakdale Garage) for an inspection that I paid for.  Once I flew into Stockton Peter was waiting with the van. I left a satisfied customer a few hours later.  Awesome experience, made it so easy to purchase from another state.  When I got home I noticed it was missing a cup holder so I sent a text to Peter.  Within a few weeks a brand new cup holder was delivered to our home!<//text>

I go here for their burritos. I get the super carne asada burrito which comes with rice, beans, cheese, meat, sour cream, guacamole, and salsa. These burritos are just about $10 and are huge!< /Review>

I have been coming here for 10 years and have always had a good experience. I ordered burritos yesterday and the pico de gallo tasted like fish. I bought Al Pastor meat to cook today and the meat was sour and spoiled. I am not sure what happened but, this is unfortunate. I hope this does not happen to anyone else.< /review>

<Review>Been coming here for years. The food is great, but seems like every 6 months there prices go up by .25 cents.

So, now I just go every so often. I used to go about 3 to 4 times a week. But, like I said the prices started going up around 2010.

Otherwise, great food!</Review><name>Eduardo M Miles< /name><GmapID>0x808f8f9cc710b6e5:0x3d2618a760c0ef71</GmapID>< Response>

Great local market to run to to grab few things.  Guys behind meat/ seafood counter are always so helpful and greet you with a smile.  Prices on produce much cheaper than big-name chains.  Restaurant side is decent if you crave a burrito while you're there.  Salsa isn't my favorite,  but ok.<//text>

< review>
Came here with my grandparents for lunch, they had Birria de Chivo. Been waiting a long time to try it again because all people have been serving me everywhere was Birria de Res. Anyways I took a first bite and the flavors we're different than before. It's relaxing, it's calming, it's flavorful. But mostly it's so good and juicy you wanna consume most of it. I would totally come back and I definitely recommend it.</review>

Little pricey than other Latin stores. But has allot of Latin American items, drinks, beer, produce I'm not to happy about they could do way better. Customer service is awesome. Store is clean, handicap parking and accessible. No public restrooms.</Text>

I ponder the visit. Staff assumes others can't comprehend what they are speaking when insults are spoken. Further, felt unwelcomed because my Hispanic roots don't stand out as much as my Italian, Native American and African roots do.</Text>

Good store to stop by and get that last minute item you forgot. Clean and lines are never long. The only down side, they stop selling alcohol early.</Text>

<review>This is a review for the taqueria. There are TWO locations of Los Pericos Taqueria on 14th, and I've been to both, only because I was meeting a friend at the one, but he wasn't there but said he was, so I had to go to the other less than 2 blocks away. I like the bigger location with sunny windows, colorful green birds painted on the walls, and the big salsa bar. Both are good. I always get the ceviche tostada, because yum and less than $5. Their guacamole is great here too and a good value.< /review>< Rating>

(Translated by Google) I like to buy there, what is bad for me is the service of the cashiers, they are not friendly at all, it seems that they do not give them training on how to treat the customer, they do not say hello, they do not smile or thank them and that is very important for a business I have already heard other comments about that

(Original)
Me gusta comprar ahí lo k se me hace mal es el servicio de las cajeras,no son nada amables parece que no les dan entrenamiento de como tratar al cliente,no saludan,no sonríen ni las gracias dan y eso es muy importante para un negocio yo ya he escuchado otros comentarios acerca de eso< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The food at the taqueria is very good, it hurts that the girl who served us was not friendly at all.

The meat and cheeses in the market are the best!

<Review>I was only in and out super quickly, but I was there turning in a year of the dog scratcher that my dude purchased there ( I didn't even know this at the time) but the cashier lady said that that was the most she'd ever seen or exchanged since she'd been working there. I thought that was pretty cool.
I am not from Oroville but my overall experience visiting our shopping at as far as a liquor store goes was good. Cashier was nice, personable and friendly. The attendant was also very helpful. I would definitely make this this liquor store my "home liquor store"</Review><user>112052729943705404252<//user><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Clean, well stocked, prices typical for a convenience store. A glass of ice is a little steep. But when it Is hot outside,  I guess it is worth it.< /Review>

I've been going to that little store for 63years. I remember my brother and I would walk there with 25 cents, buy a pepsi and a bag of bar b que chips. Sit outside and enjoy the soda and chips, return the bottle and get a candy bar.</Text>

Relationships between barbers are close and it reflects on their work. Everyone is always ready to schedule and assist walk-ins even though the clientele is strong.
Strongly recommend booking with Jack's Barbershop.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<text>I’ve been getting my hair cut at Jacks Barbershop for over 3 years now and I always leave completely satisfied. My barber Jesse pays close attention to detail and I always get compliments on my haircuts. The shop is newly renovated and has a lot of great barbers which make the wait time very short. Appointments are always professional and on time! I’ve never had anyone cancel or mix up my appointments which shows that they are always on top of everything! I highly recommend this barbershop if you are looking for a good haircut and good vibes!!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x809107e96ac9b31d:0x32ff15979be8822b< /GmapID></record>

I seldom write reviews but this is an exception as the professionalism, customer service and overall experience at Jack's Barber Shop is second to none. I relocated from LA a few years ago and needed a good barber. After trying several places and not being 100% satisfied, I found Jack's. From the point you walk in, Jesse and his team make you feel welcomed. He treats his clients with respect and as the owner, he takes pride in the shop and it shows!! The shop is immaculate with a relaxed and upbeat atmosphere. They are experienced barbers who know how to cut and they make you want to come back again and again! If you are looking for a local barber shop in the Turlock area, Jack's is the best in town!!!< /text>

I’ve been coming to this barbershop weekly for 5 years now consistently getting cut by Jesse (the owner). Not only is he the best he is extremely flexible with my busy schedule and very personable every time. He has made getting a haircut something to look forward to every week. Overall all the barbers here are very experienced and personable. Highly recommended!<//Text>

So I wanna shout this place out I always get the freshest cleanest cuts no complaints would definitely choose this place over Caddy’s. This place is straightforward if you set an appointment with anybody you will be seen at that time any Barber will take care of you and you leave home happy. You won’t be rolling the dice or a gamble everybody cuts clean check them out. Also want to shout on my boy Jesse always taking care of me always making me feel like a different Person every time I leave go looking out brother!!!!!!!!! Much Love I Respect your Hustle 🙏💯💪👌🏻🔥⛽️< /Text>

<review>I've been coming here for almost 3 years now, always getting a cut with Jesse. The first time I went in I didn't have an appointment but I was still able to get a cut. It's the only barber shop I've been to since I moved to Turlock. Jesse is really detail oriented and always flexible with scheduling. The same can be said about the other barbers there too. Overall, I've always had a good experience coming here and I would highly recommend it to everyone.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><Gmap_id>0x809107e96ac9b31d:0x32ff15979be8822b<//Gmap_id><response>None< /response><date>1594086599298</date>< Name>

<text>Have been going there for about 2 years and all of their barbers are always great. They have a really relaxed environment there and everyone is incredibly friendly.

Jessie is great excellent customer service! The Barbershop really makes an effort to appease all their clients, get to know each clients needs, taking the time to make each trim and style perfect, making sure the clients are satisfied and desires to come return for future visits. Highly recommend! 10/10</Text>

A relaxing place to get your haircut. Best quality in Turlock and I’ve been living in Turlock my whole life. The owner Jesse is a humble hard worker and his work speaks for itself. Highly recommend.</Text>

The first time I went to the shop Barber Jesse just had a cancellation & was able to take me right away. The rest is history. I’ve been going for a haircut here now for almost three years. I’ve only had to be assisted by another barber twice in almost three years, I mention that because I was still able to get the same quality cut. I believe because Jesse just don’t let anyone cut in his shop. He is very professional as is everyone else that works there. The atmosphere is very comfortable especially with the remodel! I live in Merced & will continue to drive to Turlock to get my “du-did” 😎 I would strongly recommend checking this place out, they have a vision for where Jacks Barbershop 💈 is going & im just glad to be a part of it! Keep up the great work JESSE&Crew !!!!</Text>

I was in Turlock for work and desperately needed a cut.

Found Caddy's literally around the corner from my hotel.

Great place, nice vibe, friendly and not rushed in anyway.

I was a walk-in, but was able to get in right away with Melanie.

Wonderful barber, detail oriented and she communicated with me on how I wanted my haircut and she took the time to cut a little and ask me if that was what I had in mind. Perfect. My hair is absolutely straight and is a real problem to cut correctly - no problem for Melanie and I'm pleased with the results!

Definitely recommend the shop and Melanie in particular for the great cut and pleasant conversation.<//Text>

Was visiting from out of town and found this place. It was a busy shop with a lot of barbers working. My barber was quite young, but very meticulous. I got a great fade, line up, and for only $5 extra he tackled my unkept 3 month beard ($20 for just a cut). I would recommend this place to anybody.< /Review>

<Review>I moved to Turlock about a year ago and l've had problems trying to get decent fades. That was until today when I walked into Caddy's. As soon as I walked in I was greeted and seated without an appointment. Marvin took good care of me. I showed him a picture of what I was looking for and he hooked me up. No question without a doubt I'll be back.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Very clean landscape. Very nice ocean breeze.  Great for group meetings or celebrations. Covered areas for food and plenty of parking.< /Text>

<Review>Clean, lawns immaculant, paved walking  path for walking, skating, bikes, etc. Very safe environment. Many dog owners walking doggies and having a pleasant time, meeting the same, and dogs usually get along. A jungle gym sanded area for children, basketball court. No restrooms, so keep in mind when planning a visit. The park is very clean, everyone that visits seems to do their part. I have never seen trash outside the bin. Those that visit seem to return.</Review>< response>

The park is always quiet and peaceful even though there are always plenty of people around. Great for walking dogs, talking an evening walk or with the kids playing of the equipment. Everyone always says hello and this makes it a nice experience.</Text>

It's a great park but those who let their dogs go off leash should watch them--that is, little dogs rushing up to big dogs and barking in their face. If they do that to the wrong dog, there could be an accident. If a person let's them off leash, they could put them on leash when someone else with a dog approaches them.</Text>

<Text>Lagenbeck Park is probably my favorite place just to lay down in the grass and stare at the sky. It's close enough for me to just open my back gate and step out side and feel the fresh air. There's a base ball pit and people play soccer. Over all a calming place most of the time. Somethimes its loud due to birthday parties but over all I love it.
Though a bit of a warning scince I know a lot of people are scared of dogs. Usually there at least 5 dogs any where in the park and around 20% of the time they are off leashes. I myself am terrified of dogs but I still think they are adorable. Decreases the liking of the park as a whole due to so many dog walkers but over all gret place more like 4.3 star for me.</Text><name>lizard-ate-my-homerwork 898<//name><Rating>4< /Rating>< resp>

When I went to pay for it they referred me to some ATS automotive. This is a test only location, so they are not allowed to make referrals as it can be a conflict of interest. I didn't go to the place they referred me too, and instead I went to Auto Express, a much better and much more honest mechanic that also does smog. I had him check out my car and he found nothing wrong with it. He ran emissions tests on it twice and told me that there should be no problem passing it. So I brought it back to AD smog because they had offered me $10 off a retest (even though the sign on the wall inside says the first retest is free) and it failed again. So I immediately brought it over to Auto Express and he had him smog it. It passed with flying colors. When I inquired what was going on, he told me that AD smog must be measuring emissions while the vehicle is cold, a practice that is not supposed to happen and often results in an unwarranted failed test. AD smog was able to get $110 out of me for smog tests and made an illegal referral to another business that I assume they are hoping will also benefit from this arrangement they have. Total scam here, don't bring your vehicle to dishonest people. I should not fail a test at one location, drive 3 blocks and then pass the test at another location. That tells me that there is something wrong with AD Smog. I passed 3 separate emissions tests with Auto Express, yet I failed both at AD Smog. Don't waste your money here or at their affiliate location ATS automotive! Deceptive and illegal practices!!!!</Text><Pics>None</Pics><userid>106171149325062018875<//userid><rating>1<//rating>< date>

This is the best little smog station in town. They are honest and kind. The prices are great. The service is top-notch. I recommend driving an extra distance to come to this place.<//text>

They're really nice and efficient. If your first smog check doesn't pass. Your second one is free; you just pay the DMV reporting fee.</Text>

I came from out of town to sell a car and needed it smogged (a requirement for selling in CA). Unfortunately, the FedEx nearby wouldn't print the sale documents I needed. The receptionist here printed it for me and made sure I knew all the rules for selling a car. Absolute sweetheart!<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I’ve been going to this place for the last 8 years. Not anymore.

This place was great for a long time until recently the owner started to yell at customers and his employee.  The owner has a very bad temper and have NO customer service skills.

When I was there last time the owner was training a new employee. I feel so bad for the new employee. The owner almost made the new employee cry. Thats not the right way to treat people.

Also be careful with the pricing when they quoted you. It can changed daily. Dishonest dishonest dishonest.

I will NOT recommend this place.< /text>

This wasn't my usual place, but it is now.

I was helping a friend on this side of town and called around local smog stations. The price quoted here was significantly lower than others, which drew me in but also made me nervous. Usually you get what you pay for, but I left feeling the service was as least equal to the other guys, despite paying about half as much. I did wait about 10 or so minutes longer than I'm used to, but I also heard someone comment about how busy it was, so I'd probably chalk it up to that. Very satisfied overall and will definitely be recommending and returning.< /review>

My go-to smog shop. I have taken multiple vehicles here and never have to wait long even if there are other people ahead of me. Very reasonable prices and if you have an issue passing smog they help you find the problem, how to fix it, and will run the test for you again. Highly recommended!<//Text>

<Text>I love this place!!!
Ignore the one negative reviewer. I have been coming here for years now. They are fast, polite, and efficient. My smog tests have always passed without any problems. The prices are reasonable as well.
They also have a nice waiting room to unwind in loaded with qualitity magazines, plenty of chairs and tables, a ceiling fan creating a cool breeze, and a water fountain to complete the relaxing atmosphere.
I always call ahead of time to see how busy they are to find the best time to go. I was just there, and I was in and out in less than 20 minutes. This is my go-to spot... without question, I will definitely be back!<//Text><Gmap_id>0x809ad0e0131eb91d:0xe65e5eeebe8d8bff< /Gmap_id><Time>1471563979143<//Time><UserId.>118300789041452962913<//UserId.>< rating>

Avoid Ad Smog At All Costs! They Are Incompetent & Don't Know Emission Standards Or Laws! They Failed My Classic Chevy Truck On The Visual Test Because They Couldn't Find An EO Number On My Headers. I Told Them I Don't Need To Have An EO Number Because My Truck Doesn't Have A Catalytic Convertor & All The Smog Stuff Is Still Connected. They Rudely Said "They Never Heard Of That & We Are A Business & Don't Have Time To Look Up That Information!" I Had To Go To Another Smog Shop Which Said "Ad Smog Shouldn't Be In Business If They Didn't Know That Information!" I Wonder How Many Other Vehicles Ad Smog Failed That Should've Passed!<//Review>

When my van failed smog, he explained what the problem was in great detail.  When I "fixed" the issues as he described it I realized that the part that was given to me by the people at the O'Reilly store on Florin gave me the WRONG part.  When I went back to get it re-smogged, Pete stopped me and told me that the van would not pass smog if I tried it again with the part I replaced.  I the went to Napa auto and they gave me the right part.  Pete saved me $40.  Thank you Pete :)</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

I came in at 9:30 am and he told me the estimated wait time is 45 minutes. After 45 minutes, he told me there is another 1 hr 30 minutes of wait time. After that, it is still not my turn. When I am done, it is already 1:15 pm. This is wasting people's time. Another thing that was really annoying is that the manager kept advertising his newly-opened Chinese restaurant to every customers who came to do SMOG. This is very un-professional.< /review>< name>

< Review>
We had been looking for a chest and a night stand for long time and finally found the one in Muuduu website with decent look and price. Besides, they are offering free delivery within Los Angeles area. I called and placed an order. The delivery was really fast and the product is very good looking with unbeatable price. Thanks<//Review>

Recently purchase a New home and I need a lot of furniture to fill up my new house, been searching and comparing prices online for weeks… I decided to go with Muuduu basic on the location (they are really close to where I live) and the price (the lowest price you can find online).
Dan is a very hardworking and responsive person, he got my furniture delivered on time and took care of any imperfections on items.
I only have 1 suggestion—Muuduu could hire more “customer care reps” to take care of daily orders and phone calls, although they always return phone calls, they just don’t have enough people to handle such a busy place.
Overall, I was really pleased with the services and the quality of furniture that Muuduu has to offer and that's the reason for keep me coming back for more furniture :)< /Review>

<date>1526621148797< /date><review>I bought sofa online on website of Muuduu. I was worried as I always like to see things with my own eyes in a shop.. but the price was great. I risked it and it paid off as my table and chairs look better in real life than on the screen. Quick delivery and delivery guy was nice. Easy to build up and really sturdy table! I love it... one very pleased customer. Would definitely recommend! Thanks!< /review><username>trang tran</username><pics>None</pics><GmapID>0x80c2d592cc690a03:0x991f00443c4f78a6<//GmapID>< resp>

<review>I have purchased several items from here.  All have exceeded my expectations for quality and come at a great price.  Bought a midcentury modern dining set.  Saw the same one for double the price at one of the big furniture chains.  Will buy here again. After ordering online, it works best to call them directly to get precise delivery date.</review>< pics>

Delighted with our purchase from Muuduu Furniture. We ordered a daybed by phone and had all our questions answered by a very gracious representative. The shipping department kept in touch to let us know when to expect delivery. Then the truck driver followed up with a specific estimated time of arrival. The delivery people carried the bed we purchased directly to the room where it will be kept. They arranged the boxes for easy handling. I would not hesitate to buy from Muuduu again.<//review>

I purchased a beautiful, solid, dinning table, and I'm very happy with the quality and the design of it. The instructions and the way how the table and chairs were packed made very easy the assembly.
Customer Service was great, I had to make a change on the order three days after the purchase; and even though it is a high season  I got my table after a week and a half of purchase, which is the time frame they give you. Delivery service was great, Eddy contacted me  more than two hours before arrival which gave me plenty of time to make arrangements at work to be able to be home on time. The Estimated time of Arrival was very accurate, and the service was great and very careful!
Thanks to the help of all of you I was able to receive my parents visit  with a table to share great time and meals!<//Text>

I had a great experience ordering my daughters loft bed through Muuduu! The online process was easy. The bed was delivered in the time frame quoted. When I reached out to them inquiring the actual eta of the delivery they responded promptly with all the information I needed. They were absolutely great communicating with us the day of and day before delivery so we had a heads up when they would arrive which made it easy for us to go about our day and not have to sit around and wait! I will definitely order through them in the future!<//Review>

<Text>Amazing service. They usually are by appointment only, but they gladly squeezed me in because I had already scouted my couch out online. With that said, I was looking for location convenience and lowest price. I GOT BOTH HERE! Very beautiful pieces throughout the showroom. Would recommend to anyone looking for great looking furniture at super affordable prices.</Text></record>

We highly recommend Muuduu Furniture because of their great customer service along with a wide selection of items of style quality! The ordering and delivery process is user friendly and the phone reps are top notch pros! We are very happy customers and we will order from them again when we need items for our home.  It is rare to find such excellent personal service from order to delivery and set up and placement into the room desired! Our phone rep Jon was very helpful with all the details. Thanks to the entire Muuduu staff! Best regards, The Ladd family.<//review>

We were so glad to tumble across Muuduu furniture. We were able to pickup all of our furniture needs on the same day as a breeze. They had a whole bunch of display stuff for half off the original prices which made us saved even more. We are so in love with Muuduu. So many selections and styles for so cheap. Thank you for the great customer service.</Review>

<review>What an amazing company. I made an appointment and visited the  warehouse today, and I am excited  about  my purchase.  The customer service I received from John was TOP-NOTCH!!!  They have a vast selection of impressive products at an amazing price point.  I purchased my first two products today and,  I changed my mind on one item, so I requested  a change order a few hours later, after hours. They were so responsive that they already made the change I requested (seamlessly)and have kept my order on track!  I suspect/hope  this is the begining of of a very long and loyal  customer relationship.  The delivery was fast and perfect. The couch is smart looking!  The bookshelves are also attractive   and weren't too difficult to assemble. Thank you  Muuduu!!!</review><Date>1495907037442< /Date>< rate>

I was looking for a reasonably priced triple bunk bed, I found Muuduu had the best price by far with very reasonable shipping. Other stores were charging 100-200 just to ship. The bed arrived early. Driver called ahead to let me know he was about two hours out. The product was even better than I expected, quality was excellent, very sturdy, beautiful finish. They even followed up with me after to make sure I was happy with it. I would definitely recommend Muuduu and would order from them again.</Text>

Ordered a sofa and lounge chair.
They emailed me and agreed to deliver it two weeks ago so I waited at home on the delivery weekend date. I waited all day and they said that someone would call me before the delivery. No phone call, no delivery. I raised my frustration from canceling my plans to wait for them that weekend and
They agreed to deliver it to me a week after and stated the same thing as last time. Over the weekend I waited and still no phone call and no delivery. Their listed phone number goes into an infinite recorded answer machine loop and they have become unresponsive to my emails. They run their business like a scam. First theh collect your money, then they issue you false assurances and promises, then they become unresponsive when you inquire as to what is happening. I have emails proving all this. They hate their customers. Apparently this is common practice for them. I am pretty sure civil charges can be brought against them if not criminal charges.< /Text>

<text>My ordering/delivery experience with Muuduu was amazing. I ordered my dining room table and less than a week later received a call letting me know what day/time window it would be delivered. I received a call from the driver stating he would be there within 30 minutes of the time window starting. Just like clockwork he was there within 30 minutes. Once arrived both delivery associates kindly brought my table upstairs. They were very nice and friendly as well. The day after delivery I received a follow up call to make sure everything was perfect. Customer service was 110%!!!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><Response>{'time': 1490908840682, 'text': "I'm delighted that the whole process was simple and easy for you, Ebony!

Amazing place.  Incredibly knowledgeable staff, great selection, more than reasonable prices.  Everything in my house comes from this store.  It is definitely the best furniture store I've ever visited. Super fast delivery for free of charge. I will refer to all my family member and friends that I know.</review>

We have ordered a beautiful table for our kitchen and a Bedroom set for a guest room. I get numerous compliments on each time after time. I have recommended Muuduu to several friends and family.
If you compare the prices at Muuduu you will quickly order from them, for the value, quality, and price.<//Review>

<review>My boy Friend and I came here for my new house's furniture. They have all kinds of furniture that you can name out there. We scheduled an appointment to come by. Marilyn was very helpful and patient to pick out all the furniture we need from the guest room to the living room. It was kinda hard to order some items that we don't actually see. However they do go over the material, color and fabric to make sure it is what we wanted. Everything just came today and my house looks great. Especially for the price that we paid, I cannot ask for anything better. Thank you Muuduu for your service. Definitely will bring more business to you.</review>< pics>

<Time>1464056030562<//Time><rate>1< /rate><Review>OVER A MONTH TO RECEIVE A SHIPMENT?  I ordered a bed and patio furniture set over a month ago and still have not received ANYTHING!
My credit card was charged (of course)...  No answer for follow through with anything that they promise every time I talk to them!!!

My process started out online when I tired ordering over 11 different item which were apparently ALL SOLD OUT... I then called in to see what products do they actually have in stock, the lady convinced me to order a different patio set that they actually had in stock so I could receive it with in a week, (we had family coming to visit so I went with it).  About 2 weeks later after calling to find out what the hold up was I was informed they actually didn't have it "in stock" and couldn't get the set we had chosen (no idea when the next shipments would come).... but good news they have the bed and that could be shipped out to us.  Great, I said- please send the bed while I decided what my 13th option for patio furniture would be... I finally said i would wait for the original one I ordered while they see how much longer it would take (cant beat the prices -right!) - Well..... now over 4 weeks after ordering i have not received the bed they keep promising is going to be delivered on Tuesday... Every Tuesday comes and goes and still we have NO BED & NO Patio furniture and now cant reach any one to get a refund!!!

I guess you get what you pay for... don't buy into their Lies and false promises .... go spend your money else where!!!</Review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None< /Response>< gmap_id>

Muuduu is an awesome company to work with. I have been buying their furniture for my stagging business for years now, and they always surprise me with their excellent customer service every time. What I really like about them is they always check in with me after they deliver the furniture to make sure everything is just right. Ask for Dan or John when you call in to receive mind blowing customer service.<//Text>

I am leaving a review because I, like some people, was unsure about Muuduu. However, after receiving my order, Ia Really glad I bought with them.

I ordered bunk beds, and was astounded by how solid and nice they are for the price. Though I was skeptical at first, I spoke to customer service who was incredibly friendly and helped me with everything I needed. J

If you are considering buying form this place, give them a chance. It’s a small company, so they may not get back to you for a bit, but once they do they are so nice and they really do have great stuff that’s super cheap.<//Review>

This company is awesome! I don't know why their reviews are so low, but you cant satisfy everyone! I had placed items in my cart and printed the list out to check off everything I order because I had a big list of item due to redecorating. So i went in a few days later to order and the price jumped significantly. So at first i was super bummed and started looking for a couch else where. Them something told me to call them. I told them what the price was and they could find that price in the price history. So I emailed them my print out of my cart and they honored the price that was in my cart! Great customer service!< /Review>

After shopping around for over a month, we stumbled across Muuduu's website. Their prices are unbeatable! Some of their items are 1/3 the prices comparing to Overstock. I was a little skeptical buying from here at first so we booked an appointment with Jennifer. Upon arrival at their showroom, Jennifer patiently helped us picked out our bedroom sets, a dining set, and an outdoor sectional. However, we only bought a dining set the first visit because we weren't able to see the set in person but only samples. We just finally found the time to assemble it, and we love it. Thank u Jennifer for your advice and expertise. We will see u soon. samples. We just finally found the time to assemble it, and we love it. Thank u Jennifer for your advices and expertise.

<text>I choose using muumuu furniture mainly because their comparatively low price than others. The sofa I ordered just now has 200 bucks,  that's crazy. Another thing I wanna express my gratitude is that the representative called John do me a big favor that ship my sofa in a rush deliver because I and my girlfriend plan to go travel on the following week so receiving the sofa would be a problem for us. Most of all, the sofa I choose is my favorite one and match the color of the carpet.

Muuduu office called asking how to handle the return and I asked for replacement.  Basically that is the end of it, they would return emails with " we will look into this and respond".

<Text>After multiple attempts to get a status update on my order through their online system I still have not received any personal reply. In mid June when I placed the order over the phone with a representative,the item was supposed to be in stock.A few days later I received a generic email that they are moving to a new storage space.Why the salesman did not inform me when I was placing the order?Now,it is near the end of July and I have no idea if and when I'll get my order delivered.That's not the way to do bussiness.Order #292288<//Text>< Pictures>

<Review>Muuduu gets four stars from me because it is very difficult to reach a sales rep. However, when you do get one on the phone, they seem very polite and knowledgeable. My furniture got my delivery two days after placing an order over the phone because I was local. Everything came as it shown on the website, and I am very pleased with this experience expect I had to call multiple times to get a hold of them.</Review>< Pics>

I called Daniel and he claimed that the last piece is shipping from Texas, and it will take another 2 months. We need to wait TWO months for the last couch piece to arrive. I'm disappointed.

Old review: This is my go-to place for furniture. Prices and customer service is great. I called but they didn't answer, and Daniel called a few minutes later to turn the phone call. I already knew what I wanted because my brother-in-law has the same sectional, and it is SO comfortable and big! I'll have to wait until December for them to have the couch in stock, but I don't mind waiting especially for the great price they offered me. Thanks, Daniel!!<//review><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

<Text>If you don't want to get ripped off don't buy from Muuduu they fail to delivered original furniture and when I got it it was broken dirty and the cheapest quality nothing close to the real furniture a cheap copy and when you ask for refund forget it is been 8 months and no respond at all. Don't be fool with the prices worse costumer service. Better business bureau, consumers affairs and consumers trade commission are after Muuddu that's why they don't have life personal to talk or help you.</Text>< name>

I had been searching for a sofa at well known furniture stores for quite a while but did not find what I was looking for. I decided to search the internet and came across Muuduu Furniture. They had many styles that I was interested in. I made an appointment to visit their warehouse & Daniel was happy to explain details of each sofa and show me fabric samples. I ended up ordering a sofa and it was delivered to me within a week. I love my new sofa & I am planning to buy more furniture through Muuduu.< /Text>

I'm not happy with this service and I haven't received my furniture. I really thought reading on these good reviews, I would have had a better experience. I was informed my furniture would be delivered today a week ago, and that someone would call me back with the time estimate. I have literally wasted my entire Saturday waiting and trying to contact someone to find out what is going on. Someone finally called me back, but did not have answers for me. She said she was going to call me right back and never did! You are now closed and I will probably have to wait until Monday to find out what is going on, but at this point, I do not even want to do business with a place like this! Thanks for nothing! If I can give you, less than one star I would.<//text>

I have just moved to Southern California from Virginia. My girlfriend and I have been shopping for almost a month to furnish our new home in Chino. We went to Ashley, Living Spaces and all other furniture places that you can name in Southern California. Finally Muuduu website popped out after we did some research on a bedroom set my girl really wanted with the cheapest price. We called in to book an appointment and visited them the next day. I am so glad we found Muuduu. They saved us about 10k comparing to what we might have pay Ashley for the same products. Even though we had to wait for couple days to have everything set up due to the booked up schedule they had, everything turned out great. Thank Muuduu so much for your services. I will definitely come back for any future needs.</review>

I have two orders with them since June 18, 2018 and they hadn't delivered any of it in a month.  They don't have anyone to answer the phone and no one replies back via email.  I feel like they took my money and ran. I complained to BBB, and still nothing.  Prices are cheap but you don't even GET what you pay for.

Update, its now 7/23 and still no reply back from Muuduu!< /text>

I recently ordered a bedroom set using their website. They had a huge selection available and the ordering process was extremely easy.Also, the products were offered at a great price. My bed, dresser and nightstand were delivered on time. They also callled and checked to make sure I received all my orders and ensured that I'm satisfied with my order and the delivery process. I highly recommend them for your furniture needs.<//Review>

Nice furniture, great price. Delivery took WAY longer than expected (4 weeks for a California delivery, when original expected time was 3-14 days). The customer service followed up though along the way when I emailed them about the delay. The delivery was at a super weird time too, at 11PM due to LA traffic, apparently. The delivery drivers and customer service I spoke to were all friendly though. I'd recommend it, if you aren't in a hurry to get your furniture and want to save some money.< /Review>

DO NOT BUY!

BUYER BEWARE!  Cancelled an online transaction via phone and email within 30 mins but my card was still charged for the amount.  Two days later, my card was charged over $7,000 at an electronic surveillance store 3 miles from their store.

Good luck ever getting hold of them after they charge your card.</Text>

Just like most online merchants, we process online payments via third-party payment company and credit card number is never visible to us.\n\nA bad review is just fine when it\'s due but we can\'t allow being associated with criminal behavior so we\'re exploring available legal ways to remove this bogus review.\n\nEven if we couldn\'t find your name in our customer database, it might be possible that you, or someone you know, received bad customer service from us which motivated you to submit a "revenge" review like this. In that case, I invite you to reach out to us with more details, because we\'re looking to help and solve this in a good faith.\n\nThanks,\n\nMuuduu'}</Resp><gmapID>0x80c2d592cc690a03:0x991f00443c4f78a6</gmapID></record>

< Review>
The first time my table showed up, it was damaged and Jack who did the delivery at that time was extremely courteous and professional in his service and took pictures of all the damage and took everything thing back while being profusely apologetic about the damaged goods. Muuduu furniture staff ensured that my replacement table showed up within a week. Excellent service at the time of delivery from Oscar and Eric. They were both professional and communicated the delivery schedule to me from that morning. They went above and beyond what I would have expected of a couple of guys delivering product. I would highly recommend them.< /Review>

Found this place through my mom who was helping me find things for my first home. I found a beautiful 3 pc sectional that I fell in love with! It's everything I wanted. And when I arrived to pick it up there was not one thing that I did not like. I will be back for some more pieces. Thank you Muuduu!!!!!</text>

<Review>Very poor customer service. I was expecting they deliver between 7 - 14 business days(in CA) according to there ads on there website but I waited for 16 business days still they are asking me to wait for additional 5 business days. I asked them to cancel my order and process my refund and the funny thing is I have to wait at least 5 business days for the refund. Guys don't waste your time and money, better you order from other store.< /Review><GmapID>0x80c2d592cc690a03:0x991f00443c4f78a6<//GmapID><user>110709847740786797167</user></record></dataset><record>

<time>1482280734736< /time><text>We saw their site on Google and the rest was history. Muuduu does have the cheapest prices out there in the industry no doubt about it. We furnished our whole house for a dime and didn't run into any trouble at all. Their drivers and assemblers were on point and friendly. Muuduu does have some negative feed backs on some social media sites, but for us, muuduu did an excellent job.

I haven't received my furniture yet, but I MUST SAY that VINCENT was SO GRACIOUS and took so much time with me on the phone to help me find just the right furniture I was looking for!  Thanks for that VINCENT!  And then twice when I called back being EXCITED about when my furniture was going to be delivered I talked to ROXANNA.  She too was SO NICE and helpful giving me detailed information about my upcoming delivery! Thanks for that ROXANNA! My delivery date is set for Wed.-3/29/17, so I'll rate the delivery service I receive along with the quality of the furniture next week after I receive my black leather sectional and my 7-piece glass counter height dining set.  Good job so far MUUDUU FURNITURE, ...keep up the good work!!!!</Text>

This place is very underrated. If you know what you are ordering and you are a person who generally does a bit of research about the product online before buying, then Muuduu Furniture is place to go for you. Nobody can match their deals because of their unique business concept of not maintaining a too extravagant display store. I purchased a dining set for 480 (including delivery and assembly) and nowhere else on internet i got anything below 580 for the same set (not including assembly). Also, Santiago and Frank, their delivery guys delivered the set within a week, did a very good of assembly and were very respectful and nice.</review>

So overall I suggest stopping by here before you make your purchase some where else just to have something to compare it to. Customer service was great even though we got the delivery a bit later than the schedule that was supposed to, but i'm sure know the traffic in LA is crazy so that is acceptable to me.

Price is good. Reliable delivery. Friendly salesperson. A lot of selections on their website. The issue is their showroom which is pretty small, which is probably what is keeping the price down.<//text>

Thank you for a pleasant experience. I know there are lots of bad reviews out there. However, I gave muuduu a chance and them proved me wrong. The merchandise arrived on time and the drivers were very punctual. It took them thirty minutes to assemble a 9 pieces dining set and my kid's daybed. Also, Jenny at the warehouse was very informative and kind.</text>

Worst customer service ever! If I could give zero Stars I would. We have had such a terrible time dealing with muudu furniture. we ordered a couch and a recliner. When delivered, only the recliner showed up and nobody could tell us where the sofa was. Customer service does not get back to you. We have left countless messages and emails with no return. Finally got a hold of somebody 5 days after our shipment went missing. They promised it would be delivered this weekend and said someone would call us on Friday and yet again no phone call on Friday. It is Saturday the day of delivery and no one has called in the morning like they also said they would. Phone just rings and Rings we've left many messages with no call back. We will have to go to the Better Business Bureau. Not sure if we'll ever get the couch we ordered from them! Buyers beware!
*Update: after a long week of leaving countless messages, I found out that they came on a day that was not scheduled and left (with our couch) because we were not home. After much debate on why this was not acceptable, customer service representative John drove the couch to us personally on a Saturday night and helped us get it in to the house, ending this delivery saga nightmare. Thank you John for trying to make right what was overall a very unpleasant experience with Muuduu furniture.< /review>

Absolutely horrible. I'll give the customer service the one star for justification but just the overall experience and quality of the product is below standards that any furniture company should be operating at.

I ordered a measly 300 dollar couch in which the pictures were stunning! I thought I just landed an amazing couch, affordable and ready for delivery within that same day.
I spoke with a man multiple times on the phone, I want to say has an accent, and he had delivery times for that day to pick from at I believe was an 80 dollar same day delivery.
It arrived around 7pm and was on the back of a red truck which had no company information on it. I was approached by two men and literally dropped the couch at my door in a box.
They don't "assemble" the boxed couch for you so I literally sat there with a newborn trying to put the thing together.
After the couch was assembled, I took a step back and felt like a giant compared to the height and size of the thing. They should be selling to elves at this rate! My husband and I could not share a seat together so we had to have our father give us his hand me down couch.
I contacted the rep I originally talked with and he told me once you assemble the couch we can not return.
Ok, so how am I even going to know what it looks like out of the box if you guys don't assemble? And by the time I do assemble it, it's too late to return? Crooks! It's a straight set up and they don't care enough to follow up after that.
I hate this company and I hate every time I see their name in my email about upcoming promotions.</Text>

<text>I love Muuduu! After browsing around Ikea and leaving utterly disappointed in their plain and ugly designs I scheduled an appointment this past Saturday with Muuduu. When I went in there was one person trying to help out 5 or 6 families. I felt like our appointment time was not even necessary (they didn't ask us if we had an appointment). The associate constantly apologized for the delay and told us that more help would be arriving soon. After about 20 minutes we were finally helped and the very friendly associate who helped us was very knowledgeable in all the products.

They recommend that you browse their website before arriving at their store. Come with a list of all the desired item numbers you'd like to see. Their office does not have every furniture piece listed on their website, but if you just let them know what piece you're interested in they'll help you find a similar floor model that matches the color and/or material.

We decided to purchase a dining table set and a sofa. We ordered on that Saturday and it was ready for us on Wednesday. Price was amazing for the quality furniture we received! We love our new dining set and sofa so much! Thank you Muuduu Furniture!

Oh! On a side note, their free delivery starts at $299. We initially were only going to order the dining table set (which was $289) and get the sofa elsewhere, but decided to also get the sofa here for the free delivery.</text></record>

<Review>I placed an order for some expensive furniture over 2 weeks ago - after following up multiple times - they refuse to give me an update on when the order will be delivered. I can understand delays in production but willful neglect in communication has been very disappointing. I probably will have to cancel my order now since they are not responding.< /Review>< Name>

<Text>The worst "no service" company I have ever worked with.  I placed an order over a month ago and am in California.  I was told that the delivery time would be 3 to 10 days...well one month later I have heard nothing from them.  I call them and get the same voice message over and over again...leave a message and no one ever calls back. I email them daily and no one ever returns the emails.  So we are now out a lot of money for a desk, which I am assuming we will never get.  Beyond disgusted with this so called company.   The lack of customer support or service is unacceptable.  DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!!  Unless of course you want  to pay for something that you will never see....< /Text><response>{'time': 1506624313194, 'text': "We should always have clear and prompt communication, Jody, and I can see why it's been frustrating to receive anything other than that.

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>They missed the delivery, no one ever called so I sat around waiting all day. After that I tried to cancel my order and get a refund. I've sent 4 emails, left 2 voicemails, and talked to someone about it once, but after 2 weeks they haven't even tried to contact me and they still have my money.

Buyer beware (then go elsewhere).

Update: Only after I disputed the charge did they reach out to me. They said they were willing to give me refund but I still had to pay for delivery and a 25% restocking fee for something that never left their warehouse.

[Update] - It's been over 6 months and they still have not delivered anything, but they have kept 100% of my money. They won't call me back or respond to my emails. I disputed the charge with my bank and they refused to work with the bank.

<rating>5< /rating><Text>First of all I sympathise with the people who have had negative experience with Muuduu Furniture and posted a negative remark here. But my experience was great.....
I bought this dining set from them which was on sale like 30-40% less then other sellers, the delivery was scheduled within 10 days. delivered by 2 very careful drivers/sales persons. Items arrived in a timely fashion and without any damage. Yeah, I have one remorse that after I paid $29 for delivery they charged me additional $22 saying that I was off their route. Okayyyyy but why was I not charged correct amount when I was buying online.....I guess their website is not up-to-date for freight. No big deal. So I paid $22 to the driver.
So far so good, assembled all my furniture in 2 days (4-5 hours) now I am enjoying the purchase. Will recommend to friends and family and will buy from them again if needed. Thanks

Hi Muuduu,

I was a little skeptical reading all the negative reviews. However, I went with my guts and gave them a chance. I can't speak for other customers but my experience with Muuduu was great.

Very unprofessional.
After order a bed set online, they denied our order because it wasn't available.
We chose an other bed set. After 2 weeks of not having any confirmation of delivery we called and then they assigned a day to delivery the furniture.
The night before we received a phone call letting us know that the bed we had chose was in a bad condition and they didn't have any other available. We needed to cancel the all order or choose a bed without storage, no any other options. Very frustrating! we accept the bed without storage. They applied 5% discount in the bed.
The estimate time of delivery was from 3pm to 7pm. They was going to call us 30 min before the arrival. No phone calls, just the driver ringing at my door.

We also contract a their services to remove my old bed and placed in a recycling area. The truck drivers didn't know that they needed to take care of the old furniture. They ensured us that the old furniture WASN'T going to be placed in a recycling area.< /review>

<review>I ordered an "in stock" item and was called and told it would be delivered in 2 weeks. Then I got a call on the day before scheduled delivery and was told it was on back order and it would be 2 more weeks. I called and after many, many attempts got the manager John. I explained the situation and he assured me that it would be delivered the next week by Sunday. I called on Saturday to be told it was either going to be Tuesday or Wednesday. I called back and cancelled my order after being given the run around for nearly a month. John also stated he didn't care about bad reviews, so I decided to write one anyway. Save your money and your time.< /review>< GmapID>

Couldn't even get to order, I called them several times to try and ask a couple of general questions before placing and order and couldn't get a hold of anyone no matter the extension I pressed, left a couple of voicemails and no one ever got back to me, I called for 5 days straight at 9am 1pm and 3 or 4pm everyday who runs a company like that? It makes me nervous to purchase from them because clearly if something goes wrong no ones going to be able to tell me what's happening< /Review>

<Review>These dudes are no joke. Great Prices! and the customer service went above and beyond. I ordered a bed saturday at 6:00pm and they delivered that night!  How'd they do that!  John the delivery guy and his Bro (didn't catch his name) were punctual and very accommodating. Also, The quality of the product was outstanding especially for the price.  I'm impressed and will be shopping here again. Recommending to Family and friends</Review>< Pictures>

<Text>I ordered a dresser, coffee table and couch from Muuduu. It took a long time to get here, but the coffee table is beautiful. However, the dresser had large cracks in the wood when it arrived. They sent a replacement dresser (after MANY phone calls), and the corner of that dresser was damaged. It has been over a week, and I still haven't heard anything about a refund or another replacement dresser. They also cancelled my order for the couch without telling me. It has been a nightmare dealing with Muuduu Customer Service because they almost never answer the phone, and it takes them at least a week to return my phone calls/online requests. So my experience with Muuduu has been mostly bad, but I am pleased with the coffee table.</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmap_id>

Thank you for the expedited service and great products. We were a little skeptical reading all the nagative reviews out there but muuduu proved us wrong. John went above n beyond for our order in a short notice. They delivered and assembled all of our products as promised,which was way ahead of their booked schedule, and we are so grateful.

I ordered a couch 2-3 weeks ago, got a call it would be delivered 2-3 days ago, I didn’t get any call or update. Then I called the customer service twice-they never picked up the call. Then left a message online, they told me it would be delivered today or tomorow (  I was suppose to get a call on the delivery) I never did.... I just called them now, the lady told me my product was out of order... WHAT?!?! after 2 weeks and they kept giving me false update. What a SCAM!!!! Be aware< /text>

Horrible customer service.   They are completely unresponsive to email or voice messages.   I placed an order for a nightstand a full month ago which is showing a status of "processing," stating that orders will be shipped within 14 business days.  All attempts to contact via phone have put me to voicemails which have not been returned.  Emails also receive no response.  They are quick to charge your credit card for full payment but that is apparently the only thing they do well.<//text>

Horrible service and experience.
I should have known from the first time I tried to place my order that this company is a disaster.  I tried to place an order online and the credit card portion was not working. So I called the main line and told them  I was trying to place an order on line and it wouldn't go through, could they help me. The guy was rude and had trouble even finding what I wanted to order even though I gave him the SKU and the description from their own site. Eventually he found it and then asked me how much it was, as though he wanted to make sure the price he saw and what I saw were the same. . . ? I asked if they deliver to Texas, as I know they are based in CA. He said yes and right now shipping is free and will be in a week, but only if I place the order immediately, which is exactly what I was trying to do. After all of this he said "you know, you can place the order on line" ! No actually I can't that is why I called you. I eventually just gave up and placed an order using paypal online and that went through. But the problems didn't stop. I never got a confirmation email. So I called and asked if my order was indeed received and when I can expect delivery. They said yes it was received, and sent an email, but delivery would be 2-3 weeks. I placed my order on 7/7. On 7/21 I used their online system to check on my order and asked when I can expect delivery. They responded with "we regret to inform you that Texas is not in our delivery zone. I will forward this to financing and get this order cancelled and refunded for you." So if I didn't ask were they never going to tell me my furniture was not coming? I've lost two weeks waiting on them for furniture. I could have gone elsewhere and had it delivered already. I cannot believe that a company that handles orders this way is still even in business. Good luck if you decide to buy from them! I am worried I won't even get a refund after seeing how they operate.<//Text>

I ordered a Beckett  dining room set back in February.  I love the dining room set but there have been issues since the beginning.   First disappointment was that I paid for assembly but the 2 men that delivered it said they didn't assemble.  I was reimbursed the assembly fee but anyone that is not strong and familiar w/ tools would have had a problem.   2nd problem, table was missing a rivet cap on the side of it.  I called and was told they couldn't replace that single item.  Ok.....I can over look that since I love the table.    Last issue is the stretcher for the bench:  the wood is cracking in half.  I called and they sent out a new stretcher that arrived damaged.  Since then, I have called and e-mailed.  Each time they ask me to send pictures (which I have sent about 5 times now) and PROMISE they will get back w/ me.   Latest promise was to have new stretcher delivered this last Saturday which I stayed home for all day and they no-showed.  Very disappointing and frustrating.  I won't order from this company again.

Following up on my last post:  I was promised 2 more times to have the stretcher replaced.   They did come and delivered the wrong piece.  Contacted them and again, sent pictures and order # and promised correct piece would be here last Saturday.   Again.....no show.   I contacted them today and they tell me no one promised me a delivery of the piece this last Saturday.   I had the text and proof that they did.   Ridicules!    I told them I am done with them.   I will have a new piece made myself out of my own pocket.  What a lousy way to do business.< /text>

<Review>DO NOT ORDER FROM THEM.
It was such a horrible experience! When I ordered, I was told to choose if I want my sofa to be left or right sided. I wasn't sure what it means so I googled it and chose left.
Then, Muuduu never called me to confirm the order like they say they will. I was the one to contact them multiple time until finally they answered my email.
The delivery guy showed up and REFUSED TO CARRY THE FURNITURE!!! He said I need to pay him for that. I told him this is his job and he said it's too heavy for him! My partner ended up carrying it himself just because we didn't have enough cash on us to pay the stupid deliver guy.
I called Muuduu to complaint and could not reach them! I emailed multiple times with no answer (until this momeny by the way. They don't guve a damn).
When I opened the package, I realized they sent me the wrong order! I called more than 50 times and THEY NEVER PICK UP THE PHONE!
This was such a nightmare for me. I had to threaten them I will dispute the charge to get some attention, and then when they finally called me back they told me it's my fault (??????). DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY.< /Review>< Pics>

If I could give them negative stars I would.  They didn't have the bunk bed I was considering in their showroom but I was assured by the salesman that it was the similar in build to the one that was on the showroom floor. It was a total bait and switch because what I received was flimsy and poorly designed.  The "wood" cracked, chipped and dinged while I was trying to put together this 100 piece puzzle of a bunk bed.  The wood that they used may have well been Balsa because of how easily it got damaged while I was trying to put this bed together. The instruction manual was very hard to follow.  I got about halfway through putting this bed together when I gave up.  I figured that I'd just return the bed because even if I did put it together correctly, I didn't feel safe having my children sleep in it.

This is when I was told that there was a restocking fee of 35%!  I was also informed that the boxes had to be unopened in order for them to accept my return.  How can one try out the furniture if they don't open the boxes?  It took me multiple phone calls to even get anyone on the phone to get an RA (return authorization) number to return the bed.

That's when I really started to feel like I was scammed.  Muuduu knows that they are pushing subpar furniture and does not stand behind their products.  If they did, why would they make it so difficult and have so many deterrents to return their furniture?

Scam company selling very cheaply made, poorly designed Chinese knock offs.

<Review>One of the things I always tell my friends who are shopping for furniture is to copy down the part/model # and shop around because most of the furniture stores order from the same catalogs.  You can find the EXACT SAME product at two different stores with a price tag difference as high as $400 dollars.  That said, Muuduu Furniture is hands down one of the best priced furniture stores in the LA area.  I've gotten a bed frame that was at least $200 cheaper than other stores and a sofa that was cheaper than what I could find on the internet.  During both purchases, I must have called the store over 10 times to address my questions, change my order, and make sure my order arrives on time.  The staff has been very patient with me and I have no problem with the delivery process and the quality of the products we received.  I would highly recommend Muuduu Furniture to anybody for its low price and the staff's attentive service.< /Review>< pictures>

<Text>We have the bunk bed with the stairs that also serve as drawers. The bed itself is solid, but the drawers are such poor quality. The tracks are flimsy and are constantly coming off from the drawers and the frame of the bed. This is kid furniture so it should be very durable. Ironically, the drawers are for my son who is disabled so he can't even open the drawers so there is no opportunity for kids to be rough with them. I'm constantly putting the drawers and the tracks back together. Too much work - especially when one has four young children, one of whom is severely disabled. We always get compliments on the way it looks, but the drawers are awful.</Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response>< GmapID>

This company is disgraceful!!! I ordered something from them online. They charged my card and never sent the item. I called 5 times. I finally got a call back from someone telling me that the cost of shipping would be the same as the item, hence they haven't sent it. BUT THEY DIDN'T CALL ME.  When I asked to speak with a manager to discuss why I was not contacted and why my payment wasn't refunded, the representative had to take my contact number down to have the manager contact me. A week has gone by. The manager hasn't contacted me. I've called and left a message again. And now I have to dispute the charge on my credit card. This is AWFUL customer service. I don't recommend people sending their business to people who treat their customers this way!< /Review>

Poor customer service. My furniture was scheduled to be delivered on a Sunday between 1-8 PM. They called at 10:15 PM to inform me they were still at least two hours away and would arrive around 12:30 AM. I declined to accept a delivery at 12:30 in the morning. Two weeks later I still do not have my furniture. I’m beginning to think this company maybe a scam. They have already charged my credit card for the purchase. However, I have yet to receive an invoice which was to be emailed to me. When you call they don’t answer. You have to leave a message for them. Who delivers furniture at 12:30 AM?<//Text>

BE AWARE !!! CHECK WITH BBB "Better Business Bureau" This company ripped me off. They sent me a power sofa that doesn't work. They have told me multiple times they are going to fix it yet six months has gone by. This has been the worst experience I have ever had purchasing online. I hope you read this before it's to late. Companies like this shouldn't be around.<//Text>

<review>Stay away from these people. They will take your money, then you are going to wait forever for the delivery, they will deliver defective broken items and good luck trying to return them. They do not respond to emails. When you call them and if someone finally picks up, they say they will take a message and someone will call you back right away. No one ever calls you back. When you call again, they tell you the same thing. After sending at least 7 emails and 3 phone calls asking to return the defective order, I had to get my bank involved. I finally got a response from them 3 weeks later informing me there's a 25% restocking fee on returning a defective broken item. Save your time, nerves, and money and give your business to a trusted provider, not those bandits.< /review>< pics>

My wife and I ordered a couch 2-3 weeks ago, she got a call it would be delivered 2-3 days ago, However she didn’t get any call or update. She then called the customer service twice-they never picked up the call....left a message online, they told her it would be delivered today or tomorow (  She was suppose to get a call on the delivery) She never did.... Now she just called them now, the lady told her our couch was out of order... WHAT?!?! after 2 weeks and they kept giving us false update. What a SCAM!!!!</Review>

<review>The first time we ordered from Muuduu had been a great experience. The sofa and bed that we ordered were in excellent condition. They tried their best to meet our delivery window. Despite it being late at night and confusion with the address, the delivery people didn't complain of anything. So with that said, we ordered again another bed and mattress for our other bedroom, and I accidentally ordered the wrong size of mattress. Jennifer whose from customer service was nice enough to communicate with us and make sure if we weren't making a mistake. She was very kind in assisting us over the phone on how to go around with the adjustment of the payment and availability of the products, and to meet the delivery window that we gave. Two thumbs up Muuduu!</review>< resp>

Worst place ever!! I ordered from them about 2 weeks ago and still no furniture. I didn’t go to work the day we scheduled to have my furniture delivered and they never came. I emailed them and they said they will let me know when they will deliver it because they are “changing warehouses.” They didn’t give me an specific date. I’ve been trying to call them and it sends me straight to a voicemail without an option to talk to a person. I’ve been emailing them and they don’t reply. It’s ridiculous!! I want to a full refund at this point but I can’t even get an email back. I’m so disappointed!< /review>

I made an order last week online (from Florida) for a sectional with a note asking for delivery before my husband's deployment. I
paid through PayPal and payment was processed yet no communication was made on their part as to whether this request could be accommodated. I called Friday and no one answered, so I left a voicemail.  I emailed Saturday and no one responded. I called today       and no one answered. I tried different prompts to see if I could talk to an actual person. It seems the owner is more interested in responding to customer complaints than customer phone calls. I am assuming they will make up an excuse, as I have seen on these reviews already, about it being a busy week due to the holiday, etc. Yet, their website says they are an appointment only company...Mind you, they processed my payment for 900$ in a very timely manner! At this point, I want a refund and will take my business where it is valued. I read the reviews prior to purchase and now realize that the bad reviews were very spot on. If the owner sees this before an employee emails or calls me back please cancel my order and refund my money otherwise I will be disputing with my PayPal.< /Text>

<Text>It would be nice if Muuduu answered their phone more often, but they make it right w/exceptional customer service.  Often times we forget that a company is a 'team' and every employee [regardless of their position] plays an important role in the operations of a company ...including the delivery person.  The guy that delivered my furniture ...his name is Oscar.  He could have dropped off the XL heavy large furniture box curb side in front of my office bldg. that doesn't have an elevator, but with great effort & exceptional experience ...he managed to get the XL heavy large furniture box up a narrow staircase & low ceiling clearance without hitting the wall or breaking a hallway light in one piece & rolled it all the way back into my office where it was to be assembled all by himself.  Truly outstanding customer service that goes above & beyond the call of duty.  I would buy all my furniture from Muuduu ...because of an extraordinary service experience from Oscar, that really makes this company stand out from their completion.

<text>I ordered a adjustable bed June 14th, but there was a long delay in shipping because their warehouse was moving. I cancelled order end of June, have not received refund yet, it is almost end of August.  They replied that my request has been forwarded to finance department for review, but no refund or response since then. It has been almost two months waiting for refund, tried to call them but they do not answer.
May be they are out of business? Or gtrying to be out of business running business like this?

<Review>*Update: Customer support rep contacted us next day and the refund was processed immediately.
------------------------------------------------------------------
Worst customer experience ever. We purchased furniture which turned out to be out of stock. They told us it would take two months to back order, so we cancelled the order. They actually put the order on-hold without letting us know. We found out only after a week when we called to find out what's wrong with our order. Now we're trying to get a refund and it's been three days and we called them twice... no luck so far. no confirmation and no refund. We have to open a dispute through PayPal for a refund.</Review>< Pictures>

We were contemplating if we should go ahead with Muuddu or not after reading a few negative reviews. However they had similar if not more collections from other online sites and prices even lesser . We took a risk and got a sofa and love seat .. we received it in couple of weeks . I would have liked the communications to be better cos at one point I doubted my decision and they delivered it though .. it was perfect everything packed so well .. I appreciate n would definitely come back to Muuddu for more of our needs ..< /review>

<rating>1</rating><review>***PLEASE READ BEFORE PURCHASING***

We had found Muudu and ordered a set of couches because of the low price.  The couches were delivered within the 2 week window, however the buttons were the wrong color.  Thankfully we had noticed during delivery and rejected the set.  We immediately called Daniel, and was told that we'd have to pay extra to get the correct color buttons since the couches were delivered.  We didn't agree and Daniel cancelled the order, refunded some of the funds while charging us the restocking and delivery fees.  We had to contest the charges through Citibank, and about 3 months later received a full refund.

However we did several things right - and please take heed to such advise before ordering:

1) I would recommend to shop elsewhere.  Reading google and yelp reviews paints a not so favorable picture of this establishment.

2) If you do purchase, DO NOT PAY WITH CASH OR CHECK!!  Use a credit card!!  They charge more if you pay with a credit card, however the extra security is definitely worth it.  You could contest charges with your credit card, however with cash, you're at their mercy!

3) Inspect any and all furniture before they bring it inside your house.  If anything is broken, the wrong color, or not what you ordered, DO NOT ACCEPT IT.  Reject the item.  If you do reject the item, you will be entitled to a full refund.  You'll have to contest the charges with your credit card, however you will get it back - hence the importance of the above point.  It sounds silly, but per the UCC, if a merchant doesn't deliver what you ordered, you are entitled to a refund.  But you have to reject the item.  If you receive the item, then you may be subject to a restocking fee.

Good luck!<//review>< pictures>

Biggest mistake ordering from them!! Ordered a bed online on 11/3 and 15 mins later I changed my mind and canceled it by phone and online. I was told I would get a refund 3-5 days. 11/14 now and still waiting for my refund. I've been calling and have actually gotten through twice but every time I call they tell me to wait a couple more days. I should've read these reviews before ordering because by the looks of it, I will continue to wait forever. At this point, I'm ready to also report this furniture store and just dispute the amount with my bank.<//text>

When it comes to my shopping experiences, Im real big with customer service.. Its very important to me to feel comfortable with products im going to purchase. Making my purchases @Muuduu furniture was an awesome experience.  Joseph assisted me , answered my questions i had.  He had patience with me, friendly, he was very professional at the same time made me feel as a customer that i was important and that i left there very happy and and that i was #1. Ask for Joseph, he represents Muuduu furniture, and will make sure that you are taken care of and answers your questions.  If he doesn't have a answer for u, he will make sure one of his awesome team members will be able to answer. This company will not leave you unhappy and feeling like your just some regular customer, your like family.  Everyone there are great! Im definitely going to be back. Thank you Joseph!!! Thank you Muuduu Furniture!< /Review>

I placed my order (nearly $1k) two months ago for bunk beds for my twins. Everything seemed great because 10 days later I got a call to schedule delivery. We were going to be out of town on the dates they selected, so I asked to schedule the week after. The customer service rep at the time was great. I got an email confirming the note was added to my account to call back to reschedule. This email was on 7/7/17.
Since then, NOTHING. I emailed them at the end of July to inquire. I got a pleasant response promising a reply within 24 hours. NO REPLY. I emailed back twice. NO REPLY.
I began to call this past week, and left messages. NO CALLS BACK. I stated calling again and kept pressing any option until I got a live voice. On Tues (8/15) I spoke with Jay (woman) who looked into my account and was going to flag it for the shipping department to call me back by end of the day. NO CALL. I called all morning today and it kept going to voicemail at all extensions, so I didn't bother leaving a message. Kindly, someone names Paul returned my call (maybe from Caller ID). He was super polite and professional and apologetic. However, Paul couldn't help me because only Vincent can handle out of state deliveries. He gave me his direct extension. (Which doesn't work). He told me Vincent would call before 4pm (Shocker here, NO CALL BACK). He even transferred me to Vincent's voicemail (the same non-descript mailbox as every other mailbox I've reached so far). I left my info yet again.
I am feeling beyond hopeless that I've lost $1k for a bed that I will likely never get and have to buy again from somewhere reputable. As I've read all the reviews tonight , an overwhelming majority of 1 star ones have been in the past 2 months. So I'm convinced this company is near bankruptcy. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!!!!!
Here's the most baffling part. Why fake it? Why fake customer service and why did Paul even attempt to call me back?</Review>

<Review>Took Muduu 6 months to deliver my couch. And when it finally came it was stained with a drop of water, which surprisingly completely ruined it! I am out over $1200.00! They did not honor their own discount offer which is totally illegal (its called false advertising). And to top it off, the owner is a slave driver. He has one delivery person driving across the entire country. The poor guy works 18 hour days and has no help! If you're thinking about purchasing from this place I strongly suggest you take your money and your business elsewhere.<//Review>< Rate>

<text>Furniture came in great condition. Was packed well and Vincent was extremely helpful. I went to so many furniture stores here in town and no one wanted to help me with the price. They wouldn't call me back, or they would give me some lame excuse why they couldn't match Muuduu's prices. I dont mind spending money, but i wanted a deal. No one wanted to give me that deal except Muuduu. I finally found one person in town that would help, but when i spoke to Vincent, he made me feel like he really wanted my business. Wow what a concept....make the customer feel like they are the reason you are in business. I run a small business and customers are the reason any business exists. We treat them like they deserve to be treated. Vincent made me feel like that. If anyone here in my town would have made me feel like I mattered as a customer, I would have paid more. I would highly recommend muuduu.< /text></record>

<Pictures>None<//Pictures><Text>2 weeks later:
Customer service said my item would be delivered today.  I called to verify. Driver said my order is not on truck.  I will not have the table in time for when I need it.  Completely disappointed.   My husband and I are VERY upset about this.  Beginning to wonder. . . .is it a scam?  I was already charged for the table and have received no item or update.  Maybe this is whey their BBB rating is an "F".

3 days since I left a message:
No call back yet, so I called back again to inquire about my order.  It was a quick 2 minute phone conversation from "Johnny" in customer service saying he apologized that my item was not delivered and that it would be delivered this Friday.  No complaints from my end.  Just happy I was told it was coming.

Later that evening, I got another phone call from "Jessica" at Muuduu saying that she doesn't know where Johnny got the info from and that my item is not in stock and wouldn't be delivered til next year.  I was a bit upset that I wasn't informed about this over the last week and a half.  Johnny got on the phone and wow!  THE MOST DISGUSTING, and UNPROFESSIONAL TREATMENT I have ever received in my life from a "Customer Service" Rep!  I let him know I was upset that I was NEVER informed of the delay.  He says, "did you not Google the manufacturer?  If you did you would know they are from Canada and they obviously need more time!".  Of course I didn't do research on the manufacturer!  I trusted his word as a "Customer Service" rep that said "it was a popular item" and that it is "IN STOCK".  Why would I question him and do research?  Then he continues by saying that "they receive $50,000 orders and my order is so small they only make $50 off of it".  What does that have to do with anything?  I don't care if I only paid $10 for something.  I'm still expecting the product. He continues with, "did I say I PROMISE you'd get the item?'  NO JOHNNY! You never said that.  You said "THE ITEM IS POPULAR AND IS IN STOCK".   I am embarrassed to say that I argued back at this uneducated man and told him that there was obviously a miscommunication.  I said that since I waited this long then I don't mind waiting longer and to just continue with the process. You wouldn't believe....he says, "please remove your  bad review so I can process your order.  You will not get your order unless you fix your review."  What?  I cant receive an item that I already paid for because of my review?  He hated that I questioned him.  He said, "you know, I don't do this job for fun.  I have to do it for my family so be a good person and fix your review or I will cancel your order....to acknowledge that you misunderstood"  What?  I misunderstood?  No! You didn't give me the right information as a customer service rep.  You said it was in stock!  Why cant I receive an item that I already paid for because of a review.  Don't understand how I had to be THREATENED to get something I paid for.  I was threatened even though I already accepted his apology for yelling at me over the phone the past 10 minutes!

That said, I can't say that Muuduu is terrible, because Jessica was so professional and very rational over the phone.  Actually, when I called the past weekend, the line got transferred to the delivery truck driver, and he was such a pleasant man to speak to.  From what I understand, even the owner of the company has been amazing with customer service.  My terrible review is because of "JOHNNY".  Maybe it was a language barrier because of his heavy accent, but either way, no customer service rep should EVER speak to a customer the way JOHNNY spoke with me over the phone.

I'm not saying not to order from Muuduu.  I'm sure their items are amazing at decent prices if the process goes smooth and as planned, but just be aware of the attitude and terrible service you might get specifically from "JOHNNY".  I recommend asking for Jessica.  Unfortunately this was the only experience I've had with Muuduu.<//Text><time>1513816073779< /time>< user>

I ordered a dresser and bed frame from Muuduu. I had to work a bit to have them price match from another website but they ultimately agreed. Overall I would say it was a good experience and would buy again from muuduu. Only thing is I would ask management to work on customer support. Phone support from muuduu is horrible. You will have to leave a message anytime you have a question or want to place an order on the phone.

Pros:
-price matched
-good quality furniture
-faster shipping than quoted.

Cons:
-horrible communication
-lost pieces of furniture that took some time to recover.
-damaged panel. It was touched up and looks ok.</text>

Not sure how this company operates, but they are anything but traditional. Customer service is horrible. I was supposed to receive my bed in 1 to 2 weeks. It took longer. I was told they would deliver on wednesday. Then got a call stating it would be changed to thursday. For heavens sake, people work and need to know time lines to schedule a delivery!!! This company has integrity issues. Thursday comes, no call from the drivers as indicated. No delivery made on Thursday. No phone number to reach the drivers to verify if or when they are coming. This company is not recommended. Avoid waisting your time and don't order from these knuckheads!</review>

I read some of the negative comments on here and have some problem believe it. So my wife and i went to the place ourself and told the guy that they had alot of negative review on yelp and here. He told me you cant please everyone. So i ask him if i do purchase from them how long will it be until i get it. He told me by thursday or Saturday cuz i was there in person he can make the delivery quicker if i was to do it on my own. It will be on the same week that i purchase. I was there on a Monday. So i was persuade. So i decide to buy the furniture. Thursday gone by and got a phone call that my furniture isn't going to be delivery by next week. So i call the guy and ask where is my stuff he said he will look into and gave me a call back. Did not get a phone call back on Friday. So i call on Saturday no one answer and i left a voicemail. So my wife call on monday since they closed on Sunday and left them a message to call us back. He call me back and apologize and said that my shipping names is different then on the buyer address that why it taking so long and i need to fill out a form confirming the other person name and my name on receiving the package.  But the other person name was my wife because i wont be home and she will. But the thing is we live together so it doesnt matter. It not like shipping it to someone else address. Then he said he will book me on Saturday because it was the best he can do. So i just saying. I got screw. And they should really change their 2 to 7 days of delivery if you live in So Cal. It false advertisements.< /Text>

<text>Do not, I repeat DO NOT buy from muuduu  unless you want to be agitated and lied too. The owner promised to have my items delivered on Sat since I am extremely busy then called and said it be the following Tuesday and will be 1st thing in the am route. Let me tell you they came but in the late afternoon with no updates I had to keep calling them all dayto see what was going on and when they got to my house, muuduu forgot my dining table which I still don’t have.Jess the CS rep said  they’d deliver for am but they have yet to come and it’s the afternoon with no phone call.This company is a joke when it comes to service. You get what you pay for and service ain’t one of them. The muuduu drags their feet when it comes to delivering products in a timely manner and keeping their word until they get your money Muuduu is a JOKE!!!</text>< Resp>

I ordered a corner desk from their website on December 11th hoping to get it in time for Christmas as a present.  I could have gone with a couple of other sellers including Amazon, but I decided to go with a local, California store. The shipping instructions said it might take up to 21 business days since I live farther north in California.  Needless to say, it didn't come before Christmas or even before New Years.

I reached out to customer service on January 6th asking for an update to the delivery and delivery date.  It is now January 12th and I haven't received an answer to my email nor do I have my desk. I will be calling customer service tomorrow and cancelling the order as well as my credit card company.

I won't order from them again.  Next time, I will go with Amazon since they understand customer service.<//Text>

I placed an order June 12, 2018 for a bed frame and never received my order. I contacted customer service multiple times without any response. Their phone number is useless as it doesn't let you leave a message and just directs you back to their website. No actual person to contact. I am filing a dispute in my credit  card to hopefully get something back.< /review>

<review>My biggest mistake with this company. Purchased a Sofa in  December. Used this sofa for 2 months, then found that all cushions and springs had very bad quality and Began to fall through. Called to customer service. Every day they told me that we will call you back. Finely I rich somebody only in march. They said that they will replace a sofa next week. Waited for 2 weeks nobody showed up. Called back to the customer service, asked about my complaints. So, new sofa was delivered in April. My wife did not check sofain this time and nobody told her to do it. Driver and delivery guys left so fest . ..
Couple minutes later my wife found that new sofa completely broken. Damaged, and has different sits hights. She called back fo drivers, nobody respond. Next week called back to customer service, that said that they will change this sofa next week. Same story... called them every day. They newer call back. Last Saturday 06/03/17,  finally they said that they will return my money back. But today 06/06/17 that said that they don't care what's going on, and they don't want to return my money back. Today I'm starting complaining about it everywhere. Now looking for  lawyer. Already found few companies who business inspections and investigations.... now this is my principal, but I will show them who is right.

<review>***This review is based on poor warehouse/distribution/customer care representative experiences; All which rank amongst the worst experience I’ve ever encountered from a business. That’s saying a lot when I work in the industry myself****

What happened:

I Ordered a bedframe for my toddler child for Christmas. They said it was going to be late for the holiday. This was not an issue at all; I get it. The real problem was when it was delivered they forgot the hardware to build the bedframe. This is an inconvenience, but still I’ll make do if they can get this to me in a timely manner.

...Here’s where the problems really start...

I speak to a lady on the phone, she says they’ll send it out Tuesday (I called Friday before NYE). She said because i called so late that they won’t send it out until after the holiday. Ummm what?! First off it was delivered without the parts; how is this my fault?! I called a soon a so unpacked it!  Needless to say if there’s a customer service issue such as this where they forgot the hardware to complete the order, then they should be expediting that hardware to me at the fastest rate possible which would have been Saturday delivery (this is common practice in the industry,  and retail even!)  I don’t get anything until Tuesday afternoon.
At this point I’m thinking, “ OK whatever, moving on...that’s the way they wanna run their business that’s their own prerogative.”
So I start assembling the bed.  Only I’m still missing the most crucial pieces of hardware to complete the bedframe; and that’s the end caps to hold the slats in place so that the mattress can rest on the bed frame!  So now I’m thinking OK this is a Mickey Mouse shop operation.

Call again...

This time the representative has the tenacity and the nerve to say that I should’ve been more specific and telling them that when I missing the hardware to the furniture set that they should’ve said hardware AAAAND the slat pieces?!  I’m losing my mind at this point.  To be accused or ridiculed because of an error that they have made now twice?!? I don’t think so.  We’re talking about the vernacular I choose in saying that they didn’t send me what was supposed to be sent.

UNREAL.

This very minute I still have yet to get a callback from anyone from customer service or the manager supervisor in which I asked to call me personally and I don’t have the necessary pieces in order to finish the Bedframe.

My child is now been without a bed and has been sleeping in his parents bed since December 26. The current Date is January 3, 2018.  I have no idea when these items will be arriving.

With service like this take your business elsewhere and order from any other company because this company doesn’t deliver...all puns intended.

ZERO STARS.<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Don’t let them take your driver license when they deliver. They might misuse your personal information.
I think they took my personal information from my driver licence, and used it to threatening me. The reason I think they misused my personal information from my driver license was that Amazon said Amazon didn’t give my information to Muuduu.
When I called or emailed them, they never replied, but when I couldn’t take there phone, they threatend me, but Amazon said they are not allowed to treaten me after reviewing the case.
I may look for the way to report the threatening case which was totally illegal.
BTW, when I had a chance to talk to them, the customer didn’t sound like a customer support because she didn’t try to help me at all, but I think they should’ve said sorry at least.
I wish I can give the negative 5 stars.</text>< Pics>

I ordered a sectional sofa in mid-July and since then cannot get anyone to tell me what the status is 6 weeks later. Most of the time you get voice mail when calling and even if you leave a vm, no one calls back and just as bad with email correspondence. On the few occasions someone did actually answer, I was told that they had to check with shipping and get back to me, but of course no one did. Finally I received a text stating that the item was out for delivery this past Saturday and as expected, "no call-no show!" The people that work there are either totally incompetent or are running some scam. This has been one of the worst "customer service" experiences ever. I usually don't write "bad reviews", but this is beyond a joke and these idiots need to know that publically!< /Text>

Horrible customer service. They never answer my phone calls and emails after purchase is made. I will never come back to this site for any future purchase and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. If you make any purchase from them and need some customer service and support afterwards, just expect endless calls and no response what so ever.< /Text>

<Review>I've place an order with this company over a month ago, still haven't received my package. Although I've seen the reviews I thought well we all are entitled to our opinions, let me give them a chance to prove others wrong. Well I was wrong and those reviews about unpleasant service with them are very true.They don't call you at all to keep you in the loop so you have to keep calling . I've heard so many excuses: oh yeah we'll have a delivery on the 26th or the one that was to be delivered to you was broken so we're expecting a shipment or it's arrived and you should soon receive a call from the shipping department. Nonsense,total waste of time. Don't even bother save yourself the heartache. Their customer service is a pain. This is a not so happy customer. If delivered and satisfied with my order I might revisit these statements but until then Muuduu Furniture is 👎</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1501332785238, 'text': 'Hello.

I ordered my sectional almost a month ago. I have spent a lot of time on the phone with them and waiting for call backs about my order. Apparently the problem is with the shipping department. At this point the owner should deliver them himself if he has so much trouble with shipping department. I can't rate the quality yet.< /review>

We ordered $5,727 worth furniture from Muuduu. They delivered a broken furniture. Not willing to take a return or refund. We ordered $5,727 worth furniture from Muuduu Furniture by placing the order on the phone with their sales person (John). They delivered the furniture ontime, but the legs of the sofa are broken. We immediately contacted them to inform the damage. They asked us to take pictures of the broken furniture and sent it to them. We did send all the pictures from all angles. We also noted in the delivery note from the delivery company that the furniture is broken. Since then we contacted Muuduu furniture at least 100 times to resolve the issue. They kept telling us that they need to work with the transportation company and resolve the issue. Its been more than 3 months and they haven't resolved it. We spend $5727 and left with a broken furuniture sitting in our living room. They stopped taking our calls, if they take it, they are not returning the calls.

Dont buy anything from them.</text>

I ordered a dining room set on june 16th and still have not received my order. I called the customer service line several times and left voicemails with no return call. Doesnt matter what time you call the customer service line it will always be busy, i have yet to get a live person on the phone. After sending 2 emails,  i received an apology email stating issues with their shipping company. Had i known it would take more than a month to receive my order ,i would have never ordered from this company. I sent an email today requesting an  estimated delivery date or refund my money.
... still waiting
Update on my order. Was able to cancel the order on august 18th but still no refund and no return calls or emails. Going to report it to BBB. This company is a scam.<//review>

I read most of their reviews and decided to give it a try since they have been receiving lots of 5 stars. Little did I know .. I made a decision I would soon regret.

I made an appointment for 10 AM to view their sectional couches. I arrived at 1010 AM and the front doors were locked. I had to call a couple times until someone picked up and said they would notify the people inside. I had to wait outside for at least 10 more minutes until someone came to unlock the door. As I walked in and went upstairs to their showroom, Daniel greeted us and didn't realize we were coming and mentioned Friday's are for them to prepare shipments. He was not notified of the appointment but said he will gladly take us. He was very polite and courteous. I would give him a 4 star because his customer service was not bad at all. However, when we ordered our couch and paid, he told us he would be able to have the couch here in 1 hour (Since I had work at 1 and it was 1040AM) from the other facility (Riverside ~30 mins away)  He offered their delivery service (30$) but before I came I was informed from their phone representative that they had it in stock so we brought our truck so we can load it ourselves. But that didn't work out. So we left and went to grab food. An hour passes by and there is no phone call ... We decided to stop by but the doors are locked and there is nobody working in the back loading area. It is now 12pm. I call their phone number at least 5-6 times and nobody picks up. So I decided to try the door again and luckily it was unlocked! If it wasn't I don't think they would have even noticed us outside. Daniel, said it would take 30 more mins. Note* it is now 1215 so it has already been 1 and 35 mins since we ordered the couch which should have been enough time. It is now 1250 and they inform us it is going to take 20 more minutes. My boyfriend and I are calm, collective, & understanding cause we know what it is like to run a business. However this is pretty much unacceptable. I'm already late for work and your business is obviously unprofessional and unreliable since you can't even provide us with a correct time or even inform us properly. We went in at 110 pm, to ask what's taking so long and Daniel called the driver on speakerphone and it seemed as if the driver was giving Daniel the run around by saying "oh yeah we're around that area" rather than giving him an actual ETA. The driver (Jose) told Daniel he will be about 1-2 more mins. Again 20 more mins have passed. They finally arrive at 130. And my furniture is here. Great. I'm supposed to be excited but after 3 hours of waiting, I'm over it.

Arrival: 1010 AM
Placed order: 1040 AM
Estimated time for shipment: 1 hour
Actual time for shipment: 2 hours 50 minutes
Time of shipment arrival: 130 PM

*** I will be back with updates on the packaging and the item itself.<//Text>

I really wanted to rate this company with 5 stars but their follow up has been abysmal. I placed my order on 4/11/17 for 4 pieces of furniture. 3 of them arrived in late April after 1 am on a Saturday after the truck was cited for several violations that had to be corrected before they were allowed to enter AZ. The driver kept in touch but the delivery person did not speak English and was rough with the unloading. One part (a mirrored back) was broken on delivery. I contacted muuduu and after several attempts (have to keep calling until a person answers), Jennifer was awesome at apologizing and promised to get me a replacement part and said the 4th piece was on backorder, which was not noted in the delivery email. I received a replacement part on May 18, shattered due to poor packing. Jennifer again promised to send it out, including the replacement top for my damaged coffee table and the backordered item by direct UPS at their expense. Two weeks later I was told that my order was going out on a truck to ensure that the mirror piece did not break again. After 5 days of waiting, the truck never arrived and when I finally reached Liliana on the phone, she said their truck had a problem and when they had to switch to a smaller truck my order was removed. Nice that no one told me that, their customer call center kept repeating for 5 days that the driver would call me.  It is now July 7 and although the shipment was scheduled to leave on June 15 via truck again (Jennifer was on vacation and they had no record of the direct ship promise), I haven't been able to reach a human being and have sent several emails. I received an autoreply that someone would call me and still no call. It is now almost 3 mths since my original order and apparently they have no interest in delivering the 4th piece that has never arrived, nor in correcting the 2 damaged parts. I'm beyond upset. Unless you can go pickup your furniture in person, delivery is an unacceptable method of using this company. The only upside is that I like my furniture. Other than that, I have no recommendations for buying from them ever again, and can't understand why no one there feels any obligation to deliver my 4th (fully paid for) piece of furniture! Absolutely horrible service despite the human beings that you can actually reach always saying the right things, they can't make it happen. Where is my delivery???!! 😠

July 29 update: still no delivery! I spoke with Daniel who promised he would fix everything. Then the truck wasn't full and since he couldn't say when it would leave he wanted to refund my server and offered $50 if I would keep the broken coffee table. Then a few days later he promised to send the replacement part for my curio cabinet by UPS. A week after that with no delivery, I called again and he promised it was being sent out and I would get a tracking number. Still no delivery and no tracking number. Bottom line: if you don't get your furniture the first time, you are out of luck. He said now that they're nationwide they're "very busy" and just can't keep up.

DO NOT SHOP HERE UNLESS YOU ARE LOCAL OR IN CA!<//Text>

<Review>I order my bed in August.  It is now October and I still received nothing.  After 3 failed attempts by muudu to delivery my bed, I cancelled my order. I was told a refund takes 3-14 days. It's been over 14 days with no refund. I called muudu and was told  i have to wait another week. Muudu takes your money, does not give you what you ordered, and does not refund you your money. Horrible service.<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>{'time': 1507758551471, 'text': "Jesica, I'm sorry to hear your service wasn't all it could have been.

I would give zero stars if I could. Shipping was delayed without notice. Customer service was unresponsive and terrible. When notice was eventually given it did not contain specific updates to timelines. They did not acknowledge my request for a refund after over a month of failing to ship the product I purchased. Do not buy from this company they don't respect their customers or their legal obligations.</review>

If I could have given zero stars I would have. Ordered an Item on 06/19 advised that delivery would be 3-14  days. 30 days later still no delivery. Several emails said your order is ready to be shipped. Received an email today that states your item is out of stock. This is truly unacceptable and horrible business practice. If you call their customer service no one ever answers  however you can leave a message. The only way you MAY get someone is if you act like you want to place an order.</Text>

I placed an order a couple of weeks ago.  I called and emailed several time to see what the status of the ordered was, but I either get an answering machine or someone states they will call me back.
One time, someone called me back at 7:30 pm and ask what the order number was. I said hold on so I can look it up, after 5 seconds, he hung up. People on the phone at this company have been very rude.< /Text>

I have placed an order a month ago.  They said order will be ready August 7th.  Its August 11th and no word on my order.  I called at least 7 times and they put me on hold an hang up on me, or they say they will call me back and they never do.  I will not order from them again in the future.<//Review>

< review>
To start, I recently moved and trashed our previous couches. So I ordered a sectional, bunk bed, and mattress on a monday. Nobody called me tuesday about delivery, I had to call Wednesday to find out. The lady tells me my order will be delivered hopefully by the end of the week. She called me tonight (Thursday) at 7 pm to tell me theyre delivering my items tomorrow, but they dont have my sectional because they cant find it. I was not happy about this, so I asked what my options were. Either find something else myself in 30 minutes, or get a refund that takes 3 to 5 dusiness days to process. She then tells me she will look for my sectional a little longer and call me back. When she calls back, she says your bunk bed will be delivered and I processed your refund but ill continue looking for the sectional. I asked why she would continue to look if she already started my refund. She said so I can place another order if they find it. Really? She honestly believed I would be willing to place another order with them after they botched my first one, then made me wait another week for my money back? Wow. If i ordered again when my money was refunded i would be waiting another week. So thanks to them I will be at least 2 weeks without couches.  If i was dumb enough to order with them again i would be aylt least 3 weeks without couches because delivery apparently takes forever. Dont waste your time with this place. Half the items are sold out that they have listed on the website, and customer service is far from a priority.< /review>

<text>Ordered in mid June, my card was charged the next day, heard nothing. I called after about three weeks and was told there was a note on my order saying they had a problem processing my payment? I called back, and they magically noticed they had processed my payment weeks ago. Another three or four weeks goes by, still nothing, I call again. I get an email saying they're having problems with their distribution center. Filed for a refund,  and called about every other day for a week before they finally processed it, and another four or five days after that until I saw the money back in my account. I would steer clear.<//text>< user_name>

Waited 2 weeks for furniture I ordered. Then waited and took off work an entire day for delivery they did not show up. They came the next morning at 630 am to tell me they don't know what happened but my items are not on the truck. I lost a days pay and am still waiting for my furniture. That I ordered on 4/24.<//review>

I purchased two recliners from Muuduu furniture. The price was right, but I had massive delivery problems and their customer service was horrendous!!!!!!!  Finally I lost it and filed a complaint with the BBB and posted several negative reviews on websites . I was contacted by John within hours of posting the reviews to solves this issue. If they are giving you a hard time post a bad review.....they will get you your furniture!<//text>

I placed an order over a month ago and I have not received it. I've emailed the company multiple times and have only received two responses telling me there is a delay. I also asked for a refund multiple times and was told that it would be processed. It's been two weeks since I was told I would receive my refund and it has not come through. I've also called customer service multiple times only to get a voicemail. I've left multiple voicemails which have been ignored. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THIS COMPANY. It is a scam.<//Text>

They charged my card, cancelled my order and never called to tell me that my order was cancelled.  If they can't ship out of state then that is a pretty easy fix when somebody is placing an order online for out of state.  I finally called them and am now trying to get my money back.  It is against the credit card company policy to charge a card before the product has shipped but that did not stop them.< /text>

I purchased less than 10 items almost 2 months ago,  they told me everything was in stock when I order, but when they deliver my order always missing something. Their excuse was the item is out of stock and kept me waiting. Less than 10 items, they took at least 4 times or more to deliver and till this day I am still missing something from the order. Also, the time frame they give me were never on time.</review>

We have been ordering from this location for 20+ years.
Everything we have ever ordered has been just wonderful.
We started ordering a supreme pizza with extra sausage and beef, and now trying extra mushrooms on half. I’m sure it will be just mouthwatering delicious 😋
Cant go wrong ethos place.
I would give them 10 ⭐️ Stars if I could.< /Review>

<Review>I ordered a pepperoni pizza 16in. It was okay not the best. Definitely affordable place to order from and size is decent. I think maybe a little more sauce and salt. Other than that it was just okay.<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've seen this little place on Federal Blvd for years and finally stopped by. Delicious pizza! Great deal on a large 3 topping. Saw another Bambinos up on Paradise Valley Rd too. And they have more than just pizza. Gyros, deli sandwiches, salads. Definitely worth checking them out. I was totally satisfied.<//Review>< pictures>

I won't be returning. I'm very particular about my pizza and I wasn't that pleased with this one. Sorry. Hate to give a bad review but just being honest. Always room for improvement and they definitely need to improve. The packaging and everything was good the pizza was something I wouldn't try again<//Text>

The salad was good too. Nice fresh crispy lettuce and veggies. The house sauce is pretty decent too. I was also able to switch sodas for the ones they didn't have so that was cool too.

Pizza is awful. Greasy and doughy made with noticeably cheap ingredients. I should have known better when saw they spelled pizzeria wrong. The fact that they have 3 locations makes me further lose hope in humanity. Honestly feel bad even giving the 90% uneaten pizza to my dogs. The girl at the front is nice and works hard but otherwise this place is pure trash.< /Review>

Great food and service at this place. They seem very busy non stop orders going out and people pulling up and leaving and the people wiring there didn't even sweat it. They were practicing Covid  guidelines asking people after they order to please wait out side. They just seem like they got it together over there. Aaa nd the food Forget about it.Bing Bang Boom Bambino's Pizza Joint 5 stars for sure.<//Text>

Our new favorite place to get a pizza! The pizza is fantastic. I have ordered family pizzas and huge party pizzas for fifty people. Their "contactless delivery" is so fast that my dog didn't even know the driver had come to the door!< /Text>

<pics>None<//pics><text>Honestly my wife and I were excited to try out this place after reading all the good reviews. I wish I could have also left a good review. I'm a big fan of the Philly cheese steak. I've had it from different restaurants. When I got home and was ready to eat my sandwich I felt as if I took a bite of a table salt sandwich it was super salty and the calzone was also salty. So sad, I really wanted to keep coming here since I live close by.</text>< Resp>

I ordered cheese, sausage, chicken n onions. The pizza is light and airy the crust needs some dipping sauce. I should have ordered sauce on the side but its not an option online. I delivered through POSTMATES who are cheaper, but the driver did NOT have on a mask.< /text>

My husband and I have been coming here for 3 plus years and we have never had a pizza that is this greasy as well as falling off the crust like this one. I can only hope that it is an  ingredient issue (cheap ingredients) or the chef is new but this is not the product I have ever expected for this company.</Review>< pictures>

The best pizza in downtown San Diego. I was introduced this place by a friend and whenever I am in this area, we order the largest buffalo chicken pizza. This taste is on point. For a very small location, they have a few great selections.I recommend this location to everyone.< /review>

<review>Bambinos's deserves more exposure!

The pizza is beyond delicious, the crust is fluffy and fresh, you don't get skimped on the toppings, and every. single. time I order it consistently amazing.

The draw back is that I love their pizza so much, I don't want to have anything but the pizza! I've had the jalapeño poppers and they are fresh and tasty too but beyond that I haven't adventured out.

We usually have it delivered and the staff are super kind and friendly too!</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None< /response>< Gmap_id>

I placed my order over an hour ago and they just canceled. It is now so late we have limited options for dinner. I called to talk with them and they won't even answer the phone.<//Review>

<Review>I have ordered  from Bambino’s several times and its always Been really good. We had Pizza Hut last week (lemon grove) and it was eehhhh(not good) Dominos (la mesa) is better but these guys can make some pizza! They have a good menu and Highly recommend. You big box guys need to try and then make yours and do the pizza challenge.</Review>< time>

The dough has a dash of sweet but works so well with all their pizza. I've only ever had the pizza but I love it and can tell they care about their shop. Thanks for killing it guys, never stop.

Pizza is great. Buffalo chicken fries were not too salty not enough buffalo sauce and chicken sizes were too small. Food may vary I suppose. Will try something else and update review.</Review>

I have been coming here for three years. The pizza is incredible, and very affordable. The hot sandwiches (particularly the chicken parmesan) are both delicious, and manageable. The staff is always friendly. Just a solid spot.< /Text>

Tried just now, and was excited to use a coupon and get a good deal. I'm really bummed out.</Text>< pics>

<Review>SO thrilled that we finally have an amazing pizza place in the neighborhood! Not only is the pizza wonderful, the staff is incredibly friendly! Yousef and his co-workers always greet us with a smile and even if its a chaotic weekend night, we never feel rushed when trying to figure out what we want. So lets talk food: the pizza, SO GOOD and the prices can't be beat. They have some amazing carry-out specials and they don't skip on toppings! On our very first visit we got the Pesto Sauce Pizza and we were hooked after that. I was also excited to see they have a chicken cheese steak, which was also delicious!  Keep up the great work you guys! You have a customer for life!<//Review><response>None</response></record>

<Text>Honestly this place is such a disappointment. Before the pizza used to be very cheesy and nice. But now the new owners barley put anything on the pizza. Also the pizza price is ridiculous, YOU ARE BETTER OFF EATING AT LITTLE CAESARS PIZZA LOL.  This place is overpriced and the pizza is not what it used to be. Also the offer specials, but the specials aren't so special. Also their x-large pizzas look like a medium sized pizza. I would cuss if I could.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

The best tasting freshly baked pizza in town! They serve it piping hot right out of the oven. They are generous with the cheese so the pizza is cheesey, the crust is perfectly baked with just the right amount of sweetness and each slice has a lot of Pepperoni on it! Their French fries are the big and thick ridged ones they serve with a lot of seasoning! We arrived at 9:30pm and the place was newly cleaned. They raised their 12" inch one topping pizza by a dollar to $6.95 but in today's economy, it's still an excellent deal considering the quality of their Pizzas and welcoming family run type service!< /Text>

I had to order a huge amount of pizza for an office function.  I ordered from another place ahead of time and they screwed me over at the last minute.  Called this place and they had 8 of those massive pizzas ready in about 45 minutes.  And at a decent price. They saved the day!  And the pizza was damn good too.</Text>

If you tip, make sure to do so once they are at your door. If you tip beforehand online they tend to not deliver to your door but make you go to the street. Fries were really soggy and chicken was dry. Good pizza though and lasagnia was as well.</Review>

Owner Joe gave me a credit to fix it. When i called back two days later, a VERY rude employee named Sam hung up in my face when asking about my credit. I called back and he proceeded to tell me I hung up on him when i clearly heard his phone slam in my face. Very unprofessional and now will wait until the owner is around to tell him about the people representing his business. Won't be giving my business to them ANYMORE.< /Review>< Pictures>

<review>I was not aware of this location until just the other day. And I've passed thru this area frequently, guess cuz I've never really looked for a food spot along that road til that day! Anyways it's a lil more pricier than the one at PH but quality is still there. Also different family. I thought their $5 pizza would be the same as the one at PH, but it wasn't. At Ph it's a 14" 1 topping for $5 theirs is a 10" for $5. All in all I'd still go here again only bcuz the quality of their food.< /review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80d9514f21fdcb53:0xf851bd6350710803<//Gmap_id></record>

Really good food at a great price, not a BIG fan of the popular pizza chains like pizza hut ect. So I decided to try this place out for my pizza cravings. After my first order with them I never looked back this is my go to pizza for that late night munchies< /text>

<user_id>112263792380683975201<//user_id><response>None< /response><Review>Neighborhood pizzeria with good selection of food, value and customer service. I recommend CALLING your order in though because from past experience, they always seem to make mistakes when you use the online ordering apps like “Slice.” For example, TWICE now, I’ve ordered chicken Phillies and received steak Phillies. Also more than once, I’ve opted to add on fries for +$1 and have gotten stiffed on 2 out of the 3 entrees’ fries. They’re an old-school family operation, so just stick with the old-school and CALL your order in and you should be good to go!</Review></record></dataset><record>

<text>The pizza is a big improvement from the former pizza restaurant. The Calzone is alright its just has a little too much grease for me. As far as everything else on the menu I have no complaints, it’s pretty good and its all handmade!<//text>< pics>

Since the new shop opened up, we've tried their Pizzas, Antipasto Salads, and Calzones,   I used to have to drive 15 miles round trip for these, but with this new shop, it is literally less than 500 feet away.

I host a shindig every other weekend, and every single time we've ordered, everyone who ate was pretty satisfied.   They definitely know their trade.

Here's hoping they stay here indefinitely.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

You know they have to be good with competition across the street. This is one of three locations. Very large menu. Looking forward to trying a couple other items on the menu. The outside looked kind of so-so, but the inside was very clean and nice. Will be going back.<//Review>< pics>

I had a big craving for diner burger when I stopped in. This place is right across from a chain burger place that's really good, Farmer Boys, but I like to check out the Mom and Pop places too.

First impression: the parking lot is a little weird if you turn in the way I did off Dale street. The restaurant was clean but like with most older diner's not a lot has been done to address things like rips in the booth seats. I'm actually okay with that bit of charm as long as it's still clean. The employees were friendly and took my special order with ease(bacon burger add cheese no tomato)

The burger was just what I was craving, and was cooked perfectly. The fries were crispy and I asked for a side of thousand island and that was good too.

All in all it's a great place to stop in and I'm glad I tried it!<//review>

I guess it's the little things that make a place good, like when they listen to your order.
Had the 2 beef tacos for $3, they were really good too.</review>< user>

The cashier with blonde hair is honestly so rude doesn't welcome you doesn't say anything to you , even through the drive thru doesn't say hi and gave my little sister attitude when she asked if she had put ketchup in the bag bc she just gave us the food and didn't offer  any condiments . She needs to learn better customer service .. I come here alot and unfortunately she's always the one working there ..</Review>< Pictures>

I was served a Denver Omlette that had no cheese in it but they threw two slices of Ameican cheese (sandwich cheese) on top. It wasn't even melted by the time I got home so I don't know if it was real American cheese or not.  The Omlette was burned and I ended up throwing the entire thing away. My husband's pastrami burger was under cooked and the pastrami didn't appear done either. The bread was hard and the lettuce was wilted. Never again will I spend my money here. The new owners/management have made this establishment horrible. Don't waste your money!!!!!</review>< Pictures>

You are not allowed to make any substitutions or customize orders even if youre willing to pay extra.  Apparently their employees are allowed to tell you what to get. Bad service.</review>

Went for dinner.  Not crowded. Waitress came and took our order. We waited, we waited and we waited. Our waitress disappeared. We waited. She walked by and asked how we were doing.  We told her we are still waiting for dinner.  She said that her manager had her take care of the women's bathroom and then assigned her to a different. So I watched go into the kitchen area checking all the order slips. No order slip for us. The manager came out and gave a lame excuse but would take care everything. So, we waited some more. Ordered the hummus appetizer without flatbread and extra veggies. When he finally brought it out there was the normal amount of veggies. No extra. Tole him that we no longer wanted the hummus. Please take it away, DO NOT charge us for it and please get out dinner.  We waited, yet again, and finally our order came. My order was wrong but by that time I just wanted supper. He said that he would take care of the bill. Our original waitress brought us a bill. At first, I thought it was just to sign. NO, he discounted the check but still charged us. The food is good but the portions have been getting smaller over time and now overpriced. Other people have had similar issues over the last few months. We will NOT be going back. Not that they really give a crap!!!!< /Text>

<Text>My family and I came here for Father's Day dinner around 6pm and were seated immediately. Our server Greg was funny and engaging. I ordered their Classic Cheeseburger (hey, I'm a simple girl all right?) which was well done, but the patty was somewhat dry. Their fries are excellent however! The Angel Hair Pasta was also somewhat dry and nearly devoid of sauce. By far, their best dish was the Moroccan Chicken -- perfectly tender and very well-seasoned.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Great atmosphere and attentive waitstaff.

The only reason for less than 5-stars is the lackluster calamari dish that was "warm" and not hot upon delivery to the table.
Other than that, a fairly nice place to enjoy an after work cocktail either indoors or on the patio where misters are functional.<//text>< Pictures>

Waitress didn't check in to advise delay. The hamburgers were RAW.  Bloody, uncooked raw, even the child's burger.  My friend ordered pork chop and steamed spinach.  She got mashed potatoes.  Left without eating.  They offered to make a salad to go but I didn't have another 50 minutes to wait.  The bread and butter were great, however.  It was almost laughable it was so bad.   Not even deserving of one star.<//Text>< Pictures>

No bueno!!  Food was bland and expensive.  Service was slow and unprofessional.  They tried to blame it on too many diners (on a Friday).  The manager straight up lied to my face.  He said he would take 20% off the meal.  He did not and would not.  I consider that the same as stealing. Will NEVER go back and I recommend you not to waste your time or dollar.< /text>

<Rating>4</Rating><text>I like coming her with my wife and friends.  The food is very good, the Bartender is great!  Clam chowder is served daily and the patio is a fabulous place to just hang out.

So, the next time you want to get away hit the bar, ask for the Bulleit Bourbon Old Fashioned no.3 and a Jalapeño cucumber Mojito to get started, order a second one for me while you're there and remember to have a good time.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

Nice service . We booked with budget and reached about 1 am .. we couldn’t find any representative in ground floor .. we waited for 10 mins and then went to 3rd floor for budget. Wish we knew it before.. also.. there is no shuttle service .. it’s an AirTran going from terminals to the rental station.. we didn’t know that too.. attaching a photo which shows the air train stops.. Hope it’s useful for others... good service overall.. hassle free returns ..</text>

<Review>As always National is the best. Did everything to accommodate me. They really take good care of their Executive elite members. I am satisfied every single week and today, once again, they went above my expectations. There’s absolutely no reason to go with any other company!</Review></record></dataset><record>

Long wait to pick up the car. In an attempt to upsell us to a full sized car, the agent flat out lied about the lack of space in a compact car for 4 adults with carry on suitcases. We had adequate room in the rear seats,  and could easily fit 6 carry ons in the trunk of the compact car.  Shame on you Thrifty!<//Text>

<text>Set up for COVID is very safe. The staff not overly friendly to a lot of us. They seem more inconvenienced by us than helpful. My hope is it was just the fear of COVID. The check-in process was simple but when you try to find your car pay attention to the hidden signage we got lost a couple of times trying to find the garage. check out was super convenient and simple when we returned the guy was very nice and helpful. The cashiers should take note from him and his customer service skills.< /text>< rating>

< Review>
KSFO is pretty big AIRPORT, car rentals could be confusing.
Is basically divided in 2 sections.

Section 1 - Car rental BLDG.
It's 4 floor with multiple agencies in every floor there you will pick up your vehicle. And also drop it off.
To get there from any terminal you have to take the air train. (BLUE LINE)

Section 2 - [Kiss and Fly]
OFF-SITE Facility, on the ground floor you go to ISLAND 2 and shuttle vehicles will drop you off at the car rentals.

I have been a regular renter from this location. Tried almost every brand such as Dollar, Enterprise, Alamo. Very convenient due to Air Train to/from BART.  Some of the companies do not have their counters there but they operate shuttle to and from here to their offices such as NU, Payless etc. Easy drop off. Rates are also very economical compared to other locations such as San Jose Airport, Oakland Airport and locations within cities.< /text>

Best thing about this car rental is the connection with airport. This car rental is connected through rail which arrives every 15 minutes and it will stop by all the terminals.< /Review>

Been here couple times for rental car whenever my husband & I want to rent a car for South Cal or long drive for vacation. Line moves fast & great car slection. The earliest you get your car better selection but the waiting time to get your car at a counter is longer as less staff works at early morning.<//Review>

Very easy to figure out how to use the tram from terminals to the rental cars. If you are at a terminal and need to rent a car, make sure you jump on the blue line. The red line only loops to the terminals in the opposite direction. The signs are clearly marked if you have questions. You will need to go up 3 floors from baggage claim to get to the trams. Signs clearly marked to help guide you.< /Review>

Thrifty/Dollar car rental charged me $450 for extra insurance coverage that I never asked for nor did they ask if I wanted the insurance to begin with. I already had the $5 a day insurance which is more than enough especially considering I have my own car insurance anyway. So why would I or anyone for that matter, ask for or give permission to receive a $450 supplemental insurance when that person (me) has full coverage in the 1st place.

This review was started and initially posted in September 2019. Still no response.
My advice? Use Enterprise. They are pretty awesome and I rent more than average.
PS(to dollar/thrifty): I hope the $450 was worth my never doing business with you again.</review>

Easy to get to from airport by train even though it is pretty far out. Pickup is smooth for Avis Preferred members with helpful staff and convenient setup in the garage. No gas stations close by so gas up early or pay for full up at the rental agency. Return entrances not easy to find for specific agencies as airport passenger remote drop off/pick-up are in the same place.< /text>

Rented a car at San Francisco, California airport very pleased with the rental.

San Francisco Airport needs to do something about the long walks with your luggage to the rental cars.

They need some type of riding little carts to take you to the trolley car that takes you to the rental cars. The walk is so long and hard when you're pulling luggage. Very disappointed that an airport that big does not have someone to drive you in those riding carts.

Very difficult for individuals that are having problems walking later in the evenings. The airport is still busy but no help. Get some ideas from the Phoenix Airport they're wonderful. They accommodate visitors needs San Francisco Airport doesn't.<//review>

<review>Car drop off is nice and fast (with National, at least), but getting from the rental car center to the terminals takes a solid 15 minutes spread across multiple elevator/escalator trips and a slowly trudging train, all connected by a series of rather poor signage.

Fox Rental car apparently has no qualms about being completely misleading, and lying about insurance options. Christina had no regret that she conned me into unnecessary, additional, duplicative insurance coverage. She must have sociopathic leanings to not feel bad about what she does.</Review>

<Text>We had the worst experience with Budget car rental. When we made reservations we couldn't do the express rental where you just get the car and drive away. After a 6 hour flight we went to get the car and waited over an hour in a LONG line. The employees were slow and only a couple registers were open. They send us to the parking garage to get the car and it's gone! They gave it to somebody else. We flagged down an employee in the garage he didn't seem to want to help. He just said go back inside and wait in line again. No way are we waiting again in that line! Thanks for helping jerk. I wish I got his name. So then we ask a lady and she had no clue. Luckily another nice employee saw what was going on and he got us another car. We saw others upset their cars were gone too. They over sold and were trying to find cars. Next time I will pay more and go with another company. The other lines had a lot of cashiers and small line.<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

It seems like the thing now. The airports I have been too have put all the car rental companies in their own building not to far away.

This one, at least you can get on the air tram and get there.< /review>

Had a long wait to get the car upon arrival. Once I got to the counter it was  fairly quick. Be aware if you pre purchase fuel it's a full tank, not what you use. My last trip I bought a full tank of gas and only went about 20 miles in an expedition. I should have paid better attention.< /text>

Getting a car reservation is pretty painless but getting checked out and back to the airport terminals can be downright aggravating!  Give yourself a bunch of extra time when bringing the car back!  The overall layout is poor since you're always forced to use too few elevators crammed in un-obvious places.  I've witnessed worse - but also a LOT better.< /Text>

One of the worst-designed rental car centres in the US. 4 stops on the air train to get there. 7 stops (7!) to get back to terminal 3. Up and down to get to the air train platform. A maze of roads to get to the car drop off. A tiny lane for all rental cars to exit the garage, right where all pedestrians need to cross to get to their cars!<//Review>

The counter is a free tram ride from the airport and all the major rental facilities are together.  Helpful staff when I was there, open late and early.  Easy access to surface roads and highway.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None<//resp><gmap_id>0x808f782b39179d4d:0xa61f40cd56eee39e</gmap_id></record>

We came in at 1:30 AM, and waited 30 minutes for service at Thrifty/Dollar. The women on duty were not overly pleasant either. Return was much better, as it was 9AM.< /text>

It is so much bigger now. They did not have the shuttle train when I last used it. Luckily my wife had used it a few times recently for business trips, so it made the experience of getting to the rental cars and to the airport pain free. We have used a couple different services now, and some are certainly better than others, in regard to the upkeep of the vehicles.< /Text></record>

Gas up before you get there. Watch the signs carefully,multiple rental agencies on different levels of the parking complex. Otherwise very efficient and courteous staff.<//Text>

I recently rented a car from them.  I realized I forgot my rain jacket in the back seat.  I tried to call them shortly after I returned the car and nobody picked up the phone. Tried again two days later, a Sunday, and they said they had no jacket. Directed me to a website.  Don't leave anything here. The employees steal.< /review>

The worst experience I’ve ever had. Agents at this location don’t even have the minimum knowledge to perform their jobs. Everybody from the new hires till the managers are absolutely shambles. Oh, I have to point out the manager, claimed she had 10 years of experience and that made me even more upset coz without even looking at my reservation she thought I booked an economy car even though I reserved a premium elite car( Jaguar XF or Mercedes C 300). She even had the nerve to tell me that Hertz has the right to assign any which they deem as premium Elite. In other words, even if you book a Mercedes they can assign you a Toyota Corolla. I would strongly suggest you all to avoid this location, they don’t care even if you are a President circle member. Further, I reached out to their customer services through Email but none of them responded. All they care about is your money, their standard are completely low in terms of customer service. I still don’t understand how these people end up working at Hertz. Sign up for enterprise or other rental agencies who will hold you to a higher standard. Please don’t be under the impression that hertz will treat you as a special one if you rent week in week out. In their eyes you are absolutely nothing.< /text>

<Text>Returning your rental car is easy enough. Getting to the airtrain? Crazy hard. Basically wait 15 mins for the elevator to go down to the first floor from the 3rd floor. Then go all the way back up to the too to get in the airtrain. The airtrain then take a solid 20 minutes to deliver you to tour m terminal. This takes way too much time.<//Text>< Pics>

Lot of rental car options. Very confused layout for new comers. There need to be more sign boards mentioning about the place. Absolutely there will be no support staff to help except reception staff of rental agencies.</Text>

<review>The rental car center at SFO is one of the best. The AirTrain get you there quickly.

if you have one of the fast Lanes for the rental cars you can just walk off the train get in your car and you can be on 101 in a matter of.

if you are going north or south on 101 don't follow Waze or Google maps but take the first light left. I don't know why they keep making you go to the second light it just seems longer.

About the only real downside is there is no gas. Plan accordingly.

if you can actually stay at a hotel nearby that has a shuttle save the night of parking cost and the night of your rental car and just return the car take the hotel shuttle to your hotel and then back the next morning.</review>< username>

<Review>Pick-up at Dollar was awful.  Agent was kind; not his fault.  Long wait in line as no cars per people's reservations??  Isn't that why we reserve?  Upgrades should be offered no charge.  We're paying more in gas and inconvenience.  Dollar's fault for not planning, despite knowing.<//Review>< user>

<Review>Getting to and from the rental car location at the SFO is a total slog.  You have to plan carefully if you have kids or lots of baggage because it is so far away from the airport proper.  Also, it is very confusing driving in and out of the rental area.  A definite thumbs down for this.
But I love Budget!  The Fastbreak works well here and as far as service goes - I was very pleased.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Make sure you read all the documents they give you to ensure you have everything you need for the journey.

They're very push about insurance but that because of the blame culture Americans live in so it's expected.<//Review>

<text>My rental car experience was horrible! The posted signs were confusing. The rental car area is off site that is accessible via shuttle bus or train. Expect to be confused with the signs. I recommend asking airport employees for direction. There is no gas station near the airport! I will not rent at SFO ever again!<//text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The worst! Stood in line for an hour at SFO, escalator broken, bad directions, not the car I ordered, no directions on where it was parked... on the roof!! Every other rental agency efficiently moved the customers to the cars, but budget was the only one with a line that didnt move. Watched agents go on break and come back, no sense of urgency at all.<//text>

<Review>After a 14 hr flight and 2 hrs queuing thru immigration!!!!the person on the collection desk could not have been less helpful. Once she realised that her pathetic attempts to upsell us were not going to work she rattled through the paperwork with little explanation. Just "sign here,here and here." When I asked for a fuller explanation of the tolls and charges she huffed and puffed but still didn't explain properly. We eventually got the keys and vague directions as to where to collect it. After a very long walk to as far away in the parking structure as it could be (payback for not upgrading and asking to many questions I wonder 🤔) we found our vehicle. From the outside it looked well used and dirty but when we looked inside it was full of broken glass and had what looked like blood splatters on the inside door trim! After walking back to the hire desk and explaining the condition and that we wanted to reject the vehicle the (same) woman could not have been less fazed as if it were a common occurrence to find a blood spatter in one of there returned and allegedly cleaned cars?!?! Her explanation was it must of "hit a deer or something"??!!  Even though the blood was on the inside and there was no excessive damage or blood on the unclean outside?? Miss Marple she was not. We did then receive a suitable car but again not clean and, as we found out later, with broken glass in the spare tyre well but I'd lost the will to go back again so departed. Needless to say we will not be using this service again and would advise any readers of this review to uber into the city and hire from there.< /Review>< Pics>

Alamo car rental
Location was easy to get there by airport train. We rented a car from Alamo. In and out was fine but we never get the car we want. Not just here but every locations. Car was new and pretty clean this time. No close gas stations around this area so be prepared.</Text>

<Review>Airport rental car centers at airports always seem to be far, far away from everything, but SFO seems especially egriegious. At SFO, it's the last stop on the tram that interconnects terminals. After a long flight, that tram can be a challenge to locate and get to on a good day, so... Tip #1: Build a ton of time into your schedule. Upwards of 30 minutes is not unreasonable.

You'll probably have to go to another level to get to your car. The tram stops at Floor 4; Hertz car pickup is on Level 1. You've got luggage, the elevators are slow and crowded, and the escalators go out of service randomly. Tip #2: Pack light and wear comfortable shoes, because you're probably using the stairs.

Once you're down there getting your car, cellular reception can be bad (carrier depending). You will not have a good place to pull over to set your destination in Google Maps after you drive out of the Garage. Tip #3: Set Google Maps coordinates for your destination before you get off the tram.

I'm not a fan of the SFO rental car center, but I fly here a lot, so I've learned to compensate. Woe betide those who are renting from one of the off-campus rental car companies!< /Review><rate>2< /rate><userid>104349398906807523399</userid>< Name>

Fun but long train ride to rental car center. Plan extra time accordingly. Upon return, don't follow signs to main airport, follow signs to rental car center in other direction - go slow and watch signage carefully. If you have a larger rental, be extra careful as it's a tight garage and confused pedestrians can suddenly walk in front of you.< /text>

It's weird to write a 5 star review of a rental car center, but they do get it right. So long as the air train is working this place is easy to get to, clearly signposted, well lit and has a place to get coffee even (it's probably awful coffee, didn't check) so it does all the things.< /text>

<Review>SFO has its car rental pickup and drop offs in a entirely separate building even for on airport car rental. The free airport shuttle called Airtrain has the stop well sign posted within the terminals. However do keep 15 mins aside for this extra distance. TOP TIP - from the highway (US 101) DO NOT FOLLOW Signs to the AIRPORT ARRIVAL OR DEARTURES. Instead carefully read instructions given by the car rental agency which is to follow signs to San Bruno. There are signs to car rental returns from the highway but not as prominent as for the airport terminals and once you go to the airport terminal there is no internal connection to the car rental building.

<text>Avis preferred is great. Skip the line and go straight to your car. If you do have to see a sales rep you will be waiting in line. Return car is quick and easy. Taking rail to the rental car terminal from SFO is only a few minutes away.<//text>< name>

< Review>
Ughhhhhhhh I'm literally cringing just thinking about our experience here. First of all you have to take a tram to get to the rental car place. The tram is not air conditioned, and was quite packed when we were on it, making for a very stinky ride. When we arrived, the signs said to go to level one if you had a reservation, which we did, so we proceeded to level one.

At the Hertz counter, you are then connected to a video chat customer service person. This person told me that I was a gold member and to proceed out to the car lot. We went out to the lot and went to the gold section, not knowing what else to do. After wandering around for about 15 minutes we found a lone worked who directed us to a service desk back at the beginning of where we were. At this point there were two people in front of us so we ended up waiting another fifteen minutes before getting to the desk.

And then the fun began. We had had some fraudulent charges to the credit card I used to book the reservation a few months ago so I no longer had that card. After spending another hour at this desk with the customer service agent making several phone calls back and forth, it was decided that we had to cancel the current reservation and create a new one. The problem now was that the rate I had was no longer available. In the end, I paid more than I should have for a lower tier car. The customer service agent I had was fine, and she tried to do the best she could, but it seems with all of the credit card fraud going on these days that this shouldn't have been the huge ordeal that it ended up being.

After all of that we got to our car and it was legit disgusting. It looked like someone had sneezed all over the windshield and there were fingerprint smears all over the side windows. I didn't want to argue with anyone anymore so I took my Clorox wipes and went to work.

Returning the car ended up being a whole other ordeal. We missed the exit for the rental car return so we ended up having to go all the way around the airport. However, there are legit no signs anywhere! The first turn off we encountered had a sign telling us to turn in and it was just a dead end road with no one anywhere. So we went around again and found another sign, behind a pole, telling us to turn in. Here we found the rental car return garage where you just leave the car with the keys in it and cross your fingers and hope for the best I guess? I'll update if I find any rogue charges regarding the car because leaving it with no one around just seems wierd and unsafe.

Bottom line - I will never choose to rent a car at this airport again. There are off-site rental companies that have shuttles going back and forth. If I have to rent a car again here, I would do the off-site companies instead.< /Review>

Not my favorite center, but serves the purpose.  The train ride is OK once you figure everything out.  The elevator ride back to the train is counter intuitive and creates a bottleneck in the traffic flow.  Better signage might help.<//Text>

Extensive facilities, but nothing beats the complete absence of frustration and unknowingness. Signs, symbols and satisfaction are the hallmarks of an effective, pulsating, functioning - airport - organism.
If I have to wonder about a basic feature for more than a few seconds, bring in new designers. Pilot-test with fresh minds, frequently. Listen to all the Airtrain audio, including altered service routes, looking for contradictions and ambiguities. They're there.
Thinking of San Mateo Exit and San Mateo Avenue: compare and contrast.</review>

< Review>
Hertz - horrible customer service counter.  It took 35 minutes to get our already reserved vehicle due to the rep trying to sell us everything but the kitchen sink.  We were also fined for crossing the golden gate and not paying the non-existent toll amount.  Apparently there is a sign on the bridge telling the website you must go to to pay the toll.  Hertz charged per day of rental as a fine, and never informed me before charging my card.< /Review>

The TSA line was very quick probably spent 20 minutes in line total. The confusing part was to get from the car rental to the airport through the air train.  But other than that smooth sailing and you can drink alcoholic beverages within the airport to calm the nerves before getting on a airplane.< /Text>

Such a busy place...takes some time to get to the center after collecting luggage and then waiting in line for 20-30 minutes to get the rental. Plan accordingly. Returning was a breeze. Again, allow time to get back to your terminal.< /text>

Easy to pick up a car and go. I've always used Alamo and haven't had a problem yet. I'd definitely suggest shopping around and making reservations in advance. The train shuttle drops you off right in front if coming in from the main airport.</Review>

Every time I arrive there (been there a few times a year for a few years now) there is an extremely slow line (longer than customs) and I have to wait an unacceptably long time for my rented vehicle.  Car return is quick.  They get two stars for actually having cars and for being accessible using the tram.</Text>

SFO has its car rental pickup and drop offs in a entirely separate building even for on airport car rental. The free airport shuttle called Airtrain has the stop well sign posted within the terminals. However do keep 15 mins aside for this extra distance. TOP TIP - from the highway (US 101) DO NOT FOLLOW Signs to the AIRPORT ARRIVAL OR DEARTURES. Instead carefully read instructions given by the car rental agency which is to follow signs to San Bruno. There are signs to car rental returns from the highway but not as prominent as for the airport terminals and once you go to the airport terminal there is no internal connection to the car rental building.

Of all the offsite car rental facilities this one is the easiest due to the rapid and frequent train that takes you directly to your terminal. SFO is a big airport, but this makes it easy.</Text>

First of all, it not straightforward to get to this place other than taking the AirTrain. Then arriving at the center you'll see counters on the first floor, but be careful that some companies have the actual counter on other floors. Confusing is my impression of this rental car center.< /review>

Do your research on here before you select a rental company. Some companies are in this centre which is a short-ish train ride from arrivals, and others are "off-terminal" which means you will need to go to the centre and then wait for a bus to pick you up to take you offsite somewhere to reach the company's rental centre. If you can afford it, definitely avoid this! Check which companies are in the car centre vs off-terminal before booking. Save yourself a nightmare!<//text>

<Pics>None<//Pics><review>Slow light-rail trundle from the terminal, seems to stop countless times for no reason. When you finally get there, you're on the wrong level for the frequent renter programs.

Similarly, after dropping off the car, you're on the wrong level to get the trundle back to the terminal. So give yourself plenty of time!

Hertz at this location tried to rip me off by changing the rate from what was booked to one that was THREE TIMES the price. Central customer-service staff response was shambolic, contradictory, unhelpful and deeply, deeply unimpressive.</review><username>Richi Jennings</username>< userid>

<review>I have rented cars from here many times. The first pain is to drag all your bags on the train and then take it to the rental car center. To avoid the crazy lines and waiting time, sign up for your rental companies frequent renter program... That lets you skip the line on the main level and lets you directly proceed to the level where your car is. From there you will see either your name on a board and just go straigt to your car or there is another counter, which is usually less crowded. If your name is on a board, take your car and drive to the exit, show the agent there your drivers licenese and you are good to go.
Returning here is a bit stupid too. No matter at what level you return your car, you have to take your bags to ground level and then back up to the train station level.</review>< name>

Finally, when I got to the counter, the Thrifty person was very welcoming and helpful. Overall it's been an okay experience. They tell me that mornings they are practically empty.< /text><Rating>3< /Rating>< resp>

Connected to the airport via a tram.  It's huge so if you're car is on a perimeter row enjoy the walk. Plan on 20 minutes to drop off and get to your terminal.<//Review>

This is simply because SFO is one of the biggest hubs in west coast, and nobody's fault, but I was already tired at the beginning of the trip.

So my lesson leaned here was it's always good to have relaxed schedule for arriving day.<//Review>< Rating>

The Car Rental Center is one of the worst I have experienced not worthy of an international airport like San Francisco.
Not only does it take too long to get there, once there, it is very inconvenient to find out where to go. You get there with the Airtran, an automated shuttle train, which runs every 4 minutes. It takes at least 5 minutes to get there, depending on where you board the Airtran, and once there, you step into the building with all the on-site car rental companies in front of you. However, there is a catch: the level where you arrive is only for frequent travelers, such as Hertz Gold members. All the other, occasional renters must go to the ground level and stand in line to get their rental car. Unfortunately, it seems that any counter of any rental car company seems notoriously understaffed since I never could get my car without of a minimum of 15 minutes wait.

This has to change!<//Text>

<review>It's a massive rental car center. If you like cars and/or have a tendency to drive them in SF (which is NOT recommended, seriously what are you thinking), you will probably end up here. It's not too bad, but lines can be long. Be warned, the monorail takes FOREVER to get to the terminal that you want (but, of course it does).

Tip: there is a costco gas station very close to here- highly recommend to fill up there (yes, you need a costco card to do so).<//review></record></dataset><record>

Less than 5 stars only because signage is tuff to use for navigation to where you're going. We ended up circling around a few times before figuring out how to drop off our rental car. Ahhhh, San Francisco...<//Text>

Make sure you sign up for the free Gold program, then you can just walk down to the cars, and on a board you'll see the stall your car is parked at. Drive off to the gate, show them your driver's license and they print the rental agreement, quick and easy. If you don't like the car you are getting, pick another one.</review>

Thrifty Rent a car
Reserved a car for 5 days with an estimated charge of $110.53.  Plans changed and had to return the car a day early and they charged me $586.53 for the car.  Pulled a rental rate out of thin air of $146 A DAY.  Looked on their website several times and the rate for the car I rented is NEVER more then $50.  They charged me 3 times as much as there maximum advertised rate.  Customer Service totally unresponsive.  NEVER AGAIN will I use this company and neither should you!< /text>

Less than 5 stars only because signage is tuff to use for navigation to where you're going. We ended up circling around a few times before figuring out how to drop off our rental car. Ahhhh, San Francisco...</review>

Had Emerald Executive privileges at National or the rating may not be 5 star because wait times at the counters here can get long. But if you have the perk, you breeze. The tram from the terminals worked well, the elevator for luggage was working right and also looked cleaner than in the past. and I got in and out in no time.<//text>

Long way from airport and very costly for train ride to rental car building. Also they make you go downstairs and then back up on return when that is not really needed.<//text>

Hertz here is terrible. If you like to be give a car filled with someone else's trash and dirt then this is the place to go. I won't go here again. My car was so gross and I reserved months in advance to wait in line with people that didn't have reservations for 30+ minutes. That's not cool.< /review>

The Hertz rental counter here is the worst.  They will try to give you a car other than the one you reserved, and then act like it is your fault when you return to the counter to tell them they screwed up.  The staff are juvenile, rude, and completely untrustworthy.</Text>

Seriously far from the airport and very poor signs to help you find the train. And, when bringing the car back and you need the train to the terminal, terrible signage for how to find the train entrance.</Review>

<text>F*X car rental is beyond the worst makes h**tz look like a first class company. The guy went crazy screaming yelling and chasing me around the car garage on foot. All because they tried to rent me a car with a cracked front bumper and sides and i was taken pictures of the damage before i was going to take it. I wish i could post you a video i took on here of this manager trying to get at me.< /text><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

Few immigration desks open to cope with passengers. Over an hour to queue to get through by which time baggage from the flight had been removed from the conveyor. Not a good welcome to the West Coast< /Text>

<review>The lines were so long. I spent an hour in line to rent a car, even though I had a reservation, then had to wait 15 minutes to receive keys to a car.  This has to be one of the worst airports I have ever used for a rental car.</review>< pictures>

Never, ever rent a car here unless you have the fancy plan where you can cut the line.  Otherwise take BART into the city and rent your car there.</Review>

< Review>
Again. Excellent. I recommend Hertz, Dollar, Alamo, and Thrifty. Be sure to go online first for best deals. Go without the GPS, and satellite radio they offer. You can access these using your smartphone! Look your rental over(prior to)driving off and be sure to take pictures too. Usually, where you’ll be picking up your rental, the venue lacks proper lighting so be aware.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) The car rental center at San Francisco Airport is a bit off the terminal. It can be reached by train from the San Francisco International Airport station. How long you have to wait depends on the selection of the landlord booked in advance.

(Original)
Das Mietwagencenter am Flughafen von San Francisco liegt etwas abseits vom Terminal. Man erreicht es mit der Bahn von der Station San Francisco International Airport aus. Es hängt von der Auswahl des im Vorfeld gebuchten Vermieters ab, wie lange man warten muss.<//Text>

(Translated by Google) Very organized! Fast, like a bit at all airports. With maps, you just have to enter the address and let yourself be guided

Car rental is difficult elsewhere.
Non-US foreigners will be charged at least $ 500 as a deposit.
In addition, insurance is more expensive than foreigners think.
Foreigners say that the cost of handling an accident is high.
Minimizing your insurance will allow you to rent less expensively.

샌프란시스코 국제공항에서 순환 트레인으로 10여분 걸리면 가실 수 있습니다. 모든 렌탈카 업체들이 이 곳에 모여 있습니다.
다른 곳엔 카 렌탈이 어렵다고 보셔도 됩니다.
미국이 아닌 외국인들한테는 보증금으로 500$ 이상이  부과됩니다.
또한 외국인한테는 보험이 생각보다 비싸게 적용됩니다.
외국인의 경우 사고시 처리 비용이 많다고 하네요.
보험을 최소로 하면 그리 비싸지 않게 렌탈하실 수 있습니다.<//review></record>

<review>(Translated by Google) Other airports should learn from it. But it seems to me that it has been completely redone. The train will soon be extended to another building which will certainly be a car park with direct access to all terminals.

(Translated by Google) All very straightforward expired. Booked in Germany online at Check24 the car. Staff is very friendly and explain the process a very good. Depending on the category you booked, there are several cars to choose from. You go to the area you booked and just take a car. When out driving the car is then scanned and the driving license checks. The return has expired without any problems. Again, the staff was very friendly. Always my pleasure. Have brought the cars in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Las Vegas at Alamo or given.

(Original)
Alles sehr unkompliziert abgelaufen. Hatten in Deutschland online bei Check24 das Auto gebucht. Personal ist sehr freundlich und erklären einen den Ablauf sehr gut. Je nach Kategorie die man gebucht hat, stehen verschiedene Autos zur Auswahl. Man geht zum Bereich den man gebucht hat und nimmt sich einfach ein Auto. Beim rausfahren wird dann das Auto gescannt und der Führerschein überprüft. Auch die Rückgabe ist vollkommen problemlos abgelaufen. Auch hier war das Personal sehr freundlich. Immer wieder gerne. Haben in Los Angeles, San Francisco und Las Vegas bei Alamo die Autos geholt bzw. abgegeben.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Bad experience with Dollar, which is the same house as Hertz and Thrifty

They charge extra fees of $ 25 per airport pick up.

They charge $ 20 if you pick it up before the set time, that or wait in front of the counter.

And the tolls better pay them online because they charge more expensive. For example if you take the Golden Gate.

And eye check ALL scratches no matter how small they are.

They try to take money everywhere.

(Original)
Mala experiencia con Dollar, que es la misma casa que Hertz Y Thrifty

Cobran tasas extra de 25$ por recogida en aeropuerto.

Cobran 20$ si lo recoges antes de la hora establecida, eso o esperar delante del mostrador.

Y los peajes mejor pagarlos online porque ellos lo cobran más caros. Por ejemplo si coges el del Golden Gate.

Y ojo marcar TODOS los arañazos por pequeños que sean.

Te intentan sacar dinero por todos lados.</Text>
