<Review>One of my guilty pleasures. Definitely a splurge, but the coffee is absolutely worth it. Never had a bad cup here. I always buy extra if I know I’m going away for a while .<//Review>< rating>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>Second time we've visited here (from SF). Had a cappuccino last time and a golden milk (i.e. turmeric) latte this time, just to fit in with the hipster kids. Both drinks were delicious, and service is on point. They do 6oz cappuccinos which is unusual, and very welcome in a world of oversized drinks. Really nice aesthetics, cute loft area. Definitely the place to go for coffee in Sebastopol.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO3TjC392jGmqx5gEebWYPfOt37llbtoVC7UH0e=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< Resp>

<text>The Farmhouse Decaf is great. Although, after two weeks of waiting for my online order there's still no coffee in site. No tracking and no phone number to ask questions, and no response to my email.
Email answered, mystery solved, and the items were sent overnight.

The best possible place to drink coffee in Sonoma county.
A very relaxed atmosphere, eclectic  music selection,  a downstairs/outside patio and an upstairs area with long tables to study or get extra work done with friends and colleagues.  This is a place to make new friends/network. Plus you can't go wrong with any of their drinks. But careful. The coffee is strong ;)< /Text>

<Review>Great coffee. Top notch. Brilliant service - actually some of the best service I've ever experienced. I'm not going to write out a long and descriptive explanatory monologue about what happened when I was there I'm just going to say I worked for a long time somewhere similar and this place is top notch with 9.5/10 quality 10/10 customer service 10/10 speed and convenience.

Thank you for the great experience!< /Review>< pics>

<review>My wife and I just love Taylor Maid and their organic coffee.   It can be difficult to find a good Cappuccino,  but they do it right.  The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting.  We also use there Organic Goat Rock Roast at home,  which is fantastic. I like to use a French press.<//review>< time>

This probably as good a place to find coffee as you're going to find in the North Bay. It's in the Barlow Center, just down the street from the Rialto Cinema and, beyond that, Whole Foods. There is parking but I'm noticing it is not as plentiful as it was, even not that long ago. WiFi is available and decent. It has baked goodies but few are vegan. Also, if you want a pour-over (my own preference), try to get your order in before 2 pm.<//text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>I came the other day and decided to come back because it was good, quality coffee. This time however, me being the completely clumsy person that I am, I dropped my coffee and busted it all over the sidewalk outside of the door. I actually wanted to die if embarrassment. Everyone clearly saw me because there was an on cue "ahhhh!" from everyone within earshot. So I go back in to buy a new one and a sweet couple that happened to saw my ever so graceful drop offered to buy me a new one. When the ladies working heard I dropped it, they piped in and said they had me covered. It was so sweet and heartwarming that I felt obligated to share. Thank you Taylor Maid Farms for hiring on such an amazing staff!<//review>< Name>

<Text>This is a great place to buy beans. Their coffee cans keep the beans fresh. I'm from Oregon but I come to Sebastapol regularly.  I always get or refill a can to take home.<//Text>< user_id>

One of the best places to get Coffee in Sonoma County.

Even though Taylor Maid Farms was recently purchased, this coffee bar brews some of the most consistently good coffee here in Sonoma County.

If you're interested in fine coffees brewed well, you can do a lot worse than here.</review>

<Review>I wish we (still) had lesbian bars like this, in Portland! 💋👩‍❤️‍👩🍸
Good drink specials,  delicious made to order food, a little on the spendy side for bar grub, but that might just be my lack of comfort with San Francisco pricing 🤣.  I loved the wall of pictures in the back room dance floor (wink) and the wallpaper is really delightful... you'll just have to visit to know what I'm talking about!
Relaxed, fun atmosphere.. even on an early Friday night it was still busy enough to feel anonymous if that's your thing, but enough room to move and dance. I'll definitely come back the next time I'm in town.<//Review><Rate>4</Rate>< gmap_id>

<Review>This was my first time being able to celebrate Pride (and in San Francisco no less!). Jolene’s was full of wonderful LGBT folks from all over the Bay Area the night after the parade- but we know the real Pride starts when we can all share the same intimate space. The music and atmosphere was static.

Jolene’s is a place where you can revel in the joy, the resilience, the protest, and the camaraderie that the San Francisco lgbt+ community has to offer.< /Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOi9UZFExZ8716ynJMLLgLhM4-oW9zMCET05NTO=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /Pictures>< resp>

Shereen and Shannan were absolutely amazing! Hands down best service thus far. Promptness with a smile is all you can ask for when you are getting bottomless mimosas! Will be back most definitely.</review>

<review>10$ dollar entrance fee regardless of what event is going on. Takes forever to get served at the bar. The drinks are expensive and come in really small plastic cups that are filled with ice. The dance floor has no ventilation and feels like you are in a sweat steam room. The music always leaves something to be desired. In addition, the vibe is always very strange and hostile. I have been several times and I regret ever spending any time or money there.<//review>< Pics>

Relaxed and welcoming atmosphere for any and all. Usually get some Mac and cheese balls and fries to go along with rotating, inventive cocktails. Awesome dance floor which is usually empty when I go on weekday evenings. Good for you and a partner, a solo work session, or a medium-sized group (plenty of season).<//text>

Not a safe place. Not inclusive. Was hoping for a good lgbt community and female power but was disappointed when I felt out of place, ignored when being served, and rude management. Would not go here again.< /review>

Staff clearly love their jobs. Brunch food is amazing and affordable compared to other city brunch spots. Cocktails are strong and tasty. A great place to support.</review>

Solid drinks and excellent ambiance/decor. The cocktails are good and they have fieldwork on tap (which I'll always be happy with).</Text>

<review>The vibe on a Friday night is fun.  Food is surprisingly yummy, but prices for food & drink tend on the higher end.  Go-go dancers, good DJ jams, good lighting, pool table, and a safe & fun atmosphere lead to good times.  I have not experienced brunch, but I have yet to have a negative experience here.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp><date>1573330463670</date><pics>None< /pics><rating>4<//rating><gmapID>0x808f7f6fd5060f41:0x67b2793bc5c17cf5< /gmapID>< user>

This new bar is so well thought out! They have water pitchers (so You don’t have to ask at the bar and can stay hydrated), plenty of seating in the spacious main room, gogo dancers, great bar food, pool tables, coat check and an intimate room for dancing within eyeshot of the DJ. Such a good club! Honestly, think it’s the best new gay bar in the city!< /Text>

<review>Jolene Linsangan is a notorious TERF and this bar by extension is a haven for TERF's! Do not patron! There are FAR better alternatives for the lesbian community.

Transgender women, especially ones of color, are NOT welcome, at best they are tolerated. Should they "step out line" by having the temerity to approach a CIS woman they are instantly expelled!< /review></record>

Sunday was my friends Birthday. She had called and messaged ahead of time to see how to reserve tables for all in her party. There was a planned 30 ppl from south bay suppose to show up to celebrate. She was told its 1st come 1st serve basis. So we showed up right when doors opened walked in and saw 3 tables with "reserved" signs on  them. We asked the bartender how we could get tables or even reserve them. We told her what we were told. Her reply is "I literally have no idea. That comes from the owner".  We thought that was weird but settled for bar sitting even though we knew it wasn't going to be enough space for us all. As time went on now 3hrs into the show  I wanted to try some of my friends mimosa. So I poured 2 oz in my 4 oz water cup. With quickness the male bartender jumped down my throat. Going off on me about how I didn't pay for the mimosa. And I told him no my friend did I just wanted to try it. He continued to tell me I couldn't bc I didn't pay for it. I said so is "sharing is not caring here" he said "No sharing is not caring here" he told me that I might as well drink it now being that I poured it. I told him nm he turned me off to it and I didn't want it anymore. From that point on I didn't order anything anymore.

Look ppl I get if it's their policy you can't share bottomless mimosas but don't talk ppl so rudely. Especially if you do not have that posted anywhere not even on your website! Seriously there are different ways to tell a customer what the bar policy is. In all none of us in the party were impressed or really happy about the service here. We will not be back. That's 22 ppl from SJ who will only be speaking about how bad their experience was here.</Text>

It's GREAT to have a womens bar again in SF...and Jolenes bar hits the mark perfectly. Staff is pretty laid back attentive to customers and even serve with a smile! It's so wonderful to see so many different types of women flocking to Jolenes    the want and need was there and Jolenes have made a chill safe CLEAN place for us to go,)<//Review>

Management and staff were most helpful in handling a job that was, pardon the pun, "a wash". They were intent on helping us solve our problem that could have cost us into the thousands to replace. Classy with excellent customer service! Looking forward to the next 50 years of business.</text>

As always, the folks at Flair do an excellent job with our dry cleaning and other items....I am always greeted in a way that you'd think I was their next door neighbor.  They understand what personal customer service is and give it with a smile in an effortless way.  They stand behind their work of course.  I wouldn't consider taking our business anywhere else----I'm a very satisfied and happy customer!<//text>

The coat had arrived from Banana Republic quite wrinkled and was unwearable until pressed. Service was great! The people at Flairs are friendly  and efficient, however, when I went back in to pick up my coat, I couldn't believe it! I was charged $21.00 to have a soft trench coat pressed. I think that is way too much money to pay for such a simple job! I assumed it would be around $8.00 to  $10.00 for a press. I love this dry cleaner because they do a great job, but I can't afford them.

I've worked in luxury fashion all my life and don't trust my clothes to just anyone!  Flair does a first-class job on every item including tailoring.  Their customer service is awesome, and pricing is great value for the service & care they provide.   Highly recommend.<//Review>

Lack of communication on their end for a coupon I had that was expiring at the end of month. Never was told to present them with them coupon at the time of visit and since I picked it up at the beginning  of the next month they wouldn’t honor it (though it was their fault).
One item was not even cleaned.
Very expensive.
Nice people and clean place but was over priced<//review>

I have been using Flair Cleaners, for all my custom dress shirts.  Henry, takes his time to understand your wants and needs then customizes his latest fabrics to make you look the part.  He always carries some of the most exclusive fabrics and is able to mix and match different colors of fabrics to give you a true customized shirt and look.<//review>

<rating>5<//rating><review>I took in a silk dress to be altered as the sleeves - heavily-embroidered, bell-shaped - were far too long for me.  I tried on the dress, the tailor put one safety pin in one sleeve, and a complicated tailoring job (the sleeves had to be taken up at the shoulder, otherwise the embroidery on the ends would be lost) was completed brilliantly and with minimum fuss.  Very reasonable price, too.  Very highly recommended.< /review>< Pictures>

Very professional staff, quick turnaround of clothes, open 7 days/week, clean/inviting facility and fair prices for the service and location IMO! I also like that they have a tailor/seamstress onsite if the need arises for customers.<//Review>

We're here from Massachusetts visiting our son. He was away for a while and had a lot of laundry to do including sheets and a bedspread. Instead of losing valuable time together found the wash we had Flair do it for us. They washed and folded and got it back to us in one day. That's the way to go</Text>

I haven’t yet picked up my dry cleaning or tailoring and cannot yet speak to quality, but be sure to ask about pricing when you go. There are no price lists posted in the store or online and my dry cleaning pickup receipt did not have a total on it. When I asked how much it would be the clerk told me I had to wait while she “entered it in.” While I waited another woman came in to drop off and said “how much will it be? You guys are really shady about pricing.” And was told to wait to find out, the same as me. Whatever system is currently in use is not transparent to the customer, I’ve never experienced this at any other dry cleaner.

The price for dry cleaning was not exorbitant, however my pants thats are having alterations done are shockingly expensive. It’s $70 WITH a 15% discount to have 2 pants taken in and 1 of those also hemmed. The hemming alone is $20, something that should be $5. I hope they’re perfect, I’ve never paid so much for alterations that weren’t actually having something completely remade. Regardless, I’ll find someplace else for tailoring in future.<//Text>

<Text>nice work but their ethics are weird.  They need to know IN ADVANCE if you want to use a coupon.... So they can raise the price just to give you the coupon's discount.  No fair.</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

avoid like the plague.  They ruined two pairs of my pants.  When I went back and asked for them to be patched (not paid for, simply patched) the woman in charge of the place was unbelievably rude and condescending.  All the while she was standing under a sign saying "It's on time, it's right or it's free" or some other such mush.  There are many nearby dry cleaners....you can do better.<//Review>

Absolutely do not go here. They aren't good at treating stains and we have had so many issues over the last few years.  We just took our sofa cover here for DRY CLEANING and they washed and shrunk it! It now no longer fits the sofa and they have been extremely painful to work with to get it fixed. It was a $500 sofa cover... that's no longer for sale. We will no longer be using their services and switching to Door to Door cleaners up the street which do a FANTASTIC JOB!</text>

<review>When I went to pick up laundered shirts, the price was three times what they said it would be and they had excuses for why. Don't trust what they tell you when you drop off.<//review>< Pictures>

<response>{'time': 1448066014304, 'text': 'I apologize if you were quoted incorrect prices for your shirts. We try to always be fair and consistent with our pricing. We do charge more for some laundered shirts because they take additional time to press. I would appreciate it if you stopped in and discussed the situation with one of our managers so that we can resolve this issue. Sorry again for the inconvenience.'}</response>< gmapID>

He’s factual, interesting & his presentation is direct & relates to today. (I’m able to retain the message applying it to my week! which is huge for me.. 😉lol)
It doesn’t hurt that the church is in one of the Valley’s highest areas where one can sit & read or chat at any of several tables & chairs set up in front of the chapel & take in the breathtaking views of the entire Valley & more.

The more you go, the more you love it. The kids ministry is amazing. Even praying for the young babies. The older children have engaging experiences. The main service challenges and encourages me every week. The small group / life groups that meet during the week are amazing and create such a great community. Absolutely love this church and the people.<//text>

This church is beyond organized. But on top of that, they are clearly in the business of loving God and sharing that love with others.

My husband and I started attending last November with our twin boys. Right from the beginning, we loved what was going on in the kids' ministry. We LOVED the Celebrate Recovery ministry (and we are now involved in it!) We loved that the worship is not about putting on a "show". It is a deep, meaningful outpour of collective praise to God. It's real stuff. You can feel the presence of God. Then the pastor. Lord have mercy. The messages are so on point - not too long, but long enough that I feel I was just fed a great spiritual meal. Topics that are super relevant, and things I need to be ministered to about. So there's an intro that's like a story. Then there's meat and potatoes - solid biblical verses, historical input, and contextual insight so we UNDERSTAND what's happening and what God is doing in that moment in the Bible. Then, the close - HOW THIS RELATES TO ME and what I should do about it from GOD's words, not anyone else's. I honestly am so grateful that we came to Rocky Peak. There are places you just go to. And then, there are places that God leads you to. There is a difference. Go check it out.</Review>

The sermon was incredibly engaging! I had my eyes glued on the pastor the entire time. I did not get to experience all of worship but the pat I did catch it was awesome.

I visited on a recommendation and I am so glad I did. So I am on here passing on mine.

I will definitely make a point of attending here again!</Review>

We found this church when we were on a temporary work assignment in the area and were able to attend about six weeks worth of services. Very friendly congregation and relateable pastors, we felt right at home. We loved it so much we have come home and are streaming the services to CO! We definitely recommend. And the setting is beautiful!< /review>

<review>the church at rocky peak is wonderful.  pastor mike is such a great pastor.  the church welcomes you and is so relaxed.  we lived in woodland hills ca and moved in 2010 to Virginia.  we miss rock peak and search for a church like it.<//review>< Pictures>

We've been going to Rocky Peak Church now for over a month and in this short period of time, we have absolutely fallen in love with this church.  From the teaching, to the worship, to the community of people who are loving and non judgmental, to the donuts and coffee out front (which by the way, you can bring inside), we love it!  We are growing here and will be raising our family at Rocky Peak!

It's also worth mentioning that my wife and I have been to many other churches in the SFV over the years (consistantly) and even came to Rocky Peak once in the past (I think we were looking for something smaller at the time), but we now have found what we were looking for here at Rocky Peak!  God knew what we needed at the right time (It was worth not giving up!).</Text>

<name>Michael Johnston< /name><Time>1372125167430< /Time><Review>This Church is filled with Followers not Fans. Pastor Mike and the rest of the pastoral staff are great mentor's and teachers of the one true God. If you are looking for a Bible believing church full of love and grace then come join us Saturdays at 530 or Sundays at 9 or 11.<//Review></record>

I'm new to the area. Didn't even have a vet yet.
My pup had was injured on Easter. The emergency locations weren't able to help because they were all full and my pup wasn't critical.   The team squeezed my pup in.  Assessed, cleaned his wound and they were able to take wonderful care of him. Great team. Thank you!!< /Text>

Every time I take my puppy the ladies are amazing. Even though Cici may beg me not to leave her and hesitant when we arrive,  I know they're reassuring, comforting, and good people because when I pick her up she isn't agitated or rushing to jump in my arms.< /review>

<Text>The staff was very informative and answered all our questions. They were extremely helpful. They also handled our pet kitty with great care. You can just tell they have an enormous compassion and love and patience for all fury friends. We knew our Sidney was in good hands. Even when she wasn't as cooperative with the vet, they did everything they could to make her comfortable and suggested what I can do at home to provide comfort. Our baby is a rescue and she is losing a lot of hair. I'm sure it's due to stress because of the new environment. The staff there was very helpful.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< gmapID>

<review>I have been a Banfield wellness plan customer for 8 years, and recently moved to the area. I took my dog in for a semi-emergency for a wound cleaning and evaluation. After we arrived and checked in for our drop off appointment, we waited over 10 minutes before anyone came out to take my dog to the back, watching others who checked in after us get taken back, before the person who checked us in finally just took my dog back. This happened again when I went to pick up my dog - I paid and then waited, and waited, before the person who checked me out went and got my dog. I understand that they are busy, but this seemed to be an indicator that they easily miss things and set the visit off on the wrong foot.
In addition, the doctor who called was not very responsive to the symptoms and description of the issue and seemed to push an agenda in terms of what they thought was wrong. They charged me for a wound cleaning, bandage, and sent us home with antibiotics and said to come back in 10 days. No one called to follow up on us, which is normal practice for Banfield hospitals that we've visited in the past.
All of this added up to an uneasy feeling for me, so I ended up getting a second opinion at another local vet, who diagnosed my dog with a semi-rare infection that requires a lot more care than we ever would've gotten from Banfield.
As a result of this experience, I have cancelled my wellness plan and moved my dog's care to the other vet - and I won't recommend the Banfield plans to anyone anymore. The level of care that my dog has received at the other  vet in just the past two weeks has FAR exceeded any care I received from any Banfield hospital in the past 8 years.</review><Pics>None</Pics><Response>None< /Response>< GmapID>

Basically paid over $1,000 for them to not even identify what was wrong with my cat and she ended up passing away. Then they failed to call me when her remains became available for pick up. Highly disappointed from start to end.<//review>

<Text>Normaly we always have a great experience  at the banfield in petsmart. Murrieta location.This last appt was scheduled for July 3rd and when we showed up no one was at the front desk and the lights in the rooms were off so I waited about 5 minutes before I ask the check out lady from petsmart  to find out they were closed for the week. No one called us to reschedule. I was not happy and now my dogs immunizations are past due and I can't board him or go on vacation until I can get a new appt<//Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1594052214013, 'text': 'Hello Christi, we are so sorry to hear about this and would like to discuss this with you further.

I found a coupon for a free visit online, called to make an appointment and was rudely told they could not honor it since there was no expiration date. I asked to speak to the office manager and was put on eternal hold. What a horrible way to handle perspective clients. I will never take my pets here and will tell friends and family to steer clear.< /Text>

I needed a closer veterinarian for my dogs since I moved. Husband and I visited Banfield today, medicine in hand and he approached the woman in the front, she immediately saw it was a prescription medication in his hand and told him to go back to his vet. I would not recommend this place as they obviously could care less about your business.</Text>

Very rude and avoidance. They would not give an estimate on what they have. The employees kept talking when I walked up then they were very rude.< /Review>

< Review>
Horrible doctor. All of them cover for each other. Lies after lies.. I need major surgery and will not let them. I was told that if I had an emergency. That I couldn't call them at night and go to the emergency hospital that I would have to wait till the office is open. What I have needs different stages of surgery and could get infected. He is rude and only wants to make money off me. My surgeries will make him rich. I will be going to the best doctors. Not even explained what procedure about each step of the surgery. Please people do your research. It's been scary to deal with him and the emergency hospital Glendale Adventist. I am still emotionally effective by the care of bad treatment. I have had nightmare and scare to see any doctors.<//Review>

Her care and listening ear made me feel really comfortable and confident that I was in the right hands for this emergency.  She explained everything and answered all my questions.

I saw Dr. Pak to evaluate a hernia. We discussed the pros and cons of treatment, and he recommended NOT doing surgery. Nice to see someone who doesn't want to chop you up just to make money.<//Review>

Mike the owner is awesome. He had just opened the business when I was in search of a barber. Have been going ever since... 7+ years. This is a man's barbershop. Fishing and ocean decor throughout. All of the barbers are pretty good. Need a fishing tip, ask Mike. 😁< /Review>

I've been taking my boys here for years. Mike does a great job. Plus my hubby loves that Mike will do a hot shave. Great service and their haircuts always come out looking nice.< /review>

The only thing keeping this from a 1-star is the price. $11 is cheap! I did not go in knowing the price, but it all made sense when it came time to pay the bill: You get what you pay for. The location isn't easy to find and it is cash only, which makes things difficult.

The real issue is the cuts. If you plan to ask for anything more than "a number X on the sides and a Y on top" go somewhere else. I have a strong suspicion the word "fade" is not something this shop is familiar with. I will have to go somewhere else today to get my cut fixed.

For my young son, his cut was passable, but not anywhere near what I asked for.< /Text>

Captain Mike and his crew are professionals that can handle any kind of haircut. Fair price and done quickly. Be aware they are cash only.</text>

Such a fun atmosphere. What guy doesn't want a haircut from Captain Mike? Great prices but it's cash only! My husband and my cranky three-year-old both walked out with great haircuts!< /review>

Very patient barbers who know how to cut young kids hair. My son had his hair cut here twice by two different people, both times his hair came out great.</Review>

I went there yesterday to get a haircut Bob asked. What are we doing for you today? I said I want a medium hair cut on the top short on the sides block the back and a little trim around the ears. He said that's too much information. I ended up with a bad haircut , Bob the barber doesn't even like fishing.</Review>

<text>I really enjoyed my visit on a Thursday afternoon. Crowds were light, exhibits and park were clean, and animals seemed happy. As a zoo lover, I've been to some great zoos (Santa Paula) and some terrible zoos that should be shut down, but this one rates toward the top and their animals all seem pretty happy.< /text></record>

I was afraid I  Would disturb the rest of the theater so I went outside so as not to bother anybody to my dismay I was told I was not allowed to re enter the theater once the play had started.  I had gone with a friend who had to set through the rest of the play wondering what had happened to me very disappointed in the theaters policies have never gone back<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

This very fine theater presents some of the most outstanding plays you will ever see anywhere!  Everything we have ever seen has been excellent--the plays, the actors and the venue are truly unique and special.  This is one of Santa Paula's finest attractions!< /Review>

Full disclosures is real people's stories told by those real people, with flair. Great architecture, reasonable prices, adult beverages at intermission.  What more could you ask.</Review>

I thoroughly enjoyed the Santa Paula Theater Center's production of Second Samuel, a poignant comedy they staged this summer (2013).  I don't like to read too much about a play before seeing one, preferring to experience it as the playwright's conversation with me, and so I took my seat with no expectations.  From the opening scene, I instantly fell in love with this production and stayed in love with it from start to finish.  The costumes and sets took me to a small town in Georgia that I still revisit in my mind.  The brilliant writing, acting and direction left me with questions I still ponder.  What makes any of us "too different" from the rest?  And what differences do our differences make?  Bravo to SPTC!  I'll be back to be entertained and enlightened by you again.< /Review>

Normally I would not leave a negative review but my experience with the Chula Vista office was terribly disappointing and I don’t want anyone to experience what I have and spend so much money and not get what they needed. I had to go back on three different occasions after my initial exam because I was given glasses with the wrong prescription, then another time the wrong measurements, another time because one pair wasn’t ready, and the frames for both glasses I purchased were flimsy and cheap not like the first time I bought here. The staff was nice but the service provided was not professional.

A few things I would recommend would be to make sure you receive the proper prescription, and the correct measurements and you’re working with staff members that know how to do these things properly. I understand your eyes may need time to adjust to the new hardware but they gave me headaches and I could not see except for the very BOTTOM of the lenses. And when I say bottom, without exaggeration, I mean almost the rim of the bottom of the glasses.

After trying to make it work and not wanting to go back a fifth time, I decided to go elsewhere and they gave me another prescription and my eyes are SO MUCH BETTER. Plus I received excellent quality service and glasses within record timing.

I apologize for the negative review but this must be taken care and addressed with staff because these are our eyes which need the utmost care.</Review>

I got two glasses one eyeglasses were fine, but my second eyeglasses had higher prescription  on my left eye. They took my eyeglasses and they were going to fix it. I didn’t get call or text. I came today to see what happen and yes they had my glasses, but it was not fix plus they scratched the frame 😠. Now, I’m waiting here, hopefully this get fix soon. I’ll update If I get help.
Manager-try to help me but they had to many people for Saturday. Hopefully once my glasses are ready they call me. I’ll update maybe they get more stars.<//Review>

<review>They have a $59.95 promotion where you can get 2 glasses and an eye exam. It's a pretty good deal but watch out for the limited stock of these promotional glasses and the upsales!  There are only a  limited amount of these promotional glasses, like 20 pairs per section (men's, women's, etc). All the other glasses are priced higher and you get to pay for the more expensive of the 2 that you decide to get.  Then, if you want thinner lenses, bifocals, progressive, tinting or any extra niceties, it'll cost you more, sometimes a lot more. In addition, there were only 3 employees there and they were always juggling customers.

The day I went in, there wasn't an optometrist on the premises (Only on Mondays, apparently) so my eye exam was conducted remotely by a person on a computer monitor. She did a good job and produced a prescription for me. However, it was just for glasses and they needed to contact the doctor to get an updated prescription for contacts. That took an hour so I asked them what the holdup was and they said that they have to get an approval from the remote doctor but they didn't send the contact prescription so the technician has me redo the test again.  All in all, I was in there from 10:15 AM until 1:30 PM. That was way too long! I ended up getting another complete eye exam which they didn't charge me for but that ultimately was good because they got the response from the doctor quickly and I was able to pay my bill and get out eventually.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures></record></dataset><record>

Worst customer service. Do not expect to be seen even if you have an appointment. They always double book even if you have a confirmed appointment. Made another appointment, went in and couldn’t be seen again because the doctor was going to be in vacation that week. Then seems they have an issue if you are not available on THEIR time because of your own works schedule.</text>

Called to get an exam done and have the results put on my form and they told me they can do it. I made an appointment and arrived and as soon as I showed them the form,  to put the results on they did not want to do it and told me that I would have to schedule another appointment to see an optometrist. I’m just trying to get a basic test done which I thought they could provide and they didn’t do it. I went to the national city location and same thing. I wasted two hours of my time for nothing. Go to Wal mart instead. Already scheduled with them and spoke with optometrist and they confirmed they will do the form. Walmart A grade Stanton F grade.<//Text>

<review>I have used Stanton Optical in Tyler Texas several times and experienced great service. I moved back to California and went to the Chula Vista location. Worst experience EVER!!! I went in for a contact lenses exam back in June and ordered contacts. Here I sit 1 month later with no contacts. Every time I call I’m either on hold for 30 or more minutes with no answer or I get transferred around, OR no one can explain what is going on. The people are rude and I can’t find the name of the district or area manager! They get mad when you call and tell you to just go online and check status. My order status has been “In review” all this time. Please don’t go to this location because you will regret it. I sure do!!!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Response>

<rating>5< /rating><Review>From the bad reviews it just seems like they love to complain. This place is busy but it is affordable. I had an appointment and still had a long wait but the staff there is understaffed and they definitely do what they can. The whole process was you go take an eye exam with a licensed eye doctor but like in a Zoom Meeting. After you choose your glasses as you wait to be called up. (This isnt really told to the customer but assuming this would make the best use of your time. The whole time waiting should've been your choosing process.) Once you get called up you get your quote and you choose your choices and pay and go home. Nothing crazy just make and appointment and its like any other eye doctor just more convenient and affordable. I do say because they do have variety of designer and higher end products too.</Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None</Response><Gmap_id>0x80d94e818da3aad1:0x649ba68d0751766<//Gmap_id></record>

I broke my sunglasses and went back in and received another pair and paid my deductible and everything was fine as it was probably my fault. I broke that pair even though I was really careful. When I went back in they no longer had my frames in stock. The lady I spoke to told me she had to order them and if they no longer carried them I would have to choose another design. I told her that was fine just let me know. I waited for 2 weeks and never got a call. I finally called and got the runaround. I had to call 8 times to get an answer. I still don't know for sure what the answer was but the person I talked to said yes they were there and need to bring my lenses in to be installed.

<Text>Overbooked and understaff, they took about 3 hrs to get done with my moms appointment. They  Can’t even help with something as simple as giving you  some glasses that are ready to be picked up without making you wait. If you have time to waste then you won’t care about the wait. I do not recommend and will never be coming back here again. Customer service was average some nice staff and some rude. Forgot to add that it’s not affordable at all! Maybe if you have insurance but I ended up paying more than $300 for some very cheap glasses.< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

If you're in the market for a new pair of glasses I highly recommend you come here. All staff was friendly and helpful. If you're there, ask for Daniel he took care of me, was very insightful, answered all of my questions and I'm sure he'll do the same for you. I went to a bunch of different places and was  told I had to wait about 2 weeks for my glasses to come in. At Stanton I was able to walk out the same day with 2 new pairs. Thanks again🤙🏽🤙🏽🤙🏽<//review>

Don't waste your time. Very poor quality services.  1 hour 45 minute wait, 15 minute exam through a freaky tv style monitor.  They wanted another appointment with a "real"  doctor. In a week. Dingbat females working there were very unknowlageable rude, unprofessional and unpleasant to deal with. NEVER AGAIN.<//review>

<review>Beware all! At first when you go there they are very helpful. But when they haf my mom return to pick up her glasses the RX was completely off...she had to be reschedule 3rd time coming to the office with an appointment only to be seen later than her appointed time. They got her money...mind you she is a senior citizen...she was soo dissatisfied and upset they didnt keep her appointed time...she returned both glasses that day asked for a refund...here we are a month later $120 is alot of money and now they will be persued by an attorney. They said corporate will issue a check when she gave them cash... Smh once they have your money...they take FOREVER to respond. I have called corporate office and this office and no one wants to answer questions why its taking sooo long. Don't go here. Customer service is horrible.<//review>< pictures>

<Review>Really bad experience, they advertise 2 pairs for $50.95 including eye exam. They ended up charging me.$300 for 2 pairs, my son really needed them so I got them, less than 1 month after buying them both frames broke. I took them back because "they had insurance".  Until today is been 1 month from that day and now the frame is lost and my son has no glasses. It sucks don't go there. I'm here and there is 4 angry customers. Worst customer service worst quality products.<//Review>< gmap_id>

Wasted $89 for contacts prescription. Optometrist only comes every Saturday. Took me 2.5 months to NOT getting my prescription. After asking for a refund in store and getting denied , called corporate office , they refused refund as well. I explained after 2.5 months and going there 5 or 6 times I should have my prescription ready.
Solution was actually surprisingly simple in my case- 1-800-contacts app from where I ordered before let me order contacts again and they don’t care about prescription expiration. I wish I could get my $89 back though< /review>

<username>David Cardenas< /username><review>I ordered two pair of glasses, one pair were lenses that were fitted to my frames, the others were frames and  lenses. They did the eye exam.  I need big vocals they measured me  and I want transition lenes in one pair and sunglasses in the other well after 3 weeks I finally got one pair .But they  didn't  have bifocal lenses. So I took them back. It's going on one month now still no glasses the ones I got they had to order new lenses.  It will be another two weeks before I'll have glasses.. the service I very poor. And to call them the wait is very long it was a hoable experience and a lot of money .. I didn't  get the 2 for 59 dollar ones because I am particular about my glasses.i give this place a 1 star..</review></record>

< review>
Terrible, they had me waiting  30 minutes before I had to walk up and ask them how much longer It will take for me to go in. Then the front desk lady asked if i had filled out the tablet. I saw this happening to other customers. The Optometrist had people back to back coming into the room to get examined. I never saw her sanitazing the room, as soon as one customer came out she called the other one in right away. She doesn’t desinfect anything and I dont know what the protocols for COVID are here but I know if restaurants are very strict with social distancing and desinfecting, I am guessing any facility with patients should have some sort of protocols.</review>

<rate>1< /rate><review>I must let you all know, the advertisement of 2 pairs for $59 is not true. Which should be almost obvious when they charge $50 for the eye examination. Don't be fooled for an opportunity of a cheap price, take your money somewhere else since you will be paying the same just without the lies.<//review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I went to see if they could repair the tint on my prescription sunglasses. Because i was past my warranty by a few days, it was going to cost me $130. Even under warranty, i would pay $80. These glasses cost me $280. The glasses would of been cheaper at walmart but i thought paying higher end would be better. Boy was i wrong. Never going back.</text>

Went to Stanton Optical not knowing what to expect. I was instantly greeted by Heather. She went over all the promotions going on in the store. Dr Susan was extremely friendly and efficient. Jerry was also super helpful when I had some questions about what frames would be best. Heather was very patient in explaining whats best for me and took the time to make sure I understood. I will definitely be back to this store and will be referring my family. I am very happy with the service I received! Thanks Heather & Jerry< /Review>

For the very first time since I started wearing prescription glasses, I thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  The optometrist who conducted the eye exam was the BEST!! He was patient and professional.  He didn't make me feel rushed when selecting the correct lens strength.  He asked
specific questions about my eye health and he really listened to me.  The frames staff did not rush / pressure me to make a frame selection.  The  frames were very reasonably priced.  My glasses were ready earlier than the projected pick-up date.  All in all it was a wonderful experience.  Best of all, I can see!!!</Text>

<rating>2< /rating><Text>My glasses broke, so I had to get a new pair quickly. I saw the advertisement for 2 pairs + eye exam for $59, so I was thrilled. Until I got to the store and saw that all 3 frames eligible for the deal were either for children or bright green. So I had to pick a more expensive frame. When I went to purchase, they informed me the only lenses they had in stock were the most expensive ones with a bunch of unnecessary enhancements (what a coincidence). Long story short, I paid $178 when I was advertised $59. Absolute ripoff. And these were for the cheapest frames in the store. I highly regret shopping here, but I needed the glasses ASAP. Do not shop here.< /Text>< Pics>

First of all as soon as we walked in, they greet us with a friendly hellos and smiles (not lots of places do that anymore) then the staff members were awesome by giving us options to what we need and can afford. Jerry and Heather were fantastic, super energetic and aside from having a full place, they were amazing with customer service all around. I'm definitely coming back and already telling my friends and family about the place. Thanks guys!< /review>

<text>This place is a joke! They said they would call when the first pair of glasses were ready to pick up. I didn’t receive a call so we went up there and got them. The 2nd pair was supposed to be ready within 14 days and they said they would call when they came in. 16 days later and still no call. I call them and they put me on hold for 10 minutes and never got back on the line. Frustrated I go there and have been sitting here for about 20 minutes watching them scramble around looking for the glasses. When I asked them if they were having trouble locating them the guy said they were finishing them now. I am guessing they didn’t even bother getting the 2nd pair ready in the 14 days I was told and are rushing to get them ready while we continue to sit here. Needless to say I will not be coming here in the future.</text><Gmap_id>0x80d94e818da3aad1:0x649ba68d0751766</Gmap_id><userid>105986216128073071129<//userid>< rating>

I was very picky, opinionated, and after turning down (4) stores prior to Stanton Optical, determined on not compromising for the style and look that I deserved. Not only was I impressed by the large selection of styles and name brands. But the level of service, knowledge, undivided attentiveness and the overall experience from start to fitting of the Sales Manager was clearly a benchmark above others before. She was very professional, and made my wife and I feel like we knew we entered the right store. Especially after I found exactly what I've been looking for. I'm looking forward to enjoying my new eyes in style now. Bee Gees "Stayin Alive" song in my head as I walk out the store a very satisfied new customer wearing my new prescripts.< /review>

<Text>I was there looking for replacement glasses since mine are getting pretty old and Irma was amazing! Not only was she patient with me while I took my time looking around (I am very picky), but she walked the whole store atleast twice grabbing lenses in colors and styles I kept describing to her even though I insisted she didn't have to. She even cleaned up the piles of glasses as quickly as she brought them to me. Great customer service and I will continue to use them.< /Text>< response>

<review>I love this store, especially the staff that greeted us with an awesome smile. Throughout our visit Jesse the manager in training was attentive in asking us question and making sure we were taken care of. The rest of the staff was also amazing with customer service. Plus he is bilingual so it made our experience way easier and faster.<//review>< Pictures>

They treated me like a Queen! Everyone was professional and well trained. I was seen at my appt time which we all know doesnt happen all the time. I cant say enough things about the staff but the following words come to mind: Stupendous, outstanding, perfect, marvelous, wonderful, excellent. I had a very pleasant experience here and I highly recommend it.<//Review>

My wife and I went there last week, the place was packed, however we were helped pretty quick.
The girl (I lliana)  that did our pre-exam test was very attentive and knowledgeable and the doctor knew her job very well, Nick the manager was super good, very knowledgeable as well and gave us really good recommendations to buy for our glasses, we’re very anxious to receive our new glasses and we most definitely recommend this store to all friends and family. We had a really bad experience last year with another glasses company and we were a little scared to go through the same but the opposite way, our experience here was amazing.</review>

I was referred by a friend. The staff is very kind and extremely helpful, and they have lots of styles to choose from. They informed me that they would give me a call once ready and I never received a call of sort. I gave them an out of state address to send my order to and that info was never noted down (idk how if info was repeated to me twice).. point is, I had to call customer service and give them my new address. If I wouldn't of called, my order would still be sitting in there location. Just a bit disappointed.  But i hope this doesn't happen to anyone after me.< /review>

Everyone was super nice and very  helpful. Sometimes picking out glasses alone (especially when you can't see what you look like because you're not wearing your glasses) can be very stressful and overwhelming. But Isabel who helped me out that day not only gave helpful feedback, she ended up picking the glasses I chose for me and I love them! Great pricing packages, guarantees, and even an optional frame club allowing 4 new free frames in the next 2 years with the purchace of just the lenses. Overall great deal especially when some glasses can be done day of and everyone is so nice even if you're picky. Thanks again!</review>

<Review>Descent selection of eye wear,  but the sign on the window is misleading. You'll have to pay for the exam. They try and say you actually save on the purchase of the glasses.  Also you have to be careful who's helping you. The person who helped my wife didn't  say she was buying a pair glasses for men.  She ended up with mens glasses that were too long behind the head.<//Review><pics>None< /pics><Name>izzy montano</Name><time>1546881383514<//time><Resp>{'time': 1548785290872, 'text': 'Hello Izzy Montano\nWe apologize for all the troubles you have gone through in our store.

Worst costumer service ever! They didn’t call me about my order being dones said it would take 3 days and in actuality, it took 2 weeks. When I get there, I wait 45 mins to receive a pair that wasn’t mine but said my pair was discontinued. Thanks for the update? Had to take the wrong pair because all the glasses they had have designs on them if they’re black. My discounted pair were all black. Not a bad company just a bad branch. Would rather take a longer drive to a different one.<//Review>

59.00 is for not attractive glasses and basic lens.  VERY few choices at that price too.  The other better looking glasses are regular price then you need to add the cost of , bifocal fee, progressive lense fee, non glare fee, scratch resist fee, transitions fee.  It takes at least two weeks to get your glasses too since the dont have lab on site.  Still, its just a bit cheaper that Costco which has an awesome FAST lab.  I still have not received my glasses so i dont know if the lab did a good job on the progressive lens.  Will update later.<//Review>

First of all I want to commend on Jerry's efforts, he's patient and very helpful, thank you Jerry for great effort, you're a definet asset to this company. As far as the store, well I think16 days was to long to wait for glasses, and I was pissed that I had to go  back so many times. Especially when I had to go back because one of the lenses kept falling out of the sun glasses. I also don't like that they wanted to be paid before I got the glasses. Would you pay for a car before you drove it, of course not. Aside of all the problems, thanks to Jerry he made the best of it for me and was apologetic for the problems I experienced thru the whole ordeal and I really appreciate it. Thanks again Jerry, you're the best thing about that whole store. Keep up the good work, in my opinion, you should be managing that store.< /text>

<Text>UPDATED REVIEW 12/11/2018 - - -
Okaaay, I came back because of a Groupon that caught my attention. It was $150 for $32. I thought, "hey, now I can get a third awesome pair of glasses!"-- I knew I was going to be paying a little more than expected but.. dang, I almost regretted getting the Groupon at all. Quite the different experience than when I visited and reviewed back in April..

Upon arriving, they had no idea I was coming although I had called ahead and made an appointment. I initially spoke to Ivan who didn't know my name or why I was there. Quite the bummer since I explained everything over the phone. He informed me that I had called 'support line' instead of the actual store. Nevertheless, he was very willing to help me.

As much as he could, at least..

I explained to him I wanted the exact same type of glasses I had ordered back in April and was hoping to get them for the L O W L O W since I had the $150 Groupon. That's when he informed me he would try to "help me out" because he wouldn't be able to use that coupon with the pricing I received before. Maaaaaan.. I didn't get upset but it did make me roll my eyes and it let me know I had walked into a "used car dealership" kind of vibe. Huge bummer and very 'scam-esque'..

As much as Ivan wanted to help, there was still a tug-of-war between him and I. Where he wanted to try to get every single penny he could out of me and I wanted to save every single penny I could. I mean, I walked in there with a Groupon after all~.. I'm clearly trying to save some cash, man!

I wasn't rolling over for him and he (said he) couldn't provide me with the price I was looking for. I had walked in there thinking, "I'll pay $30 for my frames via Amazon, $32 for the Groupon and pay another.. what?.. $30 bucks at Stanton? Heck, let's make it $40 bucks! I'll get another pair for a total of ~$100 for a new pair altogether." -- that was not the case AT ALL. Ivan tried to get me to pay something like.. $170 for BETTER glasses (Ivan, if you're reading this, sorry if I forgot the exact amount, but it was ridiculous, man!). I cleaaarly wasn't having that. He then said something like $130? and that was totally not flying for me.

We WERE NOT on the same page..
Ivan had clearly had enough. I had communicated with him that it really felt like he was on commission and didn't want to go through all struggle. I wanted (again) the L O W L O W . I didn't want him asking him, "what's the most you want to spend today?". Like.. come on, man. Want me to say ten bucks? After some miscommunication, Ivan was visibly frustrated (and I get it.. I was NOT about to pay $100 bucks and he wasn't budging).

He said the magic word: Manager.

Nick came in to save the day.
He was much more understanding and had more power to get me a much more reasonable price. He got me the same pair of glasses I got earlier this year for $55 dollars. I was happy with that. Win some, Lose some.

Unfortunately, after this experience, I wouldn't recommend this store to EVERYONE. If you do decide you're brave enough, make sure you're ready to bargain and fight a little bit, like at the swap meet. Or if you have sales experience, that helps too!

I don't wanna give Nick anything lower than 3 stars after he hooked me up.

04/2018

I'd recommend it.

The price did drag me in, 2 for $69 is pretty awesome.. however, I knew my eyes were pretty bad. I figured the price would get bumped up one way or another.

It was.
I paid $49 for the exam and then was approached with a proposal of $359 for two AMAZING pair of glasses.
But.. there was the price jump.
From $69 to $400. Yikes.

Heather was extremely patient and helpful. We were able to go down to $110 for some lesser quality lenses. That plus the $49 eye exam. She threw in a few things too.
This didn't seem so bad. My eyes are horrible and require some thick lenses. I gotta be fair!
Ended up paying about $75 a pair.

4/5 stars becaaaause..
Although you can't call them a "SCAM".. you can say they have the intention of luring you in and then trying to upsell you.< /Text>< response>

Stanton Optical gave me a a very great experience! Lots of friendly employees who are very attentive to your needs! I have not worn glasses in about a year so I had nonidea what would look good on me or not. The guy who helped me, Jesse, had a great attitude about his work and lifted the mood of everyone around him, he saw that I was being a bit picky with my selection of frames so he asked me "what is your favorite color?" "Brown!" Jesse disappears for a second and pops back up with at least 6 different pairs of very stylish frames for me! He helped me out a lot with that one because I can never decide! Everyone else at Stanton Optical had a great attitude and  the Optometrist is soooo funny! She is just a character! All together going there and meeting these happy people was very nice and ai am so satisfied with my glasses they are CUTE!!! Thanks everyone at Stanton Optical :)</Text>

< Review>
I have had the best experience since 2019, Carolyn is definitely an asset to the Stanton optical. she is easy to talk to English and Spanish, super sweet and knowledgeable.

Even with the pandemic it felt really comfortable, I didn’t even notice I was wearing glasses and a mask. Perfect atmosphere and customer service 5 Stars<//Review>

<review>Michael was the consummate professional throughout my refinance process. Always timely with returning phone calls, as well as responding to text messages and emails. At all times, Michael kept me up to speed with the refi processes. Towards the end of what was an atypical refinance - every effort was made to get the deal done. I will be contacting Michael and his team next time I’m in need of mortgage assistance.</review>< UserId.>

<Text>Michael helped my husband and I with refinancing our primary home as well as our investment property. By far he is the best loan officer I have ever worked it. He was very helpful and responsive from the beginning of the refinancing process until the very end. Whenever I had a question he would respond right away within a few hours or the next day  the latest. He always kept me up to date with what's going on with our refinance and where we're at with the process. From the time I contacted him to the time we closed it took about a month to close on both properties and we got a very good rate for a 15-year fixed. I would highly recommend Michael Buccella with West Coast mortgage if you're looking to purchase a home or to refinance.</Text>< Pics>

<Review>Originally had contacted Mike regarding a new 30 year mortgage last September. Our agent suggested someone else. We didn't use Mike at the time. We'll middle of December I contacted Mike again to see if he could work out a new 15 year refi on our house.
He contacted us that he was able to help us save some money with the 15 year refinance.
Mike really worked hard to make sure this worked out for us. Great work on his part.</Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Honest, patient, laden with pertinent information, always ready to assist thru the difficult process of buying a home Michael Buccella is all that and more. Mr. Buccella never gave up on me when I backed out of a couple of deals, Michael always kept me upbeat and motivated when I wanted to give up by not giving up on me. Please consider Mr. Buccella for your home loan needs Michael is more than a loan officer Mr. Buccella is a friend when you need it.< /Review>

My experience with Michael was wonderful because he was always very attentive to me and my goals and was always answering my questions and offering up information before I even had to ask.

Would highly recommend him to anyone looking to buy or refinance their home, even if you just have a few questions to ask!< /text>

Buying a house is stressful, there are a lot of unknowns, and without being in the industry it can be confusing. All of those concerns disappeared with Michael. He explained everything in a way that made sense, he anticipated our questions, and he made sure we were fully comfortable with the process. He would answer our questions promptly and efficiently. Whether it was through email or phone call, his words were always understandable and honest.

Michael was consistently advocating for us and supporting us throughout the entire purchase of our home. We will use him again without a doubt!</review>< pics>

I have worked with Michael on a professional level for many years now and his work ethic is quite impressive. He is constantly going above and beyond his normal job functions and performs all of these extra functions on behalf of his clients to provide them with an amazing experience. If you are looking for a loan agent that has your best interest in mind and knows how to close a deal, look no further. 5 stars all around.</review>

I recently worked with Michael on options for refinancing our home loan, and I have never talked with a more helpful agent. After working with three other agencies, his genuine authenticity and thorough explanations were a breath of fresh air in what seemed like an arena of car salesmen. This guy knows his stuff, and truly wants to help you out with your unique situation. I wish we had done our original home loan through him!<//text>

<text>Michael worked with us on our home mortgage refinance recently. The process was quick and painless, and he communicated with us thoroughly and often. We were never left wondering what was happening with the loan process, and he was always happy to explain the things that were happening and what was coming next. His willingness to communicate through text also made it possible for me to gather information during the day when I wouldn't otherwise be able to talk over the phone.

< Review>
It was recently my very great pleasure to work with Michael on a mortgage for my new home.  I cannot praise him highly enough.  From my initial contact with him until the close of escrow, Michael worked tirelessly to find me the right mortgage and finalize every aspect of it.

Michael is very knowledgeable about the types of mortgage available and explained every option to me in very detailed emails and conversations.  He fully answered every question I had and usually anticipated my next question. In addition, he gladly responded to my numerous requests for "what it would look like" in different mortgage scenarios, based on varying down payments, house prices, etc.

Communication is the key to any undertaking involving more than one person, and Michael is one of the best communicators I have ever worked with.  His responses to my emails were lightning quick.  His explanations were very clear, easy to understand, and thorough. He kept me updated at all times about how the process was moving along, and he was able to meet my need for a three-week escrow closing.

Additionally, Michael's cheerful, upbeat personality and positive attitude made the entire transaction relatively pain free.  It was truly a delight working with Michael on my mortgage needs, and one could not go wrong in using his services.</Review>

<review>Michael helped me to get into a home when no one else would.  I'm a single mother, I don't make a ton of money, and other lenders lied to me and wouldn't go the extra mile to help me.  Michael DID!!  He helped me to understand the process and REALLY listened to what my needs were.  Michael never lost patience with me throughout the process and explained things to me numerous times, even though he didn't have to.  He made this very stressful process one of the very best experiences of my life.  I would HIGHLY recommend him for single moms and for anyone shopping for a lender who says NO.  Michael will find a way for you.  He is very honest and if he can't help you, he'll tell you how to fix it so you can get into the house of your dreams like I did. Michael is the BOMB!!!< /review>< Resp>

Michael was an absolute rockstar at his job. When a lender gave a rate higher than it originally quoted he worked overtime to secure a second loan at a lower rate.

<Text>First time looking into anything related to buying a home and had a million questions and was unsure about a LOT of things. Michael really took the time to answer all my questions and explain them in a way that made sense. Even things off from the main topic that I was just curious about.  He always asked me if I understood as he was explaining to make sure I was following and if not he really took the time to figure out how to make it clearer. He also advised me of things to stay away from even though other lenders or banks may try to suggest. I have a history of getting screwed over and have a hard time trusting but he was super honest and took so much of the stress and anxiety out of looking into home mortgages. He didnt rush our conversation and he was honestly one of THE nicest people I have ever met. I am an army veteran with a baby on the way and like most of us I was going through a hard time and really needed to be smart about buying a home and unsure about VA lending as well. He made this process so easy and took care of everything he could for me and I urge you to give Michael the chance to do the same for you. I took the time to write this because I really want other people in a similar position as mine to reach out to him and have him help you like he did for me, you'll be extremely glad you did.

<Text>My experience was great! What I enjoyed specifically was working with Michael! As a first time re-fi client I wasn't sure what to think, but he made the refinancing process simple and easy for me to understand. Michael did a great job helping me navigate through all of the different steps entailed. I appreciated his honest feedback and his prompt notifications and responses when communicating throughout the process.

I found, Michael's knowledge of the Real Estate industry to be on par or a cut above other professionals within the field. I had the ability to refinance locally in Colorado, but after some conversations with Michael, I felt more comfortable working with him, and chose to work with him instead. I would highly recommend Michael to anyone looking to finance a new home or re-fi an existing home.

Great job, Michael!</Text><pics>None</pics><response>{'time': 1552414017920, 'text': 'Hi Peter!\n\nI am very grateful that you chose to work with me and I am glad the experience was ideal for you as well.

This young man was/is a friend of my son, and when he heard I was looking to refinance my home, to pay off debt, get better interest rate, he popped in with no high pressure pitches about picking him.  Instead, he ran the numbers and came back with an awesome deal.  He actually saved me from making a huge mistake with another company, who, unbeknownst to me, was giving me a horrible deal.  He not only gave me the greatest deal, he did it freely, honestly, and with the most integrity from anyone I've ever dealt with.  He could have "slightly" beaten the other deal, but he did better than that.  I would freely, honestly, and warmly recommend this young man and his company, West Coast Mortgage, to anyone looking for a stress free, easy refi.  He and his company kept me constantly up to date, never worrying about what was going on. I could go on, but I think you get the idea.  =)</review>< Pics>

I recently purchased my first house and had a million questions for Michael about getting it financed. He had or found the answer to each one and ALWAYS responded very quickly. On many occasions, I even reached out to him outside of normal working hours and still received the same responsiveness and attention to my questions.

Michael was always open to a friendly and knowledgeable discussion, even when I had questions that he had previously answered multiple times. I like to be hands-on for these huge decisions and quickly realized there was a lot I didn't know about home financing. But I could always rest assured, knowing that Michael thoroughly understood the mortgage industry and was looking out for my best interest.

Even though I live in Colorado, I decided to work with Michael and West Coast Mortgage based on personal recommendations. He helped make this whole process as smooth as possible and I will definitely use his services in the future.</Text>

Beautiful park for an amazing walk/run/hike. Stream runs the length of the picnic areas and playgrounds. Plenty of green grass areas with shady big trees. But this park main attraction are all the great hiking trails and views.  Beware of bobcats, coyotes and rattlesnakes.<//text>

I recently took my grandchildren and dog to play at this park. This was the park that their father used to visit when he was a little boy. Back then there were animals and a flowing river. I was so happy to see that it is still well maintained. They have 2 great playgrounds and several long winding trails. The park is wide, spacious and very inviting. My grandchildren want to visit again and at that we will have a nice picnic.<//review>

Very nice park to go for a run/walk. Just the thing that bothered me were the rocks on the trail but if you like that then go right for it. I went with my dad for the first time and we really enjoyed it. Really nice views too.<//Review>

Great place to take a minute to enjoy the outdoors with out going to far. Park goes all the way back to hills and a horse stable.  Looks private horses IDK if you can rent for trail rides. Still nice place for a walk or hike if you like.< /text>

A great park to walk around! Came here last week with my dog to view the cherry blossom trees and we weren’t disappointed! The main walking path was lined with dozens of sakura trees, and most of them were in full bloom. This park was spacious + clean, and visiting on a beautiful spring day made the experience even more special. 🌸

Parking: they do charge for parking, so if you don’t want to pay I recommend parking in the small shopping center next to the park.

*Note: this park does require everyone to wear masks! I thought that most people would be maskless but I was pleasantly surprised to see that 99% of the people I passed were wearing one 😊< /Review>

This really is a great park.  So many trails and beautiful hills.   Great place to go and disconnect.  The reason I removed a star is because I was nearly bitten by a rattlesnake.  Just be careful on the trails.  Walk in the center of the trail and look out.<//text>

<Time>1613842890328<//Time><rating>5< /rating><review>Park with playgrounds, hiking trails for all levels, and horseback riding. You can park inside (paid) or try to find street parking along the neighboring areas. It’s located right across the Puente Hills Mall, so you can easily grab a meal or go shipping before/after being at the park. Public restrooms are available and still open during covid. Masks are required.

There are a lot of different trails you can take and there’s workout equipment like pull up bars available. Some of the hikes do get a bit steep, but there are family-friendly options. There’s also a cement path for those looking for a more flat surface. There’s not a lot of shade, so bring a hat and wear sunscreen. There are a lot of picnic tables and I noticed a lot of families/groups using them. There are snakes and mountain lions so be mindful. Overall, this park provides a great way to have access to nature even in the middle of the ‘burbs.<//review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNu342XBllvDWWOm7e9ACwNI2bj83RFoRLywf0f=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5tZwc161aQZTatN19g9LeqI-Qu9Dgfh27R6oq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMIfupl_karQcN5siSndQGktqFY4q1r96r5w9h9=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pictures><resp>None< /resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

After the rain, the sky was extra blue and the air was so clear and fresh. Coming out to Schabarum regional park was the best decision. My wife and I heard that the stay at home locked down order had ended, we immediate decided to come to this park to catch the plum blossom before it’s too late.

This park is the only few of the parks in LA that have cheery and plum trees where they will blossom at the beginning of Spring. Without being able to go to Japan this year to view the Cherry blossom, this place is the closest thing.

It’s kind of interesting to know that in 1992, this park formed a sister relationship with Kairaku-En Park in Japan.

With the rain this week, the flowers are blossoming  with extra beauty. The colors of the flowers, white, red and pink blanketed the whole park. This scenery made you feel like you’re in Japan.

After gluttonous picture taking activities, we decided to hike up the hills to get some exercises. Once we get to the top, we were awed by the beautiful scenery of. The San Gabriel Valley. With the clear blue sky we can see all the way to the snowy top of Angeles Crest.

There are more to do in this park then just viewing cherry and plum blossoms. People come here to play soccer and tennis, picnic, hike, and horse back riding.

For the hikers, the trail here connects to the historic Juan Bautista De Anza National Historic Trail. There are plenty of parkings. Normally the fees for parking is $6. But during the pandemic, it seems that the parking is free. No body is at the gate to collect the fees.<//Text><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNCqxG_WjegYbC5S1uGewdbOnHyRvgiduAB08xn=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url':

<review>Very beautiful park. From cherry blossoms in the spring and hiking in the south end of the park, it’s well worth visiting. However, you have to pay for parking which can be rough, especially on weekends where it’s $5 and park may be overcrowded. But it’s very lovely driving inside the park once you get in.</review>< Pics>

Good for a picnic. Restrooms were in good shape. Toilet seat covers, TP and foaming soap dispensers were well stocked on a Thursday in January 2021.</review>

You can choose from a flat pavement to a more intense incline trail at a higher elevation. One thing I would note is this place have snakes and mountain lions which is typical in a vastness of grassland that considers to be a wilderness. It is advised to accompany with others if you decide to go on a wild hike. Also, there are horses that you can rent at the park if you want to have a wild experience.</Text><GmapID>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d</GmapID>< username>

<date>1616393454276</date><Review>The best local park to see cherry blossoms 🌸 Some are mature trees and some are newly planted
All cherry blossoms trees are donations from dr. Gu at Azusa in remembrance of their son who died in a hiking trip. They chose to turn grief into passion, the love of nature in a form of cherry blossoms which are enjoyed by so many people! While we are mesmerizing with its beauty, we always remember the pain that they went through. The pain of loosing a son who just graduated from university. We should cherish life and be grateful with each family member in our daily life!< /Review><pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM_FKYIGJP16rFeixEpAOZA7SxFzyggoFiw2LjC=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipO5f9oAhd7Wcj5qpsa6EnMBSpw8aXmXzhw2M-6j=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNLwVuRO0AohsKxgdFnHSlaSxLu58gVciOSLmxH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM7G3UHWxzi5Zq3Firif0WSWoMxxo2uxiN-gOmQ=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNc5IaxJCCa-V0PPCCkEXq4yWpQBMqq0yK3u9Bf=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOEV9hPue4rQR28Pe4RwzzDNNLycC5c5Te71VGt=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOG95gMWX9SQmxB8hWZZAAQ7LwhDyatpykAbq7V=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pictures><GmapID>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d< /GmapID><Name>Heidi K<//Name><Response>None</Response><Rating>5<//Rating>< user_id>

Been going three straight weekends Sunday. Been doing the .2.0 m trails that overlooks the park. Great workout,  and also has some machines for stretching  and the front entrance. No so crowded has bbq grills but so far have not seen anyone use it. I've eaten at the tables but thats about it. Has some drinking fountains and bathroom. But just bring your water bottles<//review>

<Text>This place is amazing it has plenty of space for picnics. It has plenty of space for family or friends get together. It has beautiful hiking trails and if you want to know one of them leads to horses. Some of the restrooms are open so you need to pay attention to the sign in the entrance to see which ones are. People take their bikes here so if you want bring yours. If you want a park that has tranquility this is definitely the one for you! My boyfriend and I make this our twice a month adventure.<//Text><name>Giovanna Flammia<//name>< gmap_id>

<text>Nice big park with lots of room to spread out and remain socially distant. Most people wear masks, at least when they get near other people which is also comforting. There is a lot to explore in the park, I just wish people would take better care of the park and pick up their trash. There is a lot of small pieces of litter in the park.< /text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

Free parking on weekdays and late afternoon on weekends.The best time to go is after a big rain when the stream is full of water.  Bring your camera. You will want to get some pics.<//Text>< user>

I head down at least once a week for my hike. Its lovely seeing the changing seasons throughout the year. From the park, you're able to see the changing foliage and cherry blossoms, and out on the trails, wildflowers bloom and give way to brush and the like. It's always a treat catching sight of all the wildlife on your way up as well. The trails aren't too daunting, and the park is large and lovely. Would highly recommend visiting with the whole family.</review>

One of my favorite places in the San Gabriel Valley. Schabarum Park is the best way to "get out there" without really leaving suburban LA. There are miles of trails teeming with wildlife to be explored on foot, bike or horseback. Some trails are easy and popular with somebody always within eyesight. Others are more remote and it's easy to forget you're a few miles away from a mall. They do charge for parking on the weekends, so park across the street in the mall lot and walk over.< /text>

<review>This park is very large with plenty of parking for $6. Lots of land throughout this park with plenty of shade.lots of picnic tables and BBQ's. hiking trails for hikers and mountain bike riders. Also great for horses to take on this park with lots of terrain and hills throughout this area.great to bring the kids for gatherings and special occasions such as B-days or jus for families or friends to enjoy a little outdoor activities.lots of wildlife out here also. Be watchful for the kid's due to lots of cars coming and going throughout the day at this park.</review>< Pictures>

Great huge little park. I did not know it had trails. This is a great place for us that do not have Griffith park around the corner.
Horseback riding as well and you can also bike here.</review>

The park itself if beautiful, and also allows access to miles of wilderness trails into the hills.  The trails allow walking, running, biking, and horseback riding.  Trails are closed for two days after rains.  Passing signs that indicate the trails are closed can result in a citation with a fine.  The trails are beautiful all year long and provide many views of wildlife and the cities below.<//Review>

<review>Went on a weekend and there were lots of homeless people and trash scattered around the park (canned food, plastic wrappers, etc). The entry costs $6 per car. If you're paying to come here, I'd recommend you look for other regional parks in the area as they're more likely to be cleaner and be bigger</review></record></dataset><record>

WOW! THIS PARK IS AMAZING!!!!!  Just being in this natural beautiful place is just a little slice of paradise in the LA county area. Who would've guessed this gem of a place would be tucked away so sweetly. I saw so many squirrels, rabbits, butterflies and so much more!

I will be back to take another relaxing nature walk.

P.s PLEASE WEAR YOUR MASK! LOTS OF PEOPLE IN THE AREA! ❤️</Review>

Great trails up the hills with interesting climbs, for easy walking, mountain cycling and outdoor family fun. You will get a good exercise on this trail with great views.

Then come down and enjoy the greenery of the park if you want to do easy scooting rides, pushing baby prams with wide spacing to ensure everyone gets the exercising without crowding. Family enjoyed our outing here.<//review>

<rate>1<//rate><Review>Got hint that there was cherry blossoms blooming around the time I went.  I guess I just missed it or something was astray. I saw one tree bloom but it was too small to make dent int the experience. So,I said hey how about the hiking trail. The trail is great for beginners but I found forks that had no map direction. The experience probably would have been better granted I didn't get charge to visit a park. I never heard of that until I came here. To rub salt in the wound, 30 mins later there no one was charging to park. I guess we drew the luck of the draw. Maybe , next time will be a better experience.</Review>< Gmap_id>

We were here to see the cherry blossoms.  There aren't lots of trees but good enough to take some pretty pictures.  Weekdays are less people with no parking fee charged.  When you enter to the front entrance, you'll keep driving down until you see the horse ranch on the left.  That's where all the pretty cherry blossoms are.</text>

Went there for cherry blossom but the big cherry blossom trees in the back of the park have no flowers. It's a wide park. Go there get sone fresh air, walking around see people and small cherry blossom trees are blooming.< /Review>

I love bringing my dogs to this park. I get a long line and train my dog. It's pet friendly. Deeper into the park there is a trail I take my dogs to as well. It's free on the weekdays. On the weekends I park along a side street.<//Review>

<Review>Any park with an exercise area AND a hiking trail is automatically dope. Not to mention that it's so pretty, and the view up top is fantastic. Hike, exercise, play tennis(!), or just chill and have a picnic, whatever you wanna do it's a great park for it.<//Review>< Rating>

This is a huge park. There are trails, abundance of picnic tables with grills, parking spots, public restrooms and grassy areas to choose from. Great for walking, jogging and biking. The signs say no drones and skateboards are allowed. This was a great spot to walk our dog, she sure loved it. Watch out for snakes and mountain lions in the hills/trails. Make sure to check out their dedicated butterfly and humming bird area sanctuary next to the amphitheater.<//Review>

Our second time visiting this park. I enjoyed it this time as much as the first. The park is huge and has different kid/pet friendly trails. Not sure if this Park is busy during Summer season will have to give that a try in a few months. Today's visit was awesome with our big family.  We were able to have the end side of the park all to ourselves. Highly recommend.</text>

I'm only giving this place 1 star, and they are lucky to even get that. These silly people that run this park do not allow drones there, for what reason I don't know. Get over it people it's a form of photography and videography. You all that are against quadcopter's are watching to many movies,  If you think people are trying to spy on you when they are flying.  I'm guessing the people that are against drones are mad also or upset because they can't afford a drone, a nice drone I should say.  Save up!< /text>

Safe place to hike during covid-19. Most people are cautious and wearing masks and social distancing. Great for getting adventurous hiking miles in the morning.<//text>

I love bringing my dogs to this park. I get a long line and train my dog. It's pet friendly. Deeper into the park there is a trail I take my dogs to as well. It's free on the weekdays. On the weekends I park along a side street.<//Review>

I've been coming here since I was very little. Though some things have changed, it's still my favorite regional park of all time.</text>

Nice trails, a few playground areas, an exercise area, picnic areas, some informative signs about the animals, insects and plants along one of the paved paths and if you play pokemon go some stops and gyms with decent spawns along the paved paths</text>

I only go during the week as entrance to the park is free. They charge to go in with your vehicle on weekends. This park has a few trails that are fun to walk, run, or hike. Also has a ton of picknick areas with charcoal grills. Great for groups, kids and well, everyone.< /review>

<Text>This park is free to public during weekdays. The gate for vehicles to enter closes at about 5:30PM, so make sure to get there before that time. There are good amount of trails for people to wonder around, and some nice green lawns for people to play on. Overall a good park to visit.< /Text>< Resp>

<gmapID>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d<//gmapID><review>This has nothing to do with the park itself. It's lovely there and for the majority of the time it's clean. I have in the past reccomended all my family and friends to visit here. So, I'm extremely  bummed I'm posting this review: it's become clear, from my last couple of visits, they're not implementing masks wearing for vistors and within the staff out on site. Also, the park has slowly become more congested these last past weeks. Please correct this!<//review>< date>

The park is beautiful and has so much to offer.  It is perfect for hiking, picnics and gatherings.  The one thing we did notice is that there are various trees that are dying or dead.  We were curious if it was due to improper care,  irrigation or a tree disease?< /review>

<review>This is a great place to hike, picnic, or take your kids. Free parking on weekdays (except for holidays),  a 2-mile hiking trail around the park, an even longer trail for people more fit than me, horse stables with riding classes, multiple play areas for kids, an outdoor body-resistance gym area for adults, and numerous grassy & wooded areas to explore. This has become my personal place to just get away.< /review><pictures>None<//pictures><Rating>5< /Rating><name>Zach Wilson (RakuenWolf)</name></record>

Nice trails, a few playground areas, an exercise area, picnic areas, some informative signs about the animals, insects and plants along one of the paved paths and if you play pokemon go some stops and gyms with decent spawns along the paved paths</Text>

Great park during the week. Costs something on the weekend but I've never done that. Lots of shade and the property goes on for quite a ways. Horse ranch at the very back. Several play areas for the kids. An outdoor exercise center for those folks who want to do that in public. Nice place to catch Pokemon too.<//review>

I only go during the week as entrance to the park is free. They charge to go in with your vehicle on weekends. This park has a few trails that are fun to walk, run, or hike. Also has a ton of picknick areas with charcoal grills. Great for groups, kids and well, everyone.< /Review>

Beautiful park, and I've only seen 1% of it! It gets pretty busy so if you do come via car plan on being patient when parking as cars enter and exit. When I was there working on one of the several picnic tables I heard several car horns.

Four stars because the bathrooms were very gross and this was at 9 in the morning so you could tell they don't clean them overnight. Also picnic tables were very dirty and sticky. It wasn't from the trees, it was from beverages being spilled and other sorts that made it sticky.< /Review>

<review>Nice retreat from the suburban sprawl. Great picnic areas to reserve for BBQ's & gatherings. This regional park offers hiking, running, horseback riding, trail biking, tennis courts, amphitheater, playgrounds for kids, free summer concerts, nature to explore and re-creation for all. Support the park - pay the minimal parking fee!< /review>< GmapID>

A great local regional park with trails, play grounds, creek and picnic area with grills.  You can decide how far and how long of time you would like to walk on trails.  You may cross the top of hills and walk to the other side of Fullerton.  Also horse trails inside the end of the park, and you may arrange horse rides.< /Text>

Great spot for a mild hike. They charge for parking on the weekends and any major holiday, I think like 8 bucks. Saw a rattlesnake right on the trail slithering into the sides, so definitely don't have your kids running too far ahead. You could also bbq with plenty of shade.</Text>

This park is pretty expansive. It's got good trails, nice playgrounds, good looking trees. It goes a mile or so back in with parking so there's plenty of space. They do charge entry on weekends and holidays, the rates all seemed to be under $10. I plan on coming here frequently, it seems to be a great place to get some easy steps in<//review>

Nice trail for some weekend walk.  The view is nice and overall easy to finish as there are a few ways to cut the distance short as needed (easier side path or same way back).  The trail is about 4 people wide at most places, so no need to worry about limited walking space.<//review>

<review>Gotta say it's a nice park. Decent size not real big but easy in and out of the place. Close to lots of shopping centers. Right in the city but feels like your in a bigger park further from the city.. Never new it was there but went to a car show held there and was a great spot</review>< pictures>

<review>This is my favorite part because of the combination of natural, Wild open spaces where you can hike and encounter wildlife, and for the beautifully designed strip down the main thoroughfare which is perfectly balanced and spaced-out for you to the rental Pagoda, play tennis, have a party, let the children run loose on the playground, or meditate and there is also horseback riding at the very back of the park. This is a wonderful Park<//review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Response>

<text>Regional Park that provides adequate recreational activities for all age alike. Hikers and trail seekers have abundant place to do their trek. Plants and wildlife abounds. The only thing is seeing some trash on the small creek that runs through the park, although not a lot it ruins the natural habitat of some animals, who might be living in that creek. The management should post more warning signs about trash responsibilities to all visitors.<//text><Date>1553743728826<//Date>< rating>

While staying at the Courtyard Mariott hotel, I made the short walk to this park.  I walked on the trails that led into the hills at the back of the park.  There was plenty of room on the path.  From the upper levels of the path, the view of the valley was nice.  The area was well maintained.</Text>

My favorite park for hiking with my young children's 4 and 6, because the distance is about a mile or so and it's just perfect for the children and I still there's one thing I don't like it lately people they started chopping off trees along the trail</review>

Dont like paying $ 6.00 bucks to park . Saw some improvements to the park , but I know that alot of the work gets done buy people working off community service.  The county gets paid to have these people work for free.</Text>

I love this park,  but only 3 of the 6 fountains i tried while walking the trails on a 95° day were working and  the bathrooms were locked at 3pm on a Sunday.</Review>

Hey this: It's across the street from a mall and a Soup Plantation, a mall, a costco, a movie theater, a bowling alley and so much more yet you can hike, ride a horse, play several sports, enjoy scenic views and wildlife and awesome and clean amenities for kids. Not to mention the awesome staff. Did I mention the urgent care and daiso right next door.< /Text>

I come here for getting my exercise of the week in. Running up from the base near the exercise equipment, it's an uphill battle through relaxing and fulfilling scenery. Last time i went, some Sneaky McSneaks put a snake corpse at the end of a pedestrian bridge (think of how cats respond to cucumbers).

There are lots and lots of bbq grills, with plenty of restrooms and multiple children's play structures.< /Review>

Good place to hang out with the girlfriend. We grab our food to go from the noodle place across the street and come have a picnic here. Plenty of space and tables. Even when there are many people the park is large enough to find privacy and eat a meal in peace. Keep in mind that the restrooms close when the front booth does. This place is worth the admission price($6) if your going to spend a good part of your day here. Go up the hill high enough and you see a good view of the surrounding areas.<//Review>

I love the hills and the different views from this rustic park.   You feel like you are in the mountains yet it is so accessible from the main street and you find yourself enjoying the beautiful nature in 5 minutes time.< /Text>

This is so much more than a park! Came here for a hike with a friend I hadn't seen in far too long, and we just explored and wandered around -- finding trails on hillsides that looked totally removed from the city, the horse stables, the tennis courts, and lots of lovely paved roads too. This park is the perfect spot for family fun days outside, picnics, engagement pictures, etc. It's right across the street from Puente Hills Mall, so if you don't want to pay for parking on the weekends or can't find a spot, head to the mall and walk across the street.

There's a few playgrounds and tons of clean bathrooms. Many groups use the park for weekend salsa, yoga, soccer lessons, etc. Wonderful community space and a great outdoors area for the inland empire.<//text>

I've been going to this park for a long time! It is a lot of fun and quite expansive. I like to stroll through the winding paths, then take a nice hike in the chaparral covered hills that have a great view. The park is also full of beautiful trees and healthy grass which make it a great picnic spot< /text>

There's a few playgrounds and tons of clean bathrooms. Many groups use the park for weekend salsa, yoga, soccer lessons, etc. Wonderful community space and a great outdoors area for the inland empire.< /Review>

<review>Schabarum Regional Park is one of those hidden gems in the larger LA area.  Despite being right next to one of the busiest freeways in the city, this is one of the cleanest and quietest parks I have ever been to.  It has great hiking trails and plenty of picnic areas.

I happen to go on a Sunday for a light picnic.  The weather was great for a picnic as the trees would alleviate from the heat, yet there were no picnic-ers.  Perhaps it had something to do with the $6 parking fee.  I thought this to be a small fee to pay for having a quiet picnic.  Sometimes you do want a large space just to yourself.< /review>< Pics>

Clean, well maintained big Park. Lots of trails to explore. Most benches and bbq sections are amongst the shade of pine or eucalyptus trees. 3 playgrounds for the kids, at the far end of the park there are horse stables. Not entirely sure if you can rent them to ride though.< /review>

Have been coming here quite a bit to hike, and I love this park! Free parking during the week, but you must pay on the weekends. Hikes are nice, and trail is kept up. Typical busy trail hours are anytime after 6pm during the week, and anytime after 7am during the weekend.<//Text>

<Review>there are a lot of winding trails in this park and different routes to walk around through. the trail is well maintained and pretty busy the later in the afternoon it gets. i suggest get here early and leave early as well. overall, it's an easy to get to location and it's close to home. there is somewhat of a difficulty when it comes to finding and parking there though.<//Review><time>1527529550378<//time></record></dataset><record>

Great place for a morning or night walk, dog friendly, next to the 60 fwy, and yet so refreshing! They offer free concerts on Tuesdays throughout the summer. If you are driving there be ready to pay for parking. There are several nice and big areas for picnic, you may need to call to reserve though.</Review>

They need to have someone patrol the area at all times, especially being a popular park, I've been coming here for years and I don't want to see it go to ruin. I took my daughter and there were drug addicts by the bathroom doing what they do best in front of kids!! A lady yelling and walking back and forth talking to herself and scaring the children.< /Review>

Lots of parking throughout the park. Bathrooms ok the few times I've gone in. Great trails and beautiful views. Some family tried to close off the bridge leading to the jungle gym area one Satyrday because they reserved the tables for a party. A park worker found out or was informed of this and quickly came over to tell them they can't block access, and that they only have reservations to the tables and not the whole area, which is used by other families and children and pokemon players.
The grounds are nice, I have yet to step on any dog poop which is a huge plus. Dog walkers are considerate and restrain their pets and clean up after them. Just overall a really nice place for a hike, dog walking, picnics, and public events like the pet adoptions, music shows, and pokemon community days<//Review>

Never have a bad experience here. There are picnic tables throughout, restrooms located every so often, and playgrounds for children to enjoy. Bring your dog too and enjoy the hiking available (just be sure to have them leashed as it is a leashed park only for pets). Beautiful scenery and lots of open space to picnic.<//Text>

It was not a hike I expected because it was like a walk into the park at first (at least the trail we took) with cherry blossoms surrounding you which were pretty and then it got steeper barren hills. The view over the hill was awesome though, especially since I got to be close to the electric towers and saw a beautiful view of the city.

Bad part was $6 for parking which was a surprised when we entered this place, but at least I had a good time and went to 85 degrees after which was directly across from this place. Cool place to check out and then there are many places to eat and walk around it.</text>< pictures>

Great paved walking paths and some hiking trails. The park is well maintained. Decent amount of pokestops but as you move further into the park, reception can be spotty. Has two tennis courts where there is normally a wait to play. There is also a park admission fee for vehicles depending on day and time. Park closes at sunset.</Text>

<Text>Nice trails, well maintained picnic spots n BBQ grills. Horseback riding available and a good view from top of the city. There is considerable elevation and downhill at places so make sure you pace up/down per your ability.< /Text>< pictures>

This a great park to visit for some fresh air. Lots of open space to walk around and plenty of green grass to enjoy. There are even some workout benches alongside some of the trails, and there was a camping area at one end of the park. As a side note, it is now frequented by Pokemon GO players.<//Review>

Tough hike!!! I love it!!! Takes me about 2 1/2 hours to finish the entire thing, to the very top and back. Lots of steep inclines, I suggest packing snacks and DEFINITELY some water if you plan on completing it too 👌🏼</Review>

A place where people of all ages and ethnic groups can be found using the wide public spaces available in this park. Numerous hiking trails of varying difficulty, as well as play areas for kids as well. You can call the city to reserve picnic tables, as well as other spaces for private events. Overall, a great public recreation area that meets the needs of the local community. Check it out for yourself. Park on side streets for free parking too</Text>

Nice park. Pretty crowded though. Great place to gather for party or weekend bbq. If you looking for a remote hike this isn't the place for you. If your looking for some easy local trails then this is it. Pretty scenery ..flowers trees dogs are ok on leash. There is also a park fee I believe it was $6 . I parked across the street in the mall parking lot for free.</text>

Big park; restrooms near the parking area. Expect to pay a parking fee on the weekend, which helps maintain the park.  Plenty of shade near the parking and restrooms.

The trails can range from moderate to fairly difficult depending on which ones you take. Their are horse trails you can follow and some get really steep. Others are longer and meander along at a much gentler slope. Some of the trails have some shade but be prepared with a hat.

This places get fairly busy in all areas, from the park grass to any of the back trails, so expect to see people.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

By the entrance is great, 3 stops and usually have several people to talk to.

As you go further in though, signal drops a lot. Also, when I was there, the sprinklers were on and spraying one of the main roads up at around 4 PM - 6 PM, which kind of sucks for people walking.</Review>< GmapID>

The weekend (Sat and Sun) is charged for $8 I think.  I like to come here for trail walk.  Sometimes, I will bring my dogs to walk with me.  You can drive your car all the way up and park there.  There is a loop trail about 3.2 miles.  Usually it takes me about 70 mins to walk.<//Text>< Pictures>

<Text>Great for hiking, plenty of park benches.
Parking is $6.00 but you can come and go all day. You can find free parking at the park like near the soccer area which is off Albatross street at Colima.<//Text>< user>

Always a pleasure to visit schabarum. One of the biggest parks in the area with lots of paved trails and hiking trails leading up to the hills. Plenty of spots to BBQ and picnic as well.</review>

Big park suitable for all types of activities. Has multiple playgrounds, tables and grills, hiking trails, and even a horse stable. Plenty of street parking if you don't want to pay the entrance fees.< /review>

I came here for Bulbasaur during the Pokemon GO craze. It is definitely a park for those with Asian heritage. It can be daunting for people like my fiance who don't share that heritage. Also, it's huge. If you don't want to pay for parking, get there EARLY and park along the street. Get ready for a long but casual hike, if you plan to go all the up the mountain.<//Review>

<text>Great for hikes, bikes, dogs, walks. Great for grandparents and pokecatchers. And grandparent pokecatchers. You can catch a horse ride, explore multiple trails that can go for hours, or make the circle 3-mile small hike around the park. Play tennis, picnic, playground with the kids (but only if they're your own kids). The rain has brought back some of the childhood brooks!! FINALLY. We used to catch tadpoles here.< /text>< user_id>

<Review>Visited this park with my fiance when we first began dating a couple years ago.. we still go. Very serene, I used to like sitting underneath the trees or hiking & hear the wind blow through the trees. There's also wild animals; rabbits squirrels & owls I once even saw a bobcat!! The trails are great, but watch your step!! Theres horse poo & ruts after it rains and gets muddy.<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

Great place to ride a bike.  Some of the trails (the Skyline) can be quite steep so if you are a beginner, stay away for now.  There is a parking fee on weekends so we tend to park on the street beside the park.  No, you cannot park at the Marshalls near by :)< /text>

I really like this park, it has hiking trails, playgrounds, picnic areas where you can have carne asada, lot of trees and squirrels, oh and if you are lucky you'll see bunnies too 😉 Parking is $6, if you want to take fresh air and forget about the city and the smog this is the place!<//review>

<review>Huge park. Amazing for Pokémon Go players with multiple stops, gyms and tons of Pokémon. Biggest problem is people constantly walk in the road way in front of cars instead of the walking paths. Park is free on weekdays, pay on weekends.<//review><Rate>4< /Rate>< name>

REALLY BIG PARK WITH MANY TRAILS THAT GO INTO SORROUNDING CITIES, GREAT VIEWS.. SOME TRAILS ARE A LITTLE TOUGH BUT WELL WORTH THE HIKE..WITH PLENTY OF WAYS TO GET IN...THIS MAKES IT FREE, SINCE THEY CHARGE ON WEEKDAYS I THINK..WEEKENDS IS FREE BUT ..IN REALITY ITS FREE EVERY DAY.. THERES 3 JUNGLE JIMS FOR THE KIDS, THERE A CAMP CIRCLE FOR FIRES OR STORY TELLING..THERES A SOCCER COMPLEX FIELD.THEY HAVE HORSE THAT YOU RENT FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS, ITS AN AWESOME PARK TO HOST EVENTS..PARTIES ETC<//review>

This park is huge. Theres a lot to see in this park and is a perfect  place to get a nice work out just walking around enjoying the scenary. It has a very nice trail you can go up to. Many people take their beautiful dogs and you can even see people on horses come by. It's always filled with happy people and kids. If you play pokemon GO then this is  a perfect place to come as well because of all the pokestops. I have been coming for a year and have yet to see all of it.< /review>

<time>1621949347705< /time><review>(Translated by Google) When I came to LA, it was the first time I came here. It felt very hot, as hot as Phoenix, but at least there are big trees to enjoy the cool and a little green turf.
This park has a big playground area for walking and children (but it’s still too hot at two or three o’clock). However, there are too many police officers. I see a patrol car every ten minutes. I don’t know. what happen? There is a helicopter when I have to go...it’s really hot when walking here with a child on my back

(Original)
來LA，第一次來這，感覺很熱，跟Phoenix 一樣熱，不過至少這還有大樹可以乘涼、少許的草皮綠衣點最。
這公園有很大可以走路運動、小孩的遊樂區可以讓小孩玩（不過兩三點來這還是太熱）、不過，這警察也太多了，每十分鐘就看到一次巡邏車，不知道發生什麼事？要走時還有直升飛機...背著小孩在這走路，真的很熱...< /review><rate>5</rate>< Pictures>

<review>(Translated by Google) The parking lot is big, there are lots of toilets, the trail course is good, and there are several forked roads, so it's easy to walk around and get back on the way. It's great for kids to play with, and they have exercise equipment.

(Translated by Google) It may be a common natural park in the United States, but it's the first California park I've ever met. Phytoncide, the bush? So good. It is good without separation. It is just nature. As soon as we left, we could climb to the right, and the view of the city was very good. Anyway, it was good. Berry berry. I want to live in California. I grow up every day.

미국에선 흔해 빠진 자연 공원일지 모르지만 내가 처음 겪은 캘리포니아의 공원이라 그런가 피톤치드, 숲향? 너무 좋다. 별거 없이 좋다. 그저 자연이 좋다. 출발하자 마자 오른쪽으로 올라가서 보이는 전경은 도시가 다보여 너무 좋았다. 아무튼 좋았다. 베리베리. 캘리포니아에서 살고 싶은 생각이 든다. 매일매일 무럭무럭 자라난다.</Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) This is Regional Park in the middle of Hacienda Heights and Rowland Heights. Many people are here for hiking, kung fu (tai chi), dancing, horse riding, and tennis cricket. Convenient; there are large areas of cherry blossoms, and the cherry blossoms are quite beautiful.

(Original)
這是Regional Park在Hacienda Heights及Rowland Heights中間，許多人在此健行、練功夫（太極）、舞蹈、騎馬、还有網球埸，地点適中，停車位多，去Hollywood Biwl都有公車站，非常的方便；有大片的樱花，樱花盛开時相当的美。<//text><GmapID>0x80c2d586498d736f:0xeb32b2dcb72b5b6d<//GmapID>< resp>
