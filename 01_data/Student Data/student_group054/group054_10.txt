Gave Port City Locksmith a call and he was at my home in 45 minutes, exactly when he said he would be there. He replaced my truck lock and made me some replacement keys all while working in the rain. Nice guy, would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable locksmith.</Review>

Replied to my quote in minutes, and arrived in less than 30minutes to my location. Professional, best rates, and great customer service! From quote to finish in  under 1 hr! Will use in the future, and will highly recommend to everyone and anyone. (Car keys lost, couldn't start car, old school key, not a fob).< /Review>

<text>Jeff the owner was very helpful.  Came out to my house to try to pick a trailer hitch lock but there was no room to get the pick in to try to unlock it. Didnt charge me for coming out and was very professional. If you have any lock needs this is the guy to count on. A+ service<//text>< Rating>

Excellent service, very professional. We called and he asked us to text a pic of the lock so he would know what he was dealing with to quote us an accurate price. Once we did, he gave us the quote and asked for an address.  We sent to to him and he said he’d be there in 17 minutes, and he arrived a minute sooner!  The lock was a little tricky, and he had to remove the screen door. Didn’t charge anything extra and actually put the screen back on better than it was before. Would definitely recommend for any accidental lockout in Stockton. 5 stars.< /review>

Geff was the only locksmith to call me back after I was locked out of the house for one hour. He made the accommodation of fitting us in during a busy schedule. He came and unlocked our door within a minute. He was very professional and provided good quality service.<//text>

I had lost my only key and key fob to my car, and he came within 30 minutes and was very professional and respectful, and gave me a great deal! He even came back a few days later to help me program my new key fobs(was a complimentary service, man how nice he was)  as I was having some trouble programming them myself. Would definitely recommend and definitely 5/5 stars! Thank you again!</Review>

<text>Port City Locksmith is AWESOME! Came to my house and made a replacement 'chip' key for my wife's car and had it done quickly. Costs a LOT less then the dealer for the same service. I look forward to using them again. I highly recommend Port City Locksmith to anyone who needs a key of any type made.< /text><Date>1547670350483<//Date>< pictures>

I needed a chipped key replacement and everyone else in the city was charging nearly $300. One thing I really liked about Port City was that their prices are clearly listed on the website. Everyone else has you call and get a quote. When I called to finally have them come out he was at my house in 20 minutes. It took him about 30-40 minutes to make 2 chipped keys and sync a new key fob. He was kind, professional and prompt. If I ever have any key issues again Port City will be the first place I call. 10/10 recommend!< /Text>< user_id>

<review>I lost the keys to my car and called multiple locksmiths who charged far too much. Others said they would check their inventory and call me back. That did not happen. I then tried Geff at Port City Locksmith and he promised to call me back in 5 minutes and he did. He gave me a price way better than anyone I had talked to. He showed up in 20 minutes like he said he would. Got the job done and was easy to get along with. I will be getting my spare key from him too.</review>< Pictures>

<Review>Port City Locksmith is AWESOME! Came to my house and made a replacement 'chip' key for my wife's car and had it done quickly. Costs a LOT less then the dealer for the same service. I look forward to using them again. I highly recommend Port City Locksmith to anyone who needs a key of any type made.</Review>< pics>

<Name>Vince Marino</Name><review>Excellent customer service! Geff is very experienced and knowledgeable. He explained how locksmithing is more of an art and not a science. He helped me resolve a difficult auto ignition key problem when all the other major locksmiths in town wouldn’t help. 5 stars!<//review></record>

<review>Geff was great! I recommend Port City Locksmith to anyone who wants quality service. He was very prompt, attentive, & professional. Unfortunately I needed him twice in one day and I was willing to pay full price twice but he gave me an excellent deal on my second go round. Support small business owners as often as possible..<//review><user>107437748571043592865</user>< gmap_id>

Gave him a call and he patiently explained all of my options and what the prices were going to be. He showed up about 10 mins after i called him and he explained everything he was going to do before he started. I got a new key cut and programed in about 20 mins. Very clean and professional service. I would recommend his service to anyone.<//text>

<text>**HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION!!!** Geff from Port City Locksmith saved the day  at my martial arts school today! Made the call and he was out to our business quickly. Had a lockout at the restroom, in which he was able to unlock the door within minutes of arriving at our business. VERY professional, experienced, and efficient, and best of all, extremely courteous. Your business is on our speed dial! THANK YOU SO MUCH! Referring all our friends to Port City Locksmith. If you are in need of a locksmith, you’ve found it here!</text>< user>

<review>This review is long overdue, sorry Jeff hahah. But anyways, Jeff went over the top for me that day I had lost my only key to start my car. He was on time, and was very informative, he definitely knows how to make the time pass. He’s one of the best automobile locksmiths in town, we had reached out to a different locksmith originally and they had referred us to Jeff. He got the job done in under 45 minutes. On top of that it was only $180 out the door to get everything done Port City Locksmith, compared to calling the Toyota Dealership to get everything done, $300 to program the keys and another $200 just for the key alone. Jeff cut us a HUGE deal, and I will forever be grateful for that as a college student struggling to make ends meet. Thanks again, for your automotive key needs these guys do it right. AND fast!<//review><gmap_id>0x80900c0cff790db1:0x720d1ffdf59c2039< /gmap_id><Response>None< /Response>< user>

I got this guys number from a friend. I was at a party and one of my friends locked my keys inside my car. We needed to get to another party to pick someone up. I called and he showed up in 10 minutes. Got my ID and got keys out quick!  Would have paid more than he charged. Overall very good service at a good price. Would recommend to anyone.<//Text>

<Review>I had locked the keys in the trunk of my car. After being told by Honda I had to pay $279 for a key to unlock it, I was extremely upset. I gave Port City Locksmith a call and Geff came immediately. He was professional and got the job done in a timely manner! To top it off it was only $50!!! Thank you so much Geff! I will definately use this company in the future and highly reccomend it to anyone looking for a locksmith!<//Review>< Pictures>

So I had jeff come out got his number through a friend because I lost the key to my Nissan Versa Note 2016. I called he was professional and very nice & he was here with in 20mins with a key ready for me. Gave me a great deal for 2 keys second one is 15$.  He did amazing & fast work I dont even think it took him 30mins to finish . The keys work just fine. He is the best deal in the San Joaquin Valley area. Ive had this done before & you wont find anyone better.  If you don't know much about locksmithing and looking for someone that isn't going to take advantage of you , He is the guy for the job. I will be using him in the future & recommending him to friends & family.< /text>

Highly recommend Geff as anyone's locksmith go to man! I lost my car key and before I stumbled upon port city locksmith I had a diffrent lock smith come out and quote me, and he quoted more then double what port city charged me and let me tell you, replacement car keys are not cheap! Moving forward this company will be my go to. Friendly and professional!< /review>

<Date>1541192984028<//Date><Rating>5</Rating><Text>First Geff was very prompt.  Usually people say about 20 minutes and it can easily be near an hour.  He said 25 minutes and was here in about 22.
I used Geff's Port City Locksmith service to replace a lost key to a convertible.  He had to program the key fob to activate all the features the lost one did in addition to cutting a new key.  He did this relatively quick and was a very nice fellow to talk too while doing it. Everything worked great and he made me a deal on a second key.

Great guy and great service. I was going to put 4 starts because Geff mentioned that a lot of reviews are all 5 and often phony. However he really made my day by getting here so soon and charging me a very fair price. Others I called were higher and some much higher. Plus the with the dealer I would have had to tow it in as well.

Thank Geff.  Good luck in your business and keep an eye on that charger.  :-)<//Text>< Pictures>

I have lived in CA, ID, TN, KY, OK and I have never met such an honest locksmith. Look, all other smiths charge like 80+ for programming a fob for a truck, not this man. I wont say exactly due to his prices can change but lets just say its a steal of a deal.

Very easy to talk to, very professional and dont let dealers scare you that aftermarket fobs wont work. I have a 2013 Ram Sport (all bells n whistles) and it took just 3 minutes and bam it was done. Seriously, check my ptofile I am very harsh on this kind of thing and he has blown me away.

Lets say other lock smiths and dealers wanted to charge me well over 200-300... cut that in half. Oh and he comes to your house no charge fee and fast! Super honest. I am going back to Idaho, wish him well. Thank you again sir.< /text>< pics>

MetaTouch is my go to place whenever I have any issues!  I've run marathons, I am a mother, run a business, and wearing high heels have not helped my body stay in balance. Holden puts me right back into alignment and I find myself standing up straighter, taller and feeling lighter when I leave.  I've been seeing him for years and no matter what issues you are having he will talk them through with you, work with you and help you through it!  I am constantly impressed with him and his staff every single time I go and recommend his services highly!<//review>

Just by looking at you, Holden can tell what's out of balance and he knows exactly how to fix it. I have scoliosis and left shoulder trauma from a car accident. I'm also a triathlete. Holden customized my treatment to target exactly what I needed to continue to train and to just feel good. He also has the best bedside manner; relaxed, chill, and a genuine want for you to be pain-free.

If nothing seems to be working...  THIS WILL!  I'm an active person and have dealt with some chronic pain in my hips and knees. since my mid 20's.  I'm a triathlete; training for an ironman and went to  Holden for help.  His intuition and innovative techniques had me walking out of there AND training 15-20 hours a week pain-free.  I recently broke my wrist and have been seeing Holden to speed up my recovery from the surgery.  My OT can't believe the progress we've made so quickly!  I can't say enough about this place.   It's a life changer..<//Review>

Incredible work performed by Holden. I never really have suffered an injury before, and I had knee pain that popped out of no where. Desperately wanting to get back to my intensive exercising , Holden had me exercising again in 3 days. He taught me more about my body than any doctor specializing in podiatry or scolioses I grew up seeing. Thank you so much for everything! Fantastic experience:)< /review>

Holden is very good at looking at you and knowing where you are unbalanced, bunched up or cramped! He manipulates your muscles, tendons and bones back to where they are supposed to be. I swear I am an inch taller when he is done with me. He also has a dry sense of humor and has me in stitches while he works on me. Holden is an amazing kinesiologist and I am grateful to have him in my life!<//text>

I just saw Holden for much needed alignment. The session went great -- I was seated on time, Holden was very informative and explained the reasoning behind his techniques and the best part is I feel much much better now. It's very clear that exercise alone is not enough to stay healthy and and these sessions are a great starting point. Five Stars for sure.<//Review>

Holden is a miracle worker! I’m so grateful for his healing skills and understanding of the mind and body connection. Yesterday I came to his office with sever neck pain. He gracefully treated my neck and then got to the root of my pain with a full body Energy Healing session! It was extraordinary - just like Gwyneth Paltrow’s recent Goop Lab episode on Energy Healing. I have to say I was a true skeptic of the type of treatment and nothing but a BIG believer now! The healing was instant and I still feel light as a feather today, Thank You Holden!< /review>

Holden is the best, I mean the greatest massage therapist ever.  He's so amazing that each time I go for an appointment, I can't wait until I go
again.  Holden is so thorough, you really feel so relaxed & fully renewed.
It's a family affair with Holden, my family all feel the same about Holden
that is a total therapeutic experience !

I recommend Holden very highly for your personalized and individual treatment, so don't wait to schedule your appointment.</review>

I have used the services of Meta Touch for a few years now, and have always been satisfied by their expertise, their professionalism and their cordial, friendly attitude. Kathy, who has taken care of me  has always left me revived and relaxed after each session. I would recommend Meta Touch  very highly without hesitation or reservations.<//Review>

I started treatment at MetaTouch about a year and a half ago, following a  motorcycle accident which resulted in a fractured L2. I had heard Holden called a "true healer" many times before but only until I was on the table did I understand the truth behind that sentiment.
Holden worked with me for months providing therapeutic massage and significantly impacting my ability to heal. Over the course of several weeks and months we were able to generate blood flow and relieve much of the tension and stiffness that was held in my middle-lower back.
Later, I began acupuncture with Norma. Norma's skill and ability are unparalleled. Acupuncture was intimidating to me at first but with Norma's personable, personalized and educational approach, I felt very comfortable. She is experienced, knowledgeable, and an all around wonderful human.
I recommend MetaTouch to anyone looking for a trustworthy wellness center. Whether recovering from a significant injury or simply looking for some skilled hands to alleviate your stress MetaTouch will take very good care of you, as they continue to do for me.</Text>

<Text>I went to MetaTouch for a couple different issues.  Holden did his assessment on me and then got to work.  When I picture a massage that is to get kinks out and help with specific issues, I picture it not being very comfortable and maybe a bit painful.  With Holden, none of the process was painful and it was super effective! It was amazing and it's great to be in proper alignment with my body!!!  Thank you MetaTouch.</Text><Gmap_id>0x80c2ba173bf4a0e5:0x1e3ac6e0fde2e688<//Gmap_id><user>102666639002264826369</user>< date>

Holden can do magic. Many a time I thought I had major back or hip issues which I thought were permanent but after one session were corrected or much better. I always think, why didn't I come here first . When in doubt try this first !< /Text>

My wife & I have been seeing Holden since September 2007 when I needed physical therapy due to training with Capoeira.
And now as somewhat "Seasoned Citizens" experiencing the normal challenges of getting more mature he has been a God sent blessing to us!
The staff at MetaTouch is courteous, caring and professional.
You won't be disappointed with Holden Zalma & MetaTouch.</Review>

After two pregnancies and breast feeding for about 3 years my body was in need of some TLC. Holden was very warm and personable and made what can be an awkward situation (being half naked under a little sheet) a comfortable and relaxing experience.  I had sprained my back several months earlier and was unsure if I even needed to be "fixed" (as it had more or less healed) but I had some tension in my neck and shoulders and still would feel tingling in my back on occasions. My husband has known Holden for many years now and would always return from his visits with him as if he had seen a miracle worker! I finally decided it was my turn for a change.  Holden gave me a short assessment and pointed out that not only was my neck locked up but my left hip was locked and three ribs were out of place.  Oh the joys of having children! I left MetaTouch feeling loose, relaxed and refreshed.  I would definitely recommend anyone to pay them a visit!< /Text>

Holden is hands down the best massage therapist I have ever had and is so knowledgeable about the body and how everything is interconnected. I rely on him for all my pain issues and keeping me healthy.</Review>

Very friendly people working there. Pretty knowledgeable with their honey and avocado's. Will come back when covid clears up and hopefully take a small tour of their farm. Small parking lot though.< /Text>

This is an organically run family owned farm. I don't want to buy avocados that were picked and then spent two weeks to two months traveling to where I can buy it. I'd rather get my avocados from Rancho Vasquez where they were picked either that day or at least that week. Freshness counts.</review>

<Name>Deckie G< /Name><user>107183256012740441728<//user><text>What a great family.... first time going here this weekend... I eat an avocado most days... so it's nice to have some home grown choices just down the road.
The family explained everything,  how they grow. What they grow. And when they grow.
It was interesting to hear the story of the farm.
We will certainly be back quite often

If you are in the area,  have a visit.<//text><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

There are plenty of toppings to choose from including meats. The sandwiches here are also very good and the service is great and friendly. I come back here quite often so I'm glad they introduced a stamp card system!</Review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipP6J0YaKbisOYBJVVAuIToBsFB_VC3Cd5XMuDsh=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMZny2p-lsuw5ETEvoKbOZHOxGvkIL8pSaDdzpl=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures>< response>

Plate combos come with a meat option and 2 sides ranging from hearty vegetables to french fries and mac and cheese. There are also fantastic salad options with sandwiches as well. This location has plenty of seating and lots of parking. There are some empty retail space around it so there isn’t much of a crowd as it used to be. The food is cooked well and is a fantastic option for a hearty meal. It is fairly priced given the quality and healthy portions. Great variety if options for everyone. Expect around $10-14 on average for an entree.</review><pictures>None<//pictures><resp>None</resp><gmapID>0x80852972dd12ed59:0x4b91071e9f6de5a</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This place is delicious! For college students, it is a bit pricey because you have to pay for everything separately.  However, the sandwiches, fries and mashed potatoes are delicious!<//review>

On a side note, they only offer "Main" salads. They got rid of the "side" salad option.<//text>< response>

Big salads at a reasonable price. Sandwiches are good too but the best part is the garlic potato rings. Good place for those looking for a quick healthy lunch.</review>

Excellent! Salads built in front of you with anything you want...add some great grilled flank steak...Friends had sandwiches they really enjoyed. I’ll be looking for Pluto’s again! They make food the way I make it.< /Review>

I feel like a rabbit (in the best way) when I eat here. If you're like me (too lazy to make a dang salad, on occasion), this place is excellent. I've tried most of the salad toppings and everything is always very fresh. My boyfriend says their tri-tip sandwiches are "amazing", though I can't personally vouch for them. The rosemary focaccia bread that is added to salad orders is very good. I always wind up wanting more than the seven toppings that come with a large salad order (and I'm never able to finish a large salad by myself), but wanting more of what you see at a restaurant is never a bad thing. Go here if you really like a tasty, filling salad.< /Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Great salads and more.

Plutos has a large salad bar.  You select your size (small is more than enough for one person) and lettuce type, along with seven toppings.  I've always had good luck with the quality of lettuce and toppings.  They will offer your choice of steak or chicken to add also.  Turkey can be had on request.  The meats are hit and miss.  I usually just go for the salads sans the meat.

They also have sides like mashed potatoes with a gravy that is really good, and a sandwich bar in which they'll slice fresh turkey or tri-tip and make it into delicious sandwiches.

Logistics of ordering are a little confusing since the salad and sandwich and sides bar have separate lines.  People are unclear on how to behave if you are ordering from multiple locations and whether you have to stand in each line separately.

Overall good food and healthy, too!< /Text>< gmapID>

I eat at Pluto's at least once a week if not more often. There isn't really another place in town where you can get super-customized salads so fast and so fresh. Yeah, you kinda really have to yell to get them to hear your order over the din of the place and sometimes there's quite a line, but I keep coming back for the good salads and steak ❤️< /text>

Food was maybe a 4 but service was lacking. Could’ve just been a one off experience but I don’t plan to return. Just passing through on the way home from Tahoe so they didn’t lose a customer or anything. Hope the lady was just having a bad day or something.< /text>

I asked for my first ingredient and then the server yelled “AND WHAT ELSE?” after each ingredient I said. I then asked if the bread had any eggs in it. The server angrily said she didn’t know because the bread wasn’t made there... (so much for fresh). After I asked her to check, she came out and yelled at me “ALL BREAD HAS EGGS IN IT!” I just looked at her and then walked away. This place is the worst location I’ve been to.

Bread was hard and tables had food crumbs on it.  Otherwise the onion rings were great and lots of veggie options!!</review>

<Text>I love me some Pluto's...as a chef, it's the same kind of food that I like to create. Rustic and homey...warms the soul. There are some things I'd do different here, but the concept is great and I usually have no issue with the food. This is one of my favorite places as autumn gets closer and we get deeper into the season.<//Text>< pictures>

<Rating>3< /Rating><review>I had one of their salads and it was okay. The lettuce was a little wilted and soggy, but other then that it was fine. It was so loud in there that it was hard to talk to the person making my salad, but we worked through it. I liked that there was plenty of parking behind the building. It was also right off the highway which makes it easily accessible to most people.<//review><gmap_id>0x80852972dd12ed59:0x4b91071e9f6de5a< /gmap_id><Response>None<//Response><Time>1377370198294< /Time><username>Julee Mackessy<//username><Pics>None<//Pics></record>

<review>Plutos is just an amazing place to eat at. What really blew my mind the first time that I came here was the way in which you ordered your food. You select from a menu that they have for you in the front and you go from station to station, picking out what you want to eat and they prepare it for you on the spot. They always have different specials each week and if you are a daredevil, then go ahead and pick something random from their weekly specials. Their prices MAY seem a bit too excessive but trust me, they pile food on your plate as if it will be your last meal of your life. Sometimes there is trouble finding a table since it is always packed but it doesn't take off too much of the general atmosphere that it creates. Definitely one of the best places to eat  in Davis, guaranteed.</review><GmapID>0x80852972dd12ed59:0x4b91071e9f6de5a<//GmapID>< date>

Been here once, never been back. Food wasn't great and for the price there are better places, even in Davis. Never even think of this place when considering dinner.< /Text>

Great selection of fresh to order ingredients combined to create the meal of your choice. The different ordering style combined with a typical long line can be a bit overwhelming at first, but the food is worth the wait and learning curve.<//Text>

Been here a few times and everytime I end up feeling like I wasnt treated that well with rude customer service. I'd enjoy coming here a lot more if the staff was a little nicer. I'd be just as happy if not more, getting a prepacked salad from trader joes tbh. But the salad is fresh, and the hot food is okay at best.< /Review>

This place was horrible. The Beef in my sandwich was uneatable- like shoe leather, not exaggerating. I could not eat it. It was so tough it would of had to been eaten with a knife and fork. On top of that it tasted like OLD BEEF. No good, especially for $10 for just the sandwich< /Review>

< Review>
EōS Fitness is honestly the worst gym experience ever. I signed up for short term personal training under the expressed assurance that the gym would accommodate me and my unique situation. I work an international job and was only set to be in the States for a few months.

Therefore, I only needed a few sessions and was told repeatedly that I would only be charged for four sessions by Katie, who signed me up.

I admit that I misunderstood the contract at first, not realizing each session was $148, but after caving, I decided to finish all four sessions. I then asked Katie and her team to cancel my membership and ensure that I would not be charged again. They pulled my name up on their system and reassured me.

This was in March. Fast forward to June, and my account was charged yet AGAIN, even though I have no intention on returning to the gym and I leave the country in two weeks.

EOS has not responded to any of my inquiries, they refuse to give me written confirmation of this cancellation, and overall they have made me feel like a PRISONER to their company.

My bank is in dispute with them currently and one can only hope this repeated issue is resolved. I sincerely hope no one else is put through the emotional anguish I experienced. Please invest your money in another gym, like Planet Fitness. EOS is a greedy corporation.< /Review>

It looks like the payment that processed may have been part of your 30 day notice to cancel but was delayed due to the accounts being frozen during the shutdown.

<Review>Worst gym membership I've ever signed up with!! Their professionalism I found is non existent. Be careful when signing up with them. Be sure to completely understand how to leave membership prior to signing up. I've tried to cancel multiple times and get the run around from corporate. They have to contact the gym and then they'll call me back. I've not received one call back! I call again and start the process all over again. It shouldn't be so complicated right? I was never pleased from the start. The sales is hit hard upon signing up It feels as if it's more of a business than a service to me. That's ok with some I'm sure, it seems that's how the world works these days but it's not how I like to give my business. I'd rather go elsewhere EOS. So disappointed...<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Nothing more exiting than being told you CAN NOT cancel your membership and you're on the hook for a six month contract u didn't know about totaling over $300 a month even though they advertise NO CONTRACTS...But hey, enjoy yourself if u must. Some people enjoy being scammed. If that's you, feel free to sign up! 😉</Text>< Pics>

Relatively cheap membership with lots of equipment. Only 4 stars because it’s pretty much always busy. They push personal training on you when you sign up. The classes that come with second and third levels of membership are great!<//text>

To be fair, I found the staff to be friendly and eager to help.  I hold nothing against this gym in particular, but I do have an issue with the customer service structure.
If you are going to get a membership here just do so knowing that in the event something doesn't work out as planned there is absolutely no one who can assist you.  All policies are set forth by Gold's Gym Corporate...or at least that is what you are told. So then I called the Member Services number given to me.  Member Services implies...well...service.  Come to find out Member Services is merely what they call their billing agency.  A third party with absolutely no authority to take into account individual situations and weigh them on a case by case basis.  At this point I was referred to Gold's Gym Corporate, because they make the rules.  Call Gold's Gym Corporate, and after an exhausting conversation get referred to none other then my local gym because it is a franchise gym, and therefor abides by it's own rules.
By this point I am exhausted, ready to just say screw the entire thing and go with L.A. Fitness.  No contract and they have better extras.
I would beg you to take caution prior to signing an agreement with any Gold's Gym. If anything goes wrong you will spend days just trying to get a hold of some one who can't help.</Text>

<time>1570091653067< /time><Rating>3<//Rating><Text>it's a great gym. Would be better with a bigger pool. Problem here is the membrs, knuckleheads don't rack their plates and if they do it's all helter skelter. No one wipes the equipment and it's overcrowded even early morning and late at night. The gym itself is great, great equipment good ventilation and a decent cardio theater. Their choice of house music is easy listening depressing music though, needs to be more rock and roll to get you moving.  The members however are what ruin this place.< /Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

I know our Parkway facility does have a Jr Olympic pool which we are excited to have available for our members that do swim for their workout.  Additionally,  it is a great pool for our water workout classes.  Members at the club do hit a stride in their workouts and sometimes forget to rerack their weights.  Our team at the club have implemented two team cleans a day where staff will hit the club floor and put away items left behind.  Additionally we have added a floor attendant and also a Facility Manager to assist as well.  I do agree with you about reracking and wiping down equipment and I'm open for suggestion to help make this more of a reality.

< Review>
Being both a member and employee of EoS, I genuinely can say I love this gym. The community, customer service, and overall gym as an industry has evolved beyond what is expected from what a normal gym offers. Temecula Meadows location in specific is my favorite for the support they give both members and their employees to achieve their goals. I love training with Josh, he sees what I don't see in myself, and pushes me to do beyond my best. Being far from a normal gym atmosphere, EoS is invigorating , inviting, and overall excellent. Would not hesitate to recommend this gym and look forward to seeing our community grow!< /Review>

I’m hoping the new location on 79 south doesn’t smell like old sweat when you walk in, but to be fair this used to be a golds gym a few years ago. Also don’t care for the grunting and swearing by other members. Let’s try to keep it classy people!< /Text>

<text>When it is crowed it, it's not as crowded as other gyms.  Every person I have interacted with there as been respectful and corporative.  There is a handful of people that use the gym as a social hour but with plenty of room and benches they have not slowed down me down.  The equipment is top notch and they have a variety of free weights, machines, an open area for calisthenics, etc.  The staff is always helpful and welcoming.  This gym is a no pressure gym where I don't feel like I am being judged or other people aren't not being judged as well.</text>< Pictures>

EOS is a great great gym with awesome trainers,  but often there is equipment that is broken.  Not a lot,  but the ones that are don't seem to be fixed quickly.  The cardio theater is a cool feature but for my tastes isn't loud enough to compensate for all the people running on the treadmills.  They should at least have subtitles.  The gym as a whole is my favorite gym I've been to and I'd recommend it.< /text>

<Review>Ive been going to this gold for over 2 years now and the "general" manager who has been there for "5" years doesn't deserve the job or the title. Ive had two encounters with the lady and both she was very rude, incompetent and not polite at all. The first time i thought oh she must be having a bad day but after this second one realized that, what everyone says about her being the way she is, is true. She doesn't realize that we, the customers, are the reason she has a job that she clearly doesn't deserve. They way she approaches a problem of hers is completely rude and just bitchy in the end. She needs to learn how to approach a problem in a more appropriate manner especially for a "General manager who has been there for 5 years". Now this problem she had was me and my gym partners bags were on the floor. She came up in the middle of my set and said " you need to go put those in a locker now its a liability" so me and my gym parter node and say we will after we finish this set. She proceeds to walk away and tell another gym member the same thing and after she finishes she comes back up to us and says "now before you even hit another set" we ask why and she rudely states "its in your contact" as she walks aways. We listen and during our workout we then see 3 other people with gym bags out and she didn't say anything to them for the rest of their workout. All in all i don't believe she's a good manager and my two experiences with her just shows me she doesn't care about her patrons. She will be the reason i quit gold.< /Review>< Pictures>

Don't go here! Just walk away and save your money! The cleaning crew is often cleaning around equipment blowing dust up as you're trying to do cardio and heavily breathing. Once I was actually tripped by a cleaning persons mob handle while running on the treadmill. Talk about a lawsuit waiting to happen. I even told the front desk and they acted like it wasn't a big deal. Cleaning should be done during off hours. The gym is still dirty all the time. Flies on the ground, hair balls in the treadmill drink holders. Gross. The ceiling was leaking the other day in 3 different locations. The equipment is often broken but doesn't have a sign saying so. The worst though is that you can't scan your own membership card and you have to hand over you keys to the worker to scan. The employees should do their job and watch/man the desk and let the patrons scan their own cards. It's flu season and no one else touches my keys. This spreads disease and is a terrible practice. This gym isn't worth the few dollars a month. I've cancelled my membership and will go elsewhere.<//review>

<Review>The equipment is not kept up to a good standard. It is falling apart before it is repaired. With all the associates that work there the place is a mess. The night shift should clean and put weights and equipment away, but are more interested in getting in their workout, or sleeping. I met Samantha this morning, who was immediately cleaning, put weights and equipment away. She is this little girl. The jocks who work the night shift can't even pick up trash, water bottles, or put jump ropes away.<//Review><UserId.>101681015058888908997<//UserId.><GmapID>0x80db7f26cd5b3969:0x205819638527cff4</GmapID>< Rate>

They pushed a personal trainer on me before I even paid and when I said we could talk about pt another time, the pt manager was clearly irritated and left. They make you pay $39.99 every year to lock in your monthly rates but make that sound voluntary, it’s not...what? They say it’s $20 to join but it $59.00 to join after you pay your mandatory annual lock in your cheep rate fee. Just a way to get more upfront I suppose. I was irritated when I left and felt pushed around and pressured. I left with a bad taste in my mouth and am worried it’s going to be awkward.< /Review><user>101583422546452424400<//user></record>

<pics>None<//pics><text>I went to this gym as a one time guest with a friend who had a membership. I do not even live in California and so I went under what I presumed was a guest pass over a year ago. The card I used to pay for a guest pass was charged monthly for over a year and I spoke with a representative every month to explain that I was not a member. They continued to lie and say that they would cancel the account and then I would contiue to recieve calls stating that they would send me to collections if I didn't pay because my bank reccomended I change my card as I had dissputed the issue with my bank once I realzied that eos was not following through on cancelling my guest pass turned membership. Ultimatley I was lied to and scammed by this company and had to pay a $40 cancellation fee for a "membership" that I had never even signed up for. They went so far as to say that they saw me in the gym at some time in October, (again I do not even live in California I was not at the gym) and threated to send me to collections if I didn't pay the membership cancelation fee. I would NOT recccomend this fruadulent company to anyone.</text>< rate>

<text>Water fountain/equipment  breaks down frequently and stays that way for a few weeks at a time. Gym isn't well kept AT ALL, no one racks their weights and or mats but the staff doesn't bother fix to it. If you want an extremely basic gym with no special requirements then this gym might work for you< /text>< date>

<Rate>3< /Rate><Review>The equipment is soooo run down here.  The benches are loose, the seats are loose, the equipment is all loose and worn out.    Its not uncommon to have a repair tag on stations.  Most of the treadmills would shut down with a check sensor alert.  The gym was fine years ago for what it was, that is a cheap place to workout, but the maintenance and upkeep is poor and then it collectively gets bad.  Good squat racks and friendly desk staff keep the experience ok.</Review>< gmap_id>

Have been a member of this gym since it opened. I love the location because it really close to my house and it's small, which used to be terrible before they opened the one on Temecula Pkwy. But it's really clean, the kids club is awesome, and the staff is generally really great and welcoming.< /Review>

< Review>
While the gym was nice and the classes were good (Go see Vanessa!!) trying to cancel your membership before the four month fee of $39 is a total hassle and you WILL get screwed over. You are TOLD cancelation is easy but just remember to READ because they don't tell you the important things so they can take MORE of your money. So now I was charged $48 (because of my bi-weekly payment) instead of $34 and will be charged AGAIN on the 23rd of August (the people at this golds didn't even tell me that, the woman at corporate did!!)
Basically YOU NEED 31 DAY NOTICE TO CANCEL YOUR STUPID MEMBERSHIP.< /Review>

It's a great value for the price ($9.99/mo); my complaint is the frequency with which the equipment breaks down.  It often takes at least 2 weeks for it to be repaired, even after I complain multiple times.   Also, some employees are unfriendly.

However, the gym itself is kept very clean, there are lots of equipment choices, and the availability 24/7 is great for the low cost.<//Text>

The cardio movie theatre is a cute gimmick for a minute I guess. Its just really freaking annoying to have a gym in this center. THERE IS NO FREAKING PARKING AVAILABLE DURING BUSINESS HOURS. All these poor other businesses have to suffer because the gym people take up all the parking spaces. It was a bad idea to put this gym here. Wish it would go away. Other than that the staff was nice and they seem to keep it pretty clean which many gyms don't. The equipment selection is just okay. It good equipment and they keep it maintained but selection is limited due to the size of he place. I think a better location would have been in that realty building that's always changing hands by Carls Jr on Rancho/Margarita.</Review>< Response>

I went to the Murrieta location to try the free week and management was so high pressure I decided not to go back. The manager tried closing soooo many times after I said no because I wanted to get a feel for the place first. She kept trying to get me to sign up by saying things like I could join now and get a refund if I don’t like the place,  so I told her I wanted to talk to my other half before making a financial commitment, she asked if my wife trusts me to make financial decisions by myself.  She even brought ANOTHER sales member over to tell me about some event and to try and make an appointment with my wife there too.  They texted and called me multiple times within a few days. I was so annoyed by the high pressure sales team I dreaded seeing them in person again. So, why would I join a place like that? Vultures lol< /text>

The younger people working the desk are sometimes rude. Asking them to restart the movie in the media room on multiple occasions was met with indifference , like I was annoying them.

The equipment was good , just did not like the people working there. No place to stretch and do yoga , and the one yoga class I took was the worse yoga class I have ever attended ( not real yoga people)

I cancelled my membership after 1 year , because I couldn't get out of it sooner.< /review>

< Review>
I have an amazing experience everytime I step foot into an eos gym. It doesn’t matter where or who is working. I get a “welcome” when I walk in and a “have a nice day” when I leave. The gym can be an uncomfortable place for some people (like myslef) .The staff, including the personal trainers , always have a smile on their faces and it makes me feel welcome. You walk past personal trainers and you think “oh gosh.. they are judging the way I look” and that could not be farther from the truth! They are genually there to help everyone reach their fitness goal. I have never felt judged or “unworthy” to be in this gym. They offer free advice (which I think we all can appreciate). They offered to take my measurements for free 😄 that was the best part! I could see where I was in my fitness journey! I learned where I want to be and how far I need to go. Normally having someone measure your body is uncomfortable for everyone but it was done with a lot of respect and in a private area so I didn’t feel uncomfortable out infront of the whole gym. They showed me on a piece of paper how I could get to my fitness goal (I got to keep the paper and remind myslef how I’m going to reach my goals) no other gym has taken the time to even get to know my name let alone take my measurements and explain to me “gym stuff”. I give this gym 5 stars because honestly they deserve it. You are doing amazing EOS!</Review>

<text>I got scammed with the personal trainer contract by Jose Deoleo.

I didn't do my research. I came asking for someone to teach me kettlebells, I signed a six month contract with Jose Deoleo the first day I walked into the building. Stupid me.

I didn't know which certifications to ask for. I should have asked for SFG or RKC certification. A one day "introduction to kettlebells for personal trainers" certification is not acceptable, and most trainers didn't even have that.

My first trainer didn't have any kettlebell certification, and quit a month after my contract started. I went through four more trainers. The only trainer that seemed remotely qualified to train kettlebells was unreliable (repeatedly cancelled the day of) and quit one month after I started training with him.

When one trainer cancelled a session I called EOS every day for a week asking why my trainer cancelled and asking for my trainer or for the head trainer to call me. Never got a call back. One day I finally got the head trainer, Jose Deoleo. I learned that my trainer had quit, and no-one told me.

A different potential trainer, at our first meeting, without doing any exercise before,  brought me into the restroom and told me to remove clothing so that he could take measurements and criticize my body composition. That's not cool. That's creepy. I told him that day that I did not want to train with him, but folks, for your own wellbeing, don't let a trainer take you into the restroom.

The head trainer, Jose Deoleo, said that he would hold me to the letter of my contract. No outs for trainers quitting or for me requesting a lofty certification like SFG or RKC, or for trainers being creepy. I had signed a contract.

Jose Deoleo tricked me. I fell for it. Stupid me.

Rotten experience.<//text>< Pictures>

I had the worst experience at this gym, the staff are lazy, they domt pick up theur equipment. Its too small and gets crowded with really young kids trying to lift, i guess because its so cheap they can afford it. They blew up my phone and my husbands with text messages from multiple different numbers trying to get us to get a trainer, i unsubscribed from emails and still recieved them. You cant cancel your membership over the weekend, and no contract my butt. They still make you pay the next month after cancelling. I wasn't there even a month and i got outta there asap. Spend the extra bucks for a membership at a real gym. Oh and in the ladies rest room the toilets didnt work half the time. I was doing an exercise one of my first days there and some trainer posted up their client literally a couple inches behind me... the exercise i was doing is a snatch, which can be dangerous and no one should ever stand behind the person and this "trainer" thought that was safe... smh. Save your money and dont go! I still havent gotten tge money they over charged me back and probably never will...<//Text>

<rate>1< /rate><text>Has gone downhill since the change to Eos. Golds had the team to support its members Eos has very little to offer as far as motivation and helping people succeed. Not to mention it is common than much of the equipment is not functioning as it should. Very disappointed at the loss of Golds. I will be moving on.<//text></record>

<review>Go to costco and get the 24 hour deal. This use to be a decent gym when it was golds. The original golds off of winchester will never be forgotten. Never heard of EOS fitness before  but I can tell you cancelling is a pain in the arse.  Talk to the 1 800 supervisor monju and you will be lucky if she calls you back in a months time.</review>< username>

These people blatantly lied and scammed my husband! We where being charge by weekly for two memberships one with childcare so it was $15 twice a month instead of the regular rate $10 twice a month, which was not the agreement. When my husband started our memberships they explained to him that it was once a month fee for each membership and we could cancel any time.  NOT the case at all! online is states its a $15 cancellation fee unless you have extra privileges with your membership such as childcare then is $25 to cancel. NOT the case at all, after being charged twice a month for our memberships and $25 each for canceling both memberships i called to ask whats going on. They explain I'm not allowed to cancel the memberships before six month and ill continue to be billed by weekly for 30 days or 60 days, I'm not sure which they continue to change there statements. The childcare area was dirty and not very entertaining, My children where not content and the two times I tried to leave them in the childcare they were unhappy and I had to sit with them and after seeing that the toys and floor where still dirty on our second visit I didnt feel comfortable leaving them in the childcare area.< /Review>

This fitness is a SCAM, asking you for bank accounts or credit cards to charge without informing you. Suppose to be no contract however  You need keep paying two months after you cancel the subscription and if you need to downgrade is a $ 30 dollars fee for it. "ITS ALOT FOR NO CONTRACT"<//Text>

The staff is always amazing. The hay quality can not be beat. Their indoor store and everything is worth the 2 hour one way drive we make.  I am so glad we found this gem and they take covid safety seriously which shows they care about their customers.<//review>

<Review>Great experience here.

Beautiful looking hay I'm sure our cows will love.

Friendly staff that went above and beyond to make the experiance seamless and enjoyable.

They provided drinks and candy for the kids and I'll definitely be back.

I would recommend you check them out for yourself as well.

Thanks Tom's, see you again soon!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I've done business with Tom and his crew for at least 20 years. You will not find a more honest and down to earth man. His crew is top notch. Willing to help and load your feed how ever you want it. I'm moving to Arizona and dont know how I'm going to replace Tom's hay farm.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80d9d8edc585562b:0x96fbf62694864b54</Gmap_id></record>

My package came from Florida on March 19 and somehow ended up here at this post office on March 22 2021 and it’s the March 27 2021 at
11:48 am and  I still haven’t received my package Ive been tracking it checking every day  and the tracking says it’s in transit since March 22 2021 what is going on over there must be nice to be getting paid and not do the actual job or work over there and from reading the other reviews here they need to hire better employees here<//text>

This PO is getting worse and worse. I just come to drop off mail and get stamps. Parking lot used to already be small for about 20 cars, now it's smaller to accommodate their mail trucks. It's one way in same way out causing traffic. Oh and they didn't have money orders today, the elders were very mad. And of course the one clerk that was working at the window was irritable.<//Text>

I scheduled an appointment at this post office for my passport. I waited in line just so I can get in even though I scheduled an appointment. Then they tell me that they are not doing passport application there and that I have to go all the to the airport for my appointment this is unacceptable and so disappointing they need to do better an hire more people.<//review>

TO CHARLIE: I HAVE KEPT EACH AND EVERY CHRISTMAS CARD YOU GAVE ME!

I've never seen some many disgruntled and unhappy employees in one place. Even the young women that work there have attitudes. There was one young woman that had a good attitude and good customer service but lately even her attitude had changed for the worse. I'm sure that working for the USPS can be stressful and not all customers are pleasant to deal with but this is the career you chose. I cashiered for 10 years total and when it became to much for me to deal with, I found other employment. I'm sure that the money is good but if you're not providing the best service, then you shouldn't be in a paid position to do so.</Review>

When I needed to fill out something I needed a pen and she said there not letting customers use their pens because of Covid and I need to buy one from the people selling out front. I didn’t  have cash on me so I just gave her back the label and left the other USPS gladly let me borrow their pen. Worst experience at a postal office they need to get rid of rude employees like her their is customers out there that struggle with postal services and it’s sad to see employees like her dismiss people like that.</Text>< UserId.>

Customer service is bad.

I saw one of the clerks on her phone while helping a customer.

When you try to ask for information on lost packages and/or pickup mail the clerk at the window gets mad and starts screaming at the customers for no reason.

The clerk’s are rude and they scream out the information they are supposed to give you. Is hard to understand them at all.

There is always a line and you have to wait a long time to pick up mail and get information about lost packages. The wait is at least 30 minutes on an average day.

This place is always dirty as well.

If I could I would give this place a zero star.</Text>

missing packages, lazy mail carriers and huge turn over rate at thr location I can guarantee long lines, snappy customer service agents and thats just the surface. just avoid using usps if you live in this area served by this post office and don't dump mail here to be sent out better off going to hub on florence and central.< /Text>

<Rating>1</Rating><Text>I wish I asked for their names yesterday. It's a shame how unprofessional this Post Office is. Then you just factor in the community that it's in. This post office is a 100% reflection of the stereotypes that plagues people of color. The employees are below average & the rudeness is overwhelming. It's a shame how they make our people look so bad. They were too lazy to look for my package I told them it was there because it didn't say out for delivery while tracking it. Fast forward to this morning now it's out for delivery it sat there all day yesterday. I'm going to start taking pics & reporting these ghetto employees. Minus 5 stars.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><resp>None</resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2c9d081b9c2ff:0x91f99147268315d< /Gmap_id></record>

This is an excellent facility with Dropbox mailbox to send letters independently and was convenient and my independent and customer service mailing options were available when I just showed up out of the blue. Also is very convenient that they USPS will also pick up mail from your front door if you would like to send out mail. The facility looks very decent and was clean. People were not littering inside the facility and many people had access to mail and to ship mail or packages with no wait line. Tumi so far they're doing great keep up the good work thank you have a nice day. We shall see if the letter arrives were it is supposed to go and when it arrives okay okay.< /Text>

I'd give ZERO stars if I could. Today at 1320 I walked into this post office and I came across the rudest customer service I've experienced so far. Just the way they say "NEXT!" with a nasty attitude and like you're another number let's you know what you might be in for. Then, they sit there and gossip about the customers like it's the thing to do. They rush like they've got more important things to take care of and obviously not the customer.This place seriously needs some discipline or a shut down, or better trainers, maybe a whole new batch of friendly customer commited postal service workers, not people who just want to make money and hate what they do. As soon as one customer left they decided to gossip about him, as I'm standing there. The bullet proof windows are definitely not noise cancelling walls, save that sh××× for your lunch break or after work hours, not in front of every other customer that's standing there. I can only imagine how many customers they gossip about in front of every paying customer they come across, what happened to great customer service? Is there a lack there of in this time and age? Get your priorities straight USPS! Exceptional or close to exceptional customer service to keep customers coming back? No? I've been coming here for quite some time and customer service has definitely changed. Such a shame. UPS/FED EX might be the option for me.<//review>

The most horrible post office I have ever been to. Unprofessional ghetto females and some days you don't get your mail at all. And go into the office smh and you have to deal with the uneducated female staff. That sits on there assess and talk about the customers. It a shame that I live less than a block from this post office but I have to travel to the main post office on Central and Florence  to take care of all my postal needs. Someone with some authority should look into the office on 83 and Vermont and shut it down and rehire people that really want to work and need there job's. This place is full of disgruntled former welfare recipients that's miserable and unhappy and don't want to work.< /Review>

This location is horrible!!! From the mail carriers to all the staff on site including the Supervisors!!! No customer service, very slow, no organization! They lost my package and were unable to locate it when all the tracking indicates USPS Hancock location had it. The Supervisor was unable to give me any details claiming he didn't know. I do not recommend this location!!! I had the worst experience one can ever get at a Postal office!!!</Text>

Worst post office ever, should be closed. Wait, but why? Because the staff. Let me exaplin, they do not help you nor check if everything correct when filling out papers. For example, filling out passport information they said everything right without even glancing at it. Few weeks later I get back packet saying it's missing the signature. And I tell this story on behalf of my mother that struggles. Anyhow, don't take my word for it. Just look over the reviews. The only staff that is loyal, are the mailmans that delivery to our homes. Thank you for reading my experience.<//Text>

Some of the carrier are careless and makes serious errors in delivery packages. I was expecting a small package and obviously was MISDELIVERED to another address. I call the company it came from, and they told me it was delivered on the 27th. Well it did not come to my address. I let them know that I never received it. Whom ever received it was dishonest to keep it.</Review>

<review>This post office SERIOUSLY needs to either get SHUT DOWN or restaffed. The mail sorters are slow meaning mail NEVER gets delivered ON TIME !! The customer service representatives are RUDE and the mail carrier are even MORE rude. Shut this place down or fired EVERY existing worker and restaff immediately.</review>< Pictures>

The energy in this place is appalling.  Like someone said... time to re- staff this location.  Every single person looks like they hate their job. Not friendly at all, with attitude and always gossiping.  **NEGATIVE STARS**<//review>

Currently I am leaving this post office and it is closed. I arrived just prior to 530pm to drop off a check in the mail so that it would be postmarked on the same day. Unfortunately myself and a bunch of other people realized that the office had shut their doors a half hour prior to their normal closing time.
There was a note on the office door apologizing for the inconvience and information about the new office hours. This US Post Office is local to me and has never given me a problem with service until today, hence the 2 star rating.

Google maps also needs to step there game up since they provided incorrect information about the location.<//text>

Mean customer service attendants, panhandlers and minimal parking. Failed to deliver Time Sensitive mail to a P.O. box. Spoke to a representative who explained that they're "understaffed" and "i can't deliver the mail unless it's in my hands". He promised to have his manager follow up with me...i'm still waiting.<//Review>

NEVER EVER review places but first being cut in line by an older woman, then being yelled "NEXT!!!" and finally getting to the window (mind you, im still walking up with a good morning smile after doing a 13 hour shift!!!) and being asked "what do u want!" like damn please quit ur job ladies, I know about 4 people who would do your job with a much more pleasant attitude and thats the 4 homeless people that are outside, how is it that they have a much more kind attitude. People like tht are just a shame and unfortunately possibly need to lose everything to finally be grateful for what they have. Smh! Too early for this kind of disappointment!!!< /Text>

Don't use this post office. They always have a big delay every time you drop off anything for delivery. Whether it be a package or a letter there's always a delay it always ends up shipping two weeks after you drop it off.<//Review>

Been trying to get a package for over two weeks. I never had this problem in Carson.  T he staff members are unprofessional, and they try to explain away any problem.  If my pa kage is here why can't I get it? The mail not being sorted is total ridiculousness it's after ten am at what time does the mail get sorted? Someone needs to do something about this place immediately. I have been trying to get the same package since may 17th it is now may 30th still no package.</Text>

So today 4/14/2017 at 8:30pm the mailman Approach The residence were I live (I live in a 4 house duplex). My neighbor was outside BBQ and I here the mailman tell my neighbor since u r BBQ by the mailbox I'm. Refusing to deliver your mail ,my neighbor told the mailman if it's in your way I can move it....the the mailman had the nerve to snap his fingers at my neighbor and demand him to hurry up....that when my neighbor got upset....I would too how date this person come trying to demand on someone else's property.....first off there was nothing that would cause him any harm or put him in a life threatening situation that would cause him to refuse to drop off our mail.....if he was upset that was his problem and why are u dropping the mail off at 8:30pm ....that's a personal issues if he got delayed. We had a mailman that did this route for 5years if not more the block know him as greeneyes.  I don't know why they changed him but I wish we could get him back....talk about someone with exceptional customer service......this new ignorant mail man can learn a thing or 2 about treating people with common courtesy....I will be filing a formal complaint on Monday because he did not deliver the mail to the whole block he just left....I was waiting for the mail today I have an important documents that I'm waiting for...now I have to wait till Monday know I don't even know if this retarded ass mailman will return to drop off the mail...all I know is that if I start having problems with my mail there will be issues......just because we live on this side of town don't mean we don't know people......I will be going over there heads hey video speaks for itself......<//review>

Very bad customer service, they delivered my package to the wrong place, and when I called then about it they answer the phone as if I was the one who messed up, very disrespectful workers. Someone needs to audit that place. I never did get that package back, and I and still awaiting for the outcome of a case I opened on this matter.< /Review>

This post office is trash. I arranged to have my mail held online, but it kept getting delivered. I called the post office and told them to hold my mail, which they said they would do - but it kept getting delivered. I left a note over my mail box that said to hold my mail, which the postal worker read, then took. Then he delivered my mail anyway, and continues to do so.< /review>

<review>(Translated by Google) This post office has always had a heavy staff, badly faced and without any attitude to serve the public. They should hire people who are worthwhile, who want to earn their salary and who know how to have customer service. I made an appointment for a passport which took me 2 months for a quota and today when the girl arrives yelling at me, she told me there is no one who can help you, I am the only one here, so make another appointment! So what is the appointment system for if they are not going to attend you ?! They are heavy!
Nobody sees these reviews ???? They should be sorry to have a post office with so much complaint.

Esta oficina postal toda la vida tiene un personal pesado, mal encarado y sin  ninguna actitud para atender al publico. Deberían de contratar a personas que valgan la pena, que quieran devengar su sueldo y que sepan como tener servicio al cliente. Hice una cita para pasaporte la cual me tomo 2 meses para un cupo y hoy que llegue la tipa gritándome me dijo no hay nadie quien pueda ayudarte, soy la única aquí, así que haz otra cita! Entonces para que sirve el sistema de citas sino te van atender?!  Son unos pesados!
Nadie ve estos reviews ???? les debería dar pena tener una oficina postal con tanta queja .<//review>< pictures>

(Translated by Google) I do not know why people who do not like to do excellent work are sending to work we had never had this problem with the other person who previously came to leave our correspondence since the quarantine began, we are receiving correspondence from other people who live around my neighborhood And our correspondence, ok, they are leaving it at the address that belongs in my situation, we are going to leave the correspondence to people because they are papers that one expects and they can be important but instead I have lost my correspondence, some never come and others if there are people They come to throw it out of my house and we appreciate that. But it is not our job, it is the job of the person in charge of the postal code 90044 this gentleman postman does not look or does not know how to read because he is changing the correspondence of others, leaving things crazy where they do not have to leave, I need to make a complaint about this person who is coming to leave the mail that does his job well or change it please

Pero no es nuestro trabajo es trabajo de la persona encargada del código postal 90044 este señor cartero no mira o no save leer porq esta cambiando la correspondencia de otros dejando a lo loco las cosas adonde no tienen q dejar por fabor nesecito poner una queja sobre esta persona q esta viniendo adejar el correo que haga bien su trabajo o cambien lo por favor<//text>

(Translated by Google) Jente ratera my mom was the first time she went to be a Sent the box was 5 Pounds. She did not know anything and the abusive old woman sent her Express and charged her $ 76 dollars on Saturday and now she went and was only told that it took her a long time to claim !! If the serrated Sunday Monday holiday had to go today Tuesday but the dapper brown rat like my mother did not understand abuse and did not help her at all😡

(Translated by Google) VERY BAD SERVICE !!! I do not understand why they hire people who do not like their work, otherwise they would not treat us as if they were doing us a favor, I went 4 times in 3 different days to process my passport and of course I left without it. By the way, the time to process it is from 10 to 11, they go an hour to lunch and return from 12 to 1, ridiculous, right? Oh and to finish it depends on the humor of the one who takes care of you, they take you or not the photos. One day he tells you that everything from money orders to photos is done there, and the next day he tells you that you have to bring the photos. Frustrating!!! They don't deserve a star.

(Original)
MUY MAL SERVICO!!! No entiendo porque  contratan a gente que no le gusta su trabajo, de otra manera no nos tratarian como si nos estuvieran haciendo un favor, fui 4 veces en 3 diferentes días a tramitar mi pasaporte y por supuesto salí sin el. Por cierto el horario para tramitarlo es de 10 a 11 se van una hora al lunch y regresan de 12 a 1, ridículo no? Ah y para terminar depende del humor de la que te atiende te toman o no las fotos. Un día te dice que ahí lo hacen todo desde los money órdenes hasta las fotos, y al otro día te dice que tienes que traer tu las fotos. Frustrante!!! No se merecen ni una estrella.<//text>

Justin provided excellent customer service. He was very patient and knowledgeable while helping me choose the perfect AT tires for my Honda Pilot. Their prices are reasonable and they provide life time alignment and tire rotation services. This place was recommended to me by Mike's Auto Service in Mentone, who is a mechanic I trust (kudos to Sam who is a great person and incredible, trustworthy mechanic).</text>

<Text>Sold tires that were three years outdated.  Claimed they had no idea. They wanted me to buy new tires from them, then try to see if they could get the old tires warranted. They should’ve handled their mistake but they didn’t. Lost me as a 20-year-old customer!!< /Text><Rate>1< /Rate><time>1622334158687< /time></record>

<rating>3< /rating><text>Staff were friendly.  But too quick to make a sale, rather than provide quality service.

Ran over an object.  Asked Dinosaur to repair the flat.  They said it was irreparable (fair, sure) because I needed to buy new tires.  I was suspicious because the tread isn't to the wear bars yet.

Went to a big national chain (America's Tire; very strict on tire safety) where I purchased my tires, and while they agreed I'd need new tires soon (in a few months), they happily repaired the flat and sent me on my way -- no charge.

TL;dr -- Dinosaur was too eager to sell me 2 tires.  Rather than giving me a good experience now and selling 4 tires (plus alignment) later.  Because you can be sure, I won't be buying tires from Dinosaur after this experience.<//text>< Pics>

NEVER get an alignment done here, including their other big store.

I've had it done to 2 of my cars, and my father in law has had it done to about 4 of his cars.

Every single time, it's never right. I don't know if they're lazy, or they only do the front, or just let it sit there and hope you won't notice it's the same. Either way, it's never right! I've had it done at numerous places and it's always perfect, but here, it'll always be lacking!

They'll never give you the printout. Probably so you have nothing to hold against them... And if you happen to convince them to give you one, they'll print out a similar car with a super old date on it and hope you don't notice that either.

I recently had 4 new tires put on my car, and while they were nice and even price matched, they once again ripped me off on the alignment. I don't know why I even bother after all the times that they haven't gotten it right!

Probably just going to have to take the loss of money because I'm sure they won't refund me and I'm sure they won't fix it right (they never do), so oh well. Sucks to be them because I have 2 more cars that need all brand new tires but I'll be going elsewhere.</review>

< Review>
The guys there were nice, helped us right away. But the only thing that was annoying is that my fiance called ahead of time to make sure they had our specific tire. They said they had it. We went and they said they didn't have it. They should be more mindful of that, it's hard get out with a baby.</Review>

<Rating>4< /Rating><review>Recently came for a jazz concert and guitarist Carlos Santi. Both times we sat near the back. The jazz concert was very nice, good musicians and was very enjoyable. Carlos Santi is supremely talented. I like the intimacy of the Hall, it's not too big. Seats are comfortable. The lack of 5 stars is due to some of the employees being a bit rude.</review>< pics>

Came here for a Nuts & Bolts training ran by ASI and the University. The room was great, and the presentation was great. If you are going to attend for a musical performance you definitely won't regret coming. It's clean and ample space.</Review>

I had an appointment with Veronica,  nail technician.  It was my first time at the salon and getting work by her. She was very nice and professional. My nails were done just how I'd envisioned them and they were very well made. This is the first time I will actually recommend a nail technician. She really did a great job. I'll be coming back for sure.< /Text>

<Text>Ms. Peaches burned my hair out. My hair was growing. It reached about 2 inches. When I left the salon I had a bald spot.  There was no apology.  She styled it so I wold notice the bald spot.  I called her to see if she would offer a remedy, but she didn’t a  BB seer, nor did she return my phone call.  When I call for appoints she always return my call, but since she burned my hair out, she won’t return my call.  Very poor customer service.  I understand mistakes happen, but when a big mistake like this happen she should have at least offered to help repair my hair at no cost.  I was vert disappointed.  I will never go to Peaches again.<//Text>< Pics>

I've have had my hair cut and highlighted by Jaime for three years , and she is just awesome.  I have short, fine and thin hair, and she always amazes me when I see my hair style in the mirror.  It's a fun and carefree, and a look that I love!<//review>

Robert was amazing and gave me a beautiful haircut. I'd actually gone years without cutting my hair and he really listened to what I wanted, and worked with expert precision. He was professional, kind, and definitely knew what he was doing. I am very happy with my new style and will be coming back for sure. Thank you!< /Text>

Darlene is awesome! I have gone to her several times and I am always very pleased with my hair. Last time I was there, she did a short A line and added some color. The A line was perfect. I received many many compliments on it. I will be going back tomorrow for a new color and a trim. I know it will be just as good!< /text>

<username>Basic Feed< /username><date>1508438298175</date><Rate>1<//Rate><review>Poor management & salon as a whole - HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED:

1) I called the receptionist to schedule an appointment with a really good stylist - ASKING SEVERAL TIMES TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS A GREAT STYLIST FOR MEN.
2) Jamie did not follow instructions at all. She was rough, did a half ass job on the side trimming, and left a crooked neckline. Then she totally damaged my natural hairline with a ridiculous/dramatic edging. At that point, I got out of the chair and told the receptionist I needed a new stylist.
3) Jamie then confronted me at the counter, telling me "This is what brothers get" when I am a white man and not black. Very inappropriate.
4) I went outside while waiting for a new stylist and Jamie confronted me outside AGAIN. Telling me I needed to pay her for the half-job she did (keep in mind hair cut was not finished at this point). Jamie asked me if I was on drugs because I was upset. Very inappropriate.
5) A new stylist did his best to fix this disaster of a hair cut, while Jamie went around talking to other stylists and making a scene. As if she was in the right.
6) Then I noticed that a small part of my eyebrow had been cut by Jamie. The new stylist also noticed that the trimming on the sides was not complete and the neckline was crooked.
7) I spoke with the owner, who had no intentions of firing this unprofessional stylist because "they're hard to find". So with that said, this salon is a joke and you should look at the other reviews. The owner makes poor judgement calls with who she hires and manages.

TAKE YOUR BUSINESS SOMEWHERE MORE PROFESSIONAL! THIS PLACE IS A JOKE AND NOW I HAVE THIS RIDICULOUS HAIR CUT AND EYEBROW TO LIVE WITH FOR A FEW WEEKS. ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS! READ THE REVIEWS ON OTHER SITES!</review>< Pictures>

<Rating>5<//Rating><Review>Reflection Salon is AWSOME!!  All the staff are super nice and professional.
For perms/relaxers make an appointment with JOVONNE, she is a master at her craft, SHE KNOWS HOW TO DO BLACK HAIR. I’ve been going to her eight years now. My hair before, was a mess  and unhealthy, and  very short like barely shoulder length, and since then my hair has grown so much it’s now to my elbows when straightened  =) =) I’m so happy with my hair now. For the first time in my life I LOVE MY HAIR.
Sincerely,  Zaneta</Review>< pics>

When I tried to get a more specific answer, I was told that different stylists charge different amounts.
I don't know much about the nail / salon business, but my wife, who is from New York, knows just about everything. She explained to me that this salon apparently practices a "charge by the book-cover" pricing policy.
I know what that means. For those who don't, it means that if you look like money, you are charged appropriately. It also means that if the buyer happens to be of a background the seller doesn't like, the buyer is charged a race-fee.
The FBI refers to this criminal act as "Price Gouging," and it is a felony.

<review>I had a very bad experience with ANGELICA when she colored and cut my hair. My hi-lite looked like an overall color and my hair cut looked like chunks of hair were picked up and just cut. Some hair was 2 inches longer than strands of hair next to it. I had never seen anything like it. She did recut my hair however it was the same just shorter. I should have known something was still going bad with the 2nd cut as someone watching her asked if she needed help. After our 5 week vacation in Fresno I returned to home to my regular stylist and she thought my 5 year old granddaughter cut me hair. That is what it reminder her of. Trust me avoid ANGELICA This is a bad reflection of the salon even thought they contract their hairdressers.</review>< pictures>

<user_name>HappyPositiveCherrie</user_name><Time>1499382411002< /Time><Rating>1< /Rating><Text>My god...I have never had such an awful manicure experience in my life.
I got my nails done on short notice but still made an appointment before hand with a lady I was unfamiliar with here. I forgot her name but just remember she has wide hips. The entire time she spent complaining to me about her life, her family, her nephews and literally everyone, even clients she has had in the past, like I was some sort of therapist. Like lady I got my own problems, I don't care. The manicure it self took longer than it needed to and one of the things that was offered on the website was not available. My nails looked awful, smudged and not worth the time and earful this lady gave me. I don't get a chance to treat myself to often, so I thought it would be something nice, it was a disaster. I felt like leaving half way tbh but knew I didn't have the means to remove the pieces she had already put on at the moment. She complained how my manicure was taking her extra time and how she didn't like some clients and they swear like crazy here. I CANNOT by any means speak for anyone else who works here but if you get the lady with the wide hips...run and don't look back, or schedule with someone else or somewhere else. I was still kind enough to leave her a 20 dollar tip despite the attrocity I had to endure. Ugh yuck I'm not ever going back here. Absolute nightmare.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>Phenomenal time! I am not a beginner surfer and was looking to fine tune some skills and learn some new ones. I also ended up getting the photo package. The whole session was worth every penny. Good photos and I did pick up a few good pointers to improve my surf. You could tell sharing the stoke with the beginner surfers and the experienced surfers was all Marty's passion. Marjan took some great photographs and the communication with the team throughout booking and experience was great. I was only in town for one day, but will definitely be back. Attached are some of the photos from they took.</Review><rating>5</rating>< resp>

Brandon and the whole team was great! I would recommend to anyone looking to surf. Brandon took the time to make sure I was safe, and patiently and carefully taught me, and I stood up  at the end of the lesson! I had a blast! Definitely plan to go back on my next California trip!<//text>

I had to rearrange a couple of times due to work commitments and the process was super easy.  On the day the whole team were friendly and laid back but professional.  My husband really enjoyed the lesson and as we are new to Los Angeles it was a great way for him to find out local information about the best spots to surf and to dust off the cobwebs.  He picked up some good technique tips and is feeling sore today, in a good way! Would highly recommend for beginners as well as intermediates wanting to get back into surfing< /review>< Pictures>

<Resp>None</Resp><Text>I've taken surf lessons in multiple cities from multiple groups and Kapowui was by far the best.

We went over all the foundations from what part of the surfboard is what, and how to stand on it/turn to mastering each part of the pop up before getting into the water. Then, when we did, surfing was much easier for me than ever and it felt like second nature.

The staff is also so friendly that even people on the beach who weren't taking a lesson with them and asked them questions got answers and they couldn't have been happier to help.

Would never take another lesson anywhere else. It was fun, I learned a lot, and feel way more comfortable on a surf board. Don't forget to add their photographer to your lesson - she takes amazing pics! A++< /Text>< rate>

We had an amazing surf lesson with Kapowui! Eduardo, our surf instructor was the BEST! He made our group feel extremely comfortable and confident and we were all able to get up with his guidance. I highly recommend booking surf lessons with this company  :)</review>

<Review>Excellent experience for our son for his first ever lesson. Everything was spot on from the email updates and where to find Kapowui at the beach. Made it easy. Claudio was a fantastic instructor and our son was up on the board with his first attempt. He does have a lot of other boarding experience which helped but Claudio spent time before going in the water to make sure he explained the basics.  Claudio spent the entire time in the water without his board instructing, helping to catch waves and be a terrific teacher. The staff was welcoming and ran a great experience from start to finish. I also appreciated that the other guy who was in our lesson showed up 30 mins late, and they didn’t make our son wait for that guy to “catch up”. Highly recommend!< /Review>< Pics>

<Review>I took my first surf lessons with Edwardo and I am hooked on surf. Edwardo is a phenomenal instructor and experienced surfer (34 years!). He was very thorough in explaining the fundamentals and also payed very close attention to my movements so that he could correct my positions. I saw progress within two lessons and cannot wait to come back for more. The owner Martin is such a great guy and went out of his way to make sure that I was satisfied with my experience.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None<//Response><GmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

I can't say enough wonderful things about our experience with Kapowui. From our initial booking, Martin was super helpful in finding the best time for our daughters based on their ages and the tide. We had clear instructions on where to go, including tips on beating traffic and parking. Edwardo was our instructor who felt like a fun uncle to our girls and gave everyone in our party of 5 plenty of attention. Martin made us feel so comfortable and part of the squad, our girls had such a blast we rented gear from them the next day and surfed the entire day. Highly recommend!!< /Text>

<text>My friends and I were in town for a week and our 5 kids (ages 9 - 15) were dying for a lesson.  They took 2 group private lessons with Eduardo who was fantastic.  He is clear, cares about safety and makes it fun!  They were all standing on their boards by the end, it was amazing — and they all can’t wait to get back to surf!  Highly recommend!!< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

I just had my first lesson with Eduardo and it was so much fun!!! Eduardo was extremely patient and gave gentle suggestions and tips to make the most out of our lesson. Also, as a larger sized woman, I was worried about how inclusive surfing was but Kapowui was great, they had a wide range of wetsuits and Eduardo definitely was in tune with our needs. We will definitely book again very soon!</Text>

Called and asked about the weather, they made a suggestion and went with it. I was with Clay, he was absolutely fantastic, got me up more than enough times to enjoy the waves and surfing experience. He put in a lot of effort to ensure that I had a great time. 5’10 200+ pound dude here and clay made sure I had a great time. If I can do it so can you! 5star rating for clay! Ask for him and tip him well! ❤️</text>

My surf lesson with Eduardo was fabulous.  Such a nice and patient guy, he spared no energy in demonstrating “pop up’s” on the beach, and then put me into some good waves.   Being a surf instructor appears to be a tremendous exertion, but Eduardo kept guiding and pushing my board, advising and generally placing me into the best position to learn lots and have fun.  He also conveyed something of the convivial and communal ethos of the beach and the school, taking time to tell me about the other surfers and their life stories.   Kapowui was a delightful introduction into the mysterious rituals of surfing.<//Review>

My group of three had an amazing time taking our first surf lesson with Clay at Kapowui! We messed up the dates and were 30 minutes late, but the staff was friendly and accommodating, and we were in the water with no rush fifteen minutes later, and were able to keep surfing blast the original end time. We all rode waves by the end of the lesson thanks to Clay’s laid back and attentive teaching! Clay is a great teacher and the perfect surfing mentor to help new surfers learn how to surf. We will definitely be back.< /Text>

I paid for a 2 hr surf lesson with Todd and I gotta say I had an awesome experience for it being my first time surfing. Todd made sure to explain everything to me clearly and with a true teacher’s spirit. I feel like the adjustments he had me do in the water after noticing my tendencies helped me a lot in actually riding the wave as well as helped my confidence on my next attempts. Overall, the whole crew that greeted me were great people, sociable, and laid back. (And I loved their cocker spaniel). I would definitely pay for more lessons in the future if I get the chance.<//review>

I had a fantastic time during my surf lesson with Tyler. He kept the mood loose but also taught us everything we’d need to know to be able to catch some waves. I was even riding some on my own by the end. 10/10, if you’re looking to learn this is the spot<//review>

My sister and I had so much fun learning how to surf. Our instructor was patient and kind. He used humor throughout the lesson. We did not have the best waves and was a bit windy. We love the quality of the lesson with a price that is reasonable. Santa Monica is a great place to learn.<//review>

My son had been wanting to do surfing lessons for quite some time and we were finally able to fly out of Houston and head to California for him to enjoy some beach time. Todd and Claudio were great instructors and really took the time to make sure my son, who is only 9, felt comfortable with the movements and made sure that it was a good birthday experience for him. Even when my son got frustrated trying to get the movements down in the sand, they continued to work with him until he got it right. His first time riding the waves, he stood up on his surfboard and rode it all the way to the shore! Their energy and positivity was great and you can tell that with all of the employees, helping people have the best surfing experience possible really is their passion. The only part I was bummed about was the purchase of the GOPRO. Once we received the SD cards, the files were corrupted, BUT when I brought this to the owners attention he immediately offered a number of solutions and gave me a refund for the hassle. The next time I am in California I am definitely going to book with them again!</text>

<text>I walked up to Martin's van, without prior appointment, and was immediately able to rent a board. I told him that I was a total beginner and I wanted to get thrashed by the waves without any tutoring. He gave me the most important pointers about safety, then he let me go surfing. I really liked his attitude,  he did not berate me for not taking a lesson and that was awesome. Of course I wasn't able to stand on the board at all, but I had my fun and Martin was very kind to point out some possible errors once I asked him why the boards nose would dip into the water all the time. I will come back and try surfing without a tutor again. At one point I will get a course to beat all my self trained errors out of me though.</text><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

Everything was amazing from start to finish. Claudio was the best hype man/instructor and taught us a thing or two about ripping waves—so much so, we caught 10 of our own (each). Great vibes all the way around, we’ll be back!< /review>

Best experience ever. I took a lesson with JC, and he is one of the coolest people I’ve met. He was so enthusiastic, positive, and thoughtful. He made me feel proud of myself during the lesson and i am now in love with surfing. He was very courteous about covid—he gets tested every week and he asked multiple times if we were okay with being in close contact during the part of the lesson that is in the water (which is kind of required for a beginner surf lesson). He spent a perfect amount of time demonstrating basic mechanics before we got into the water so that we would know what to do. As per the company itself, they were super kind and accommodating, and they gave us full-length, rinsed and dry wetsuits (which was something that another company didn’t do, which was very uncomfortable). They also rent suits and boards if you want to keep surfing after the lesson. SUCH a great experience, and i already scheduled another lesson for next week. 11/10 recommend!!!<//Text>

I had such an amazing time with Kapowui! This was my first ever surfing class and my instructor Claudio made me feel super safe and I actually felt like I know what Im doing as he was able to prepare me well before I hit the ocean. I can't wait to book my next class! Recommend this place to anyone wanting to learn how to surf and actually have fun with it!<//Review>

Ed was an amazing instructor and made my first time surfing ever so rewarding! He was very informative, receptive to all my questions and was refreshingly comforting whenever I felt a little nervous. I caught a handful of good waves for my first time thanks to Ed! I felt safe and well looked after. He was so encouraging the whole session and me feel amazing about my decision. Thank you Kapowui for making my surfing dreams come true! Hope to catch you guys out there 🤙🏽🤙🏽<//review>

I've taken 3 lessons with Kapowui so far (once with Liam and twice with Todd) and my surfing experience has been super awesome every time. The instructors have a lot of knowledge to share about the waves and how to surf. I had a great time in the water with them and they give feedback on every attempted wave which really helped to remind me what to focus on. I asked tons of questions to help me visualize and understand the wave science and they had answers for all of them which was super helpful. I would definitely recommend Kapowui over other schools that were just kinda "meh" in my opinion.</text>

They run a very smooth and efficient operation with an incredibly friendly and knowledable staff. This was my friend and I's very first time getting on a surf board and our instructor really broke everything down to make it simple to understand. Definitely a little nervewracking at first, but SO MUCH FUN and SO WORTH IT! Didn't expect to be so sore afterwards, but we have a new hobby that we can't wait to continue to do this summer! Thank you guys so much!!< /text>

I had a fantastic time with Ed (THANK YOU!).

He helped me mentally relax and just enjoy the process and have fun, - because this is why we want to surf and stress won't lead us anywhere. He was very specific at explaining and correcting my mistakes and equipping me with valuable advices to help me get better at surfing day-by-day, wave-by-wave.

Looking forward to more classes!</text>

Marjan made sure I got the best price deal I could get and she went out of her way to do so! Todd was such an amazing and informational instructor I left him a tip! (which is not required) but it goes to show how helpful, patient, and full of great energy he was! I purchased the go-pro to have clipped onto my surfboard. You will need a card reader to watch your shots but I'm excited to have actual footage. I even managed to catch more than 4 or 5 waves which, for a beginner, is freaking awesome! I learned how to paddle as well. I'm from North Carolina but whenever I visit I Will certainly be coming again and again! - E !<//text><user_id>108222102779295266671</user_id>< date>

As the day of lesson drew closer, Kapowui did a great job sending up follow up email reminders of where to meet, and who my instructor would be. The meet up instructions were spot on, and they had everything ready for me. I just needed to arrive with my swim shorts. My instructor Edwardo made the instructions very clear, and was very patient. Thanks to his practical drills before we got in the water, and his continued encouragement, I caught the wave on the first attempt. The price for a 2 hour lesson was extremely fair. I WILL be using them again, and encourage everyone to go with Kapowui for lessons.</Text><Date>1603234150946<//Date><rating>5<//rating><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None<//response><user>112758266596565356220< /user><Name>Jason Cole</Name></record>

If you are looking for a surf lesson, this is definitely the way to go. I had an amazing experience. The staff are extremely kind and are with you the whole time throughout the lesson. I got up my first time on the water. I wanted to learn how to surf for my birthday and I am so glad I came here.  They even sang happy birthday to me in two languages. I am definitely returning for more lessons in the future. I can't imagine a better way to learn.< /Text>

Wow, what a fun and great experience!! I recently moved to California from Michigan and the only thing I wanted to do as soon as possible was to go surfing! I had never been surfing so I was extra excited. I had a 1 on 1 lesson with Eduardo and it was the highlight of my time since being in California. Eduardo is very knowledgeable, practiced great safety measures, caring, and overall just a really fun time! Everything from the beginning of the lesson, including the crew at the van, did not disappoint with the positive vibes. Highly recommend and will for sure visit again when I’m in the area!< /text>

This was an amazing experience.  Highly recommend to any family wanting to learn together.  Ask for Todd and do the 1.5 hours.  Todd was a fantastic instructor and all six of us were standing on the board riding waves by the end of the lesson.  Can not recommend it enough!<//text>

Martin is an actual legend!!!! This was a great experience, and super convenient. Martin, our instructor, was kind, patient and was really invested in our time out in the water. He was also super respectful of our space and comfortable with keeping masks on whilst we were having the land portion of the lesson. Totally recommend him and Kapowui, definitely coming back for another lesson<//review>

<review>Definitely recommend this surf school whether trying it out for fun or wanting to get more in to surfing.

Alex was my trainer and he was incredibly professional and knowledgeable. He went through all the basics to build a really strong foundation to learn how to surf.

Setting up the lesson couldn’t have been easier and they are really on the ball with everything and make it a really great experience. Will definitely be going back for more lessons.<//review>< pictures>

I highly recommend Kapowui! We started taking our teens there this summer and it's been amazing! Most instructors are life long surfers, very knowledgeable, and super friendly. For beginners and beyond there is alway something to be learned. It's fun for small groups of 2-4 and 1 on 1 instruction. The iconic VW bus piled high with surfboards says it all and Marjan is all things operations and a dream to work with.< /Review>

My buddy took me to surf some waves on my birthday today! Best experience I’ve had being my first time being on a surf board. Todd and Tai were great instructors. They were extremely patient and full of energy (That alone made the experience that MUCH better). For anyone looking to get some waves in, definitely suggest you guys reach out !</Review>

With my recent move to the West coast, I was super excited to try out surfing! Kapowui had great reviews and had a really easy online booking service so I went with them. I had the two hour session with some friends and they went over the basics and safety precautions before we got out to the water. Edwardo was a super fun instructor and he did a great job of helping us get up on the boards during our first lesson! Boards and gear were all provided! Would definitely come back for future lessons!<//review>

<review>My kids (10 year old girl, 14 year old boy) had an awesome first lesson here with Eduardo and Ty. The on-the-beach session was concise and complete and gave the kids enough info to ride successfully in the water. Both instructors were super cool and supportive and got the kids into too many waves to count during the session. They made the kids' first lesson great and the kids are asking when they can go again. Thanks, Kapowui!</review>< Name>

< Review>
Cool, laid back people and easy location to get to. I went Sat morning, no stress with traffic or parking. Moved here from Chicago but I was always intimidated with the ocean and steep learning curve compared to skateboarding and snowboarding so I didn’t know what to expect.  Connor gave me clear instructions on the beach. In the water, I did what he told me and was able to pop up with him pushing me into the waves, then me paddling into them. I was able to catch so many waves during my 2 hr lesson I was exhausted. I feel he gave me enough tools to try on my own next time but would to take another lesson if needed. Can’t wait to get back out there, highly recommended, thanks guys!</Review>

I chose Kapowui based on all the 5 star reviews and now I have to give them 5 more stars! We really enjoyed our lesson. It was easy to find the van and there was lots of parking available. Instructor Clay made sure we had the mechanics down on the beach and then helped us get going in the water, telling us when to go. Neither one of us was any good at it, but he was very patient with us. We were first-timers and had no idea how exhausting and hard surfing is, but we had so much fun! I really give it a 10/5 and I 100% plan to take a lesson with them again next time I'm in the area!< /Review>

All instructors are very professional. You can definitely get how to surf during the first lesson.
I am so happy I got Eduardo who taught me how to surf. After a package of 5 lessons I can catch the ways on my own. But be patient, you will fall and that’s okay, nothing is easy. Professionals fall all the time too. That’s okay to spend one hour in the water and catch 1-3 waves, it’s definitely worth it.

Thanks guys, I felt in love with surfing.

My kids (12 and 15) and their cousins (13 and 16) took a two hour lesson from Conner and Todd.  Three of the teens were still beginners, having had only a couple lessons in the past.  They spent 30-40 minutes getting gear and then walking through the surf steps on the beach before getting in the water.  They had a blast - all managed to ride some waves, being pushed into wave by the instructor.  Were having so much fun they asked to stay for an extra hour (which we did).  More experienced teen rode waves with Conner for a couple hours and got good tips on how to improve and read the break.  Great communication with Martin (on site leader) and Marjan (phone & email ahead of time).  Easy location to find, tons of gear to use.  In fact, kids were able to try different boards, to see which ones were easier based on their size and balance.  Would highly recommend!  Maholo!</Text>

My friend and I did a lesson together with Tyler. It was so much fun! Tyler was totally professional and made safety and fun a priority. He was always encouraging and knew exactly which waves would suit us best. All safety protocols were in place and we were instructed in them very well. There was good communication. I received an email confirmation, a text confirmation, and text reminder. Overall, a fantastic experience and well worth the price.</review>

<Review>I had so much fun surfing today! Tyler is a great and supportive instructor. I still can't believe I was able to ride multiple waves and stand on my board all the way to shore thanks to Tyler's instruction. Make sure to book photography with Marjan, as she did a great job and took amazing shots! Everything went smoothly from booking the lesson to surfing day and receiving all the great surf photos on the same day. Can't wait to book my next lesson with Kapowui<//Review>< pics>

<Text>Kapowui Surf Lessons is the best surf school in California. Learning to surf has been a life long dream of mine and Kapowui did such an awesome job. They truly care about the health and safety of their customers as well as making sure everyone has a great time. Corey Biggs is an amazing instructor and got me standing up on my very first wave. I highly, highly recommend Corey and Kapowui to anyone looking to surf.< /Text><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

Received a surf lesson as a birthday gift from my husband during our trip to California and it was awesome! It was our first time trying surfing ever and Edwardo (our instructor) made the experience fun and his instruction was on point! We were catching waves as soon as we got into the water! Highly recommend Kapowui Surfing School! We’ll definitely get coming back on our next visit!<//Text>

This whole experience exceeded my expectations! I came into my lesson with zero experience and by the end I was surfing! They spent the first half hour teaching you the technique which really helped get me comfortable. I ended up having so much fun and left with a great sense of accomplishment. Would definitely love to return for more lessons!<//text>

This place is the best! If you’re looking to learn the right way to surf consistently, this is the way to go. Eduardo has been very helpful in teaching not only to get on the board but the very helpful tips and tricks on doing it right if you were on your own. I’ve been to another surf shop to learn and it’s a night and day difference. Stop by here if you want to actually learn how to surf!!</Review>

Awesome experience surfing in Santa Monica. The crew was very professional as friendly from the time we got to the Kapowui Surf Van and evening after our lesson was done. Conner was an amazing instructor. Helped our group of four catch a ton of waves. Recommend the two hour session, can’t go wrong! Will definitely be back soon.</Review>

<review>I cannot say how great of an experience I had! I have never been to California before, much less been surfing! I had Eduardo as my instructor, and he couldn’t have been more helpful, encouraging, or hilarious! I love that the lessons are very personable (we only had two people in my group), so everyone got the right amount of attention. 30 minutes into the lesson I was standing up surfing! I even started to try more advanced movements. I would highly recommend this company for anyone interested, whether experienced or not!< /review>< pics>

<Rating>5< /Rating><text>I had an amazing session with Edwardo as my first ever surfing lesson. He was patient and skillful, watching for the appropriate wave for me to try standing on. I was standing on the board for the majority of the lesson, which was a lot of fun. He was very amenable to my ambtiousness to try different depth of water, and knew how to read the waves. I highly recommend Edwardo as he has had over 30+ years of experience and was very easy for me to get along!<//text>< pics>

<Review>Had a lesson here. Immediately realized I need to buy the 3 pack.
They had me on the board on the very first lesson. This is my second time and I have already progressed to the pop up.
Corey is the man. He is intense in the best possible way. Shout out to you my man!< /Review>< pictures>

I had my first lesson with Hayley, and I couldn’t have asked for a more supportive, understanding, and knowledgeable instructor!!!! I was definitely scared, but she worked with my comfort level, while pushing and empowering me at the same time. This one lesson alone with her has given me confidence that I can achieve my dreams of surfing. She took the time to get to know me and formulated a personalized plan suited to my needs and goals. I am definitely taking more lessons with her, and know that with her help, I will achieve my goals.< /review>

<Review>Fantastic company and wonderful experience. Ruben was the man. Wife and I had a private lesson with him and he was kind, entertaining, and a patient instructor. His instructions were so good that we both were standing on the second attempt after never surfing before!

<Review>I could not say anything but the best about how amazing and professional their lessons are. I had Alex as an instructor, and not only did he give me constructive feedback, but he also went above and beyond to make sure I felt comfortable and at peace in the water, and I was up and riding within a couple waves! I will be back next time I’m in SoCal for more advanced lessons.. hopefully I can go shred with all the peeps at Kapowui when I’m good enough, lol!  Highlight of my vacation.<//Review>< UserId.>

<rate>5< /rate><text>Amazing place to learn how to surf for beginners and intermediate surfers! I got Tyler as my instructor and he was awesome! He is a true Californian surfer like from the movie. He knows his stuff and can teach anybody. The location is perfect to learn and improve your skills as there are small and large waves. Don’t look further. Start surfing here!!!< /text>< Pictures>

<userid>102178264695958531376<//userid><text>I took my 7-yr old daughter out with Kapowui and was very happy with our experience. Our instructor Mark was a great teacher, he offered me feedback throughout; and when my daughter struggled to stand, he kept her safely out on her board in the waves as she laid down enjoying the ocean, while pushing me to learn more. As we left, I met the owner Martin and felt very confident in how seriously he takes his work, understanding the value of the money we pay and wanting to make sure everyone has a quality experience. Mark was awesome, our photographer was there to catch every moment, and it was a pleasure to meet all of you! You guys are great and we'll see you again soon. xoxo<//text><gmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /gmapID></record>

We had a perfect overall experience with Kapowui for our 2 person lesson this weekend. The directions for arrival were clear and when we arrived at 6:20 they were already there, ready to go, so we got started right away. I’m a total first timer and our instructor Liam was fantastic. His instruction on the beach was interesting and helpful, and then once we got in the water he was like a surf instructor guardian angel 😂 The waves were a bit rough and coming in really quickly after each other so getting out through them was challenging, but Liam basically pushed us through them when we needed it to help us get to where the waves were breaking and make sure we didnt get too exhausted to have fun. And we did have so much fun. He pushed us off into good waves and told us when to pop up, then later helped us figure out what to do differently if we had fallen the last time. The amount of work your instructor does out in the water for you is insane so trust me this is not overpriced. (Don’t forget to tip!) Definitely want to go again.</text>

We booked surf lessons with Kapowui and from the very start they made sure we were accommodated and happy. I had a pretty large party including some kiddos. Every single instructor and the owner made sure we were taken care of. They were friendly and relatable. And made sure EVERYONE was looked after. They were knowledgeable and encouraging. I recommend them for all skill sets. They even made some of our party who couldn’t swim feel comfortable which resulted in them catching a wave. The owner is the nicest man. He was honest and caring. You can tell he really is in it for the passion & not just money. If you’re in LA I definitely recommend Kapowui.<//review>

What an Awesome experience!!! My boyfriend and I went to Cali on our anniversary trip a few days ago and he had a blast with the surf lessons. He was able to knock "learn to surf" off his bucket list. The instructors are great. You definitely can tell they eat, breathe  and sleep surfing. They also had a wonderful photographer, Marjan. She definitely captured some amazing moments. Thanks to the whole team for the ENERGY!!!!! To more success!< /Review>

Eduardo is such an amazing instructor !! He was really professional, chill , and also made us feel very comfortable. He was patient enough explain to us step by step on how get on the board, and went back and forth to push us to get on the wave. We had a great time with Kapowui. This is the place to go if you wanna get the authentic California surfing experience. It’s right by the Venice beach and look for the cute orange Van with surf boards on it 🏖🚌</review>

I received lessons from a wonderful instructor named HAYLEY (who I would highly recommend), a very durable surf board, a lightweight wet suit and was pleased with my service.

<review>Our group was set up with an instructor named Alex. We were lent the needed equipment to succeed. He thoroughly broke down the proper techniques needed to maneuver, prop up, and ride the waves for beginners with no prior experience. He made the process super straightforward and fun to learn. Super dope and chill vibes, plus a great value. 5/5</review>< pictures>

<review>I took an early am lesson with Hailee and I had the best time! She was so professional, fun, and relatable. I surfed intermittently a decade ago but was never very good. After my 90 minute lesson, I was able to pop up and ride a wave on my own again. I had a blast! I could not recommend a better company to take a lesson with! Book with Kapowui; you won’t regret it!< /review>< pictures>

<user>115012784794420372993<//user><Text>Kapowui are extremely professional and I can't recommend them highly enough. I signed up for an individual 1.5 hour lesson and indicated that I was open to having more people added to my group. Another student was added who paid for 2 hours, so the instructors let me have an extra half hour for the price of 1.5. I was also lucky to have two instructors (Mark and Luke, who were both clearly qualified and enthusiastic surfers and teachers). There was a lot of focus on appropriate technique during the land and water portions of the lesson. Even after successfully catching multiple waves, I received a lots of feedback on how to improve my stance and control. After the lesson, I was able to purchase my (used) wetsuit for a really affordable price. I'll definitely be a regular!< /Text>< Time>

Awesome private beginner lesson for our family of 5 adults. Todd was such a great instructor. Marjon made the booking really easy. Super friendly staff! Todd went through all the steps easily, and we all stood up throughout the lesson. Would definitely go with Kapowui again! Thanks guys!< /review>

Went for a private beginner lesson. The instructor was so patient on a day the waves were really rough and not beginner friendly. I had been to previous lessons before at other places but the technique I learnt here made more sense and I made a lot of progress. Will be going again.</review>

Martin was an amazing instructor and helped me pick up the basic skills quickly. His vibes were perfectly encouraging to get me standing quickly. And their customer service provided us a great last minute decision to take a lesson. Amazing experience.</Review>

<review>Best Intro to surfing around! Eduardo & Todd were super professional, knowledgeable, and fun to work with. First thirty minutes is in the sand going over the steps to get up on your board, then it’s an hour and a half of riding the waves. Great value, service, and people. Go with Kapowui!< /review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< gmapID>

We had Corey for our first lesson ever and even though he teaches advances surfers as well, he was super professional and patient (even with me who couldn’t click from position 2 to 3 smoothly at first)! Definitely recommended for a beginner lesson; the guys who teach are super friendly, Mar handles the communication/ management/payment with ease, and they have things locked in for a great time!! Would definitley book again next time we’re here!

<Review>What an amazing place!! Had so much fun with Ryan, who was really patient with us, I even managed to catch a couple of waves by the end of the lesson! Would 100% recommend to anyone who is thinking of trying it - surfing is quite challenging but it is so rewarding. We even saw a pod of dolphins while we were out practicing!

Sorry it took so long to leave you guys a review - will definitely be back! Going to start practicing more here in the UK for sure :)<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>Amazing surf lesson! Conner was patient, encouraging, and really helpful correcting my moves after every ride. I’m a beginner but have taken classes in LA and Costa Rica and Conner is one of the best I’ve had. He really offers specific feedback to make sure you can catch waves on your own. Highly recommend!</Text>< pictures>

I had the time of my life getting back on a board today! It had been about 5 years and I had the sudden impulse to try my hand again. The board selection here is great (and beautiful colors, too; mine was turquoise) and if you’re short on time, you can rent for only an hour. This is what I tried to do, but as soon as I was in the water I knew I was calling into work. I was hooked. Definitely give this charming rental company in Santa Monica a try if you’re there! Look for the yellow van and see if Hailee is available to help you with your questions as she was super nice, very knowledgeable, and definitely helped me have a fun morning (which of course turned into a fun afternoon) at the beach!</Text>

<Review>Booked a two-hour surfing class as my spouse’s surprise birthday gift! He has so much fun learning to surf for the first time. He said his instructor was so patient with him. Also despite my spouse being late for twenty minutes, his instructor kindly extended the lesson so he still got nearly two hours of pure fun. This business got all five-star reviews for a good reason: you are incredible!</Review><gmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</gmapID>< pics>

<Review>Eduardo was such a great instructor!! This was my first time in the ocean and he made me feel comfortable the entire time! I was able to stand on the board multiple times during the first class and I believe it’s because he taught us great timing. Marjan was the sweetest and got us situated quickly in the morning. I felt welcome, had so much fun, and I’ll definitely be back for more!!!!<//Review><pictures>None</pictures><response>None<//response><GmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9<//GmapID></record></dataset><record>

Checked off an item from the bucket list today, thanks to Hailee at Kapowui! She was an amazing instructor for this surfing newbie. 😆 She taught us everything we needed to know and was incredibly patient while helping us figure out how to stand up and actually surf in the water. Ahah. Great lesson, great company, cool van! Highly recommend!!!</text>

This surf school is fantastic!! Everyone I’ve interacted with here is beyond friendly and always make me feel welcome and part of the Kapowui family.  I have mainly surfed with Corey and he’s amazing, definitely helping my surfing get to the next level!!</text>

<Resp>None</Resp><text>Great lesson with Corey.

I am pretty active and had been on a board a few times so he was able to adjust the lesson to my skill level.

I struggled with keeping my eyes up and foot placement when standing up and he was able to quickly identify both and help me correct them.

By the end of the lesson, I was standing up and turning on my own for a few seconds at a time.
I will definitely be back for more coaching once I get a little more comfortable on a board.</text><user_id>116726010047765919127<//user_id><pics>None<//pics>< Gmap_id>

Connor was amazing! He was very articulate and easy to learn from. He makes sure that you’re comfortable before you actually go out on the water! I would definitely take Connor’s lessons again! I felt so good after I left and that I actually know how to surf!< /Text>

Had an absolutely awesome day out in the water with Tyler! Came in with no expectations of being able to get up on the board, having never surfed ever before, but his instruction was so helpful and he was so patient and found the best waves, that in the end, I got up not once, but multiple multiple  times!! Will definitely be back for more lessons. Thank you so much Kapowui!!!</Review>

<review>I decided last minute to book a lesson with Kapowui surf school and am so glad I did.
Mark did a great job recommending Corey to me who was the perfect instructor for me.
He gave me a refresher of the basics, did an assessment and tailored the lesson exactly to my needs/skills. I even extended the lesson because it was so much fun. I took away so much from this experience and hope to come back to LA one day to do it again.
Thank you.< /review>< rating>

I have taken surfing lessons before in Hawaii and SE Asia, but could never stand up on the surfboard. During my first lesson with Corey he guaranteed I could stand up and I did it!! During my second lesson we could already seen a statistically significant improvement :p
Everyone there is super friendly and encouraging. Going surfing has become one of the things I look forward most to during a pandemic.

My 15 year old did her first lesson this week and it was fantastic. She did the recommended 1.5 hours and really got to know the basics of surfing. Everyone was super professional and skilled - she felt encouraged and safe. She plans on surfing every week she can this summer and we will definitely book more classes! thank you!<//review>

I took my 14 years old daughter to our first time surfing. I was concerned about the language barrier since English is my second language. But it turned out a great experience with Tyler’s coaching. He is very patient and clearly instructional. Also he gave feedback after each surf. We can both stand up on board in the first lesson , this is surprising us. We recommend Kapowui and coach Tyler.<//Text>

Clay was a great instructor and good at splitting up his time between my friends and I! He was easy to understand and attentive at telling us what to do/explain the waves. Overall great experience!</text>

Kids had a great first experience surfing! I called Kapowui Surf Lessons Santa Monica the same day we were hoping to surf. Majeen was so kind on the phone and helped me schedule online with the instructor Haley! We arrived at the beach to find the yellow van with Martin & Haley, we got set up with boards & wet suits! Cute colors & great style! Off to the beach for the lesson, Haley was really nice and the kids loved it! They were able to get up on the board and even surf for a while after the lesson on their own. Great day at the beach! So happy we found Kapowui Surf! We will continue to surf with them! If your interested I would highly recommend them, the whole experience went smooth!< /Review>

Thank you Kapowui and my trainer Corey! You guys were professional, patient, and gave me a whole lot of confidence. I rode about a countless amount of waves all the way to the sand thanks to Corey. Will definitely be back ASAP. 🤙🏻🏄🏻‍♂️ Appreciate you guys! Few more lessons til I’m a pro!< /text>

First time surfing. Had a great experience with this surf school and my instructor, Alex, was a really great guy; probably one of the best instructors I have met. I got a short introduction to the surfboard and did some practice on land, and then the party started. Managed to ride a couple of waves successfully (my balance and learning abilities are horrible, so if I can pull it off, so can you) We took a short break in the middle of the lesson to swim up close to some dolphins! This experience definitely surpassed my expectations and it was the best day I had in Los Angeles.<//text>

<text>Surf class with the Kapowui family is truly the best thing that could ever happened during my trip in California, in June 2019. It is not only surf lessons. Surfing showed me what life is all about: never give up(and yet so much more!!!). You will fall off the plank but this feeling inside when you stand on it is worth a thousand falls. Surfing is my best life memory so far. So jump ahead and surf. Be the conqueror of your past self and embrace your inner power. With this family, they won't  let you down until you can do it!
Thank you all so much.
Love and stay awesome!< /text>< Pics>

I am a 54 year old female who had never surfed before, but Todd B was an excellent and patient instructor, and Kapowui! I got up the first attempt and had an awesome ride! I was able to ride waves most of the 2 hour lesson - exhilarating, challenging and addicting.

I’ll be back! <3<//review>

The moment I arrived I felt comfortable and accepted. My instructor Lucas worked with me every step of the way and gave me wonderful feed back as I began my surfing experience. He kept me safe, as the current was very strong at the time and provided me with the knowledge to keep myself safe before entering the ocean. We luaghed allot and the entire lesson was wonderful. I can't wait to go back and try again.< /review>

I’ve gone here multiple times for lessons and had a blast both times! The instructors know what they’re doing. They give you feedback so you can get better with each wave you catch. If I take more lessons, it will be through Kapowui. If I don’t, it’s cuz I got my own board and am doing it on my own 😊<//text>

Mark and Luke were SO NICE!! I’m a brand new surfer and was pretty nervous but they made me feel relaxed and gave great instruction. They were super knowledgeable about which waves were good for us and kept it chill and fun 😊🌊☀️< /Review>

So fun! I highly recommend these guys if you are at all intimidated about getting out there and enjoying the waves. He breaks all the steps down and will get you riding a wave in your first session.</Review>

I found this place as I was skating by the other day, I took a picture and didn't think much of it. However today was my brother's birthday and couldn't think of a better place to take him but here.

I been surfing for some time but my brother always been wanting to learn. My instructor was TODD and he was amazing. I learned so many tip and tricks that made surfing much more enjoyable. Being self taught, I've developed many bad habits and I didn't think I'd learned so much.<//Text>

<name>yareli flores<//name><Text>My boyfriend and I were just going to visit Venice Beach when we saw Kapowui surfing and decided to give it a try. Initially, I was very hesitant since I do not know how to swim, but I was encouraged to try it out. I was able to catch and ride some waves as soon as we hit the water. Our experience was excellent and I highly recommended this to anyone who comes across the Kapowui surf team.</Text>< Date>

This was the BEST experience of our Los Angeles visit by a landslide! We chose Will as our instructor and he was so chill & a great teacher. Very patient and great at helping us learn safely. We both actually managed to stand up on and ride some waves - and it was our first time ever surfing! Incredible value, too, $200 for 90 minutes of (private) surfing lessons for 2 people and you get all the gear included in that. Make this happen - you won't regret it!</text>

Highly recommend taking a lesson here ! I had a 2 hour session early Sunday morning with Alex. He was a great instructor and also just a cool dude. It was my first time surfing but he got me up surfing right away, and by the end of the session he was catching waves along side me! 10/10 would recommend.< /Review>

First time surfing and had a blast!! Conner was extremely helpful and had a lot of energy (enough to push us out multiple times!). Highly recommend- definitely will be back next time we’re in Santa Monica.< /Review>

< Review>
Me and a few friends came from atlanta to Cali for our friends bday and she wanted to learn how to surf.

We called Kapowui surf club and Martin was our instructor and he was absolutely AMAZING!!! He taught us sooooo much about surfing and we actually rode several waves.

He was the surfing god and he looked like him too (wink wink) loljj.< /Review>

Awesome surf lesson, enthusiastic and attentive instructor that led me through each step. Thorough walk through on the sand then a great instructor led session in the water.

Definitely will be coming back for a second time<//Review>

<Text>I can not heap enough praise on Kapowui at Venice for the absolute best people to teach you to surf. We presented them with a challenge, teach our two Autistic children to surf, and they went over & above anything we could have hoped for. Karla was selected as their Instructor because of her qualifications, skill & experience with children with special needs. She had my children in the water, after teaching them all the safety skills they needed and they were standing on their boards in no time. The had so much fun because Karla's way of teaching has having fun as it's core principle. Not for one second did I have any worry about the children's safety because Karla was right there, beside them every single step of the way.  Kapowui is more than a company that teaches you to surf, it is a family in every sense and you feel that immediately. Karla you gave Jordan & Hayley the best thing anyone could give them, you gave them a love of surfing. Myself and the two newest members of Kapowui Surf Family can't thank you enough. We will see you next year.< /Text>< Pictures>

I had my surf lesson today with Eduardo / Ed and he was AMAZING!! Eduardo taught me step-by-step the best way to get up on the board and catered what I struggled with previously to ensure I got up properly. Eduardo was attentive, supportive and very encouraging! I had an awesome time surfing -Eduardo said he’d get me on the board for 10 waves and I ended up surfing on more than 20 from Eduardo’s helpful tips and guidance. 100% recommend and ask for Eduardo!<//Text>

Started and ended my lessons at Kapowui so stoked! Even after one lesson with Conner I was riding waves. After two more lessons I am surprised at how far I’ve come. I highly recommend this surf school if you’re looking for the perfect blend of professionalism and fun.</Text>

I had a great experience learning how to surf with Madeline at Kapowui Surf Lessons. I had never surfed before so I was a little nervous going into it but by the end I was hooked and can’t wait to try it again. We started with a lesson on the sand to learn the four steps to getting into the surf position. We repeated it a number of times and received feedback from Madeline about how to improve. She made sure the three of us in the lesson had a good understanding and were able to perform the moves before we went into the water. In the water she would help us catch the wave and indicate when we needed to stand up. This was helpful so we could focus on applying the techniques that we learned on the sand. Again Madeline provided feedback after each time and was very easy going making it a more enjoyable experience. We had a blast and I look forward to the next lesson.</review>

They are a pleasure to work with from booking thru the end of class. Everyone involved is lovely, knowledgeable and friendly. It can be a bit intimidating to be a true beginner but not so with their wonderful team. You will have a wonderful time.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< Resp>

Martin was a great instructor. He really took the time to make sure we had our fundamentals down before we got in the water. Because of that I was able to stand up on my first wave.</Review>

Definitely the best surf school in LA!  My instructor Tyler had me surfing within the first 30 mins, and I've been improving ever since.  Great for first-time surfers, or for those of us improving skills to be able to surf bigger waves.< /text>

My sister (14 yo) and I (17 yo) booked a lesson package with Hayle and the first one was already awesome! She was so patient and supportive through out. And her knowledge of all things surf is evident. It was so enjoyable and fun to be around her and she made us super comfortable getting started. Martin, the surfer chief, and the other staff too were also super friendly, enjoyable, and knowledgeable. I definitely recommend booking and I can’t wait for my next lesson!!! Go Kapowi!!<//Text>

I chose Kapowui for my first surfing lessons (2 h + 1 h lesson) and I can highly recommend Kapowui Surf Club. They are all easy going, very friendly, the communication is very good and the instructions by Todd were perfect ;), so good that I managed to stand up on the board and was able to "surf" several times during my first surf lesson despite very bad and challenging conditions. Gern wieder ;) Thank you! See you at the beach! :)

Was up instantly crushing waves with ease.
Felt like a pro!
It came super easy due to Hailey knowing her stuff.

Definitely do this!< /Review>< pictures>

Blake was an excellent surf instructor! He was so nice and so patient because he was making sure me and my friend were learning on our own pace. He was also extremely fun and welcoming. We both enjoyed our selves so much and it was because of Blake. He encouraged me and taught me so well that I was able to catch a few waves and this was the very first day I’ve ever surfed!!!< /review>

Took a 2 hour lesson with Alex, and haven’t had that much fun in years. Alex was extremely professional, showing me the in’s and out’s before heading out to the ocean. I was able to pick it up rather quickly, and he adapted his teaching to my progression. I will definitely be coming back!!< /Text>

<review>TL;DR: Kapowui is the real deal! Ultimate value for money, personalized instructions, surfing at a no-crowd part of the beach, and detailed feedback at every step, resulting in quick progress and a great experience.

The Details:

A little bit of background before I go into the details of my experience with Kapowui. As of the date of posting this review, I had been surfing for 3-4 months but was never able to fully ride a green wave (face of an unbroken wave). I had taken a couple of lessons at another surfing school, but my experience was far from satisfactory. Neither did I get the private lessons I had been promised, nor did I get detailed feedback. I decided to try out Kapowui after looking at reviews, and I wish I had started out with Kapowui in the first place.

Martin, the owner, was extremely friendly and asked me to try out a class first and then decide if I wanted to sign up for a package deal. My first class was with Gregory (Greg) aka G-Force. He is a highly experienced surfer  and an exceptional instructor (15+ years experience teaching). He corrected some bad practices I had picked up, and had me surfing green waves within 30 minutes!

After that experience, I decided to sign up for 5 classes at once, and took another class with Greg. I felt like I had taken some big strides in terms of my surfing ability, and was able to catch green waves more consistently.

Another big plus is that Kapowui is located near a beach that is near-secluded in the off-season, so you don't have to worry about being hit by oncoming surfers. It's a lot more relaxing when you focus on the surfing part, which is difficult as it is.

If you are looking for that one-off experience as a tourist, or looking to crank your skills up a notch, Kapowui is the place you want to be.<//review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

<review>Very professional approach.  Great website. They park their cool 60s Volkswagon van at the parking entrance as a nice visual intro (can't miss them).  They supply the boards and wetsuits, a discount for multiple people, but most importantly excellent instruction.  Blake taught my two daughters land drills for the prone position, a lunge move to get upright, and balance tips.  He offered great descriptive and prescriptive feedback when either daughter needed adjustments and encouragement.  This takes about 1/2 hour, so I suggest signing up for the 1.5 hour session to give you a full hour in the water.  He promised both girls would succeed in getting up and riding some waves.  He was right. One daughter caught on and had multiple successes.  He continued working hard with the other daughter until she got up and rode a solid wave all the way in. Blake showed patience throughout with a pleasant demeanor and comforting approach. I would suggest him, but I am sure Martin would only hire excellent instructors so you will do well with whoever instructs you.  Thanks Blake and Martin.

Me and my husband took a class from Madeline and she is the best! We had so much fun and learned so much in a short amount of time. We lucked out with amazing weather and beautiful waves. This company is owned by a family and they really care about your experience. Madeline is a thoughtful instructor and really watches the conditions to give you the best experience. Will definitely be back every time we are in LA.</review>

We had a great time with Kapowui.
With my wife and our two kids we had our first surf class.
The team and the instructor were amazing, super friendly and patient.
At the end of the lesson we were able to stand on the surf :)

Marty is the BEST! We’re out here from Chicago and just went surfing for the first time.
Caught a bunch of waves, sunshine, and most importantly laughs.
Will be surfing with Marty and kapowui again real soon!< /Review>

Kapowui rocks! Just finished an incredible lesson with G-Force (aka Greg) at Venice Beach. I am a beginner and my brother is beginner-intermediate, and G-Force is fantastic. He was able to coach us both at our levels. I feel so much more comfortable with reading the waves, balance, surf etiquette, even the local breaks! Can’t wait to get out again!< /Text>

Had a lesson yesterday with Colston and I’m super stoked about the experience. Never surfed before and the guy was really patient and was very thorough. We were both determined to get me standing up on the board and I’m pumped that it actually happened. I definitely recommend this experience to anyone who has never surfed before. It was epic! Thanks again!!</Text>

Had an awesome one-on-one lesson with Ryan! It was my first time ever trying to surf and was able to get up on at least 10 waves on my first lesson. Gear, level of instruction and location were all perfect. Will definitely come back next time I'm in Santa Monica.<//Text>

Our daughter is very much enjoying her first surf lessons ever and has learned a lot already after two private classes. We are happy with the attitude and experience of this engaged group of surfers. Her instructor Connor has been conscientously keeping her safe and enthusiastic. Beautiful beach mornings in southern Cali.</review>

I took 3 lessons with this crew and had a blast each time. Connor and Tyler took me out and put me on waves I could handle and were fun to hang with. I'm coming back in a few weeks and will be coming back!< /text>

Very good place to get a lesson! They have a cool team working there and are very helpful with any questions, surf or non-surf related. I started with little surfing experience. Ive wake surfed before but this was a lot different. I was able to get up on the board and ride a few waves into shore by the end of the lesson. That was the same for the other two individual that took the class, except neither of them had any type of surf experience. They are affordable and actually offer cheaper options if you do a group lessons. The Kapowui team definitely set me up for surfing success! 🤙🏻Lastly, I want to mention that i was able to take my skills gained from this experience and rent a board in Santa Cruz, WITHOUT the need of another lesson, and had loads of fun!< /Review>

Martin is a great teacher! I had some surfing lessons before, but he really explains all you need to know and you are ready to go and catch the waves! Definitely worth checking out, if you want to learn how to surf!

Today I went for a surfing class with Lulu and she was amazing! So patient & gave me plenty of useful tips, how I can improve my still very basic surfing skills! The class was so much fun & definitely a perfect way to start your day in LA :) THANK YOU SO MUCH <3</Review>

Took a lesson with Todd for 2 hours and he was hyper detailed, attentive and patient. He checked in whether I had questions and how I was feeling throughout our session. And even at the end when I thought I was out of gas, he got me to do one more wave. The best experience!< /Text>

These guys are amazing. Our instructor was Juan, he was relentlessly energetic, friendly and fun the entire time. We were all into it so much that we went over our appointment time by quite a while without even noticing. The instruction was great, he taught right to our beginner level and we left the lesson feeling like we'd learned a lot; we both managed to ride an entire wave within the first 10 minutes in the water.

While there we also met the owner, Martin who was super friendly and welcoming. The same goes for the other teachers we met while hanging out. Great group of folks all around, we couldn't recommend Kapowui high enough.</text>

<text>Amazing experience! Had taken a couple lessons elsewhere before but never really had the confidence to go out on my own.  Todd is a great teacher, got us both ready to catch big waves (4-6ft) within two hours.  Stoked to get back out there and try again!< /text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<text>Had the most amazing surf lesson, thanks to our instructor Todd! The waves were a great size, some were intimidating at first, but he guides you and only picks the right waves based on your experience level. It was the most informative surf lesson we’ve taken, these guys are experts and make you feel very safe. We had a blast and would highly recommend you go with this company over anyone else in the area.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

<Text>My boys took surf lessons with Blanke on December 26, 2019. It was my oldest son‘s birthday and he wanted to try surfing. His younger brother tagged along for fun.   They had such a great time! Blake was easy going, and he’s a great instructor. He really motivated the boys to get the most out of the two hour session. We are happy to say that both boys were able to get up on their boards and surf. When we come back to LA, we will certainly look up the Kapowui brothers again for surf lessons! Next time the whole family will try it.  Aloha!</Text>< Time>

<review>Best time ever! If this 47-year can catch some waves at the end of her Excellent, Fun, Challenging lesson ... anyone can!! I'm HOOKED! Seriously, a great, knowledgeable, safe learning environment. Dylan was a spectacular, gently-firm (does that make sense?!) instructor who really, really wanted me to succeed, and I did! Thanks to him! I highly recommend this surf school. Thank you all for the encouragement and positivity!<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<Text>My siblings were visiting LA and I brought them to Kapowui and it was an incredible time!  Gregory (G-Force) is an incredible instructor; he got us in the surfing spirit and made for a great experience!  A couple dolphins even swam by.  Cannot recommend this place enough!

We had a great time! Will was an awesome instructor. I’d recommend Kapowui to anyone who is looking to learn to surf!</Text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

<review>This is coming from someone who before never even stood on a surfboard let alone ride one. I come from the landlocked state of Colorado and after only 2 lessons I was able to stand up and ride a wave. What a rush! Martin's teaching style is great he's patient and tailors his teaching methods to fit the clients abilities and meddle. I definitely recommend.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>I was a first time surfer from the east coast looking for a lesson while visiting LA for work. Gregory was an awesome instructor and incredibly patient. He spent time walking thorough each step in the process and was encouraging even when I kept getting smashed by waves. Highly recommend Kapowui for a first time surfer!<//review>< Pics>

I had my best surfing day ever with Kapowui surfing! Haylee was my instructor and was super great - helped me learn how to read waves and adjust my board position. I learned more with one lesson with Haylee than a 6 week course at another place. Highly recommend!<//review>

<Text>First time surfing for me and my wife, and we could not have chosen a better crew to do it with! Madeline was such an awesome instructor - super thoughtful, caring and made sure we learned all the fundamentals. We caught a bunch of waves with her and my wife had a blast. We’re total converts.

First time surfing and it was freaking amazing! These guys were amazing! Very professional, very detailed and in depth instructions before you even hit the water. Once your out there they don't give you more than you can handle, Dylan was our instructor and he was the best. Felt super comfortable with him. Definitely recommend 10/10. I'm going to come back any time I'm in town< /Text>

<Review>If you've always wanted to try out surfing, you should definitely try out Kapowui. The staff there is very laid back and they really take care of their customers. Nothing but good vibes all around. Todd was an excellent surf instructor. Today was my first time surfing and I was able to stand on the board. Just listen carefully to his instructions and you'll be fine. 10/10!</Review>< pics>

We had a lesson with Will, and we totally recommend him as your future  instructor, I bet all of them are great. Will was patient and understanding, he taught us a lots of things about surfing. We were tired after those lessons, but it was definitely worth it. If you want to have a great experience like us, you should buy lessons with Kapowui, and don’t think about it. You won’t be disappointed. We’ll come back to them in the future for sure.</Review>< time>

I had my lesson with Corey Biggs last week.  He was an awesome instructor.  I highly recommend.  He really helps you to learn the basics on land to make sure you're prepared for when you head out into the water.  I tried surfing a times on my own before taking the class with him but i really had a hard time standing up on the board and being able to enjoy surfing.  With Corey's help and the new techniques he taught me I was able to stand up on a lot of the waves in the class.  I had so much fun i went and grabbed my surfboard after the class and continued surfing.  It was such a night and day difference.  I could catch most of the waves and ride them to shore!!!!  It was so much fun and i didnt want to stop.  I highly recommend Corey Biggs and the Kapowui surf school.  They will get you riding and loving the waves!!!!</review>

<name>Bill Choslovsky</name><Review>Phenomenal all around.  First, was easy to book.  Second, it's the authentic SoCal surfing experience, starting with meeting at the funky Kapowui van in the parking lot.  Third, the lesson with Madeline was killer.  I signed my 15 year old daughter up, who has had lessons in the past with only male instructors.  This was great.  As good as Madeline's surfing and teaching abilities were, she's even a better human being.  Highly recommend.< /Review>< date>

We had an absolute blast! Totally, recommend Kapowui if you want to do surfing in Venice Beach they're fantastic! Knowledgeable, friendly, patient, and super helpful. Will is an absolute beast and put on his own little show at the end of our lesson. Will was patient and helpful with every individual in our group, such an awesome company for any level of surfing. Thanks guys for an incredible experience!< /Review>

A must visit team. It was so easy and pleasant to schedule classes when we called Martin. He scheduled us for the following day with Carl who is an amazing instructor. He is friendly, reassuring and has a great energy through out the entire class. He spent carefully explaining the safely measures and the basics outside the water and then we spent an hour with him in the water guiding us with each wave. We are going back again for two more conservative days of lessons with Carl (from South Africa 🇿🇦)
Of course the sunny LA sky in mid July at 9am class, gentle 3’ Waves and a surprise visit from school of dolphins that gracefully paid us a visit in the middle of ocean added to the thrill of beginners luck. Thank you Kapowui for being here today and giving us such remarkable experience. 😎🏄🏻🏄🏻🏄‍♀️🐬<//Text>

Definitely go with Kapowui!  My instructor, Ruben,   Was super knowledgeable, personable and very conscientious to go at a pace that suited me.  He gave me great insight on things to tweak between each wave and I was definitely standing up by the end of my lesson!   Entirely free of charge he provided charmingly casual conversation while waiting for the perfect wave. ;)< /text>

We were looking into taking surfing lessons since we both had never done it before. For a beginner the 1.5 hour package was perfect and the instructor was absolutely amazing. She was very patient and took the time to work with each of us. By the end both of us were able to stand and ride the waves in.< /Text>

Surfing class at Kapowui is the perfect mix between our Beach-Boys based, bleached-blonde fantasy of California surfing and the actual, real, raw athletic effort that any sport requires.
In my first class with lovely Haylee we began with learning on the sand the basic four technical steps that take any surfer (including Patrick Swayze in Point Break) from flat belly down on the board to up on your feet riding the hurricane of your life.
But no, once in the water, I rode no hurricanes and I definitely did not look—neither feel—like the female version of Swayze. Well, the pink-shaded waves of this sunny yet impalpable California dawn did feel like hurricanes to my inexperience, though, especially each time I fell off the board even before hitting step four, the one that actually places your feet on the board, your upper body all the way up and your eyes into your freedom (the moment when the fun is supposed to begin, basically).
One time (maybe three, but two of them count only as a rehearsal), with the assistance and the direction of Haylee, for a few seconds that felt like a serendipitous eternity, I was actually able to catch, feel and maintain my balance and ride my personal Friday morning's hurricane (probably the most peaceful wave ever in the history of the entire Pacific Ocean). And, that really felt like an accomplishment! Another accomplishment was when I started understanding what I was doing wrong, like when I was leaning too much forward (and therefore falling into the water even before standing up on the board) or when I was trying to get up and catch the wave too soon or too late (and, by doing that, I was completely missing the momentum and the physical and spiritual connection with the wave).
But, above all, it's the intimacy with the ocean, that I enjoyed the most. Since I took a semi-private class, while Haylee was working with the other student, I had long moments on my own. As I had just been taught to always place my board's nose (yeah, that's how they call it) toward the horizon (Haylee was pretty clear about the surfer's etiquette in the water!), I could breath in the mysterious dissolution of that blue far end-line while receiving the gift of the most magical dance choreographed by a family of silver fishes (I swear I never saw one single fish in the ocean, before) and admiring the million dollar flight of the immeasurably powerful yet gracefully humble seagulls.
Indeed a blessed experience, this first surf lesson, thanks to the professionalism of the Kapowui's team and my teacher Haylee's training tips and health-safety supervision.
Heading back home to get the sand off my feet, now. Listening to a Beach Boys' song, of course!</text>

I highly recommend Kapowui to anyone who wants to take surf lessons in the LA area.
I live in LA and have tried a few other surf lesson providers in the area.  I've also gone surfing a few times with local guides on tropical vacations.  The quality of instruction and positive vibes at Kapowui far exceeds the local competition.  I find myself enjoying the lessons with Kapowui at Venice just as much as I have enjoyed my surf sessions in the tropics (and they don't have the help of 80 degree water and gently peeling reef breaks).
So far I have taken 15+ lessons with Kapowui.  I can feel progress after each session.  All of the instructors give sound advice and quality tips while also maintaining a fun atmosphere.  Recently I've had more sessions with Carl, and he's really helped me improve a lot.  I also recommend Todd and Ryan.
In summary, go surfing with Kapowui! It'll be fun!<//text>

<review>My family had an excellent experience with Kapowui surf lessons.   My wife, daughter, and son learned for the first time with Mark, and my son had a follow-up lesson with Haile.  Both Mark and Haile were patient and clear with their instructions, and my family is now encouraged to continue with surfing going forward.  The Kapowui team is energetic and positive for both kids and grown-ups.

Carl the instructor was fantastic with our group of 3.  Waves were great for beginners at this location, with a few very large sets.  We were glad to have an expert watching out for us who could see the scale of waves coming from a distance.  I highly recommend bringing an expert out with you for your first several times/days going out, their expertise is invaluable.  We all had some success and also some fantastic wipeouts.  Thanks Carl!< /text>

Marty is great, but his employee stole my ID. They hold your ID for surf board, I forgot it I’m the shuffle of leaving and then his employee Marjon said to meet her at a bar to retrieve my ID. In that process she was an hour late and claim she “lost” my ID. Have to fly home tomorrow. Thanks for screwing me</Text>

My Dad and I are from England and Texas respectively so do not have any surf experience at all but decided while were in LA to try it out. What an amazing experience! Carl was a great teacher and explained things in a way that we would understand. They guaranteed to get you standing up on the board and they duly delivered!

I cannot recommend this enough if you are staying in the area - a great team of guys and a great experience!

Cheers!

Couldn’t have had a better few lessons. My instructor Will made me feel comfortable and improved my skills from previous experience surfing. I really got the most out of the lesson and after each wave I was shown how to improve to become a better surfer. Thanks so much! Will definitely be back when I’m next in LA< /Text>

Kapowui surf school is the best! I have never gone surfing before and I couldn’t have picked a better company to learn from! While scheduling our lesson online my friend mentioned we were absolute beginners and we got matched up for a lesson with Harry. First, Harry made sure we were all comfortable during the land portion. He expertly explained the different components of the board and gave us a quick class on ocean conditions. Next during the practical portion he encouraged us and gave us feedback on our form after every wave we rode. I felt safe having him as a teacher and under his instruction my friends and I all managed to get up on board by ourselves! It was a truly incredible experience and I now feel like I have the knowledge to go out and try surfing by myself. I will definitely be renting my equipment from the Kapowui school in the future! Highly recommend this place!<//review>

He made sure we knew the fundamentals before getting out on the water, and never left my side!

The board and wetsuit quality worked great for the area.

Would highly reccomend and will be back!<//text><pics>None</pics><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I highly recommend Kapowui! I’ve surfed a few times, but needed to get the mechanics down a bit better and learn how to read the waves. Colston was a great instructor and helped me achieve my goals.< /Review></record>

I surfed for the first time this morning. It was AMAZING! It was a 1 1/2 hour session at Venice Beach with Ruben from Kapowui, and I LOVE surfing! ❤️ I will definitely be back. Ruben was SO fun and kind. He was a good teacher and was understanding when I fell. The lesson was SUPER FUN and very easy. I’m thirteen with NO experience, and I popped up at least ten times in  the 1 hour! (Thanks Ruben!) The wetsuits and boards are super high quality, and I didn’t get too cold. Kapowui is definitely the best and most fun surfing experience on the beach! 🤙🤟❤️🏄‍♀️

It is always nice to have people be very kind and helpful when learning a new skill, especially when you're not sure if that skill is something you're capable of! Kapowui instructors made me feel comfortable and then excited to try surfing! Being from a small town in the south, we hardly see the beach. My surf instructor helped me past my fears and had me up on the board! Thank you, Kapowui for all the fun and I will be back next summer!< /text>

Greg G-Force was the bastion of positive energy I needed coming into our lesson. From the breathing exercises to prepare us for the day to the specific tips to improve, I highly recommend booking with him!

So we came back...and G-Force did it again!! Not only did he remember our names and faces from last sesh but also he built on the basics he taught us in our first lesson. This time focusing on turning and speeding up/slowing down, we definitely took it to the next level. If you’re going Kapowui (which you should!) you gotta go with G-Force!<//Review>

I was a little nervous because I’m cautious about getting too far into the water and I’m definitely not the most coordinated or athletic person. Anyway, Harry was so friendly and patient with me and explained everything I needed to know to begin my journey as a surfer. I had the 2 hour session (if you’re brand new to surfing I would certainly recommend) and had plenty of time to practice, gather myself and practice some more. I made huge progress and actually ended my session with the best wave ride of the day. Looking forward to to going back again!!< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Our instructor Todd was amazing.  He spent 3 hours with us (me 51 and my 3 daughters 14,12,9) in the water and got all of us up in the the 20 min.  My girls had a blast and wanted to keep going after the lesson.  They are all hooked.  Todd was patient and made the entire experience enjoyable.

Monty the owner was super supportive and friendly.  I brought my own GoPro and some how it had run out of battery and Monty was kind enough to let us use one of theirs at no charge.  Great operation all around.  👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾</text>

<Review>Had an excellent 2-person lesson with Carl then came back a second day to rent equipment and practice more.  Carl, who is a competitive surfer, taught the fundamentals beach side then assisted in the surf.  Thanks to his help and instruction I was able to stand multiple times and ride some waves from break to beach.  It was a fun and exhilarating experience.   Don't expect to hang ten the first time out but what a fun sport to take on.  Surfing is like life, you try, you fall down, you succeed now and then, and you keep climbing back on for more.   Thanks Kapowui and Carl for a memorable time!!   Highly recommended.< /Review>< date>

Amazing experience. I just moved to LA and this has been something I’ve been wanting to try. The team has great attitudes, great teachers and over a super caring and positive vibe to feel comfortable learning.

Thank you!!< /Review>

I would suggest anybody that is a first timer or novice surfer to take lessons from Kapowui. Blake and the rest of the crew were patient and informative. Excellent crew. Thank you Blake!< /Text>

<Text>Took a 2 hour lesson with Alex and he was awesome. My first time surfing and got up on 3 waves. Alex set me up with great instructions and keep my safety in mind all the time. The owner Martin was so chill to help me set up my lesson at the last moment. This was the first time I’d tried surfing and I’d say Kapowui was the best choice.<//Text><gmapID>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</gmapID><username>Marko Metzinger< /username>< pictures>

<Review>Most memorable experience of our trip to California by far. First time surfing for my boyfriend and I, and we managed to catch some waves (despite our relative lack of athleticism)! Our instructor Garret was patient, intuitive, and super friendly. Thanks for memories Kapowui!<//Review>< Rating>

Would definitely recommend this place! My friends and I had a great 2 hr private lesson with Harry. He worked hard nonstop to help us catch every wave we could get. The beach session was really instructive and communication was straight forward. I was new to surfing and it was nice to get feedback after every missed wave and cheered on after successful ones. I honestly didn't expect my first time surfing to be so fun! Thanks<//Review>

<text>The reviews are true, Kapowui is awesome!  The entire staff could not be nicer and more accommodating. I am a beginner and had injured my knee surfing about 4 months ago (surfing by myself) and decided it was time to learn the right way to surf. My instructor Travis was a pro, he showed me what I was doing wrong and more importantly how to safely surf (thanks Travis!). I booked a two hour session (well worth it) and by the end of it I felt like I was getting up on at least 80% of the waves.The whole experience was top notch and I would highly recommend to anyone that wants to learn how to surf.<//text>< gmapID>

Reuben was an awesome instructor! Ive been surfing for 8 years summer months in NY for most of my life. He asked first what my skill level was, checked my pop up stance and proceeded to throw me in water to guage what I needed work on. He was super insightful, knowledgeable and awesome on the board(he almost got pitted). He would show me his style and thought process on how he would catch a wave. I highly recommend him to anyone who's planning to try this school out that is at any skill level. You wont go wrong!<//Text>

We took a group of 14 people out and everyone had a such a great experience- I would highly recommend booking with them! The whole Kapowui team was extremely knowledgable, friendly and made everyone feel safe in the water (90% of our group were first-time surfers!). Ruben, Will & Ryan were our awesome instructors for the day and each of them took the time to make sure everyone in our group was having a great time and getting up on the board. Overall, it was really easy and fun to book with them - also, the owner, Martin is a super friendly guy with the cutest puppy! He introduced himself to our squad and we will def. book another lesson with them!!</Text>

<text>I highly recommend Katowice surf lessons! We are visiting from New Jersey to Venice beach for a few days and our 3 kids ages 8,10 and 12 had lessons with Ryan. He was awesome! He took extra special care with my kids. They had the time of their life. Ryan made the experience for the first time surfing for my kids just awesome . Highly recommended if you want to learn to surf when in Venice beach!< /text>< pics>

I had an amazing experience surfing with Kapowui in Venice beach! The instructor was very thoughtful, caring and made sure I had an awesome experience. Whether you’re looking for a fun active beach activity and/or want to learn the surfing basics - this is it!! Catch them in Venice beach off rose avenue. Thanks Kapowui!< /Text>

I had the best time learning how to surf with Kapowui. I brought a few friends along and we had Carl as our instructor. He was highly talented as well as hilarious, making sure we knew fundamentals and safety while cracking us up along the way. My roommate and I plan on doing another lesson in a couple weeks to continue our fun. I highly recommend  Kapowui to learn how to surf!!!</text>

As a beginner surfer with no experience whatsoever, I was excited to try the sport but wasn’t sure how easy it would be to catch onto. We took a 2 hour lesson with Ruben at the Venice beach location and he had all three of us standing up and riding waves into the shore in no time. Ruben was thorough in his explanations, answered any questions that we had, and cheered us on the whole time. He was also very personable, therefore made us very comfortable with him and with getting out on the boards. You can see that he is very passionate about the sport and loves to share it with others. I would absolutely take another surf lesson with him and definitely recommend him to anyone looking to take a lesson with Kapowui!< /text>

Awesome experience! Dylan was an amazing instructor and very knowledgeable. He had me standing up and riding waves by my second try. This was my first time surfing but definitely not my last. Highly recommend and I will be back.<//Text>

My first surfing experience was amazing thanks to these guys!  Our instructor Juan was attentive, funny, engaging, and truly dedicated to making sure we knew the basics before taking us out onto the waves.  A truly gratifying adventure that I'll never forget.  The owner Marty was also very helpful and welcoming, giving me a few tips to keep in mind for my next sojourn into the waves.  Thank you so much for the spectacular time you guys!  I'll be coming back for sure!< /Text>

Came from Florida for my friends wedding. Wanted to do some surfing while I was here. Found these guys and couldn’t be more happy! The waves were amazing and they did an amazing job to make sure we had a good time. The crew is awesome and the prices are so reasonable. I would totally surf with them again next time I come out here. Check em out!< /text>

<Review>Had a 1,5 hour private class(me and my husband)with Carl at the end of July and it was AWESOME!!!We had SO much fun, and Carl was great teaching us how to surf for the first time! Everyone at Kapowui was so great! It’s definitely THE happy place where you need to spend time surfing, when in LA! Hope to see Kapowui family again very soon!!!</Review>< user_id>

I had a 1.5 hour 8 AM lesson with Ed. He was great! We covered the various parts of a surfboard and their purpose, why exactly we were going to be surfing where we were, how to get to the surfer pose, and the safety aspects of surfing. All of this was one-on-one and done at a pace that covered everything thoroughly and left plenty of time in the water.

I felt that Ed is genuinely happy to see his students do well. He celebrated along with me when I rode my first wave! I can't recommend Kapowui highly enough!< /review>

I as an avid snowboarder, I had been wanting to try surfing for some time to see if my snow legs could convert to the waves. Sure enough, with a lesson from Carl and a perfect ocean, I was able to get up on the waves! Kapowui provided me with an AMAZING first experience! I’ll be renting a board and suit in the near future with my new found skills :)<//Review>

My sister and I had a great surfing experience with Carl. Being beginners it can be very intimidating. Carl shared his knowledge of surfing and made us feel comfortable in the ocean. We even got the chance to see some dolphins and seals. Highly recommend!<//Review>

<Text>My boyfriend and I had the best experience with Kapowui Surf Club. Our instructor Ryan made it an easy and fun experience for the both of us by giving us personalized tips and assistance throughout our lesson. I was a little nervous going into the lesson since I don't have much experience, but Ryan helped me to feel safe and encouraged the entire time by pushing me over the big waves and guiding me every step of the way. Overall, we had an amazing time and could not stop smiling throughout our lesson.<//Text><Pics>None< /Pics><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

<review>This was my first time surfing, I’m from the east coast (Michigan) so I never had a chance to surf. My first time surfing was exhausting but very fun, the instructor (Todd) seemed very knowledgeable and specific. He even tweaked the lesson so it’d fit me more. All in all very cool experience, great teachers.<//review>< pics>

He was very friendly and got us going quickly. We both managed to ride a few good waves all the way to the beach during our two hour lesson. Don't settle for anything less than two hours; you'd be doing yourself a disservice. And make sure you're a decent swimmer! Surfing is a workout! Thanks so much Leon for your support. You made a dream of ours come true.<//Text>< Pics>

I’ve had lessons with Thierry, Garret, Haylee, and Todd and all of them were great instructors and really nice people. Even when conditions weren’t very good they managed to salvage good surf lessons and still get me practicing and standing up. They’re also all helpful with things like reading tide, waves, etc so that I’ll be able to practice myself and be far better off than without their lessons. Always early/on time, equipment is good, highly recommend them if you’re looking for surf lessons in the LA area.<//text>

{'time': 1595555946889, 'text': 'I\'ve written this 3 time but google keeps censoring my reply so here\'s one last attemp without saying where the virus originated, maybe this one will not be censored.\n\nNot quite sure why your panties are in a wad. Where did the virus come from? What did the media call it in the beginning? So was I wrong to call it what they did? Amazing at how people forget these things and would rather be politically correct. So when I was refunding you, I only stated a fact and referenced the name the media was calling it at the time. The Media said that chXnxx was the source of the virus so my refund message to you I put in the information that was the available to me. I should have had the foresight to call it covid long before scientist came up with the name, I guess I\'m just not that clever.  I\'m sorry me referencing the origin of the virus offended you. I hope this helps you better understand my frame of my mind.\n\nOh and BTW, I will not allow you to reschedule with us. . And as far as your statement " DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS", I don\'t capitulate to cancel culture and snowflakes. And anyone who is offended by facts should not book a lesson with us because I only speak the truth....well for as long as freedom of speech is still a right. It would appear censorship is alive and well. Welcome to the Orwellian dystopia.\n\nJust to let you know I was deeply depressed and frustrated by having my rights stripped away, my business shut down and being stuck inside my small apartment for months on end. I felt like my whole life was falling apart. My business which I have put my blood, sweat, and tears into for 15 years was dead and I was stressing out about it shutting down forever and surfing is know so my future seemed so dead. 2020 was the year planed on buying a house and possibly retiring and after the STAY AT HOME order, my whole future seemed lost. I am a social animal, an out doorsman and a waterman and all that was taken away from me. FYI I also I have a compromised immune system and I\'m 51, so I was hyper worried about the possibly of catching the virus and possibly dying. Also being a surfer, drowning is my greatest fear and as we know those who are seriously affected basically drown in their own fluids. Seeing my country that I so love and served for being decimated, seeing the world fall into choas and all because of a cover up. So No, renaming the virus will change it\'s origin.\n\nPerhaps you should direct your angst and frustration for the global implications due to a cover up that has cost trillions of dollars, put millions of small business out of business forever, countless people suffering, lost homes, lost jobs, tens of thousands of people dead and dying, the families that have to morn their loss, etc, etc, etc..... But no wait.... you did your part! You wrote a bad review! now you are a true activist you have stood up for... what? CPP narrative, the far left, and censorship,....  YAAYYYYY!!!! Go celebrate yourself. Sheepeople like you disgust me. Get a life.'}< /Response>

Will was friendly, knowledgeable, and encouraging. Every interaction with anyone in the company was 5 star. I would HIGHLY recommend them for your surfing needs!</Text>

My experience was once in a lifetime! I was a first time surfer and I thought the teaching process was great for someone with little experience. I had Clay as an instructor who was super nice and encouraging and I would highly recommend trying surfing with them. Location was great and the waves and water were beautiful!!! 10/10!</review>

Kapowui is a great company to learn how to surf with. Awesome vibe, cool personalities, and lots of knowledge. Ryan specifically was great to learn with. Explained the concepts well and made sure you had a ton of fun. Highly recommend!<//Text>

My friend and I had a great private lesson with Nofar. She was very good and taught us a lot in the lesson. Perhaps the most surprising thing about the class was the nice wet suits they loan you. They are a much better quality than you typically get when you rent wet suits, and keep you much warmer in the water. We were in the water for an hour and I didn't even feel the cold at all.< /text>

My 5 year old son did a lesson with 2 of his friends with Carl from kapowui. Carl was seriously the best with the kids, they had such a great time and my son was standing and surfing first go on the board. My son wasn’t the biggest fan of the beach before this lesson but really took to surfing and is begging me for more lessons. Thanks so much Carl and the Kapowui team. We will see u guys again really soon!</review>

Our experience with Kapowui for my kiddo's first time surfing today was outstanding. All the folks we interacted with were really nice and friendly. The instruction was thorough and easy to understand. Todd was great! He was easy going and let things roll at his pace. Great 1 on 1 teaching and patience. The waves were really rough and he helped him get out beyond the breakers, which was pretty challenging. I would highly recommend Kapowui and Todd.< /review>

<Review>Being from the east coast we don't get to do much surfing over here, which is why I had to book a lesson while on vacation in Santa Monica. Ruben (my instructor) and the whole staff were super chill. The coolest people I met during my whole trip. Ruben showed me the ropes and had me up and riding waves point break style in no time. One last thing, Pay for the GO Pro package!!!, its such a surreal moment you're going to watch it over and over again.</Review></record>

Awesome experience! My 2-hour lesson with Colston couldn’t have gone better. As an instructor, he is attentive and meticulous with feedback.

Would definitely recommend to anyone of any skill level!<//Review>

We've just finished a lesson with Todd. We're all complete beginners but Todd was really patient with us and prepared us really well on the beach before we went out onto the waves. We all had so much fun and all the staff were lovely. We'd all definitely recommend Kapowui!<//review>

My first time surfing and Dylan prepared us very well for our time on the waves. We loved building our confidence with the lessons on the beach and had such a blast catching waves to shore a few times! He was very kind and careful, gave us great instructions! Would def recommend these guys to anyone!<//Text>

Kapowui surf school is super welcoming, friendly, and helpful. There's been detailed instructions before the class and plenty of reminders to help me not forget to set an alarm lol. When we got to the beach, their van is really easy to find.
Our instructor Colston was very knowledeable, and provides really helpful and detailed instructions. In order to help us catch a wave, he kept moving along the beach to find nice and easy waves, and also exchanged some bigger surf boards so it was easier to maintain balance. Eventually my friend and I both caught a wave by the end of the lesson! It was really fun and we're definitely down to surf again.< /Text>

Had a great time at Kapowui Surf School! My friend and I had never surfed before and were both standing and riding waves by the end of our 2 hour lesson. Ed was our instructor and he was fantastic! Explained everything well and clearly and really emphasized having fun. A wonderful experience all around.</text>

My friend and I did a 2 hour surf session yesterday morning with Will and it was amazing! We had so much fun. It was my first time surfing and Will did a great job of making me feel comfortable! All of the employees were so kind to us and they even gave us a souvenir keychain of the Kapowui Bus. One of the South African instructors let us borrow his organic sunscreen too. We highly recommend this company to anyone looking to catch some gnarly waves!!!<//review>

Went to Venice Beach today with the intention of taking surf lessons for the first time. Walked up to the bus and asked if I could take some and they hooked me up with two other first timers and Ryan had us all catching waves in no time! It was exactly the experience I was hoping for. Great lessons, great conditions, great time!<//Text>

<review>WOW. There aren't enough words to portray how AWESOME of a time this was! The best time of my life, so exhilarating, and left me feeling incredible. Leon was so courteous and understanding- he's a PHENOMENAL teacher and took such good care of me and my partner. It was our first time surfing and Leon made us feel like pros. I genuinely loved it and instantly wanted to book another lesson. Everyone at Kapowui was so nice and made us feel instantly like apart of their surfer family. Loved it loved it loved it! Thank you Leon, and THANK YOU KAPOWUI for making our first time surfing not only the highlight of our trip to LA, but the one of the best times in our entire lives!< /review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Kapowui is awesome!!!!! Being a first time surfer in California Nofar had me up on day one. It’s been a awesome experience. She has taught me to find waves, how to catch waves and the right techniques to standing up and balancing. I will definitely surf with Kapowui when I come back to California!!</Text>

Spent 2 hours out in the water with Todd, couldn’t have asked for a better instructor. The entire staff are very welcoming and personable. I highly recommend this place if you plan on getting surfing lessons!</review>

< Review>
My husband, 22 year old daughter and 16 year old son had a beginner surf lesson with Ryan on July 24,  2019.  It was a highlight of our California vacation!  After a tutorial on the beach they headed into the water. Ryan was there with them the whole time and worked with each of them alternately.   They had the best time!<//Review>

My surf lesson was an awesome experience. Nofar was a very encouraging and motivational instructor, and had me up riding waves within 3 attempts. I recommend Kapowui to anyone looking to get into surfing, try something out of their comfort zone, or even just to experience the one-of-a-kind feeling.< /text>

Hope there is a Kapiwui Surf Club as well!

Carl, our instructor for the beginner 1.5 hr lesson was fantastic! He spent the right time on the fundamentals in the beginning. He helped us navigate the waves and pushed us out so we could learn when the timing was right. Whole staff was super professional and friendly! Planning on taking another lesson here and would recommend this place to everyone.< /text>

Overall, the instructor was attentive and clear. This was a private lesson for 2 people who had never surfed before for 2 hours. We went early enough that we weren't really competing for space in the water, which made the first half of the experience good. In the second hour another instructor with 4 or 5 people joined us and it felt a bit crowded. The other instructor was barking out orders at his group, drill sergeant style. The experience felt authentic, though when we returned to the van, the instructor was rushed into his next lesson, which didn't feel personable at all. He was told to get some water and we hand shook and were sent off. He was good and knew how to act/what to say when the waves were rough to keep us calm. When I booked the lesson, I took the time to review each instructor, and chose the specific one I wanted, on purpose. I chose Lulu and wanted to surf with her, but when we got there, it was somebody else, without warning. He was good, though not what I paid the $220 for. If you go, go early, and don't bet 100% that you will get the instructor you've chosen, if you took the time to do your research.</text>

{'time': 1535918542060, 'text': "Sonya, as to your 1st issue, about there being to many people in the water, we are allowed  by the city to do our lessons in a specific permitted Zone so we and there are many sand bars, rips, swimmers,  and other hazards the instructor has to take into account to insure your are in the safest and best area. Issue 2, barking instructor,  each instructor has his own teaching style. Issue 3, lesson finishing and you not thinking it was personable,  we book our lessons back to back especially in the summer on a Saturday , so the instructors can maximize their income for the year since this is a seasonal job and they have 5 months to make their money for the year. I'm not sure what you expected your instructor to do after the lesson was over. Each instructor has multiple jobs requirements other than just doing lessons, so getting water is necessary so we can clean wet suits between lessons. We have had multiple instructors quit recently due to burn out and I should have been at the beach to help out but I had my own issues. Issue 4,  you not getting the instructor you booked online, Lulu quit so there was no way for you to get her, and as it clearly states on my website you are not guaranteed the instructor you book online. Sounds like the instructors did everything they were suppose to do.  I'm sorry we didn't meet your expectations. It's reviews like this that really bum me out."}< /response>

<Review>Booked a 2 hour surf lesson with Travis on Friday the 3rd of May. Never been surfing before so I was a little bit nervous but needn't have been.
The guys could not have been more welcoming and my instructor Travis could not have been more helpful and engaged.
The surf lesson started off with a pod of dolphins swimming close off shore and just got better from there.
Travis had me standing up on my first wave on my second attempt and I had just an awesome time for the next 2 hours.
My only regret was I left this lesson till the last day of my holiday. If I had a few more days I would have been back.
Would recommend Kapowui to anyone looking to learn how to surf and get some of that Californian surfing spirit.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

Kapowui is an excellent place to learn how to surf. The instructors are incredibly positive and willing to share their passion for surfing with you, which makes for a great experience. They are also great at explaining and helping you to focus on the fundamentals that will help you to catch awesome waves, and do an amazing job of making you feel safe in the water, even if the surf is rough.

Shout out to Todd for being an awesome instructor. I enjoyed my lesson so much that I immediately scheduled a follow-up. I can't wait to learn more about surfing with Kapowui!</Text>

Incredible experience with The Kapowui gang!! Had a 90min lesson with Travis who improved my knowledge and helped improve my skill set so much!! Had a group session booked for the next day but since it was all beginners they called up Clay and he showed up (even tho he had the morning off to sleep in!) and he came to do a private lesson with me so we could work going down the line. Clay and Travis were both very kind and knowledgeable. Martin, the owner made sure my quick weekend trip was full of waves, fun and a super chill staff to hang with. Super easy to find the adorable vans in front of the beach and they set you all up. All the staff asked numerous times if I had any additional questions or anything else I wanted to try. Extremely helpful and I learned SO much! Uber will drop you off right in front of the vans, like a 50ft walk. I’ll be going back any time I’m in Venice for sure! Can’t say enough great things about the Kapowui crew! Go catch some waves!</review>

This was my second time with Kapowui and it was as good as the first time. First time I had Nofar and this time I had Clay. Both had helped me a lot with learning about the wave and catching the wave. They answered every one of my question and explained things in details. Phenomenal place for people who want to learn how to surf.</Text>

<Time>1563429046627<//Time><rate>5<//rate><Review>Booking my lesson online was just as smooth as everything else that followed - finding the location, meeting our instructor Carl, learning the fundamentals of surfing, wiping out and having fun! There is parking exactly in the area where the “VAN” is set up and if you come during the week it’s even easier to find a parking spot. I originally booked for a morning appointment but our instructor, Carl, text early and if we could come at 1 in the afternoon because wave conditions would be more favorable.  I totally appreciated that and agreed.  Full body wetsuits were provided and we even opted for to GoPro recordings. Carl was with my 15 year old son and I one on one every time and made us both feel very safe and knowledgeable.  I am utterly fearful of water, but Carl completely helped me conquer that very quickly.
I highly recommend these guys!< /Review>< Pictures>

Carl is amazing ! I’ve taken lessons twice before in different parts of the world but was having trouble popping up consistently. Carl taught me in a different way than both past instructors did and it worked ! I missed my first two waves but made every single other one for my 1.5hr lesson 😎<//Review>

BEST first surf lesson!! I found Kapowui because I googled "best surf lessons Santa Monica" and am so glad that I found Kapowui. I chose Kapowui over the other options based on previous testimonials and reviews. The website made it clear that the Kapowui team is truly dedicated to the experience that their clients have. The instructors were extremely welcoming and outgoing. After my lesson I decided to schedule one more for the following day because I had so much fun. Thanks for the great experience, Kapowui, keep doing what you're doing!< /text>

I get a 2hour lesson from Haylee and she was the best teacher I ever had. I used to know how to swim and had learned water skiing and snorkeling before, but I still was a bit nervous about surfing because it was my first time. But Haylee explained surfing in detail and easily so that I could understand without difficulty. She also gave me a lot of encouragement and praise so I could relax and adjust to surfing quickly. If anyone is afraid of surfing, but has a desire to learn, I would definitely recommend Haylee!</text>

All the guys were super friendly and Raymond, my instructor, knew what he was doing and he helped me a lot. After getting a wetsuit and board we spent about half an hour on the sand going through the basics of the board, standing, tips, etc. We spent the rest of the lesson in the water. At first Raymond helped me to catch waves by pushing the board but I was soon able to paddle, catch and ride a wave by myself. I had a good time. I’m going back tomorrow to take my wife for her lesson. I highly recommend Kapowui.<//Text>

<Text>Kapowui was one of the best experiences I've had with a business, everyone I spoke to made me feel welcome. Took my first ever surf lesson with Ruben, and could not recommend him enough. Would also recommend the GoPro package.

I took the 2 hour lesson, which felt like a perfect length. I thought I might spend quite a bit of time on the beach going over the basics, but Ruben got me in the water and on waves super quickly.

Every time I fell, he'd point out one thing to try and focus on for the next run, and it would make such a difference each time. We would tackle simpler waves to nail down the new points, and every now and again he'd throw me more of a challenge, which usually resulted in me falling over but that's how you learn. By the end of the session, was standing up the whole way to the sand, even if i was a little wobbly. I've always wanted to try surfing, and could not stop smiling all morning.

It's very clear Martin (the owner) takes great care in choosing all his instructors, you'll have a fantastic experience with any of them.< /Text><Response>{'time': 1562181962046, 'text': 'Thank you so much Kevin for taking the time and writing this review for us we really do appreciate it!\nIt was a real pleasure having you come for the lesson with us\nAnd we really hope to have you come surfing with us again 🙏🤙'}</Response></record>

I signed myself and two of my good friends up for a group surfing lesson (Kapowui does group lessons at discounted rates!) and I am so glad I chose them. First of all, they have the coolest surfer van with rentable surfboards and wetsuits of varying sizes for everyone, and the parking was not difficult nor expensive at the time that we went (early morning on Sunday).

I was the only true beginner at the lesson, my two girlfriends had surfed before in the past, but both of them said afterwards that the instruction was very enlightening and made it that much better and easier to surf with success; they learned a lot. All three of us were standing on our boards and able to surf toward the shore on some whitewashes in no time :) Todd was our awesome teacher and he spent the first 30 minutes of our 2 hour session just explaining basic physics of the board and ideal positioning and technique to get up on the board, and then the full 1.5 remaining hours we were just in the water. I really appreciated his sincere and supportive attitude as a teacher! We also met Martin and his chill Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and both he and Todd just had the best vibes. Good people.

If you want to learn to surf I couldn’t give you a stronger recommendation to go with them! They are the best and I am so inspired to keep at it :) thank you Kapowui 🙏🏻<//Text>

I signed up with Leon for myself and my two girls age 14 and 9  to try out surfing for the very first time. With not much expectation and nerves setting in , Leon managed to keep us calm and motivated for the lesson. We then did a very helpful 30 min beach lesson about the correct techniques of surfing and once we had that down we were out in the water and within the first few waves we were all up and surfing.

This was an experience that we will never forget with a very big thanks to Kapowui and Leon for being so kind and enthusiastic throughout the lesson.

We will surely be back next year!</review>< pictures>

What an amazing experience. Mother Nature held up her end of the bargain, Carl did the rest. Couldn’t have been a smoother day at the beach. Parking is super easy, but make sure to get there early. Also don’t forget to say hi to Lilly, their resident mascot and adorable Cavalier King Charles puppy. Highly recommend.<//Text>

Had a lesson today with Lulu and she was a fantastic surf instructor!  We had ages 16 through 55 in our group and she got us all up and surfing in one lesson which was no small achievement on her part. The other instructors were also very friendly and it seems like a great family of dedicated surfers!  Would very highly recommend Kapowui to anyone looking for surf lessons.<//text>

Quick intro to safety, the board and form. Our instructor, Will, was very helpful out in the water and gave feedback.
Had a great time out there caught some gnarly waves.

Great company, great experience!
My first time learning to surf was a great experience. The folks at Kapowui are well organized, great with communication, and very professional. I booked with them, showed up at the correct time, and they took care of  all the rest.
My instructor was Juan. I was riding waves after my 3rd try, thanks to his help. I had a ton of fun, and took home memories that i will treasure forever.
If you're looking to surf in LA, look no farther. You've found it!

I enjoyed a lot! It was my first time and it’s kinda important - thought I ruined my preparations, as spent a magical night before at Ty Segall show and had a just renter car towed - the idea to still make my first lesson at 7am was the best idea! Will is 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👍🏻💕💕💕<//Text>

Incredible experience!  Ruben was a fantastic teacher (and person)!  The Kapowui team couldn't be nicer.  We learned the basics on the beach, then safely hit the waves.  We got to surf with dolphins...DOLPHINS!</Text>

<Text>Had a great time with Kapowui.  Ruben took us out and was by far the best surf instructor I have ever had.  He was very fun and patient and provided clear explainations and insights for any questions.

<Rate>5</Rate><Text>Kapowui instructor Colston was an energetic competent instructor who managed to get our 15 yr.old son up on the waves surfing in no time.
We just walked up and asked if he could teach our son to surf and he had no other booked lessons at the time and was eager and willing to help us out. Our son had a private lesson for 1.5 hours with Colston and is was very affordable (cheaper than Disneyland).
Colston was easy to chat with and knowledgeable about surfing. Our son had a great time and is wanting to surf more. Unfortunately, we are from Alberta, Canada so his surfing dreams will have to wait until we come back again.
Thanks Colston and Kapowui Surfing for a great afternoon at the beach riding the waves!<//Text>< Pics>

<Text>My brother and I had a fantastic time on Sunday learning to surf with Kapowui! We found them based off of their reviews and booked our appointment with Martin in the morning on Sunday. Come 10am, we were with Juan who had to be the best and most energetic instructor we could have found! Juan taught us from the basics on the beach into how to ride a wave in the water! Got both of us up on the boards surfing within a short span of time! Excellent customer service from Martin, Juan, and everybody else here.

We had the 9am Group surf lesson on a Sunday. I expected a full parking lot but it wasnt packed at all. Plenty of room to park in the morning but it does get more crowded later on in the day. Our instructor Todd was an awesome person very knowledgable and big on safety. If your looking for surf lessons no matter what experience you are these guys are the ones!< /Text>

We received a one hour couple's lesson with Travis as a birthday gift. It was really fun and we got all the kit we needed. Within half an hour we were standing on our surf boards despite this being our first time! Thank you so much and thanks for making our trip to LA memorable!<//Review>

<rate>5<//rate><review>Today, Juan taught me and my boyfriend how to surf. Our friend Hailee recommended us to Kapowui and Juan, and she told us that he would be patient, nice and fun. Juan went above and beyond to provide us with a good first surfing experience that was safe, fun and memorable. Definitely try out Kapowui and ask for Juan!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><Gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9<//Gmap_id></record>

I had a great time catching some waves with Todd this morning. Thanks to Todd for breaking everything down in an easy to understand way and ensuring it was a safe and fun experience. I couldn’t have had a better instructor. Also thanks to Hailee for pointing me in the right direction! I definately plan on returning for more lessons.<//review>

Kapowui was awesome! We arrived early, so they pointed out some things to see before lessons. We got back a few minutes late (why does walking back always take longer?) so they got right to work!  The surf was very rough and Todd let us know that surfing would likely be difficult. However,  everyone got to ride a wave or two and all had a super time!! Thanks so much- and we will be back again some day!!</review>

Our instructor Leon was incredible. He explained everything carefully on the beach before heading into the water. When we were in the water, he stayed next to us to help us catch the best waves, told us what to do, and gave us a push - all while swimming. He is very experienced and helped us have a fun and safe time.</Review>

I found kapowui surf lessons on google and I'm really glad I did because as soon as I took the first lesson I instantly fell in love with the company.  Venice beach is a  great spot for beginners but also people who want to improve on their surfing skills which was my case. I surfed for seven days with my instructor, Clay, he helped me improve tremendously and I really  enjoyed surfing with him. He's a very fun guy to be around with and he was very patient with me . I definitely recommend Clay and this company to other people and I'm sure you will enjoy it just as much as I did! I will definitely be back next summer. YEWWW<//text>

Colston walked me through everything and was so great that I was able to get up on the 5th try and had such a great time. i highly recommend kapowui for newbies and experienced surfers, i’d definitely come back!<//review>< pictures>

<review>Carl is the greatest surf instructor; his patience, knowledge, skills, and sense of humor made our experience perfect! He even surfed a wave per my request. Overall, the team is a ragtag bunch of young hot guys and one bitchin’ tough chic from Israel! Don’t go anywhere else to learn surfing it to VW buses in the parking lot on Venice Beach!< /review>< Pictures>

I'm an absolute beginner and my instructor, Gregory G-Force, did a great job of breaking everything down so that I was standing up in no time.  If you're looking for instructors that can get you surfing Kapowui is the place.</Review>

Carl was very knowledgeable and catered to everyone’s experience in the 6 person group class I was in. Carl taught everyone the basics on the beach and then helped everyone in the water and ensured they got to ride multiple waves. Top tier equipment rental included in the lesson. 10/10 experience for a first time surfer 🤙<//text>

Really liked my experience at Kapowui.
Very nice staff, lacking a bit of organisation but overall good. I would recommend the 1h30 lesson if you’re beginning, 1h is too short.</review>

Carl is the absolute best! He was a wonderful instructor and with his help and guidance I was able to catch most of the waves I went for! Would definitely recommend!<//review>

Awesome Experience! Came out for business for a few days and decided to take surf lessons (first time surfers) on a day off and it was hands down the BEST thing about LA! Jeremy was a great teacher, knowledgeable, fun, and cheered each wave~when we come back we know where to go! Thanks for a great time!<//Review>

<review>I had a two hours surfing lesson with Leon - a very attentive, smart and talented instructor. In the first 20 minutes he thoroughly and patiently explained me the theory of surfing, and then he was a supportive teacher who helped me to catch big waves of Venice Beach.  With him beside me, I had no fear of diving under the more than 1,5 m high waves. Having never surfed before, just after one lesson I know how to stand on the board, how to catch the wave, and I surely would repeat this great experience and would like to make surfing my hobby. Would highly recommend Kapowui and Leon as an instructor.< /review>< response>

Was in town for college visits, so I stopped by to get a surfing lesson. Nofar is incredible, honestly one of the funniest and helpful instructors out there. She helped me get up, ride those ‘big’ waves, and find a new passion in surfing even though I definitely messed up more than a few times.

I’ll definitely come surf again when I’m in Cali. Hopefully I’ll do better next time 🤙🏽 Mahalo, Kapowui!< /review>

<Text>As a couple we had an awesome time with Leon for our first surf lesson. We both managed to stand most waves from the beginning, with Leon taking care that we tried proper waves for a beginner. In the beginning he made sure that we get to speed by pushing us into the waves while swimming himself. It was a great experience and we never felt unsafe, even with quite big waves during high tide.<//Text>< Pics>

<text>What can I say about Kapowui? I can say that I will always recommend  them to ANYONE looking to try their hand at surfing. Todd was beyond amazing. Made us feel comfortable, zero intimidation, and very informative. If this is a dream of yours, you can certainly book with confidence when it comes to Kapowui.</text><pics>None</pics>< rate>

<text>The instructor with the blonde hair and blue eyes who told us from she was from another country. Compared me to another on the group lesson saying I wasn't as flexible as my counterpart and later yelled at me the whole entire lesson in the water stating I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do so it made it more mentally challenging while I observed the other instructors not yelling at their customers wishing to be in their group.  I was disappointed because this was the one activity in Santa Monica, California I was looking forward to doing....learning to surf.< /text>< Pics>

<Resp>{'time': 1564574871639, 'text': "Hi Venessa, this is Martin the owner of kapowui. I'm very sorry and disappointed that you left feeling this way. I really wish you would have talked to me before you left and then I could have addressed your issues in person. Your instructor, Nofar thought you loved your lessons, because you seemed so happy and stood up so much, she was actually shocked that you left with out leaving a tip that's how certain she was  you had a great time.  I've talked to Nofar and found out what happened. As far as comparing you to the other person in your lessons, it was not to make you feel uncomfortable it was just stating facts and  explaining to you why you were learning a different techinque than the other guy in your lesson. Because you were less flexible than the guy so she had to personalize your pop up technique to accommodate your inflexibility and body type. She did this so you would have a chance of standing up, and it worked, you stood up multiple times. Just to let you know there are many ways to teach a the pop up, one way does not work for all people, so we match the technique to the individual, otherwise only 50% of our lessons would stand up compared to 100%.  As far as yelling at you in the lesson, Nofar would never do that in a mean way. What you have to realize is she's trying to give you feedback on every wave so you can progress and learn as much as possible in the short time we have with you. So every time she pushes you in a wave she watches you till you fall so she can give you feed back on what you did wrong and she needs to do this immediately before she forgets what and this must be done over cacophony of crashing and breaking waves. So you are right she was yelling, but only so you could hear her, not because was mad, frustrated, or disappointed in you. I hope this helps you understand more about what transpired during your lesson and ease any disappointment you have felt. Perhaps now with this new knowledge and understand you can look back with fond memories of your lesson. I'm not going to ask you to change your review but now that you have a better understanding of what happened I hope you reconsider your review score. Lastly I'm really bummed out you left feeling this way, if you are ever back in town stop by and I'll talk to you in person and we'll see what we can do to make your next lesson live up to your expectations. Sincerely Martin."}</Resp>< gmap_id>

Had my first surfing lesson with Raymond, coolest experience of my life, I even was able to ride several waves under his guidance. If you ever head down to Venice and want to surf, get some lessons from Raymond. He is a real cool dude that will make sure you are having a good time and will get you riding those waves in no time. Thanks again dudes it was awesome!<//Text>

290 reviews at this time at an average of 5 stars. And for good reason. Every one of the instructors I interacted with was over the top friendly, and my personal instructor, Ryan, did an incredible job making sure I was trying waves that were within my comfort zone and tried to push me further every time I got on the board. I’ve had the impression that some surfers can be a bit snobby about the sport, and these guys weren’t in any way.  I can’t compare it to any other surf schools, because this is the only one I’ve done and the only one I’ll ever need. I’ll definitely be renting a board from them again in the near future until I get comfortable enough to buy my own. There’s no doubt these guys will get you up and surfing. I cannot recommend them enough.</text>

Can't compare to other schools but would not hesitate to recommend.
Had a no show due to illness so they adjusted the charge to reflect the smaller group, so thoroughly decent chaps as well !!< /text>< name>

I brought my three children for surf-lessons. The instructors are amazing! They were patient and helpful. My middles daughter was the only one full-throttle the whole time. The rest of us we sort of wet blankets, but they encouraged us anyway. Next time, I will look into some sort of daily lesson for my daughter. I will definitely try again as well. We were all very motivated by the experience and the fantastic instructors.  This is a fantastic company!< /review>

Had my first ever surf lesson with Clay and another one with Jonny a couple days later and it was awesome!
Both of them are just fantastic surf instructors! They were so patient, funny and cool and got me to ride several waves under their guidance.
From the beginning it felt like they had taken me into their surfing family – I had such a good time and it sure was one of the coolest experiences! I'm still stoked thinking about it:)
If you ever want to surf in Venice, get some lessons at Kapowui!
And if you’re ever down to Cape town in the future reach out for Jonny!

Thanks again boys for your patience and your coolness, you are awesome!< /Text><resp>None</resp><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPVyUsECacCpj5gjjcODjlPJNIzpvLTWEBRmzdw=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pics><rating>5< /rating></record>

Kapowui was awesome! I had DYLAN and he was unreal! He was super clear with instructions about the steps to help get you up and surfing in no time, but also all about safety! Choose Kapowui and you will be very pleased!!!< /review>

There is a reason why these guys have 5 stars. Mark was a great instructor - he tailored the lesson around the way I move and helped me improve really quickly. Martin went out of his way to find a slot that worked for my tight schedule in LA. Great experience. The dolphins were a nice touch too! :-)</text>

Had a great time out on the water today with Jay. Very easy to learn from, very patient, and a great guy.
The staff as a whole made us feel very welcomed as soon as we got there & at the end, made sure to ask us how our lesson was.
The owner himself was also very nice - made sure to introduce himself to everyone who came to get lessons.
Would 100% recommend Kapowui to anyone. 🤙<//text>

My wife and I booked a last minute lesson in the afternoon and they were extremely accommodating. Our lesson was with Raymond, who was awesome. Super chill guy and helped us both out so much on our first ever surf lesson. We absolutely will recommend Kapowui to all of our friends and will book again when we are in the area. Thanks again Raymond.<//Review>

I had a great experience with Kapowui. Martin and Juan were both super welcoming and enthusiastic when I arrived. I took a lesson with Juan, who was amazing! He was really patient and very supportive. His thorough and clear lesson beforehand was so great I was able to stand up on the first try. His notes and adjustment suggestions were really helpful for becoming more comfortable on the surf board.<//review>

Also very skilled teachers, nice equipment and easy to get to.
I really appreciated that Martin (aka. Kapowui) helped me and my friend out with our bikes - we had forgotten our lock to the bikes at home so he went home to get HIS own lock and lent it to us!!! That's service! And of course thanks to Todd for his patience with us and for being such a great teacher that we at least in the end could catch a wave! If I ever come back to Venice, I'll definitely go back to learn more cause it was so much fun! (So if you want to learn how to surf when in Venice - this is the place! Worth every penny!!)<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< response>

Garett was an amazing instructor! He is extremely encouraging and genuinely seemed to care and be proud of my efforts. This was my first time surfing and I managed to ride a wave all the way in after a few tries even with my poor balance skills. You are in good hands with Garett and Kapowi in SM! Thank you!!!< /Text>

He was awesome, tailoring his instruction to each of our abilities. He made us feel comfortable and safe and we had an absolute blast with all of us catching waves by the end. We are going back today to rent boards for a short follow up session to continue our journey in surfing. Cannot say enough good things about Kapowui in general and Ruden in particular.

I caught a wave! I've always wanted to surf but this was first surf lesson ever in 47 years.

My instructor, Nofar, was incredible.

Not just an extremely pleasant human to be around, she was very attentive to my needs in adjustments so I could successfully catch a wave.

They give you all the gear, lessons, encouragement, and celebration you need.

I think they got more excited for me when I got up and rode the wave than I did.

Great crew. Great gear. Great experience.

Highly recommend and if you can get Nofar, I'd advise it. She's just awesome!<//text>

My boyfriend and I just finished two 2-hour lessons with Mike.  Truly enjoyed every second of the experience. We were both catching waves the whole entire time thanks to a mini beach lesson beforehand and instruction in the water as well. Mike was a very knowledgeable and energetic instructor. He taught the basics, then let me determine how much I wanted to do and what else I wanted to learn. Easy guy to talk to and provided me with as much information, hints, and helpful reminders as possible. You can tell his passion for surfing and it came out while he was teaching. Highly recommend!!!</Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Kapowui surf did an amazing job! We had a part of 8 and they were very accommodating and returned inquiries quickly. When out in the water the instructors were very organized and fun! I would definitely recommend Kupowui to anyone who is looking for surfing instruction in the Venice Beach area!< /text>

I had an exceptional experience learning to surf for the first time with Kapowui! They were very supportive and their fun-loving attitude definitely helped to feel confident and welcomed on the waves. The customer service was excellent and I felt like I received the attention I needed to make the most out of my session. I even got a little token memento to remember the experience! if you're looking to learn to surf for the first time, or just need to rent a board, I recommend Kapowui 100%.<//review>

My friend and I had our surf lesson with Will Ermish and with Elliot assisting.
I've had surf lessons in Bali before and this was by far the best lesson I've experienced.
Will was friendly and fun and his explanations clear and concise. We were taught technique and safety before heading into the water.
It was cold in the water that day and Will and Elliot were really patient and helpful.
We had so much fun, made good progress and more importantly I felt safe at all times. I've had a few scares before and getting back in the water with instructors whom I trust and felt safe with helped my confidence a lot.
We really enjoyed it! Thanks guys!</Text>

First time surfing and it was awesome. 30 min or so of pop up training and learning about the board and safety things. Our instructor, Jeremie, was great and helped us a lot. The instructor is always out there with you and he lets you know when to get up and basically starts you off before you get up on the board. This was the best experience I’ve had and would recommend it to anyone wanting to try surfing for the first time.< /Text>

Words cannot begin to describe how cool and memorable my experience with Kapowui has been! If you are looking for a genuinely fun and potentially life changing experience in Southern California, this is your place!

I live in the middle of Europe, with the closest beach an 8 hour drive from my home, so surfing ocean waves is a HUGE step out of the comfort zone for me. Despite having no experience whatsoever with any board sports, no knowledge of waves or anything remotely related to surfing, my instructor, Will had me catching several cool waves and riding them all the way to the beach within about 40 minutes of arriving at the beach!

We started with a beach lesson where I was shown what to do, proper technique, and given safety advice, and then we headed into the water. After a couple of falls, I started catching waves really fast. The instructor stands with you in the water and helps catch your first waves, gives pointers on what to do different next time to improve, so it is a quick learning curve and very very gratifying. Having had zero previous experience, it was an unbelievably cool feeling to be able to stand up and ride a wave so quickly.

I was hooked instantly, so actually went back for a second lesson during my short stay in LA. I really recommend you do that too, as the second time your body already has some memory of this new activity and the experience is even more gratifying! I was catching waves with more confidence the second time!

All the guys I met at Kapowui, Will, my awesome instructor, Martin, the owner, and the other instructors too, everyone was super friendly and nice. They are also very flexible with scheduling your lesson, and actually recommend the best time on that particular day, checking tides, etc.

Anytime I am in LA in the future, I will be there at the beach catching waves with these guys! You got a new lifetime customer, and what is even cooler, a new fan of surfing! <3

One more note about why I wrote “potentially life-changing experience” above. It truly has been that for me. Surfing for the first time last week with Will turned out to be a huge lesson on my own fitness level (actually, lack thereof), my ability to face setbacks and my fears (getting washed out by a huge wave is terrifying at first… and then you cope with it…because you have to - how many times do you get to practice that within a one-hour timeframe?). These two sessions with Kapowui have actually opened up my mind and heart to several new goals to work toward in life… an unexpected, but very welcome bonus not mentioned on Kapowui’s website. :)

Thank you soooo much guys, I will be back! :)

P.S.: one more thing… a day after my lesson I sat at the beach looking at a bunch of guys trying surfing for the first time, being instructed by someone obviously not trained to do so (probably a friend or volunteer). They caught exactly zero waves in the one hour or so, and left tired but frustrated by the experience. As I mentioned, I have zero knowledge of surfing, yet even I could tell from a distance that they were sitting at the wrong spot in the water, and not shown properly what to do and when. They should have saved themselves the frustration and get a lesson with Kapowui instead! :)

See you Kapowui, very soon! <3<//Text>

Surfing was on the bucket list so my girlfriend and I researched the best place to take lessons within 20 miles of Marina Del Rey. Kapowui had the best reviews online so we booked two, 2 hour lessons on a weekend. The hype going in didn't disappoint because I don't know how we could have had a better experience!

Mike was awesome from start to finish. We were able to get up by the end of day one (which was a blast to do), and by the end of day 2 we were both paddling and getting up on our own. It was just what we were looking for! Mike knew exactly how and when to push us to continue getting better and having fun. And he was a solid guy!

After two days, I'm hooked! We're both going out this week to buy our own boards to keep up the new hobby!< /text><pictures>None<//pictures>< resp>

Had a two hour lesson with Jeremie and it was amazing. He was patient, always gave good feedback and was well worth the money. He was able to push each person to progress at their own pace and we were very pleased. We intend to do it again soon. So glad that we found them.<//text>

Having never done any board sport before, I was a bit nervous about trying to surf, but after reading tons of positive reviews I decided to go for it. And let me tell you, I'm beyond glad I did. Taking a surf lesson with Jay was one of the best experiences I could possibly recommend to anyone in the area looking to learn to surf, and really just enjoy themselves on the water. The lot was really easy to find, especially with the VW buses right by the entrance. Throughout the lesson, Jay was super genuine and friendly, and really helpful- giving feedback on every wave for how to do better on the next one. I had a great time, and I'll absolutely return for another lesson the next time I'm in town.</review>

<Review>I'd never surfed in my life, I'm really glad that I chose them to give it a try for the first time. Todd was a great instructor, flexible, concerned about my security and with the right attitude all the time. Can't describe the feeling of catching a wave on my own for the first time. Thanks a lot Kapowui family!< /Review>< pictures>

A really cool Team!
My Instructor Ryan was more than Professional!
It was like surfing with a friend!
Payment is also easy as shopping;)
Cash, Card or your Blood!😉
No worries, the Guys are very cool.
They aren’t wasting any time with stupid stuff.
only the most important things at the Beach , everything else in the Water!

Perfect !!!!!

Mahalo & Thanks from Germany

Awesome lesson, great time and a super positive experience! Ask for Gregory a.k.a ‘G-force’ who is an amazing instructor and got someone who had never surfed before to stand up on his board and actually surf in an hour and a half.</Review>

Just had a lesson with Will at Kapowui Surf Club and absolutely loved it. Will was both personable and helpful. The lesson was very thorough and started with instruction on technique and safety on the beach before heading out into the water. I had a blast and felt like I improved in only the hour I spent in the water. I would definitely take a lesson again and would recommend it to anyone who has an interest in learning to surf.< /text>

< review>
I had an awesome experience with my private lesson with Kapowui. I didn't pick a particular instructor and trusted them to pair me with the best one based on my experience for my lesson. I worked with Leon for 2 hours and it was amazing, we joked that we should just book another 4 to keep going! As I had surfed before and was moving onto green waves (unbroken) I was super stoked to have a 1:1 and conquer the next phase. Leon's instructions were clear and his coaching was very encouraging. We did a lot of laughing, hanging, and catching waves and it was exactly what I needed. I was definitely bummed to see the 2hours end. He's among my top 2 surf instructors/experiences to date. Highly recommend.<//review>

My teenage boys learned quickly from him and he even got my daughter(who's terrified of the ocean) to give it a try.  She ended up LOVING it and kept going back to catch more waves.  I highly recommend Kapowui Surf Lessons for you and your family!</review>< pics>

Such great guys! We called from 5 minutes away and they still made time for us. Will was so patient with our "somewhat tough" 12 yr old and my 17 yr old had an instant connection. His instructions were clear and his sense of humor was infectious! He kept things light, uplifting, and positive from beginning to end which is rare in any style of coaching. They were both up on their boards in no time. Luke and Tucker will remember California surfing from a true surfer forever! Thanks for playing such a great part in our trip from Alabama!<//Review>

<Review>I had friends visiting from out of town and five of us took a lesson for the first time with Kapowui and it was a great experience!! We had a lot of fun and even though the tide was a little rough we all got up on some pretty sweet waves! The instructors were all super friendly, helpful, and patient with us. Gear was all in good condition. I would definitely consider going back for more lessons and would recommend it to anyone considering taking a lesson! :)<//Review><Date>1487228967804<//Date><userid>106350098698635876581</userid><pics>None< /pics><resp>{'time': 1487782546936, 'text': "Hi Fraces, Thank you for taking the time to write a review, it helps my business and helps me with quality control.

<date>1528399034456</date><rating>5</rating><Review>We wanted to do something special for my grandsons when they visited from the Atlanta area. We thought they would really enjoy the surfing experience so I searched the internet and kept coming up with great reviews on Kapoui. I started corresponding with Martin, the owner, to build the best experience for the boys. He set us up with Todd for morning and afternoon lessons. The entire process and lessons went great. Todd was the perfect instructor for them. He was friendly, outgoing, patient and gave them a  surfing experience that they will always remember. Both boys was thrilled and talked about it all night.  Martin ensured that everything exactly as planned.

I would highly recommend Kapowui to anyone looking for that first time surfing experience. And if you are in the LA area and what to give you child or grandchild a memorable experience surfing with Kapoui is the place to go. I have to say that Todd was an outstanding instructor and we would use him again durning the boy's next visit.  However, while there I had to opportunity to see the other instructors in action and they all were extremely qualified.< /Review>< Pics>

My 11 and 13 year old kids took a 90 minute lesson with Todd. They had an excellent time. The vans are easy to find at the parking lot. The staff greeted us and got the kids into wet suits and onto the sand quickly. If we have time they want to do another lesson before we leave LA. That says it all.</text>

<text>I actually didn't take the lessons, but I did use the rental service to get a paddle board! I have never experienced such a friendly, affordable, and laid back rental company. Martin was so cool! He helped us understand how to stand up on the board, launch past the shore in to steadier water, and gave me a piece of mind about safety. He was so great and I would absolutely recommend him and his company to everyone I know! Thanks for such a great experience :)<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

<Text>My wife and I just took a 90 mins stand up paddle board lesson with Greg and loved every minute of it.  We had never paddle boarded before and the conditions were not exactly ideal for beginners - choppy and windy!!
Greg was clear in his instruction and set our expectations perfectly. He got us up and boarding in no time and made it a really fun activity.
Whether it’s your first time or a refresher lesson, Greg is an excellent instructor and a really good guy to hang out with on the water.
Kapowui and Greg are your “go-tos” in LA.<//Text><response>None</response><Rating>5</Rating>< Time>

I’m 13, and I had such a great time here. All the staff especially Todd and Martin are so welcoming and kind. They will have you standing and comfortable on your board in no time. I had two consecutive lessons with Todd, and he was great. If you are interested in learning to surf or have already surfed elsewhere this is the place for you.</review>

We were a mix of surfers - from absolutely no experience to having surfed a handful of times -and the format fit our needs perfectly.  The on land instruction gave even those of us that had surfed before a little extra insight into the how and why of what we were doing, and once we got in the water all of us had a blast being pushed into and catching our own waves.

He was incredible and we all had a blast while learning to surf. My husband was skeptical of surfing and was afraid he wouldn’t get the hang of it. By his second try, he was surfing all the way to the shore. The Kapowui family was amazing and we all loved our time with Kapowui.

Juan was an amazing instructor.  It was my first time surfing and it was seriously so much fun.  I recommend at least a 2 hour lesson so you get plenty of time in the water.  I went w a friend and we had a blast. a If you’re in West LA, don’t miss out on an unforgettable experience!</Review>

<text>Had a 2-hr lesson today with Todd for our family of four. Couldn't have asked for a better experience! Todd was awesome - patient, encouraging, relaxed, thorough. Kids and adults had a blast and everyone was able to get up at least once and ride a wave!! Location is also nice as it isn't a crowded section of Venice. We would come back to Kapowui, and Todd, in a second. He even had tokens for each of us when we were finished and I know the kids especially will cherish theirs!</text>< gmapID>

Had a fantastic time today learning to surf with Ryan from Kapowui. Very knowledgeable and awesome team. Only positive vibes, lots of laugh and fun. Ryan payed attention to every step I did, so I stood up on the board right away. Couldn't expect better service!!! Ill be back once im in LA! :) thanks guys!< /review>

First time surfing and the waves were larger than expected, and extra challenging. My instructor (Jay) kept cool the whole time ensuring I was confident and still managed to get me up and riding. 10/10 would recommend these guys!</Text>

I’m a Venice local of over 10 years and have tried several summers to learn how to surf properly without success.
I finally booked a lesson on a whim and Ryan’s easy to understand and spot on instructions made it click finally. I had a great time, felt really encouraged, empowered, and supported. I also felt safe and looked after despite the conditions being very intense in the ocean today. I felt like I learned more today than in all the years before combined.
What a friggin’ blast!
Cant wait to see the GoPro videos and book another lesson.< /Text>

Not only did we have a blast, he made sure we knew all of the tips and tricks to making our first time the best and most fun as possible. We came out of the water feeling super accomplished and so happy we picked them to help us check something off our bucket list that we've been wanting to try for a long time. We will be back soon and will head directly back to the guys at Kapowui. Highly recommend. You won't regret it.Thanks guys!!< /Review>< pictures>

Great bunch of hard working instructors who are professional and willing to see you succeed! You get the full experience and if you lucky enough get to see the dolphins swim by at the same time! I recommend Kapowui from start to finish. They teach you the functioning of the board as well as the pop up technique and safety while being in the ocean. You feel like they help you to adapt to the ocean and the waves! Great team and alot of effort put in by the owner Martin! Be sure to let Lily the dog give you a high paw five!

I booked a 1.5 hour lesson with Lulu and it was awesome! She was very encouraging and patient throughout the lesson and helped me feel more confident on the board. She also went through all the techniques you should use to surf was a lot more thorough than previous lessons I've had with other schools and I was finally able to stand up!
Thanks Lulu!<//text>

<Review>I had my first ever surf lesson with Juan at Kapowui just hours ago and it was amazing!!! Despite the fact that I managed to get a bloody nose and twisted ankle (no one's fault, life happens!), I had SO much fun! Juan was patient and kind. He was always checking in with me and encouraging me. I really appreciated his energy, even with my challenges. As Martin said to me after the lesson, I got my surf injuries out of the way early! :) I was super close to being able to stand up and I will definitely be back in a couple of weeks for another lesson. Mahalo for your time and patience with this newbie, Juan!< /Review>< user_id>

Had an awesome time surfing in Venice with Juan. When Kapowui princess Hailee recommended I check em out, I became curious and decided to give them a shot. Juan was a very down to earth, patient, and knowledgeable instructor. He gave me plenty of feedback to help up my game. Looking forward to my next class!<//review>

I had a 2 hour lesson with Will. He was great at explaining surfing techniques, tricks and safety. He showed great patience and enthusiasm throughout the lesson, and supported me during my first ever surfing attempt. Their set-up is super chill, and meeting them in the parking lot is convenient. I plan to do more lessons with Kapowui.< /text>

My friends and me had our first surf lesson with Lulu on our last day in LA, and we couldn't ask for anything better!
Lulu was amazing, full of energy and especially really patient with us.

Super fun session with Will this morning. Less than ideal conditions and we managed to find some really fun rides. I've been surfing for 3 years and he left me with just the right amount of pointers to work on. Highly recommended for a beginner or intermediate surfer looking to get more waves and have more fun out on the water. Stoked to get out for my next wave! #vanlife</Text>

Best part of our trip!!!!!!! (And our trip had lots of cool stuff!) We took 5 boys to learn to surf and couldn't be more pleased with the reservation process (accommodating, easy), instructor (in my son's words "#bestever")...will shout out to Jeremy because he took extra special care of our littlest guy while being completely attentive to the rest.  We loved him!  We even came back for a second lesson, two days later...that's how great this company is!  Thanks!</Review>

One of the best decisions I made while visiting Venice Beach. Awesome name with awesome people. Marty and Kenny were both friendly and helpful! I wanted to learn how to surf for the first time and was kind of hesitant to go with an instructor from one of the other equipment rental shops. While walking along the front walk, my eye caught this beautiful orange van in a parking lot, stacked with colored boards.

I met Marty who explained to us that since the weather was suboptimal that morning, he would be robbing us of money if he gave us a lesson. Instead he proposed a day and time when he knew the ocean would be more forgiving and offered to take us then. I really appreciated Marty's integrity. I set up two lessons with Kenny, one of Marty's instructors whom I had the pleasure of meeting.  He was very friendly and gave us valuable instruction and trooped through some pretty rough waves to teach my buddy and I. This guy is top notch. My buddy caught waves on the first day and I caught quite a few more on the next, when the waters were a little lighter. Kapowui had great equipment, and Marty let us use his GoPro to take some awesome videos!

My trip to Venice Beach was made amazing thanks to Marty and Kenny. I highly recommend Kapowui!< /text>

The staff was super helpful and patient. They ensured my husband and I caught multiple waves and even let us stay a little longer due to the low number of waves during our session. They are well worth the money in my opinion. We had an unforgettable experience.</Review>

I am in my late 50s and my son is in his 20s. We signed up for lessons at Kapowui with Lulu and figured he would get up but not sure if I would. Well, not only did we both get up but son was able to catch a wave on his own a few times! Lulu was always positive and full of encouragement no matter how our ride went. I really liked how she prepped us for the surf on land and that she tirelessly pushed me into the waves so I could catch them. We had so much fun we are going to take another lesson next week. What a fantastic intro to surfing:)</Text>

I have been meaning to write this for a while, because these people are so incredible and have given me the greatest gift - SURFING!

I started going to Kapowui in August and I have since started venturing out on my own (thanks to how much I learned from taking lessons here), however I find an excuse to go back and visit the Kapowui folks pretty much EVERY weekend because they are so great.  Martin is the absolute best, along with every one of the instructors working at Kapowui, and I have surfed with pretty much everyone!  They are SO passionate about surfing, and care very much about equipping you with the skills and training that you need to excel at the sport.  They will always be honest with you about the conditions, and whether or not they work well with your skill level.  Not to mention, everyone that works here has encyclopedic knowledge about surfing.

I cannot thank Martin and everyone at Kapowui enough for all the time they have spent with me, both in the water, but also answering all of my surf related questions, and generally just being supportive of me as a surfer newbie.

I also want to say that I have taken lessons at other surf schools in the area, and no one has held a candle to the level of passion and commitment and thoroughness that I have seen at Kapowui. Whether you have never surfed before, or you are a beginner/intermediate surfer looking to get some extra instruction and improve your skill set, or maybe just looking to rent a board and suit- GO HERE.  You will not be disappointed!</Text>

<text>Booked lessons for our 7 and 9 year old boys with Nofar and Ryan, who were fantastic.  Nofar was patient with our 7 year old, and went to get him an extra wetsuit when he was cold and a boogey board when he got tired (but only after encouraging him to finish strong by getting up three more times).  Ryan had our 9 year old up early and often and quickly got him out deeper for bigger waves and longer rides—he worked tirelessly and was very enthusiastic.  Both boys had big smiles on their faces.  Would definitely recommend these instructors.</text></record>

<Text>This was my first surf lesson, and I couldn't be happier. The owner and instructors are very friendly and happy to share their passion for surfing with you. My instructor was Mark. Thank you Mark!!! He gave me an education about the board, the waves, the ocean's energy, safety, and more. There is something magical about your first off balance, unstable, "what am I doing" wave. When you nail your first ride....WOOOOHOOOOOO!!!! This will not be a one and done event for me. Kapowui Surf made my first experience educational, memorable, and happy. Definitely a 5 Star rating from me!!! ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐</Text>< pictures>

<Text>If you want the best surfing experience in all of southern california...these are the guys you want to teach you! Not only are they the most experienced, they are fun!!! They will get you up the first time guaranteed! I have been surfing with them since last summer, and every single time I go out, not only do I get better...but I learn something new, and the fun just never stops. All of the coaches are simply amazing and will guide you through step by step. They are professional and courteous and will not only make memories of a lifetime...but friends for life. I'm hooked for life, and couldn't recommend a better school for anyone looking to learn or get better or simply just learn what being in the flow is all about!! 10 stars!!

He spent ample time walking me thru my board and body mechanics before hitting the water. Harry was absolutely the best, basically putting me right on the waves over and over again. Thr dolphins came out to play with us and it was just super chill. Harry refused to leave until I got a ride all the way in which I did and now i'm hooked. Thanks Kapowui and mega gratitude to my main man Harry. I highly recommend making a reservation with Harry.<//text><gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9< /gmap_id>< Rating>

< Review>
I have done surfing several times before, but i wanted both my cousins who are 11 to try it too! It was amazing that from the very firsts lesson with Nofar, they both managed to stand up on their surf boards and ride a wave until the shore. Moreover, they both loved it so much that we returned two days later. Nofar is such a gentle and kind spirit who was so understanding! We were stuck on the highway in a traffic jam and contacted her that we will be late 30 mins. She told us she is waiting for us, and moreover, she extended our surfing time. She is so kind and such a good teacher. Her technique was suitable for our whole family! We cant wait to come back!<//Review>

<review>I took a lesson with Juan on a little time off between jobs. I have been in LA 9 years and surfing in the Pacific has been on my bucket list. He was an awesome instructor! It was an amazing experience and I know it has lead to a hobby for life! I can't recommend kapowui enough! Do yourself a favor and book lesson!< /review>< pics>

I booked a 2 hour lesson on my last day vacationing in California. I have never surfed before, so I was really nervous, but the whole team was super warm and welcoming as soon as I arrived. My instructor Todd was awesome and kept me laughing the whole time. I even stood up on my second try! Thank you Todd, it was an unforgettable experience and I can't wait to surf again!</review>

Kapowui what to say, it was just amazing. I took my first lesson with Nick, and he totally guided me at the begining to the end, it was so cool, he gave the best advise for beginner, and also help me a lot to start, surfing wasn't so tough with him haha, i had just such a great time, it was 100% of fun. You are in the perfect hands with Nick and with Kapowui !! GO</text>

First time surfers, had a blast!  We were lucky enough to get Jeremie as an instructor, he was friendly, experienced, chill and has great teaching technique.  I really appreciated his no-nonsense instruction:  we were out on the water quicker than I anticipated and our 2-hour (2-people) lesson was non-stop fun!!  I didn't think I would get up in the first hour, but was standing up on my second wave!  The instruction and lesson  felt safe, which added to confidence and thus made for a great time with no stress.   I know that people may hesitate on the price (all the surf schools are about the same cost, btw) but when you think a night out with a bottle of wine and a really nice meal costs about the same.  This was a great deal more fun and we will certainly remember it much longer than a meal out, so dollars well spent!  We felt so good afterwards and spent the rest of the afternoon walking around Venice and back to the Pier.  I would recommend Kapowui for a spectacular experience to anyone.  Travel tip:  take the Expo Train out to Santa Monica and walk down Ocean Front.  It wasn't much longer than driving from downtown LA (45 minutes) and saves $$ for parking as well as the environment :)<//Text>

More times than I'd like to admit, I've received service from people with a ton of personality, only to realize they became too comfortable, taking liberties with the way they treated my business. Ex: The tailor you hit it off with, but starts delaying your alterations because he confused your kindness with his cousin's.

It's a shame when you find people with genuine personalities that fail at what you came to see them for.

Jeremie and Martin at Kapowui are able to balance professionalism and great personalities.

If you want to learn how to surf and feel like writing a five star review after you're done, this is the place.</Text>

They not only effortlessly teach you the technicals, they convey in every possible way what one must do physically and mentally and dare I say spiritually to get up on a wave.

We originally had a groupon reserved. A day before he backed out because of a “swell”. Sure enough we still saw people out there surfing. So we called these guys up and they happily make a next day reservation for a surf lesson! It ended up being awesome and our instructor Juan was knowledgeable and very helpful!<//text>

{'time': 1495364839436, 'text': "Sonya, thank you for taking the time to write us a review! When I first read your review I got so upset to hear about your 1st lesson last year. I only hire the best instructors and train them extensively to be even better. I had to get to the bottom of why you didn't learn much your 1st lesson.I looked through my records to see who did your 1st lesson. His name is Raymond. He is a very good instructors so It didn't make sence.  I did further research to check the condition during your 1st lesson on July 3rd 2016 and that's when I discovered the problem. The surf was HUGE your 1st lesson. When the surf is big it is always going to be much more challenging for the student and the instructor. I take  full responsibility for you not learning much your 1st lesson because I drill it into the instructors head,when the conditions are challenging, the instructors #1 job is to keep the student safe. So I  apologize that you didn't learn much.  Here is a cut and paste of the conditions Last summer\n\nPOSTED: 07/02/16, 8:08 AM PDT\nLOS ANGELES >> Elevated surf and strong rip currents are expected Monday along the coast, creating hazards for swimmers, surfers and boaters on this Independence Day, National Weather Service forecasters said.\n\nSurf of 3 to 5 feet is expected, reaching 7 feet at some south- and southwest-facing beaches, and a beach hazards statement, which is one level less serious than a high surf advisory, will be in effect in Los Angeles County through Monday afternoon and in Orange County through Monday night.\n\nI believe the conditions where the problem with your 1st lesson more so than the instructor. Thank you for giving  us a second chance to redeem your confidence.  I truly appreciate your repeat business and I'm happy you had a good time at your 2nd lesson and plan on coming back. Thank you again,  Martin"}< /Response>
<gmap_id>0x80c2a4c65d2f432b:0x3aaffb088afffde9</gmap_id><review>I had two lessons in this school. In the first time, I was taught by a tutor (I can't remember his name) , together with another two girls. The tutor didn't teach me very well. However, my second tutor (his name is Will Ermish) was so so so good. He was very patient and nice. That's why I had big progress in that lesson. I stood up on the board many times. I think I will definitely do more lessons in Kapowui this summer.< /review><rate>5</rate><UserId.>111788464371902761258</UserId.></record>

My sons and I wanted to end our West USA roadtrip by surfing at the iconic Venice beach. Although rookies on the board (2 lessons 1year ago doesn't really count:-)...) Alex managed to get us catching some nice waves quickly! Very patient and helpful guy, especially with kids! We had a GREAT time! Would recommand to anyone to pass by their nice-looking VW's, getting geared up and hitting those waves... We'll surely come back on our next roadtrip!</Review>

Totally rude and unprofessional! Would never recommend this company or surf guys. Wouldn’t answer any questions about surfboard rentals, where to find them, how much, etc. said they don’t know wave conditions or surf info and just to show up to find out rental info. Showed up within the hours he quoted only to find out they closed early and left. Major dbag!</text>

{'time': 1570383976672, 'text': "So I'm rude and unprofessional because I didn't give you the answers you were looking for? Perhaps you are  a lazy, entitled and assumptive millennial. We are very busy EVERY day, and it so happens when you called I was extremely busy (I had 2 calls on hold and I was getting multiple groups ready for their surf lessons). So when I get calls asking for information that can be found on our website, I tell people to refer to it. All the information you wanted ( prices, location, surf conditions, etc.) could be found on my website with a modicum of effort. So you assume since it's Sunday and you are not busy or working that no one else is or that your wants must be accommodated, wrong. Also Surf conditions are constantly changing and are subject to the surfers ability. So any information I may have given you would be subject to change and dependent upon your skill level.  And as I stated before I was super busy and  i didn't have time to ask the 10 questions it would have taken to get the answers from you  that I would have needed to steer you in the right direction. And I've found after 14 years in business 99.9% of the people over estimate there ability, so it's usually a waste of time to ask the questions in the 1st place. Furthermore, I was working full speed from 5am to 10am so I didn't have time to check the conditions myself all morning, so I didn't have the answer to that question and I wasn't going to lie to you just to get you to come in and do a rental. You never asked for the hours over the phone, that's a lie!, and negates everything you said as far as I'm concerned. And exactly why did you come to my surf school wanting to give me your business, if I was that rude to you over the phone? There are literally a 100 other places to rent from. I would never make any effort to give my hard earned money or business to a rude, unprofessional, Dbag. Looking for a fight I assume. So when you showed up and I told you we were closing in 3 hours. That's because our primary business is surf lessons not rentals, and this is the Fall/ October, so we don't stay at the beach all day like we do during the summer.  Had you asked over the phone I would have told you we were closing early to save you the trip or had you asked  I could have referred you to another place that specializes in rentals. We are not a corporate franchise that has set hours, we are a family business that is open when we have lessons or enough rentals to cover our overhead. Your request for a 4 hour rental would cost me money to stay open due to my overhead. The hours on my google maps are subject to change daily and is determined by our surf lesson schedule. The 6am-6pm is our availability for calls, not rentals or lessons. However, there is no way to delineate this on google maps. So now you know. And now, just as you were, I'm going to be assumptive, but I'm a very good judge of charterer, so here goes.  I still remember your face when came to the van in a huff looking for a problem, I knew something was off (I think you already had this review written and you came looking for any reason to post it, because 10 seconds after you left, I got a notification of the review). When you showed up, you didn't say we had spoken to on the phone. You are young, tall, muscular, very handsome dude and I'm sure everything comes easy for you, maybe that's why you feel entitled. However you need to realize the world doesn't owe you what you want, (even something as simple as answers to your questions) usually you have to work for it, so stop crying when you don't get it. Perhaps in the future you can think out side your feelings and instead of wasting energy writing bad reviews, you can use your time to do a google search and find the 2 other surf shops 50 feet next to me, walk over to them, rent, and have a fun day surfing, but nooo, it's more important to let people know you weren't treated special. Have I now answered all of your questions?\nHave a life, Major Dbag."}<//Response>

I decided to take a surfing lesson at Kapowui after looking at numerous surfing school around the Venice area. My instructor, Todd, was amazing. He made it easy to learn the technique and basics. I was able to catch my first wave 10 minutes after getting in the water. I'll certainly come back for more lessons. The instructors are professional and highly knowledgeable. I would definitely recommend this place if anyone wants to give surfing a try.</text>

I would recommend them to anyone. Instructors take their time with you and ensure your comfortable. They sit out in the water with you and help you catch that wave. Staff was great. Equipment was in good condition not extremely weathered and beat up. Parking is easy as they are in the parking lot. Overall great experience< /Text>

If you're reading this review trying to figure out where to book your surf lesson - save yourself some time and just book with Kapowui. I've taken both group and private lessons with Jeremie and Leon....both were out of this world. Kapowui is a business that reminds me of the good in the world.< /text>

I had an amazing time with kapowui! I had Dylan as my surfinstructor, he was really nice. He gave me critique and tips after every wave i caught (or didn’t) so i could learn from my mistakes. And he also gave me compliments and was very excited when i did catch a wave. Overall it was a great experience and i really recommend the kapowui surflessons :)) and i hope to be back one day!< /Review>

But since we can't control mother nature, we work with it, and you were an absolute rock star during some real tough conditions!!! My hat is off to you for being such a trooper.

Nothing went according to plan with the weather : 5 Beaufort winds, waves way too high, rain and mist but despite all that Will masterfully walked me through it all and even got me standing on the board.

After 2 hours (1.5 in the water) I'm knackered but delighted with the experience from Kapowui (super helpful on the phone and a smooth booking experience)  and the lesson I got from Will. If I'm back next year I'm going back there! Thanks guys!< /Text>

My wife and I had a great lesson with Will.  He suggested a better time when we made our appointment due to the upcoming conditions and he was spot on.  He spent time with us on shore before we got in the water and we were both able to get up on a few waves after just a few tries.  They have a great team, the equipment was in great shape and I would highly recommend them to anyone looking to pick up surfing.<//review>

<review>Great outfit. Juan took our family of 4 first-timers out for 1.5 hours and we had a great time. I'm not the most comfortable in the water, but they were so encouraging and instructive that I felt at ease and learned a lot. We would for sure go back. Kapowui will be our go-to when in Venice Beach.< /review>< GmapID>

<text>Our 2 hour surf lesson was the highlight of the trip! The 4 of us went in with zero surf experience but our instructor Jeremie was amazing and got everyone up on their boards. Jeremie was tons of fun, professional, and really encouraging. The rest of the team we met or had contact with were friendly and professional. Would highly reccomend. We would have booked a second lesson if we weren't leaving the next day. Huge thank you to Jeremie and the Kapowui team!!<//text>< resp>

<rating>5</rating><Text>Absolutely stellar. I had never so much as stood on a surfboard before, and I was skeptical about whether I would dig it. One 2 hour lesson with Lulu, and I was not only standing up, but catching loads of waves! These people not only know what they are doing, but they are passionate about it. Everyone here I talked to was super cool, and extremely encouraging to  a total newcomer. It's been only 4 days since my lesson here, and I'm already hustling to buy a board and a wetsuit. I am officially a surfing acolyte now, largely thanks to Kapowui, and especially Lulu. Big shoutout to you Lulu!!

I will be referring every visiting friend with a dream to surf to Kapowui.

It was my first time surfing and I will definitely be back! Jeremie was a great teacher, he's patient, supportive, and he gives a good push! The surf lesson here was the highlight of my trip.<//Review>

< Review>
Ive taken lessons at vacation spots but my lesson at home in venice with carl of kapowui was the best surf experience ive ever had. Marty and carl didnt just help me have a great session, but they provided me with the information to continue to learn and progress on my own. With their input i now know what kind of board i want to buy and have a plan to get more experience. I have no doubt ill be checking back in for another lesson after ive done some more practicing. I strongly recommend signing up for a great surf lesson.</Review>

I had a great experience with Kapowui - Todd was an excellent instructor! He was able to read my skill level and push me further accordingly. With his instructions I was up on the first wave, and advanced to a slightly thinner board by the end of the lesson. Todd was not short on enthusiasm for surfing and I would recommend these guys to anyone interested in learning.< /text>

My girlfriend and I decided to take lessons and we went with Kapowui because of all the good reviews and I'm glad I made the decision. We were able to learn the basics of surfing within an hour and a half. The owner was super nice and our instructor Raymond was patient and engaged with our learning. Great group of guys at Kapowui 👍🏻👍🏻< /Review>

If you are looking for the BEST instructor and surf lessons you need to request Jonny at Kapowui ! My daughter had a 2 hour lesson today and it was a GREAT experience and the highlight of our trip to LA.  She had never surfed before and he had her up right from the start of the lesson and surfing all the way into shore. If we were in town longer we would have definitely signed up for more lessons. His positive energy and enthusiasm is contagious. THANK YOU JONNY!!!!!!< /Review>

Awesome! Best surf place to get lessons. Take 2h. It is worthy. Much fun, the team is great and welcoming. We had Juan who is a great teacher. And after that, you can rent material from them. Which we will do. Just go and book already. Come with your good vibes and all will be just fun and good times.</review>

Friendly, patient, and helpful staff! My husband and I had the best time learning to surf with Todd! We have never surfed before and he was a great teacher! If you want to learn a lot and have an awesome time doing it, I would most definitely recommend Kapowui!< /Text>

Was in Venice on holiday and saw there cool VW can and decided to swing by and take a lesson (never surfed before). They were all very friendly and I was given a time directly with an instructor named Corry. He had me up and surfing the waves within half an hour. An absolute legend!!! Can't recommend this company enough and Corry! However the other instructors seem awesome as well seriously knowledgeable and friendly.  I ended up booking 3 more lessons with Corry and would have done more if it wasn't for the fact that I'm going home. Booking a trip here next year for surfing!< /text>

They say you find a way to make a living doing what you love. If this is not a manifestation of that very ideal, I don't know what is. I genuinely forgot that any part of this experience was a business transaction (we literally could recall if we had paid by the end of the session). My husband and my son were first time surfers and the team really cared about that. Their demonstrated awareness of conditions, assertiveness of their clients and overall enthusiasm has made us lifelong members.

Learning to surf with Mike was like sharing life experience with a cousin you had not seen since childhood. The entire staff made us feel like family. I don't think that I could put a fair price on the experience that Mike and the rest of the Kapowui staff gave us as first time surfers. I may even venture to say that we made new friends. There is a valid reason for this company to have achieved five stars across the board...it is a rarity.

Mike, thanks for going the extra mile to warm our little munchkin up to the water. You are an awesome person, instructor and surfer...

Your husband and son were truly some of the best people I have ever met, you are a very lucky woman. I loved you husband and sons zest for life and their smiles were infectious. YOU are what gives me hope for the future and YOU are what keeps us going and makes all of our lives so full and blessed. Thank you from the deepest recesses of all our hearts. Please come back any time to hang out with your surfer family, you will always be welcome with open arms.

It was my first time surfing and I felt like Kapowui was with me every step of the way to make my experience as great and rewarding as possible. I'm looking forward to my next lesson with Greg and the rest of the Kapowui team!</Review>

This was definitely one of the highlights on our trip! I've always wanted to learn how to surf and we really choosed the perfect company for our first surf lesson. Our instructor and the other we met from the team were super kind and very professional! I'm so excited to learn more about surfing and when I return to Venice I will absolutely go back to Kapowui to take some more lessons. I really recommend them to everyone, they were really dedicated and you will have the best time!<//Text>

I grew up in the water but never got a chance to surf. I had an early morning lesson with Dylan and from the first wave I was hooked. I work with athletes for a living and I wish I had a team of coaches like Dylan. First thing when I got back to my hotel was book another lesson before I fly out of LA - thank you heaps!<//text>

<Review>5 stars, hands down! I've lived in LA for 10+ years and never learned to surf because I was afraid of the water and didn't know what I was doing. Kapowui surf school came through!! Martin was super accommodating to my friend and I. We booked at the last minute and added my friend on the same day. Communication around the lesson was great as was the instruction itself. Juan was our instructor - not only was he helpful and knowledgeable but he's suuuper fun! He'll make you laugh while working with you on your technique. He helped us feel comfortable in water and after spending a couple hours with him, you can't help but feel a nice bond to the strong guy with the big heart who keeps you safe in the water and guarantees you'd catch a wave or two. Cheers to the best surfing school in LA - these guys are spectacular.<//Review>< name>

This is possibly the best surf school in Venice Beach! A place with great vibes and lots of smiles. The instructors are one big and tightly knit family with many years of surf experience. There is an instructor that fits any learning style and personality. My instructor Eduwardo was the best!  He is the most kind, patient, and thorough; it was my first lesson ever and I felt very safe and assured at all times. The pricing is fair and everything is practically included; just bring a towel and your game. Kapowui's mission is to spread the passion for surfing as well as having a great time.</Review>

<Review>Highly recommended for beginners! Will is a great instructor, making you feel comfortable during the entire lesson and making sure you have fun while you do it. I started surfing within 15 minutes of the lesson so if I can do it, anyone can. Thanks Will and team for a great lesson!</Review>< pics>

Wow! What an experience! I was scared of wave but Clay was really patient with me. Also the owner of the business (didn't catch his name) came by and tried to make this experience enjoyable for me. No wonder this place has 5 start rating. I would go on and on about how great these guys are but lots other people did that already and they are true. Even though i got defeated by waves, I would love to go back and try again. Price is really good as well; all the gears and the work instructors put in and the experience, worth it. Do it.<//Text>

<user_id>102546857415187669707< /user_id><review>If I could give these guys more than 5 stars I would!  I took a lesson here while visiting LA last week and cannot recommend them enough.  They were helpful when I texted them with questions ahead of time (on thanksgiving even!).
This review is going to be long, because I have so many good things to say!
The instructors we met were very friendly and welcoming as we got set up.  Raymond did our lesson, and explained everything clearly and gave us tips and pointers on our form before we even got into the water.  Once we started surfing he set us up for each wave, making sure our timing and speed was right so we could focus on popping up and balancing properly.  He gave us feedback on every wave, and both of us (first time surfers) were able to catch several waves by the end of the lesson.  We could see other lessons from Kapowui happening around us, and it seemed like the other lessons were equally successful. I have heard friends and family try other surfing schools who have given up after fruitless classes, and Kapowui made our experience completely the opposite.
We enjoyed the lesson so much that we went back to rent equipment from them a few days later.  Martin the owner was incredibly helpful; when we weren't sure if we should rent or take another lesson, he suggested we rent and if we changed our minds he would count our rental fee towards the lesson.  Martin was out surfing while we were, and gave us a bunch of pointers even though he had no obligation to.  It is clear he and all the Kapowui instructors are so passionate about surfing and teaching, and the joy they bring to it changes the lives of everyone who passes through.
You have converted two new surfers Kapowui! We are already planning our next trip back to venice to surf with you guys.  Thank you so much for sharing your passion!< /review>< Gmap_id>

I took my first surf lesson with Jay on 2/16/2017. He was a really cool laid back instructor who got me up on my first try. I would highly recommend Kapowui Surf Lessons to anyone visiting the area that wants to learn how to surf. Awesome experience!</Text>

I spent 2 weeks in Santa Monica and Venice and wanted to rent surboards and wetsuits with my friends, the Kapowui surf school is definitively the best choice !
The staff is awesome and very flexible, their van is parked just a few meters from the ocean in Venice with very nice waves around :)
They also gave us perfect advices about the surf conditions!
Once back in Venice I will definitively come back !!<//Review>

We had the best time at this surf school! My husband and I decided to try out surfing for the very first time, and it was truly the highlight of our summer! Big Thanks to Leon Egen our awesome instructor for being so positive and patient with us during our time there as well as the rest of the kapowui crew for being so accommodating.

We are very sad to leave but will surely be back soon!</review>

Got up on the board within the first hour!!

Unbelievable. My ten year old son and I  (I am 45 year old woman) took surf lessons from Jeremie yesterday- neither of us have ever been on a board at all!

I can’t tell you how Fun it was and how surprised we were that we could actually do it!!

All thanks to Jeremie- he was kind, patient, he made us laugh and relax.

Do it. Take lessons. It’s great fun!!</review>

These guys are awesome! Not only super friendly but they can explain you a lot of small important things, like, for example, what to do so you don't hit yourself or others with the board.
Many thanks to Clay!</Text>

My girlfriend and me were on a USA Roadtrip this Summer. On this trip we wanted to take our very first surf lesson, but we didn't manage to make reservations beforehand. So we thought this dream had to die.
But right before we left LA, we spontaneously stopped by at Kapowui Surf Lessons and although they were all booked out, they somehow made it possible for us to get our private lessons - instantly. This saved our day!
The instructor was very nice and really took his time explaining everything we needed to know. The lesson was very well structured and fun.
Even though it was my first time on a surfboard I managed to stand up on the board and ride the waves without falling down a couple times.
I don't remember the price, but I remember it to be very fair!
Definetely one of our trip's Highlights!</text>

there is a reason why there are so many 5 star ratings for this surf club.  you don't have to know A THING about surfing and you will be treated not only as an equal but with the utmost respect.  in addition, you WILL be surfing by the end of your lesson.  the change in people's energies after they come back from a lesson is moving, not to get sappy, but it's like nothing i've ever seen.  do yourself a favor.  OH and if you can find others to do a group lesson with you the rate decreases with each additional guest so there's that too!<//Text>

All the instructors care so much about Kapowui, this business is the common bond and gives all of us misfits a purpose in additions to a surrogate family. And we are all determined to make it the best we can, one lesson at a time. Plus reviews, mentioning a specific instructor, gives them bragging rights for the day and they get to be King or Queen for the day. Once again Thank you. Martin"}< /resp>

I had improved hugely by the end of my 2 hour lesson and of course had to go back to improve even further. I highly recommend kapowui especially if you have not surfed before.<//text>< Pictures>

I visited California from Canada, and these lessons were absolutely amazing. Definitely worth the price. Me and my brother got to stand up on the board within our first waves, and youre pretty much guaranteed. Andy who was our instructor was absolutely amazing, and the owner was nice as well. We also got some cool souvenirs at the end, definitely would reccomend this.<//Review>

Jonny taught me some of the basics for 10 min. on the beach but the rest was learning by doing. I never felt unsafe or uncomfortable. Jonny did a great job letting me learn by myself but always helping me out in the important moments. I will definately go again to learn some more.<//Text></record>

<Text>My surflesson with Jonny was an amazing experience. It was my first time surfing and thanks to him I was able to get up on the board pretty quick and catch lots of waves.
Everyone was welcoming and friendly. Highly recommend surfing at Kapowuis.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Took a trip to Venice Beach and at last minute my twelve year old daughter decided to surf. Korrey gave her a 20 minute class and within a short time my daughter was surfing up on a board. He definitely knows his stuff!!!!  (Korrey was a pro surfer and it definitely showed as my daughter had never surfed).<//Text>

We can do this about 50% of the time since we have so many instructors but I'm always bummed when we can't.  Because we want to give every one the experience of dancing on water at least one time in their life. I'm stoked she got the chance. I'll let Korrey know about your review, he will be SSSTTTTTTTOOOOOOOOOOOKKKKKKKKKKKEEEEDDDDDD!!!!!!  Martin."}<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

Great Experience. First time surfing for my daughter and myself. Corey was super patient with both of us and we both were up riding waves within half an hour. We'll be back.</Text>

<review>I've taken several surfing classes before and I still learned so much from Martin - the dynamics of the board, a new way to do the pop-up etc. He and his team are really lovely guys, would definitely recommend to anyone!</review>< Pics>

I met one of the surf instructors, Will Ermish, while in Bali earlier this month. He offered to give me a lesson which I was thrilled about. I wasn't nervous at all because I knew how knowledgable Will was and he made me feel incredibely comfortable and at ease. He was so informative and really really knows what he is doing. Plus he is so friendly, funny, wise and just all around a great guy to be around. He made me fall in love with surfing and by far was one of the best days in Bali I've had. Wish I lived in Venice so I could keep getting lessons from him, but I left that one session with the skills to know I'd be able to go out and try it on my own :)< /review>

I had an amazing time on the water. As first time surfers in choppy water, me, my mom, and my sister were still able to get up with the help of our instructor and learn surfing fundamentals.</text>

<date>1494082076080<//date><rate>5</rate><Review>The Quick Summary:  I walked away feeling so damn happy and successful. If you are showing up as a student, you're going to walk away feeling like a true surfer.

My Experience:  This team was so happy and approachable. My instructor (also named Will) really went into a lot of detail with me and had positive patience and laugh-tastic encouragement. Via his help I check off one bucket list item several times. That's freak'n rad!  Seek your wave breaks with these guys. And while I'm sure the whole team has this perk: if YOU have fear or concern about surfing, seek out the Instructor Will. He'll effortlessly give you the courage and support you need.< /Review>< Pics>

These guys are great!! Everyone we interacted with had the best energy possible. Our instructor, Will, was particularly awesome. He brought the right vibe entirely and also gave great instruction, despite tough conditions for a couple of beginners. He dealt incredibly well with the varying level of experience between me and my girlfriend and helped her catch her first waves ever! Will helped her conquer her fears and made sure she was as comfortable as possible. The whole thing ended with some major smiles, rad photos, and great memories. Plus, I now can cross off the last item on my list of making sure Ali (gf) is a badass of a keeper... catching a couple rides on the first time out... shoooot!!  I recommend these guys to anyone and everyone. Thanks, Kapowui team!<//review>

I had sooo much fun this morning with Will!!! It was my first time surfing in my entire life, he was soo patient with me even though I kept on falling off the board, he continuously brought soo much energy and positivity with such clear communication on how to correct my form so I could stay upright on the board, and ultimately be able to ride the waves all the way to the end with comfort and confidence, which I did!!! Thanks to Will of course! I couldn't of been any happier with my experience from this morning!!! To anyone out there who wants to try out surfing but is intimidated that they will not be able to get the hang of it right away or not enjoy their surf lesson then you definitely need to check this place out! I promise you won't be disappointed, you'll have soo much fun, you'll love the environment, the clear communication from the instructors, how patient they are, the tremendous amount of positivity and energy they bring, and most importantly you'll definitely be able to learn how to surf if you continue having surf lessons with them! I can't wait until my next lesson! These guys are awesome!!!<//Text>

Phenomenal group of instructors.
Me and my gal pal came to LA with intentions of only staying 5 days , then the plan was to go to Vegas for the remaining 5 days.
Long story short, we had our first lesson day 2 and by day 3 we had cancelled Vegas,  extended our stay in Venice beach,bought a package surfing  deal each so we could surf once a day everyday until it was time to head back.
My friend was a natural and was able to pop up on the board day 1.
Me , not so much. I kept trying and kept falling right into the water. Our first instructor Leon (who we had 4 sessions with) then made the observation that  i overshoot when I put my foot up when getting on the board.  I was too far up on the board when I popped up. So he said I'd need to be far back on the board ,more so than others since I have that habit of putting my leg to far forward. And whatddya know, suddenly I was balacing on that board! Amazing correction.
Our 2nd instructor Tod (we wanted to try as many instructors as possible to see what we could take from each one as everyone has their own style and methods) gave me the awesome advice to pop up on the board a bit faster and use my hands to balancs once im up so I'd stay on longer. Amazing feedback as that improved my balance greatly.
Will gave us gorgeous  waves and his ability to time them so they wouldn't be too overwhelming for us was impressive especially since the waves were massive when we went out for our lesson with him. He especially helped me with my fear of getting back into the water with my board which is honestly terrifying to me as I often felt like between the wind, water and sand (that would cement me in the ground) I felt I had little control over my board when getting back into the safe zone past the breaking waves.
I should say that every instructor addressed this fear with me and showed me how to get inside but I felt like I was able to spend more time making sure it stuck with Will in particular.

From day one till my last surfing session today (until I come back next month) myprogress is amazing and a true testament to how great these guys are at their jobs.
And as for my friend,  she's a natural....but can't swim very well. And they had her feeling so brave and taught her exactly how to protect herself in the water - this is a big deal for a girl who is scared of the water.

If you want to learn surfing , this is the group of people to go to. They're super fun, genuinely good people and VERY knowledgeable and skilled in their field.
They will take great care of you.
Thank you for everything guys, see you in September ❤ x< /Review>

<date>1490407156021</date><Rating>5< /Rating><text>We were on an 8-day, 1700 mile whirlwind tour of California/Nevada last week with the family, when we were walking along Venice Beach in the morning before taking off for San Francisco. I was taking a picture of this very cool VW van with surfboards on it, when a guy came over and suggested we take surfing lessons. It put the spark in my partners mind, but i was a little more reserved.  It would completely round out the trip which included skiing in Heavenly, Lake Tahoe, hot springs in the Sierras, Death Valley and the High Roller in Vegas.  But, we didn't have a lot of time before heading to Alcatraz.

The guy, Blake, said he wouldn't be able to take us until later, because the tide was high, but to think about it and let him know if we were interested. We walked a bit, and the surf seemed huge! I never surfed before, and being from Nova Scotia, the waves seemed ginormous.

I was also a little unsure about a surfing outfit running out of a VW van on the beach. Seemed straight out of a novel or a movie. A bit unreal. Were there better options out there? So i took a minute to look through some reviews. Everything seemed good. Lots of great reviews for them, so i said why not?

Blake couldn't take us right away and we couldn't wait much longer because we had to get on the road, so one of the owner's, Marty came in special for us.  As a business owner, that in itself tells me that he's conscientious. And the equipment was clean and in great condition. The wetsuits were even on the top of the van warming up for us.

Then there was the dryland training. They made sure all of our group were ready for the water before we went out. Super safety conscious. Both of them were so positive and experienced that i felt totally safe. The waves were big, but they kept us all sorted out and motivated.  i even got up 5 times!!!

I really can't say enough about Kapowui. If i could give 10 stars out of 5, i would.  It's the real deal. If you are looking for an authentic surf experience at Venice Beach, Marty will give it to you. I'm so glad i took the plunge. It was the highlight of an already pretty epic adventure. Worth every penny!</text>< Pics>

I stopped by the truck with my three godchildren (14, 12, 12) from Iowa. Martin was so open and enthusiastic. We came back the next day for 2-hour lessons with Todd which they adored. We will be back for more the next time they come!< /Review>

(Translated by Google) Thanks to Kapowui and a HUGE THANK YOU to Thierry!
Super teacher, always positive, patient and educationalist, Thierry was able to reassure me and encourage me for this initiation to surfing!
A little (very) stressed, he answered all my questions with kindness and kindness, well before the course.
Obviously, we do not surf alone after the first lesson ^^ but it allows you to start to feel the glide and the pleasure it can provide
In summary, go ahead with your eyes closed, I loved this initiation so much that it convinced me to do a longer internship to really learn to surf :)

(Original)
Merci à Kapowui et un ENORME MERCI à Thierry!
Super prof, toujours positif, patient et pédagogue, Thierry a su me rassurer et m'encourager pour cette initiation au surf !
Un peu (très) stressée, il a répondu à toutes mes questions avec bienveillance et gentillesse et ce, bien avant le cours.
Evidemment, on ne surfe pas tout seul au bout de la première leçon ^^ mais elle permet de commencer à sentir la glisse et le plaisir que cela peut procurer
En résumé, allez-y les yeux fermés, j'ai tellement adoré cette initiation que ça m'a convaincu de faire un stage plus long pour vraiment apprendre à surfer :)< /Text>

<text>(Translated by Google) We loved our first experience surfing ... we were there early ... the top, no bathers to interfere with our first learning ... we were a little afraid of the cold water at first but the school we ready a wet suit. So it was perfect ... a great activity to do especially with teens who are just waiting to live new adventures. Special thanks to Will, our teacher, for his patience and kindness ... great organization. Congratulations and thank you again for this great time.

Nous avons adoré notre première expérience en surf...nous y étions tôt...le top, pas de baigneurs pour gêner nos premiers apprentissages...on a eu un peu peur de l’eau froide au début mais l’école nous prête un wet suit.

<Response>{'time': 1527365301951, 'text': "Forest, this is Martin with kapowui,  I saw your 2 star review on Google,  can you tell me what the problem was? When I talked to you and your wife after your lesson you seemed happy with the lesson. I'm hoping that it was just a mistake when you left us a review. I want everyone to have a great time and your experience is very important to us and if you didn't have a good time I would like to know how what you thought the problem was so I can address it with your instructor and if I could possibly do something to make it right for you.We are a small company and our reviews are very important for us and affect our business tremendously.  Todd, your instructor thought your experience was good. He sent this to me to send you ,\n\nHi Forest, So I noticed the 2 star review and I'm truly sorry that you weren't happy. What could I have done to have made it better? Is there anything that you think I did wrong? Please let me know. I realize it was in tough conditions that' why I gave you a extra 30 minutes and  I tried my hardest to make it fun with the conditions I had to work with. If you truly feel I did a poor job then I would like to return the $30 tip you gave me because I must not have deserved it. I hope you get this soon and I hope to hear from you soon as well. Send me your Venmo or paypal address and I will send you your tip back. And If you would like to do another lesson in the future I would love to do it and make up for  whatever you think I did wrong.  Thank you.\n\n-Todd"}< /Response>< GmapID>

<Resp>{'time': 1550450814199, 'text': "Dear Luke, This is a fake review or you have left this review for wrong company. Very odd, 99.9 % of the time anyone who has a bad experience they leaves details about their experiences in the review or have verbally let me know. We haven't done a lesson with a Luke since summer 7 months ago, from my experience no one leaves a review more than a week or two after their lessons,  usually a day or two. I've been in business 13 years so I'm very aware of how people leave reviews. In 13 years the very very few people who have had a lesson that didn't meet their expectation , 99% of those people let their instructor know immediately. No one has complained about a lesson with us in a long time and this is the peak of winter and we aren't doing many lessons at this time. Also very odd that I have updated my response to your review several times because it bothers me and I know google sends you a copy of my reply yet you haven't responded, which proves to me this is a BS fake review.  If this is a real review please contact me and let me know what your issue was and we can discuss it and I will find a solution or help you understand why your expectations were not met. until then I will think you are full of sxxt.   However I also see you live in Ohio and it's the middle of winter and freezing there now with the polar vortex (mid February). I also see how you have left nine- 1 or 2 star reviews in the last couple of hours, all for places in Ohio. I've taken screenshots on my computer just in case you change them. I've dealt with fake reviews before so I know how to combat against them no.  So tell me, how did you get to LA and back so quick? I personally think you are having a bad day and/ or you are bored and want to make other people suffer like you are, so you are leaving random reviews. To let you know reviews are very serious for any company and I especially take all reviews very serious, however I can not take your serious because I also see that out of the 70 reviews you have left 80% are 1 or 2 stars, and I also see your review history and it doesn't add up. However I could be wrong,And for any potential lessons reading this, the only reason your explanation would not be met would be due to conditions which are out of our control and we always warn our clients about and try to reschedule.  I personally don't think you ever leave Ohio, I think you are one of those people who wished they traveled and are bitter that you do not, and you so you travel online and then leave reviews for companies you wish you could go to. Prove me wrong and post a picture of you at my company. Everyone takes a picture of their lesson because we have the coolest set up in LA. If you did a lesson with us. So  post a picture, a screenshot of your booking,  or a screenshot of you phone history showing you were at my business and I will give you a sincere apology,  a back rub and and dinner, otherwise I will assume this is a fake lesson.  And if this is a fake review from a loser,  try to start enjoying life, stop being a bitter loser, and hurting other people. I know you don't think so by reading all of your other reviews but life is awesome get outside and go have a snowball fight with some kids. If you are lonely and depressed and need someone to talk to give me a call, i'll cheer you up!!!!!!.  Martin    I wish I could feel pity for you but I can't since you have attacked my company/ me for no reason."}<//Resp>< UserId.>
