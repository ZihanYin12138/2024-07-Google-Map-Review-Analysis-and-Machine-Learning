<Text>Waiting for five packages they say they attempted to deliver them last Thursday. It is a lie .We were sitting by the front door with it open. We received 10 other packages that day . If they had actually had attempted to deliver the packages they would see us sitting in the living room. I have a door bell.One lie after another , 4 days later no packages. They are two blocks away. I'm in a wheelchair. I don't drive or have transportation, can't they get it together enough to bring my order?<//Text>< pics>

<Text>This Post office is absolutely pathetic. I was trying to fill my envelope and this employee that I took a photograph of just snaps at me and tells me " not to do it there because her counter was open" really??  You didn't have to be so abrasive and idiotic about it for goodness sake. She needs to take some happy pills or something. The customer service is absolutely disgusting. If any of you people want to be treated like a five-year-old child???  by all means go here.  This is the reason why the US Post Office is going downhill like it is. Obviously the low rating on google speaks for itself. They treat their customers like garbage. #neveragain. Peace!<//Text>< Pics>

I have had live birds delivered to the Cathedral City post office five to six  times in the past.  Today I’m expecting another delivery.  The purpose of this review is to describe the deterioration  in service I received in the today compared to past telephone encounters.  I called four times today, listened to the automated message and remained on the line as instructed.  Four times I was placed automatically on  hold and then disconnected after lengthy waits.  A woman answered the fifth call.  However, she was less than helpful.  Previously when I had birds shipped  and phoned the post office, each person who answered offered to see if they had any live birds delivered that day.  The woman today was dead set on not leaving her desk..  She repeatedly referred me to the automated system to check my tracking number. I asked if she would see if anything was delivered for me today and she declined, stating she cannot confirm my identity over the phone.  Who knows why today’s interaction was horrible.  Maybe it’s less staffing, maybe a particularly busy time or maybe just a lazy employee.  That’s for the management to figure out.  One would think with the horrible press the USPS has received lately, specifically in terms of birds arriving dead, employees and management would be eager to rectify that reputation.  That certainly wasn’t my experience today.< /text>

This Post Office as many others is suffering from COVID related fall of customer service. Things have gotten sloppy and the employees seem to not care about the customer. The USPS need complete overhaul from top to bottom.<//Text>

I received a tampered box (box 1). A box (box 2) within the bigger box (box 1) containing screen protectors for tablets was taken outside the bigger box (box 1). Box 2 was emptied out then shoved back inside box 1. Box 1 was delivered tampered to my front door. I'm lucky whoever tampered with my property didn't try to reach for the more expensive items. I contacted Amazon to report the product stolen. Hopefully they have better luck than I did in trying to deal with this postal office.< /Review>

<Review>Have always had good experience at this post office. These workers are limited at what they can and can not do. The person you buy stamps from may not be the person who needs to take care of your problem, don't yell or get mad, kindly ask who would be better to talk to or kindly ask to talk to a supervisor. The customer is NOT always right, regardless of who says so, however they can be a big part of the problem because of that way of thinking. Things happen folks, life is not perfect nor are people. Try to do better from your end and you may be surprised at what could happen. Put yourself in someones else's shoes. Keep safe, wear your mask (even over your nose), and be kind to others, you do not know what is going on in their life and yes it is your problem, treat others the way you want to be treated.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

Bad customer service. A one lady with a spike hair didn't give my package, I've been a customer in that store and that was my first experienced that someone refuse to give a package since i already present my ID even tho it's out of state and not a hard copy, all i know is only they need is my name and  my address. I always get my package in that store, only that one lady with a spike hair is the one who refused to give a good service. this a the 2nd time i met her at the counter and she seems not good at cooperating other races when she knows they had a bad english...< /text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>This place is a joke! I wish I can give zero stars! I went there yesterday for a package to be ship a guy told me that he wasn’t able to tape my package and I’d had to purchase a $5 packaging tape just to tape my package and if I wanted a returning label I’d have to purchase it too or write it on the box! What?! So I go there today and my package was tape but with masking tape (that’s all I had) another older guy told me that , that wasn’t allowed which I understood but told him if he can just tape it I don’t have any other tape , he said no and he also said I can buy that $5 tape. I told him when I go to the one in Palm Springs they tape it for me and he told me that , that isn’t allowed and they can get fired for that! Are you kidding me fired for a damn $1 tape to be tapped for a paying customer?! Never again I went to ups they taped my package for free and even made it cheaper for me because I told them about my experience and this location. Never again!</text>< pictures>

<review>I get an email from Amazon telling me my package was delivered and that the postman gave it directly to the resident. Well I don't know what resident he gave it to but it sure wasn't us. And you can forget about trying to call to get someone to get it handled. I guess I'm going to have to go there in person and stand in line for 30 minutes. This isn't the first time nor the second time the mail-person delivered a package to the wrong address. Nor the last you can be sure of that .< /review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

Our mailman SUCKS...Date Palm/30th area. He slams our packages down EVERY TIME, regardless of clearly marked "FRAGILE" labels. If he hates his job that much, he should quit and let someone else have it. There's no reason for him to be so extremely disrespectful.< /text>

No matter how much I emphasize my address on the packaging they continuously give my mail to the apartment besides mine when my packaging CLEARLY states the apartment number. Can't tell you how many lost packages I have had because the postman are just too lazy to double check the apartment they're throwing the package to.<//Review>

Attitude, attitude, attitude, did I say attitude? The lady boss couldn't care less if you are disappointed or unhappy about a particular situation. Feel like being looked down on? Are you a masochist? This is the place! The USPS is a mess at this location. Go to Palm Desert or Palm Springs. The crew at CC would be very pleased if you did. Step your game up guys-starts at the top, miss manager. You could pretend you care-just a suggestion. Maybe an acting class would help.<//Text>

It has now been a year since my last review... The mail (with tracking numbers) says out for delivery. The mailman comes but does not have the packages. How does that happen?
I ask "where are the packages?" And the mailman  looks at me dumbfounded and half panicked. He tells me that "there is another girl delivering  in this area." Two hours later (almost 8pm) and still no packages. And these folks want to raise their rates?
Still unreliable and consistently inconsistent 11 months later. Almost 6pm. No mail. Maybe this local office would rather not exist? Not sure what the problem is.< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< response>

I'd say that there is at least maybe one or two workers at the office itself are great and friendly. However, there is a short woman with curly hair that is utterly horrible and doesn't care one bit about customers or ppl. I went to ship a package there in July, the receipt never received the package. I go back to the post office to see whats up and if there is anything I can do. The lady tells me that since I do too have the tracking number there is nothing they can do and the package will be lost forever. That didn't sound right or true so I visited the online site only to find out that she liked and there is something I can do to find it.
Recently, I order a package on March 30th and it was supposed to be delivered by April 5th. I tracked it online and on the 5th it never showed up even though the app claims it was. I tried talking to my mailman and he too was very rude telling me that he can't do anything and didn't want to check his records or anything. I told him that I didn't receive it but the app says I did and all he would say is it was delivered, it was delivered, it was delivered even after I told him I didn't get and it couldn't have because if it was my brother or mom would of said so.<//review>

The worst experience I’ve ever experienced the lady attacked me verbally from the moment I walked through the door because I brought a big box of my own to be mailed. She made several people get out of line because she felt they were not ready to mail when they were standing in line with. Then she waits until I get to the front to say they don’t make labels! This is the United States Post Office!!! How do you not make any labels??? What am I going out of my way to come here to pay you for if I have to do my job and your job! She was rude , had a major attitude and has zero consideration along side with no customer service! I would hate to think how mauling will go with Christmas upon us! They need to fix this ASAP. Completely unacceptable!!< /review>

One of the supervisor there won't let me get my package, she's asking to much of information, I just showed my paypal acct and my name is link on that business name and even showed my SS# ,she even asking for a California drivers license which I have right now is Washington..I mean why we need to go that far all I want is to get my package, pretty simple. So I just had to make a refund from the item that I bought online. Bcuz I didn't get it and it should be return to the seller.<//Review>

< review>
it warms my cockles to see that amazon has finally grown sick and tired of the way usps has been been constantly mishandling / refusing to deliver their shipments... amazon has just announced that it will be replacing usps / ups / fedex with their own amazon-branded van delivery service replacing lazy usps carriers with their own "independent owner / operator" drivers which actually WANT to deliver your orders to you. the usps - especially the cathedral city office - have been nothing short of completely unprofessional and irresponsible regarding the way they have absolutely refused to reprimand / replace their rude office employees and lazy carrier(s) for deciding that they don't want to deliver amazon's packages... instead, they encourage and "back" the carrier(s) to be lazy. this entire post office's management and staff need to be shipped off to a usps location hundreds of miles north of the arctic circle and replaced with well-trained employees which do not mind doing the work that they are employed to do, and which will treat their customers with the dignity and respect that they deserve... viva amazon the usps slayer!! :)<//review>

Not the most reliable place, if you get  a package lost or even worse, delivered to the WRONG ADDRESS, don't expect any help. Happened to a friend of mine and was not helped at all, just kept getting passed on to two different people with no answers. No post-master in sight< /Text>

My truck broke down while towing my toy hauler.  I needed a place to stay overnight while my truck was being repaired in Blythe.  Burton's was highly recommended to me.

The park was clean and very quiet.  After my truck was fixed, I stayed another night to enjoy another beautiful desert sunset.

The price was right and a propane refill spot is just down the street from them.< /text>

I've been living here for 3 months and love it.
You couldn't ask for better managers. They  were on top of the small repairs needed. The park is well kept and a pleasant place to live. Close to all the stores here in Blythe. I rate the park 5 stars< /Text>

I’m not sure of their actual defined service area but trust me when I say, I’d ask them for anything in relation to their marketplace and rest easy at night knowing that they are the very best in the business👩‍💼 !! They are proudly serving me for the last 4 years in my home(s) 🏡, boats/yachts, toy haulers and motor homes, tile grout in kitchens/laundry rooms/bathrooms and showers.

They cleaned the carpets on the room and stairs, very professional. They said they would arrive between noon and 4pm, they came around 1h30m and they finished before 4pm.
We are very happy with the results.</Review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><review>We had our carpets cleaned on 9/29 by Clean & Dry Carpet Care.  The gentleman that did the cleaning was very polite, pleasant and answered any questions that I had.  He worked very hard and was meticulous in his work.  He wore a face mask during the entire time he was in our home.  Very pleased by the cleaning performed.  This was the third time we have used Clean & Dry and extremely pleased with this company.  Excellent and will definitely be using again when the time comes.  Would highly recommend this company!</review>< Pics>

<text>First of all, the new guy stole cash out of my wallet!  When they left I notice my open purse on the floor behind the door.  All my cash was taken!  Second the cleaning of my sectional sofa and area rug was just mediocre.  It did not look or feel clean.  I used them for my carpet cleaning and two chairs in the past and the work was pretty good.  Not this time.  I called the owner about the theft.< /text>< Pics>

After not being completely satisfied with other more well known and larger carpet cleaning companies we decided to give Clean and Dry a shot.  Not enough can be said about their prompt and courteous service.  They were able to extract stains that the other cleaners said were "to set in to get out."  The crew spent whatever time was needed to make sure all spots were completely gone.  I've waited three weeks to write this to see if those stains would return.  They haven't. Also, there was a discrepancy on the bill.  I talked to Marcos and explained my concern.  After looking into it he contacted me and agreed there was a incorrect charge and he promptly refunded that portion of my payment.  I can't say enough positive things about this carpet cleaning company.  They will definitely do our carpets again.< /Review>

<review>Today I had the pleasure of meeting Anthony with Clean and Dry Carpet Care! My carpets came out awesome! It was definitely time for my carpets to have their cleaning done.
He was ready to help me with anything that I needed, more than willing to help! He was very personal, friendly and was nice to talk to someone with a great personality!
Not only that, but he was working hard and getting the job done properly! I also appreciate when companies hire great workers but even more so when their employees are outstanding at interacting in a social way! I had a great time meeting him and think of him as a friend now and can't wait till he comes back to clean my carpets next time!
I ordered the deodorizer and their brush pro pulled out a lot of pet hair. He vacuumed the edges in all my rooms. Outstanding!
I recommend to everyone.
Prices are excellent, took care of me and when he left, he asked if I had anymore questions or needed anymore info. 5 stars in my book and forever will be calling them! Oodles of respect!

<review>Booking online was super easy and loved how prices were listed as well. The guys came, checked out the carpet, asked a few questions then reviewed the pricing and made any adjustments if needed. Process only took one hour for a living room, master bedroom, and smaller bedroom. Total was only $150 (house is right under 1,000 sq ft) very pleased with the outcome and professionalism.<//review></record></dataset><record>

I called and needed service same day. They came out and did an amazing job at getting my carpets super clean. I have 3 little kiddos at home and had a few spots and they were able to remove them.  It was dry in just a few hours which was great! I would definitely refer them to my family and friends!</review>

<Pics>None< /Pics><Review>Very happy with my carpets! I have a lot of company coming over now as summer is coming closer so I called Clean and Dry.
I needed them while I was home between work for 2 hours and they arrived on time.  I appreciated that they let me know an hour before they were on their way so that I was ready.
Anthony and Ruben did a really nice job. They also were friendly and answered all the questions I had!
I was unsure how well my carpets would come out because they were really dirty, and so Anthony explained to me their deep cleaning process. He explained it very well and I appreciate their service. I would recommend Clean and Dry to anyone! High quality service<//Review><Rate>5< /Rate><date>1525561946548<//date><user_name>Shannon Murphy</user_name></record>

I have my carpets cleaned twice a year with Clean & Dry Carpet Cleaning. Great pricing and service. I'm very pleased with the service and cleaning of my carpet. Anthony did a very  great job cleaning my carpets and a very courteous person. I would recommend them  to anyone who wants their carpet cleaned.
Thanks, Tailo S.</Review>

Anthony was right on time and explained to me the condition of my carpets, how they were able to stay in great condition and how they can remain in great condition! I learned something new about my carpets today he was able to explain to me about. I trust Clean and Dry Carpet care for now on when cleaning my carpets!<//text>< rate>

Marcos and his crew did an amazing job!  He came to our office and cleaned, it looked so good, I had him come and do our house too.
I called them for a quote because of the reviews online and I am so glad I did, sometimes the reviews are hard to believe, but all were true in this case.  They are so nice and accommodating, Marcos really knows how to get and KEEP customers.
I will never use another company again.  I will refer him to EVERYONE that I know.<//text>

We just bought a home and the carpet was horrendous, we thought we might need to replace it. I called Clean and Dry Carpet Care and Marcos, the owner, answered and was able to assist me that same day! After Marcos had completed the job our carpet looked brand new! Literally saved us a lot of money and now we do not have to replace our carpet. I highly recommend Clean and Dry Carpet Care (Marcos)!<//review>

Marcos- Threw 2 years of dirt and spills and many seasons my carpet was done. It needed a deep clean and brought back to life. The best thing about the your service is that you were friendly, responsive, fast, and you knew what would make the carpet look great again. I am happy with the service and that also when i was busy working i was able to communicate threw text made it easy. I have told all my friends and people that are looking for a good guy to get the job done and that your the one to get a hold of. Thanks again for your kindness and making my home feel like home again.<//text>

Marcos, is the owner and he came to my house after business hours.  I asked him if he could come over at 7:00 p.m and he helped me out and made it happen for me at the only time I could make it happen.  He did a great job in my home and even got a couple horrible stains out that I didn't think was possible.  They have been there for years and I have had my carpets cleaned by other companies before.  Marcos takes great pride in his business and it shows!  He also had a great attitude and I felt comfortable with him in my home.  I highly recommend Marcos and Clean & Dry Carpet!!<//text>

<Text>In response to my mom Wanda Watts rating and review  I have a text from the carpet cleaner guy this morning@10 am saying that she was next and they’d be on their way. The fact is when you have an appointment you show up. Her phone wasn’t ringing for some unknown reason,but she had a scheduled appointment she made yesterday. We found another company that responded and was there in 20 minutes. They were wanting to work and got our business< /Text>< Time>

<Response>{'time': 1525637937804, 'text': 'Sorry you feel that way Elaine.\nWe did send a text and tried to reach your mom numerous times over the course of 4 hours with no answer or response. She did call us back around 2pm asking if we could still service her home which our tech said he would come right over if that was still ok which they came to agreement it was. However after noticing we were short equipment on the van which was being used at another location we called to see if it would be ok to reschedule till tomorrow or later in the day but if not we would still come out to Service her home. At that point Service was  declined and we were hung up on. We tried to call again to apologize and try to explain the situation and we see if there was anything we could do to make it work which unfortunately was unresolved.\nWe always try and send 30-1hr notice before we arrive. If no answers we leave a message/Text and wait up to 30min then try again and again if no answer we leave message that we couldn’t get an approval that someone would be home and if Service was still needed please call back so we could come and provide service. We then proceed to the next stop and still keep job on the route until we get a call that we would be able to access Home for service.\nThanks for the feed back and we will look into our process and see where we can improve service for each and every customer.'}<//Response>< gmapID>

CLEAN & DRY CARPET CLEANING is an Impeccably run, outstanding carpet cleaning service with add-on (too many to mention-they’ve accommodated ALL my service needs requests! 🥳) or stand alone packages available for every customer and all payment metrics may be approved!!! Serving the greater beautiful California Central Valley (I’m located in Ceres<Modesto> -unincorporated 95358 StanCo.) I’m not sure of their actual defined service area but trust me when I say, I’d ask them for anything in relation to their marketplace and rest easy at night knowing that they are the very best in the business👩‍💼 !! They are proudly serving me for the last 4 years in my home(s) 🏡, boats/yachts, toy haulers and motor homes, tile grout in kitchens/laundry rooms/bathrooms and showers. They can steam clean and sanitize just about ANYTHING-Just ask...I did!!<//Review>

They cleaned the carpets on the room and stairs, very professional. They said they would arrive between noon and 4pm, they came around 1h30m and they finished before 4pm.
We are very happy with the results.< /review>

The gentleman that did the cleaning was very polite, pleasant and answered any questions that I had.  He worked very hard and was meticulous in his work.  He wore a face mask during the entire time he was in our home.  Very pleased by the cleaning performed.  This was the third time we have used Clean & Dry and extremely pleased with this company.  Excellent and will definitely be using again when the time comes.  Would highly recommend this company!</review>< pics>

<review>First of all, the new guy stole cash out of my wallet!  When they left I notice my open purse on the floor behind the door.  All my cash was taken!  Second the cleaning of my sectional sofa and area rug was just mediocre.  It did not look or feel clean.  I used them for my carpet cleaning and two chairs in the past and the work was pretty good.  Not this time.  I called the owner about the theft.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< Resp>

<rate>5<//rate><Review>After not being completely satisfied with other more well known and larger carpet cleaning companies we decided to give Clean and Dry a shot.  Not enough can be said about their prompt and courteous service.  They were able to extract stains that the other cleaners said were "to set in to get out."  The crew spent whatever time was needed to make sure all spots were completely gone.  I've waited three weeks to write this to see if those stains would return.  They haven't. Also, there was a discrepancy on the bill.  I talked to Marcos and explained my concern.  After looking into it he contacted me and agreed there was a incorrect charge and he promptly refunded that portion of my payment.  I can't say enough positive things about this carpet cleaning company.  They will definitely do our carpets again.< /Review>< Pictures>

Great. customer service, my carpet came out beautiful, fluffy & the color was even better than I remember.  A bit disappointed for the $30 deodorizer they added, that smell only lasted 2 hours. But I would use them again.</review>

<Review>Today I had the pleasure of meeting Anthony with Clean and Dry Carpet Care! My carpets came out awesome! It was definitely time for my carpets to have their cleaning done.
He was ready to help me with anything that I needed, more than willing to help! He was very personal, friendly and was nice to talk to someone with a great personality!
Not only that, but he was working hard and getting the job done properly! I also appreciate when companies hire great workers but even more so when their employees are outstanding at interacting in a social way! I had a great time meeting him and think of him as a friend now and can't wait till he comes back to clean my carpets next time!
I ordered the deodorizer and their brush pro pulled out a lot of pet hair. He vacuumed the edges in all my rooms. Outstanding!
I recommend to everyone.
Prices are excellent, took care of me and when he left, he asked if I had anymore questions or needed anymore info. 5 stars in my book and forever will be calling them! Oodles of respect!

< Review>
Booking online was super easy and loved how prices were listed as well. The guys came, checked out the carpet, asked a few questions then reviewed the pricing and made any adjustments if needed. Process only took one hour for a living room, master bedroom, and smaller bedroom. Total was only $150 (house is right under 1,000 sq ft) very pleased with the outcome and professionalism.<//Review>

<Text>I called and needed service same day. They came out and did an amazing job at getting my carpets super clean. I have 3 little kiddos at home and had a few spots and they were able to remove them.  It was dry in just a few hours which was great! I would definitely refer them to my family and friends!</Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None<//response>< gmap_id>

Very happy with my carpets! I have a lot of company coming over now as summer is coming closer so I called Clean and Dry.
I needed them while I was home between work for 2 hours and they arrived on time.  I appreciated that they let me know an hour before they were on their way so that I was ready.
Anthony and Ruben did a really nice job. They also were friendly and answered all the questions I had!
I was unsure how well my carpets would come out because they were really dirty, and so Anthony explained to me their deep cleaning process. He explained it very well and I appreciate their service. I would recommend Clean and Dry to anyone! High quality service<//Review>

Thanks, Tailo S.</text>

Anthony was right on time and explained to me the condition of my carpets, how they were able to stay in great condition and how they can remain in great condition! I learned something new about my carpets today he was able to explain to me about. I trust Clean and Dry Carpet care for now on when cleaning my carpets!<//text>< pictures>

I called them for a quote because of the reviews online and I am so glad I did, sometimes the reviews are hard to believe, but all were true in this case.  They are so nice and accommodating, Marcos really knows how to get and KEEP customers.
I will never use another company again.  I will refer him to EVERYONE that I know.< /Text>< Pics>

<Review>We just bought a home and the carpet was horrendous, we thought we might need to replace it. I called Clean and Dry Carpet Care and Marcos, the owner, answered and was able to assist me that same day! After Marcos had completed the job our carpet looked brand new! Literally saved us a lot of money and now we do not have to replace our carpet. I highly recommend Clean and Dry Carpet Care (Marcos)!</Review><rating>5</rating>< user_id>

<text>Marcos- Threw 2 years of dirt and spills and many seasons my carpet was done. It needed a deep clean and brought back to life. The best thing about the your service is that you were friendly, responsive, fast, and you knew what would make the carpet look great again. I am happy with the service and that also when i was busy working i was able to communicate threw text made it easy. I have told all my friends and people that are looking for a good guy to get the job done and that your the one to get a hold of. Thanks again for your kindness and making my home feel like home again.</text><pics>None</pics>< Response>

Marcos, is the owner and he came to my house after business hours.  I asked him if he could come over at 7:00 p.m and he helped me out and made it happen for me at the only time I could make it happen.  He did a great job in my home and even got a couple horrible stains out that I didn't think was possible.  They have been there for years and I have had my carpets cleaned by other companies before.  Marcos takes great pride in his business and it shows!  He also had a great attitude and I felt comfortable with him in my home.  I highly recommend Marcos and Clean & Dry Carpet!!< /Text>

I had my tenants move out of my property in Modesto. When i went out to see it i noticed they had animals and did not tell me. I quickly called Marcos at Clean and Dry. He was over within 24hrs and did an amazing job. We have used him several times as well as referred him to several clients. I have nothing but good things to say about his service. Great communication, honest and very good at what he does. I will continue to call when service is needed. Thanks Marcos.< /Text>

<resp>{'time': 1525637937804, 'text': 'Sorry you feel that way Elaine.\nWe did send a text and tried to reach your mom numerous times over the course of 4 hours with no answer or response. She did call us back around 2pm asking if we could still service her home which our tech said he would come right over if that was still ok which they came to agreement it was. However after noticing we were short equipment on the van which was being used at another location we called to see if it would be ok to reschedule till tomorrow or later in the day but if not we would still come out to Service her home. At that point Service was  declined and we were hung up on. We tried to call again to apologize and try to explain the situation and we see if there was anything we could do to make it work which unfortunately was unresolved.\nWe always try and send 30-1hr notice before we arrive. If no answers we leave a message/Text and wait up to 30min then try again and again if no answer we leave message that we couldn’t get an approval that someone would be home and if Service was still needed please call back so we could come and provide service. We then proceed to the next stop and still keep job on the route until we get a call that we would be able to access Home for service.\nThanks for the feed back and we will look into our process and see where we can improve service for each and every customer.'}<//resp><userid>100883102100705733924<//userid>< Text>
In response to my mom Wanda Watts rating and review  I have a text from the carpet cleaner guy this morning@10 am saying that she was next and they’d be on their way. The fact is when you have an appointment you show up. Her phone wasn’t ringing for some unknown reason,but she had a scheduled appointment she made yesterday. We found another company that responded and was there in 20 minutes. They were wanting to work and got our business<//Text>

Decided to appear for Thanksgiving dinner at the Pinon Hills Community Center on Thanksgiving Evening and WOW!  What a surprise!  The people we're absolutely amazing and friendly. They served all the guests present and personally asked if we enjoyed ourselves... Of course we certainly did. It was so warm, inviting and friend for those who had no other dinner invitation or planned to cooked if alone. I was encouraged with those that put the Dinner on for the community because of how warm, kind and giving they were to everyone.  It was a Blessing for my husband and I. Met some nice people!</Text>

Fixed charges (service charges) are too expensive then you still have to pay for the water you use.  And yet the chromium 6 levels in the water are way too high exceeding state guidelines.</text>

Had a gathering with some friends that were going away. I knew about the park, but I didn't know the rec center could be rented. Everything was really nice despite it being really cold that day.<//Review>

<Review>last night was the first time we went to this magnificent restaurant. But It is definitely not the last time. We had great time with the efficient service, with the high quality  meal and wine and with the comfortable charge. We will no doubt return there in a short time.< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< resp>

< Review>
I celebrated my PhD last night in this delicious restaurant. Well it was a incredible evening and the place was absolutely the reason for the successful meeting. The waiters  participated in a gorgeous way, the food was tasty and my buddies were very  joyful. We shall surely return for more events. thanks very much.</Review>

<review>One of the more modern Panda stores. Well located. Access is fine, but on a very busy retail corner in the midst of several college campuses. I suppose this is great since the food doesn't have much time to sit in the serving bowls. Food is fresh when served. And there tends to be more variety ready to try prior to ordering.< /review><resp>None<//resp><pics>None<//pics><name>Mark Upshaw</name>< gmap_id>

Have been here a few times. Food is good and service is good. It is always busy and they handle it fine but I think they could use an extra person or two to help out. They always seem to be working hard but the line is always slow. Over all a good place for a decent price just need to work out some staffing issues.<//Review>

I've been going to this Panda Express for over 4 years and I've rarely had anything less than a positive experience. The food isn't award-winning but it's as good as any other Panda Express. If you're unlucky enough to have to wait on an item, you get a free drink which is great. The employees are always exceptionally friendly and attentive here. My only real complaint is that, in the past, I've seen the manager get into heated arguments with the staff that were awkward and felt inappropriate to be dealt with out on the floor where the customers are. Also I wish there was a way to tell if their Peach Green Tea was in stock before ordering a drink because it's the only thing I can tolerate from there and it's very disheartening to pay $2 for a cup and them be completely out.<//review>

<name>Maria Martinez</name><text>I just to love panda and the cool thing is it's close to my house but  Yesterday when I went to buy I noticed that the portion that was given to me was 3 times less  What's going on now just cause is getting better a means that you want to give your customers less I took a picture of it to show the manager on my next visit but I just feel that I'm being ripped off you need to be careful on the portions you give people were pain to get our food not begging for anything for free<//text>< rating>

They have a good selection of items, some old favorites that don't change and they keep thinks interesting by adding new dish from time to time.  The one thing I don't like is how they changed the flavor of the chow mein.  Lately the chow mein tastes very bland, not sure what they changed but I wish they would go back to the way they use to make it.<//Review>

<review>Of course any fast food place can be expected to have long lines but this location for some reason don't know what a line is. Even if your next in line they get the next people trying to skip ahead and pretend that they don't know where the line is and completely ignoring anyone else that actually waited. Not only that but after ordering I never got my food because they sold it to someone else!!! Were they training the new guys? Idk but what kind of ridiculous establishment let's it get so far as to sell paid food to someone else -_-<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

Fast service, food was good, and the restaurant was fairly clean. But they were shamelessly aggressive with the upsells. We got hit with 4, AND, when I went to pay, they asked if they could keep the change!< /Text>

I go to this restaurant because is very close to home, but 9 times out of 10 that have empty trays. Always run out of food, and you have to wait between 5 to 10 min. To get your plate. Servers are not to friendly.<//Review>

Wait took 15 minutes, portion sizes are a joke for 7-10$ a plate minus a drink. Don't waste your time go to the location off of Orangethorpe, at least you'll get full.<//Text>

Great place to eat
I bring my son every week to eat here after school the place is always clean the food is always good and the staff is GREAT
They are always very nice and everybody always have a smile on their face they always go above and beyond to take care of their customers
by far way better than expected from a fast food place
kudos to the staff and to the manager for always a great experience and a good job

Best regards</Review>

<review>(Translated by Google) I have had two bad experiences in this place, come back the second time because I thought the first time I could have been a mistake of the people they serve. And I wanted to give a new chance. But this time my dish was served with small portions, I would not put forks or the sauce that the cashier had offered much less fortune cookie. And I will not if asked by the owners who serve those portions that have eaten at others and what they charge is well served.

(Original)
He tenido dos malas experiencias en este lugar,regrese la segunda vez porque pensé que la primera vez podría haber sido un error de las personas que sirven. Y quise dar una nueva oportunidad. Pero esta vez mi plato lo sirvieron con pequeñas porciones, no me pusieron tenedores, ni las salsa que había ofrecido la cajera y mucho menos la galleta de la fortuna. Y yo no se si es por los dueños que pidan servir esas porciones porque he comido en otros y por lo que cobran esta bien servido.</review>< GmapID>

AAA Self Storage took the worry and hassle out of storing. The manager, Ralph, is friendly, attentive, and willing to drop everything and assist customers. We rented the courtesy moving truck for a day and that experience was completely hassle free. There are a lot of options when it comes to storage, I would highly suggest selecting AAA Self Storage!<//text>

<Review>Excellent Customer Service and Attention to Detail by Ralph Espalin, Onsite Manager in Huntington Beach who takes a very proprietary interest in the high quality service provided to his customers  and the AAA Storage experience.

I ultimately decided on a unit and he was able to secure it for me, as I was not going to move in for 2 weeks. A week later my situation changed and I no longer needed the unit and he was very accommodating and was able to credit me back the entire amount of my rental. I would definitely come back to this facility in the future when I need storage.</text><gmap_id>0x80dd2663cdf7e439:0x106a4ca7be8245ea</gmap_id>< user_name>

<name>chris09mejia1</name><review>These guys are great. The manager there is proactive about who goes in and who goes out. They have cameras throughout. I didnt know im suppose to punch in my pass code even when the person behind me opens the gate. I was eventually greeted by the manager asking who I was. To me that shows an effort to keep thieves out. I gladly told them who I was and where I was renting and they kindly let me know to check in so they have a registered way of knowing who's in and out. Never had attitude from any of the staff. Been with them for about 4-5 months.</review><GmapID>0x80dd2663cdf7e439:0x106a4ca7be8245ea</GmapID><response>{'time': 1602223654030, 'text': 'Chris, Thank you for storing at AAA Self Storage and thank you for taking the time to leave this 5 STAR review and your kind words.

<Review>very self serving managment ,and the hours are very short closed on all holidays and only have elevator for items no people allowed meaning you and Grandma are constantly going up and down stairs in an un air-conditioned very hot building that has black mold last time I was there everywhere. Breathe Deep Relax that's just the mold spores invading your alveoli nothing to worry about.</Review></record>

<Name>Mark Davis</Name>< Review>
It's about the least expensive storage I have ever found in orange county, they run it well. They keep it up and maintain it well. I will have had this storage from March 2012 to present February 2018, 6 years, however it has gone up in price for a 8by10' storage from less than 70$/month if I remember correctly to 114$/month. Now I have gotten rid, given away, donated, or sold a lot of my stuff, and I plan on getting out by the end of this month. Will enjoy the 114$ a month. Hallelujah<//Review>

Very polite and very friendly fast at getting contract done and very reasonable prices.

<review>We have been using AAA for a few years. It has been fine and it is a clean place. There is crawl space between at least my unit though. They must have hired a new manager because this guy is a complete jerk. He reminds me of a tweeker or some other abuser by his appearance and his bad attitude. This genius decided to slurry coat the entire complex on a business day and failed to notify all his customers. People had loaded vehicles and also needed to have access to their units but were rudely prohibited by this lame brain. He said no one could enter although he was walking on the dry asphalt himself. His authoritarian complex was evident as he barked at anyone who talked to him. Including a contractor. My suggestion is to find another storage facility. We looked into it when we got home and found comparable storage close by. We will be moving out. The last thing I need is an angry , loser storage manager on top of dealing with my precious junk lol.</review><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

Pretty unprofessional over the phone, Limited access to push dollies, weird hours to be open, and the front desk management seems to not listen very well... despite being told several times what I wanted my passcode to be.

Other than that it's a standard storage area. If you are debating between this and another company, just check out ease of use.< /text>

Other than your facility needing updates and moderlization it was very clean and easy to .locate and drive through. Your .managers are down.  to earth and hospitable friendly and were easy to follow on procedures such as the gate coding the date and rent,  and departure rules to folliw. I would had been more trill but your facility needs a later gate time other than 6:15 pm close out. But your prices are more than good for the size of unit I rented. Thats a good perk. And yes I would refer someone if interested. Thank you, Bobbi Williams

Very disappointed by the staff here. Very friendly upfront but not after service begins.

Parking situation is... interesting. You get in trouble if you wait in your car for 5 minutes or longer. Storage units don't have lights and are layered with cardboard or cheap wood at the bottom.

Would only recommend for storing stuff you will never need.</text>

{'time': 1484605389718, 'text': 'Dear Andy G.,\nI want to thank you for your review.  I investigated the situation and here is what I found.  Our facility has HD video surveillance throughout our storage yard.  The footage clearly shows that you parked in a rented RV space for over 30 minutes, that did not belong to you, where you were found snoozing off and is not proper use of our storage facility.  Our visitor parking is in front of the office so I don’t understand how our parking situation is interesting.  Although the unit your employer rented is not lit, we do offer units with lighting.  She simply chose something different.  If you wish to discuss this further feel free to call me directly at 714-777-2015, ext 1004.\n\nSincerely,\n\nRuben Rivera'}</Resp>

The Upper Hand is incredible. Their level of professionalism all while making you feel absolutely comfortable makes this place awesome. This team doesn't just do the bare minimum and rush you out - the entire staff GENUINELY cares about your treatments and using products that work and fit best for you. I've never been to a salon that cares this deeply for each person who walks through their doors. If I had the money I would come here every day! Lisa is amazing and wants each person to feel cared for and pampered like royalty. 12/10 recommend. ALSO the Farm House Fresh products they have here are HEAVENLY!!! Amazing Salon!< /Text>

Today was my first day visiting The Upper Hand and let me just tell you, I was WOWED!! Not only does it smell heavenly, but all the ladies pride themselves on making you feel at home. I was able to relax and enjoy myself. Karina did an awesome job on my toes and really took her time, you can tell she takes pride in her work.

Today I had the pleasure of having a mini facial with Taylor. It was such a treat! Not only did she make me feel super comfortable, but she had a gentle but firm hand. The products she used smelled amazing, and it left me relaxed but intrigued to come back for a full facial. Thank you Taylor< /Text>

Went with the full pamper pedicure (farmhouse fresh pedi) and was not disappointed!!  Lisa did both my gel mani and pedi and both were amazing.  Everyone at the salon was super friendly and welcoming.  Big shout out to Upper Hand, I will recommend to friends/family in the San Diego area.  Thank you ladies!!<//review>

<Review>Lisa did a phenomenal job I love my pedicure. She explained with detail how to care for my feet since I am a diabetic, she did a better job explaining than the medical spa I use to go to. I will definitely recommend her to friends and family. She has earned a life long customer.</Review></record>

I love The upper Hand Spa Salon. Lisa (the owner) is very friendly, and she prides herself on  the quality of services provided to every single one of her clients. My nails never looked better! True spa feeling♥. Her Spa is beautiful, clean, and offers an array quality products. I went to her Spa Boutique at Christmas time to purchase some products to be gifted to some of my clients. My clients loved  the candles, hand lotions, body oils, etc.<//Review>

Not recommended. They let people show up late to their appointments and pushes other people appointments to wait for that person to finish.  Then I received "jokes" about still getting done on time because I was last of the day...which made me feel like I was less important and question if I got the full experience. Because my pedicure was delayed that delayed my facial again making me feel like I was being rushed through it. When came out of the room no one else was there and lights were off. Got in my car to find I still had mask on my face. SHE LET ME LEAVE WITH MASK ON MY FACE!!!! I knew I should have just left when my  10am appoinyment didn't start until after 1030am< /text>

I was the last in and did turn overhead lights off in the boutique only since it was still light out. I won’t do that again since it was negative to you. I did leave all the other lights on. I will check into the mask being left on !! Not acceptable even at 50% off.

Just had one of the best experiences at Upper Hand Spa, the whole team is welcoming. Karina is amazing and a perfectionist, she was not done until my toes and feet looked perfect! The products they use are incredible, cruelty free, natural, and smell amazing. Looking forward next to my service.< /review>

Coming to the Upper Hand Spa is a genuine spa experience.  The spa is pristinely clean, with private rooms and soothing music.  You won't see crowds here waiting for their turn or talking on their phones.  The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing, and it always smells nice inside.

Lisa is a true professional who specializes in providing exactly how you want your nails to look.  She has a great selection of colors, and uses products with low odor.  I always leave the Upper Hand Salon relaxed and looking forward to my next visit.</review>

< Review>
The Upper Hand Spa Salon is the only place I go! Their amazing pedicures and facials are my favorite but they have many other services I can't wait to try.  I get all my Farmhouse Fresh skin care products from them and my skin has never looked better. I am 48 years old but my skin looks younger and healthier than it did when I was 38! This place is more than a salon, it's a safe haven for anyone who needs a little zen, peace, and tranquility while indulging in some self care.</Review>

Even the products are excellent (natural, non-toxic, etc). My typical mani/pedi experience has always been hectic, even stressful. Not how it should be.. My nails became weak from the chemicals, as I found when salons were closed due to covid, my unmanicured nails were actually becoming healthier, stronger. For just a little more $ you can have a healthy, relaxing experience here. Well worth it!!!!< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

I had my first pedi at The Upper Hand Spa Salon with Lisa. It was the most wonderful experience I’ve ever had getting a pedi! Lisa is awesome and uses only the best products. I had the Farmhouse pedi done and my feet have never looked so good and felt so healthy! Very professional and knowledgeable and I will definitely be back. Even though we had to be outside with this pandemic going on, the pampering was amazing! Thank you Lisa!<//Review>

<Text>Upperhand Salon in La Mesa is such great Salon. I love getting my pedicures and nails done here and I’m really looking forward to getting that massage and facial I had booked, until lockdown! I also love the products they use ( Farmhouse Fresh )and love purchasing them for home and gifts for my friends!!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

From the moment you walk through the front door you are able to breathe and pause. The entrance has two doors, allowing you to walk through one, be still, and enter into the foyer with the other. Farmhouse Fresh products line the shelves and the estheticians are knowledgeable on what each product will help you with. In addition, there are 2 private mani/pedi rooms, creating your own pampering bubble. Soon, a make up station will be available, helping us match our foundation and all the rest of the goodies we have questions with! I've gone here for years and LOVE their new location in La Mesa!</Review>

I see Amy for massage regularly and she is terrific. She takes time before each session to review how things are progressing and also after to point out changes or suggestions for after care. She also keeps meticulous notes and compares session to session. Very pleased with the service I receive.< /Review>

<Text>This review is only for Amy the masseuse. I don't have any experience with the hair dressers. Amy is amazing! I go in aching and stiff and come out an hour later feeling my muscles loose and relaxed. I like that afterwards she talks about what is going on with my body and what steps I can take to alleviate any future discomfort. She clearly knows her stuff and her prices are reasonable.<//Text><pics>None</pics><resp>{'time': 1621566328650, 'text': 'Aimee is definitely the bomb!'}<//resp>< Gmap_id>

Telegraph and Bancroft what do you expect? I eat there often. It's close by and cheap. You might even say boring. So today I order the new Southwest Chicken Club and no one there knows what's on it. The pictures on their menu show what looks like Guacamole. I googled it. It lists guacamole as one of the ingredients. I was charged for Guacamole anyway and I ordered the meal. I only got one cookie by the way. I was told only certain Subway stores include guacamole. This one doesn't. They are usually busy and they make a good sandwich there. Today was just an off day I guess? My advice, just order the daily special and tell them what you want on it.</review>

It's an alright subway worst than most but not bad. Subway isnt great in general they over charge for what they give and give very little, low quality food, but it's cheaper than a real sandwich so...< /review>

I walked in and the employee was just standing on her phone in my sight. When I called out for assistance about 3 times, she just grunted like I was interrupting her life. In the past, they’ve been stingy with serving sizes, now they don’t even serve at this location. I used to love subway until this location.</Review>

Okay, its a Subway you walk in knowing what you're going to get...its fast, has a daily special sandwich, and follows the Subway promotions. There are obviously better food choices.<//Review>

This location is absolutely terrible. The customer service is nonexistent. I can live without the bubbly over the top service, but the workers are just straight up rude. When I asked for extra lettuce the man helping me literally refused to give me more. My entire interaction was disrespectful and the salad I ended up with was the worst I'd ever gotten from a subway, ever. Do NOT go to this location.

I hope the owner of this subway will read these reviews. You can see multiple people have complained about a male employee. He is not a good worker and should be fired.< /text>

Does this place just not get stock in? Every time i go in they dont have what i want. Went in today and wanted pastrami. None left. When i asked if it was not served there anymore i was given a yes answer. Please take it off your menu if you dont serve it anymore.< /Review>

Normally I can get in and out quickly and get food but I showed up at 8:20 pm when the hours said until 9 pm and it was locked up with 2 employees inside. They saw 3 of us try to enter and ignored us.<//review>

Subway - the go-to place when you're looking for something cheap but healthy to eat. It's actually not that bad, just like other Subway locations they have the footlongs, 6 inch subs, desserts, drinks, etc. Very small store though with seating for barely more than 8 or so people. Like the Chipotle branch close by, Subway can get crowded during the lunch hour quite fast. Service is good overall.< /text>

This was my first time getting any type of waxing done I was a little nervous going in but talking to Sherry at the front desk made me feel a whole lot better. Sam the one who did the waxing is amazing she made me feel comfortable through the whole process and she did an amazing job I will definitely be coming back again. Anybody that hasn't tried it and is thinking about doing it  i recommend coming to this place. Thanks guys..</Text>

I had Felicia complete my waxing and she was so awesome so friendly and my eyebrows and lip look amazing she made me feel so comfortable the entire time and she sanitized everything perfectly. I’ll for sure keep going back to her every time! Thank you Felicia!<//Text>< Pictures>

The entire staff is wonderful. Your first waxing is free, depending on what you're getting lots of course. No one judges here, they know how to make you feel comfortable. I've grown to become friends with my waxer. I refer this location to all my friends. And if I don't know you and you're reading this and you go, tell them Naomi sent you.< /Review>

Sierra is amazing! So many of my friends and family go to her. She does a great job, is friendly, and personable! She is also very reliable! One suggestion, make an appointment at the counter, calling doesn’t always work out too well! I will continue to recommend Sierra for all waxing needs to everyone! She is the best!</Review>

I'm loving this location. I just moved here so I've only been 2 times but I've had good experiences so far. At other locations they either wouldn't do a good job on my wax or I'd feel uncomfortable there for a couple reasons. Ciara does a phenomenal job on my waxes and I havent felt out of place here.</Review>

Professional, welcoming, fast, thorough & it was a very chill and clean atmosphere. Ciara was awesome! Very little pain, she explained each step as she worked, and the wax used was perfect for my sensitive skin. Plus, the extended hours they’re open each day is amazing! I will definitely be booking her @ European Wax Center in Clovis from here on out! 🥰< /Review>

I have had quite a few of the girls wax me. So far Sam, she is the best and least painful. She is also down to earth friendly and you can tell experienced.
I would recommend her.

<review>This was my first time visiting EWC and the first time I’ve had a Brazilian wax in over 10 years. Upon walking in, the receptionists were very friendly and gave me all the the information I might need about savings/current promotions. I was taken back to a room quickly, it was clean, well lit and I felt very comfortable. Kasandra did an excellent job, she explained everything she would be using and the steps she would be taking. She was polite, friendly and made me feel very relaxed.
Over all, a great experience and I’ll be back again!</review><name>Jodie Mettler< /name>< user>

It was my first time waxing by recommendation of a coworker. I didn't wait long before my waxer, Jenna, got me from the waiting room. She explained the process to me and made me feel comfortable. It was painless and an overall enjoyable experience.
Thank You Jenna!</Text>

< Review>
Update: Went back and was very well taken care of. The girl was very quick and friendly and did an excellent job. The prices are scheduled to increase at the end of the month and that's a bummer.

Last time I was there I got a Brazilian. They charged $50 and didn't remove all the hair. I pointed this out to the girl who waxed me and she told me we'd get it next time. I was so mad. They charge a lot for this service and then didn't do a good job. After that I bought a home waxing kit. I'm not going to pay for a second service when the first one didn't do what it was supposed to. I was rushed and the staff tried to up sell me every chance they got, to the point of being rude.< /Review>

< review>
Had my first Brazilian today with Ciara and I am glad I chose to do it here at EWC! The front end staff was very friendly. Ciara explained the whole process and made me feel very comfortable throughout the whole thing. I definitely recommend coming here for your waxing needs. Thank you all so much!< /review>

<Time>1484724853953< /Time><rate>2< /rate><review>My best friend and I came here to get our first Brazilian wax ever! We chose this place because it  specialized in waxing and also they have an amazing deal that if you have not ever been to a European wax center before, you can get a free wax or half off on a wax. Overall the wax was amazing and I definitely want to do it on a regular basis but sadly my friend and I will not be returning here. Here's why, when we first walked in everything was great, great customer service we didn't have to wait long for our appointments. Now my friend and I were in two different rooms. Her experience in the room was different from mine. As for me I expected a professional esthetician to sort of talk you through it take your mind off the fact that you have your vagina in her face! Instead I was the one making conversation and then it was just silence. Very uncomfortable! Now as for the waxing it self it did not hurt as bad as I thought, from 1-10 I would say about a 4. The whole process took about 15mins now that we were done she took me to the front showing me all the products that they carried and was explaining how they worked. I felt very pressured to buy literally everything she was trying to sell me mind you all of these items are $20 and up each now this was the same for my friend as well her girl even went as far as bringing items up to the counter that she never said she wanted. Now that was over and we just wanted to pay and leave. But NO now you have the girl in the front trying to set you on a plan for $500 and on top of this while I was paying she shows me what a good percentage is for a tip ! I declined on tipping her and at this time I was paying with my card so she proceeds to tell that they take cash for tips as well! Are you kidding me ! I have not even seen what my vagina looks like to give this girl a tip! This was our first time being waxed ever and it definitely was a horrible experience by being pressured to buy the entire store! I will definitely take my business else where.<//review>< pics>

The first time I went in they were doing free waxing because they had just opened the location and I thought waxing wasn't for me after that,I had a painful experience. I decided to try it again for grooming reasons and I got Ciara as an estetician and I fell in love with her work. One time I went to the river park location with a different gal and she left a lot of strays hairs. EWC is pricey but if you get a good esthetician thats experienced and makes you feel comfortable and feeling gorgeous after its totally worth it. P.s. The anti ingrown serum and exfoliating scrubs are a nice cherry on top.</Text></record></dataset><record>

Dominic arrived on time and prepared. Replaced my filters, flushed out my RO system and also checked my Hague water softener in the garage. He did a great job!  He made sure there was no leaks too. Very pleasant and professional service. Thanks Dominic. I totally recommend.</text>

I called Hague this morning about 8am. Told him I do not have any water pressure it took me 45 minutes to shower and I ended up having to rinse my hair with a gallon of water that I had saved for the dogs. They said they were extremely busy but would try and work me in it would have to be between two and five today. I got home at 1:45 Dominic showed up a few minutes after two went down and looked at the unit unfortunately can’t be saved but I have water now because he bypassed the unit and I am using strictly well water. Very professional service very nice young man and the fact that they came out the same day I called was phenomenal< /Text>

Our initial contact with Brett and Bert at Hague Quality Water was very good. They arrived on time for a very informative, relaxed and convincing presentation about the company and what they could do for us. The installation went very smoothly and then I waited to experience the advantages of soft water. After about two weeks, I can say that their promises were kept and we love our new water system. I would definately recommend Hague Quality Water to anyone interested in improving their water quality</text>

Jordan and Dom were here on time and did a great job. When they finished, Jordan explained what I needed to know and after almost a month, I’m very satisfied with my soft water system. I definitely recommend this family run company in San Diego and their Hague water softener system.</Review>

<text>Prompt service and completely reasonable pricing. We shopped three other big name companies in San Diego to install a simple water softener, replacing one that was already plumbed. One nameless company actually had the gall to quote $2,500 to put it in an $1,800 softener. The job literally only took 2 hours. Hague was great, did great work cleaned up and were done within the two hours. They also communicated throughout the process. They are highly recommended< /text>< Pictures>

Hague provided expert water purification counsel regarding my Julian well that is heavy in iron. I decided to buy a unit that purifies the water coming into the house. I opted to work with Hague over Culligan after I learned the business specializes in well water and has been providing services to the Julian community for many decades. I felt valued and appreciated. I trusted Brett Hague. The customer service was outstanding.< /text>

< Review>
From Bert to Brett to Jordan, I've had nothing but good experiences.  They are courteous, respectful, thorough and pleasant.  The take time to explain things.  They work quickly.  They communicate VERY well their intentions, especially ETAs and, most importantly, they ARE their word.  I had a question about whether a service that was done was working; they were genuinely concerned about MY concern and made arrangements to get out quickly to do follow-up.  VERY Professional.  They're the best.  As a business owner myself, I am happy that I've got Hague Quality Water to take care of me the way I take care of my customers, as I would want it for myself.<//Review>

Brett from Hague Quality Water came to my home to service my WATTS RO System.  He was very polite, professional and friendly.  While Brett was working he patiently explained possible problems with my old current system and how it should be maintained. He quoted me prices for future upgrades which I had requested. Fortunately, my tank just needed to be re- pressurized and system is presently working fine.

I would definitely recommend Hague Quality Water for service on reverse osmosis systems .</Text>

It turned out the drain line was inadvertently left unplugged on my new GE software system and the technician came out, saw the problem, plugged it in, spent about 20 minutes making sure all was working fine and left.  I was charged $137.50 and requested a greater discount due to the simple fix of the problem.  It was denied, hence I felt it to be an unfair charge.  That equates to $412.50 an hour to simply plug in a drain line that came with the water softener.  JM< /text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< resp>

It is amazing having a family owned business here in the community that cares about quality of service. We had a terrible water volume and discoloration problem.  The Huff's came out to troubleshoot and what was amazing, at no charge. Now that is customer service.

Brett noticed our system wasn't regenerating and got it working, with recommendations to frequently regenerate the system to unclog the system of the debris that had accumulated. Simply put this saved us from having to re-bed or buy a new unit.

He also suggested being on a well in our location, with so much Iron and manganese in the water, that we should have an Iron filter in front of our system. Which we invested in.  Bret re-piped everything from the main inlet pipe forward.  Very professionally done.  You can tell he takes extreme care to take the time and do the job right. They take great pride in their work and it is evident in the results, our water volume is up and the coloration is clear.

We would recommend Hague and the Huff's to anyone wanting to improve their water quality situation.<//Text>

<Text>Hague provided us with excellent service.  I will definitely recommend this company.   I know that their product actually works after having a Culligan system that did not work and ruined our faucets and appliances. Don't use Culligan for your well water.  Use Hague.  You won't be disappointed.   I reached out on Facebook for a company that specialized in well water and someone  recommended them.  I can honestly say I no longer have spots on my glass shower doors and there is no calcium build up on my faucets.

Jordan and Bert spent time answering ALL of our questions.  With so many water softener and filtration companies / options it was important for us to understand just what set Hague Water systems apart from the others.  Once we chose to work with Hague, they fit us in for an install and completed the job in less time than planned as well as kept the spaces they worked in very clean and neat.

Our water tastes great and it’s so easy to use. Our water softener delivers spa-like showers and helps keep our faucets healthy. Very thankful that Hague Quality Water consistently offers expertise, quality products and personable service that we can rely on. It’s actually refreshing to work with a company like yours!</text>

Very refreshing experience.  The people were punctual, did fabulous work installing both the RO and the softener and didn’t run off until they shared the operation and what we need to do to maintain the systems.  They also answered all our questions.  Great experience and we anticipate the great experience will continue.   Thanks Hague!<//review>

<review>My water softener was leaking, I called Brett. The following day the tech came out. He was very professional and knowledgeable, and just charge me the service fee to correct the issue. He gave me a few options to correct my problem which were in budget. I would highly recommend this company they are very professional.</review></record>

I was expecting a lengthy  install and no water for many hours, but Brett made it happen with less than 30 mins and neat set up. BEST OF BEST!</Review>< pictures>

We've had our water system for about 3 years now.  We purchased the system from Haque Quality Water and we also have them service the system.  The service we received from Hague has always been excellent. Personnel are professional, polite and efficient.  I would highly recommend Hague Quality Water!</Review>

Great customer service from a family-owned operation. The installation was quick , easy and free and done so professionally. You could tell Brett had installed many systems in the past. The water tastes awesome, at a fraction of the cost of water from the store.  I highly recommend them. Thanks Hague Quality Water!</review>

<text>Hague Quality Water quickly got back to me and same day was able to come over and give me a quote for a whole house filter/softener systems. Took time to go over every type of system (pro/cons/prices) and arranged installation within a week. Price was cheaper than most and explained how there quality was better than conventional whole house systems. Hague as a company manufactures there own systems instead of resale other manufacturers system. They also have a 25 year warranty depending on what system you get.

Family owned business that very friendly, upfront on everything, and took the extra step on everything from aesthetics to covering shoes when entering my house. Even the estimated time of installation was met.

Highly recommend them.< /text><pics>None<//pics><Resp>{'time': 1589429755559, 'text': 'Thanks Levi for taking the time and reviewing our company.

Had several estimates and the systems may sound the same from different dealers but the fine print shows the peace of mind of having a 25 year warranty, a system that cleans itself and to top it off....the system notifies you if you have a leak and even shuts off. This not only saves you from water damage but insurance companies love this and offer up discounts on home insurance. As for the customer service and professionalism... this is exactly what I was looking for. They communicated often, were on time, and finished when they said they would finish. Cant ask for more than that. Might not be the cheapest system out there but the quality you get and peace of mind is well worth it. Stop looking for a company to choose and go with Hague!< /text>

Bert is personable, but more important, he is extremely knowledgeable and honest. Very upfront about things. That's appreciated. He went over everything with us: How the system works, what it included, how would be installed, and all of our options as far as the Hague version of a low end water softener vs. Hague version of a high end water softener.

What's we made our decision, Brett and Jordan came out a few days later and installed the system in a few hours. Love the new water!

I've definitely noticed difference in how much shampoo and soap I needed to get suds. You don't realize how much hard water costs you (in all the little ways)until  you get it softened up.</Text>

I am so appreciative of Brett and Burt for thoroughly testing and identifying problems with the well water of my Mom’s house in Julian. Although the test results identified an iron problem ( colloidal iron) which is expensive and difficult to completely eliminate, Burt offered a more economical approach which he thought would help most of the way and he would provide “at his cost”. He also gave us good instructions and explanations on how to deal and live with the colloidal iron issue. Overall The Hague water system has greatly improved the quality of the water in the house! Prior to having the system, my Mom was having problems with her skin health and after getting the system her problems resolved and her drinking water is amazing! Burt and Brett are very caring and really do everything possible to take care of their customers< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Review>Bert, Brett, and Jordan were phenomenal from beginning to end. They were extremely patient with us for asking many questions. Most importantly, they are transparent. Everything was explained to us including how they would troubleshoot and fix our problem. The cost was reasonable and they explained the itemized invoice to us at the beginning including possible increases in the cost if certain issues were encountered. There were no surprises and everything they said was upheld. We appreciated the honesty and integrity of their work. They are very friendly and happy to talk and explain. We did not feel they were rushing to complete the job; rather they took the necessary time to get the job done right! We are extremely satisfied customers and would only recommend Hague Quality Water from now on after our poor experience with Rayne Water.< /Review>< Pictures>

<rating>5</rating><text>I would like to take a moment to say "Thank you" for a job well done. From every angle you exceeded my expectations. Including:

1. Providing a thorough explanation of what exactly was going wrong with the old water treatment system on our well.
2. Why the MaxPack Water Treatment System would be the optimum solution.
3. Product information and data sheet.
4. Offered flexibility in terms of multiple payment options.
5. Timely installation for both the exterior treatment equipment as well as the under sink reverse osmosis equipment in the kitchen.
6. Complete instructions in regards to operations, service & maintenance.

Water quality is better than ever and, most importantly, a very happy wife.

Thank you once again.<//text>< pictures>

< Review>
I’m new to Torrance California area, I recently moved here from Va. During COVID my son had missed dentist appointments due to dentist office being closed during Mar - May 2020 time frame. As soon I moved here I found Magic Land Children’s Dentistry when driving by one day. I called to make him an appointment and they were able to get him in to see him the very next day! They are friendly professional and make my son feel very comfortable coming to the dentist. I recommend this place for children’s dentist.< /Review>

I love Magicland Dentist. I started coming here during the pandemic bc I was looking for a kid friendly dentist office and I found it here. The staff are nice and friendly. The facility is clean. There is little to no wait time ..< /text>

Brought my 3 sons to get their teeth cleaning. I felt very comfortable bringing them in. It was not crowded and temperatures were checked. Very friendly staff, explained process and what they were doing to each child. I was able to sit right next to them which made us all feel extra comfortable. My boys love coming to see the dentist!! Thank you, Magicland for the great experience!< /review>

I love bringing my kids here! I have two kids a 6 year old and a 3 year old and I bring them both here. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. They make my kids experience comfortable. The environment and the extra amenities they have to not make the kids feel less scared is a plus. I highly recommend this place especially if you have little ones. Any questions I ever have are answered efficiently and they always let me know what is best for my kids.< /Text>

I’ve been bringing my three kids to this place since they each turned three, and I wouldn’t take them anywhere else! Magicland Dental has the friendliest staff, convenient appointment times and most importantly, they help keep my kids’ teeth healthy! I highly recommend this place for pediatric dental!! :)</Review>

<text>Where do I start! After a bad experience at another facility, this here is my top favorite! Not only customer service are extremely helpful, but the dental assistants and doctors are extremely patient and loving. They answer all your questions with no hesitation. My babies love everyone here and enjoy coming back. As a mom, you always want your kids to feel safe and they do that here! My kids trust everyone!
Thank you to everyone here especially Mary!

Made an appointment with my current insurance information for my two kids. Spent 15 minutes giving the insurance information to person who took call. Two weeks later my kids arrive to appointment and were told they couldn’t be seen because my insurance wasn’t valid. They used old insurance information from over 5 years ago. I spent 15 minutes giving all the information to the person who helped me and it was useless. Arrived at appointments and was told they book back to back appointments and my kids wouldn’t be able to be seen today. They are highly incompetent. They couldn't even verify insurance correctly. I would never use this facility, go elsewhere!</Review>

First time at Magicland Dental and I have to say they exceeded my expectations! The receptionist was always a friendly and extremely helpful. First time I bring my 9 month old and fist time I bring my five year old. My five year old got a cleaning done , she was excited the entire time. Giggling with the dr. she said she can’t wait to come back ! I definitely recommend this dentist office for the kiddos.</Text>

I am very much pleased with the dentist's, hygienist's,  and staff. I brought my daughter for a second opinion,  and I'm relieved I did. They diagnosed and addressed a tooth issue right away. Her previous dentist at a private practice one week before totally missed it. The hygienists did a great job. Very clean office.Kid friendly atmosphere. I can't say enough good things about Magicland.< /Text>

We have been bringing our son to this dentist office since he was of age around 2 yrs old. They are very clean and the staff is so wonderful with all the children. The best part is that each chair has a screen equipped with all the latest movies to keep the kiddos entertained. Alexandra cleaned his teeth this time and it was a breeze! So thankful for a place that we both feel comfortable being in.<//Review>

It was my son and my daughters first time here to start It was very very packed waited for 3 hours I asked how long more I would be waiting and the dental assistant said there was 3 patients before my son so I told her Ill just have to go i couldn’t wait 3 more hours. if they knew they couldn’t handle so many patients in one day then why make so many appointments. They really need to organize their schedule.< /text>

My daughter had a severe tooth pain. I was having issues with the insurance company. They said it wasn't going to cover to see that dentist. My daughter was crying. She was going through pain for 3 days We had to wait til Monday to see a dentist. The receptionist Idalid did not give up with the insurance company. They were bouncing us to different agents from the insurance. She was on the phone for over 2 hours. She managed to convince the insurance to clear my daughter to see the doctor. I 100 percent would recommend anyone to have your children come to magicland dental. The service was AWESOME!!! The doctor and the atmosphere there is very nice. They make the children feel at home. They treat your children like if they were there children❤️❤️< /Text>

I took my children in to what was suppose to be a cleaning and 6 month check up but little to I know there is no cleaning done they just policy teeth don't bother getting any build up out. All they know how to say is he or she Need to clean bette r and to make matters worse they claimed my daughter needed about six sealant that apparently insurance didn't cover so I would have to out of pocket the cost so I take to a regular non children dental office and to my surprise she didn't need any because sealants are for teeth that have deep creves and hers were flat total

<Review>As you can imagine, I am extremely upset.
My son's new dentist had to remove the old dental dressings from my son's teeth because in many of them they were done incorrectly, he showed me how the dressings were joined between the two teeth without having any separation between them, it seems ethically this not It must be done, I trusted that place for a long time thinking that they had highly trained personnel but I realized that they are not, because of the cures that they practiced on my son or even they were correctly diagnosed, so long ago I am overweight my great dissatisfaction with his work</Review>< Resp>

Manager Myrna and Dr. David with their team are nice and helpful.
My 3 years old son had 16 teeth fixed by Dr. David. He explained to us patiently and in details as he understands how worrying we are as parent for sending the little one to undergo a procedure of almost an hour. He was skillful pediatric dentist with many years of experience. i would highly recommend him.</text>

<Text>My daughter had asked me not to take her back to Magicland, but I insisted I took her for a cleaning because she’s getting braces next week (from a different Orthodontic office). At 22 minutes past her appointment time (we were still waiting).  I told the receptionist we were leaving & Not planning on ever returning.  I asked her to remove from any further mail, texts, etc.   The wait is always long just get in & then more waiting for actual treatment (unacceptable). The receptionists seem to be indifferent about their customer service. At my dentist I get in & out in 45min that’s w X-rays, Cleaning, & Consult. Also, The environment is some what noisy & chaotic which I now realize probably further contributes to my daughter’s dental anxiety.
There is no magic here folks.</Text>< Time>

First time here brought my kids for an ortho consultation and all the staff is very friendly. If I would've known about this place sooner I would've brought my kids along time ago. I recommend this place 100%.<//Review>

But they will be in rush always and for us no time to explain about the issue my kids had.< /Review><username>Navya Shri<//username>< Rate>

We asked staff that if the dental insurance covers before surgery, they say it fully cover. When bills came to us from insurance company, it was not covered. We pays $800. If it covers it would be only $100. They lied to us.<//review>

I asked several times how much longer because no one came to check on her  and the insisted she was next for over 20 minutes. I will be switching my daughters and sons dentist immediately.

<text>We've been coming here for about two years now.  Both of my boys are now almost 6 and 2.5 and although they are nervous they always walk out with smiles. The staff is always friendly and smiling, every one of them.  The only downfall is that there is always a wait time but then again so is every dentist/doctor's office.  The dentist themselves are incredibly quick and the dental hygienists are super quick as well, so even though you wait in the beginning, once your in the back you'll be out quick.  On top of that, the fact that every chair is showing a cartoon is probably the reason my kids have no problem coming here, huge bonus.

<rate>3</rate><Review>The first time we went here we got seen in a timely manner and they took great care of my daughter. Yesterday we just went for a 6 month check up (during a pandemic) and we were waiting for almost an hour to be seen. For some reason people that got there after us were seen before us because my child was only getting a checkup. (Eye roll) We were seen and out within 20 minutes but the wait to just be seen was ridiculous and I had to make a fuss just to get us seen. I don’t think it’s good practice to let people go first because their kid is getting more expensive procedures. It should be first come first served by appointment time, especially during a pandemic when the last thing people want to do is hang out in a room with a bunch of other people’s kids touching everything and people don’t have their masks over their noses or on their face at all.< /Review>< Pictures>

Dr David is fantastic, my younger daughter came in scared and nervous, he made her laugh and came out smiling. Dr Andean and Mary-Ann are amazing with my older daughter, she is smiling and love her clean smooth feeling teeth. Office Manager, Myrna, kept me informed and explained each procedures and take extra time on terms I didn’t understand.

I recommend Magicland Dental !!< /Review>< pictures>

Really cool facility for the kids to ease the anxiety of going to the dentist. Not everyone on staff is friendly but overall the service is excellent. I like that the  orthodontist is on site, so everything can get done at the same place. The downside is that they get too many appointments and it gets pretty busy and crowded. It’s not as bad now with COVID.
And I also love that they allow weekend appointments. This helps very much with my busy work schedule.< /Review>

<Text>My son and daughter have been coming to this dental office for about 5 years now. Mariela the one working at the front desk is very nice always greets everyone kindly, the dental assistant Yani is a very nice person very polite she will help you and answer any questions you need answered my kids love her, Dr Adrian is very nice she has lots of patience with the children she makes them feel comfortable, she makes the visits fun. Today's visit went great besides finding out that my son had some cavities to get done I was so worried for his first actual treatment but thanks to Dr. David who did the treatment on my son, he was absolutely great he explained the treatment one more time before starting he made my son feel comfortable his work was quick & clean my son is usually afraid of even getting his teeth cleaned but today he was great thanks to the doctor and the assistants helping I appreciate you guys taking care of my child.< /Text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1601052948535, 'text': "Thank you for your kind words about our team!

Every time we have an appointment we have to wait a long time to be seen. Our last appointment was at 2 and other patient's was at 2:30 and they were called in first even though we were there on time. I think they should be more organized with their appts, I'm just tired of waiting so long every time we have an appt.<//Text>

They have poor communication with parent. And apparently your not allowed in the room when your child is being treated, that was my final straw. They are ridiculous if they think I will allow my 4 year old daughter to be alone with them. They doctors can careless about your child and the health of their teeth. I saw 4 kids come out kicking and screaming. That's not normal.

< Review>
To start one of my children was supposed to have a teeth cleaning. The assistant litterly took a tooth brush and less then a min brushed my sons teeth with nothing on it. Im sure the insurance was billed for a cleaning. I didnt mention anything. Then my other child needed a cap and a cavity taken care of which we waited 45 min in the mornong with no other patient's except 1 child in the facility. To find out they expect a parent to wait in another room while they do this dental work. Not happeneing..<//Review>

I took my grand kids there, as I now have custody of them.  It was a terrific office, they have a movie theater, balloons for the kids, toys & more. But was the best part is the friendly staff, great dentists, & fun assistants.  They

Great place to take kids. My 5 year old son was greeted with all smiles. The Dentist and assistants were very gentle and awesome with him. Made my son feel special and he was more relaxed. They have games and a movie theater in the waiting area so the kids can wait in peace. I definitely would recommend this place 💯.</Text>

AMAZING DENTIST/STAFF. I came in today and was very happy with the service my daughter and I received, they made sure my daughter was comfortable doing her procedure. I’m thankful, and I strongly recommend this dental office if you have Children. It’s very sanitary, and nice. ❤️</text>

The dentists and staff are friendly, helpful and do a great job of putting the kids at ease. My son had to have teeth extracted and that process was as gentle as possible. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would have liked more information on the post-extraction care. For example, how long should he only eat soft/liquid food? Does he brush his teeth and mouthwash as usual same day? I was too distracted to ask these questions at the time, now I have to Google for answers.< /text>< Pictures>

<review>They wanted me to wait outside in the car on a hot day with my son because they didn't have more room for us in the lobby. They overbook patients and expect them to wait outside on a very sunny day. They need to be better organized and stop overbooking patients if they dont have room for them in the lobby.<//review><rating>1</rating><gmapID>0x80dd4b25fce9f9bd:0x70178fea8c4c4f6d<//gmapID></record></dataset><record>

This is a wonderful place. it is possible to come both on an apointment, and without record, on urgent. excellent staff and on the front desk and doctor. there is always a lot of fun for children: Toys, computers, mini cinema for 18 seats. children are always delighted and happily come to the next reception. after each reception each kid receives a small gift. we love this place and will always bring our children here!<//text>

<Review>Been going here regularly for my kid. Weekend is always busy but still good. Went (6/16/2020) for my kid check up.. again did wait for like 40 mins to see dentist but I like the place my kid doesn't complain so happy mom. Would recommend to kids younger they had (due to Covid-19 its closed) a play area, movie room and a screen in each chair for the kid to watch...

Went for a follow up had an appointment.. still waited for 50 mins.. went on a Wednesday at 4 pm. (9/23/2020)  consider changing dentist. But the dentist are friendly.. still thinking about other options..</Review>< Time>

Today is the last time we come here. We usually have to wait 30 minutes to an hour before we are seen but today is ridiculous! Our appointment was at 11am. We arrived on time. It is now 1:20 and we still have not seen the dentist. People’s time is valuable and should be respected. I understand some procedures may run longer than expected but waiting well over two hours without being see is beyond unacceptable.</Text>

The staff is great! The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it takes so long to seen after you arrive for your appointment and sign in. Why do you have to have an 'Appointment' to sit for an hour before you are called? Other than that issue, they are awesome!<//text>

My son always feels relaxed there, especially with the doctor and hygienist. He is autistic so it can be hard to get x-rays. Just depends on who we get as a technician. Overall, our experience has been very good there. The front office staff is always nice and patient.<//review>

I was referred by a family member to take my son to Magicland Childrens Dental after seeing that I could not find a dentist that I felt comfortable with to see my son whom had a tooth infection and recommended Dr. Mike. I went in feeling super anxious and unsure. However, the day of the appointment everyone was very nice and made sure my son was taken cared of. Doctor Mike made my son feel comfortable and safe. He did the procedure on my son and he didn't cry or said it hurt and he had 2 extractions. The Doctor was very gentle and talked him through the whole procedure. My son came out of the room super happy. They are very knowledgable and nice.<//review>

Jonathan and Valerie.  I can honestly say that I have never experienced a more genuine, professional and caring staff as the one from this establishment.  From the front desk staff to the doctor and dental assistant people.   Awesome and couldn’t ask for a better experience for our children.

I took my son to Magicland for his first ever appointment at 2. Because of the awesome kid environment and great practitioners at Magicland my son had a great experience and has never felt fear or angst about dental visits.  He's had fillings there and now at 10 he goes to the ortho.  They are efficient, informative and kind.  I would definitely recommend this dental group.< /text>

I can't stand this place!!! If I could give NO STARS, I would. I don't know why, but the service here has gone waaaaaaay down hill over the past few years. Not only are they ALWAYS running late, but they are constantly changing appointments. The orthodontist office is the worst! They are only there 3 or 4 days a week and sometimes just don't show up at all or leaving early; which makes scheduling an absolute nightmare! The wait time is completely unreasonable, taking up to 3 hours WITH AN APPOINTMENT!! They never call parents Ma'am, Sir or Mr./Ms. (Whoever), but rather, Mom/ Dad instead, even after constant request not to (because none of these grown people are my children!) The dental assistants are not gentle with small children and don't seem converse with any of them to comfort them. And some of the attitudes of the doctors, nurses, assistants and workers are just horrible. If you have a choice, DO NOT COME TO MAGICLAND DENTAL!!!<//text>

If you need your kids teeth cleaned DO NOT come here! They only polish and it’s no wonder after all these years my son had so much build up! At that point they told me he needed a deep cleaning and REFUSED to clean his teeth! My insurance wouldn’t pay for the deep cleaning and they never followed up with me. I asked if I could please make an appointment for a cleaning at this point it’s almost been a year from his last cleaning, I was told it would be left up to the dentist there if they will do it or not! I wasn’t going to waste anymore time and took him to my dentist and wouldn’t you know, no problem, teeth cleaned they never mentioned one word of a deep cleaning! This is just 1 of many other problems I’ve experienced here! Do yourself a favor and get a real dentist to clean your child’s teeth!<//text>

The staff is friendly and helpful but it is extremely difficult to get an appointment.  We have to wait months sometimes. My daughter's have braces and that requires that they see the orthodontist atleast once a month. But they have gone up to 4 months without seeing the dentist because they are always super busy. Today we had an appointment at 4:40 and they didn't call them in until 6:00. And still had them sitting and waiting for the dentist for another 15 minutes. I already paid in full for the braces or else I would have continued the treatment elsewhere.<//review>< Pics>

<review>Service is always great. Doctors and support staff great.  I will have to say that on this last visit, I found the reception area and restroom to be REALLY dirty.
Recently decided we would get braces.  Appointments go well but find that missing rubber bands, broken brackets and/or  dislodged wire will not be fixed prior to our next visit.  These issues do not constitute an emergency. No exceptions.  Not happy about that.</review><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
They have children lined up like cattle going to the slaughter! Parents are not allowed in the treatment rooms to comfort their children during what could be almost an hour of fear and anxiety with strangers in masks and gloves. I have excellent insurance so they looked for ways to charge me for unnecessary services like extracting an already loose tooth "to prevent infection" . ..are you kidding me!

Facility has everything a kid needs for entertainment, small movie theater, computers, games, toys (no books)..dont be fooled, its a distraction from the awful service!</Review>

< Review>
I've been going here for about 6 years now with 4 of my kids and they seem to be a pretty good place.  Most of the time it is pretty packed and yes sometimes the games don't work but that's what happens when you have hundreds of kids playing them all day long. The facility is clean I've never had a problem with them explaining what they're going to do to my children or being helpful and polite with calming my kids. I would give them five stars if they weren't always so packed.</Review>

We check in on time or early for every appointment and wait at least 30 minutes before being seen for a 5-10 minute appointment to change and tighten the bands on braces. Today we waited an HOUR and 15 minutes. It’s such a waste of time and disrespect shown to patients! If you value your time I would not recommend this orthodontist.</Review>

Everyone’s complaining about the wait time which I don’t understand they have to verify insurance and yes there are a lot of kids booked at one time.. I went today for my first time sons appt was at 8 it was about at 30-45min wait but I have lots of patience and I understand there is kids with same appt time slots and different needs but everyone was super friendly and just awesome customer service! I really appreciate everyone at this dental office thank you for the balloon and free toy for my son! I will be back in a few months!<//Review>

The ortho department is run assembly line style. The dentist spends about 5 min. with the patient.  The wait time even with an appointment can go from 30 min-45 min. There needs to be work on customer service from dentist to the front office.< /Text>

This place is ok, but for no reason try to reschedule an appointment. We never rescheduled in 3 years but the one time we did we couldn’t get an appointment for weeks. They asked me to call everyday to see if they had any cancellations and when I did they got mad and even hang up on me!</Review>

< Review>
Super long wait - we had an 8am appointment and didn’t get seen until 8:50, and the doc looked at my daughters teeth for 5 minutes and determined she had a cavity so we have to come back. They tried to charge us $75 for this visit (with no cleaning). It feels like a factory in there, wouldn’t recommend.<//Review>

<Text>It's been about 6 years since by son has been here but I saw some of the reviews for this place and wanted to share what happened when I took my then 5 year old there which I believed has caused him long term psychological fear of dentistry

He had a few cavities to get fixed.  They gave him a couple of pills to  relax him before the procedure, which didn't work at all. So they tied him up in a papoose then took him into a private room, stuck an instrument to keep his mouth open so they could work on him.  I could hear him SCREAMING in TERROR and horror the whole time.  I asked if I could go in to calm him down but they wouldn't allow me saying it's some privacy issue.  They had absolutely NO REACTION OR COMPASSION. My child was a cattle being herded through for them to get their insurance money.

Looking back at it now and seeing the results it has had on my son I consider it CHILD ABUSE what they did.   The front office looks beautiful and gives the illusion that it is so kid friendly BUT IT'S ALL SMOKE AND MIRROR.

Thank God I found an amazing and gentle dentist after this incident, Dr. David Suh (in Lomita).  I told him about this incident and he was flabbergasted.  My son to this day still has a hard time having Dr. Suh work on him but it's gotten so much better because Dr. Suh will let me sit in the room and hold his hand to reassure him the whole time. (No such thing as "Privacy Issue" like at Magic Land).  And when he gets too scared Dr. Suh will stop, joke with him or walk out to give me so some time to help him calm down.  He never tries to rush us to get the next person in.

I certainly hope this place has changed their practice by now.  If your child has simple quick and easy work to be done or has no anxiety or fear then go to this place.   But I still would recommend STAYING CLEAR FROM THIS PLACE and encourage you to find a small private family dental office that is focused on the patients well being and not their bottom line.< /Text>< user_id>

One of the worst they could care less about the patient and more about money. They lied about orthodontic treatment and did more damage then repair. Don't take your children there! They try to make you think they are good by decorating their office with toys but it is all a joke!!! The cleanings are very quick and  the tell you that you can't be with your child during their testament which is against the law.<//text>

<UserId.>116770577189184830882<//UserId.><Text>Well... where do I begin ? My daughter has been going to Magicland for the past year for her ortho treatment . I knew this place had horrible reviews and I chose to go in anyway because I knew she didn’t need any fillings she’s never had a cavity before . My first day consulting with the  ortho , I asked if parents were allowed to stay with their kids and she said yes . So I went ahead and signed up with them for a 2 year contract . Up until this point all my 9 year old really needed was a lot of changing the bands kinda appointments so I became comfortable leaving her there ( it’s an assembly line with all these kids lined up ) every time I would come in to check they seemed a little hesitant of my presence and assured me she would be ok. I get it ,the place is small and maybe they didn’t want all the parents there , but today she went in to remove her expanders and she was anxious and terrified . I set my grounds and I was not going to leave her there . Sure enough they asked what I was doing there and that I was not allowed to be there due to privacy policies . I explained that today she wasn’t just going to change her bands and that she has anxiety . They were going to remove her expanders and replace with a new one. To me and to my daughter’ level of anxiety this is major . I told the dr, I’m sorry this is major work . She says oh this is not a big deal they are just replacing it . Well... I know teens that have kept their expanders for a long time just because they fear it so much . Clearly they don’t understand that your child has had many anxiety attacks prior to having this done and they really dismiss your concerns .So basically you are treated as a number with no individual attention and your child’s emotional health is not a concern to them . This place needs medical curtains or  whatever it takes to create privacy but to expect parents to hand their child without the parents supervision is absurd not to mention how is it that they have space for a movie theater and separate sessions technological toys and not have private rooms for what is most important which is the privacy and health of their patients . Disappointed to say the least .< /Text>< resp>

<Review>I took my daughter there for first time she had an extraction the doctor was great he explained everything, he made my daughter feel confident. I love the gas sedation they offered.. it really helped my child to come down...
the only thing is that you cannot go in the room while they your kid is sedated. But you can see tru a glass door.
One thing I had to mention is that the front office personal was not as helpful as they should be and rude...
The procedure went fast ...
The place is clean and a nice  environment for children.<//Review>< Pics>

This place is TERRIBLE. First of all the ladies at the front desk have such a terrible attitude, almost like they're giving us the service for free. Yesterday at the orthodontist, we were informed that my son needed to get his upper canines extracted but they don't do teeth extractions at the orthodontist so we went here. We made an appointment for today for the extraction, so I told my husband to take a day off work so he can help me with him since he'd be sedated.  We show up today for the appointment and they tell us that the doctor that performs the extraction couldn't do it because he's on vacation!!! He's the only one who can put a patient sedation! The people were texting the doctor to ask him how to put him in sedation but we didn't want anyone putting my son under sedation other than a professional. No one told me this so my husband lost a day of work FOR NOTHING! At the end they wanted to charge me for a diagnostics that they didn't even perform! If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The people here are so unprofessional. I will NEVER recommend this place to ANYONE.<//review>

I took my daughter for her check up 1yr 3mths ago and they told me she needed crowns on her 4 front teeth. I was then pressured into believing the best thing for her was to sign off on this this procedure. It was such a horrible experience for her especially since her gums became very sensitive after that day. My little angel was traumatized after that experience moving forward we recently went to a NEW dentist that told us that procedure was completely unnecessary and the two front teeth and gums are infected and will now need to be removed! For the love of your kids do NOT  take them to this place they do not care for your child's best interest they just want to profit on unnecessary procedures.<//review>

Bravo! They deserve a medal for the work they carry out. They demonstrate such patience and empathy for children. They stay on track with their schedule but they never make you or your kids feel rushed or unimportant. They provide the attention each of your kids deserves and the attention you come to them to give them (the kids).

My two kids get their dental attention from this branch. Sometimes my youngest has thrown a tantrum, but no one on the staff loses their cool. They must really like children or get trained for working with young people. I applaud their hard work and effort. Most of all though, I applaud the great results they give you and their attitude.< /review>

I don't normally right reviews unless I am so impressed or so upset with the experience. This is by far, the worst and most traumatizing experience you can put you kid into. You, like me, will be fooled by the colors of the place, the little movie theater (you barely can see the picture), or the toys and drawings on the walls. From the moment you are waiting to be checked in, you will realize that you didn't expect you, they barely have time for you, they have no order, they have no line, it is first jump first served, and you will be lucky if they will actually serve you and not tell you "I'll be with you in a second" and then they don't.
We were initially referred here because our 5 years old has a cavity that needed filing and our regular dentist didn't have laughing gas, so we came here to have them give her laughing gas.
WARNING: Insurance doesn't cover laughing gas, so they will charge you $150 for laughing gas only. And if instead you choose the other option "the drink that makes your baby "Drunk" so that he/she forgets the horrifying experience" then the bill is even higher for this little cup ($220).
WARNING: They do not allow parents to be with their kids when they do any procedure that requires numbing or lagging gas. they will ask you to step out and which through the glass from behind the door how they are torturing your kid before the anesthetic kicks in and before the laughing gas make any effect on your kid.
WARNING: The will start the procedure whether the gas works or not, and whether the numbing works or not. And you will hear your kids screaming and crying and feeling betrayed by you for letting them take him/her from you and do what they are doing with him or her.
Warning: they put the child in supine position (flat back on and they are on top of him/her "similar to real major operation room" not in a recline position. And they will tie your child hands with a strong Velcro restrains.
WARNING: Your child will be horrified by this experience, and deeply traumatized. Laughing gas didn't work, or they didn't really have laughing gas in that mask. I am abstrusely convinced that they didn't have laughing gas and they actually charged me for nothing. My child was crying and screaming throughout the procedure, and she felt every pain and was horrified and kept saying "I want to see, I want to see" because the dentist had has hand on top of her face all the time, and kept her mouth open with a piece of plastic, and then covered her mouth with a sheet of plastic. I was concerned that she wasn't having enough space to breathe and the plastic sheet on her mouth giving moving up and down as if she was suffocating.
All the nurses did was laughing and having fun with the doctor and enjoying his stupid humor.

All the staff is young and not experienced. I don't think any of them is a parent or knows how to treat a child. We came here thinking we are doing the right thing so as not to traumatize our child with the experience of anesthetic shoots, we ended up feeling that we betrayed her trust in us and allowed them to traumatized here so badly. For the rest of that week, she kept having nightmares.

If you love your kid and you don't want to traumatize them, take them elsewhere.</review>< Gmap_id>

< Review>
Very nice place, staff is patient and explain in detail what needs to be done to your child, I love that they offer gas/sedation for children with the fear of dentists. Although my 5 year old daughter was still a little freaked out from her first dentist in hawthorne,  she did cry even with the gas, but that wasn't due to what they did to her here. They were in and out of her mouth in about 30 minutes.  So overall I'm very pleased!</Review>

<review>The worst. Tons of games here, problem is none work. The theater is almost always off. So I get a kid who is already nervous about going to the dentist now is upset because he can't play any of the games. The service is terrible. I've been here multiple times and they always over book. I have three kids and I schedule them all at the same time for convenience. However they always forget to schedule one of our kids. Then we have to wait longer for then to see us because they over book. I gave this place a few times thinking mistakes happen. However, after a few times of the same mistakes it becomes clear that this is who they are.</review>< time>

I'll give them an additional star for past experiences but this time as I sit in the waiting room I'm asking myself why this place is for kids. One of the big selling points is that it's a fun place where kids can play while they wait and feel comfortable. Surprisingly though, not a single game is working. In fact the area where the video games are is completely closed off. Also, the movie theater has nothing playing. It's just a giant waiting room resembling a DMV office. My son, my wife and I are uncomfortable and unimpressed. I hope the actual dental experience will be better.< /review>

<text>Bunch of crooks they tell you your kid needs all kinds of procedures just for the money, they torture kids,  they perform all kinds of procedures on healthy teeth. My baby it's not even 2 years old, dentis tell me ohh it's because of the formula, and she made it clear that was the reason why most kids get cavities. Ummm my kid is breast fed and they tell me she has cavities on 4 teeth and needs 2 crowns.  So I decided to get a second opinion and she just needed a clean up.  Don't fall for that don't let them cause unnecessary pain to your loved ones.< /text>< time>

HORRIBLE, UNETHICAL CROOKS. DON'T EVER TAKE YOUR CHILDREN TO THIS PLACE. DR. ZAND AND THE OFFICE MANAGER MINA ARE THE BIGGEST CROOKS OF THEM ALL. They will destroy x-rays and other info from their files to get away with charging you for things they shouldn't be. Will be taking this place to small claims court. I have filed many complaints to the Dental Board. I can assure you Ms little Mina will be out of a job pretty soon. And as for Dr. Zand your next. How do any of you sleep at night. The only reason you have a nice office is because you rip off your customers in order to pay for it. Fingers crossed for the next patient that walks through your door.<//Text>

This was the worst dental experience ever and i have three kids!!! The doctor that took care of us had no customer service skills.  He gave us an attitude and was very brutal to my child.  I was asking him very simple questions in regards to the procedure and he couldn't answer the questions.
When you completely strap down a child, from head to toe, how can you tell if the anesthesia is working? She fainted because of the pain.  I don't understand how this is acceptable.
If you care - PLEASE GET A SECOND OPINION!!</review>

This is is the WORST place ever. I took my 5 year old daughter whom I've taken to my regular dentist before with no problem. Unfortunately, my dentist doesn't do caps on children so I went to this place. They put the anesthesia and literally a second later started drilling on her, thankfully I never left the front of the room and saw how they were treating her with no sympathy as if she was an animal. Animals deserve better treatment, I enter the room and try getting my daughter when the dentist pushed me out and threaten to call the police on me AMAZING!! I told her if she didn't let me take her I was going to call the police on her and started dialing 911. Please stay away from this place or your kids will be scarred forever.<//review>

<text>I don't understand how this place is still in business.  They told me my 2 YO needed a ton of work that needs to be done immediately.  Second opinion proved that their diagnosis is fraudulent.  They need to shut this place down.</text>< pictures>

Ortho side has hour long waits.  That's with an appointment. You will be waiting an hour to be called for a 15 min visit. Waste of time<//review>

< review>
I have been coming to Magicland Dental for 14 years, never had any issues until the past year. We come with appointment and they call us 1hr after check in, but today has been the worst we have been here since 9:45am appointment at 10am. They just check both of my kids (2 and 10min after their app time), and just got told that they won't have time to perform my sons cleaning since they don't have time and we need to reschedule. Feeling angry, upset, disappointed and so many more emotions. BAD BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE.< /review>

<Review>WARNING!!!
Do not make the mistake our family did on allowing this place to do braces for your child.
Facts:
1.You are not getting a better price for braces.
2. They sign you up in a date contract.
3. They lack in communication with parent on where you are with your child in the progress of your child's braces
4. They do not have a set schedule of days some days they are closed or are in on the orthodontist side which vary fo Wednesday and Saturday.
5. They have such a high turn over in management employees within a year, that you can't even contest what a previous manager said.
6. They over book up to 3-4 persons for the same time.
7. Orthodontist side is only in Torrance office certain days.
Problems.
1. When you go over their contract price for broken brackets, missing rubber bands this is where they charge you.
Kids break brackets occasionally, and loose rubber bands but the office hours vary so you cannot just walk into take care of situation. Even when if you have an emergency where they do not put in the brackets right and you have a problem literally hours later and you are the last person to be seen.
If you cancel an appointment ahead of time to notify them they don't do something as easy as pulling the childs name in the computer to see that there appointment should not be set up as next available but depending on the urgency of the matter like having your mouth piece put in and tried well by the time they fit you in the teeth have already moved substantially and they have to do another mould fitting.

Please trust me as a mother of two who unfortunately brought my two kids to this place it was terrible stick, without a doubt to a Ortho office that does just braces and is open 6-7 days a week. That know that kids occasionally will break braces bands etc. and gives you a price that includes this figured in when this happens. If I hadn't waited so long the executive offices in getting back to me in trying to settle a partial reimbursement I would of sued them.  For them to get their ratings up they must of hired a social media company to help them because their ratings were always bad. I just didn't take heed.<//Review><name>Kenia elias< /name><Pics>None< /Pics>< rate>

< Review>
These guys are CROOKS!  Don't let the kid friendly colors and environment fool you!  I took my 4-year old son here (five years ago) for a check-up and they said that he had SIX cavities and that they would need to sedate him to do the work.  They gave me the high pressure sale pitch that he had to do them RIGHT NOW.  WHAT??!!  Thankfully we declined the work and went to another dentist for a second opinion.  As you might have guessed, our second dentist did not find anything that needed work.  Now, five years later, my son has still never had a cavity.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!</Review>

They charged me for a service that was covered by my insurance. They claimed that they issued the reimbursement on my CC but it never came through. I have been trying for more than a year to get this reimbursement issue solved with their accounting service but no response so far.
I have been going to this place with my kid for more than 3 years and thy are never on time, the wait is always about an hour even with an appointment!</review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) Write a timeline first
11:00 Appointment time, we arrived early
11:48 into the waiting room
12:12 The dentist started the examination, which lasted less than three minutes, then
After changing the dental assistant to wash the teeth
12:25 leave

Because it was the first time I went to the dentist, I specifically recorded the time. I can only say that the waiting time was much longer than expected, and I will have experience in the future.
The dentist was great. Originally the child was a little tired and anxious after a long wait. The dentist calmed her uneasy soon after appearing. The process of checking the teeth was very pleasant and the child was very happy.
I originally wanted to give two stars when I was waiting. Fortunately, the dentist's examination process was good. I gave four stars. I hope to reduce the waiting time in the future and still accept it within half an hour.

(Original)
先写个时间线
11点00     预约时间，我们提前到的
11点48分 进去里面的候诊室
12点12分 牙医开始检查，持续不到三分钟，然
后换牙医助理洗牙
12点25分 离开

因为是第一次去看牙医，所以我特意记录了时间，只能说等待时间远超过预期，以后就有经验了。
牙医是很棒的，原本孩子在长时间的等待后已经有些许的疲惫和焦虑，牙医出现后很快安抚了她的不安，检查牙齿的过程很愉快，孩子也很开心。
原本等待时只想给两颗星的，还好后来牙医检查的过程都不错，给四星，希望以后能把等待时间减少，半小时内还是能接受的。<//Review>< name>

(Translated by Google) Magic land is a perfect place for children to experience their first dental care. The staff is very, highly qualified and friendly. Dr. Adriana and her assistants, Alexandra and Ana Lilia, were the ones in charge of my daughter's first visit at 3 years old. On this second visit, my daughter felt very comfortable and welcome that by herself she accepted to have her teeth x-rays taken and to my surprise she agreed to have her teeth cleaned. I am very impressed by the professional work and personal care of the little ones.

Magic land es un lugar perfecto para los niños para experimentar sus primeros cuidados dentales. El staff es muy , altamente calificado y amigable. La Doctora Adriana  y sus asistentes, Alexandra y Ana Lilia fueron las que estuvieron a cargo de la primera vista de mi hija a sus 3 años. En esta segunda visita mi hija se sintió muy cómoda y bienvenida que por si sola aceptó que le tomaran rayos x de sus dientes y para mi sorpresa aceptó que le limpiaran los dientes. Estoy muy impresionada por la labor profesional y cuidado personal de los pequeños.🌷🌷🌷</text>

(Translated by Google) Terrible place my daughter wanted to make 8 cavities and two crowns when they told me I did not allow k to do anything and take her to another second opinion and what was my surprise k everything was a lie That is not done to a 6 year old girl As a mother, I am always tempted to clean it and her teeth are safe from those unscrupulous people. K Only money. Care. Parents, alert with that clinic. In my life, I take my daughter back there.

(Translated by Google) Attendees who give the leaves to form forget to say some things that are going to make them extra ... they need more training in treating children ...

Los asistentes que dan alas hojas a formar olvidan decir algunas cosas que les van a hacer adicionales....necesitan más capacitación en tratar niños ...< /Review>
