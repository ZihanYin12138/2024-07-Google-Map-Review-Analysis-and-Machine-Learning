<Review>In the past the sandwiches were really good, when the original owner had the shop. They have not been the same since family members took over.  Now on the #7 you get a single deli slice of ham and thin slice of roast beef, very dry. Certainly not worth $7.00.< /Review>< time>

Really great place. Sandwiches are a great size for the price and they taste amazing. A great place to pick up a quick lunch that isn't fast food. Employees are friendly too which is another reason to keep going back.< /Review>

Was visiting Bakersfield and needed something quick to eat that wasn't fast food. Decided to give this restaurant a shot. I'm so so happy I did! I got the BLT, my boyfriend got the Pulled Chicken and both were absolutely delicious and made with quality meat. Service was fast and accurate as well as super good customer service. Will come again when back in the area!!</Text>

Good sandwiches that I enjoy tasting and chewing so wonderful sauce inside. 0v.!0 so delicious. Also be wonderful with prices and coupons. I would like to add more during COVID19. Today, June 9, 2020, before it closes. We do eat there inside. I was so amazed that city sandwich co would be happy to sell many breads if you want to buy. Cool!!!! So delicious unique salad inside sandwiches. So cute side extra food.<//Review>

Will always come back until the day I die. I even got my boyfriend addicted. I come here often because everything is fresh and absolutely delicious. I get the same sandwich every time and after not being able to go in a couple months, the owner started making my sandwich and told the girl before I even ordered. The owner, his family, and the work family are amazing! My mom used to bring me when I was a little girl and you best believe that when I have kids I will be bringing them here as well! Best sandwiches in Bakersfield!</review>

My absolute favorite sandwich shop hands down. I can't decide if I like the turkey, the deep pit beef or pulled pork the most...they are all so amazingly delicious. They also have fresh bread every day! No other place comes close to their service or prices either. My family is hooked!<//Text>

<Text>Everyone there was friendly, and they made me feel welcomed.
The place itself is very clean, and everything is well organized.
The sandwich was delicious! I don't recall ever eating vegetables in a sandwich that were that fresh! I'll be sure to stop by again.< /Text>< GmapID>

Discovered this place existed back in 2002 thanks to my college coach from BC. I love the flavor of their oil they use also the alternative to lettuce, I think its sprouts. So fresh and just a simple Turkey sandwich is so good! Gave it 4 stars because of the wait. Woth every penny and best choice if you're bored of subway.< /Text>

I realize the bad review posted before myself, was written 2 yrs ago and from someone who specking by hear say alone. Specking as a fairly new new employee of City Sandwich Co. I have to say, not only is this a very clean place to eat at, its owners  pride themselves on cleanliness and great service.
There sandwich meats are fresh and sandwiches made in plane view. There potato salad and pasta side order has to much mustard and vinegar for my taste but there chili beans are great.
More important its not a corporation trying to sell you promotions, its family owned for 32 years and its about good sandwiches, great service.< /text>

The cashiers are always very friendly and genuine and the gas prices here are pretty cheap I come get my gas here every week
Yes it is open 24 hours a day but the system reboots for the next day from 2 AM to 3 AM so don’t use the pumps at that time< /Text>

<username>Thomas Leavitt</username><Text>I've been gaming with a group of buddies here on Tuesday nights for around a decade. The staff is friendly, the floors and bathrooms clean, the food competent; I do the all you can eat pizza and salad bar, and there's plenty of options (even for a vegetarian). There's even a 4 seat bar, so if we want a beer, we can grab a cold one. There's also a couple of different TVs that we can usually get turned off if we want, though they're not loud enough to be objectionable either (we watched the news on election night 2016 while we gamed). It's a Round Table in a strip mall, what else can I say?<//Text></record>

< Review>
Completely horrible experience! I tried to order my pizza over the phone and the guy was totally disrespectful and even hung up in my face. All I wanted was to place a order for a pizza and he gave me such a hard time. No professionalism at all. Then when I asked for a manager, he told me that they didn't have one on duty. I really want him fired. This is ridiculous. He's a representation on your company. Just horrible.</Review>

<review>Friendly quick service! The daily special for the steak burrito was a good deal for the amount of food you get. The steak is flavorful and nicely done. Unfortunately the guacamole serving 2 was very very small for the price. The tortilla chips served were nice and thin.

Tamales de rajas are delicious. Everything tasted fresh. The rice is perfect.  Good selection of salsas that are actually hot (spicy). We would drive out this way again just to eat here. Nice, clean environment. Friendly staff.< /review>

<review>Food is pretty good, but not authentic mexican food. More of a American style, reheated rice, but good service. 15 dollars for a burrito and a soda, not bad for a fancy pollo loco.< /review>< Pics>

Carmen the general manager greeted us at the cash register as we were about to order after waiting in a 15 minute line only for her to tell me we can't order if we didn't have a table we were about to leave and my husband saw all the empty tables outside in the patio and ask if we could eat there, she then said yeah I guess and took my order but I ordered a pozole for my self and a wet burrito for my husband I specifically ordered the burrito twice to make sure she heard it was chicken and I ordered cups for water so she did give me TWO cups but never placed my husbands order! I didn't know until my food came out and we waited and waited and my husbands never came! Mine was a soup so by the time we got a hold of the waiter and asked him for the rest of the order he said it never got placed and we had to go pay and reorder 15 min later his food came with no silver wear! The waiter told my husband to get up and get it by the soda machine! Terrible customer service it totally ruins the food as the environment is that of not needing our business since it's so full! Well first and last time we come here and they better believe we will tell all of friends and family on base and this who come visit the outlets! Awful!</text>

<Review>My family and I were craving Mexican food came across this nice place in the outlets. The food was great, had chicken and veggie soup and sizzling fajitas. The flavor was so unique, I had to ask. Shannon the manager went out of her way, she  was very helpful and knowledgable and told me all about the history and the unique flavors. Highly recommend this place.<//Review>< time>

Why have I never came here before! I've been wasting my time across the street at Chipotle, missing out on this goodness. Ever since we walked in, the cashier was super friendly and patient when we ordered. The chips came out nice and warm, the green salsa from the salsa bar was delicious and the cabbage was yummy. My daughter had to go back to refill our little cabbage bowl a couple times, and the food was great. She got the kids taco and it was crazy filled with steak! My green enchiladas were tasty and the black beans were very delicious. All in all, I was very impressed with this place. I have no complaints... well we did wait for about 15 minutes, but it was definitely worth it. Everything tasted fresh, so I didn't mind the wait too much. Please give this place a try, we're definitely coming back soon.</review>

<Text>Great place to eat after shopping all day. We always end up eating here because their food is delicious. The fajitas are amazing. With three sides it's a meal for two. The taquitos are bomb. Love it
Great customer service and lots of seating.
Clean restrooms for customers.

We will be back soon.<//Text>< pictures>

Employees were friendly and helpful when asked questions about menu items. The food was very good,  the tacos Al pastor had a very genuine flavor... the horchata drink was good....the atmosphere was quiet and relaxing....  I gave it 4 stars because the desserts listed on the online menu were not available. Should update the online menu...  Traveling from Texas and wanted to try something new .. all in all... I would definitely eat here again if I'm back in California.  I do recommend this restaurant... 🙂<//Text>

I was surprised that food was good, im giving it 3 stars as we were not greeted as soon as we got it.  We thought it was a seat down as it is a restaurant.  It was order and pay we kind of look for our own table ourselves.</review>

<review>Menu is light and selections are ample However, service could have been on a higher level though, staff seemed a bit rushed so things were missed when ordering. No big deal breaker because the food was fresh, tasted excellent and that is what you came here for. Enjoy!< /review>< pictures>

Nice build-out. Food is average or below. My chicken on my burrito was too dry. Not a memorable meal. It is conveniently located.

It is fast food-like in that you order at a window, get a number, sit down and wait. We were probably there at a busy time but it was not fast.</Text>

Everytime we come to the Camarillo Outlet we have to make a stop at Los Arroyos. I consider their food a better quality and taste than Baja Fresh. I really like the chili rellenos and cheese enchiladas. My husband likes their carne asada tacos. The restaurant is always kept very clean but I gave them only 4 stars because their salsa bar is meager and they limit you to two very small containers of salsa per person.<//Text>

<Text>Food is fabulous but service on a Sunday early afternoon was horrible!  Not enough trained people to do what was needed. You couldn't even get tortilla chips with our meal because we were told it was a "low priority" to get chips with your food. Who says that?? Tables were not cleaned and people waited with dirty tables until somebody could get to it....< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<Review>While waiting for my family of four to eat , I ask for the restroom and approach to go and the manager on duty stopped me and said that restrooms were for customer only. I did stated that I was going to eat there and she did not move or said anything and I left the restaurant and went to Panera. I felt angry and embarrassed and I will make sure to publicized about this incident to all friends and family.</Review>< Pictures>

The service was fast and friendly, food was hot and fresh.  The taste of the enchiladas I ordered was not the greatest but definitely a good place for being in an outlet mall . Kids like it as well< /Review>

The service is friendly and efficient. Once you’ve been there, you are remembered each time you come back. Andrea and Andrea treat us like family, I really can’t say enough good things!!!!!</Review>< pics>

Los Arroyos offers a good selection of cuisine, including both traditional items, as well as more typical "Mexican food" dining experience. The dining room is small, has ample natural light, and comfortable seating.  Service is fast-casual, with counter ordering and table delivery.

I have enjoyed several of their dishes, including the burritos, chimichangas,  and several dinner "specialties." Their molcajete is quite good. Food is neither bland nor too spicy, and the flavor strikes a good medium to appeal to a broad plate.

As a local, this is one of the few establishments I frequent in the outlet mall area, as I typically try to avoid crowds and traffic.</text>

< review>
Thank you for being inconsiderate and no it WAS NOT THE FLU IT WAS A PARASITE IN MY STOMACH and food poisoning. A stomach bug you get from contaminated meat When people poop and don’t wash their hands. I was definitely sick for two weeks after eating here and have been fine ever since I stopped coming here.

This place is obvious CARELESS of their customers and after placing my review and to see your managers reply back and speak recklessly to me saying I had the flu when I have doctor papers to prove otherwise is VERY unprofessional. Now I see why the bunch of poor reviews on this establishment 😂😂  the workers are rude and telling by the Replies the manager is obviously just as rude too .. let’s see how long this place last ...

Have a good day!<//review>

<rating>3</rating><Text>First of all, the food here is excellent. It is without question the best Mexican food in Camarillo (don't let it go to your head, that's like the best pork chop in Riyadh- Camarillo is a restaurant wasteland). The ingredients are all high quality and the taste is outstanding. I rate it higher than the Montecito location.

Second, this is not a place that caters to locals. It's in the Outlet Mall and likely does not see its customers again.

Which is why I gave them 3 stars and not the five they should get. The food is very over priced. I'm always willing to pay more for good food but $14. for nachos is over the top. I've been going since they opened and the plate of nachos I got today was exactly half of their normal portion. My go to dish at Los Arroyos is the molcajete which is always terrific. Today it was 2/3 the size and they eliminated the shrimp. They've stopped giving chips with their entrees now as well.

I know their target customer is the one time tourist. As much as I enjoy the food, I can't justify small portions and high prices just because they're catering to the tourist/shopper trade and not the loyalty of locals.<//Text>< Pics>

The soft tacos, rice and beans weren’t flavorful and it took a long time just to get silverware and water. Side of tortillas were left off and when asked why, the waitress explained that the tortillas mentioned on the menu refer to the tortillas comprising the taco ?!  Too tired to argue. Not going back.< /Text>

Yes, they are not on the side but actually the taco.  Our tacos are meant to be left with only the meat or veggies so that you can indulge on our homemade salsa bar.  We would love to invite you back to try another dish!  Please email me and I\'ll send you a gift card good at any of our 4 locations.

The food was cold was over priced. It's like a bad Chipotles. You order at the counter. Not a restaurant feal. More like fast food. I just paid $ 33.68 for a cold burrito and queso fundido. It was horrible. When my food was served I asked what about my utensils she said they should be by the soda fountain. I'm like what I thought this was a restaurant not Chipotle. Never come here. Food and service is horrible.< /review>

I would probably give this place 3 stars for not having free chips but the quality of food makes up for it.

Our appetizer chile con queso with chorizo was amazing as were the homemade tortillas, but the rest of our food was not good. Thr chile relleno was cold in the middle it seemes frozen and reheated the rice was gross and cold also. Dont think I'd come back unless it was just for the amazing chile con queso. The wait staff was pleasant and the restaurant was clean.< /review>

Dr. Tiffany is awesome. She is super patient and tries to "visualize" the picture from patients "vision" in patients words which allow her to clearly understand the cause of the problem and provide best assessment and prescriptions.  I had my highest quality and best prescription glasses made via Crystal Vision. Entire staff is super cooperative as well. There latest equipments also make visits super super quick and accurate. Thanks Crystal Vision Optometry Team.< /Text>

Very well run Optometrist from the front office to the testing station and finally the exam.
The doctor is v kind and at every step explains the eye issue making recommendations for improvements. I (and my family) have been coming for 8/9 years and truly value her.</review>

<Text>Service is excellent!  Staff is very friendly and go the extra mile.  If you want an Ophthalmologist that listens to their customers, this is the place.  You know a doctor cares when they want to lower costs so all can benefit.  That's what they do here.  Get a retinal scan for only $20 out of pocket $20 from insurance, and you have an amazing fore-site into your health.  Most institutions would charge $50 or more to cover the cost of new equipment and new technology.  Not here!  Even if you don't require eye care, you can see the health of your arteries and veins which also gives you a glimpse of what could be happening in the rest of your body.  Amazing technology.</Text>< rating>

Dr Truong is always very thorough and professional and friendly. At Crystal Vision they use state of the art technology to give the most detailed and accurate information you can get for your eyes. Their staff is very friendly and very well informed.  I always have a great experience and would recommend anyone to visit this phenomenal eye doctor.< /text>

Great professional care in a clean, highly organised, well equipped with new devices office. Dr. Truong is the most caring and patient physician I have ever met. The staff do their best to ensure that patient is well supported.
I highly recommend Crystal Vision Optometry.<//review>

<Review>I've been coming here for over a decade and Dr. Truong is as good as ever. You will not find a better office in the East Bay when it comes to accuracy, customer service, and overall satisfaction.

The retina scan and high resolution assisted frame mapping of your Rx are great tools that they know how to use right, eye health is never neglected, and the frame selection encompassed all styles.

I have a very complex Rx and narrow face and I'm always a happy patient.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures><Response>{'time': 1611011717424, 'text': 'Hi Martin, it was great seeing you!

Yesterday I decided I was going to go get my exam and thank god I didn’t chance because the staff there now is amazing! I don’t know what happened but it’s like I went to a whole different place than I had last time. Everyone is so friendly and happy to see you and help! Two years ago when I had last gone I was telling everyone to stay away but now I would 10/10 recommend to anyone and everyone! ❤️</Review>< Pictures>

Unfortunately I had to change my medical insurance due to the pandemic. I was not sure who to go to see for my future eye exams so I went through the list of providers that was given to me through my insurance. I came across Crystal Vision Optometry I look them up and read their reviews and gave them a call. My call was answered and the person on the other end said her name was Ella. Ella was very kind and professional she answered my questions and them some. By the end of our conversation I had a good feeling so I scheduled an appointment to see Dr. Truong. When I arrived I was greeted by Ella she asked me to fill out some paperwork and within 10 min Ella had called me in to do some screening of my eyes during the whole process Ella was communicating with me and making me feel very comfortable. I met Dr. Truong she was also very professional  she answered all my questions and I felt she understood my concerns . I did not feel hurried throughout the exam I felt that Dr. Truong was very detailed and the eye exam was very thorough.
I am very happy to have found Crystal Vision Optometry and will definitely refer Dr. Truong and her staff to my family and friends.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>Was looking for a new optometrist after my current optometrist retired....what a great office and staff....very thorough and professional... DR  Truong has a great chair side manner and listens to you......a sad note the company that carries my eye care insurance has recently changed from VSP to Eye Med and that eye care insurance is not offered  Crystal Vision at this time...<//review><gmap_id>0x808fc6422b6fc84d:0x51409a5a8d4fca25< /gmap_id>< user_id>

This was an excellent experience, starting with my initial phone call all the way to collecting my new glasses. I have never had glasses before and was nervous- this staff did an amazing job of talking me through the process, taking care of my insurance questions, and helping me choose my glasses which are a great fit and were a great price.  Dr. Truong took plenty of time with me, was very warm in her demeanor, and thoroughly explained everything as the appointment went on.  I HIGHLY recommend!!< /text>

In 2.5 hours, Dr. Truong was able to both diagnose the issue and lay out a solution. Her patience and attention to detail are unparalleled. The length of my appointment is a testament to her commitment to solving problems as opposed to rushing through a list of patients. Highly recommend this practice.

We do carry a wide variety of frame from standard brands (like Calvin Klein) to high end (like Prada.

Some plans cover more and others less depending on the plan you are enrolled with VSP. We do now carry the Calvin Klein and Calvin Klein Jeans line that is one of the most covered brand for VSP and more affordable!.

What great customer service! Megan came in on her day off and left her anniversary plans to come in and make sure we were able to move in! She treated me and my husband with so much warmth and compassion. Helped us understand how to access our unit, (which we had to get up to with a ladder!) showed us how to us our pin and nifty lock! The process was so smooth and easy. I am so glad we decided to come here!< /Review>

I am in the process of moving and attempting to locate a temporary unit to meet my budget. When I called in for quotes and information, I spoke with Megan. Not only is she extremely knowledgeable and patient, her customer service is top notch. She was able to answer all of my questions quickly and is extremely professional. So much so, I needed to leave a review to commend her service. I can tell this company takes pride in their customers and employees they have operating their business. Thank you.</Text>

<Text>I felt compelled to write this review because of all the changes I have seen. The homeless population has really dropped in the last few weeks. I see the girls that work there are constantly cleaning up and I've seen the Manager there after hours trying to clean up these huge amounts of trash and deserted items. She is pretty strict with the bathrooms, but when I spoke to her she let me know she was working on a way to change the locks so that people can't trash it over night and bathe in it. Thank you Megan and Liz! I see your hard work and appreciate you for always taking the time to explain things to an old woman!< /Text>< gmap_id>

When CubeSmart notified me that they were opening a location close to my house, i jumped on it. i was I was greeted by Krista (general Manager) who was very friendly and walked me around showing me different units. for the past year i have been very pleased with her attention to detail and professionalism. when i would bring up a request, she was always there to provide me with options and follow up on the request. Thank you Krista and Cubesmart for making my storage experience a pleasant one. Andy V.</text>

I did this all remotely from the East Coast.  Everything was done online and anything we needed she made sure it was emailed, and within 5 minutes.

Christa and Liz are very patient and definitely an asset to your organization.  Knowing they have my back if I need anything goes a long way.

<username>Aivy Gold</username><Review>I visited a couple places prior to here but what really stood out was the outstanding customer service and patience from miss Megan. I wasn’t sure what I was going to need firstly but she never rushed me or made me feel like time was an issue. She was extremely knowledgeable and helpful with finding what size unit I needed base on here say. Megan is the best. Thankyou so much<//Review><resp>None<//resp>< user>

< Review>
So my morning started off pretty boring... Go to work, file some papers.... 😩 You know, the usual grind, but then that suddenly changed when I recieved a call from Megan from Cubesmart! Her voice was beautiful and I could tell from our conversation that she has the looks to match.💁‍♀️ Her smile over the phone was contagious and I couldn't help but to smile back.😁 ( You should have seen the look on my coworkers faces when they saw how my mood changed due to a phonecall from Cubesmart.)🤔 Her manners couldn't be beat and I have no idea how she managed to make my day after just those few minutes! Megan's professionalism and courtesies were unrivaled, and without any doubt I can say this gorgeous woman was an absolute pleasure to talk to.🤗

BEST LATE NOTICE PHONE CALL EVER!!!

Thank you Megan 😁.< /Review>

Dirty facility, lack of basic tools, overpriced, and lazy/rude workers. My experience here was so bad that, even though I rarely leave reviews, I felt compelled to do so for this business. (The funniest part is that when I first got a unit here, they begged that I leave them a good review, which makes me wonder about the rest of the reviews posted for them given the stark difference in my experience here). I have a storage unit at a CubeSmart in Las Vegas and the difference between that one and this one are night and day. Firstly, the units at this facility cost double the price of the ones I have in Las Vegas. Additionally, the CubeSmart in Las Vegas is ran by kind and helpful staff who go out of their way to make sure your are well accommodated. The staff here are not only unhelpful, they are just flat out rude - constant attitude and random snarky comments. There are not enough dollies for there customers (a problem that the Vegas facility did not have) and the staff will rudely ask you to hurry up with using them. The facility was not clean once in the entire time I stored there - grimey elevators and nasty bathrooms. The worst was that the staff was so lazy that, rather than clean the restrooms, they put up signs on every restroom saying that they were "broken".  The fact that I had to pay more money for such a poorly managed business is ridiculous. There are far cheaper storage units with better staff and cleaner facilities - do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs.< /Review>

< Review>
While I don't write a lot of reviews, I felt compelled to offer praise when someone/something exceeds expectations. The CubeSmart company, Manager Lizbeth Prado, and General Manager Krista Rangel did just that.

I initially began my "storage experience" with Public Storage, and it was terrible. After a couple months of worrying about my stuff without a temperature controlled climate, a poor office manager who hates her job named Sheila, and run-down storage compartments, I decided it was time to move. I found a CubeSmart near me, and the reviews looked good. Although I had never heard of the company, I decided to give them a look.

Upon entering CubeSmart, the facilities were clean, video monitors were on and working, the units were temperature controlled, and the prices were affordable. The manager I worked with was Lizbeth Prado, and she was AWESOME! She was friendly, super helpful, and got a me a rate that made the hassle of moving all my stuff (again) worth it.

CubeSmart is a wonderful place for storage, and this company has exceeded my expectations for what a storage company should be. They set the bar for excellence.

Thanks to CubeSmart Self-Storage, I will assuredly be using you again with storage needs in the future.

Thanks Lizbeth and Krista! You managers are STELLAR.

From,

The units are super clean, door locks after business hours, music is playing in the facility, the temp is kept cool, and location is great. Krista, the GM, helped me move in and she was amazing! She was friendly, knowledgable, and efficient. She made the experience even better. I felt the rate was fair with the level of service and cleanliness of the space. Super happy with everything so far.<//text>

<review>Magan and Liz were wonderful and very professional. They reached out to inform me regards to possible water leak into my unit which is located underneath AC unit. They took care of the leak right away and asked to comedown to inspect the unit incase possible damage to items inside. Fortunately, the door seal stopped water seepage.

Thank you ladies.<//review><Resp>None< /Resp>< GmapID>

Moved in with the help with Lizbeth and Krista, both amazing friendly staff. Not going to lie i got lost all the time! but thankfully they were always so generous to help my wife and I around. My wife moved in and we were there after their regular hours and they were still very patient and welcoming. Definitely recommending this place!< /text>

<rate>5</rate><Review>It was my first time renting a self-storage unit and Krista was extremely welcoming, helpful, and informative. The service was quick, effective, and left me with a little less to worry about when moving a house-worth of stuff between one home, a storage unit, and the next home. Any question or concern I had about space or pricing was answered promptly and satisfactorily. Beyond setting up the rental, moving in-and-out was easy and intuitive. The unit itself was perfectly sized, secure, clean, and easy-to-access. If and when I need to store next, I shall be looking to CubeSmart!< /Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

In search of storage, met Krista (the general manager) and even at the extra expense it was worth it. She went above and beyond to explain, to show us around. If only more businesses had a Krista. It is also a sweet deal having one month free. I like that there is a/c inside and music is playing and that the doors lock and you can't get in without a code after standard business hours. A bit more expensive than other places but totally worth it :)</Review>

When we showed up we were greeted by Pamela, who ended up helping us find and rent a unit. She was fantastic, answering all of our questions in detail and letting us leave with no worries. This location is wonderful. It is very clean, the units have lights INSIDE the actual unit itself, which is not common from my experience, and the location is in a good area. Very glad we went with this company and thank you Pamela!</Review>

Two knowledgeable and professional women helped me over a 3 day period by showing me the unit, explaining all costs associated with starting a rental.  Also they were understanding That I needed a little more time ro decide about reserving. Even went the extra step to let me know they were in the office on the holiday as well. Showing me the unit was not a problem and Id like to mention I was politely welcomed upon entry of the facility day 1. The unit exceeded my expectations and is crisp and clean and grand.< /Text>

<Review>CubeSmart recently opened near our apartment and since we're moving out soon we decided to give them a chance. We did the online reservation since it offered a discount if you did. The morning of the reservation we received a friendly reminder call. When we arrived Pamela greeted us, she showed us our unit. We were on the fence about the size so she gave us some storage tips and took the time to show us other size units. We then did the paperwork, which wasn't too bad, Pamela made it interesting and we bonded over breakfast #chocolatechipwaffles.<//Review>< userid>

I was able to reserve a space late the night before and check-in/move in first thing in the morning the next day. Everything was smooth, clean and straightforward. The property is gate and felt very secure and they sell locks, boxes and anything else you need.<//Text>

<Text>What a ridiculous thrift shop this is! Super large, stocked like you wouldn't believe. Well organized, and still hard to wrap your head around their inventory. I wish I had more time to poke around, I very easily could have spent a lot more time there. I was most impressed by their little theater room with real movie seats.

Owner was extremely rude. My elderly mother misplaced her face mask and the owner proceeded to call the police on her and kick us out of the store. it was also a disgusting and dirty and misorganized facility like nothing on the shelves was cleaned. Highly don't recommend.< /review>

Very unpleasant experience overall. The owner can be heard all over the store berating her poor staff.  Then when you need to know an items price(nothing is tagged), she berates you for not wanting to pay her ridiculous price(stuff she gets for free).< /Review>

<review>Great thrift store if you don't mind being talked to like your garbage! Been going there for over 5 years have spent alot of money in her store and today was the last time I will ever step foot In that door. I've always found her to be rude and snotty but over looked it but today was the final straw! What the hell use is your stupid discount cards when you cant use them and how the hell does one know what's new inventory when nothing in your store is marked except but by your secret light tool..I think you need to up your medications and learn some customer service!!!<//review><Response>{'time': 1562820919955, 'text': "I'm sorry that you feel this way we have a sign posted on the sale for cardholders that no new inventory is included but as far as the furniture that you have purchased I had recently made a special point to go out of town to find furniture to bring to this area buying it in order to serve my community because we do not have enough used furnitureand as far as being rude I am truly sorry if you felt I was but if anyone would like to come and review what was said I do have cameras it is recorded and you're welcome to review the video thank you and that was new inv.entory again I'm sorry"}<//Response>< Pics>

<Review>This woman, Beverly, is one of the most RUDE individuals I have EVER come across! I went in to look at vacuums one day. I found one I liked. I had seen it at Wal-Mart prior to that. I asked, how much? She gave me a price that was well over the price of a brand new one at Wal-Mart. I told her "Wow! Beverly, I can get it at Wal-Mart for less!" To which she replied..."YOU PEOPLE NEED TO REALIZE THIS ISN'T WALMART!" I said "you're absolutely right Beverly! So, why are you charging Wal-Mart prices or greater?!" I left the store. Never to return! Sad thing is...When I was the director of the Del Norte cash mob, my mom being second in command, we took enough people in there to make them a few thousand bucks! They had just opened. We believed in them! We wanted to help! Clearly there is NO gratitude, memory, OR graciousness! Be well greedy one!<//Review>< Pics>

<Review>If you have a lot of time to look through A LOT of stuff then this is your place. There are several full rooms full and separate floors. The owner seems friendly. It is a huge building so it costs a fortune to keep at a good temp so dress according to the weather outside.</Review>< user_name>

Although this is in my opinion one of the better thrift shops in town, simply because of the variety of items, the women who I believe owns it is incredibly ungrateful. We donated nearly 40 bedframes to her.. which she can easily make more than 500 bucks off of, and never once did she thank us or even seem somewhat grateful. I left a few pieces at home so I went back to grab them and came back right away. As I was gone a friend asked if they could have one before I donated and I figured sure, I'll just grab one when I get back. She was super upset that we even bothered to take one, she nearly insisted that our friend go in and buy one from her. I seriously wanted to take them all back in that moment. Ungrateful much? Don't donate to them, they make sooo much money off of free stuff, you'd think they would at least be grateful or nice about it.<//text>

I have gone here multiple times and they lady always charges so much. I have gotten my daughter some toys and she always charges me over 10 dollars for onexample that makes noise and lights up. I have even had to clean the dust of them myself. I'm sorry but you guys are a thrift store. Try lowering the prices a bit. It's a bit ridiculous. And please put some price tags on stuff and maybe some hand baskets. Good stuff just come down on the price a bit.<//Review>

Really bizarre. There's hardly any price tags on anything, so it makes it really hard to browse. You either have to bring the lady over, or carry an arm full of stuff to the counter. She just kind of makes up the price, refuses to negotiate, and is very rude and impatient.
I asked her if she had any holiday items and she started preaching to me about how she doesn't participate in them, and that "she knows her history".
Very strange owner/store.< /Text>

Pricing is inconsistent. Nothing is priced in advance so you have to take the items to the counter and decide there if you agree with the price they ask for. They don't negotiate much, not even on torn clothing or broken things.<//Text>

<Review>If I could come here every day, I would. Here’s the Batman gauntlet and Batarang my wife got for me. I love it like a child. I’m a regular for comics. Great deals, good stories, free stuff for kids, awesome service. If you don’t stop here you’re an idiot.</Review>< pictures>

This place is so beautiful. The art in here were just beautiful. My boyfriend and I went in just to kill time before going to the movie theater and I am glad we went in. Seeing all the disney art and many others made me want to stay long. The lady in the store was also telling us that the artist have art shows I recommend going because the art work is just beautiful. You need to see for yourself to admire the beauty.< /text>

<response>None< /response><time>1564527434025</time><review>Really wish I could give this a better review because the name is a really cool name for a store and the guy was nice but the store was very disorganized it almost looks like someone's backyard garage sale. That would be cool enough if his prices reflected that but unfortunately his prices are just as high as any high-end comic book store. A lot of the stuff that I was looking at was also either missing pieces or just flat-out broken so you might want to make sure if you're buying something you check on it really really good to make sure that there's nothing messed up with it first.</review>< Pictures>

The original owner Jay is back and though smaller it's still a great quality collectible and comic shops. One of the best reasons to go to the town center. If you want to get in to comics or already collect and need to get a pull file going, go here.<//review>

< Review>
Amazing place! I come here often and have both sold to them and bought from them. Ordered a comic and put a bunch more on layaway(All the Deadpool/Spider-Man Team Ups they had). They held them for me for over a week couldn't have been nicer. Even gave me an extra discount(They had already given me a discount when I had initially paid them up front) because the clerk had said he would give me a discount before knowing what I was there for! Great owner, great clerks, great products and just all around an amazing store! Especially if you are even just the slightest bit nerdy!</Review>

Dream world collectibles in my opinion is a staple of Simi Valley. And it continues to educate the youth.as always from comic books to action figures and everything in between this shop has you covered if you remember it from one of the previous locations and liked it it will surely not let you down.<//review>

We drove out on New Years after visiting a family member at the hospital, my son was excited and when we got there it was closed. However the owner saw my son outside and came and brought him a couple comic books and apologized for not being open. Now that's good business!<//Review>

< Review>
[Good selection, but totally disorganized, poorly managed. many, though not all, of the staff are rude. I really want to go, but the experience is unbearable.]   ...updated: they've changed hands, and now the place is much cleaner and more organized. They've gotten rid of much of their vintage clutter. Focus is now on games and comics. Look for name to change soon. Hopefully the new management well be successful. Bumped from 2 to 4.< /Review>

I have gone here many times and I really do like it. Personally, as an alien vs predator fan, that isn't even 18, I think they have a good variety of items. But keep in mind, since I'm not of age to buy things like this by myself, it is rewarded to me and bought for me from my parents. My point is things here can be a bit expensive. Overall, however, this is a good store.< /review>

<Text>Don't go here if you are planning to get a good deal or any deal for that matter!

I called in to ask if they sold Eternal Masters Booster packs / boxes and was given a price that was double the price of every other competitor both nearby as well as online. When asked why the price was so steep the manager told me it was because their "magic specialist" had recommended that price and it is set in stone. I asked afterwards if it was possible to get some sort of a deal on the packs or boxes if I bought a large quantity and was immediately told (I did not even get a chance to speak an offer) , "nope the price is set" and "I am the manager and these prices is what were going with, people will buy them at these high of a price and so therefor this is what I will sell it at".

I understand you can't always expect to get a haggled price , but when a store marks up a product nearly TWICE that of any other competitor you would think there is some wiggle room or perhaps a better explanation than "I am the manager, this is the price."

Also one friendly tip (I could give so much more but I will highlight this one), don't tell someone "I don't know anything about magic but my specialist has recommended we sell for this price" and then begin to get upset when I ask to speak with the specialist.

It is no surprise that all the other stores nearby as well as online are able to sell their booster packs / boxes when all of them are nice and well knowledgeable about the prices of magic.< /Text>< Pictures>

I love this place so much. Staff is amazing and the owner is awesome. Great deals and discounts prices are where they should be it's awesome. Each time I walk through those doors I feel like I am reliving the past. I am that 8 year old kid with his brother collecting comics playing Yu-Gi-Oh, Pokemon, NES, and collecting and reading comics all day having the time of our lives. Dream World  is my favorite.< /Text>

First time here ordered to go the Shrimp and Carne asada the shrimp were good size and tasty and steak was soft and seasoned perfectly came with rice and beans and salad and tortillas and hot sauce the only thing was the portions were on the small side . My husband got the shrimp ceviche which I tried and it was really good too highly recommend worth the drive we came all the way from Winters definitely going back</text>

<text>It was not as good as I thought it would be, camarones al mojo de ajo, camarones a la mexicana,, plato de bistec or carne asada,, will probably drive extra miles to go to Woodland (other seafood place)for a better dish and about the same price.. waitress never brought one drink I ordered for the kids and she never apologized for it either..It should had been a lot better for the price we paid. The michelada was good..eating outdoor was good because of covid, the environment was great.< /text>< pictures>

There's only a handful of places to get food here, but El Capi has some very good food. They do have non-seafood items as well, but I did not get a chance to try them. I had the shrimp tacos which were Soo good especially with the sauces they give you. I also recommend the shrimp empanadas, and the bacon wrapped shrimp. Stop by if you happen to drive by this town<//Text>< pics>

Just ate there for lunch, for the first time today!  Was delicious!  I’m a foodie and love good Mexican food, and this place filled my checklist!  Food was extremely fresh and our order was promptly given to us.  The little bit of food I had left was brought home because I didn’t want to waste any of it!  Looking forward to going back next week, and was very happy, my son told me about this restaurant!  We ordered the shrimp 🦐 empanadas for a snack, then each bought different shrimp plates that came with rice and beans!  Yum!!!< /review>< Date>

<review>I’ve been eating my was across  NorCal for the past 2 weeks, I seek out Mexican joints with good reviews. So far this is the BEST food I’ve had since I’ve been trying a new place everyday.
Just so you know they are a Seafood Restaurant...they do not specialize in asada or anything else a typical taqueria offers. The shrimp the server recommended was killer; kind of amazing. We also order the shrimp empanadas which also exceeded my expectations.
All in all I’d say you must visit this sleepily little  town for the food alone. My wife was skeptical when we exited the freeway, but the road less traveled had a great surprise for us.
Also, to the staff: sorry about the tortilla lid, an honest mistake. Please don’t judge these gringos, you will understand when you have kids.</review>< pictures>

It may look like your average Mexican Restaurant, but El Capi is anything but! My husband and I live out of town, but any opportunity we get,  we stop by and eat there. We are always greeted by the friendly staff/owner.

If you like Mexican food, I highly recommend it. There is nothing like it! The best Mexican food ever! The owner is a wonderful person and his family/staff are always super friendly and provide the best service. The restaurant is super clean.

We order:

Too bad the office staff is horrible. Dr. Rosen Evan is great. His staff could care less. 20 min holds are usual here. Enjoy
I was even accused of recording the temperature taker today. Lol paranoid much lady? Wow
I'm definitely finding a new Dr after reading these reviews. I see it won't get better.</Text>

<Text>My mother went to a consultation with this "dr" for an infection in her urine. She came to the hospital with a high fever because of the infection, her doctor referred her to the urologist and the medical insurance sent her to "dr" Evans. I went to the appointment with her. I went so I can translate what the problem was and when the "dr" arrived, he asked how she feels and I ( her daughter) answered that she had a high fever due to the infection and when he heard that she had a fever.
He stopped and said "that is the covid. She has Covid" we already had the result of the covid test, it was NEGATIVE but without saying anything else he left us in the room. He automatically assumed that my mom had covid, after we specifically told him the test was NEGATIVE. He then told the nurse that he would sent her the medicine by phone.
I was expecting an apology from this "dr" and I never got one.
As many negative comments say, this "dr" has no ethics or compassion for patients, my mother felt frustrated when she was looked down upon by a medical professional and we decided to change doctors since she always felt fear when arriving at this "dr" office.
My new Dr. with a single visit sent me medicine and it is already 50% controlled.
From now on every time they refer me to a specialist I will verify their reviews so I wont go through the same thing. I do not recommend this doctor he is very careless.< /Text>< Time>

<review>Zero stars !
This is the worst experience I’ve ever had.
Doctors were downright rude rushed and worst temperament  ever. This place books an endless line of patients giving each one seconds to speak with doctor and move along. They are about billing as many patients per day as possible. The wait time will be crazy long and the parking is atrocious. They have parking spaces for about 1/3 of the amount of patients they book.
Staff does not follow up at all so don’t expect any help from them. They have the “ surgery “  area open and used as a makeshift office. Doesn’t a surgical area have to remain sterile and pristine and clean not people passing through all day ? Scary and questionable. Weeks and weeks for treatment. They do not care if you are in pain they see it everyday and completely desensitized. Really awful experience.
If you can find another place to be seen.</review>< response>

Dangerous place to have a primary Dr.
Took me three and a half weeks to get a human being on the phone. Their phones sometimes are not even answered. For days. Weeks. Referrals are never sent for authorization. I am waiting on 4 since Oct, and early Nov.  Before Turkey Day,  I made an appt, that was not needed medically, but was the only way to ask whats going on with referrals. Today, Dec 10, after trying to phone for over 2 weeks, I finally got thru and insisted on speaking to my primary,  PA Jessica,  at 5 minutes to 5. This is what she said, " oh hi, are you ok? " I said yes, asked about referrals and what the heck etc, she says, " everyone is leaving and locking up, I will phone you tomorrow"
Seriously. I wont hold my breath.
Heres my main concern for other patients or myself. What if something bad happens, medically, ambulance comes, or ER, ..admitted. ok.  .all good so far,  right? Now what if the Dr at the hospital needs records or info from our primary. Will the phone be answered? DANGEROUS, IRRESPONSIBLE.
For myself, after well over 18 months with them, Because of their unproffesional follow thrus on referrals, Im not being cared for properly, compassionately,  professionally.
Many of my medical things are so far behind becuz of this practice. My well being is in real danger. I will file a formal complaint with my insurance if I get no call tomorrow.  Oh, the front office girl in Palmdale,  most excellent! The rest of the girls do not speak much english, and are extremely young. No mature seasoned nurses or medical assistants there, just so you know. Most seem to have just graduated recently. Its such a shame, as I really like my primary PA J as a person , a delight. I could go on and on. No hate here, simply frustrated.
Its their last chance for me, and I honestly cannot recommend,  wouldve put a zero, front office Jessica bumped me to a one.
I really hope they get it together.
Bottom line. Dangerously unprofessional.< /Text>

Writing this for my grandfather:

I've been going here for five years, and I got excellent treatment. I've seen Dr. Rami and Dr.Fisher, they are excellent doctors, couldn't desire anything better. Nurses are very efficient,gentle, and kind. Only problem was parking.<//text>

I was referred to this place by my insurance and didn't have many options.  The doctors and assistants are nice enough but the office is tremendously over booked.  It's difficult to tell if the people there cant do their job or they are overworked and/or a combination.  To get a call in is nearly impossible.  If you do get a call in, expect to be on hold for at least 30 minutes or longer.  When you actually show up at the office, your expect to be seen at least 30 minutes after your appointment time but most likely closer to 45-60 minutes.  This is only for your vitals to be taken, then you are sent to a second waiting room to wait for a room to be seen.  A visit that should take no more then 30 minutes takes anywhere between 90-120 minutes.  The doctors there are not there daily, apparently 1-2 days at most so it is very difficult to get an appointment and then to change it is impossible.  If you get sent to get some labworks done, MRI, CT scan, etc make sure to have a copy with you because they never seem to have the results from the labs.  There also appears be bad communication between the doctors because when my staples where to be taken out he did not know if my surgical drain was to be taken out.  I had to wait a couple of hours to see if this was going to be done.  The owners of this medical center need to get more people to work at their location.  Also, they have parking but they never had any parking available and please make sure to have your copay ready because that they do request almost immediately upon checking in with the clinic.</Text>

Consistently overbooked to maximize their revenue. Waiting times go far past appointment times. Office staff is blandly unhelpful when you're just trying to figure out how much longer you'll be watching The View in their waiting room. Doctor saw me for exactly 5 minutes. If you're here, know that you're a commodity in their system, not a patient.</text>

BEWARE!  CAUTION!  AVOID!  STAY AWAY!  RUN!

I waited "3" weeks for my appointment!  That was 3 weeks of pain as I wait to be seen by these idiots!  The wait in the lobby is at least 1 hour by the way...packed to the brim!

When I got in, the doctor saw me for "5" minutes and said, "I cannot find anything wrong with you," despite the pain I had been experiencing for the past 3 months!  Personally, I don't think this urologist knew much of his practice.

You know how you are treated here...you are just another number; which they are trying to usher you in and out as fast as they can with NO real answers!  A complete waste of time!!!

When the quack doctor told me that he could not find anything, he said he would have another doctor from the same crappy place give me an examination to see what he could find.  I was told by the receptionist that they would get back to me once they had his schedule and they would book me...I am still waiting for that call!

Avoid at all cost!</text>

<Gmap_id>0x80c296605e355367:0xcdc9716c8b5f40b2<//Gmap_id><Review>Absolutely Terrible! If there was an option for no stars at all I would choose it a million times. Run,just keep running and don't look back! Being a nurse, I am absolutely aware of the level of competency needed for the position of a med assistant and doctor and this place is lacking severely. The staff is highly unprofessional and I don't think any one of them should be positioned to take care of a gold fish! Neither one of the office women have any answers for you...Ever! The health field is supposed to possess virtues of nurturing nature, but every person in the office including the doctor dismisses your concerns and portrays themselves as careless. This really frightens me because I am now unaware if the advice we were given in our care plan is even credible. And forget about trying to get something easy out of them over the phone! They will keep you on hold for 20 minutes without any explanation and then resume the conversation by telling you they cant help you. Then I question why they are there if they cannot help you?! They will also have you waiting in the waiting room for 30 minutes before they even ask you what your name is! There is always about 6 girls in the front just standing around doing absolutely nothing but having leisure conversation just meandering about the office as if there's not patient's to be assisted! And on top of that, they had the audacity to start eating right in front of me! The facility itself is very outdated and dirty! Very unappealing to the eye. I would never ever come back and I advise you not to start!</Review>< resp>

I spent 3+ (with an appt.) just for a check up. Nurses look like they don’t know a thing. You really are just another statistic in here.

Where to begin, after messing up my surgery date and not getting any sort of confirmation from me of such change, I've been in the dark for months. After numerous attempts to get updates for an analysis, the staff for Dr. Rosen don't call me back for followups and when they do call me, it's to cancel appointments that have been in effect for months. Been needing a followup for an analysis and I can't get anyone on the phone to know what's going on. I know it's not the Dr, but the staff has their challenges. It's been a nightmare so far. It's really like they don't care and it sucks because Dr. Rosen is a really good doctor and somehow I feel like this place could potentially reflect poorly on him if patients can't or won't accept the fact that the staff are a crucial part of customer service. It's very frustrating but I might just need to look for a different doctor.<//review>

<review>Not sure if this Clinic is qualified to even organize their doctor's calendars, nevertheless, patients health. 2hr wait time after showing up to my appointment. Sick, after undergoing 5.5hr surgery. Cannot believe the lack of planning or understanding displayed by this place. I AM NOT HERE FOR A CHECKUP I NEED TO BE IN BED. DON'T CALL ME AT 10:15AM IF I AM GOING TO STAND BLEEDING FROM MY WOUND UNTIL 12:15PM in your filthy waiting room.
I give them 0 stars, not 1, the only reason. I clicked on. 1 star is because the program in Google won't let me post a 0.<//review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Resp>

< Review>
Terrible STAFf! Front end staff lack of customer service skills are so bad. My husband is a referral to their clinic for diagnosising prostate cancer. On 12/23/15 after his exam shows his left prostate gland to be rock hard and abnormal  he was schedule for a biopsy 1/26 (4 week wait). On exiting the desk nurse went over his Rx and prep for biopsy date, all good, right. Well what they did not tell us was we needed to have $800 for his co-pay as the  biopsy  was noting going to be a "regular" office visit. Needless to say this morning we were given this news in a "matter of fact manner", no lure so to speak. They did not offer a payment plan nor did they offer to reschedule  for this coming Friday when I would have the $$. I asked why in the 4 weeks we've been waiting did the co-pay amount not be disclosed to us and yes I my voice was  raise at which point they refused us service. My husband has cancer I yelled, I need to know how bad ...why aren't you helping. I got a laugh and a shrug....a laugh...in my face. Terrible place.< /Review>

< Review>
Today ( 09/19/2016)we have an appointment at 9 am . We went but she say ( Vanessa) you have to wait ! I say how long ? She say I don't know!!! I wait 10 minutes and I went again and ask . She say you have to wait doctor is not here.  I say do you know how long I have to wait and she say she don't know. I wait another 10 minutes and ask , she say you have to wait. After 5 minutes I ask her , can i talk to your maneger or supervisor,she became mad with me . I request again she say supervisor is busy now . I say Anyone here can help me , she became mad with me . I told her my wife have a woman's issue.  She don't care and say you wanna make another appointment? I say I need a report today it's an emergency.  She say I don't wanna talk to you!!!!!!! .
Is there anyone can give me good advice? I am really upset. We expecting our first baby , if assuta medical clinic don't care about patients, we have nothing to do?
I hope management will take care in this situation.< /Review>

Terrible service,  you talk to people in there that have appointment and are weiting 2 hours after the appointment time. They make up excuses like , looking for your file, doctors are in lunch etc. I'm not happy and I'm a paying costumer definately switch clinics as soon as you can.<//text>

<Text>Dr. Jay doostan was the worst doctor I've seen at this clinic. Sat there and talked about my mother (a pass patient) that I got taken away from at a young age. Would not prescribe nor listen to my complaints about my body and mood concerning my anxiety& depression. I kept reminding him this is the only visit I get since I paid cash and had no insurance. Yet he kept responding just come back and I'll prescribe your medication.I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY HE DIDN'T JUST PRESCRIBE IT THEN.Now I have to wait another month before seeing a different Dr since I'm insurancless thank you!</Text></record></dataset><record>

Gosh I regret not reading the reviews before coming here.... the clinic itself is OK regarding wait times, cleanliness,
BUT it's impossible to get any sort of treatment / referral from them, and they do not pick up the phone, or line is constantly busy!!! It's ridiculous. Go elsewhere< /text>

This is the worst medical treatment place I have ever seen. I wish I could give a half a star. If u make an appointment u have to wait a hr or more to be called and another hr after they call u to the back. The the old ass doctor they need to retire his ass for he kills someone. Don't come hear if u want to live<//Review>

(Translated by Google) This place has no attention at all, talking on the phone for an appointment or question is an eternity is like an emergency room an eternity to attend and if the patients arrive they are waiting hours.

It's bar food but not a greasy spoon type of place. Glad this iconic place was not a victim of COVID.<//Review>

We went together during breakfast and I got the roughneck that comes with eggs, pancakes, sausage, fries, and bacon, it was alright. Nothing outstanding about it, the pancakes were all fluff and no flavor. That was my only gripe.</Review><pictures>None< /pictures>< gmap_id>

Good place to grab a burger and a cold beer. They have a bar or booths/tables. They also have an outdoor patio that's perfect for you and your dog. The bugers are good sized and meaty. I'm not a huge fan of the fries however and the onion rings are awesome. The beer selection is pretty good and they offer a giant sized 32oz optionif you're having one of those days. overall good food, good people, and a cool environment make this place worth checking out.< /Review>

This is my favorite spot. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. The service is great, the food is tasty and the beer is ice cold.

It’s not a fancy spot but it’s comfortable and reliable and local family owned and operated.

During covid, they’ve worked super hard to stay open and they’ve adapted and utilized their patio area and done what they can to limit capacity and contact.

Pre covid, they have 2 separate indoor dining areas, tv’s for sporting events, they often have live music, they will host events, and of course they have a patio.</text>

We really enjoyed it! We were there for breakfast, so we ordered an egg sandwich with portabella mushroom and homestyle potatoes with onions and bell pepper and some apple pancakes. The egg sandwich and the potatoes were super delicious, not greasy and perfectly seasoned. The pancakes were good and really fulfilling, but next time I will pick something else instead of pancakes. I took the pics after we start eating,.. :)<//Review>

One of the most delicious burgers I every had...
I didn't get anything exotic, just a plain burger. They call em 'Curly Burgers'. For the same price as a fast food combo I had a scrumptious 1/2 lb of fresh cooked beef.
Oh, did I mention that the fries were  BOMB, BOMB<//text>

American comfort food! Not to mention, the Moose Drool on tap. Always a bonus for those that like brown ales. Nothing on the menu has disappointed me. Excellent service, excellent quality! Highly recommended!<//Review>

Ice cold beer. The small beers are large and the large beers are so big I can barely finish one. Food is greasy and delicious -exactly as you would hope bar food is!! Courteous staff, old bar feel, and a patio. Awesome happy hour prices too!< /Review>

Only restaurant I've seen with not one, but two working oil pumps in parking lot.

Friendly staff, good beer and food selection, and a fun vibe.</text>

< Review>
I wanted to share a history I I have with Curley or as we used to call it Curley's. My mother, Odette, used to cook here in the 1930's!  As a child, I performed with Disney and did appearance with Bob Hope and Danny Kaye. We ALWAYS went by Curley's after the appearances for a burger and Shirley Temple for me! A true institution, with the best customers around! BTW, Odette was fired one night for having a drink behind the bar at closing time, but she was hired back the next day!</Review>

<review>Having lived just down the road from this Signal Hill institution for more than 15 years, it's odd that only after having moved a few miles away I would be drawn in to routinely dining here.  So, what's up you ask? For years  My parents and some good friends of theirs have made Wednesday evenings at Curley's apart of their routine. Although often invited, It was so routine that nothing seemed pressing about joining them. That was until my fine folks retired to Oregon and now seeing them was far less often and no longer on a whim the way I was used too. So, when they came to town and were wrapped up in catching up with old friends you can bet that Wednesday evening they were heading to Curley's. This was an invite I couldn't pass up, and now more than ever understand how good company, along with excellent food, served by one heck of a personable waiter named Jason and awesome live entertainment for a reasonable amount were so compelling. This is traditional diner food served in portions and prepared in a way you don't find often these days. The entertainment is usually a duet banjo and tuba with vocals from both mixed in. Usually American standards from the 1920's (roaring 20's) with sing a longs (lyrics provided to every table), the crowd of anywhere from 20 to 60 people are welcoming and a jovial bunch, and the atmosphere is so infectious it's impossible to imagine anybody not joining in for a thundering chorus of "she'll be coming round the mountain, when she comes". On evenings when the duet isn't available they are covered by the likes of a very talented Barbershop Quartet, or a sit in artist. But if this kind of "all in" audience participation live entertainment isn't exactly your thing, no need to hesitate; the front dining room and bar are left to the charms of what ever commentary patrons may have to what ever sports game is being aired on the TV monitors where there is no expectation of participation. The food and service are well worth giving Curley's a try. I regret waiting over 15 years to find out.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Everyone was really friendly.  The live music was pretty great, too.  Their guitarist really captured the feel of 70s to 90s rock.  We had an amazing time and plan to go back.  The parking lot was a little small, but there's a lot of parking in the strip mall next door.< /Text>< date>

<text>I adore this little hideaway.. It's a classic spot, and it gives ALMOST a dive vibe, which I like... The beers are cold and the wings are tangy! I've been here at least a dozen times. Once, my appetizers came still half frozen which was a bummer but only once I was ever disappointed. Good service, cold beer and that old joint atmosphere.<//text>< pictures>

Flies inside, loud atmosphere, broken down booth by the entrance door, sticky table & cold food. I do not recommend kids to go inside because of a total bar atmosphere. We'll not return.<//Review>

<Review>Curley's is great. It's been around forever since I moved to Long Beach. The beer is always super cold. The food is really good. Went there for breakfast had the steak and eggs. Colleen got the special they had chicken fried steak and eggs. Loved it give it a try you'll thank me later.</Review><response>None<//response>< Pictures>

We went for breakfast and the food was great!  The sausage patty was awesome!  The waitress could have been a bit friendlier, but when we started a conversation she did warm up a bit.  Overall, it was a good experience and we are going to go back.< /Text>

Eat there several times a week with three different groups... retired police officers; Signal Hill Rotary Club;  and the Owls Club ... we enjoy the service and the food. Former colleagues coming to town all know where old friends can be found.</Text>

<Text>We had a party of four adults and one child last evening. The food is always great, as my wife and I eat there often. We love Curleys; however, looking at my bill this morning, I noticed that they added an 18% gratuity to our bill of $91.16 or a total of $106.15, with tip.
Usually a tip is added for party’s of 8 or more and is stated on the menu. The waiter never told us there was an automatic tip added and I gave my usual 20% tip on top of $106.15.
I feel the waiter should have told us of the automatic tip. What restaurant automatically adds an 18% tip for only 5 people?
Everyone better check his “Curleys Bill” for the automatic tip. I know I will.......that is why the One Star Rating.<//Text>< pics>

'Mr. Hitchcock, owner of 2H Construction and Curley's Cafe in Signal Hill, has been coaching girls' soccer at Stanford Middle School for one year.  Hitchcock's sixth grade and eighth grade daughters are involved in soccer, basketball and track at Stanford. So Hitchcock knows personally the profoundly positive influence middle school sports can have on young lives.  It is for this reason that Hitchcock has so generously offered Curley's as a location to host this event.  For Hitchcock's community service I believe Curley's deserves a great review. Information about the event can be found here</Text>

That being said, I ordered a 32 oz beer that was very cold and a $11 hamburger that was pretty damn good. It is a 3 star bar with an extra star for descent food and very cold beer. FYI, if it is a busier night, parking stinks in the crowded , small parking lot.<//Review><Pics>None</Pics>< Rate>

Full disclosure: I play in a traditional/dixieland band at this establishment as a guest musician on Monday evenings. My wife accompanies me and enjoys a delicious meal and conversation with other diners who come to enjoy the music. The server on Monday nights who attends to the needs of guests on the music side of the cafe is top notch. She is friendly, fast and very helpful in making sure everyone is satisfied and is a credit to her employer.<//Review>

<Review>Delicious food. Quick serve. Friendly environment and a nice place to get a pint of cold beer. Sunday's are a perfect time to go and enjoy a big juicy burger and onion rings. Thank you Kathi for the amazing hospitality!< /Review></record>

Not great, not terrible either. Teriyaki burger was ok. I requested onion rings "lightly fried" -- they were burnt.  I ordered cold slaw instead; it was bland and nothing to write home about. My sister enjoyed the albondigos soup though.<//Text>

It looks enticing from the outside, but when you get in there it's so hot I mean have you heard of an air conditioner? So besides being sticky and humid we went outside those nice was a nice breeze we ordered two delicious Bloody Marys. Well the Bloody Mary's were far from bloody they were shity Mary's might as well as tap water and a tiny hint of V8.

So the bill was like 50 bucks we got one appetizer it was soggy quesadillas the only thing they had going for them honestly it was the onion rings I'm going to give them that things are delicious! Other than that nasty</Text>

Surprisingly pretty food with big hearty portions. Not the most appealing decor inside n out and more of a bar restaurant then cafe. Variety of items from breakfast to dinner and appetizers. Beer is served here and Curly's also has plenty of TV'S 2 watch sports n news.</text>

Well, its a diner and bar with TV's.  The food is medium quality diner food, but the service seems to always be good.  This is NOT the place you visit for anything resembling a culinary experience,  but rather basic food so you don't go hungry!< /review>

Great food, decent prices, good service.
The Bistro burger, and Curly's morning martini are amazing. Would definitely recommend if you're in the Long Beach/Signal Hill area.<//text>

(Translated by Google) To start parking is another independent business and you have to pay $ 100 pesos if you want to use it.
The policy of the place is that they do not serve alcohol before 2; 30pm ... BS
