< review>
I like it because it's local but it's expensive compared to other beauty supplies and they don't allow returns or exchanges..

I don't like doing business anywhere I can't return or at least exchange an item... I bought hair for braiding that I ended up not being able to use because my braider said it would cut her fingers....It was never opened and I had the receipt and they wouldn't let me bring it back so I'm stuck with five packs of hair that I can never use...

If it was a wig or something I could see, but something in a package that has clearly never been opened you should at least be able to exchange!

This is a policy that is typical of a lot of Asian Merchants which is why I don't do swap meets and don't really like to patronize them because it's not the American way...

So due to their no exchange policy, I will not be shopping there again..<//review>

This is an Asian run store. Very clean...small and enough parking 2 get the job done. Very friendly people. I like prices checking.
Some of their prices r lower on certain items while higher on others.That seems 2b true with all such stores.</Text>

I've been searching for a wig store around my house for a while now and decided just go in here on a whim. Man, I'm so glad I did!! They have so many different types of wigs available-and they allow you to try them on (with the purchase of a $1 wig cap) which is awesome since not many places let you do that. I went in looking for something very specific-a yellow lace front wig and I mean a bright yellow. Instead of just telling me no they didn't have that, they actually took the time to look for some wigs that were similar. Despite not being a bright yellow, they ended up showing me one that I really loved so I went ahead and purchased it! They have this stamp card too that once you purchase 4 lace wigs, your 5th one is 40% off which is pretty cool-and I know I'll use it since I'm always buying wigs! I was really nervous going in here that the service wasn't going to be that great or that they wouldn't have anything I liked, but I was very impressed with this store. The customer service was amazing and their selection of products was huge! Besides just wigs, they also carry a ton of different beauty supplies like hair care products, make up and others things. Definitely my new favorite beauty supply store. I highly recommend it!<//review>

Wish I could put 0 stars but unfortunately that isn’t an option. So I bought a wig from there that was supposed to be human hair. When it came down to dying it & bleaching it, nothing happened to the hair(mind you it was a profesional that has worked doing this for over 20 years that looked at this hair & tried bleaching it). She told me it WASN’T human hair ! Don’t buy wigs or bundles or anything from this place because they sell fake stuff y’all! Don’t waste your money, & be careful what you buy because they will not refund or exchange anything<//Text>

<Review>I really liked the store until my experience today. I work across the street . But we didn’t have the product that I wanted so  me and my coworkers usually go there. So I wanted to buy a cap and apron, the cap prices at $3.99.. what a deal! I was going to buy them both with my discount. But the guy that’s always in the front ignored me when the girl rang me up and the cap price was different. I kept calling the man in the store that walked away from the girl and told her to charge me what it rang up. Not the price that was advertised. We then are going back and forth I tell him you have to honor the price advertised. He then begins to tell me Walmart make mistakes to you still go there... I’m like no that has nothing to do with it. He then goes to where the caps where and removes the price tag and tells me he’s going to fired the guy that did this. Again, that has nothing to do with me. I took a picture or the price tag earlier. He got mad after I showed him the picture, and said he was going to call the police! ( for what) I said do whatever you want. I told the girl at the register to just ring me up for the product I initially came in for and forget the apron and cap! He wouldn’t do it nor give the discount displayed for even that!! And asked me why I took the picture and he was calling the police!! And to go to my work and get the product.!!  I’m done!!!  Very ignorant, unprofessional, Unacceptable Behavior!!<//Review>< Pics>

I went here last week for earrings and immediately felt welcomed, I bought one item and they were quick to sign me up for a beauty4U card for future discount purchases , I didn't feel lost. I got help from one of the employees,  It was a nice store with a variety of supplies. I definently plan on going back soon for some hair stuff .<//review>

Manager has a horrible attitude, wigs feel like Barbie doll hair, & sell nothing but cheap stuff. Save your money or go to the place on el segundo and Hawthorne blvd in the shopping center instead</review>

<review>Any time I am near Atascadero I make a point in stopping at La Parrilla and I almost always get at least 1 barbacoa taco. Absolutely amazing. Beer, horchata, chips and salsa bar. They’ve got all the necessities. I Highly recommend, they make the food fast.<//review>< response>

<text>The food was not what I had asked for however, it was good.  I mentioned it to a gentleman who was very understanding and offered the next burrito to be comp.  I really appreciate his professionalism and is often most important.  Came back and tried again.  Very friendly order process.  And the food is fantastic.  This is a fabulous place to eat.  More than 5 stars.< /text><Resp>None< /Resp><user_id>109093562545532668959<//user_id>< rating>

<review>Mexican food so good I decided to marry the owner! In my unbiased opinion, La Parrilla is the best on the Central Coast. I hate driving to North County BUT 100% worth the drive! The menu is huge, definitely something for everyone!<//review>< Name>

<Review>I ordered chiles rellenos for pick-up. To my surprise when I got home not only were they under-seasoned/bland, they were stone cold and tasted as if they had been frozen previously. I wasn’t able to enjoy or even finish my meal. I doubt I’ll be ordering from here anytime soon.<//Review>< date>

<text>First time trying and the order was wrong. I wanted  a breakfast burrito, asada burrito and asada fries to go. What i got was an unknown meat burrito, a partially right breakfast burrito and asada nachos. The woman working the counter seemed to busy and worried about clean so she could go home.
Update: issue was rectified by the owner and will give it another try.<//text></record></dataset><record>

Ordered a california burrito today from this place and the fries inside it tasted like there were old. First Time trying this place to and what a disappointment. Waist of money. I tried so many other California burritos from different places and this is the first one that left me disappointed.<//Text>

Food is delicious,flavorful and we'll balance. I enjoyed their deep fried barbaqua tacos with dipping sauce. Also, a plate of chille rellano, beans and rice and horchatta drink. Staff are friendly and a clean place. I recommend this restaurant if you visit the city and for the locals.

Great food!! Thank you!! ❤</Review>

We LOVE La Parilla. It is one of our favorite spots in Atascadero. Everything I have tried here has been absolutely amazing. I crave it all the time. One of my favorites is the Chicken Burrito Bowl. It’s a must try! The service is incredible. The staff is friendly and attentive. The restaurant is clean and welcoming. I cannot express how much we love this place!!</Text>

<Review>Best Mexican food on the central coast!

Something for the casual Mexican food enthusiast (California burritos, carne asada tacos, etc) as well as an awesome assortment of authentic Mexican foods for the diehard fans!

Great customer service. Quality food. Really making a mistake going to any other Mexican joint on the central coast!

Try the Birria tacos!< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><Response>None</Response>< GmapID>

The cashier was really rude , she didn’t let a couple eat because she need it the table for a big family. Couple decided to cancel their order. The really looks bad at least for me not to come back here .</review>

Can’t drive through north county without stopping at La Parilla. Everything on the menu is amazing, really easy to get to lots of parking friendly staff. The best salsas you’ll find in the whole county and they aren’t stingy with handing it out! Do you want your burrito hand wrapped tighter than a Cuban cigar? La Parilla. Going to the grocery store but now that you’ve done that don’t want to make dinner? La Parilla. Are you too white for spicy salsas? La Parilla. You want so spicy you cry? La Parilla.</Text>

Tommy at Manhattan Beach e-bike rentals was a consummate professional! He put us at ease walking us through the process on how to use the e-bikes as first timers. He allowed us to get set up and helped prep the kiddos, as well! We had a wonderful experience and the bikes were outstanding! We received compliments all day on how great the bikes were, and we agree! Money well spent.</review>

This new e-bike rental shop is awesome!   Great location for easy parking, access to bike path. Bikes are super easy to use and brand new! Staff very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend Manhattan Beach E-Bike Rentals.
Five Stars for sure!</Text>

My dad came up for the day from San Diego and wanted test out a E Bike for the first time before purchasing. We were walk-ins, Tommy (The owner) greeted us and was so friendly. He filled up complimentary water bottles for my dad and I while he wrapped up with the group in front of us. He went over the all the different styles and helped us figure out what would be the best fit. We spent the afternoon cruising to Venice - had a blast and now my dad wants to purchase one!  Highly recommend this shop if you curious about the E Bike experience!</Text>

We rented for half a day and made it up to Venice taking the strand. These puppies flew, we could have easily made it to Santa Monica as well. Recommend this to anyone that wants to cover excellent ground on bike and not stress about it. So rad!! The shop is super clean and renting is super easy. 10/10<//Text><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>None< /Resp><gmapID>0x80c2b34eb3c44283:0x88a878e30768c5d0<//gmapID></record>

I went to test ride a radwagon before buying one. The owner of the rental store was so friendly and helpful. The process of scheduling and paying for the rental was online and super easy. All in all it was an easy, awesome experience!< /Review>

My wife and I came to Manhattan Beach E-Bike Rentals to rent their Rad Power Bikes and cruise around the strand. The two guys helping us out at the shop were super knowledgeable about the bikes and patient teachers. We had a blast cruising down the beach on these bikes and are considering purchasing a couple for ourselves. Great experience</Review>

On April 29th I took some time out of my day to Google a bike shop and Google landed me to this bike shop. The 1st thing I noticed is that it was clean, 2nd was that there was no chipped paint, bikes well kept and all looked clean. Tom (he is who helped me) his customer service was on point. He made eye contact, he explained everything in detailed and he made me feel comfortable doing business with him. Today is Saturday  May 1st and guess what, I AM GOING BACK, he has earned my money and service. I have found my new like for coming to the beach.<//review>

Wow, love this place! Great location, super clean & organized. Great inventory. Tommy (owner) was so helpful & generous with his time & knowledge. I would have bought a bike from him if I could. Rad Bikes should hire him for a high level position because service and knowledge like this are rare. Can't wait to buy my e-bike!<//review>

<Review>What an experience! The other day, my granddaughter Allie and I rented two Rad bikes and the experience was unbelievably good.  Tommy set us up, gave us detailed but easy to understand instructions and we were on our way to the MB bike path.  As it turned out, the only regret was that we had rented the bikes for just an hour.  Tommy's instructions were perfect and on point with everything from using the pedal assist function to (later) telling us about the "walk" function for scaling the steep street to and from the rental shop.  This shop is a dream for both novice and expert riders.  As noted above, Tommy's instructions were pitch-perfect, the shop is clean and well-located.  And best of all: they handle the Rad Power Bikes--easy to ride and a pleasure to learn.< /Review>< Pictures>

100% BEST day ever!
**Tommy the shop owner greets you by your first name! 😊
**inclu. helmets, lock and water bottle**
**the bikes are easy to use.
They give you full instructions and you can tell the inventory is cleaned and well maintained.
The location is at the top of the hill from the bike path.
**do not ride the steep hills if you are not experienced ** walk your bike!!
Of course it’s nice when the bikes are new and fast. But the service is also important to me.
I truly felt like they appreciated my business.<//text>

The e-bikes are virtually brand new and a smooth comfortable ride. Conveniently, I was able to make a reservation less than 2 hrs before pickup. It's quite nice not having to pedal all the way back to the store to return the bike. I may even purchase an e-bike myself.

The business owner is personable and a likable guy. Overall it was a pleasant experience and I'd rent from them again. Highly recommend!<//review>

<review>Rented two radcity bikes for a full day. Tommy and Shane were very kind and helpful in explaining how to use the bikes. These bikes are pretty amazing and they worked phenomenal. We spent a day riding from Manhattan to Santa Monica and back. All the equipment worked perfectly and we were really impressed. Great service, great product - highly recommend. We will certainly be back again!< /review><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x80c2b34eb3c44283:0x88a878e30768c5d0< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

This is the place in the Beach Cities
to rent an E-Bike!!
Great Equipment
(Bikes are Rad Power Bikes)
The personnel were friendly, knowledgeable and helpful making sure everyone knew how to operate their bike. The business and bikes were clean and ready to go, the pickup and return was quick and smooth. It was the BEST way to show our guests the Beach from Manhattan B to Redondo B with very little effort. We definitely will be back!
Our Friends could not stop talking about how great a time they had!

Great place to rent electric bikes.  We tried the RadRunner and RadCity bikes which had tons of power.  You can use pedal assist or just relax and use the throttle.  We took them up to Palos Verdes and had a blast!  Renting and returning was simple and Tommy the owner was more than helpful.  Two hours of use and it barely put a dent in the battery.<//Review>

<review>MB Ebikes is great!  The staff is super helpful. Tommy answered all my questions by phone a few days prior to our rental.  We reserved online and completed the waivers online so all we had to do when we arrived was get a quick tutorial on how the bikes worked.  They gave great suggestions on where to go.  We were celebrating our daughter's birthday with a trip to Marina Del Rey for lunch with family so it was really important everything went perfect.  The bikes were new and worked great.  We highly recommend renting from this great new business! 5 stars plus!< /review>< Pictures>

Fantastic experience riding their E Bikes. A family run business and it shows in how they treat their customers. Passionate and knowledgeable about their product. Affordable pricing and right near the Strand so it’s easy to get to other places from there. Strongly recommend using this business!</Review>

<Review>If you're looking for a really fun experience in Manhattan Beach look no further than Manhattan Beach E-bike Rentals. The owner, Tommy, was fantastic. He made the whole experience painless and fun, and the bikes were a blast. Great way to venture out in the South Bay with friends and family. Highly recommend.</Review><Date>1605981463338< /Date>< Name>

This electric bike rental facility is fantastic! The husband/wife owner team go out of their way to make sure you feel welcome and have a great time! We rode the path to tour a local college! Campus was closed, which did not matter to the kids as they were having a blast on the bikes. We arrived back at the rental shop and enjoyed telling the owners about our adventures! Thanks so much to a Manhattan Beach E-Bikes! You far surpassed all of our expectations!<//Text>

We rented electric bikes from this new shop and rode north on the Strand to Marina Del Rey and back, stopping in Playa Del Rey for lunch.  Fun time.  The bikes were great. It was a comfortable ride, even on the hills.  The battery power was excellent.  Great service and easy to get in/out of the shop.<//text>

Bikes are new, easy to fit, have strong ebike locks with each bike (fit right on the bike). The bike path is easily accessed. I would recommend going south towards Redondo Beach about 6.5 miles. Coming back we cruised through the neighborhoods. The boardwalk was vibrant, good restaurants and very safe.<//Review><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

Great place to rent electric bikes.  We tried the RadRunner and RadCity bikes which had tons of power.  You can use pedal assist or just relax and use the throttle.  We took them up to Palos Verdes and had a blast!  Renting and returning was simple and Tommy the owner was more than helpful.  Two hours of use and it barely put a dent in the battery.< /Text>

Can’t say enough about Tommy and Manhattan Ebike Rentals. First, no where does any bike rental company stock Rad Runner bikes. I own two ebikes, one foldable both other brands. But Rad made my finalist list each purchase. Great to have the opportunity to ride them. Tommy’s price point is terrific, particularly the 4 hour rental for $75. These beasts will hold plenty of battery charge for the full four hours! Combine the best ebike rental with great access to miles of bike paths along the best coast that LA offers, and this place is where anyone in LA should come for a great day long adventure. If you haven’t tried out an ebike yet....heres your best chance to become obsessed with ebiking like I am!< /Review>

Strongly recommend this amazing shop!
They specialize in RadPower bikes and offer amazing service. All of the rental bikes are brand new, lots of choice between different bike models,  great additional gear like helmets, locks, baby seats etc. The owner is really helpful and will go out of his way to offer you a great riding experience. The RadPower bikes themselves are great as well. We have tried the RadCity StepThrough and the RadRunner which were amazing for the hilly streets of MB.
Very reasonable pricing is a huge plus!< /review>

<Review>I rented the RadRover and it was a blast! Bike was in perfect condition and made quite the statement on the bike path. Had out of town guests and we had a great time riding to Marina del Rey for lunch and then back up into Redondo. Was a great way to for our friends to see the area. I'd highly recommend any out of towners to stop by and rent some bikes for an afternoon.< /Review>< pictures>

<text>I am a regular customer there because they always offer me more than anywhere else and they are super nice guys. They remember me every time I go in. They work hard to give their customers the highest price they can because they want to make you happy so you'll keep coming back. I've sold gift cards, gold and silver there and have came out with more money than I expected to get everytime. I love that they are open late too.

These guys are solid from my experience and as long as you're not being shady, you call first to ensure they take your gift card they'll get you covered at the best percentage rate and they're pretty cool too. If you're hurtin on cash it's a good back up to have.< /Text>

THE BEST CASH FOR GOLD IN ORANGE COUNTY, they have great customers service like they actually make sure I'm happy before I leave instead of just low balling me. If you actually want a quality deal for your gold then I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED you come here. they take good care of me every time I come in, it feels like we are actually working together. DO NOT GO ANYWERE ELSE U WILL GET LOW BALLED TRUST ME, come to CELINE JEWERLY BOX</review>

I have also brought other items,  and they treat me better here than any pawn shop or anywhere else I've been to, to try and sell things I'm not in need of.

Was referred to this business from owner of Hillcrest Smog, after learning their smog tech passed away. Was very effecient, fast and friendly. Very affordable, and in and out in less than 15 minutes. I was there at opening, so that could have been a factor.< /Text>

Fast and easy. $36 if you fail, $45 if you pass. Pretty fair deal. There was a bit of a line this morning but once it was my turn, I was in and out in 10min. Would highly recommend L2.</Text>

Love this place. Fast, affordable, friendly. No frills, but who needs them when your smog check takes 5 minutes?</Review>

< Review>
This is the best place to get a smog check! I have kids toddlers I need to be in and out fast. Every time I have had to come get a smog I’m in and out in under 10min! Super fast and friendly service!
Definitely recommend anyone especially mothers with children.<//Review>

<Response>None< /Response><Review>Was traveling west bound on I-80 at about Clipper Gap when i came across the path of Reliable Auto glass truck, both of us traveling above posted speed limit when all the sudden the driver brake checked me at 75 mph... got next to driver and he proceed to blow kisses at me like it was funny he just endangered mine and my families live and his own. Called to complain to company about driver and person i spoke with was very nonchalant especially when i bought up that i was gonna leave this review.

My wife got a chip in a brand new window (installed by Reliable) and I drive in to get a repair.  Expecting to have to set up an appointment for a later day, I was thrilled beyond words to have my window fixed, insurance taken care of and on my way in 20 minutes.  I LOVE it when things work as they are supposed to.   Well done, Reliable!< /Text>

<Review>Friendly people, and a good price. I called and was able to have an appointment as soon as the next morning. Installation didn't take too long. My only issue/complain is the installation technician left a big black handprint on the interior. Even after a decent scrubbing, the mark remains. I have included a picture of said print. If not for that, I would have rated 5 stars.

Update/Edit - The owner reached out to me the following morning after my initial review and made it clear he would do what ever it took to make things right. I definitely appreciate his willingness to correct the issue. Updated to 5 stars< /Review><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipM5Rfz4-ZyzENaZOArr3hoM8HGMbNqw8H5x3kXM=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics><username>Dylan Patterson<//username><Time>1559939862896</Time><Gmap_id>0x809b703eb4a2a295:0xcc16f6605a05b7a1</Gmap_id><user_id>116016443143087538279</user_id>< Rate>

<Text>The gentleman that came and replaced our windshield was amazing. He spent great time and effort and making sure not to make a mess and cleaning up after he was done there were no glass chips in the car we had no butyl all over our Dasher all over the glass like I've had from other glass companies there aren't really that Safelite.
I highly recommend you stay away from the large corporation glass companies and help your local glass company that uses the money to put food on their table pay their employees and not going into a bonus for some CEO sitting on the top floor of some building in Chicago.
And their prices are amazingly competitive and beat all the major glass companies you see on TV every 15 minutes.
I highly recommend you give John at Reliable Auto Glass a call and I know you will be happy</Text><rating>5<//rating>< Name>

<Rate>4<//Rate><Text>Update/edit: The owner reached out and apologized for the damaged and offered to replace the damaged part. As for the smoked top portion, apparently there is only green/blue available for my vehicle which wasn’t communicated when I had asked multiple times about. So as for that I’ll bump it to 4 stars. As the rest of the experience was good.

Won’t go back. I asked on countless occasions and was told it would be done, for black smoke tint on the top 4” and I ended up with blue. They broke my driver side window deflector. On top of that they didn’t clean up at all, I found my dash covered in black dust.</Text>< pics>

Caught a rock-chip while driving in GV and could not get into the other big company.  I was worried I would not get a quality job or that service would not be as great as the other guys, however, I was pleasantly surprised by the service I received.  The office manager was very friendly and they got me in and out in dash!  Thank you!  GREAT SERVICE ALL AROUND!< /Review>

<text>Today, called for status on parts delivery, ordered two days prior. Customer service rep acted like they have never talked with me before, very specific car model/parts and prior vehicle business.   Told I would be called right back. End of day, no call.

<Review>Friendly, polite and professional customer service - and a wonderful job on the windshield. I thought I needed a completely new windshield due to a leak but they found the real issue and fixed it! They also filled a chip so well I can hardly find where it was.</Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Resp>None</Resp><gmapID>0x809b703eb4a2a295:0xcc16f6605a05b7a1<//gmapID></record>

<review>Broke my windshield unexpectedly headed home from yuba city. Stopped into reliable auto glass to set up a replacement date. I was so surprised to hear, not only were they familiar with my model of vehicle. But they also had the glass in stock!!! Hour later I forgot it ever happened! Thank you reliable for your kind and helpful staff! Will definitely be back!!< /review>< Pics>

<text>I couldn't be happier with Reliable Auto Glass and Brian who installed my new driver's side window. Prompt, professional, and more than half the cost from my other quotes.

<Review>I thought Troy of Reliable Auto Glass was awesome. I was late be cause of traffic that I had not anticipated. He guided me around to the back of the place and got right to it. John helped me through the AAA process which was a challenge with background noise. Thanks guys!< /Review>< pictures>

<user_name>jatate47< /user_name><review>Many thanks to Troy (and John) at reliable auto glass for fixing my 2000 Toyota Tundra.  If you ever need auto glass or a leak fixed, (mine was leaking inside the cab,) here is where you want to go!  Troy went above and beyond to make sure the leak was fixed right the first time.  The old leak was done with very shoddy installation and caused the area under the windshield seal to rust.  Troy took the time to wire brush and primer the affected areas.  I don't know of any other glass shops that do this!  I highly recommend this shop and their technicians!    Their prices are super affordable too.  I'll be back for my auto glass needs.  Happy holidays guys.  Joe Tate<//review>< user_id>

Outstanding service. I would encourage any of my friends who need auto glass service to use Reliable. They are excellent about standing behind their work and do what it takes to satisfy the customer. That was my experience.</review>

<text>I've gotten awful service from these people. The guy that showed up to replace my windshield was disgusting and filthy dirty. I've had to call them back since then because the stripping at the bottom of the windshield started peeling off; they fixed it once and now a few months later the same issue is happening again. I left them a message on a Sunday saying they need to fix the stripping again, leaving all the info they needed and my phone number. The message was ignored and I had to call back later Monday afternoon. I would  never recommend Reliable Auto Glass to anyone.<//text></record></dataset><record>

I would like to express the great customer service I received from the Auburn & Grass Valley stores; both stores were professional & helpful. Having my windshield replaced the same day I requested their service was above what I expected.</Review>

The Tech showed up late, left the music in his truck playing loudly, I asked him to turn it down so I could hear him.  He told me the problem with the glass, and I repeated what he said so I was sure I understood.  He yelled out "What are doing? What are you doing?"  And was dirty and rude came across as adversarial.

I left, told him to FO and he prayed for the Blood of Jesus on me as I drove off.

Should be called Religious Jerk who wont fix windshields.

If there were zero stars, that would be my choice.< /Text>

<Text>This 9 hole disc golf course is an Oasis surrounded by industry and city. Power lines, radio towers and several cell phone towers mark the perimeter of the course, which is a large bowl of grass and some trees.

While the park has trees, Culver City Oil Fields is the dominant view in the distance. And a pocket of West LA and Downtown LA.

Some decently long holes.  Holes 2-4 are heavily pock-marked by ground rodents and has large areas of holey dirt and mowed dead grasses.

There are a few beautiful Huge oak trees, and the course is clean and well maintained. 9 holes are fairly easy to find.

It's not pretty, nor is it challenging, and the course is exposed to wind and the entire park is pretty busy around sunset.

The throwers are rushed, like the people in this city. There are picnics and wanderers inside the course area, to watch for if you have any wild guns throwing in your party.

The high rating is due to lack of other course options in the Los Angeles area, not the creative challenge of this course.

The Good:  It's a real 9 hole course and it's in the West LA area. Good for beginners/intermediate.< /Text><user_id>114896264612751979681</user_id><user_name>Boulder Studios< /user_name><Rating>2<//Rating>< Pics>

Big fan of this course. 9 holes going back and forth across the top of the park. All par 3 from about 200 ft to 350 in length. Some good elevation shots. There can be some pedestrians who do not understand disc golf but overall pretty open. Parking costs money but playing is free. Usually not too crowded. Have only had to wait a couple times to tee off. Concrete tee pads, not the best signage to point your way but its hard to get super lost. Would recommend.</text>

This is a hidden gem of a disc golf course within a larger multi purpose park. I had no idea it was here for the longest time.

As someone that grew up playing disc golf, it’s nice to know to know I can play near my residence in Marina Del Rey now.

There’s only really 9 holes, that’s my knock down from a 5 star park. Oak grove and Huntington Beach both double the size. Still a cool spot especially for the Westside.</text>

Nice big course.  Great views of the city.  Lots of walking amongst oak trees and expansive lawns. The Saturday we attended there were a lot of people playing the course so it may be the case that your games bump into each other There is a persistent onshore breeze which will have an affect on your game.<//Review>

The teas are marked clearly with a metal pole and map of each hole along with the distances and par. The course is varied with long and short holes, downhill and uphill, between trees and open fields. It's only nine holes, but for an urban course this is to be expected. There is even a 500 ft par four.</review><rate>5<//rate></record></dataset><record>

The most interesting part for me was the number of gopher holes! Kindof an extra change to walk on tht uneven gopher ground, but a fun SoCal ecosystem to experience.< /review><Pictures>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipN_C8kO4zF0TFEf6S_zHN5jpBGJEhEfq8W5tnyH=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</Pictures><resp>None<//resp>< gmapID>

The store is big, clean, and the employees were nice. However, the natural dog food we spent 160 on made my puppy extremely sick! It’s going on two days now and he hasn’t eaten any of the food that has made him so ill but his symptoms haven’t gone away. Now he needs a vet visit. Not happy with the outcome of the food that’s supposed to be all natural!< /Text>

At my request, she recommended a great vet in Fair Oaks, and shared insights on spaying/neutering, vaccinating and other hot topics.  She also gave me a great magazine (Dogs Naturally) that I’ve read cover-to-cover.  She obviously cares deeply about animals, and she’s a wealth of knowledge.  Also, the store has a great selection of quality products.  I will most certainly be back!< /Review>< pictures>

The brand of puppy food has been difficult to find the last few months and Bens has come to our rescue. Happy to have a location so close to home that has our pups food in stock. Also love their customer service. They wouldn’t let me carry the bag to my car, they did it for me and that’s amazing!!< /Text>

Great local pet food store! I stopped in here a few weeks ago as I have an adult cat who likes to barf food up on random occasions no matter how many foods I tried. The associate was SO helpful and sent me home with 4 samples. All 4 samples were great for my cats so I stopped back in today to pick up a full bag. Today's associate was helpful, kind, and new information about the products. I love that they have a rewards program and she even carried the food to the car for me. We will be back!<//Text>

I'm so glad that I found Ben's Barketplace! I have significantly improved my dog's health. She suffers from several food allergies. The people at Ben's were able to help me change her diet for the better. They are extremely knowledgeable on both cat and dog nutrition.  I found cat treats that my cat actually likes! I had begun to think that was an impossible task! I highly recommend Ben's,  if you have some special nutritional needs for your animals or just want some good advice and excellent pet products!</text>

The employees are very knowledgeable and can make credible recommendations.  Also, we recently brought our 2 dogs for a bath and do they have a state-of-the-art washing area!  So clean and easy to use.  They stock all the products you'd expect and then some.  I can highly recommend Ben's Barketplace.</text>

I have been purchasing from Ben's for 5 years now. They are VERY knowledgeable on all the products they have in stock. If it is healthy pet food and they dont have it (which is rare) they are always accommodating. Anywhere I got in this area or surrounding areas, they will always have my business!<//Text>

Excellent service; Over the past six months, they have learned my buying habits for my Rottweiler who has many allergies so only one kind of Instinct dry food works for her.  They ensure that they always have a large bag on the shelf or in the back for me!  This is Customer Service to the max.<//text>

Ben’s associates have always been a ton of help and very educational. On my most recent visit I asked the owner (I assume) many questions about dog food. He gave me the run down on going completely raw my dog is one happy pup! Can’t recommend them enough. It means a lot when someone actually takes the time to explain things, and genuinely values your animal’s health. Thank you!<//Review>

Undoubtedly the BEST pet food store around. I have been desperately trying to find a dog food that 1) will help support my immune suppressed yellow lab and 2) something he actually wants to eat. I’ve seen Ben’s Barkplace in Lincoln and have always thought it would be an overpriced, hoity-toity store... Yikes, was I incredibly wrong. I went in on a whim, out of desperation, and came out with more knowledge, suggestions, and resources than I’ve received at some vet’s visits. Christina & Chris (aka “Big Time”) were amazingly attentive, inquisitive and knowledgeable, as well as invested in helping me problem solve. The dry kibble I left with was less than $12 and my big fur buddy LOVES it. Absolutely, recommend this store. Thank you for your help in keeping my best buddy healthy from the inside out. ❤️<//Text>

We dont go anywhere else for dog food or treats. Brad & Sally (the owners) have helped us out so much over the years. I highly recommend Ben's. Your pets deserve to live a healthy life. You either spend a couple more bucks on good food or thousands at the vets trying to figure out why your pet is sick. Keep them healthy. Go to Bens!</review>

It's a good store, beer is cold and good prices. No complaints, one additional detail, their beer is fresh (Not old, bitter taste as the other nearby store).< /Text>

< Review>
The store was very clean. It wasn't filled with tourist garbage. Prices were all clearly marked, which is nice. Others stores nearby will charge tourists double. The prices were all pretty fair too, especially with how close it is to the park.< /Review>

1/1/2020- Per Eddie 'tell the truth about me' ok then Eddie should get off the phone once in awhile when his customer is standing there.  Employees are Great! Alcohol variety is large and some unique choices like Hazlitt Red Cat, 'de-lish!'.<//review>

I live near by and accepting my visa/debit isnt allowed even though its mine and I had proof of id with it!! Old asian lady is stubborn and just trying to make you use the ATM to withdraw cash and only use cash in their store.

Its really unpleasant because she seemed nice at first but to tell me I can't use my card even though its a dollar to use ATM cards,,,, such a Rip and bad business... To be down the street from DISNEYLAND :?
GO TO DAY & NIGHT MARKET. they are friendly with a GREATER selection.
How is this place in business still, its 2017..,< /Review>

Went in there every day for a week, guys behind the counter were always nice, prices are great, get your stuff here instead of the rip off hotel lobby.  The place looks shady but it's really not.</Text>

<Review>I go here sometimes for scratchers. People constantly come in and out of here without face masks although the sign says "No Entry Without Mask", indicating this policy is not effectively regulated or implemented by the employees or owner(s) there. Unfortunately, this place is notorious for not cashing out scratchers and lotto tickets depending on who's cashier and what time you go. I take this gamble each time I go there. Nothing much else to say. This place isn't good sometimes, and it isn't bad sometimes. I mean, it's a store, so if your looking to buy something (and not looking to cash out lotto tickets or scratchers), then this place is open.</Review><Pics>None</Pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

<text>William provided a thorough examination of the existing very old furnace and A/C, and came up with several options for a new Heating & A/C device.  One Hour has provided great service so far on a repair call and I look forward to working with them more in the near future.  Thank you for taking the time needed to provide options for us.  William is Great!! 5 stars< /text>< Pictures>

Jeff Cecchin came to estimate the installation of a new forced air heating system for a split level house I have listed for sale.  He is exceptionally knowledgeable and was able to come up with a creative solution for bringing heat to the various levels of the home.  I only call Jeff for my my clients’ heating needs!<//review>

Service was absolutely fantastic. Jesse Phillips was, by far, the best service technician we have ever had from your company.  He did far more than anyone else you have sent has ever done. He was extremely thorough, friendly, professional and punctual. I would like to request him to be our permanent service tech.  He should be the one that trains all the others. Please use him as an example when you hire future people. His service makes us very happy that we are with your company.< /review>

Anthony came out and checked my AC. He was professional and seemed to be very experienced. He found the problem and explained it to me in layman’s terms where I was able to understand the problem and the steps to get it repaired. I felt comfortable with his explanation and appreciated his upfront disposition. Overall it was a good experience.< /review>

<Review>While I have not yet decide whether to pursue the projects that I had One Hour provide a bid on, I was blown away by the professionalism of Mike Stone who came out to look at the project and give me a quote. He is incredibly nice and very knowledgeable. While he was out to give me a quote on a new system, he actually tried a few things to fix it and answered all of my questions even on things that were not related to the HVAC work. He also let me know that one of the possible projects would not make economic sense to do. If I go through with the project and their bid is even close to my other bids I will go with one hour because of mike.<//Review><Response>None<//Response><Name>John Robinson<//Name></record>

He did  inform us that the transformer had burned out and replaced it which cost $500. And that an electrician would need to assess the incoming wiring.Luckily my neighbor reviewed all the wiring and found the problem was simply a fuse which although had not burned out was the source of failed voltage and one replaced every thing worked fine.< /Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

Dennis was fabulous: on time, articulate, thorough.  A pleasure to have him here.  One Hour is a terrific service - they have maintained my heating and air conditioning for years.  I have been a carpenter and builder most of my life, so I understand the trades but don't do HVAC - I don't need to thanks to them.  My highest recommendation.<//Review>

So I had to schedule another service call, and Evan Plant was the Technician who responded on Sun.  He spent about 3.5 hours working on my HVAC.  Had to order some parts, and returned today (4May21) to get me up and running.
Initially, there was a little bit of a miscommunication with the scheduling office, but it got resolved.
In regards to the (2) Technicians who responded, I have nothing but good things to say, especially Evan.<//Review>< Pics>

<review>GREAT TECHNICIAN!  Very friendly and took their time to do the work correctly.  The overall cost was a bit pricey and it would have been nice to have the service charge deducted from the work and parts.  Other than the cost, I would use them again.  This was the 3rd time I used this business since 2017.<//review><pictures>None</pictures>< Response>

<Review>Bigham's One Hour Heating and Air Conditioning is a great service provider for HVAC services and support. Today, we needed service for our RUUD Heating system, and Jesse Phillips of One Hour arrived, on time, in very professional manner, and did a great job digging in and diagnosing our issue. I appreciate his assistance and One Hour overall. He was able to dial in exactly what the issue was, performed an extensive diagnostic of the system in general, and I'm very pleased with all his help and support. Thank you Jesse and One Hour!!</Review><Response>None</Response>< name>

Mike Stone is AWSOME!  Understanding the problem with my furnace and
its electrical system, diagnosing its problem like a medical specialist!
I took his recommendation for a complete diagnostic service checkup
and signed up for regular servicing by the company. My furnace had not
been well-cared for by previous owners of my rental property which
caused premature aging of the system.<//Text>

Anthony,

Serviced our furnace. He was a very professional technician. His demeanor was polite,  patient. He was very knowledgeable of the inner workings of my furnace and answered all of my concerns. After several days without a working furnace it was appreciated. Since this furnace outage occurred two days before Thanksgiving to me it was my best early Christmas present. Thank you very much Anthony T. of Bigham's One Hour Heating & Air Condition. If you want it done right ask for  Anthony T.</Text>

Hey everybody Mike did as much as he could to rectify the no heat that we had experienced the last few days.  He was able to get the heat going (it has recently stopped working) and also order a part to correct the situation.  Great service and a great experience, it will be even better when we are warm.

I was very happy with the service, they were the only ones who were able to come out the next day, which is important when your heater isn't working! Kam was very nice, professional,  and helpful. He explained everything that was going on with the heater, and got it working for us. He even called and asked if he could come earlier than our window of time, so no running late. I would use this company again!</review>

He explained in detail the work he performed and gave me suggestions on how to increase the life expectancy of the units. He was very polite and followed all Covid precautions.<//text>< Pics>

I understand the work to be completed is variable, and there is no way to tell what the cost for that work will be.

They know what it costs to send a technician out for an inspection. Why can't they just disclose the cost so I can share it with my client. They're required to pay for an inspection, but what they'll pay is a secret. Service is fine, customer empathy is missing.< /review>< time>

<text>I needed to replace my heating and air conditioning systems. After researching the systems available and comparing consumer ratings of the products, I chose to have a representative from Bigham's One Hour Heating & Air Conditioning come out to my home to discuss the project and to provide me with an estimate. The representative made the entire process go smoothly and in addition to our basic needs for air/heat the representative customized the systems according to our needs ( by a whole house sealing of our existing ducts to insure that the heat/cold air does not escape from the ducts before reaching the air vents and by adding an air scrubber to maximize the cleanliness of the air to help my husband's asthma issues). The representative also helped us with financing and setting us up with a maintenance plan to keep our systems running in tip-top shape. It's been a whole year and I am enjoying how well the systems work and how quickly the heat and air reaches & maintains our desired temperatures. Additionally, my husband has far less breathing issues.<//text>< pictures>

Always on time, pleasant.  Leaves me secure.  I am 80 years old so I need to know that I am safe and secure, and I will be with heat.

August 2020
Today, Senior Technician William Sage, came to repair our air conditioning unit the was only blowing hot air.  It was an issue with the circuit breaker.  He took care of it and also found a rodent issue with our duct work.  He gave us a variety of alternatives and set us up with someone to get rid of the rodents.  He was extremely knowledgeable and helpful.

July 2020
Anthony Torres, from Bigham’s One Hour Heating & Air Conditioning, did a great job repairing a minor leak in the piping of our air conditioning unit.  He replaced a small section of piping in the effected area and was done quickly.  He was courteous and professional.</review>

One hour beat all the other estimates for installing a new 5 ton system. Everyone else wanted me to settle for a 4ton. They brought a coil that would not fit in a very tight space and quickly sent for another while continuing to demo/prepare for the new system.
My new AC was a God send and was installed right before several heat waves. My house remained at a cool 76 while it was 104+ outside. SO glad I had it done, and with such a professional business.</text>

Mike is awesome! Very thorough during his visit and made sure we understood everything that needed to take place in terms of next steps. His expertise really helped me in making my decision on which vendor to choose to repair our AC unit. Highly recommend!</Text>

Bart and the crew were very timely, professional and informative. Called when the a/c went out in the middle of a heat wave.  Turns out furnace and a/c needed to be replaced.  The crew worked as quickly as they could and were very thorough. In addition to replacing the furnace and a/c, they sealed and cleaned all air ducts, making the whole system more efficient. Very happy with this company.<//review>

We reviewed what the issue was briefly over the phone. Once they arrived we talked through things and he asked for me to turn on the unit to see it run. The unit turned on and both inspected  it. Both the fan and compressor were running, with the issue that the unit was not producing cold, Jesus checked the refrigerant pressures and found them very low. They recharged the unit and found the low side valve was leaking by. The unit was working well when they finished up.  Thank you for the quick response.</review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<name>Eddie Silva<//name><Rating>5</Rating><text>William came out to diagnose our AC problem only to find out that the builder installed the wrong equipment, dual zone vs single zone. We would not have known this without Williams help. He provided a proper estimate and something for me to bring to the builder since our house is less than 8 years old. He also came out next day after I called for help even though the next available appointment wasn’t until Wednesday (today is Sunday). I really appreciate Williams service and the responsiveness/professionalism of William and this company! Highly recommend.<//text></record>

Highly recommend! We’ve had a lot of experience with renovating and building properties over the years. We were very impressed with their consistent responsiveness, immediate proposal, dedication to quality, knowledge and professionalism. Jordan was great to work with and Mark and his team did a great job on install. And they’re all nice people.

Quality, professionalism and expertise at a reasonable price.</Text>

I've used them twice and while their service is certainly not cheap (so far it's always in the upper range of the price you'd see while googling), they've done a good job each time. They are also very professional and explain to you exactly what's going on.

Edit: They recently quoted me $1,100 to fix a stuck induction motor. "Apollo Heating and Air Conditioning" came by and fixed it for $350. So I'm knocking down the review from 5 to 4 stars.</Text><pics>None<//pics><Response>None</Response>< Gmap_id>

<Text>Imagine the horror of hearing your lost cat mewing from an air vent on a Sunday afternoon!  I called the guys at One Hour and they were here in less than an hour, and didn’t leave until they found her!!  I was so relieved, I could barely breathe while he crawled in my narrow crawl space, and finally I heard a muffled.....”I found her, is he a beautiful Russian Blue? Come here, beautiful, he said”.....how awesome is that!! And, he said, since his team “let” her get stuck in a duct, they would replace it all, free of charge!

Our furnace failed on March 16th shortly before the coldest period of the winter/spring.  The furnace had a sticker from One Hour and I called.  A technician was dispatched and provided me an explanation and written quote.  Our funds were limited and after reviewing our financing options, One Hour agreed to work with us to get the furnace back working.  George came out and promptly installed the new thermostat and repaired the furnace.  After more than 10 days without heat, it felt great to be warm and comfortable.  George was very efficient and on time.  I highly recommend this locally-owned company.  We will use One Hour to service our air conditioner later this Summer.< /text>

I helped PG&E create its incentive program for HVAC maintenance, so I'm familiar with this area both as a customer and a professional. My experience with the recent heating system maintenance visit by One Hour Service technician Vincent Racendez was five-star! Not only did he address all the items on the One Hour checklist, he explained in clear terms what he found, what he did about the discrepancies, and why. Then he took the time to answer my questions about converting my gas heater to heat pump heating (to reduce my carbon footprint). No "upselling", just the facts about  what it would take, the pros and cons. I was very confident in his assessment.<//Text>

The technician arrived as promised on time. Ryan was professional and obviously knew his stuff very well. He also not only patiently explained what he was doing and why. He also went above and beyond in recommending routine cleaning of the unit inside and out and demonstrated it by performing the cleaning after he completed the maintenance tasks.<//text>

Ryan came out and inspected our heater and air conditioner units, He was through and explained what he saw and what he was doing as he went along. He made a couple of minor repairs and even changed out the filters in the house. Would definitely us them again and would highly recommend them to friends and family< /text>

< Review>
My Air conditioner went down during the heat wave. My home warranty could not find anyone to come service my equipment. Saw One hour heating & air on yelp and gave them a call. Even during what was probably one of their busiest times (heat waves always are) and on top of COVID they got someone out to me in 2 days. Greg was the technician and all I can say is WOW🙂.
I was truly impressed. He was not only able to identify the issue, had the part on the van, and while waiting to be sure unit came down to temp, cleaned off the coils, and cleaned out the leaves. He also checked the refrigerant charge as temp differential was not exactly where it should be, saw I was a bit low and fixed that as well. All for a great price. I have used many companies for HVAC over the years and none of them have been even close to this diligent, an. Greg was a phenomenal technician and is a great asset to their company. I will use them again and I highly recommend them.</Review>

Bigham was very prompt in answering my call,  arranging a date to come over.  They arrived on time and did a review of the problem with my air conditioning unit.   They discussed the possible solutions and pricing.  Once agreed on the solution, we scheduled a date to get the work.  They arrived on an agreed to date, called before they arrived to make sure I was home.  Once finished the reviewed the work done.   Excellent work,.
Excellent company.  They were very professional and I will use them again< /Review>

Bart and the team were great! Having anyone into our home at this time during Covid is nerve-wracking, but the crew were respectful of guidelines and also ready knew their stuff - they fixed our furnace professionally and knowledgeably, and at a reasonable price.

<review>We have had a wonderful experience with One Hour! We had a miscommunication at first about if they were able to replace a thru the wall ac unit since it might be better done by a handy man or contractor. But despite being told that they couldn't do the replacement, they figured out a way to do it for us. And once the old ac unit was removed and we discovered that the hole in the wall was too small for the ac unit sleeve, they still figured out a way to do it! Great service and dedication to the job, excellent quality, and we couldn't be happy with the end result! Jordan and Jack were the two people we worked with and we highly recommend them both!</review>< Pictures>

This firm gets an A+ for communication, calls promptly returned, e mail (or text ) confirming appointment, who is coming with techician bio and what time they are coming and follow up  on How Did we Do. Techician was excellent at explaining what was wrong and the options available.and once installed giving   instructions  on how to operate  the new system.

< Review>
Greg just finished the semi-annual service of our heating & air conditioning system (we replaced the original equipment that was installed in 2003 with new Day & Night equipment).

I let him know that our A/C unit has been very noisy lately and he assured me the compressor was fine and said the noise was from housing vibrating-he installed isolation pads and is running less noisily. However, since we had very little space at the side of our home, he said the more vertical Day & Night fans tend to be noisier since they spin vertically and not the more common horizontal position.

He then moved on to checking the air handler, heater and filter condition (all located in the upper floor/attic. He said everything was functioning great and was done with the service.

I appreciated his willingness to discuss the A/C noise problem and some air balancing issues we have between the floors/rooms. He also was responsive when I asked him to put on "booties" when going to the upper floor.

All-in-all, a pleasant chap and another reason why I continue to be a 1 Hour customer!

Ray and Jesus did a fantastic job of cleaning our ducts and installing an Air Scrubber.  What a difference already. Showed up on time, left our house in immaculate condition and were all smiles (even though it was the hottest day of the year).  I highly recommend One Hour Heat and AC.<//Text>

<Rate>5<//Rate><review>William is great! He arrived on time and explained very clearly what the issue was with our A/C unit, repaired it and was very helpful in explaining our purchase options for a new A/C unit since our current unit is 17 years old.

William was very mindful of observing social distancing and wearing his mask. He was so pleasant to chat with and very patient in answering our questions. He certainly represents OHH in a very positive way and is another reason we’ve been doing business with OHH for over 20 years!</review><Pics>None</Pics>< Response>

<text>Great Company. Exceptional service when it came to every concern, inquiry and warranty repair. I purchase a full system with electronic air filter and scrubber. System had issues with both the heater and scrubber at different times. Repairs were completed on each issue within 48-72 hours depending on parts availability. No complaints here.</text><UserId.>114012033058734860528<//UserId.>< Rate>

<Date>1591309005253<//Date><rating>5< /rating><Text>When your air conditioner beaks down and its over a 100 degrees out you REALLY appreciate a quick response.and turn  around time. This firm gets an A+ for communication, calls promptly returned, e mail (or text ) confirming appointment, who is coming with techician bio and what time they are coming and follow up  on How Did we Do. Techician was excellent at explaining what was wrong and the options available.and once installed giving   instructions  on how to operate  the new system.  We were very pleased with the service and look forward to a cool house and a problem free unit, but if not. we appreciate the company has 24 hour service.< /Text>< pics>

Update after install: Brian was also very nice and helpful, felt bad for him that he had to install furnace and ac unit by himself but he did a good job. William was very nice, honest and helpful.

Mike is very personable, friendly and efficient - he makes a good impression and is a great ambassador for the business. He answered all my questions and addressed my concerns about various other issues.  He made some suggestions which I will follow through with in due time.  He remembered being at my home before to clean the dryer duct although my memory is not as good - but I believe him!  I'm glad I have the 'Home Protection Club' to rely on good people like him.</Text>

We had an awesome service tech!!!  Our A/C quit today. Our house was 97° and rising with the outside temperature at 108°.  Fortunately, we were able to get Same Day service!  Thank you Ryan Philips for being so dedicated to your job! He was very friendly, kind, and professional.  He stayed until he got it up and running, even though it was getting late.  Thank you so much!!!< /Review>

Mike Felker was courteous, personable, and informative! He conducted a thorough examination of the air ducts, taking pictures as he went; even going into the crawl space. He answered my questions and provided me with a review of his estimate and gave me printed information. Thorough and professional!< /Text>

In the middle of extremely hot weather, our new air-conditioning system was not performing properly. We placed a call in the evening and the next morning William was at our house at 7:30 AM. He promptly found the problem, explained what had happened, and left us happy as can be.</Review>

< Review>
4 hour window of arrival for technician . It's a hour after the scheduled time no call, no arrival. Call the support desk and ask for a manager and got told that I would be called back "soon" . Your motto is "1 hour heating and plumbing arrive on time or you don't pay a DIME" yet, your representer said they'll waive the $87 fee for the arrival of the tech . This is where you run into a problem , as you are late and I will still need to pay for the repairs. So, technically I'm paying more than a dime. My appointment was scheduled one week ago .

Update -the operations manager gave me a call and spoke to me about miscommunication and was deeply sorry for the inconvenience and unprofessionalism .<//Review>

<Review>John B., the G.M., is a dedicated professional with lots of experience in the field. He has built a solid team of quality people and knowledgeable techs.  The new Fujitsu mini- splits system they installed is working well to cool our home even on the hottest days.  William S. was the latest example of a great tech who knows his stuff and satisfied our needs. I would recommend One Hour HVAC.

Robert, is a very, very knowledgeable professional. The Company and its owner Paul B. stand behind their work. These guys are HIGH integrity people.

Anthony T. is a pro. He really knows what he is doing. He was on-time, diagnosed some issues previous techs did not spot. I would recommend.<//Review>< pictures>

One Hour Heating's technician, Jordan, was on time, very articulate, and, thorough in his inspection and explanations. He took numerous photos of the system and explained them. He outlined options clearly. I found his visit to be helpful in every way.  Perfect. Couldn't have asked for more!</text>

We had a confirmed appt set for the other day. We received a text the day prior stating the rep will be at our house between 2pm and 4pm. I arranged to take off work. Waited and waited.
However, their representative never showed up. I waited  until 4pm to call their company. They told me he would not be coming and it would be along while before they could come back out.  Needless to say we are very disappointed and will never recommend their service.<//Text>

DERRICK SATELE did a really accurate and professional job, when he came to this house on Feb. 22, 2020.  We decided to go with a total replacement of our 22 year old furnace, and Derrick’s careful analysis, and comparison of replacement vs repair, made all the difference in our decision.

Not only was Derrick knowledgeable, and professional in his work, but he was very personable, too.  At every step in the process, he was friendly, honest, and professional, and did not attempt to push our decision in any particular direction.

We are hoping that Bigham will make Derrick our regular yearly tune-up man.

Thanks for everything....

The guys were personable & professional. George Cortez figured out the source of our problem after an initial assessment & listening to our complaint. He was the first of 3 HVAC companies to correctly access our problem.
Thank you.</review>

During the very busy Thanksgiving weekend,  the heating technician fixed our heat the day before Thanksgiving and cleaned our heating system completely on Friday.   Now it works perfectly.   His estimate was right on.  He was very professional and was pleasant to work with.<//text>

I had no heat and it was Friday Dec 21st I didn't think anyone could help me.  Then I spoke with Daniel and he was able to schedule a tech to come out diagnosed my heater problem. My heater needed to be replaced couldn't be saved. The tech then was able to contact another tech who could install new heater that same day. How grateful I am that these guys came so quicky. The company had exceeded customer satisfaction.
Thank you so much< /text>

<Rate>5</Rate><text>March 31, 2021 update:  No annual A/C maintenance visit in 2020 due to COVID-19 issues, which is understandable.  But on March 6 I sent an e-mail to Bigham's, requesting their lost experienced tech for my upcoming 2021 visit, since the 2019 check found a full pound low on R-410A refrigerant.  So I was worried that my now 6-year old system might have a refrigerant leak.  The good news is no leak found, refrigerant charge was still full.  Bigham's tech concluded that when system was installed in 2015 a small leak in the outdoor compressor's Schrader valve was missed.  Since that valve also has a cover cap with its own gasket, it took 4 years for enough refrigerant to finally leak out to cause an undercharge condition, meaning that my central AC was working a lot harder than it should have.  Valve leak was apparently fixed during the 2019 visit, as part of the refrigerant adding process, so 2021 visit found still full refrigerant charge and proper operation.  Kudos to Bigham's for sending one of their most experienced techs, Mr. William Sage with 26 years of HVAC experience, and for his thorough check and explanation.  I continue to be a satisfied Bigham's customer and a Home Protection Club member; the membership cost for having annual checks of my central AC, furnace, and electrical, is well worth it.

Sept 18, 2019:  Bigham's One-Hour Heating and Air Conditioning installed a new central air and furnace system in 2015, and did a great job.  In September 2019, during the annual central air Home Protection Club (HPC) visit, I mentioned that my central air seemed to be struggling to keep my house cool.  The Bigham's tech found that I was a full pound low on R-410A refrigerant; installing more refrigerant lowered the plenum temperature by a full 10 degrees, and now my central air has no problem keeping my house cool.

The bad news was that the Bigham's tech advised that he would have to charge me $378 for the refrigerant.  What?  Almost $400 for just one pound of refrigerant?  On a four-year old system?  But, I authorized the charge.

I then followed up with Bigham's One-Hour Heating and Air Conditioning;  Why wasn't this handled as a warranty repair, at no additional cost?  My central air came with a 10-year warranty, after all.

Bigham's reviewed my query, and advised that this should have been a no-additional-charge warranty repair.  A refund will be processed.

So, kudos again to Bigham's One-Hour Heating and Air Conditioning.  They rectified the problem.  Well done to Kathleen (Kat) Gillett and Chris Gentry of Bigham's.  This is one reason why Bigham's is Diamond Certified.<//text>< Pics>

< Review>
I was very pleased with Mark's visit. He explained many things about my heating system (about 5 yrs. old) and made some recommendations to improve a more efficient heat delivery to the rooms of my home as well as providing a longer life to the system. I appreciated all this information very highly. Mark was easy to talk to and to learn from . He arranged for Tyler to come out tomorrow to give me a rundown on what can be done to accomplish this improvement to my heating system and the cost and time involved.   All and all, it was a very important visit, handled very well by Mark. He is a good person with much needed information to give to me regarding the upkeep, longevity, and efficiency of my heating system.</Review>

<Review>I can only say that Jeff G. did the most outstanding service call of anyone I have ever had come to my home for any reason.  He is very knowledgeable (i understood everything he was telling me about my heating system and AC).  He is professional in every way.
I was thinking of cancelling my contract with One Hour but after his visit I will not be doing that and I will tell my friends what wonderful service I received from him.
One Hour Heating and Air Conditioning is very fortunate to have such a man on their team.</Review><Time>1403899035980<//Time>< Name>

<userid>113558359869237514672</userid><name>Richard Suen< /name><Text>Jimmy T. came out to do an inspection on my furnace.

He was very professional, explaining how all of the components work and how to take care of my furnace to make it last longer.

He gave me two specific tips on how to clean the filter and grill.

I would highly recommend him. He knows his stuff and doesn't try to sell you services you don't need.

In a word... Reputable.< /Text><Date>1401843737660</Date><rating>5<//rating>< gmapID>

Bill Sage was very thorough & let us know what was going on so that we could make choices w/out trying to  upsell.<//Review>
</record></dataset><record>
<Text>Excellence from beginning to end!  Jake, who came to check the old furnace was clear, polite and knew what he was doing.  He assured us that the team that came to put in the new furnace would be excellent.  And they were.
David G. was terrific at every turn.  Various unexpected things came up and he solved each problem with real smarts and know how.  I could not have imagined a better person to install this furnace. The man with him, Jesse, was fine also.
I give as many stars as you have to these professional men who have given us peace of mind and a good system as we go into a rather unpredictable winter.< /Text>< username>

<review>Contract to replace the heater. I was suggested if I replace both heater and air conditioning units, will get $3000 rebate.
Works are done 4 years ago , but rebate money is never paid. To request 3 times. The answer is: “your house is not qualified for rebate” (!) That issue should be concerned before contract sign. This is the bate in advertising. Beware of it.< /review><Pictures>None</Pictures><Resp>None<//Resp><gmap_id>0x80844819c6420137:0xf48323f853f6380f<//gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>Edgar and David W installed a new furnace, air conditioner and return for us on Thursday, and I was extremely pleased with their professionalism, work ethic (they arrived at 9:30 am and worked straight through until 9 pm when they completed the jobs!), politeness and general helpfulness. They both went above and beyond to make the experience of this installation as seamless and positive as possible. WE were especially appreciative of some of the extra things they did. For example, when installing the new return, David noticed a leak caused by a worn gasket in the roof and fixed that, and went on to check the rest of the roof and installed new gaskets in several places, and then painted them so they would blend in with the roof. Thus fixing a problem we didn't realize we had, and one that could easily have caused us major headaches down the line. Edgar checked in with me several times to see if I had any questions about what they were doing and took great pains to make sure I understood exactly what was going on. I would highly recommend both of these men without reservation! They were a pleasure to have in my home and seemed incredibly competent and careful. The house was as clean after they left as it had been when they arrived. All in all a very positive experience.<//Text>< Pics>

Just wanted to let you know that David Galvez and his helper(don't remember his name) were fantastic. They installed a new Heater unit in the attic of my elderly mothers house and were very patient and explained everything to her. David was always willing to explain things as they went so we understood the process. They were clean and respectful of my moms house and dog. A great experience!< /Text>

Had questions about furnace light, etc., and the technician was more than helpful.   He should be the PR guy for One Hour Heating & Air Conditioning.  I would not hesitate in recommending Mike Pagliuca for any job you send him on.   Great character and honesty was a plus  -  One Hour Heating & Air Conditioning was certainly well represented by him.<//Review>

Mark R from One Hour Heating did a yearly service on my forced air furnace. He was very knowledgeable, pleasant and answered all my questions thoroughly. He gave me an education on modern heating furnaces.I enjoyed doing business and talking with him. I'd be glad to have him do the service next year. Thank you Mark.<//Review>

Many thanks to Mark Ross for his professional and knowledgable abilities in servicing my heating system. I appreciated his patient explanation of how things work; he made it very easy for me to understand. Mark made this service appointment a pleasant experience rather than a chore to endure. Thank you Mark for being so gracious.</review>

<text>Horrible customer service. Waited near three weeks for the owner to call me back. Finally told them i was going elsewhere from now on and to cancel their membership services because I'm tired of waiting. Couple minutes later the owner finally called me back.

Best part, wrong a.c. unit was installed in the house to begin with. My house doesn't get cold like it should. Waited 2 weeks for their senior tech, low and behold a.c. unit installed was too small for the house. Even one of their own techs that quit, and went to a different company didn't have anything good to say about one hour!

Edgar and Cookie (Matt) of One Hour Heating and Air Conditioning were awesome. On time, incredibly professional, courteous and knowledgable. Worked through lunch. Did an amazing job on the instillation and explained all the components of my new heating and A/C unit. I would highly recommend them, great guys and outstanding work.</text>

Well done for Jimmy T, knowledgeable and well experienced. He showed me how to install new filter the proper way....installing new  filter that will increase and improve more air  flow than we used to have. We highly recommended him to our neighbors , family and friends. Thank you Jimmy for a job well done. Next time we will try to get the HVAC Smart Chip.     From  Henry and Vida DelRosario<//review>

The review of my system was incredibly thorough, the work appears to have been done well (I have yet to get the final clearance) and the workers were polite and responsive. my only complaint was the mess left in the attic...it was messy before and while they replaced the ducts there was still a mess left which just seems a safety issue<//Text>

I recently had to have my HVAC ductwork replaced to increase the efficiency of my units.  One hour had recommended the work and di the installation work.  The workers were great and they completed it all in one day.  My only suggestion for this type of work is to get more than one estimate.  One Hour is pricy, but the system seems to be working better so far.< /Text>

William was surprised that issues left from a plumbing job, completed over a month ago, had not been resolved. I had called twice and registered my complaint but was not contacted. William contacted a manager and an appointment was made to resolve the issues. He was very clear in his explanation of my furnace problems.< /review>
