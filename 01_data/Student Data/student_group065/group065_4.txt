Such a safe haven in this confusing time!!! I cannot speak highly enough of this practice. Everyone in the office is incredibly kind and competent. The Covid precautions were impeccable… I felt completely safe. Above all, I felt I got truly professional dental care. Well other dentists wanted me to do invasive and expensive procedures, Dr. Granath’s assessment was simple and straightforward. I have never received such professional dental assistance. I am so grateful!!!</Review>

Very professional, clean setting. The new green office was very comfortable. Dr. Granath Oloph was very Tentative to his approach. He was very specific on asking about my breif medical history, this was no ordinary doctor's visit where the Doc comes in for 2 min and then starts prescribing all kinds of medication. Dr. Granath was very methodical in his approach to find out the best solution for my teeth. His assistant was awesome as well, she knew exactly what she was doing very informative. Also the front office people are so kind and they actually are concerned about your health. Thank you to  Dr. Granath and your awesome team.<//text>

Dr. Granath gave me the most thorough exam I’ve ever had as a new patient. The previous biological dentist I went to 4 years ago told me I needed several fillings replaced, he wanted me to have my wisdom teeth (that never came in) removed, and insisted on a multi-appointment process for basic cleaning. After my first cleaning, I did not return due to my difficult life situation and lack of finances. And I truly felt like he was not being honest, but was simply trying to see how much money he could get out of me. Dr. Granath, however, after examining my mouth, told me that all my current fillings looked fine, did not recommend removing my wisdom teeth, and said that all I need is one basic cleaning to remove tartar build-up.  Okay... WOW... that’s a completely different opinion! He was very nice, sincerely honest, very knowledgeable about Celiac Disease (which is one reason I chose him), spent considerable time with me, and was not trying to get me to have a bunch of work I didn’t need. I’m so happy I decided to check him out and I would highly recommend him to anyone seeking a caring, compassionate dentist who uses the safest and least toxic materials possible.</Review>

<review>The office staff is always pleasant and accommodating.  Dr. Granath did some major work for me a few years ago and the experience was much better than anticipated.  I continue to appreciate his thorough and natural approach.  This visit was for an exam and he was able to also fill a small cavity without anesthesia... and no discomfort.  They offer a friendly environment for those who are sensitive to scents, and provide comfort items such as pillows and blankets and homeopathic traumeel. But of course the most important aspect is the high quality of the dental procedures. I highly recommend this practice.< /review>< Pictures>

I thank God for Dr. Granath, Michelle, and the staff.  I had Mercury toxicity and had 11 amalgams removed without pain, quickly and safely, in 4 sessions.  Dr. Granath does excellent work for a reasonable price and his office atmosphere is green and very pleasant.  I am so very grateful for all the reassurance needed along the way! ;  My mind is clearer and I look forward to all the longterm benefits to come.</review>

My bite feels better than it has in more than 20 years. I came to Dr. Granath at the recommendation of two friends who are also patients. It's a long drive for me, but it's worth it after many years of avoiding dentists due to previous experiences.<//Text>

<Text>I can say that, unlike so many, I actually ENJOY going to see my dentist, Dr. Granath and his delightful staff.  It's family and the office is impeccably green, clean, light & utilizes the most advanced equipment & practices. It's stocked with informative books about holistic aspects of dentistry. The holistic or "biological"understanding of dentistry runs much deeper in Sweden, where he received his training, than in the dental community here in the U.S. I highly recommend this practice. He also discounts his fees 15% for seniors.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

I had put off for many years the removal of my amalgam fillings due to my sensitivities to injectable numbing agents and the preservatives used.I finally took the plunge and had all the old fillings removed and replaced with bio compatible materials.
My experience was a 10 plus.Dr Granath respected my nervousness and made everything so comfortable.He special ordered a preservative free product I tolerated completely while gently getting the job done over two visits.
I agree with the physician who referred me that Dr Granath is in a class of his own.</Text>

<text>Highly skilled biological dentist and staff. If you don't know what a biological dentist is, google it :)
Everyone is very friendly and capable. All the most modern equipment as well as homeopathic treatment options. Has a copy of Wheat Belly in the waiting room.< /text><rate>5</rate>< userid>

Dr. Granath, my dentist, Eileen, my hygienist, and all the staff are professional, do excellent work, and are caring human beings.  Like many people, going to the dentist is not my favorite activity.  They make it a fine environment and experience.  I recommend them without reservation.< /Text>

excellent and I was  well taken care of on every level:  no unneeded procedures, great precision and thorough dental work with my care and kindness, dental assistance and the office is up to date on all of the best technology, invasive procedures cut to a minimum, office is beautiful and relaxing, dental cleaning is excellent, thorough, and kind and a shout out to Connie whose competence in scheduling and compassion are off the charts.  a big hearty thank you to Dr. Granath for assembling such a team.< /Review>

I've been going to see Dr. Granath for years. He and his staff are the best: professional, friendly, courteous, and smart.  The best.

< review>
I moved to New York a few years ago and still go back to Dr. Granath for checkups and any serious dental work that may arise. Why? Because he and his staff are not only extremely competent but also amazingly caring. Every holistic health precaution possible is taken in this office. Dr. Granath and his staff frequently expand their knowledge of the latest techniques and technology available and implement them. Dr. Granath's thorough and sensitive approach to the mouth that is connected to the whole person is rare, appreciated and hard to find on any coast. ...worth the airfare - busfare, trainfare, whatever it takes :)< /review>

My daughter has been coming here since she was a newborn. We drive an hour for this office. I have always had a great experience and visit.
Things are different with the pandemic and they have a very nice system for getting patients in.
The front office staff has always been friendly to us and very helpful.
The nurses always explain what’s going on and take the time for small conversation.
Dr Dubey has always been so gentle with my baby and actually takes the time to make sure that the parent is also okay she explains everything in detail and addresses all my concerns. She always makes sure I feel comfortable with our visit and I appreciate how she makes sure that I have no worries before we head out. I also love that we know what to expect at our next visit because Dr Dubey tells us what’s next. I’m very confident in the care they provide for my daughter and highly recommend this office.<//text>

Professional staff, clean facility, adheres to all current Covid safety precautions and a tremendous step up compared to Valley Oak Pediatrics. My family and I love this place and the respectful and courteous staff. Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a pediatrician office.< /text>

<text>I've been taking my 3 1/2 yo son since he was 2 months old. Dr Dubey listened to my concern when my son was just 2 months old and she has remained attentive and caring ever since. To this day she shows she cares about my son as a whole not just on reason for our visit. I recommend her to anyone! And her staff is nice as well.< /text>< pics>

Horrible experience at this place! Took my son to his first check up and she refused to give me any medical service all because I said I wanted to do some research on vaccines before he gets them. But because I didn't get him vaccinated today, no joke, today! She threatened to refuse me from her practice. And had me sign a paper stating I denied him vaccines. Is that crazy or what? It's not like I didn't want to get him vaccinated! I am aware of all the dangerous diseases out there!
This MD doctor only cares about how much money she will get, rather than caring for patients!</Text>

Dr. Dubey is the best! She answers all my questions with great depth and is willing to walk me through concepts I don’t understand. My 2 year old sees her as a friend that cares deeply for her wellness and development. I highly recommend All For Kids clinic! They are accommodating, clean, organized, and very friendly.<//Text>

I made All for Kids my sons primary drs office he is almost 2yrs old, and we had our very first visit on the 14th of September and it was wonderful. The place is very clean and kid friendly, cartoons were on in both the lobby and patient room. The receptionist was polite and the Dr. Was great with my son, answered all my questions with more than a brief statement and act gave me knowledge about what I had questions on. I appreciate the care of this whole place!< /Review>

It’s always clean they are always nice, definitely try and help and provide good service. But I do wish they would listen to parents more on things, such as milestones, behaviors, weight in kids. It’s more a oh yeah it’s okay and than move on.<//text>

<review>I truly have nothing bad to say about Dr Dubey, she is very sweet, and truly loves her job. I feel like every parent wants a caring Doctor for their child and someone that loves their job.She will make sure to make time for any questions and concerns you have, and accommodates to what the parent is most comfortable with. I reccomend her to any parent who wants a caring Pediatrician. Also anyone you meet or speak to at the front desk are all so sweet, and the nurses that work at the office are all so nice to my little one. I have had nothing but good experiences everytime I've gone.<//review><Rate>5<//Rate>< Resp>

This office is very professional and very helpful. My kids have seen about 5 different pediatricians prior to Dr. Dubey and each time it was a headache trying to get through to doctors and the front desk girls were always rude the MA’s were always clueless it was a nightmare trying to find a good Dr’s office for my children, I came across Dr.Dubey about 4/5 years ago and I found everything I needed and more! These people sincerely care about your child’s needs. The girls at the front are super sweet, the MA’s are super professional and helpful. As for Dr.Dubey she LISTENS to my concerns she genuinely cares and she explains everything so that I understand. She is not condescending like other doctors expecting us to know medical terminology.. she offers great advice and support to all her patients! Thank u for all that the team continues to do to keep our children healthy !</Text>

Dr Dubey is the most educated pediatrician we have ever had. She is on the cutting edge of all the medical issues. I have never trusted a doctor more than Dr Dubey with my children. She has been accurate every single time.
We appreciate her and her staff and value her opinion always. We highly recommend all for kids and Dr Dubey!!< /text>

< Review>
I was so disappointed today with this clinic. I been bringing my kids there for a while and today i met a new receptionist named Cinthya Vaquel. She was rude and not helpful at all. She refused to let my kids to see the doctor for a non-reasonable excuse. I felt like she just wanted to win the conversation and not trying to help. It is such a shamed now if this place gives this kinda of service with this staff.</Review>

As a first-time mother, I can honestly say that I do not know how I would have navigated my way through the first two years without Dr. Dubey and her wonderful staff. Dr. Dubey would go out of her to contact me after hours regarding questions/concerns that I had earlier in the day.< /Review>< gmap_id>

We are blessed to have found Dr Dubey as a pediatrician. Couldn’t be more satisfied. We just moved to the area 6 months ago and my kids love her. She made my pre-teen feel safe and comfortable around her. She always strives to give 10-10. Thank you for being an excellent pediatric.</Review>

<Review>I absolutely love Dr.Dubey and her office. My son is a year and has been to Dubey since his 3 month check up. His first check up was at a terribly crowded, hot, and unpleasant dr office and that’s when I decided to switch him to Dr. Dubey. That was the best decision. She is very caring, patient, and always takes your concerns serious. I also switched my 10 year old over to her office and she has helped with diagnosing him and referring him to a specialist. She has responded to every message within the same day that I sent them. She is extremely knowledgeable and I trust her judgement and calls on issues. The office itself is very clean and rarely crowded. I almost never have a wait and I am always able to get an appointment in reasonable time. I don’t know why some people say they don’t answer the phone. Only time I have an issue with that is first thing in the morning. I assume they are still getting their day organized and started so I usually just wait until after 9 to call and they always answer. I can’t say enough good things and I’m so thankful that Dr. Dubey accepts our insurance!< /Review>< pics>

<review>I had good things to say until my girl called them about medication.

My girl calls to get a different prescription for my son, cuz they prescribed an anti biotic that was to strong for him making him cry all night. They had prescribed the z Pac(?) And another anti biotic that was white in color that was to strong.

This dam office tried saying I Told them that my son was taking the z Pac(?) When I never did and they tried saying how it's my fault my son got the wrong medication and told my girl that we needed to better communicate to avoid this in the future!

Not cool people...< /review>< rate>

<Review>Dr. Dubey and her staff are wonderful. My son was uncomfortable the first time walking in her office because it looking like she only had infants as her patients because of the cartoons and deco but when we met her ,she made him feel comfortable during our first visit. I'd refer her to anybody that needs a pediatrician cuz she's great. Thank u Dr. Dubey< /Review>< Pictures>

They never seem to have decent prices on shoes. I go in to get comfortable shoes and they are $60-$80 when I can buy the same pair at Walmart for $20. They don't have a big variety of shoes for kids. Needed to get sandals and they had only like 3 pairs in one size that I needed. It's never really organized right<//Review>

We brought our son for a pair of shoes and asked for him to be measured. She (Bree) acted put out but did it and told us he's between a 9.5 and 10. Ok! We find a pair of shoes, he tries them on, likes them and so we buy them. Next day I start thinking that 10 seems big for an 11 year old's foot and take a closer look. They're a good 2" too large so tonight we go to exchange and it's Bree again who proceeds to tell me that she can measure again but "why bother because each shoe fits differently and didn't he try them on before we bought them?" Oh no little girl... it was your JOB to measure his foot. My issue is taking my son's 11 year old word that they fit but why wouldn't I when he'd just been measured 10 minutes before! I do not appreciate Bree's attitude and lack of consideration. Never once did she apologize or offer to help him find a replacement. Her "whatever" attitude is NOT conducive for customer service and we all never go back.</text>

Good service, but it appears the rep measured my son's foot wrong, so recent purchase doesn't fit, and I have to go back again.  Did have a good sale.  Get any 3, items, get be 1/3 off the bill (before taxes).</Review>

Going out of business probably for their outrages "low cost" shoes even with there new discounts due to that they still dont beat walmart for the same or same quality shoes! I'm talking a difference between 5-15 to 25-45!< /text>

<UserId.>116307803699061696771<//UserId.><rate>5<//rate><review>I've floated this river countless times and love it more every single time. If you plan to float just be aware that at times the flow can be fairly swift and will require some effort to stay out of the bush but it's well worth it. The fishing is also amazing. You can catch all sorts of rainbow and brown trout if you find the right spot. If you're looking to see the real beauty of the Owens Valley then you should definitely stop by the Owens River.< /review><response>None< /response></record></dataset><record>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>New rules on the catch 5 fish total for your trip. Not 5 fish per day. Five fish period. The water was really low and the weeds really high. Trash was a huge issue. No one cleaning up. Not worth your time or money as it is expensive to stay and eat in Bishop. Thumbs down....< /review>< pics>

They have added a huge cardio area and expanded the functionality of the whole gym.  Also, has a nice lap pool and provide swim lessons to know kids in the summer.  Great staff.</Review>

Great facility, friendly staff. Clean locker rooms. Cannot beat the gorgeous track outside to run on, with some shady spots from trees, nice landscaping, ocean views... classes Mon-Fri 1130-1230. Joclyns yoga class Tues at 1130 is great.</Text>

The best naval base gym I have ever been to. Never very busy and a lot of different spaces to workout in depending on what you want to do. Offers massages and even has a hot tub!<//review>

<text>It is a great place to work out. There is a variety of machine and free weights, a basketball court, exercise room and the usual cardio machines.  I like that I can bring a guest for $5.  It's really crowded in the evening between 6 and 8 pm.< /text><pics>None</pics><response>None</response>< Gmap_id>

I got three different flavors that all came in packs of 3.  So the rating is consistent with all three versions.  They all had a crumbly texture...one that basically disintegrates in your mouth as it soaks up your saliva.  The flavors were fairly subtle so while you can taste the distinct flavor of each flavor it wasn’t much of an impact.<//Text>< rate>

<Text>It is very difficult for a cookie to impress me but this one did. I have not had cookies that have a similar taste profile where you can truly taste the browned butter and sea salt. It also has the right amount of crumbly and density, like shortbread but more airy. Highly recommend the original. The gluten free choc mint did not disappoint as well. It wasn't overly sweet and neither the chocolate nor the mint was overpowering, instead they complemented the base recipe well. Only wished we had gotten more. A little steep at $1.25 a cookie but you should definitely at least try it.<//Text>< pictures>

Been here a few times in the past, small pricy 🥠  cookies with different flavors. Will be nice when sampling is allowed again.</Text>

<review>These cookies are my favorite. They have never failed to disappoint me. Every single flavor is so amazing and the cookie delicate and delicious. Every single time I walk in, friendly, cheerful employees offer me a sample of their original brown butter cookie, or any cookie I would like to try before purchasing. This place is a must try!</review>< UserId.>

<review>It doesn’t taste very good, it doesn’t look good and it’s absolutely not wort the money. Cheap cookies from Target taste better. I didn’t get why it’s so overhyped<//review>< rate>

<Review>Delicious cookies. The seasonal spice flavor is the best. They currently have a covid friendly setup right now for purchasing out front where you order at a stand in the doorway of the store. You tell them what you want and they bag it up, then you pay with your card. Minimal to no contact.<//Review><Rating>5< /Rating></record>

Seriously the most delicious cookies! They offer you a sample when you walk in and if you didn't plan to walk out with anything, you will now. Incredibly friendly and cheerful staff. Worth every penny!< /Text>

These taste chalky and dry. I don’t taste the brown butter that is supposed to impart the subtle flavor it’s supposed to. I have gone in a couple times in Paso store, the women working there, hold their breath act unfriendly and stare you down. Last time I checked, it’s not a china shop or Cartier, just crummy overpriced cookies. Try at least to put a smile on your faces and act hospitable!</review>

< Review>
We came in because we were curious to taste the brown butter cookies. They are great! The look and consistency of the cookies remind me of Mexican cookies called polvorones. The brown butter in the cookies and the sea salt give the cookies a nice twist. I also tasted the coconut lime and almond which I both recommend. We bought a few bags of cookies to take home and share.</Review>

Best cookies I've ever had. Always stock up when I am in the area. It's great that they ship because I live in the Bay Area & they're down in Paso Robles. If you get a chance, go try these cookies, you'll be leaving with some.</review>

Why would you sell your best cookies ONLY on fridays at the Paso store!?!? Hate hate hate. These cookies are the best I’ve ever had but some of these business practices are goofy.< /review>

Quality services for the best prices around town.  You may have to leave your car all day but no worries because everything will be done perfect and good. They will always go above and beyond for their customers. Give them a try you won't be disappointed. I won't go anywhere else. P.s ask for BURT he's the best.< /Review>

Mechanics are top notch! Very knowledgeable! Customer service is beyond compare! I haven’t been anywhere else in 5 years so there may be someone cheaper but I trust these people way too much to go anywhere else.

I often see classic cars in the garage and they are always busy. I highly recommend you give them a shot.<//text>

As far as mechanics go, most really turn me off with poor transparency and a lack of seemingly standardized pricing. Elite auto manages to deal with these issues with extremely open customer service and an excellent pricing structure that is very competitive. Top that off with quick service and a willingness to go into great detail regarding the repairs, the pricing, etc, and you get an amazing shop that I would personally recommend with unwavering confidence. You should be able to tell for yourself just by calling them and discussing your issues over the phone.</review>

This place is by far the best auto shop you can go to. Brian is always so nice. They are super affordable and they always make sure to do quality work they should be rated 10 stars. I come here anytime somethings wrong with my car and they always do great work.</Review>

Window tint started bubbling 2 MONTHS after I got my car tinted. Dont waste your money here. The owner won't redo the tint. This is definitely a shady business</review>

I’ve been coming to Magnuson since 2007.. I have had tint installed on two Camry’s , Mitsubishi Montero Sport, Chrysler 300..., And today I’m installing an upgraded sound system on my 2019 Toyota Tacoma... never had a problem. My family and I don’t go anywhere else.</Text>

<name>Cheyenne Garcia</name><rating>1</rating><Text>This place is not worth your time or money. I got my windows done a little over a month ago and now there is little air pockets popping up. I have the warranty so i called to see what i can do and this grown man answers. I tell him about the air pockets and before i can finish my sentence he cuts me off and decides he wants to get loud telling me i need my receipt. Uh ok sir i have my receipt but after your tantrum i will be taking my business to an actual professional. They couldn't get it right the first time so why should i bother the second time especially when dealing with such rude shady people.<//Text><UserId.>101535525285218511460< /UserId.>< response>

The owner does not honor the “ lifetime warranty “ they were very unprofessional when I tried to get the bubbled tint redone. This place might be cheap but the work is not good and the shop does not stand by its lifetime warranty.<//review>< pics>

<review>This place has great deals, and the staff are nice, the tint came out perfectly they did tell me not to roll down my windows for 2 days which is fine for me, I also know that you should not take it to a car wash until after 24hrs, all in all great service I recommend this place to all.

These dudes right here know their stuff about cars for sure. They have the best deals for tint, audio, glass, and custom work hands down. I was there while they were customizing a sound system on a Chevy lowrider & I was very impressed with their work and style. specially on how they worked to please that customer. Just great vibes when you meet the owner and it's staff. Lancelot is the man if you want to get a great deal and guaranteed work on your vehicle. I highly recommend this place.</Text>

Great Experience Overall!  You might not know this from their website but they will fix or replace your door window motor.  Our passenger window fell down into the door.  We called our mechanic and asked for an estimate and he quoted us a much higher price.  I called Magnuson and they gave us a much better price and the service was quick and efficient.  The passenger window now works great.< /review>

I spoke with the  Manager who said a few months ago if I'm not able to find my receipt that shows a had lifetime warranty to come back and he will give me a discount to redo the work for all of my front windows are peeling. After a couple months and failed to be able to find my receipt I called to schedule and to check on the price with the discount the receptionist who handled the call refuse to even acknowlege the possibility of giving me a discount and said that either they give the current coupon value and that's all that they could give which I found to be acceptable for this is because I am bringing back a vehicle that did not hold up on quality of work to get there not willing to stand by it the woman was very rude not sure she's related to the business owner but if she is not related to the business owner she really represented them horribly as an employee do not go here horrible service< /Review>< pics>

I also got a subwoofer installed and better speakers , was pleased with the set up very clean, and has fuses. My speakers did blow out within the first week but they gave me no trouble replacing those with better speakers all under warranty. I loved the lifetime warranty for there suntek tints and the fact that the Audio system has a warranty is great, it is a year. Also front tinting on lights have 5 year warranty. Got the back taillights redone under warranty because rain damage. Honored my warranties with no problem. I had my suspicions but they really came through we’re i needed them too. Will update review after seeing how the new speakers are. But so far pleased with the customer service.</review><user_id>116592620931384598442</user_id><username>justin zarate< /username></record>

I haven' got much done on my car for a few years but recently had to take my window tints off and took my car to Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass. These guys are awesome.  My friend was waiting for me because other places I called told me it would take 2-3 hours to take off so I assumed it would been the same here but nope! My tints were off real quick.<//text>

My friend suggested Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass to get a window tint and we came in to get an estimate of how much it would cost for me to get my windows re-tinted. Had an appointment today at 12:00pm. Got the 18% carbon tint on all five windows plus had to remove the old tint. Mr Lancelot Juarez did a great job and he has good customer service as well.< /text>

I had auto glass tinting 3 weeks ago. I made an appointment about a week earlier and chose the type of tint we would use. I took my car to their shop and left to have some business done. 2 hours later Mr Juarez called me to say the car is ready. Window tinting was care-free and I am happy with the end result.< /review>

I've had a lot of experience with broken windows, I've gone to many different auto glass repair shops. After a car collision the car needed the windshield replaced. After calling insurance, they recommended me to Magnuson Window Tinting & Auto Glass and I scheduled an appointment. They did an excellent job cleaning and did the auto glass installation all in an hour while I grabbed lunch down the street.< /Text>

It was horrible guy asked me to leave my car over night because he was going to get started on it. So I did because I didn't go to work till the afternoon he said he would call me to give me a status update and he didn't. That regardless my car would b ready before 10am. When it was time for me to go to work I stopped by and they were barely getting started on my car and that was 2:30pm .....I was so mad I even lost time of work and when my car was finally ready he had the nerve to say he don't have to give me a discount but he was anyways...well now theirs bubbles on my windows when I rolled down my windows their was glue inside my door panels that rubbed on my windows it was hard to take off.. and on top of it all they left a mess in my car Lil pieces of tint all over. I'm no happy at all I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!  They did a sloppy ass job. Should of went to LA for the prize I paid lol< /Review>

Went in there they tinted my Windows and there was still bubbles weeks later so I went back and they re did them yet again there is still bubbles. Expensive yet their work doesnt speak for the price. Steer clear.</Text>

Nice place for Portuguese food. Loved this place from the first taste. There was fast and courteous service. This place has a nice feel to it. Feeling here is similar to a cafe in San Jose I liked.</text>

Portuguese food and the atmosphere here is above par. Staff is always timely even when they have a full house. The service was sociable and attentive. The bill won't shock you. Food is like a restaurant in Jacksonville I liked.</review>

All the good reviews must be from people who work here or have some type of tastebud malfunction. The food is terrible and the employees are rude and makes you feel uncomfortable. Won’t be waisting my money here ever again<//text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I give 3 stars. It was a Sunday, the busy lady did not want anyone to help her. And she was slow because she was alone. But the food is very rich, I recommend it

Everything about this place was fine clean lots of selection you could tell the ingredients were all fresh as well. I did not try anything myself this time but we did get a walnut ice cream that was pretty good. I also posted pictures of the menu for all the people that like all the other treats.< /review>

<time>1553990677812<//time><Text>I had a Mango respado and it was delicious.  My wife and I shared a Tuna Torta.  We also had a canteloupe aguas frescas.  It was all very delicious and a reasonable price too.  The area that it's in is kind of neat to check out too, it's part of old Town Romoland next to the Old Mottes Farm, where they have an antique car museum there now.  Also the China bistro nearby looks delicious as well.  One piece of feedback though if the owner is reading these reviews , the torta had what tasted like White American cheese in it, which I am really not a fan of.  I think provolone or Swiss would be much yummier, or maybe having the option for either.  Otherwise, we loved it and would come back again.</Text><gmapID>0x80db61da82dea145:0x1d43263b7c7374c1< /gmapID></record>

<text>I love this place! Super reasonable prices, the create your own smoothie is bomb! Highly recommend, I've only been here twice since under new management and it has been a good experience both times. If you love smoothies definitely try them out. Also I'm addicted to the veggie wrap!<//text>< userid>

I love the Freshness of their products and how healthy everything is. You will not be disappointed! I was waiting for a place like this for a long time!!

< review>
Small family owned shop with hearty, healthy mostly fruit based snacks. It is Spanish themed but all cultures will find something delicious. Just ask the staff and they'll help you pick something and customize it for you. Our family has tried yummy cheese sauce loaded nachos, smoothie and agua frescas (made to order), Bionicos (chopped fruit, cream and granolla) corn on the cob, veggie wrap (lots of lettuce and hummus) coconut shave ice and their home made fruit popsicles. Everything was fresh and really tasty. The young man and lady working there had great customer service. We highly reccomend it especially on a hot day.</review>

I love their Pico de Gallo, which has delicious mango, watermelon, cucumber and jicama then they add salt, lime and chili powder to taste. They have a variety of fruit combinations and juices but the Pico de Gallo is a fresh, mouth watering  combination that keeps me coming back for more:) I definitely recommend Nutrifruit.<//Text>

Favorite buffet now. Actually, the ONLY buffet we frequent now. Their hot and sour soup is unbeatable, and you can add vinegar and green onion, to taste. I am so happy with that option. Honestly, I come here for the soup, but the variety of seafood and other meats is excellent and I always leave way too stuffed. But satisfied. 😋 They also have a hibachi grill. Wish the sushi was better though, but even that doesn't take away a star.</review>

One family of six, swarmed the crab legs as soon as they came out. Multiple times. Leaving nothing for anyone else. Wow, just wow.

Dinner here was good. I enjoyed almost everything Golden Koi had to offer. Most of the food was full of flavor and not watered down. There’s sushi, Mongolian BBQ, Korean BBQ, various Chinese dishes and then a pizza, huh? Nothing stood out as horrible so that’s a good sign.

The staff is very friendly and attentive. They do work hard to keep this place clean.

It is a bit messy at certain stations but you can blame that on your fellow patrons.

I’d eat here again.</text><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

<Review>Golden Koi did a great job of accommodating protocols during Covid. Everyone had to wear gloves when serving themselves.  I normally do not like going to buffets because the thought of people eating and kicking their fingers and going back for seconds and touching the serving spoon with locked fingers is a disgusting thought.  But because everyone had to use gloves to serve themselves,  this thought was diminished. The food was good and being a seafood eater, there were plenty of selections to choose from. I think the dessert table could have had more variety but I cant complain about the main dishes. I ate on a weekend and I'm not sure if the menu is the same for weekdays but I was definitely pleased with the selection. I would have given it 5 stars since they weren't lacking, but like I said I'm not an avid buffet goer so 4 is the most I would give for any buffet. Definitely worth the drive to head out to roseville. Wish they had one like this in Elk Grove.< /Review>< userid>

<Review>I’m surprised it is rated poorly by some! The workers are always friendly, the food is tasty, what more can you ask for? I took mine to go, as it was Saturday night and the place was at capacity with an hour wait. People know they are back open and are there in droves. When retrieving food, you have to wear plastic gloves. Overall I would recommend!< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>Went with 2 adults and 2 children but my 12 year old was considered an adult. Paid $90 dollars and couldn't even eat the crab it literally tasted like plastic or rubber!!! Even the feeling of the crab meat felt plastic. Never going again. Do not recommend.<//Review>< pics>

Very happy this place has stepped up their game from the past. Very good food and varieties! A little pricey but all you can eat people! There are no other places around like this.< /Review>

<Review>UPDATE!  The Koi Buffet is now open again! It's all the same great food as before. I just can't see the negative reviews here, cause service is great and the place is clean. The food is all fresh if you get here at a reasonable time. Best time is when they open! Fresh food and nobody has picked over all the food yet!  I gotta go back for those wings and ribs!

Closed for now due to the virus thing, but I really can't wait till it opens again! This is the best buffet in the area for a reasonable price. It's under new management so it cleaner than before and the service is perfect. The food is a generous selection of Chinese foods that you don't normally see at most buffets.

What I really like are the fried chicken wings and the ribs! Yeah Chinese do the best Chicken and Ribs! They even have french fries here, just in case you don't want Chinese food. I've always found the food hot and fresh, but do go 1/2 hr before closing and expect all fresh food just for you, it won't happen. Go at opening 11am! I want this place to open again!<//Review>< date>

My favorite was the coconut shrimp and cooked green beans. I think they are over priced but still had a good meal.<//Review>

<Text>Used to love coming here, food was great and price was fair. And just like any other Chinese place quality of food kept going down and price kept climbing up. Crab legs were soft and mushy. It’s still ok buffet but definitely not worth the $18.99 dinner price. Very disappointed 🙁<//Text><Pics>None</Pics>< resp>

We were so excited to try this place since it was the first buffet we'd been to since the lockdown.  Unfortunately was disappointed greatly.  I was most excited for the crab legs but there was none. The container was empty except for a couple little broken pieces.  Super sad since that was the main reason for going. My stomach was not feeling very well afterwards either.</text>

<Response>None< /Response><text>Went for the second time the other day I mainly go to buffets for the crab legs lol but I was a bit disappointed AGAIN because the snow crab legs seemed a bit old and had no flavor like they've been sitting in plain water all day.. my advice would be just STEAM the crab legs to warm them not soak them.. I Will go back and try again for a third time but if things haven't improved I will lower my rating because I am a crab Critic lol. I'll update y'all I believe in 3 chances after that you're canceled if no improvement 😒</text><UserId.>107902888990665554790<//UserId.>< Pictures>

Food was good. Steady stream of customers for the lunch crowd. Temperatures taken when entering. Everyone wears a mask when not eating, hand sanitizer and disposable gloves worn while getting your food. We'll go again.< /Review>

Cons: When getting food, people don't social distance but everyone has masks and gloves on unless seated.

Otherwise, I loved it. Oysters weren't great but the Cocktail Shrimp made it a great date.</Review>

Have not been here for a year. So glad I came. Though it is more expensive now, the food and cleanliness was EXCELLENT! The food was very fresh and there were new selections. Glad I came early as it got crowded at lunch time.<//text>

<Review>Pretty happy decision to eat there. Looked at the food before deciding and about 8/10 things looked pretty fresh. This was on a Thursday evening so maybe not the most busy time. At least not very busy when we were there. I imagine weekends to be busier.

This place is pretty big. Could seat many people if needed. Food was good and I think it's cool they have soft serve and regular ice cream.

Mostly pretty typical Asian buffet stuff with a few surprises. The Mei Fun was nice! Thin little rice noodles with a simple and warm flavor.

I might come back if I'm in the area and looking for a buffet again. Sushi wasn't great here but most non sushi buffets that offer it generally meet a low expectation for that.

Solid 4 stars. Service was friendly too! Maybe even more so than most buffets. I'll give them credit there.

5 stars if the sushi were better and more of the food items were fresh. But the price is quite good for what you're getting.

Maybe it's tough for buffets to compete at this price range though because Thunder Valley does a buffet that is bigger and about the same price for dinner on weekdays. Between the two, I'd have to give it to thunder but for the sake of variety I'd probably come here from time to time if I frequented this area a lot more.< /Review>< Pics>

<Rate>4</Rate><Text>There's a good variety of foods and the restaurant is clean.  The buffet area, dining area and bathroom are clean, and that's each of the handfull of times I've been there. I appreciate that during this Covid time, they are requesting guests sanitize their hands and then put on one-time use disposal gloves each time they go get a new plate of food. The sanitizer and gloves are provided. It's a reasonably priced buffet that offers Chinese food and then some American foods for the pickier eaters (which include a small variety of french fries, cheese pizza, fried chicken, mac n cheese, etc.). They also have good customer service.< /Text>< pics>

Cleaning maintenance in the bathrooms and throughout restaurant floors needs to be more thorough and constantly maintained especially during these "covid-19" pandemic days.< /Text>

<Review>This restaurant use to be excellent.
But now the food was not that good. The food was barely warm, over fried and dry.
However, our service was great.< /Review>< user>

Celebrated our 22nd Anniversarry excited our  favorite buffet was open. We had to dine outside which was okay on a warm day. Food was dry, cold, and limited with no sushi, Mongolian, fresh fruit, or ice cream. They did have many protocols to stay safe with covid to include wearing gloves and mask and eating outside.We loved this place before covid and hope they can make it thru these tough times,but sadly not worth high price with half the buffet options available 😢<//Review>

Just your typical Asian buffet. They have seafood and regular Chinese food a dessert area fresh fruit area. They have a grill station but the cook kept burning everything. They had sushi which was okay. The main thing I disliked was that they used canned tuna in some sushi rolls< /review>

New ownership and food and bathrooms much much much better.  Overall really good.  My daughter and I only bothered to come in because we were driving by and saw the new ownership sign.  Glad we did.  We'll definitely be coming back.  Sushi was actually very good (and cold) for a Chinese buffet.  Mongolian stir fry and grilled shrimp were excellent.  Many other quality options as well in the Chinese buffet selection.  So happy to have a quality Chinese buffet again in the neighborhood!< /text>

Love coming to this to all you can eat buffet. Great food and best of all lots and lots of crabs to eat. I want to thank the manager Francis for his hospitality and care for his customers, he made sure I got the best crabs first after they ran out! Definitely recommend this place. Also very family friendly.</Review>

Crab was awful, Chinese doughnuts were stale and had hard spots, and in my opinion the worst crime is the vanilla diarrhea they call ice cream.

< Review>
This buffet has changed hands and let me tell you it's a lot better than the POS it use to be. The new ownership has some decent items to choose from and run this place decently compared to the former hyenas that ran this restaurant. I would give this place three and a half Stars. Not bad and for the price it's pretty decent.

My advice is to get in before the quality starts to go downhill. With places like this usually new ownership tries to do their best but when they start to realize they're losing money it all goes to hell.<//Review>

I don't think I can say anything good about this place...im not a person to usually complain about service but this place was bad. There was zero service for the 2 hours that we were there. To start it off they tried to seat us at a spot that had about a cup full of rice and noodles spilled all over the floor under the seats of one side of the table. We had to ask them to clean up our spot a few times until they actually did anything about it. We didn't get any drink refills(not even water) or plates cleaned off the table the whole time. By the time we were leaving we had plates piled up quite high andthere was little room for anything else on the table. The food was nothing special at all, so unless you are going to only eat crabs you might as well go somewhere else, cause that was the only food they had that was tasty.< /text>

The staff was very friendly and service was that of a fine restaurant. Plenty of food variety for pleasing children and adults, the only critical remarks I can say was that the dinner only signs were a bit confusing. I'm sure had I asked I could have cleared up that confusion. I can say the experience was overall pleasant and the restaurant was clean, well kept, and we'll managed. Thank you Koi.< /Review>< pictures>

The food was terribly stale and it would have been right to sue them for it.

The flavor was absent.

They charge extra for drinks and the food is large in quantity not quality.

Expect to waste your money by going here.<//Review>

First thing you see is a nasty fish tank. The place was also hot and humid. Some of the food tastes  old.  The floors were sticky.  The cups weren't cleaned.

This place could use some help. For now I'll rate them a 1 due to the simple fact that I see no changing in the near future. These are the kind of people who will get by with what they can.< /text>

Hands down favorite buffet in the area!! So delicious, nothing tastes like it's been sitting under the heat lamps forever like at other places. Great service, employees are super nice and helpful. Also, compared to other buffet place prices, this place is priced pretty cheap for the high quality of food you're getting. Absolutely love it, and higly recommend to everybody!< /text>

<Text>We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch there today. My husband & I are only visiting for a month from Fiji & we depart tomorrow.  Out of the 4 Asian buffets we visited here in California, I am highly recommending Golden Koi Buffet. The restaurant is clean, the varieties of food are so good & the customer service is superb. I ate alot of the mussels on the shell that was spicy & also loved the shrimps that were deep fried. The new manager, Francis, was so welcoming & checked every now & then to see if we were okay. The service boys, were quick to clear our used plates & were also quick to refill our drinks. Will definitely revisit Golden Koi when we are next here in California</Text>< username>

Good Chinese buffet with good selection.  Price has gone up some especially weekend nights.  Lunch is the best value.  Don't expect gourmet but look around there will be some good dishes.  If they are doing the Mongolian grill have that.  Don't judge this place on the nuggets and french fries that not what you come here for</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><Text>Place was ran down. Prices listed are not accurate. Customer service was very slow and was hard to understand wait staff and hostess. Steamed oysters were not fresh and tasted like sand and dirt. When I brought it to the hostess attention she went and yelled at wait staff in front of everyone for the slow service but, did nothing to help them or try to improve the evening. They are getting one star because my boyfriend was happy they had crab legs and they had a decent amount of meat in them. However, both of us had upset stomachs after even though didn't eat much and date night was kind of ruined.<//Text>< pictures>

Otherwise the food is good, if a bit predictable. if they had frog legs, pigeon or oysters like many of their competitors (especially on weekends or for dinner when they charge more $) I would give them 5 stars.<//Review><rate>4<//rate>< gmapID>

Crab Legs were a bit bland even with the butter.... I enjoyed to Mongolian bit though, kept going back for more... Servers are a bit rude and don't refill drinks often at all. Oddly enough I'd probably still be willing to go back.<//Text>

<review>Best seafood buffet around. Salt and pepper shrimp, coconut or Walnut shrimp, crab legs, lots of times they have called mussels too. And that's not even 1/3 of the fish selection! They also have decent sushi (although it's not the best) and a grill, plus all the stuff you would expect at a Chinese buffet. The only downside is that the floors can sometimes be slick. I one-time went in wearing a special boot from my doctor's office... Had never had any problem with it anywhere else but it just didn't have enough grip on the slightly slippery floor
I ended up leaving halfway through my meal because I was seriously afraid of falling.< /review>< pictures>

It's great for buffet, take out makes it less affordable since it's by the pound and you don't get sushi for the take out. But the sushi is very simple and there is a chef on standby to cook your food like a bbq style ! Quick service and nice ladies. Clean bathrooms!!!< /text>

<Text>It was okay there is a lot to choose from sushi bar crab legs Mongolia bbq type stir fry bar. But the melted butter for the crab legs tasted like plastic the crab was cold and wet like it sat in the pot it was cooked in all day.

We had celebration yesterday.
Costumer service must be improved!
Four our friends left , because of unprofessional customer service..
They included tips in to the bill..!
I can tip only if I see service. We didn’t see that..
Dirty place... do not go there...</text>

Buffets!!! What can I say, most buffets are the same but if you manage to go right when they open is the best time to go.

Small buffets dont have enough people coming in at open so they dont make enough food then you find yourself waiting for things.

Not here, at ooen at least be smart when you go to a buffet, Golden Kois good is great to taste, fair priced, and they're always stocked, bot running low like some other chinese buffets. Maybe that's why they're one of only a few left around here?

From best potstickers I ever had ( because it tasted like they were partially deep fried) to their deep fries shrimp what else can i ask for?

Trust me theres more, just go!!!</review>

Crab was awful, Chinese doughnuts were stale and had hard spots, and in my opinion the worst crime is the vanilla diarrhea they call ice cream.
Side note our waiter was actually creepy.< /text>

<Review>Great variety from sushi to sea food to stake and chicken. BUT... it needs more cleaning. The entrance has crumbs all over the floor, under the table floor was disgusting also. I had to tell the server to sweep the floor for us. The two ladies in the front had their own thing going instead of making their area look good. Your lobby is your presentation, right?. If that is right at front, Can you guys imagine how dirty is the back where we don't get to see?? Uhh goosebumps...<//Review>< pictures>

Actually, 2.5 stars. The interior deserves 3 stars. To me it seemed a bit dark. Some chair legs are a bit torn. The front desk lady seems doesn't care about being polite. The food ... the food didn't look fresh and tasty. Some of the sushi looked real old. The lunch is inexpensive. And that's plus.<//Review>

<Text>Food was good. But the area where the food is was so crowded. A lot of bumping in to each other. And the restaurant wasn't even that full. The food area is definitely not in proportion with the size of the restaurant. Food was worth it though.< /Text>< response>

Food started out great when first opened. Quality and service has declined. We gave it a second chance, but they just couldn't get it right. Food was not fresh, and seemed to be a little worse the second time around. I had hoped it was timing, but friends and family have had the same experience. Please save your money for a better restaurant/buffet.< /review>

<text>Food was alright, did not taste so bad, though some of them were cold & dry. Staff were nice. Ate some fried crab, craw fish, stir fried noodles, fried rice, some sushi and kimchi. I don't know why my throat has been hurting after I ate there. Had to take some Aleve hope it helped but it still hurts. Will not come back again.</text>< Pictures>

<Review>Top notch price for bottom of the bucket food. It was hard to find something edible on the Buffett. For 2 adults and two children it cost 66 dollars to eat. There are much better places to go around here.<//Review>< Rating>

I have been to this buffet before and considered it to be one of the best. This time was different. Most of my usual favorites were there but they were not hot. Everything on the buffet line was barely warm. It was all still quite tasty, but disappointing based on previous visits. I'll give them another try whenever I'm in the area again.< /review>

<Review>We went with our friends and kids a couple of days ago, and we had the worst experience ever. After two hours of eating there we all felt horible. We all were vomiting . The food is not fresh at all. You will make a very bad decision going there. Worst food ever... this kind of restaurants must be closed forever, people are in danger eating there...<//Review>< pics>

Great, consistent, Asian food in a buffet setting. Sushi, fresh grilled, soups, desserts, salads, fruits and mainland dishes. I return at least once a month. Never disappointed.</text>

Please don’t go eat at this restaurant the prices are high not that much variety and very poor customer service the waitress never asked if everything’s ok she only spy’s on you to make sure that your no sharing your soda with anybody i took a sip from my daughter drink and then my daughter asked for a refill and was denied because I had taking a sip from her cup and I asked to speak with a manger and they didn’t give me any info or name of the manger very rude and disrespectful people please save your money and spend it somewhere where they will have better food and better service<//text>

Food was not good. Flies. Employees kids running around, like 5 or 6. Dirty tables. Employee was having lunch at the table next to us, slurping a bowl of gross stuff. Windows looked like they were cleaned with a stick of butter. Waited a long time for dishes to be picked up. We should have walked out. This place was great a few years ago. Don't waste your money.<//review>

I am not sure why the others are saying the food isn't fresh and delicious.  It is every visit for me.  It must be the day and time of day I usually go (Sunday, about 1pm).  Everything is fresh and hot.  They couldn't restock crabs 🦀 fast enough. I enjoyed just about everything I normally would order at Chinese restaurants. I don't get food poisoning from eating there.

Three things I don't care for there: salad bar, sushi, and the grill to order meat. 1) Chinese food isn't about salad, it's about cook veggies. Don't eat that raw greens at buffet. 2) sushi is Japanese food. Chinese are notoriously bad at making sushi. If you ever had bad sushi, chances are the owner of that place is Chinese or Vietnamese.  3) I watch those guys grill...not sure what it is but they manage to burn the meat all the time. Plus they don't change tongs between raw and cooked meat. That's just asking for trouble. Avoid these 3 and you'll have a more enjoyable experience.

I dock a star for crappy service, as it is expected of Asian restaurants to have crappy service.<//Review>

One of the worst experiences ever the food look like it been out forever and cooked in old oil the pepper steak had no pepper no flavor it was like eating wet meat! The food was barely warm!  My wife and I could not even finish one plate! When we complained and asked for a discount we received a senior citizen discount which we could’ve got anyway so that was laughable! We will never be back and if you’re smart you’ll never go< /review>

If I could give them zero Stars I would. My wife and I went there to celebrate her birthday and our 10th anniversary. We went during the dinner rush and the food was horrible. Everything was either cold or overdone the sushi looked like it had been left out in the sun all brown and wrinkly. The fresh meat for the grill looked at least a month old some of it was indistinguishable. The hot and sour soup was anything but hot and sour more like slippery and slimy. The vegetables in the salad bar were wilted and not very fresh at all. The desserts were dry with no flavor. The ice cream came out of the machine like liquid. I didn't want to pay but I learned watching Judge Judy that if you eat the steak you have to pay for it and if you don't like it don't have to go back again and you couldn't give them a review that shows how I feel. I would not even sneak food out for my dog. So heed my warning it's not worth the money or the stomach ache I'm sure to have later.</review>

Very high quality food, including sushi and a variety of seafood dishes as well as a few American staples like pizza that seem more intended to suit fussy young guests than act as a main entree.<//Review>

<review>This Chinese buffet is glorious. Glorious. So much of so many kinds of food. So much food. Also I'll just say, they've often got pricey stuff in the buffet: crab legs, fish, shrimp, beef, Mongolian bar b que.
Fried foods.
Kid friendly foods (a whole line up of the kind of stuff kids who don't like Chinese food would like: fries, chicken nuggets, desserts, salad, etc). And two dozen more things. Classic American Chinese food: chow mein, been and broccoli, fried rice, General Tso's, orange chicken, etc etc. Also Soups. Crab Rangoon, egg rolls, pot stickers, teriyaki skewers. I truly cannot remember everything, just what I've tried.
Bring $12-15 and feast< /review>< Resp>

Way over priced horrible food. They honestly shouldn't be allowed to serve what they were giving us. Plus the tall server's that works their attempted to help us when our daughter spilt her drink, he went and got a rag wiped up maybe half of the split soda, laughed at my daughter, and walked away. Don't WASTE your money !!!!!!! I'm actually feeling kinda sick righting this.</text>

Rude front desk staff/supervisor/owner. Plates still wet. Food is not good for $16 price. We are  not done eating and they started cleaning with the smell of bleach. If you guys will accept guests last minute before you close, dont make us feel like you are rushing us.< /Review>

<text>The food was just ok. The service was TERRIBLE. The manager is extremely rude. We had called about prices before we went in. When we got our bill we were charged more then what we were told over the phone. When we asked about it the woman was extremely rude about. On top of that it was freezing inside! Customers were eating in their coats. The staff was walking around in winter coats. When we mentioned it they just looked at us and walked away !!!!

We came here when the place first opened for the day. The sushi was not the prettiest but we still got it thinking maybe it'll still be okay. It was probably the best thing we had but nothing special. I got a steamed oyster and shrimp, neither was clean on top of that both were bland. The rest of the food we got wasn't even heated to the right temps it was all luke warm. I 100% wouldn't take my friends or family here again.< /review>

I normally do not like buffets very much due to lack of variety. Golden koi though has it down right there's just enough of everything to keep you interested. Staff is alert. Food is great and there is a wide variety.< /Text>

The food was tasteless the crab legs were soggy it was the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted. Even the pot stickers were overcooked hot and sour soup was rancid tasting. I would not recommend that restaurant to anyone.</Review>

Not very good food, not warm , not clean... It was good long time ago, but I am not recommending it now. I gave 2/5 just because it's good location and nice building< /text>

<review>If I could rate them zero stars I would. We had a party of 12 for a bday. The entire 2 hours we had not one person come up and ask us for a refill.  And worst of all they didn't bother cleaning our plates off of the table. Second,  the lunch service food is absolutely disgusting. Tasteless and a waste of money. I think the only thing I ate there a d enjoyed it was the wonton soup. My kids didn't bother eating their pizza, French fried, chicken nuggets, doughnuts,  not even their fruit. I mean just terrible. Never coming here again. Not worth the time or money. There are plenty if other buffets in worse r off areas that are much better.< /review>< pics>

Love this place every time I go, awesome stuff besides one of the women behind the cashier counter, she's the one mostly sitting people, usually in a dress and her shoes she wears her heels on the outside, anyway she's the only rude person in the place, that is why I won't leave tips but love the place other then that< /Review>

Food is decent but the facility is neglected. There hasn’t been a toilet seat on the toilet in the men’s bathroom for a couple of visits. Had to ask to use the women’s bathroom for my 3 year old. The soap dispenser is also off the wall so no soap to wash hands. What do the employees do? Disgusting. Won’t be coming back here.<//Review>

I got two salmon sushi and had to spit them out. Tasted like day old sushi. Most of the food are not good even the order to grill meat.
The only okay food were split shrimp with cheese on top, order to grill shrimp, the ice-cream, the fruits. Everything else are horrible. My friends tried the oysters and they said they were okay, but I didn't dare to try.

The only redeeming value is the nice decorations and the place is huge, a lot of space. Price is good. I think it was $15.99 AYCE on July 4th. So that's probably dinner price.</Text><pictures>None</pictures>< resp>

I like the food,  for some reason though,  the back of the restaurant is incredibly,  uncomfortably cold.   I'd give them a 5 if it wasn't for the temperature issue.</text>

<Time>1425914416867</Time><rating>1</rating><Review>Just yesterday my family had lunch at Golden Koi Buffet. This was the first and last time we visited this place. We didn't find any outstanding food in comparison to other buffets, but service turned out to be much worse. For more than an hour while we were eating our lunch nobody even tried to offer a refill or pick up durty plates from our table. We had to make a tower of dirty plates and left-overs in the middle of table. It seemed like they have forgotten about us or just ignored. We didn't even receive our meal ticket at the end, so strongly decided not to leave any tip for such shoddy service. But voila ... 10% tip (or as they call it service charge) was already included to our bill. Any attempts to get it waved were unsuccesfull. SO, KEEP IN MIND BEFORE YOU GO TO Golden Koi THAT YOU'LL BE CHARGED 10% MANDATORY TIP WHETHER OR NOT YOU RECEIVE ANY SERVICE.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< Response>

The food was HORRIBLE and so was the service. I asked for fresh food and the owner said no one else was complaining. Very Rude and argumentitive. To boot my son got sick and is now throwing up. I suspect food poisoning. He said he NEVER wants to eat there again and neither do I.</Text>

Weekends are very busy and food quality has gone down since opening a few years back, but overall good for the price! I can only handle going once in a while due to the crowd hanging around the buffet in hopes to grab a plateful of crabs and shrimp first!</review>

Food is terrible... not warm, over cooked. Sushi is bad quality. The staff always changes. I used to be a fan of this place. Not anymore. Nice neighborhood, nice bulding and plaza. The temperature of the air is either too cold, or too hot. Currently hot. I would rather eat outside! 1 star for the building.<//Review>

<text>Absolutely HORRIBLE! I never write reviews unless they are pleasant, however I felt compelled to write this to warn others how disguting this place is & to help people save their money. I spent $31 bucks on garbage. The food tastes like its been sitting under those heat lamps all day. Huge health concern. The sushi/tuna was turning brown. The crab legs were filled with water and tasted like old fish...not crab! My sons chx nuggets were so hard he couldn't even bit into them. The dessert buffet is cookies they bought at wal mart, left them in the package & set out for people to grab....like really?? That's what I'm paying for? The wait staff is not friendly at all. Workers are playing on their phones behind the food counters, just ignoring you. I could go on and on and on....but I think you get the picture!!!!!<//text>< pics>

The cooks refilling the buffet were significantly more friendly and kept me updated on the ETA of what I was looking for.
They even looked me in the eyes as I was talking to them. I don't see a lot of that anymore.

I was going to give only a 2/5 star rating, but the cooks by themselves earned, and deserve, the third star.

- UPDATE -

Dropped to a 1/5 star. Prices are NOT posted. Adult dinner buffet is $16. Two children in our party, same age, charged different prices. Tip is added to the ticket. Our waiter didn't earn at time of anysize. I just had to wave him down to remove a stack of 4 plates. Total ticket for 2 adults, 2 children, and 2 softdrinks, and aadded tip... $51.04.

We will not be returning.</review><rating>1</rating><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Super disappointed. Food was not as good as before.  And then they wouldn't honor a free birthday dinner for my son because we didn't have his birth certificate. REALLY, who carries a birth certificate with them and he's only 15, so he doesn't have a license yet. We had a party of 6 people, so needless to say we won't be back😣😣<//Text>

Food is horrible, it's cold and you can tell it's been sitting there for a very long time! Worst service ever, couldn't even get water! Stood in line to have chicken cooked for me and 20 min later they got one of the bust boys to cook it. No one was there restocking the buffet trays so the food options were very low. Place is dirty! Will never go back!!</review>

Bottom Line...the food is awful. I don't have high expectations for a Chinese buffet but this place sucks. There were a couple good things but for the $12 or $14 or whatever it is for lunch, it was a complete waste of my time and money.< /Review>

<Review>The service was wonderful, the people were very friendly, and were definitely on top of things. As for the food, it's mostly seafood oriented, so if you can't eat seafood or don't generally enjoy it, the number of items is severely limited. If you are a seafood buff, it looks very appetizing and I was very excited to see whole cooked crawfish among their selections, not something you generally see west of the Mississippi. I was also happy to see the bean-paste filled items, something my family greatly enjoys when we go to any oriental themed restaurant.
The soft serve ice cream, though, was definitely refreshing, having a vanilla custard flavor that was very delicious as opposed to the run-of-the-mill watered down vanilla you can find standard in a lot of other oriental buffets.
I would've been a lot happier, though, if there had been more beef-based products, or dishes that didn't have fattier-ended meats. The General Tso's chicken is also VERY Americanized, very sweet with very little spicy and sour. My current take-out place wins over The Golden Koi.<//Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

<Text>My 2 friends followed me in, they didnt eat because they had just finished eating greasy Mcdonalds. I told the staff it's only me eating and immediately they motioned their frail asian waitress to watch us like a hawk for the entire duration to make sure I did not pass a single rice grain or grape to my friends. No water refill. Napkins came right before they gave me the [charge fee ticket on the tray] to go pay. I ate at lunch time and it lasted to the crossover of dinner, they plastered many "Dinner only" signs above their newly switched better food trays to deter me from tasting it. Their bathroom is so dark to the point of it being spooky, you might start thinking about Freddy Kruger lurking in there. But really, the darkness is a slip hazard. The staff has no personality at all, they're all doing the mannequin challenge up until its time to take payments, then back to weird mode. Dessert section is horrible. 3pm Lunch time foods was obviously from 11am due to visible limp brown broccoli. I'm not talking about brown gravy all over it, Im saying the heat lamp destroyed greenness of the vegetables. Even the onions have wilted to fetal positions. Bendable  carrots. No crisp snap. Do not try their cheesecake, it tastes just like a flavorless styrofoam or a dish washing sponge (texture!)< /Text><pics>None<//pics><response>None< /response>< GmapID>

<review>Food was terrible , my girlfriend didn't even eat it, she tried a salad, but that too wasn't good, how to you mess up salad? When we told the people who work there, they said to us oh well its always the same.. I think they may be right, re-heated food it tasted like.

Stay away from this place,  YUK!  We wasted 40 bucks that night.<//review><pics>None<//pics><resp>None<//resp><GmapID>0x809b21ee172bf235:0x1c377604113065c2</GmapID></record>

<text>Food was all lukewarm and bland. Sushi was alright, but not worth going for. Service was good (they took our plates and filled our drinks quickly), except for the fact that I think they just topped off my drink with soda water instead of actually refilling it.

Would not go again.</text>< username>

<review>Went in for my son's 11th birthday dinner because that is what he asked for. We provided documents to show his age, birth certificate, and then asked for his ID to provide him his birthday "surprise" that they provide. The place was empty and I now understand why, service is terrible. We haven't eaten there before and never will.< /review>< resp>

The worst place I ever visited. Very dirty inside. And they try to charge 10% tips in your payment slip, so if you don’t like it, don’t pay them tips for they not deserve it.<//review>

The food is ok depending on what you select.  The dessert selection is not good the ice cream is never working good.  Golden Koi Buffet needs to step it up on cleanliness and fresher food.  But remember it is a buffet.< /Review>

(Translated by Google) The food is very bad, shrimp any two or three days old, the appetizers are hard bread and gelatin. The whole rice was also hard as days. And now I don't even follow him ... I went by recommendation, but I'm not going to stop there again. 😖

(Original)
Muy mala la comida,camarones cualquiera como de dos o tres dias,los aperitivos el pan y gelatina duros. El arroz todo duro tambien como de dias. Y ya mejor ni le sigo... Fui por recomendacion pero ni loco me vuelvo a parar ahi. 😖<//review>
