<Text>I'll be honest, my pets are my "kids". I have young human children too, but to me my dogs are on the same level. I say that because I am as particular about my vets as I am about my pediatricians... Santa Rosa Veterinary Hospital is second to none. They are honest, communicative, and above all, they treat my furbaby like their own. The gals who answer the phones are the best--they take the time to listen and really seem to care, no matter why I'm calling. We have a pretty intense-looking husky that has scared other veterinarians, but at SRVH they are used to all breeds and sizes and they treat all animals with respect. I highly recommend this veterinary hospital.< /Text></record></dataset><record>

< review>
Since they are one of the few places around still open, I was expecting to pay a lot. However, the veterinary hospital only charged a few hundred (100-400, I forget) for getting my little boy up to date on all his vaccines, tested him for FIV and feline leukemia virus (negative on both!), and most of that cost was for the doctors time. When I went back to get a booster shot for him, they only charged the cost of the vaccine!
Very affordable, fair price. Very kind and professional staff. Would highly recommend!</review>

However, they staff were amazing and Jean went above and beyond to get our new birds in anyway. We are SO grateful to all the staff for their care of us and our new babies Buddy, Marcus, and Amelia.

< review>
A year ago, I moved to Santa Rosa from Nashville where I had a great vet for my two Cavalier King Charles Spaniels, Nugget and Brody, so I did extensive research on the best place in town to bring my "kids." Dr. Krome, Dr Lester, and their whole team did not disappoint. Everyone is always friendly and helpful. The manager, Hannah (also a vet tech/anesthesiologist and dog trainer extraordinaire), has always gone above and beyond to take care of my pups. She even coordinated an after hours visit for urgent lab tests when Nugget was unwell, texted the results to Dr. Krome, and we had a diagnosis and plan in under an hour. On another occasion, the front office coordinators allowed me to pay over the phone and arranged for me to pick up Brody's prescription after they had closed, so he wouldn't miss a dose over the weekend. I am so grateful for this intelligent, hard working, and truly caring team. THANK YOU!< /review>

The staff at SR Veterinary are always so kind and friendly. I needed some pet medications during the shelter-in-place order. They had a little extra instruction so as to not have a crowded waiting room. When I arrived, I called from my car, and they had me come right in. They still had smiles on their faces.<//Text>

<text>Never did I ever think I'd find myself at the Vet with a hamster. After calling around all morning (it's very hard to find a small animal vet here) I finally found Santa Rosa Veterinary Hospital. They were EXCEPTIONAL in every way. Super friendly, easy to schedule, everyone was very helpful and informative. We left with a happy healthy hamster and I'd definitely recommend them to anyone ♡< /text>< Pics>

Highly recommended!  Staff was friendly, caring and approachable.  Dr. Krome is awesome!  Very knowledgeable and treated my dog with care.  He explained how to approach her treatment very clearly and encouraged me to call or email with questions at any time emphasizing that I could contact him anytime and as much as needed and it would not be bothering him.  I felt totally confident that he would manage my dog's complex issues very well.  I feel like this is the best veterinarian that I've ever been to!</text>

I am very pleased with this veterinary hospital.  The staff is friendly, the facility is clean, and they are open 6 days a week.  I have taken my conure Panik in twice now, for a general checkup and for a wing clipping.  Dr. Krome is very knowledgeable about parrots and is very gentle and loving.  I just can't say enough good things about him, I'm so happy that he is here in Santa Rosa.<//Review>

<review>I had to take my moms dog to get his nails cut and I called to see how much it was and told the lady on the phone we would be in shortly and she said ok.

HOWEVER- When my fiance and I got there she said we needed to have an appointment and when I said I had called ahead of time and the lady never said anything about an appointment. She denied ever speaking to me on the phone! Even though she confirmed the name of my moms account and the name of the dog!

Living in windsor and going back and forth wasn't fun but it had to get done. So if you are planning on going here please make sure you make an appointment. Other than that the nail trimming went fast and we were in and out.< /review><response>{'time': 1584557439904, 'text': 'We are very sorry that we inconvenienced you.

<review>TAKE YOUR FUR BABY HERE! Great experience here from the first phone call! Every single staff member is really caring and straight forward which is greatly appreciated. They communicate quickly and efficiently! Dr. Krome is quick with a response on email and filling prescription request. Front office staff was more than helpful after we had trouble getting records from the last vet. And we really loved the tech too who was very transparent with us. Outstanding all around!
We had adopted a senior cat back in January, which EVERY staff member thanked us for at different times, and went elsewhere where they "diagnosed" him with lymphoma but wanted us to do charge us for more tests after an overnight stay and wouldn't give our cat any kind of medication to make him feel better when we took him home until we set up a consultation with a specialist despite their two tests not being conclusive. Dr. Krome gave us the ability to make our cat comfortable with the time he has left from the first visit. We are extremely grateful to have found this place.<//review>< Pics>

I was really happy with there customer service and how well they took care of our cat (Smokey) not only was I in and out real quick, but there was another customer that was rude and inpatient, they handle it with the most professional manner. I highly recommend this place.< /Text>

This is the best clinic in town. The staff is very caring and loves to spend time with your pet. The Dr. is a down to earth man who takes the time to go over everything with you. I have never felt like he was in a rush to get me out the door so he could get to the next thing he had to do. He found a treatment for my dog that has made a huge change in our life. He is like a puppy again wanting to play and run.< /text>

<rating>5< /rating><text>Dr. Krome lifted my burden of worries over my elder bird Peachtree's mobility problems. I was happy to see he is a kind and caring vet and felt relieved that my bird was safe in his diagnosis. Although my bird loudly proclaimed his protests, I feel sure that deep in his heart he felt safe, too. Great vet and great staff.

We just moved from Canada to the US and had excellent vet care in our home country.  We were worried about finding a good vet here in Santa Rosa, but one meeting with Dr. Bloomberg and we know we've found the best.  Not just the best here, but the best we've EVER had.  He's kind, extremely knowledgeable and takes his time with each animal he sees, providing all the details you need and more to make good decisions about your pet's care. The rest of the staff are amazing, too.

We're extremely happy and feel very fortunate to have found Santa Rosa Veterinary Hospital.  Highly recommended.</review>

My first visit today and I am very happy with the clinic. Everyone was so friendly and I loved Dr. Stephen Krome!!! He's the best! He took his time with me and my cat and it really showed that he really cares about my cat's health.☺ I am very glad that I ran across the clinic on the Internet.☺ I feel very comfortable with the clinic and I do believe that I have found a good place for my cat.☺And, I felt they are reasonably priced.☺< /review>

<Review>I can't say enough about Dr. Krome and his staff.  We have been going to Dr. Krome for the past two years with a very challenging dog who is afraid of everyone and everything.  He was so patient with her and helped us learn so much more about what she needed.  Unfortunately, we had to put our Lucy dog down last week, and he couldn't have been more helpful, understanding and caring.  We were so lucky and appreciative of him coming to are home to take care of our girl.  I would give him and his team 10 starts if I could.  The greatest vet ever!</Review>< pictures>

You do have to pay but they always go above and beyond what you pay for.  Great people from the front office to the back.  If you love your pet like family and want to take care of them from the front to the back this is the place to go!  Trust me i don't have a lot of money but when I got my dogs back, I was 100% satisfied with every dime I spent!  I've been to a few vets in Sonoma County and not only is this the best priced but the best care my pets ever received.  Don't waste your time elsewhere The Santa Rosa Veterinary Hospital is the only place you need to go. To hell with 5 stars I give them 100 stars!!!!<//Text>< response>

I have been using this vet for about 2 years and they have always been very kind to me and my cat -  I couldn't be happier.  Big bonus points for a smooshed-face office cat that lives there named Dobi.<//Review>

<rating>5</rating><Review>I don't usually write reviews it was Google reviews that helped me figure out where to go next after waiting for an hour at my previous vet's office only to be told it wad going to be at least another half hour before I could be seen due to an emergency. This was the second time this had happened to me there and while I appreciate the fact there was an emergency, I should've been told on the outset.

So I picked Santa Rosa Veterinary Hospital due to it's Goolge reviews.  They were able to get my cat in that day, and explained from the beginning it would be a wait (they too had an emergency) in part because they were double booking to get us in.  The wait wasn't more than a half hour. The staff were great, the doctor was fantasic. He even gave me his email address incase I had any questions down the road. I highly recommend Santa Rosa Veterinary Hospital. I will definitely be using them again.< /Review>< pictures>

All of our animals have been to Dr. Krome at one time or another since he bought the practice.  He is the best as is all the staff at the hospital.

Dr. Krome is very open, friendly and knowledgable.  He works with you and your pet.  I highly recommend SRVH for any veterinary needs you may have.</Review>

Dr. Krome,   his vet tech's,  and office personnel were excellent in the care of my Siberian Husky.
They went above the standard of care.  They provided comfort for a fearful dog.  He tolerated the procedure pre and post operatively great due to their guidance. It's great to know your pet is in good hands, after having a bad experience at another SR yet .
Thank you kindly</Text>

Lauren charmed our pup from the get-go,  Dr. Krome answered all of our questions and calmed all fears (human and canine alike) And the bonus was a special pedicure for the doggie, who being a very paw shy critter was handled with grace and kind care. Big thanks to the front office folks, Megan and Jean and also the clinic staff, Lauren, Dean and Dr. Krome. We've found a new vet and couldn't be happier about it!

<review>I have had cats all my life, and been to various vets over the years. So, it is with this basis for comparison that I can say Dr. Krome is excellent.

I was worried about taking Maximus anywhere. I inherited him a year ago, and the previous owner said she had never taken him to the vet. He doesn't like to be picked up, and I was worried about stuffing him in a cat carrier and hauling him away from home for some poking, prodding and shots.

Max didn't like the trip (to be expected), but Dr. Krome and his staff were top notch in how they handled him. Max endured it all (even the thermometer in his backside) with surprising calm.

The surprise for me was the bill, which was lower than I expected. When I read the other reviews, I discovered a 2011 review where a pet owner wrote a long diatribe about rates. It certainly didn't match my experience. And, to be fair, it should be noted that Dr. Krome didn't own the business then, either.

I particularly like the fact that his vet has a special certification for cat handling--not something all vets can claim.

All said, I highly recommend Dr. Krome and Santa Rosa Veterinary Hospital!<//review>< Date>

I'm writing this the night after we had to put our beloved senior cat down. This hospital has been nothing short of amazing to us. Their prices are much more affordable than others and they were unbelievably compassionate every time we've seen them. When we visited to checkup on bloodwork etc (he was very old and we had a number of visits before today) they would talk with us and share about how good he was, and all the things we both thought were funny about him. We walked away for the last time having cried WITH the vet, and it didn't feel so alone, or full of regret. Thank you for everything.</Review>

< review>
The girl that helped my son with the pony ride is super sweet. However, when you advertise a petting zoo and the cost is $40, people are probably going to expect to pet more than just goats. Yeah, the goats are cute. But when I think petting zoo, I think multiple different animals. $40, is a little steep to pet some goats and for 30 mins at that. I definitely wouldn't tell my friends to check it out and I wouldn't return.<//review>

My daughter love the sound of horses and as she was riding Gretta was conversing with her friends around the ranch. Call ahead and make a reservation even same day. I got in 45 minutes before (probably a cancelation) for the cash only (specified on the website) for the pony ride. I wanted to do the petting zoo but they were all booked<//Review>< Date>

<review>Fond memories that I will cherish for a long time from my trip to San Diego with my bro and my new sister in law.
Our horses, Gracie, Honey and Pamela were a perfect match to our temperaments. Bianca, the trainer is not only very passionate about her craft but is also extremely knowledgeable and has a great eye for photography. My horse Gracie knew exactly what to do through out the excursion. She was extremely well trained, a real pro. I would have loved to have trotted more but that all depends on what your overall group level is and I came out of it in pretty bad shape (good pain) by the end of it anyways!
Looking forward on riding the bull on my next visit😋<//review>< Gmap_id>

We had a great 1.5 hour ride with our family of four. The trail was interesting and the horses were magnificent. Some of our group were experienced and others first-timers. Everyone had a great time. Our guide, Bianca, made it extra fun and special. We look forward to our next ride!<//Review>

Friendly staff, the horses were great. It was my boyfriend's first ride and it couldn't have give nicer. It takes about 50 minutes to get out to the beach and since it was his first time we decided to go for 2 hours to get a little of everything. Now he can't wait for his next ride.< /Review>

It was a great time! The horses all seemed so well taken care of and our guide Bianca was amazing. She really made the experience enjoyable since my wife was a little bit nervous in the beginning. She went at an easy comfortable pace for us. Highly recommended!<//Review>

We had a great guide, he was very friendly and really down to earth and fun to talk to. Although there were about 10 or more horses that were in a paddock that was not very large and it should not have had more than 2 in there and they were up to their ankles in mud and water, they had plenty of food and water but they were dirty and seemed very unhappy. Our horses were sweet though and we had a nice ride, again our guide was awesome and made it a much better experience than we were expecting than when we got there.< /review>

<Time>1578145605574< /Time><Rating>2<//Rating><Review>We went out on Christmas Eve just me and my wife. Signed up for the early bird.Showed up 30 minutes early for our 8:30 ride. Finally at 8:30 after not seeing anyone I called and they said they’d be 5 more minutes. At least 20 minutes later someone showed up. Then we had to wait for someone else to do our paperwork. After 9 she showed up and said someone was supposed to call me the day before and tell us we were no longer doing the early bird because there was only two of us and tried to charge us more for the ride. Finally we get on the trail, our guide was so sick or “something” that she had to stop once and throw up and another time she was saying she was going to projectile vomit off her horse and was trying to get us to ride ahead of her so we didn’t see it. We are beginners and it felt extremely unsafe. I was trying to think of what I was going to do if she passed out and fell off her horse and I had to get her and her horse back. My wife was scared for the first half of the ride. I tipped and didn’t complain at the time because it was Christmas Eve and I’m pretty easy going. It would have been terrifying to think if it was a large family with children. On the beach a wave crashed and my wife’s horse spooked and took off, that spooked mine and it tried to take off. By the time we were on our way back we felt a little more comfortable with our horses. In the end it felt like a self guided tour. We made the best of it and it made for a good story, I guess. Just be carful, nobody at this business even acknowledged all that went wrong with our experience.<//Review><pics>None</pics>< Response>

<Review>Amazing experience! Horses are well trained. My husband and I did the early morning beach ride and it was beautiful.  Well worth the money for 3 hours of scenery and quality time on horseback. Definitely bring a jacket if you are doing the beach ride because of the strong breeze.< /Review><pictures>None<//pictures>< response>

My husband and I came here on our honeymoon and it was by far the best experience of our trip! Our guide was so much fun and talked to us the entire time! Our horses Maverick & Snickers were ADORABLE & such characters! We did the swim adventure and that was such an unforgettable experience! Sitting on a swimming horse was so amazing to feel how strong they are to put your trust in them... just amazing! We will definitely do this again! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!</Text>

<Text>My husband & I are on vacation from Houston Texas. Decided to do something adventurous & went horse back riding. Had a wonderful time. Lauren was our tour guide she was excellent. I would highly recommend requesting her. She gave great information along the ride , professional, went out of her way to take several good pictures with my phone & when my phone couldn’t take any more photos she took several with her phone & sent them to me immediately, Lauren is also a great conversationalist. I was nervous being a first time rider but Lauren took me step by step & made me feel at ease. Lauren took us down the trails down to the beach. Great ride great experience thank you Lauren.</Text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

<text>Great experience today. The staff was super nice and helpful. We had only been on horses once before, so we were pretty unfamiliar with everything. Our guides, Masha and Kristen, calmed any fears we expressed, taught us what we needed to know, and engaged with the kids to enhance their experience. We had two adults and three kids (ages 8, 9, and 8) and appreciated the patience of the staff and pace of our ride because it made everything less intimidating.

It was also really evident that they love their animals and treat them well. The kids loved seeing horses, mules, a camel, a zebra, llamas, pigs, goats, a cow, a tortoise-everything!< /text><Pics>None<//Pics><Response>None</Response>< gmap_id>

From being organized with booking our ride only two days before we went, to taking us on a beautiful little trip to the beach, this experience was perfection.
Tara was our guide for the day and she's delightful. She was engaging and interested, knowledgeable and patient. She tended to our every need and made us so very comfortable.
The horses are lovely, though I'd ask for at least one gelding in the mix if you're a beginner rider (an all-female group can be a bit dicey).
All in all we had a fabulous time. When they tell you to put on bug spray, do it. There are at least forty million mosquitos...all of which bit me. And I was wearing bug spray.
I would recommend this company any day! And I'll be back (once my bug bites heal!) And I'll be bringing my hubby. He'll love it too.</text>

<text>My daughter is moving to San Diego from Florida for the summer. We have horses and I wanted to leave her with a horse experience that would soften the ache of missing her own horse. We did a sunset, beach ride here. I must say, it was one of the best memories my daughter and I shared. Extremely nice and knowledgeable people and great horses. I would say this is a must do for anyone visiting San Diego. I highly recommend this establishment.< /text>< Pictures>

<text>I called same-day to set up a sunset beach ride for my boyfriend and I. Although they didn't have someone to answer the phone, I was called back promptly and they were able to answer my questions and they had an availability. When we arrived they had 2 beautiful mares for us. While we waited for a returning group to dismount we walked around and saw all their other horses and animals. Our trail guide Terra was very friendly! It was great to have a private ride, the trails weren't busy, and we were the only ones on the beach. I was happy to have horse that tolerated the water and was allowed to walk in it. Another highlight was seeing dolphins! Terra packed waters for us, made sure we had a good pace, and offered to take pictures of us. The whole experience was wonderful and I would recommend it for both beginners and experienced riders.<//text>< userid>

Had a great time, my friend and i booked last minute and we're able to do the three hour ride to the beach. Everyone was very happy and excited to do their job. Little petting zoo to distract you while you wait and the horses were healthy and well trained. My horse, Sarge, was awesome, though everyone thought he was slow. Allie, hope i spelt it right, was very happy to be our guide and very happy and easy to talk to which made the tour more relaxing. She packed water for us, offered helmets and sun screen and bug spray is available too. Trails and beach was private and relaxing, didn't feel like an amusement ride but just friends going out for a ride which was great.  She took our photo, gave us some history and answered all question. Really recommend and i will be coming back, next time for the surf ride.<//text>

However, I noticed  before we had even begun our ride they had a huge group get back and they didn't have any fresh horses for us. They put us on two horses that had just been out (it's a two hour long ride round trip), without watering them or letting them rest. I beleive I said something, but they said they were fine. My husband's horse was falling behind the whole trip. I felt terrible. I would have rather have waited for them to rest, and get water, or turned back to switch horses. Some horses are slower on trail I know (I worked with trailguides at Camp Pendleton Stepp Stables for years), but I honestly think this horse was exhausted. I wish we had turned back. It bothers me to this day. I hope they have better management now, or that that was a rare accurance. Please be mindful of the well being of your animals,  and at the very least water them if you have to take them back out, and let them rest! People can wait. We could have waited.<//Text>< pictures>

Our horses have access to water all day long when saddled in the catch pen and have a water trough that they are walked by when the riders dismount and walked by again when new riders mount up.  Sometimes they do not choose to drink, but they always have access to water.  Thank you for your concerns as we care deeply for all of our animals on our property."}< /Resp>

We're both experienced riders and when they asked on the website what was our ridding's skills, we were hoping to ride horses matching those skills. The horses were both very tired, on the website it is written than we can not gallop and I totally understand but we couldn't even trot. I've been ridding for more than 15years so I was clearly disappointed.

We did the trail ride which is only a big square ride behind the ranch, the landscape was always the same, not very interesting.

An other point that was very disturbing for me was that the horses are tide up all day long with their saddle on their back, and they are not even clean. I think that when you work with horses like that you owe them respect and at least clean them every morning before putting the saddles on. And it would certainly be better for the horses if the saddles were taken off after each ride. I know it takes a lot of time but i really think that the horses' health is more precious than the few minutes they would loose by taking the saddle off and on.

The only positive point was the guide, I don't remember her name but she was really nice to us, we were new in San Diego, freshly arrived from Europe and she gave us some nice addresses in our neighborhood.</text>< Pictures>

<user_name>Michelle Miller</user_name><Text>Took a lovely and gentle ride down near Imperial Beach and along the Tijuana River Valley Preserve. Very relaxing and just what I needed to wind down from work. Never really felt the need to trot the horse...just walking while taking in the beauty of the area. I took the 3hr ride so I could experience all the landscape from the beach to dry creekbeds with nasturtiums popping up around us. Well worth it and I can definitely recommend San Diego Beach Rides. It is a slow, peaceful ride...so if you are wanting to trot or gallop your horse this is not the place for you.< /Text><user_id>108184126404432750779<//user_id></record>

<review>This place is so fair,  great pricing,  beautiful rides,  horses are great.  Ive been leasing horses for two years now,  and some people are fair and others are scammers.  San Diego Beach rides is by far the best place I've been in all of San Diego and North County.  Horse guide Nyna is the best guide ive ever experienced.  We are so lucky this place is here for us to be able to enjoy and not worry about rip offs.  Love,  Gina:)<//review>< pictures>

Dr. Ley is the nicest veterinarian! She is so kind and thorough.. answered all of my millions of questions [I had a page of questions to talk to her about] and she even followed up by sending me an email to help me navigate the online website to order medications. You can tell she loves animals and her profession. My older white bulldog had a little red spot on her abdomen that frightened me for skin cancer and I was so relieved after she examined my dog, she put all my fears at ease. Definitely worth the drive from Santa Maria to see Dr Ley! We cannot express just how much we love her!<//Text>

She even helped give me advice about my parents' dog who lived in another area! All of the techs were really sweet and great with my critters, too. My dog is bad with other dogs, and everyone was very accommodating of him and understanding, and loved him anyway. I recently moved out of the area so I unfortunately had to move to another vet, but Dr Taylor gave me a recommendation for a vet in my new area who is working out really well.

Dr. Diana's care and her skill in homeopathy has been a true Godsend not only in helping our dog but in comforting us and giving us hope. She is a treasure. The staff have all been very kind and helpful. We live in the LA area and have a lot of vets to choose from here but we drive two hours to take our dog to Buellton. It is worth it.</review>< response>

We have been going to BVC for 24 years with multiple pets.  The vets are outstanding, caring doctors and the staff equally so. In an emergency, they find time to fit you in, and send timely, helpful reminders for regular checkups and vaccination renewals. We give them the 5 stars they deserve.<//review>

Our cat got sick and we needed a last minute appointment on a Saturday. They got us in and taken care of quickly. The office is beautiful, staff is incredibly welcoming, and the bill wasn't outrageous. We will definitely be making them our go-to for veterinary care.<//text>

Wonderful place and people. Our dogs love the care they receive and are very comfortable with everyone. The docs are so good with them and the kennel is fantastic so I always feel the dogs are safe and well-cared for. Thank you to everyone at the clinic.</text>

<text>I give this vet service a 5 star rating for care. However, I feel ripped off and every time I go through the door. The dental care quotes are absolutely ridiculous and I'm used to paying Santa Barbara prices. My Buellton neighbors whom I have spoken with all agree, many of them tell me not to go for this reason.  I like everyone who works here and my dogs have gotten great care but I just felt the need to express this frustration.</text><name>Laura Hubbard<//name><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80eeaa5b28299deb:0x66eed601609af14d</GmapID>< user_id>

My dog always seems a little sad when i pick her up because she receives more love and attention there then she does at home. I cant see myself ever going anywhere else and I always refer both my friends and family there.  We travel often and I never worry about my little guy being lonely or miserable.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Our family of three cats has been in the care of BVC for 12 years.  They truly care about their patients and love their careers. We always receive professional and nurturing attention in their care.  There work in saving and fostering animals is an appreciated bonus.<//text>

Dr. Diana at Buellton Veterinary Clinic is the best! I turned to her and homeopathic remedies when all the conventual treatments failed to help my itchy border collie. It's amazing how much better he is doing without any drugs with all their harmful side-effects. So grateful to have found her since there isn't anyone local and she will consult by email and phone.</Text>

<date>1471573444983</date><Review>My poodles and I have been clients at Buellton Veterinary Clinic for over 30 years.  The doctors and staff at BVC are professional, knowledgable, and compassionate when talking to and treating my special canine family members.  The ability of the doctors to diagnose unusual illnesses in my animals is a talent I have witnessed and I appreciate. The option of using complementary treatments (homeopathy, acupuncture, chiropractic) in addition to traditional Western medicine is available at Buellton Veterinary Clinic and has been used for my dogs.  And my poodles visit the grooming parlor (Groomer Julie) at Buellton Veterinary Clinic monthly and receive compliments when they are out and about in public.  Thank you to the entire staff at Buellton Veterinary Clinic.<//Review>< gmapID>

<Text>We started taking our dog, Kiki, to Buellton Vet Clinic when we moved down here from the Bay Area.  My sister always took her dog there, and when little Lizzie started to decline in health, the vets there were so kind and took such good care of her, while also being so mindful of my sister's impending loss.  They helped both Lizzie and my sister through the whole dying and grieving process.  Our whole family uses BVC, driving from Lompoc and from Santa Barbara.  My daughter recently adopted a little rescue pup who has some *interesting* back leg issues and they have already started to give her guidance and help in that area.  So really, I wouldn't take my pets anywhere else.  These people are wonderful.< /Text>< Pics>

Dr. Diana Bochenski saved my Flat-Coated Retriever, Athan, who was on point of death from intractable IBD when Dr. Bochenski entered the picture. Athan had been to two universities and seen numerous specialists over a period of seven months. Nothing had helped, and the doctors had run out of tests and ideas. He'd had $11,000 of the best veterinary care, yet no one could find an answer. The meds and treatments he'd been prescribed either did nothing or made him sicker. He was shriveling away before my eyes, and his (lack of) quality of life had reached the crisis point.

Then Dr. Bochenski took over his case, and with a single homeopathic remedy she not only saved his life but restored him to full health and vitality. It's been a scant five weeks since she entered the case, but Athan is rocking again in competitive agility and obedience, activities he loves that seemed forever out of reach. I would've been thrilled just to keep him alive, yet here he is, the picture of health.

Truly, it's a miracle, and the miracle worker resides at Buellton Vet Clinic.< /Text>

Great rock cod sandwich. Lunch to go was easy and the choices were diverse. My wife got a delicious cioppino and i ordered the rock cod sandwich. Other staples like pastrami, cheese, and cole slaw, roast beef, and ham sandwiches were available too. Great service, good choices. Moderately pricey but worth it... Especially the fresh fish lunches.< /review>

<text>Friendly staff and there’s a nice outdoor picnic area in back that gets sun. However, the wait times were just way too long for sandwiches and soups- we did a lap around Mendocino and sat for a while and still our order wasn’t ready until the third time we checked. When we did get the food the soups were cold and we had to go back to get them warmed up. Also, wouldn’t recommend the clam chowder, very watery.<//text><pictures>None<//pictures>< Resp>
{'time': 1605407674987, 'text': 'Dear Emre,\nMy name is Sandy and I own the Mendocino Market & Deli. I am glad you enjoyed good customer service at my shop. I am not surprised by this as we are a staff of quality & awesome people. We have a tiny kitchen built into a house that was built in the 1800’s. Due to health codes and our square footage we are allowed to accommodate a total of five employees at a time during the Covid-19 pandemic. One one the door, one on the grill, one on cold side, one doing everything, and a dishwasher.  Our grill can accommodate no more than about 15 orders at a time because it is quite small. Our phones ring off the hook with orders as well as everyone waiting outside. We are not lazy and we want quality sent out the door. We are one of a total of six open restaurants in the village serving hundreds a day and my husband and I do not take breaks or even eat until the end of the day. I had my son (dishwasher) heat up your cup of seafood stew because I was overwhelmed with phone orders and such. We heat the stew to order so that it does not overcook the prawns throughout the day in a soup warmer. I am so sorry he did not heat it properly the first time. He is learning. We show up every day during this pandemic and work masked at every moment for your safety. I am happy for you that you get to travel and eat out   I would, however, ask for your patience. We are just a family working our guts out to serve you and the community.\nThank you for considering what it is like for those of us inside working tirelessly on the behalf of those of you who can enjoy our quality food.\nSandy'}< /Resp>

If you've never had a sandwich from Mendo Market and you're local, can you even call yourself one ??? When my son visits from LA this is the only place he ever wants to eat at.   The staff are always super friendly!<//review>

<Rating>5<//Rating><text>This was a nice place to come get some lunch and chill for a little bit! I had the clam chowder with some sourdough bread and it was delicious; it was very creamy, hot, and had some nice tender clam morsels and potato pieces. A good hardy soup for a cold day. My boyfriend also had a hot pastrami sandwich I think..? He was definitely enjoying it and we're happy we stopped here. They also had a really good honey vanilla cream soda that was super sweet! You don't wanna look at the label though Haha it was very high in sugar so we shared it :) Also one of the owners was there, I think his name was Eric, he was super nice and helpful; he recommended some of the menu items to us. He was friendly and seemed laid back which was nice and made the atmosphere comfortable for us. When we went to sit down he also wiped our table down for us which was very considerate of him. It wasn't too crowded or anything either which was nice because sometimes little places can get loud really fast with just a few people but it wasn't like that here. I would recommend this place if you're looking for somewhere nice to get a soup or sandwich for lunch and to just kind of relax for a little bit after walking around town.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>None< /resp><gmapID>0x80804d34456686eb:0x3e7f588a95d4cd92< /gmapID></record></dataset><record>

The selection of beer was awesome and very friendly and nice but sadly our yummy sandwich had barly any meet and tons of veggies was really yummy tasting but husband was really upset he got one bite of meat barly maybe 2 slices of pastrami in it! Really could of used a little more meat at least at the price we paid!< /Text>

< review>
Used to be REALLY good deli food but I got some awful shrimp/ crab cakes that looked good in the case but were such a disappointment. And they didn't have the walnut chocolate chip cookies,  either, so double disappointment.< /review>

Fresh, tasty, and well priced (for Mendocino) hot and cold sandwiches make this a great place to stop by and get provisioned before hiking along the headland.</Review>

Mendo Market takes sandwiches to the next evolutionary phase. The chipotle chicken special is probably illegal in some states.< /review>

I often take my friends to this place with my warmest recommendations. I visit this restaurant often. I get very good feedback from my friends. The dishes they serve are appetizing and the team is efficient and cooperative. Whenever we visit this place we have a lovely evening.  highly recommended.< /text>

The worst Mexican food restaurant I have ever tried, last Friday night we went to eat medudo and shrimp fajitas and the menudo was horrible, it smelled like a dead animal nothing to do with the typical smell of a menudo, I told the waitress what was wrong with the menudo and she told me that this is usually how the menudo is sold, the shrimp in my fajitas had skin and the skin was super black, which means that the shrimp were super old and smelled very bad too, luckily we only ate two bites of our plates and left immediately. Most likely they gave us food spoiled, gross, we will never return to that place!!!!<//review>

Came here last night for my second time. After a hectic first visit on cinch de mayo this year, this place seems to have calmed down and gotten their act together.</Review>

Drove over 15 miles to come here.  They refused to accept our coupon which has their address,  name and expiration date of Dec.  31, 2020. We had to wait to get service when there was only one other party in the restaurant at 11:40 in the afternoon.  Service was horrible.  We left and went elsewhere.< /Review>

Place is super loud on Sunday night. You can’t even hear yourself talk nor the waiter. Asked multiple times to lower it down to only them cranking up the volume even more, my 4 month old kept on crying. Carne asada plate was good but too little on the plate.<//Text>

I had made an appointment online with Natalie but when we arrived we were helped by Chris, he was nice but it was extremely difficult to understand him. He did not advise us on what the best thing to do was, we recently got married and when we asked for advise on how to file next year he didn't really give us an answer. I've always loved H&R Block for the great customer service but I feel like this time around it was just about filling the taxes and nothing else.<//text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Mia is wonderful. From welcoming me with a smile to remembering little things we’ve discussed in years passed, she truly has the best customer service. She takes her time to makes sure I understand the process and doesn’t rush me when something requires a little more time; I truly feel like she cares. Tax laws change and this year was kind of a bummer with new limits and such but she was able to find me the best case scenario for the current climate. I’ll be back to see her in early 2020 :)<//Review>< Pictures>

I'm very frustrated by the price I had to pay when adding a 10-99 form. I wasn't informed on the price increase prior to completing my taxes. When initially asked why I was using h and r block I stated I do my own taxes but because of the 10-99 form I wanted a professional to help. I should have been notified at that moment the cost increase for that form.</Text>

< Review>
Well the tax preparer did not seem to know what she was doing but she was nice. She seemed unsure of certain things and that made me uncomfortable, but I appreciate that she asked someone for help. Vicky was really sweet and professional, she was the highlight of my visit along with the manager who helped her with my payment. I really appreciated those two and if I do come back it will be because they put in the effort to make sure I left happy.< /Review>

Just a trim cost $15. Seems high to me. Haircut was fine. Nice atmosphere. Friendly staff. Little waiting time. By appointment or walk-in.< /text>

Ive been kneeling and praying to the porcelain gods since 7 am this morning after I ate the rest of my steak and cheese sandwich with onion, spinach, banna peppers and jalapenos. Either the stations arent being properly cleaned or the food has bacteria growing in it because holy heck ive not been this sick in a minute....

Food is good and quickly prepared. No problems so far. Atmosphere is a little chaotic with the television and radio going at full volume at the same time. Otherwise a good place to get a quick bite.</Text>

(Translated by Google) As it is open for 24 hours, it is very convenient.
Eating while you are doing laundry in the nearby laundry
I promise to drink coffee.
A salad is also recommended for takeaway.

24時間開いているので、とっても便利です。
すぐ側のランドリーで洗濯物をしている間に食べたり
コーヒーを飲むのがお約束。
持ち帰りにはサラダもお薦めです。< /Text>

A couple of our employees stopped in for lunch and the great plates of burgers and fries.  The food was so good we decided to put a food review on our blog.  If your close stop by and grab a burger you won't be disappointed.</Text>

ordered a 1/2 pound burger special and got a few ounce a beef instead. I got a bread burger. Patti was tiny, no where near a 1/2 pound. I just tossed it in the trash  once the woman confirmed that it was the correct order.  Rip off, better off going anywhere else.< /Review>

We like a lot hanging out. Yesterday we came to this delicious restaurant which friends recommended to us. We enjoyed a delightful experience there with exceptional meal and a nice stuff and a great chief cook. We put this venue in our phone list  and we shall no doubt go again soon.  Highly recommended.< /review>

I really like this resturant and to be honest it is overall very wholesome and has great hospitality. The food is always the same quality, and is very delicious every time. The dish is as seen in the pictures, and tastes as you would imagine. Quality service, food and happiness.< /review>

< Review>
Horrible experience ever.. the first thing that caught my eye was that it was completely empty.  The tables were dirty there was no napkin dispenser on tables or salt shakers the lady that was working had a bad attitude i asking for some napkins and she ignored me the burger that i ordered was ok not to die for. There are many burger places in carson and definitely wouldn't recommend this place. Bad service😡 omega Burgers was the best..< /Review>

First time here, I ordered the Colossal Burger Combo. The burger was good, grilled just right and topped with pastrami. The Fries was good. Clean inside the dining and the service was friendly.<//review>

I live near a ton of fast food restaurants and this place is small relaxing and has quality food. It’s somewhere I feel like I can relax while I eat a good. It’s been around forever and it never gets old.</text>

Absolutely the best burger grill in town. (It' Not a Fish Grill.) They will make anything Fresh on their menu/per order but just specify; Fresh or else you'll get an old batch.< /Review>

<Review>Philly cheesesteak sandwich veggies where still raw and the meat was precooked carne asada. Pastrami was dry and garlicky bread was not toasted or buttered. Jr. Burgers where dry. But its opened Christmas day.<//Review></record>

Fabulous Grill #2 formally known as Omega Burgers.

Did not do a good job in making my sandwhich, was an online order.  They did not add lettuce to my footlong and when I called to let them know the girl was rude and when I asked for the manager she said she would be there in the morning and "Good Luck Getting A Hold Of Her," in a rude way.  Will never go back again.</review>

Sandwiches are made with quality ingredients with on site oven baked breads. A good value for the price. Menu provides healthier choices for lunch or dinner.</Text>

<text>Absolutely terrible. There service has gone down so much it’s crazy. Went there for lunch with my boyfriend who used to work there and he was disgusted with how bad it has gotten and how rude the girl helping us was. We ate in the store and the meat in my boyfriend sandwich was ice cold. He asked for a new one and the girl got upset with him???? Just stay home if you’re going to have an attitude.< /text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

Typical subway. Nothing more. Nothing less. There is plenty of parking though. We usually go to this one because it is less busy than the other local subways.< /review>

I haven't been into a Subway in so long. I can't remember when.... But funny how this shows up, now... 😂

Stop making me crave at late hours... 😂

But the Meatball Marinara is the main reason I ever bother to go.

It's like lasagna in a bun.

Without having to bake it. 😂< /review>

Sandwiches are good but customer service could be a little better. Lunch time is crowed for sure and so is dinner time. If you want to skip the lines download the subway app and order from there. Never had any problems with the app or my order.</review>

Service is horrible u ask for something and they give what they want and then blame u for "not telling me u wanted it" I'm a subway customer and have never had issues until i stepped into this Fontana location (slover and sierra ave) ...if time allows u to go to another subway i suggest u go.<//Review>

<Text>The park has a big parking lot and a good amount of space for picnics. There's a skate park a good distance away from the kids play area. There's also two tennis courts and basketball courts here. I even enjoy taking a stroll through the whole park, it's very peaceful and the greenery helps calm my mind. It's close to a residential street so it's fairly safe except for the far end of the parking lot. But definitely recommend coming here.</Text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Great place for a run, a single lap on the path is .25 mile.  The 2 playgrounds are nice, they have a foam ground so it's not as dirty as most, and they have a little skate park
Ohh but the bathrooms don't have doors on their stalls so there's no privacy 😒<//Review><rating>4<//rating>< UserId.>

Rialto needs to touch up this skatepark a little. Someone defaced one of the ramps with puck you. It looks as though they used to have a nice cover to give some shade on the skatepark that no one has replaced. There's a shoe hanging on one of the lines to the non existent cover. Can't say the best of crowd hangs out here when you have elementary kids that frequent the park. Just wished it was cleaned up and maybe monitored.<//review>

This is a nice park with a lot of trees, grass, playground suited for older kids, basketball courts,  and tennis courts.  There is a skate park adjacent to the park and 99% of the time its just kids who want to skate,  every now and then you someone smoking pot close to the playground. I took off one star because there was a small playground for little kids that they removed and doesn't seem like they're planning on replacing itat this time.< /Text>

<review>This park is clean, it has a field for soccer, picnic, or whatever you choose to bring, and a softball field, it has a skate section for practicing tricks and light in that area, it has 2 gazebo section for gatherings or parties, 2 basketball courts, 2 tennis courts, 2 medium playgrounds, a medium walking trail and about 2-4 grills on the premises. Usually the people there are respectful and descent.</review>< pictures>

The bad-Too many people smoking marijuana at the tables and the skate park around kids (my son will be the first to pick up the skunk smell), the north end play ground is in need or repairs, the ground padding on the south playground  is coming apart. Tables are extremely dirty and internally rusting. Starting to see more graffiti.
The Good- Large park with lots of sport fields and parking.< /text>

It's like 3 parks in 1. When you pull up you can see the is my area for smaller children. Then further back is the play area for one for toddlers and bigger kids. Plus the slate park. My favorite park to take my kid.< /Review>

This park needs a remodel the sheltered areas are very dirty. The tables need to be redone, the playground turf needs to be completely redone instead of just patched.< /text>

Very nice spaceous family oriented park. Not over crowded. Plenty of space for the children to play and have a good  time.The only negative is the bathroom. They are nightmarisly dirty.< /text>

<Review>Fergusson Park to Kulim Park, via a scenic walkway along Tauranga Harbour is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours walking whilst in theTauranga area. Great views of Mount Maunganui all along the way, with its majestic 230m high volcanic cone, and of the Port of Tauranga. Lots of benches scattered here and there for a rest.<//Review><pics>None<//pics>< Resp>

Overall a nice neighborhood park.  It's well maintained most of the time; weekends get trashy due to the people there that don't pick up after themselves--Like many public facilities, I guess.  Our group walks mornings/evenings past this park; watch out for "rif-raf" that have nothing better to do than hang out--Again, like many public facilities.</Text>
