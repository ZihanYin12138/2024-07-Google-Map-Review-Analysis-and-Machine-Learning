<Text>I was in the area and saw this place on my map. It’s small but the employees here are great and do a very good job. The price is affordable especially since it’s all hand washed. The receptionist was nice and answered all my questions. This will be my new spot.<//Text>< Pictures>

< review>
Amazing and great place highly recommend, team does a great job very friendly, professional and very passionate to the the task given. I came in with a Honda Civic 2015(I did not take any before pics 😓) but i can describe so I just got the car, interior was disgusting smelled horrible like cigarettes and old mj  and somethin else (summer around the corner )  carpet had like gunk build up dirt build up one had like a baking soda looking stain. Pet hair, Dash board was  layered with dust like you can see the brown on it. Seats stained dirty. Oh and the soda holder and door handle was treated as an ash tray. The trunk was gross like old brown liquid in it where spare wheel was sandy dirty trunk. Now for the exterior Rims looked bland the exterior of the car looked bland dirty spotty.
Andres gave me options what he can offer not upselling me explained what he can do and went over about exterior, from simple wash, waxing, or ceramic to coat the car
I asked them to give me the top notch stuff make it new looking like if they were selling the car to me. So went with shampooing and detail clean inside car as well as ceramic I was quoted almost $300 I was completely ok with it. Since it was disgusting.

These guys really put in the work and it shows. I drop off the car 9am got it back at 5pm (reasonable since it was a really disgusting car and they needed to multitask with easy job cars, i did not mind)
I was super excited to see the car like new I gave them about  20% tip. Thats how happy I was. Exterior looks amazing like a mirror.
In a photo I add you can see a palm tree reflected. Oh and it smelled great.
I will be taking my other car here and use this place for deep cleaning for my cars.</review>

Buddie suggested place.

Location - Kinda hidden on Long Beach Blvd.

Venue - Place needs new sofas and to be cleaned up.

Service - Service is good other than that service is good, but the cleaners need to learn how to clean inside door jams, hatchbacks jams , real tailgate and more. I provided pictures.

Prices -  Fair for a 100% hands on car wash.

Overall place needs better cleaners but can do 100% if they focused on details.< /text>

<Review>I usually come here to get my car washed and they do a pretty good job.  However,  today, had to get up twice since these guys didn't know how to operate my vehicle! Seriously? As many cars that come through here and you can't figure out how to dislodge the emergency brake and then aren't able to open up the trunk?!!</Review><user>104310195890833348592</user>< date>

The best part it's that is only 10 dollars and the thing is that I wouldn't mind paying a little more for their services. They do a great job at cleaning the inside of your car too. They are also great at making sure that everything looks clean and even put tire armor at no additional cost. They have a big sitting area too. I always recommend this car wash to my friends when they are around the area.</review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

I suggest getting there at least 15 to 20 minutes before they open and get in line. Its a bright blue building that sits back from the street.</Text><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

Love this car wash. Might have to wait but it is the best all hand car wash in Long Beach. It is also the cheapest and includes armor all dressing on your tires. My SUV is 13.00, trucks are 14.00 and cars are 12.00. Cant beat tbose prices unless you wash it yourself. Andre is a very nice man who will jump hoops to fix your needs. 5 star all the way.< /Review>

For the low price of 11.00 for my truck, they do excellent work.  Better then me paying 20.00 and it's not done correctly so, I give the extra tips to them. Keep up the great work.  ♡♡♡<//Review>

AMAZING work! I had let my car get pretty dirty since I have a 50 mile commute round trip for work daily. These guys did miracles on my car. It came out great, everything so shiny. They went above and beyond expectations.... make sure to tip them well, they work hard. This place is popular so there's usually a short line but it's worth it,  if you get there before closing and you're in line they'll still take you.</Text>

< Review>
I go to get my car washed here when im too lazy to do it myself they are quick if you are getting just a hand wash & they clean the inside well for an affordable price. Takes quite a bit longer if you want other services especially if it's busy. Would recommend, but dont go when it's busy and expect not to wait.</Review>

<text>PROS: They don't slack off on cleaning the interior! My huge coffee stains in the back seat are GONE!!!!! The price is pretty affordable compared to other places.

CONS: The place is SO small that people line up with their cars for their turn sometimes. The line could get so long it might block the small street you enter.

TIP: Don't go during lunch. Best to show up right when they open if you want to save time.

The entrance is located on the small cross street of Long Beach Blvd. When the car is cleaned you exit onto the major seats.<//text><pics>None<//pics>< resp>

10/10 - this place is awesome, not too crowded and has a variety of tracks for all skill levels. Everyone we have encountered here has shown positive and inclusive attitude.< /Review>

Very nice park. Big dirt trail. Some people ignore the no motor bikes or remote control cars rule which sucks for the kids who have to wait for them to go away before it's safe for them to ride. Not fair to the kids of the community.< /Text>

Nice little paved track for kids, three other progressively larger, more challenging tracks with big jumps! Although when I first got there, I was a little worried...this is the thick of the iron triangle in Richmond. But everyone there was very nice, including a group racing rc cars. Happy to have found this in my area and will be back! Curious how we can support this local gem....</review>< Pictures>

<text>Cool little bike park, track is a little rough and could use some maintenance but solid lines to have some fun and progress, be aware lots of RC cars even though rules stated NO RC CARS. Over all pretty chill tho.< /text><name>Tracy< /name></record>

<Review>Its always a good time for me and my s7 year old son. Personally i think the people that make that happen there have the right idea. What i mean by that its we all know our kids are our future and the kid from our present need places like that to entertain themselfs to get involved in activities that bicycling basketball soprts instead of learning hiw to you know hussle people shoot people rob people from older men on the atreets of richmond or any other city for that matter which is the reason the bike park sure keep upgrading for kids from all corners of the city come to it.</Review></record></dataset><record>

Great experience everything explained well. But didn't except my state issued medical ID card where all my purchases are tax free. States in New law. I'm just confused. Jacob did well explaining it but what I read and what he said are 2 different animals. Hopefully someone can read into it a lil more. Great freebies, product, service and atmosphere.

Edit:  After further education and research Jacob and the crop were correct 15% tax still applies.

Edit: After further evaluation i was told by them no dispensaries in ca can dispense clones or seeds. This false. Thus the stars go down.  I dont want to drive 400 miles to get clones or seeds. They should be like any other dispensary and carry clones and seeds. Kern county sucks.< /text>

This place is so fabulous! The staff is really friendly and informative!  The guy in front really made me feel at ease and welcome! Joseph then took me in, like when you're at the doctor's office. He then explained so much to me! It was great because I don't have a clue about this stuff! He was very patient and calming. I would highly recommend this place!!</Review>

<review>Very friendly, very professional, wide variety of quality products, highly recommend!

By far The Crop is the best dispensary I've been to. They really take care of their customers and explain which products are the best for what your looking for. I live near other dispensaries that are a few minutes away, but I'd rather make the 30min drive to The Crop.</review><pics>None< /pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

The environment offers a since of security and a  very welcoming feel. Plenty of parking for all. Handicap accessable including wheelchair accessible parking and entrance. I was greeted with smiles and kindness. Their staff is extremely knowledgeable and was able to help me find the right products for me. They carry a wide variety of high quality products all at affordable prices. The Crop, unlike most shops of this nature, has taken an active role in our community participating in clean-up projects and much more. Keep up the good work and I'll see ya soon.</review>

The Crop is hands down my favorite dispensary in Bakersfield. From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, I felt as if it were someone's home. Everyone was very knowledgeable and extremely eager to answer all of my questions in a way that was easy to grasp. Not only was The Crop obviously taken care of aesthetically, but the people were professional as well. I didn't feel it was shady like other dispensaries I had been to in the past. They carry so many branded products, it was amazing. At first it was overwhelming, but they quickly gave me the rundown and narrowed things down for me according to my needs. The Crop is definitely my go-to dispensary from here on out!< /Review>

The most friendly, clean, well stocked, and knowledgeable location within this area/region by far! The location on the exterior may be misleading without your typical neon lights and large name displays, though once inside that is truly where the magic begins. From the non-extensive paper to the kind and curious doorman, the first time patient check was in my opinion flawless, non discriminatory, and professional.
Once inside not sure who may provide you service but the gentleman by the name of Joseph helped in assisting me with my visit. The quality, layout, and choice selection inside  this dispensary was immaculate, and that may be an under statement. I was not rushed or manipulated in any way when making my selections which is a huge relief when you're a bit of a stickler and/or very sensitive to your preferencesite.
Lastly i'd like to add that the pricing was the peak point ending my experience on an incredible high note. I would recommend this dispensary to both the young and older community of patients being that this location can easily accommodate any type of patient. Thank you "The Crop" and keep doing what you're doing.....Ashton....😊</Text>

<review>Took wife today who switched from nasty pharmaceutical drugs for ptsd, who has a hard time in new environments. The person who was working today made my wife  a first timer feel very welcomed and at ease and explained everything from the different  types of flowers to edibles. Took time to listen to her and helped her out to get flower for daytime and nightime use. Took her here after reading numerious good reviews for first timers feeling welcomed and the reviews were all correct. Amazing shop , tons of flowers to choose from and no nasty hard core rap playing thug enviroment like most other shop reviews had. Wife said this place was very professional and wished her doctor listened to her as good as this person did who was working today. Sorry to not give credit to the bud tenders name but we will just call him Dr. Green as the wife forgot his name. Definitely go here if your a first timer or looking for a good safe environment shop  with friendly knowledgable staff, ample easy parking and even a friendly doorman then seriously consider this place you wont be disappointed. This will be the only place we will go for medical flower. They just gained another loyal customer ....< /review><resp>None<//resp><time>1534474540042</time>< userid>

Casa Burger In Arvin Is 🔥🔥🔥🔥, DEFINITELY Worth The Drive From Bakersfield To Get Some Of Their Delicious Offerings!!! My Favorites Are The Shrimp Or Fish Basket Or Dinner Combinations, Onion Rings And Fries!!! (Everything On The Menu Is Good Tho) The Drinks With Crushed Ice Are OH SO Good Too!!! Thank You Casa Burger In Arvin For Your Awesome Service And Hot Food Made To Order 👍👍</Text>

I meant to take a picture of my food but I couldn't stop eating it.if you're within 30 miles of this place driving through, it's a must stop. Staff is ultra friendly the food is amazing. They will custom make anything they have. Had a single with pastrami and bacon. It was fantastic!</Text>

Always a good experience eating here, there food is some of the best in town no doubt. I'd give it 5 stars if the food was a little cheaper. But you do get what you pay for. Quality!<//text>

I really enjoy the burgers they are so good i always get the number 3 the tripple texas burger yeah its a big burger but for only $9.00 you get a big burger some small fries and a small drink i say its worth it. I recomend you give casa burger a try because you will enjoy their food. 💯💯💯< /Review>

I love this spot.  Been coming since before my teens. Lots of memories of this place and the burger joint that used to operate across the street. Good burgers, love the dipped soft serve cones and always have fun spending a few quarters in the arcade games.< /Text>

By far one of the best sushi I have had in Southern California — at the same level of Nobu and Asanebo. Fresh fish that melts in your mouth and extremely creative dishes. The service is also attentive and friendly. A great experience!< /review>

Amazing food, tonight we had Yoshi chef and there are no words to describe his creativity and experience. We love coming here because they always make us feel like we are home. Fantastic service.

The man, the myth, the legend! He is always teaching his staff new good stuff! The man knows how to treat his guests and will always give you the best of the best! Second time visiting, his son, Kohei, killed it! Seriously enjoyed the art he created and the conversation! Probably the gold standard for all of my sushi from here!< /Review>

Fantastic place we have been going for years. The chefs are all talented and will make custom orders to your needs, which is great as someone who eats kosher. I have been to Michelin starred sushi in Japan and this is the same quality. Price is as expected for high quality, authentic sushi in an upscale mall. 10000% recommend!<//Text>

If you are  asking where can I get some delicious Ankimo in Orange County, Hamamori Restaurant and Sushi Bar at South Coast Plaza serves some of the freshest fish, including Ankimo, in the county! Hamamori's sushi are always meticulously prepared and tastefully presented. Other than sea dishes, they also serve some melts-in-your-mouth-because-its-so-buttery wagyu steak. Very mouth watering! The staff was very professional and knowledgeable of their menu. Their menu is also pretty extensive so there's definitely a dish for everyone's taste buds! Truly a great fine dining and intimate experience!< /Text>

I arrive at this special restaurant once a month since I love the ambiance that is unique to this place. The crew is extraordianrillyremarkably friendly and experienced. The service is deeply fast. Not to mention, the food they cook is perfect. I visited many times and I was never disappointed. The payment is modest. I highly suggest this place to my friends and family.</Review>

James Hamamori is supremely talented both in balanced, modern sushi creation, and in cooked dishes from pork belly through tempura. I lived a couple years in Japan, and have enjoyed sushi up and down California and elsewhere. Outside of Tsukiji and Hokkaido, I haven't found better quality fish, and I haven't found better skills anywhere. Staff and chefs are friendly. Of course the omakase is excellent, but so is everything else, and your personal preferences are welcomed.< /Text>

<text>The sushi was very good. We had told the chefs to make us their own specialties and tried about 8 different courses. Each course had unique fish accompanied with various spices and flavors. The one odd thing was that the chopsticks were the cheap wooden ones vs. the nice ceramic. I was surprised at this, given how nice of a restaurant it is.<//text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<text>My sister talked about this place few times so I  finally visited. It's not a big place so I almost passed by this place.
I loved their salmon nigiri from their sushi menu. The  combination of rice and fish was just right.  They also have happy hour menu. I tried their mixed tempura which wasn't covered with too much batter and not too greasy. I also liked their tofu salad. Make sure to eat with the sauce. It was very refreshing.< /text><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

The food here is phenomenal. They elevate each plate to a new level of delicious. The restaurant is expensive, but we'll worth the price. It is an especially nice place to celebrate a significant even. I'll definitely be back.</Text>

<Review>It's been ages since I've gone out for omakase it seems. However, my friend Kurt hit me up to try a new spot. Such great timing! In addition to that, a recent article from OC Weekly came out listing the top 10 sushi spots, so this dinner was destined to happen one way or another. As we went back and forth on the prime meet up spot, we settled on Hamamori for its convenience and the fact that neither of us have been.

Arrived on location at 6p to a slow evening, but it was nice to have the bar to ourselves. As we reviewed the menu, we started the evening with a taste of sake since we were indecisive on which to choose from. We sampled a choice of sweet or dry and settled on the dry to pair with our meal. To go with the ambiance, each pour is served in a champagne flute instead of the usual you see, so it sets the tone for a fancy meal ahead, in which I was eager to taste.

We inquired about omakase and the chef began the meal. With each plating, we were served two pieces at a time. The opening sequence was albacore with crispy onions and golden eye snapper. The chef made it a note to request no soy sauce as each was seasoned individually and made to complement the fish.

We totaled at 18 pieces:
Sea bream and Blackthroat Seaperch.
Wagyu Beef/Foie Gras and Lobster/Miso
Salmon/Pineapple and Sweet Live Shrimp/Caviar/Lemon Zest
Halibut/Foie Gras and King Scallop
Bluefin Tuna/Bleu Cheese/Seaweed Sauce and Seared Yellowtail/Jalapeno
O Toro and Shima Aji
Eel/Foie Gras/Orange Zest
Halibut Tempura Handroll
Sea Urchin and Yellowtail

To conclude, the meal was spectacular and just what I was craving for. I could go for a little less foie gras since I'm not superbly wow'd by it, but it did complement most of the pairings that evening. However, I'm just a bit skeptical on pricing since I feel I could get something on par for a third of the price less. Still, it was a great meal nonetheless and I would return for a fancy meal every once in awhile, but it's not my go-to sushi fix.< /Review><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<Time>1526785802061< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Text>We went into the restaurant and it didn't even take a long time for us to notice that the servers obviously very attentive to the "white" customers. When they came to our table the attitude was completely different. Not to mention the foods are totally overrated with unreasonable pricing. There are way more better restaurants you can go instead of this one. Apparently their service training is inconsistent as well as the foods. The nigiri sushi we ordered was incredibly pathetic with extremely thin fish on it (and it’s not even fresh). Moreover, they put the price on the menu but intentionally put price may vary at very sneaky Insignificant corner with very ambitious description. So we ended up being charged way more than the pricing on the menu. What a great honest restaurant. That even makes me concern about their overall quality control procedure including foods and employees. I'll never come back to this restaurant and think twice if you wanna come here.<//Text>< Pictures>

Top notch nigiri! Tried this place after eating at Nobu Malibu a couple days prior, and there’s no comparison. Hamamori blows it out the water at a much more reasonable price.<//text>

<Review>Nice place you can enjoy the open air feeling, but you definitely pay extra for the location. Udon soup was okay but nothing special. Sushi fish was fresh. Grilled octopus was very small for the price.  Bowls dishes were mostly rice. Go for sushi and avoid the over priced salads and other dishes.<//Review>< Resp>

<review>I am disappointed in the food quality and pricing at this restaurant. First, items in the menu were priced differently on our check, we were not notified. The service was poor, long wait times even though the restaurant was not busy and inattentive servers catering to a "certain" clientele. Moreover, the price and quality is mismatched, the food is okay, edible but DEFINITELY NOT worth the price you pay. This is like eating sushi at a grocery store, why would I pay that much for this!? The tempura is a disappointment, don't get it. Soba doesn't taste fresh at all, waste of money and calories. Don't come here, queue up for Din Tai Fung if you want to eat well at the mall and go find any other great sushi place in LA.</review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><resp>None</resp>< Gmap_id>

This place specializes in Sushi Gems... and they're amazing. I can't say I've ever had a sushi roll at this place because the gems are that good. The only con is that each gem is pricey and you'll have a hard time not ordering more. Expect a sizable bill.< /review>

<Review>Might be my favorite place for sushi and sashimi. The fish are always fresh and delicious. Whether you want authentic or westernized Japanese food this is definitely the place to go.< /Review><Pics>None</Pics>< response>

<Rating>5< /Rating><Review>Hamamori's is one of the finest and most creative sushi bars have had the pleasure to enjoy.  I have been to many, many sushi bars over the last 30 years, both here and abroad, and I consider this to be one of the very best.  Impeccable quality combined with skill and artistry to provide an unforgetable meal.  The more you allow the chefs an opportunity to be creative by avoiding to dictate presentations, the more you will be surprised by the results.< /Review>< pictures>

San Diego, inexpensive dinner and/or drinks cruise on Mission Bay.  Always lots a fun for a short round trip cruise.  Very friendly staff.  Boats are getting a bit older but still very nice.  Indoor seating for chilly nights or outdoor, top deck seating is a great option. First come, first serve.  Have to get there early, but nice hanging out at the bay.  Line getting on moves quickly.  Always a good size crowd, especially because a few hotels give free vouchers like the catamaran.  Worth the time when down by Mission Bay.< /review>

Actually a pretty decent experience until I had to throw away the Shirley Temple drinks I bought for my 3 year old and 6 year old to get off the boat.  I can understand not taking alcoholic beverages off the boat, but really I couldn't keep my kids drinks that cost more than the ride itself? Shameful.  You should explain to my kids why they can't enjoy their Shirley Temples.<//review>

While waiting for the cruise, it is nice to relax on the cabana lounge chairs on the beach. No reservation needed, first come first serve.

For hotel guest, the ride is FREE.

The Service: So so.... the cruise leaves every hour, you can stay as long as you want. Unfortunately, many passengers love it so much and they wouldn't get off the cruise. At the end, they could not board the passengers waiting at the pier (they have specific capacity). We had to wait for one more hour & pray that there would have enough room for us..... :(

The Bar: Limited choices of cocktail.

The first level of the cruise is not open. The second level of the cruise is the bar & dance floor. Very small dance floor.... super crowded. They put chairs on two sides of the dance floor. Good music, however, no room to dance. The third level of the cruise is the open deck. 9 benches for seating. It is also the "smoking area".

It is about 45 minutes of ride. Unfortunately, not much to see at the Mission Bay.<//text>

<Review>Under rated fun. If you have 1.5 hours to kill, take the Belle for 3 trips (to, back and to your destination). Have a drink on the roof while taking in beautiful mission bay or dance with the DJ below. Overall, a great, slow way to get to/from PB & Mission Beach.</Review><pics>None</pics>< response>

<text>Sadly, the Captain of the vessel was distracted and we hit an iceberg. The ship went down quickly so as we couldn't get many of the lifeboats off in time. 57 souls lost in the icy cold, briny depths - fortunately I was one of the few suvivors. We have a memorial service every year on open seas of Mission Bay and toss empty beer cans out where the BB tragically sank!< /text>< gmapID>

Something to do that's always enjoyable. It can even be used as a water taxi that sells booze to get from Mission Beach to Pacific Beach.<//review>

It's kinda small but it was the most informative of the 2 we visited in the park. It's more of an art gallery with a small gift shop.<//Text>

Appeared to me to be an old time eastern style resort that doesn't really fit in with the surroundings.  The golf course is really out of place.</Text>

What I expect from a visitor center is that if I go to a new (or even old) place and I have questions about planning my trip or stay, I expect to get some answers from the visitor center. I would also expect them to have up to date maps and information on how to get around. But this visitor center albeit having decent number of employees, isn't really doing anything except distributing maps and shuttle schedules (not to mention even those schedules are out of date).<//Text>

<Time>1468446429911<//Time><Rate>5< /Rate><Text>(Translated by Google) Wawona, located at the southern entrance to Yosemite, was originally an Indian settlement. In 1865, Galen Clark built a Clark Station in the name of his own name, and visitors to the Yosemite Valley could spend the night here. In 1864, the Mariposa Grove, consisting of the Yosemite Valley and the huge redwoods, was officially protected by the Yosemite Grant. Clark was nominated as the first director of Yosemite (guardian). In 1875, the Wawona Highway was opened to traffic, and the Washburn brothers acquired the land. They built the Wawona Lodge and are still open until now.
In Wawona, visitors can learn about the development of Yosemite and the people involved. Showcase historic pioneering houses and carriages at the Pioneer Yosemite History Center

位于约塞米蒂南方入口处的瓦沃纳，原本是印地安聚落。1865年，伽林·克拉克(Galen Clark) 以自己名字为名在此地建了旅馆(Clark Station)，来到约塞米蒂山谷的游客便可在此过夜。1864年，约塞米蒂山谷和巨大红杉组成的玛利波萨森林(Mariposa Grove)正式受到约塞米蒂捐赠地法案(Yosemite Grant)的保护。克拉克被提名为约塞米蒂的首位主任(guardian)。1875年，瓦沃纳公路开始通车，沃什柏恩兄弟(Washburn brothers)取得这片土地，他们盖了瓦沃纳旅馆，直到现在仍在营业。
在瓦沃纳，游客可以了解到约塞米蒂的发展过程和参与其中的人物。在约塞米蒂先驱历史中心(Pioneer Yosemite History Center)，展示具有历史特色的拓荒时代房舍和马车<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Response>

Kong's Pet & Grooming Salon is amazing! They opened early for my mother, and as she had her chihuahua groomed, they were able to coordinate special dog treats and a last minute dog Birthday Cake for my pugs 1st birthday! It was so special and so appreciated! Would recommend them to anyone in the area!</Text>

Its been about 3 months since i got them groomed so it was time. I called about 6 groomers the day before i arrived in Vernon, California and none of them had any time or openings for my dogs.
I called Kong's and the gentleman on the phone was very nice and said "no problem" bring them in Sunday morning. I did, he got both my dogs washed and groomed within an hour and a half. They look awesome! Thanks you all! If im back in the area again, your my place of choice.< /Review>< Pictures>

Good experience.
Mr. Kong appeared to be a nice guy, the girl who trimmed our cat's nails was good at her job, and his price was the best that I found.< /review>

The manager or owner what ever he is was very nice. He was a no bull straight to the point type of guy and we like that. My dogs got exactly what they need it. Washed and nailed trim and something for their glands. It's been three days now and my dogs still smell and feel clean. I will be going back on March for my dogs teeth cleaning which is 150 dollars cheaper than my regular place.< /text>

The staff at Kong's Pets & Grooming are super friendly.  They treat my yorkie-chihuhua with so much love as if it were their own.  They do an outstanding job at getting my little one looking at her best and smelling great.  They also have a great variety of pet clothing, accessories, food and supplies to meet your needs.<//Text>

I originally heard of this place from a family member.
I had worries about my dog that because he is a pit. Most groomer treat him like a hazard Kong treated him like FAMILY
I originally took my dog in because of the summer fleas are known to be out more and I wanted to protect him but I also wanted something for the bottom of my dogs paws because they were cracking.
The staff was very friendly and let me know the products that I could use to help with that.
I then decided to take my dog for a bath... they left my puppy like new!!!!
The bottom of his paws were very smooth he had no fleas and his fur was so soft and he was no longer shedding BUT what I liked most was that he smelled and felt great
while my dog was taking his bath I looked around and saw a lot of cute accessories for pets I ended up leaving with a new dog tag it was very cute it was shaped like a fire hydrant and was even red the tag was done in 2 mins
I loved that after the bath we were made to feel like he we were long time customers they gave my dog treats
all this for a low cost I would really recommend this place
I will never go back to petco in my life
A tag in petco is 16 dollars at kongs it was 6 and it was nicer< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><response>None< /response><GmapID>0x80c2cebf68886d37:0x89fe4b875bf0455a<//GmapID></record>

Their pizzas are REALLY good. This is my go to when it comes to pizzas. When I order in person everyone is nice and I get my order pretty fast considering it has to go through the oven. My only issue is when I order through UberEats, for some reason they haven't gotten that right. MULTIPLE times I've gotten part of my order wrong, sometimes after I place an order through the app I will call the store to double check that my order is going to be right. It never is. Sometimes I'll even purchase something extra and ask for it to be replaced for the item I really want, and I'm paying A LOT of money, and they ignore it. It has gotten to the point where if I'm hungry and crave pizza, I just think of the unnecessary hassle they make me go through and I don't want pizza anymore.</Text>

<user_name>Lorena Hernandez</user_name><time>1614629908012< /time><review>The pizza it's super good and also the waiting time it's not bad. But on Saturday I order over the phone a large pizza half pepperoni and half Hawaiian they gave me the total of $10.75 and when I pick it up they charged me a little over $13 I didn't ask because that's about what I have paid in other places. The thing that the pizza was for a little party for my daughter and when I open the box was only Hawaiian🤦🤦🤦 I called the store and they told me that I should of go and returned and I told her "I just told you it was for a party and I was already home" and all what she told me was well sorry next time bring it back and I was no next time I will check my order because I'm not going to trust that you giving me what I order😒😒😒😒<//review>< response>

<Review>The food is good. The employees that I have encountered do not appear to be educated in customer service. It appears as if they do not want to be there working.  The Tumby's on Figueroa and Manchester or the one on Western between Manchester and Florence display way more customer service and are way more inviting.</Review>< pics>

<Review>Place made me got get money from ATM because a "policy" if you don't carry an ID you can't use a debit card??? Come on the bank doesn't even ask for my ID. The pizza was made with low quality ingredients because it gave bad stomach habits to both me and my buddy. Really bad service to be honest.<//Review><UserId.>112170520851705378505<//UserId.>< gmapID>

This was without a doubt among the less appetising pizza we have had. When we first got it home we tasted it and thought it was not the greatest pizza we had had but it was ok. That opinion changed very quickly. Each bite we took was even more tasteless. To give you an idea, my 14 year old son who can easily plow through half a large pizza in one sitting, had two slices and wouldn't have any more. Their chicken wings were equally tasteless. Not going there again if they close every pizza joint in the city. If I could give it zero stars I would.< /Text>

I’m not by any means mechanically inclined,Amber had great knowledge on my situation of a cracked fuel line (impressed) , I followed her through the store and gathered the parts needed to do the job! Thank God for Amber, she is polite,incredible knowledge with a great personality!! At first I said to myself Oh NO a girl behind the counter, Wow I was wrong! I’ve owned several sports Bars for over 35+ years and you don’t find to many ladies of this caliber ! I can imagine most customers coming in are not the happiest but I’m sure when they leave they have a smile on their face ! There not many employees left out there that have the drive & personality - care about the customers situation! Again I very seldom give compliments, it is with great pleasure to let you know about Amber!<//text>< pictures>

Travis and Will are great people to work with and know how to get you the correct parts. After dealing with that joke in alpine it was nice to work with professionals and pay a fair price for the parts I needed. Thanks again Travis and Will, it was a pleasure doing business with you!</Text>

Just bought two parts at $45 each for a piece of equipment.  After I installed them, I thought to look up the part number on their website.  $27.95 each.  i'll tell myself once more-NEVER AGAIN!</text>< Pictures>

Stopped in to get oil filter they didn't have it said they could order it and have it in two days.  Guy was kind of rude so they lost a star went to the other Napa and got it same company different location. Big selection easy to get in and out of parking lot.</Review>

I've been here 2 times and both times they mark up the parts way over retail. Jerks! Dont go here ever! Better off ordering what you need online so they cant rip you off by over charging you.< /text>

Wow! A nice big store that looks like it must have everything, just like in the good old days! When you had to replace spark plugs every year! Ok that part wasn't so good, but back then there were well-stocked parts places everywhere.< /review>

All I wanted was to buy a funnel and leave.  The cute tattooed girl behind the counter was too bust "chatting" with the previous customer  to allow me to pay for my purchase.  After standing there for several minutes, I gad to butt in and ASK to pay fir my funnel.  Unprofessional, won't be going back.<//text>

Dirty. Full of dirt.  Joe Dirté you say? This ain't no garden, but me pup digs it.  Our go to spot.  Large and spacious.  Plenty of room for the younglings to run while the more aged dogs mosey around.  Check it out.  If I were you, which I'm not, but if was, I would have already. Which I did.  Life's a garden, dig it.</Text>

Great spot to take your pup/s to socialize and run themselves ragged. Lovely walking path there too if your fur baby is not so socially inclined.<//review>

<text>What I like is: there is parking all around the park everyone's energy is positive, the trial cover 2.2 miles wish I don't feel it. Beautiful view all around. Take time to go there and you will be surprised when you come back and come back. Good luck guys and God bless.<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

< Review>
Good park for sure no complaints. Ok it's pretty dusty no grass but there is plenty of water and the dogs and people are happy. There is enough seating in the shade i just came at the hottest time of day. So i need to
come back in the early or late hours to have a more comfortable experience because I'm sensitive to heat and so it my dog because is pretty much all black and so she heats up fast.</Review>

Love that they separate small dogs from the big ones. The small ones are pretty mellow. Lots of tennis balls around to play. Then you can take a nice walk around the lake.< /text>

< Review>
It’s a nice open place for off leash dog play time if your local to the area. However it loses points for its lack of maintained landscaping and the sometimes overwhelming number of dogs and people that fill the park. It’s better than nothing but I will make the drive to other LA area parks when possible for the aforementioned reasons.

I recommend aiming to visit outside of peak usage hours, weekend mid mornings and weekday early evenings.

Park is posted with a 10pm closed time however I’ve never found park officials enforcing this nor are any of the gate entrances ever being locked.<//Review>

We love grabbing ice cream at bi-rite close by every Sunday and chilling in dolores park. The vibe is great and on most days when the weather is good, a great place for friends to chill and enjoy the city view. We've tried almost all parks in the city, but this remains our favorite!</review>

One of the best spots to relax, enjoy company, and see a great view. I've been here at least 5 times, everytime I come to Los Angeles, CA. Definitely gets busy during the day and by night, the view of the city is just amazing. Since I've been back, they've added a tennis and basketball court. Definitely a go to spot.<//review>

<review>It's a great place to go if you're looking for a different place to go to with your kids (the under-5 set), but I wouldn't count on coming here more than once every month or so. It gets old and we have only been there 3 times altogether! The rides are defninitely "classic" (which means safety is my concern pretty much every second they take part in any rides) and the decor is "vintage" (read: old). It's pretty much in the same condition as from before I was born.< /review><time>1598426479948< /time></record>

Just ok for me. Super dusty park. Crowded at peak hours. Landscaping maintenance appears to be little or none. Lots of 'absent' owners on their phones and not paying as much attention to their dogs. A lot of aggressive dog behavior that needs taming. Much prefer Griffith dog park, Rosie's beach and even little Glen Alla dog park in MdR to this dust bowl.< /text>

<review>This was our dog's first dog park experience and it was amazing. He did well socializing with the other dogs and most of the owners were super friendly. It is separated from large and small dogs, however when we went, the small one was closed so it was large and small together. It went well for the most part and believe it or not, the small dogs were picking the fights, but most owners were watchful of their pups. I would definitely bring my dog here again since it was large and clean.<//review>< pics>

Love this place. Your little ones will be mesmerized. Many sights to explore. Perfect blend of rides, shows, and places to check out (with nursery rhythm themes). This place is much more relaxed and personalized for little ones in comparison to Silver Lake Dog Park.< /Review>

Not the greatest Dog park, probably worth the drive to go to either Highland park or the Griffith park dog park if you've got the time. Lots of aggressive dogs here and even though it is quite large it often feels overly crowded. Lots of owners not paying attention to their dogs, lots of un-neutered dogs. I've seen huge dog fights here because people bring dogs in heat or just aggressive, untrained dogs. Its usually super dusty and muddy and we always have to bathe our dog after coming here. Unfortunately its the closest one to us so we go somewhat often, but when time allows we always go elsewhere.</text>

<text>The Silver Lake dog park is a must stop for all dog owners. They have two parks, the big dog space (which is HUGE!) and the adjacent "little dog" park. Both spots are wonderful places to take your canine buddy to romp and socialize with other dogs. If you haven't been, put it on your must visit list. Your four legged friend will thank you for it!<//text><UserId.>106660613153718113702<//UserId.>< user_name>

Love this park!! A lot of the dogs are super friendly here and there's plenty of space for everyone to run around. A nice covered space with benches makes it comfortable for people and dogs to chill out on hot days.<//Review>

Parking is pretty much along the neighborhood streets bordering the park. There's a big dog side and little dog side, tons of dogs, and water fountains on both sides so your pup can always drink. There's some shaded tables, plenty of tennis balls to play fetch, and it's large! Only downside if you have a white long haired dog like us is that the park is mostly dirt, so your dog may need a bath after playtime here!< /review>

It's alright. It's great they have a small and big dog sections to separate the animals. People are friendly but there could be more amenities for the pups to play/use.< /text>

On the plus side, they have a designated small dog side that is separate from the big dog side. There is an easily accessible watering area. They have desiganted entrance and exit gates that are double gated so that dogs are less likely to escape.
The people who hang out at this park are awesome. Fun loving, good spirited, dog people. They not only enjoy the company of dogs, but the humans who accompany them also. Introduce yourself, have a great conversation, and watch your dogs play together.
There are a few nice seating areas. A couple of fixed picnic benches, a bench, and some plastic chairs you can move around.
Stuff that's good to know for you and your dogs..
There is not much shade, so if you're visiting on a hot, sunny day, bring a hat and some sunscreen.
There is not much grass, so it cn be dusty on a windy day. Bring the puppy wipes to keep your car free of dusty dog paw prints.
If you're driving to the park, parking can be tough. Be prepared to loop a couple of times to find a spot. If you're bringing an older dog, there are hills on the walk to the park thy may be difficult for those with hip and or knee problems.</Review>

I like how they have a small and big dog area! My dog is a little anxious but he opened up to the new dogs and had a grand time. A dog fight broke out though which concerned me but it was broken up kinda quickly.<//text>

Very good dog park!! Depending on the season though there will be a huge swarm of gnats/ bugs that follows you. I went in october and the bugs literally followed me around the park even after moving several times. Other people were affected as well< /Text>

Great neighborhood dog park. Sure the dirt isn't the best when your dog rolls around in it but there's always nice people and social dogs and there's enough shade so you won't overheat<//Review>

Good place to take your dog(s), There are two enclosed areas (small pups and big pups), shade, water (for the dogs), and some leftover tennis balls that dogs occasionally chew on.</Text>

I go to this dog park quite often due to my current job. I work for Affordable Animal Hospital of Los Angeles. I'm usually here during work hours. I enjoy each time I visit. Its a great park to bring your pets and let them roam around and enjoy themselves.< /Text>

Very large sandlot partly on a low-grade hill.  I've seen very few bad dogs here and it feels like there is enough space for many small groups of dogs to do their doggy thing. While you can find a spot in the shade to sit, there is not much protected play area for your pooches.</review>

He would run around nipping the big dogs ankles than sprint away and usually the big dog would eventually catch up to dizzy and the big dog would run over the smaller weiner dog which made dizzy tumble and roll which was the funniest thing he looked like a hot dog getting thrown down a grassy hill. That is to say he found that to be really fun so thats what he would do and we would laugh and he would make friends and thats just a personal story about my old dog dizzy RIP love the little guy and i wanted people to know that this dogpark is the best in the country im pretty sure i love the place.<//text><pics>None<//pics><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2c73a85395555:0xb91204e70deda751</gmapID></record></dataset><record>

<Review>Its a dog park in Silverlake, whatever imagine you have now in your head is correct. Its large, open area where dogs run around being dogs. If you are wondering about poop, they're dogs, in a confined space, there is poop, not a lot. If you have any other questions, just stop and think, is this a Dog Park in Silverlake? And all your questions should be answered.< /Review><gmapID>0x80c2c73a85395555:0xb91204e70deda751<//gmapID>< pictures>

Lots of dogs, most are pretty well socialized, and it's right next to the Silver lake reservoir so I usually take my dog for a run and bring her here after. The only downsides are that it can get quite dusty and since she's a puppy, sometimes its difficult to play with the adult dogs but we usually manage<//Text>
