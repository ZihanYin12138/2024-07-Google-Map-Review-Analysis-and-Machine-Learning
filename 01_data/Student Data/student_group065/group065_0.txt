<Review>The price is decent and the restaurant is located in front of a badminton gym. I like that it's out of the way but the food is only decent. It hits the spot but not sure if they could survive in a much more competitive neighborhood.</Review><pics>None<//pics><Resp>None<//Resp>< Gmap_id>

<response>None<//response><text>Little disclaimer before we start: I'm Indonesian, came in a group of 5 (all Indos), 2 have roots from Kalimantan/Borneo, one of which is from Singkawang and the other from Pontianak (not far from Singkawang). I must emphasize, This Is The Bomb.

Main dishes we got:
- Bakmi Singkawang: literally my favorite bowl of noodles in the entire LA county, like seriously. The texture and the flavor is just so on point, it puts other Indonesian noodle shops to shame (*cough* West Covina). To be fair, it doesn't have the same taste as your average noodles because it does have a slight vinegar taste, but that complements the flavors this dish has to offer. Like usually I'm the type of person to drown my noods in soup (don't @ me) but this? Heck no, the flavors are just too perfect that it shines, even without the soup 10/10
- Kwetiau Goreng Singkawang: solid dish, the kwetiau has a mild wok flavor, and the toppings are just seasoned perfectly to complement those noodles. I'm personally not a kwetiau girl, would probably have chosen the mie goreng instead but it's okay because this is still fire.
- Sup Sayur Asin: we didn't order this soup but it came with two of our dishes mentioned above (I think). But, I kid you not, this is the best sayur asin I've had in a long long time, probably better than most I've had in Indo. It has a bit of pork pieces in the bottom and the veggies in it aren't smelly at all (it's common for the veggie to be smelly). Honestly I would come back just for this soup ngl
- Nasi Campur: it came with the thick clear gravy sauce (not sure what it's called) but if it doesn't, just ask for it. I loved this one but I think it's missing something, maybe the broth isn't salty enough? Maybe the rice wasn't soft enough? I'm not even sure. For those wondering: the pork belly was super fat (which I love) but I know not everyone is super into that.
- Nasi Capcai: super nostalgic because it tastes exactly like what I used to eat; the veggies are still a bit crunchy which I know some people prefer. Definitely one of the healthier options or if you want to eat more veggies.

Appetizers & Others:
- Hakong: 8/10 without the sauce, 10/10 with the sauce. Bruh. That sauce is magic I swear. It complements the hakong so well with some balanced sweetness, sourness, and savoriness. Without it, it needs just a touch more salt but I think it's meant to be eaten with the sauce, so I'm not complaining haha.
- Choi pan: according to my friends, these are not singkawang style, but it's super delicious nonetheless. The sauce is the one that came with our kwetiau but it's delicious and spicy, but not as watery as the one I'm used too. The filling itself is super flavorful (with quite a good amount of white pepper), the wrapper is kinda chewy/bouncy in a good way--and is not too thick.
- Es doger: omfg they have ketan singkong and kolang kaling in it!! They had some interesting stuffs in it like popping boba and lychee jelly I think but I don't really mind it lol. The drink part is not overwhelmingly sweet, just the right amount for this dessert (I'm sure they use Marjan syrup)
- Sambal terasi: if yall need more spicy, do ask for this. You're welcome.

General situation:
Came when LA had outdoor dining open, but not indoor (3/13). I heard they're going to have both indoor and outdoor next week. Their outdoor seating is a spacious patio with some heater to keep you warm. The owners and workers are all Indonesian, with the owners originally from Singkawang. I know they serve Thai food but we didn't really ask why nor try it. All of the utensils and plates were single use (paper plates to serve the food, styrofoam plates for us to share), except for the bowls used for the noodles and soups where they used legit noodle bowls.

TL;DR: they have awesome Indonesian food that everyone must try. If you think Borneo Kalimantan Cuisine is good, try this one and you'll be blown away. 10/10 would come back and bring my Indo and non-Indo friends and families here!!<//text></record>

I visit the restaurant because they advertised one of their menu that hard to get in my area which is Choi Pan but after I tried it, I am very disappointed.
Then I order Bakso Singkawang and it is good.
I will give more try to this restaurant< /Text>

Ambiance is good, food is good, price is good for the Indonesian food size (note: Indonesian food size is smaller than average American food size), parking was not an issue during dinner time, restaurant name was clearly visible from the street when I came after dark for dinner, customer service is great. I ordered Soto Betawi. It had a lot of meat--very fulfilling and tasty, almost like the one I tasted in Indonesia. They gave red bean dessert, which is a plus for Asian restaurant. I had a great experience.</Review>

<Review>One of the few Indo-Thai restaurant in the area; honestly it's more of a resto vibe than a cafe. We came over dinner and ordered the mini-lumpia (10pcs) rolls and Pad Thai veggie. Food was tasteful and flavorful. However, during the course of our meal we saw a tiny black hair strand on the the pad Thai. Hence, we didn't finish the food. I'm sure its an isolated case but deeply disappointed nevertheless. On the positive side, their service was moderately fast. Prices are fair. Menu is somewhat limited from main Entree (e.g., No Nasi Rendang) to Appetizer. Staff were attentive, amiable and professional. Ample of parking spot. Overall, I will give it a try again and hopefully they will rectify the unsanitary issue.<//Review>< Pictures>

If you are thinking about ordering takeout from Singkawang Cafe (they offer delivery via Uber Eats), my suggestion is to avoid this option. Actually, considering their rudeness and disregard for customer service, my suggestion would be to find an alternative location. Singkawang Cafe messed up an order of 6 items from Uber Eats, preparing only half the items ordered (total of 3/6 prepared). That's okay, people make mistakes. When I called, they said that they messed up the order, and apologized, they could clearly see the order chit which had six items on it. I was upset at this point because my wife and children were hungry and we had half of our order ready. But the icing on the cake was when we spoke to the restaurant management in person, they changed their story saying that it was Uber Eats that made the mistake, only sending half the order to them. It is this dishonesty that made me write this review. Mistakes made, yes, it happens. Lying about it to the customer to cover your mistakes, that's another story. All we asked for was for the restaurant to cover the delivery charge since we had to go pick up the order ourselves (we even told them restaurant credit would be fine), and we were refused. I've ordered from this restaurant several times previously, but this time would be our last. Very disappointing.</text>

I wish this place existed when I was still going to high school in this area. I didn't try any of the Thai food bc that's much easier to come by, but it's cool knowing of a place I can take friends where there's a bit of variety.< /Text>

Mostly a thai food place. I was surprised at the quality of the pad thai and padsee ew(good). The curries were nice. Pretty good and not too bad for their prices. ~$10 a plate. Portions are average sized.</text>

George is owner of El Matador the "Carnitas Man" is the best Carnitas Chef this side of the border. There's secrets when it comes to boiling pork meat in pork fat ...and George uses the traditional methods. I usaually ask for a couple pounds without other delicacies (skin, belly :) couple pounds of really succulent Carnitas. ready for tacos or a torta, comes with really yummy exclusive red salsa. Enjoy!!!< /text>

I had previously re financed with North American. They actually reached out to me to offer me a lower rate and lower my payment. It was very easy to do everything online and complete the process. To close they will send someone to your house to sign the documents.
Thanks again for a great service.< /Review>

<text>I feel very fortunate to have Jessica Cao as my loan officer. In addition to being very helpful and supportive, Jessica went above and beyond to help me get the best loan. Jessica was extremely responsive and always answered any questions I had within a very short time frame. She is an extremely hardworking, honest, and dedicated loan officer who has the gift of being able to minimize the stress associated with buying a home. I will refer everyone I know to this incredible loan officer.</text><resp>None< /resp>< gmapID>

<Review>I had the privilege to work with Elizabeth Flores to purchase my first home. She's knowledgeable about everything you'll need. And will even help you try to obtain everything it. She made me feel right at home with her sweet spirit and her spunky personality. So if you think you're ready to buy a home she will get the job done. It was an honor and a blessing to work with her.< /Review><date>1582856731878<//date>< userid>

I cannot recommend New American Funding and Marc Flexen enough.  Marc worked endlessly to configure my loan to be in MY best interest.   No hidden fees, no surprises at closing, only honest hard work and helpful advice the entire process.  Marc and the underwriters made this a pleasure to refinance with them.< /text>

New American Funding headed by Loan Officer David Castillo did an excellent job in the VA Refinancing Process for my home keeping me informed of the entire process progression and providing excellent support.
The process was quick and easy and resulted in a lock in of the lowest available interest rate and a good decrease in my monthly payment.     The experience was the best I ever had in a loan process.</review>

Brad Leos was great to refinance with. He explained all the steps we would be going through. He explained all the refinancing costs thoroughly so I knew exactly what it involved.  My process only took 22 days and he and his team made the whole process very easy for me! Definitely great to work with!<//Review>

She was the agent that assisted me in our home refinance.  Michelle  was an absolute pleasure to work with. Her professionalism and attention to detail made this transaction an absolute joy.  Michelle was patient in directing me to the proper documentation, and assisted me in acquiring for her what was needed.  Because of Michelle, I will not hesitate to recommend New American Funding.<//Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

Working with Andy Coronado and New American Funding was a great experience.  He was always available when I emailed him, answered my questions promptly.  He made this refinance an enjoyable experience!  When was the last time you heard that!?  I have recommended him and NAF to my family and friends.</review>

Marc refinanced our vacation house. He did a great job. We canceled our other refinance company and went with Marc and his team. If your in need of refinancing be sure to use them.</review>

<Time>1522243081519< /Time><rate>5<//rate><Text>Within 2 weeks of contacting New American Funding and speaking with Michael Lee, we successfully re-financed our mortgage.  Over about 2 months we had contacted a few companies offering excellent service and prompt action but only New American Funding produced.  We never had to leave our house, Michael guided us through each step either by phone or email.  Our only reason to refinance was to pay off a Home Equity Line of Credit and we are guessing since it was not a large amount other companies were not interested due to the small commission they were likely to receive at completion (just guessing).   We highly recommend Michael Lee if you need accurate, patient and professional service.  We would suggest anyone requesting Michael specifically.</Text>< pictures>

The best part about this experience was Timothy's willingness to provide financial guidance as I embarked on this journey for the first time. He was professional, always honest, and always followed through. His work ethic is amazing! He was on top of his paperwork and was able to help me close on my first home in 30 days! He had confidence and got me everything I needed to achieve my goal of being a homeowner. I am pleased with his service and everyone I connected with at New American Funding.<//Review>

Michael answered any & every question I had, and frequently updated me about my loan status. I know he worked hard to make the loan happen quickly, especially since it was the holiday season. Michael was on top of things;  we were able to get into our new home before Christmas, what a great present for us all! Thanks so much</review>

Ryann did an amazing job, not once but twice!! Thanks to her expert knowledge in the VA home loan services she was able to get my family and I into our first home 7 months ago.  And just a few days ago she was able to get us into a new VA refi to get us a lower rate and cheaper monthly payment. She is a true professional and I would 100% recommend her to anyone looking for a home loan!!</text>

Emil J Canchola was my loan consultant for my mortgage which closed in November 2017. He was very fast communicating via e-mail.  He was always communicating the process of the loan and what needed to be completed. He made the whole loan process clear. He was very professional. It was a pleasure working with him. I will definitely work with him again and recommend him to anyone looking for mortgage.<//review>

Top notch, very thorough! As a first time home buyer, we were very naive and did not know what to expect. Ryann with New American Funding, made our experience easy and worry free. She kept us updated constantly, and made sure we knew what was happening. Highly recommend New American Finding!<//text>

Fast, friendly and great service.  I had a refi with cash out to buyout the ex. You just tell them your circumstances and they work with you to get you the most that you can get. Even the notary was awesome! Great team of professional and caring individuals.  Takes the stress out of the process.  Thank you American Funding!!< /text>

Michael and his team are super kind, knowledgeable and efficient . Especially Shawna in the Riverside branch she was "on point " with all the help and communication back and forth to get paperwork done in timely fashion.

Craig vercnocke with New American Funding was great he was very honest as I called other company's that gave me higher rates but then wanted to match the rate Craig vercnocke gave me up front . They all should be as honest as Craig was and give you the best deal upfront.< /text>

Customer service is great, however I would prefer a different type of tortilla. The meat is well-cooked and has good flavor. The salsas aren't that great.</review>

This place was amazing!! The tacos and burritos are delicious. I usually eat a burrito, a torta and a few tacos at other joints to fill me up, but here 1 burrito was enough to have me filled. I highly recommend this place<//text>

Came to visit this excellent establishment. Ordered a Carne asada, al pastor and Barbacoa taco plus a side of beans and a drink. The meat was far beyond my expectations, the guacamole made me feel at home, and the salsa was the icing on the cake. Highly recommended stopping by Street Tacos and Grill to get a taste of home.< /Text>

<Text>Several years ago my mom introduced me to this grill gem with their veggie tacos... I WAS AMAZED!! I LOVE the Vegetarian Tacos with no tofu (optional).  The veggie tacos are so DELICIOUS and YUMMY fresh ingredients all the perfect greens, flavor, and sauce!  Never ever have I came across street veggie tacos in Boyle Heights/East LA that is "second to NONE" because they make Veggie Tacos #1!  Highly recommend this grill joint!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><response>None</response><gmapID>0x80c2c611dca3b36d:0x9e850dad1eae8f0c</gmapID></record>

I swear these are the best 🌮 you can find. Everything I've had from here is amazing. If you're in or near Boyle Heights you need to go and eat here. You will not be disappointed.

*UPDATE* We come to this spot all the time. Still best taco spot in Boyle Heights. Staff is hella cool and friendly and the food is always bomb</Text>

I grew up going to Tijuana 3-4 times a month, spent weekends there as a teen on occasions. The food took me back to that era. From the smells to the flavors of the Al Pastor, th Carne Asada and the Fish tacos. Let's talk about that smoky, sweet heat of the roasted habanero sause. Then wash it down with some Delicious home made Horcharta (I'll be waiting for your recipe. Jk), the refreshing Jamaica, but the drink that took me by surprise was the kale/pineapple/ cucumber agua fresca (Tastes like Banana). Talk about thirst quenching and refreshing. When I'm in the area again, I'll be sure to stop bye, better yet. I'll be hoping they bring their food to theTemecula Valley area. BTW, the staff is friendly, and lively. Este Lugar esta al cien.<//Review>

I got the half slab ribs with Mac and cheese and collard greens.. Soo good! I tried the sweet potato pie but was not a fan. Buttttt the Mac and cheese is sooo good. I normally don't like creamy Mac and cheese but it is just right! Great flavor.. the greens are kind of sweet... But I loved them.. the ribs actually had meat on them! Not overcooked! Customer service isn't bad either.. I'll be back here for sure! But always for takeout; the place is kind of cramped and they do get busy</review>< pictures>

This place is simply the best taco spot in boyle heights. Period. I am slowly working through the complete menu. One item,(or two or three!) at a time.</Text>

Great place, decent prices, and the best carne asada tacos I've had thus far. And primo's and guisados are just a few blocks away, so that says a lot. Keep up the amazing work, chaps!< /text>

<review>Warning: you may become addicted! If you appreciate a good authentic taco with fresh ingredients, this is your place. The tortillas are hand made and cooked to order, topped with clean meat and fresh condiments.

I ordered a shrimp taco and a barbacoa taco.  They were both different but equally tasty. This was probably some of the best barbacoa I have had. The shrimp taco was loaded with succulent shrimp, cabbage and a special sauce.

They also have vegetarian selections, and their kale water with chia seeds is very refreshing. If you like good food and great service, Street tacos and grill is the way to go!< /review></record>

Why does this place not have an hour-long line out the door?

Also... The handsome, tall person with slicked hair who works the counter is kind.< /review>

Great service was able to eat in and enjoy time with mom ams granddaughter. Pizza was good. Drinks were pepsi not coke. Restrooms clean and tables disinfected. Needed to wear mazk while ordering the staff has to pour your fountain drinks bur still refills available..the 8 akice pizza was the amount we wanted and took 3 slices home cuz we were full. Fun place has arcade area with a prize machine. T.v even if sports was on all three t.vs. a  lil bar area for just grabbing quick bite and a beer. No hard alcohol.. No salid bar. Always great pizza the staff made it even better.</Text>

This was the cleanest Round Table I've ever been to. The amount of TVs were perfect for any sport and the large and nice looking seating area was very comfortable.  I cant help but mention the 3 workers that were there that day because all of them where helpful, pleasant and gave us a "nice" resturant feel.< /review>

I had salad on my plate that I couldn't finish and the associate wouldn't allow me to take it home. He was very adamant that it's dine in only. He wanted to charge us for a salad to go  It was freezing cold in there too.</text>

I like this pizza but there are a couple of local places in town with cheaper, better pizza. I know everything is going up in price but $40 for a pizza seems crazy to me. It's a large cracker with toppings.< /Review>

My wife and I had dinner here. The pizza was good , also enjoyed the salad bar, however our "boneless wings" were more like chicken nuggets covered in sauce. Also apparently Wednesday night is meeting night here . An there was two meetings going on around us.</text>

I am extremely impressed with my tax Pro Stephanie Hernandez. She have a personalized contact making sure my taxes was on time. My observation, Stephanie has a professional attitude in which I see as the embodiment of H&R Block. Thank you.</Text>

It was our first time going to a professional tax person. We loved our tax representative, Diana. She explained everything and was very clear with the things she needed so we did not need to go back and forth. Everything was quick, easy, and not complicated. We absolutely recommend H&R block and we will be sticking with them for our future tax appointments.<//Text>

Elena McBound is awesome!  Her calmness is very welcomed during this time of year 👍.  Elena is polite, courteous, friendly and has  a great sense of humor.  My wife and I have only been going to her for 2 years and we will continue to use her for our taxes every year.< /Review>

As a first time rider and bike owner, they were very helpful. They showed me every thing I would need to be safe. They treated me with the up most respect, like I had been shopping there for years. I will be doing all my shopping for gear, parts, and accessories.</Review>

These guys are great. Always willing to offer an opinion if asked, and they love to talk motorcycles. They make sure to ask you if you need any help, but aren't pushy. Noah went out of his way to help me the other day by giving me a few wheel weights from the back, so I could balance my wheels at home.< /text>

Great shop in a convenient location. The kind of folks who want you to inform you about the differences between products before you decide which to buy. Always willing  to spend time if you  have questions to ensure your satisfied with what you purchase. Richard has always been a great help. Also, they host bike nights for local riders to get together and encourage all riders to attend.<//Review>

<review>This is the place to go for anything motorcycles. Fantastic team of employees who all know their stuff and try their hardest to make your experience a great one. They host bike night every month, which is a lot of fun and is a great place to meet other riders. They'll also go out of their way to get you the best price on the highest quality product, and sometimes you'll find some fantastic closeout deals! Finally, their return policy is outstanding, and customer service never fails to disappoint. Whether you're just getting into riding, or have been in the saddle for years, Cyclegear SLO will go out of their way for you.< /review>< Pics>

This store is the place to go for any of your motorcycle needs. I was helped by Melody there and she was supper helpful. She was very knowledgeable about all of the items, and when they didn't have my size for a certain jacket, she had one transfered from any other store and it arrived the next day. I will definitely be returning when I'm in the market for my next purchase.<//Text>

<Text>These guys at this location were accommodating enough to let me borrow some tools they normally would be selling to remove my front wheel from a Triumph Tiger due to a flat, since it was a Sunday and any motorcycle/auto shop is closed. We were doing a trip down the coast from San Francisco to Phoenix. We brought the wheel to them because the bike could not be moved from it's location safely, and they changed out the tube and just charged for it and labor. They were life-savers in getting us back on the road.</Text><userid>116609140668328899303<//userid>< rating>

They almost always have the parts I need in stock and if not they can get them really quickly. I've been there for parts on all of my last 4 bikes, it would be a nightmare trying to service them all without having a decent shop close by.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

The gang at Cycle Gear are always helpful. They do not try to sell you stuff you don't need and they never pressure you. They are very knowledgeable about the items that they sell. If they do not have it in stock they will order it into the store and are great about calling you as soon as it comes in. Bike nights are always a treat. Great prizes and they even feed you. Stop in you will be treated well.< /Text>

<review>This place has an excellent selection of motorcycle gear and equipment. The prices aren't bad either for a retail location, and I've always been pleased with the customer service I get! I usually drive down from Paso to the store if I need motorcycle gear, if that tells you anything.<//review>< pics>

<review>I call cyclegear early in the day asking for a certain part and if they had it in stock, she asked to give me a call back soon. I said okay and waited 3 hours before I decided to call them. Later that day I go into the store to pick up some handgaurds.. I said to the worker that the handgaurds had looked like like they were bought /returned so he took 10% off. Long story short the package was missing all the hardwar and I have to drive an hour just because the store messed up.<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

A lot of cheaply made gear, but at least you can check it out before you buy it. More often than not they don't have what I want or need, but at least they are there. Buying somethings online is sketchy and Cycle Gear helps in those cases. Also, they can save you if you are in need on a road trip.<//Review>

The place in itself is so beautifully set. The welcome was very warm and the staff is more than happy to assist you. There's lot of options on the decoration for so many different occasions in a huge book that you can selet from. I had bought a red velvet cake and it was so tasty and moist. Relished it. Also the way they packed the cake was very beautiful. I left this place feeling very happy.</review>

I went in to get a  birthday cake. The  sales personnel was really helpful. He showed me the different options I had and I walked away a very happy customer.
Beautiful set up and clean.
Definitely going back.<//review>

<Review>The cakes here are amazing, and the people that work here are friendly and helpful.  I would highly recommend here as we have purchased their cupcakes here on a number of occasions for events and gifts.

The red velvet is so good!< /Review>< pics>

Very welcoming & a beautiful place. Their cakes are really good. The shop looks really nice with colorful decorations all around. They also had a lemon cake for tasting. We bought cup cakes & they were super soft & filling. Chocolate Chip & Confetti Cake were done really nice & were worth the money spent.< /Text>

Well didn't actually go to this place, but I received the individual as a gift from my son (Kris) for Mother's Day.  I wasn't gonna eat it but the smell is so good just like a temptation that you wouldn't want to eat it. Just like the apple from Adam and Eve's story.  But anyway the looks of the cake it was very moist and tasty.  Here goes my blood sugar level!!! Ate half of the cake until didn't realize is gone.  This is very good when it's the rainy season, I mean when you are stressed out,  or you've been out of a relationship this will help ease the pain for a bit. Meaning the sweetness of the cake will make you happy at no time!!! Can't wait to taste a different flavor 😋< /review>

<text>"NBC"  is celebrating Bundt Cake day today by giving out free Bundtlets to all between 11:15 am and 12:15 pm.

And boy you should see the line outside.

I do agree with all the good qualities  that NBC cakes have, but am amazed at its popularity ... or is it because of free Bundtlet.. well my better half believes it is for the former and latter being only an excuse... what can I say.. I agree with her, no matter what, else she will not share the Bundtlet with me!!!

All things set aside they make the best cakes ever!!</text>< Pics>

<rating>3<//rating><Review>The portion sizes for the cupcakes and cakes are really good. Some may argue that they are pricey, but I believe that they are worth it.
However, I feel that the cupcakes have been getting too sweet for my taste, and I wish they would change the way they make their cupcakes.</Review>< Pics>

<review>During the pandemic, curbside pickup and delivery is available. After a bumpy bike ride home rustling the bundtinis around in their box, they live up to the high expectations. Slightly jostled but still intact, the cakes are phenomenal. Moist, not too sweet, and wonderful flavors!< /review><pics>None<//pics></record>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Bought an 8 inches red velvet cake. It wasn't that great. The base was so hard and it was extremely sweet. The cake didn't justify the high rating of the shop. Also all cakes are made in same design which is really lame. A 10 bucks cake in croger or wallmart tastes way better than this.<//review>< Response>

<Text>Nothing but bundt cakes...really?? I don’t know why they are selling themselves short. They definitely have more than just bundt cakes. Sure they have a lot of bundt cakes, I’d probably say majority of things they sell are bundt cakes, but to say they have nothing else is absurd. I get trying to be modest and stuff, but I think they are going too far. Like if I ran a mile in 5 mins and 30 secs, I wouldn’t tell people that I ran it in 6 mins. I would either say I ran it in 5 mins and 30 secs or I’d lie and say I ran it in 5 mins if I was really trying to brag. Nothing but Bundt Cakes doesn’t need to lie or brag, they just need to tell the truth! They’re offering more than just bundt cakes! Besides the stupid sign, I love this place. By far my favorite place to get bundt cakes and other things.<//Text>< user_id>

High quality cakes that are more to the cake than frosting.  Frosting good too.   If you are going to have cake,  you might as well eat quality ingredients, freshness, and great cake.  These always go well at work for birthdays and events too.< /Review>

Nothing Bundt Cakes make delicious bundt cakes in different sizes. They're perfect for a single serving (mini) or get a large one for a birthday/baby shower/event! There's easy parking at this location since it's located in a strip mall.< /Text>

This is located in a strip mall with abundant parking. They have a variety of bundt cakes that taste yum. They sell different candles. Prices are reasonable.</Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>I've had their full size bundt cakes, the individual portion, and the little bundtinis. They are all equally moist and delicious.

This was my first time visiting the actual store to buy something and the employee working was wonderful. She even offered to carry my order to my car when she saw I had my baby with me. I thought it was so kind of her to go the extra mile!

I bought the premade dozen assorted bundtinis box and they were a hit. So convenient and delicious.</review>< pictures>

<text>Love nothing Bundt cakes. So delicious! Staff is also very friendly. I have ordered full size bundt cakes for groups. I also love their smaller bundtinis, a cake for just a small family. Bundtlets, their cupcake equivalent is also awesome. Free tasting samples too. Seasonal flavors. Love red velvet. They have two types of frosting. Ask for the lighter version, divine but not as bad for you.</text>< GmapID>

+Moist, dense, and the perfect size for every occasion!

+My favorite flavors are the red velvet with chocolate chips and the white chocolate raspberry.

+Need a last minute potluck item? Their Bundtinis are a dozen bite sized cakes in various or same flavors for under $20!

+The Bundtlets are great for sharing with one other or for a generous self indulgent snack.

+Very reasonable pricing

+LOVE LOVE LOVE the cream cheese frosting! You can ask for their classic drizzle or a heavier drizzle for extra icing :)< /Text>

Lets get this straight: I love NBC even though I dont care much for sweets/desserts.

This location is the closest to where I work and from time to time we get these at work for the whole team. They offer small, medium size cupcakes and even cakes that you can use for birthdays or occasions. Sure they are a bit on the pricier side but hey they are totally worth every penny. If you like cupcakes and havent tried this place yet, stop everything and just go there to try it out. Trust me, you wont regret it. My favorite at this location is the Red Velvet cupcake. I dont know if its their perfectly moist cupcake or their icing but it just melts in your mouth. I have tried a few of their other flavors and they also have different seasonal flavors and free samples at their store from time to time but for me, nothing beats red velvet, not even chocolate!

Parking in easy at this location and timings are also pretty decent for you to get a Bundtini any time of the day!< /review>

<Rating>5</Rating><Text>I loved Nothing Bundt Cakes!  If you want a unique baked treat, this is your place. Think of this place like a cupcake place for bundt cakes.  They make mini bundt cakes called 'bundtletts' that are absolutely amazing.  Even better than the fact that their baked treats are delicious is that on your birthday, you get a free bundtlett.  Amazing? I think so.

They also have samples so you can give their cake a try before buying.  I think that the ratio of moisture is a little better in their larger cakes and in their samples, but that doesn't make the bundletts bad by any means.  Just don't expect them to be as moist as the sample you just tried. :)

Overall, this is a great go to place if you are looking for a baked treat.  My favorites are the chocolate and red velvet.  They also have some crazier flavors like their pineapple upsidedown which is amazing as well.< /Text><name>Alyx Barranger< /name></record></dataset><record>

I usually stop here on my way to Redding for a quick respite. The ladies room is very clean, which doesn't happen often anymore.  Good snacks. Great doughnuts. They have just about everything else you need to be on your way again.<//Review>

Wow this place is everything you would want in a convenient store, gas station slash deli.  Fair prices not just for los mo.  Locals know what I mean.  Sandwiches are off the chain good, staff friendly and polite.  The selection of snacks and drinks are endless. Not to mention the overall cleanliness of the place.  No dirty employees, no sticky floors, no foul tasting pop or any of the other cons you find at the other service stations in that town.  Way to crosslands for running a tight ship!< /text>

My experience was AMAZING! Natalie helped me with all of the financing and I couldn’t be more happy with my purchase of new 2021 Jeep Cherokee Latitude!! The process was fast, easy and super friendly. I told Natalie what I was working with and she made it happen for me. Thank you SO much. I am in love with my new car and couldn’t have asked for better service.<//review>

The sales team here are phenomenal, they work very hard and go far beyond what other dealers will to put you into the car or truck of your dreams. I just recently bought a 2017 Dodge Ram 1500, and honestly my credit is less than perfect, I was upside down on the loan with my trade in. Norma n Jimmy my sales team worked very very hard to get me outta my previous loan and negative equity, to get me into the truck I've always wanted n needed. I'm very appreciative and humbled by my experience with these folks, and I highly recommend them to everyone in search of a new car, trade in, or upgrade. They're Awesome.< /Text>

We were very disappointed with our experience. We found a vehicle we liked, and went in to discuss finances. We were shown a piece of paper with the price of the vehicle that we were happy with, and agreed to proceed with financing and a credit check. We negotiated the finance rate and once we were happy with the rate, we were given a "final price." The "final price" had a sale price for the vehicle that was $5000 more than the original price they quoted (the "new" price was the sticker price).  When we pointed this out they first told us that we were incorrect, and when we asked to see the original paper they said "it was a mistake" and there was "nothing they could do." The manager offered to take $500 off the sticker price, as the "best they could do." The price difference, while substantial, was less concerning than their incompetence, apparent lies, and unethical business practices.<//Text>

<Rating>5< /Rating><review>I had a 2015, RAM 2500 and wanted to get a new 2018 with some options I did not get on my 15.  I knew exactly what I wanted and tried to work with several dealerships in the Sacramento area.  Each time I would get the deal all worked out, the dealership would try to make some last minute change.  I got the run around for over two weeks.  I called Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram and spoke with Terry Livings (Sales Manager).  I explained exactly what I wanted.  He said he would call me back in two hours and when he did he had located exactly the truck I was looking for and the deal he put together was BETTER than the best deal I had been offered at the other dealers.  This was on a Wednesday, I came in on Saturday and he the truck ready to go.  Another sales manager Marty helped us do some of the final paperwork and the finance dept. was a breeze.  My wife and I purchase cars often and have high expectations of the dealership.  These folks are the best we have worked with in many years.  It’s worth the extra drive to Lodi.  I highly recommend!</review></record></dataset><record>

I would give no stars if possible. This dealers service manager Joe admitted they did not diagnose vehicle by the Chrysler factory repair manual. I feel that is the purpose of the dealer otherwise you can go to any shop. Good luck anybody going in for service at this dealer.
If the owner Leonard Harrington of this dealer really cares about customer service I hope they reach out to me. I have also filed a complaint with Chrysler regarding this dealers service center.</Review>

This dealership sold me a truck with aftermarket alterations that caused catastrophic damage to the axle on my $50,000 heavy duty truck.  They do not return my calls, respond to emails, certified letters, or even the Bureau of Automotive Repair!  But they certainly respond to all of the positive reviews left for them.  As soon as there is a problem they scurry and hide.  The last I heard from Hope, the service manager, she was supposed to call me back on October 28.  Still no call.  I did receive a call from Shannon Reilly, the sales manager, that they would fix the axle at their dealership only.  He said he would send me details of the repair offer by mail.  January 2021, still not a call, letter, or even an apology that their repair shop toasted a $10,000 axle.  Shannon, I’ve left you 4 messages, where is my offer to repair that was ‘in the mail’?

I look forward to my day in court. I will also publicly post the judges/arbitration orders on this review.< /text>

Ram 2500 cummins

One star says it all....no need to make it long.

Agreed price thru text was $59,411 OTD. Drove 2.5 hours with my family and wasted another 2 hours at the dealership, incorrect price.

Was ready to take the truck for $59,411 even with the dent on the pass side door and the 2 paint chips on the Dvr door....glad things didnt work out.....would have driven me crazy on a black truck.<//Text>

Offered us 6,000 less for our trade in than anyone else. Waited for a very long time to find that out. I had already talked to the salesman about the trade in. He must have not actually looked it up until we drove 1-1/2 hours to get there.</review>

<Review>I had a great experience buying a new Jeep Cherokee at Lodi Jeep. Andy, the sales representative, made the purchase process extremely smooth. He showed me multiple options within my budget, he presented me the pros and cons of each vehicle, and ultimately he helped me deciding among the multiple options without being pushy. I would definitely recommend my experience with Andy and Lodi CDJR.  I also had a great experience with their service department. Rick and team were extremely knowledgeable and helpful.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><rate>5< /rate>< Response>

It’s interesting how all the reviews are either 1 star or 5 stars.  I also find it interesting how many people have had good experiences at this dealership when many many more have not.  As soon as a 1 star review shows up, they counteract it with 5 star reviews.  It’s pretty simple to look at the dates of the reviews and how they correspond.  They always say that the negative reviews are the ones that people write, so what is incentivizing the 5 star reviews??  Hmmmm, maybe it’s a free car wash.  Whatever it is, it’s certainly not an accurate depiction of what is going on at Lodi CDJR. One review here states a customer literally witnessed the acknowledgment of a bait and switch between manager and salesman.  WHAT?!  How is this company still in business?!<//Review>

<review>Worst place to purchase a vehicle they sold me a vehicle back in august that was involved in a accident don’t know how they got the car fax to come back as no accidents but there is clear evidence that the car was damaged before. I took car to a body shop to get detailed and they pointed out to me that the vehicle had been damaged before so bad that the paint don’t even match. Never payed attention to it at the angle the shop showed me, also when I was doing contract they never disclosed that they were charging me for security system that I never asked for in the first place until I was signing I saw a charge asked them what it was for they said we install this system in the cars so we have to charge you for it. It’s a good tracking system don’t get me wrong but they never told me about hoping I didn’t pay attention. Then yesterday when I called them to disclose what I had discovered there answer was that’s what you get for buying a used car. I guess in a way there right but just want to make people aware of my situation please people do business elsewhere. They are terrible god bless<//review><pictures>None< /pictures><Response>None< /Response>< gmapID>

<Text>They wanted to charge me multiple service hours for a simple item repair  that was left incomplete (GPS reset & re-calibration).

I want to love this Dealership, but unfortunately have been left with a bad taste in my mouth.  I sold a Jeep back to them recently and the overall experience was great.  They gave me a fair price and made it easy.  Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the service department. When I picked up my car I had to pay for a repair that was never completed. On the way home my wife was not only able to diagnose the problem, but also able to fix it in a matter of minutes. No extra computer skills or equipment necessary. I struggled with the service department to get a refund and instead was told it was my fault and I needed to pay for the technician's time. "Fighting for the customer" was never a concern. I was told it was a potential warranty repair, but then was not given any break in diagnostic price because nothing was "broken." In regard to warranty repair I was simply left hanging with a bill. Tim's customer service skills are horrendous.  Hope, (the service manager), was pleasant after the fact and only charged me for 1/2 hr. diagnostic, but too little too late. I was still charged for something they never fixed (and we fixed before we even got home- insert eye-roll here.)< /Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

This place has the best customer service hands down! They went above and beyond to get me the trade that we really wanted . We had went to the dealer in Newark and they seemed like they either didn’t know what they were doing or just didn’t care.They ran my credit and left empty handed bc they couldn’t find me a deal, I had to put $8,000 down in order to trade my car I was loosing hope after that. But  After calling around and my husband found this dealer in Lodi and just by talking to them on the phone I really felt like that were really trying to help and that they care. Long story short we drove from Fremont to Lodi after they had told us they were able to do the trade on our truck. We walked out that dealer ship with our brand new 2021 truck with a low rate! Of 4.6 ! I went from 11 or 12% to 4.6! Like wow! If I could give Chuck and Steve more than five stars I would give them 100! I’m sooo happy and so thankful for them! Thanks again guys for doing the impossible for us!<//text>

Worst service department I've seen in a long time. Called twice on a Thursday to make an appointment, Ring/No answer. Called the following Saturday morning to make an appointment, transferred to service dept.three times, Ring/No answer. Drove to dealership. Waited for service, no acknowledgement of my presence by two service techs. Sign said open on Saturday to better serve you, by appointment only. You can't make an appointment because nobody is answering the phone. From now on...Lasher Elk Grove, will be where I go.</Text>

Was looking at a truck but the monthly came out to be too much. Went to my plan b and was looking at a trade-in fiesta that they had on the lot. The KBB trade-in value for it is $4k but they had it listed for $9k, a $5k markup than what they gave the guy for as his trade-in. They tried forcing a $1,100 gps on me as well. Such a joke. Remember, this is a business. They make not one, not two, but many thousands from each vehicle they sell. Do yourself a favor and don’t get scammed, find a good private party deal and get an auto loan from your local credit union. Dealerships like this are major rip-offs!</text>< date>

<text>My first time going to Lodi CDJR to look to buy been there just looking around but i went on 1/29/21 to actaully purchase I meet Michael C which is a great help. He helped me find my jeep (anyones price range) and i absolutely love my jeep. It was a very great experience for me and my family so if you are looking for a newer car,truck,van, suv please stop by your local Lodi CDJR dealership and ask for Michael C. The staff is very friendly and they are not pushy and that is one thing i dont like is pushy people. Wondeful dealership located on Beckman Road in Lodi go check them out you wont be sorry. Thanks to everyone at Lodi CDJR< /text>< gmap_id>

The staff  is exceptionally professional and friendly and will do whatever it takes to get you the car or truck you desire within your price range and budget.

Showroom and lot is very clean, and LCDJR has an excellent selection of vehicles to choose from.

Highly recommended.</Review>

They bait and switched me.  When I spoke to the manager Shannon about it, he said that they would never do that.  That it’s illegal.  After using the restroom I literally walked right into him telling his salesman to be more careful and that next time it could be a serious problem if the public were to catch on.  Wow.<//text>

Feb, 15, 2020 we were looking to purchase a Ram truck. We 1st stopped at a different location and were treated so badly we left.
Then we went Lodi CDJR. Met Chuck, what a pleasant breath of fresh air. Accommodating is an understatement.  We left with our Ram and have never been happier with a car buying experience. We highly recommend this  dealership,  and you won't find a better more attentive salesman than Chuck.</review>

The salesman was nice but didnt seem to really "listen" to what we were looking for. When we finally got them to hear what it was we wanted we were then given over to their "internet specialist".  Not wanting to waste anyone's time, we asked if they had that vehicle with the options we wanted in their stock and the "internet specialist" said without skipping a beat "No we don't- goodbye."  We immediately turned and left. He was rude, disrespectful and arrogant. We will NOT be stopping there ever again.< /review>

I’ve bought numerous cars before and I have never had an experience like this where the sales person was so disrespectful and pushy. My girlfriend and I saw a car that we liked online so decided to go check it out. We called because we had a question before stopping by and STEVE M. answered so we told him we were on our way. We went for a test drive and loved the car so we decided to sit down and work out a deal. Steve disclosed that he was going to present numbers first and then if we liked what they could offer he would run credit. After reviewing we told him the numbers wouldn’t work with out budget and he kept asking us what we didn’t like. I would try to explain and he kept cutting us off and talking over us saying we weren’t being reasonable and how great of a deal it was. He started to get argumentative and defensive and began getting louder and louder as if he was trying to intimidate us into buying a car even if we weren’t comfortable with the terms of the financing. I don’t know if he was talking to us in that manner because we were women or if that’s just the way he does business. He finally took no for an answer and said he would go grab our keys from the trade in. HE THEN COMES BACK WITHOUT OUR KEYS AND TELLS US THAT HE RAN CREDIT WHEN WE CLEARLY TOLD HIM WE WEREN’T INTERESTED. We now have to deal with sending disputes in to the credit bureaus because credit was checked without consent. DO NOT VISIT THIS DEALERSHIP.<//text>

When I got there I had a salesman tell me they were too busy and come back. That got me a little upset made a phone call to the manager and then spoke to the salesman and ended up going back. I had a truck I wanted to buy and was qualified, I had more money down that I was willing to tell them to make my payments were I wanted them, we were trying to work a deal. It got tough for Alex the salesmen and another customer came in that he had appointment as well and he left me to go to him....not very good business. I’ve bought three cars from them I will never buy another. I also find it funny that the owner only comments on the 5 star reviews.

Went to the website and saw the car I wanted to purchase.  A great guy named Cruz (salesman) helped me with the process.  It was fast and easy.  I bought the car as a Wedding gift for my daughter - so Cruz arranged to have bow placed on the car when we picked it up.  Great salesman and great team!!< /review>

I bought my Redeye widebody challenger here..when the day came to come in and sign papers, they had entirely different numbers than what I expected.  The salesman kept trying to talk over me and say I was wrong and distract me..I refused to allow that to happen..After much back and forth and refusing to accept what I was being told, come to find out there was $73 extra in taxes they say was an error, there was $895 added for an alarm app that I stated multiple times I did not want, nor did I ever request it.It was simply added to my papers..Finally after arguing about not wanting the alarm app, I went into finance to sign the papers..Believe it or not his numbers once again didnt match up..Upon looking, they STILL HAD THE $895 in my documents, trying to sneak it by.

Upon arriving home I noticed a small ding or dent that happened during shipping or at the dealership..I immediately contacted them and sent them pics..I was told they had a dent guy that would take care of it.  I was later contacted stating if I wanted to pay for it, the dent guy could come to my house and fix it..(a dent I didnt even cause)  I attempted to contact the dent guy twice and have not heard back.

The shipping guard was supposed to be removed prior to my arrival to pick up the car. It of course wasnt..I had to return the next day to have it done. Upon return of my car from the shop, I noticed a ding in one of my brand new wheels.  I made them aware of this and was once again given the number of a wheel guy..That once again I could pay for..for a wheel they damaged.  He returned my call and the dealership stated that if I take my car to them when the wheel guy is there the dealership MAY help me..

And finally here appeared to be an issue with all 4 of the brand new tires on the car...what appeared to be a defect..when I inquired I was told I was on my own and the dealership had nothing to do with it...I contacted Dodge Customer Care who contacted the dealer and called me back and said they were rude as hell to her (one of their own) and even yelled at her...She recommended that I find another dealership to deal with that this dealership wasnt very good.

So I texted the dealership today to coordinate the wheel and dent guy to see if this dealership was going to do ANYTHING to assist with damage to my wheel they caused, dent to my car caused by others, or address the tire issue. I HAVENT HEARD ANYTHING BACK..what a shock...

So I took it to Les Schwab and resolved the tires...Im stuck with the dent and scraped wheel that they did, and also a chip in the front bumper that was repaired by them and lasted all of 24 hrs before returning...

So shotty repair on the one item they did fix, avoidance of responsibility on the dent and even on damage they themselves caused...All the while trying to take me for over $1000 extra dollars for stuff I didnt request and even DECLINED 3 times...only to try and sneak the papers by and get signed...NOT THE PLACE TO CONDUCT BUSINESS!</text>

<Text>I test drove a couple of cars here last week I enjoyed the experience about what made me a little uncomfortable is that covid-19 is going around and when you test drive somebody is in the car with you. I test drove at other places in the same week and they let me drive the car by myself. When someone is in a car with you you have the pressure of buying the vehicle but especially during this covid it puts the salesperson and the customer at risk.<//Text><response>None<//response></record></dataset><record>

If you’re a first time buyer and don’t know exactly what you want and the terms you want it under, do not come here. I have a lot of experience in car buying and I still feel like I got screwed over and manipulated. I was rushed and pressured into making a decision and was told repeatedly that if I don’t hurry up and sign the papers, they would be “pissed” at me. The finance manager, Michael, did not explain anything to me that I was signing and the sales manager, Marty, quoted me completely different from what I actually ended up paying. The customer service overall is terrible at this location. Take your money somewhere else.< /review>

If I could give this place a negative review, I would. They’re really rude and not helpful at all. The Sales Manager Steve Magana needs a lesson on customer interaction and not be rude to customers. Saying stuff like “are you going to buy a car or are you going to waste my time” is not the way to sell a vehicle. This person also lied on the listing and discount offered and got rude when we presented a flyer to him. I would recommend to go elsewhere.< /Text>

I had to sue them to repair my truck that their service department damaged.  Close to $10,000 in repairs!  And they didn’t even provide me with a car rental.  Go ahead.  Buy from them!< /review>

Okay the only reason I’m giving a five star review is because our sales person Megan. My daughter came in and bought a dodge journey. She worked so hard to get her into a car. My daughter had some credit problems.  not once did she make us feel bad. Unlike other dealers. Megan was so compassionate, Megan said the only promise I can make is that I will work my butt of for you. And boy she did. She even bought us and my grandkids food.  Now as for the store. it’s a mess...The place is so dirty! The guy that did our paperwork was so rude! Like as if we were a bother to him. I really hated the store. The only reason we bought was because of Megan!</review>

< review>
I went to the Lodi dealer as I received a recall notice. And decided to get the oil changed also on my 2013 Chrysler 300. When the car was finished I noticed the easy exit seat was not working properly. I brought it to the attention of the service guy Tom. He said since I didn't have memory seat buttons on the driver's door that it was impossible for the easy exit seat to operate. I explained to Tom that the easy exit seat was working and has been since I bought the car in 2014or 15. He said he was too busy with other customers to help me and that I should call the Chrysler dealer. , I told him that I would. In the meantime I got on YouTube. And find the video that fixes the easy exit seat. And to do that you turn your car on put the seat all the way back, then put the seat all the way forward put the seat all the way back put the seat all the way forward and then put it all the way back again. Turn off your car. Then turn it back on. And the seat went right back to where it was supposed to be and the telescoping Steering wheel also return to where it should be. So, thanks to the YouTube video. I was able to fix the problem that Tom ignore me about. That's why I only the two stars. And I want to say that this is not a reflection on the rest of the staff. All I know is if my wife is happy that I was able to fix the seat.</review>

Had my daughter turn her keep in for an oil service at around 11. After being told that the Shuttle bus was out & would be back to pick her up she waited for about 90 minutes before calling me to come pick her up. After her car was completed they called her to let her know the store was closing in an hour & the shuttle driver went home for the day. This is not the first time this has happened to her & believe the customer service needs to up their ante on providing more support to their customers when they need to get back home & not stay there for the next 6 hours. We will be taking our services elsewhere & not recommending this place again.</Text>

<Review>Had gone in September they ran our credit and couldn’t get us a good deal on a truck with our decent credit. Got a call from an “upgrade” manager decided to go back to see if they offered a better deal. Tried to make it seem like we didn’t know what we were dealing with and Specifically said NOT TO RE RUN OUR CREDIT, what did they do they RE RAN either way after we said not too! We’re offered a payment like a house payment which first time was cheaper so waste of time. Make sure if you go with them that you have enough knowledge so that they don’t make you feel like time was wasted and don’t let them re run your credit unless you give consent! NEVER GOING BACK AGAIN!< /Review>< username>

I wish you could do no stars.......
Pulled into the service area for an oil change. Sat there waiting at my car for 20 minutes. Not a single employee acknowledged me at any time. Walked inside to the cashier's desk to ask how do I get service. She instructed me to stand out in the bay next to my car and somebody would come to help me. Wasted another 10 minutes standing there. Not a single employee that walked by me acknowledged me or asked if I needed help.
Not the place I will ever go again.
Shame on you Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep!
You guys might want to take a class on customer service!!!< /Review>

We had so many questions about the new Jeeps that we asked the entire Northern California Jeep dealer community, and our sales guy, Ron, turned out to know the most about them.  We love the professionalism that he treated us with, and we decided to buy from him.  He Truly is the best. If you ever need a vehicle call him!< /Review>

< review>
Im still in disbelief this occurred. I went in Sunday May 17th to inquire on a 2013 Ram 2500 that was being advertised for $30,400.00 under 100k mikes great deal. Spoke to the Internet manager through out the deal. I looked at the truck it “wasn’t” ready which it was dirty which was no big deal. We went to his desk to talk business and work a deal. After a few minutes I was told the that the truck price had been adjusted to $37,500 I said ok no problem.

We worked a deal and got approval from a credit union everything was good to go term of the loan etc. Since the truck wasn’t ready to go I signed the document showing the loan info etc. I went home cleaned up the trade-in got it ready to go. On Monday the internet sales manager calls me and said they had issues with the truck and was deemed unsafe so had to be sent to auction. The truck remained on car gurus and Lodi cdjr’s website only this time for $38,231.

I went down to Lodi cdjr on Monday May 18th to try and figure what’s going on and I asked to speak to one of the finance managers well they wouldn’t give me the time of day. The internet manager well at-least he talked to me, but either way to pull out of a deal.

I called Lodi Cdjr this morning May 22nd and was told the truck had been sold yesterday May 21st...< /review>

<Text>Spoke with Andy on the phone the day before I came in about a truck I was interested in. He was overly helpful on the phone and was ready for me even though i showed up 2 hours early to my appointment. I was impressed by how well he knew all the different makes and models and specific features of the ram 2500 and helped me find the EXACT truck I wanted. He made the entire process a breeze and would highly recommend him to anyone looking for a new Dodge!

<review>Went to their website and found a nice truck I wanted. It had a the MSRP and then the dealers price. I emailed them and immediately got a call from Mrs. McQueen. She stated that they have two prices and that. The one on the site and a "E" price. Said she could give me the "E" price if I came down. Drove an hour to get there only to be told that there is no other price. They would not budge. I don't like being lied to or mislead. Sales manager was pretty disrespectful in his demeanor. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.< /review><Date>1568416651277<//Date><rating>1<//rating>< gmapID>

Love dealing with Mike Romero. We’ve now purchased 3 vehicles from him we won’t use anyone else. Him and Christian always make it happen for us. My boyfriend finally got the truck he’s been wanting for a while and I got my challenger. He’s awesome. It’s rare we go in there and leave empty handed and definitely seems like they try their best to get us into something.<//Text>

My experience with Chrysler was a great one. The salesman who helped me was Charlie. He was very knowledgeable and did everything he could to help me and was also very understanding. I genuinely felt he had my best interest at heart while searching for a vehicle and wasn’t just pushing me to buy one like salesmen normally do. I think he deserves some type of incentive or raise. It was because of him that I felt comfortable buying my car even at the monthly payments I got it for. Thank you again for everything.</Review>

<rating>3</rating><Text>The Service Dept. could use a makeover.  There  is no Receptionist to greet you so you have to basically get into someones way to get acknowledged.  I waited 30 minutes for a courtesy shuttle before inconveniencing a family member for a ride.  Upon picking my vehicle up I went through the same shenanigans of standing in the way until acknowledged.  Oh, and all this was with a scheduled appointment.   On the flip side, the vehicle service was performed!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Resp>

We have a new Jeep Wrangler. We took it too this dealership and were very un impressed. We asked for a five tire rotation as part of our Jeep wave program oil and rotation. The service person refused to do it saying that the “spare” is just for looks. I’m flabbergasted as we’ve never had this issue before at other dealerships. Additionally we had it in for a recall and when we went to pick it up we were given the keys and sent to go find it in the parking lot. No walk thru or pull up. Additionally, after having the recall checked out (something for the steering) the Jeep is now pulling to the right significantly! So now we need to have that checked out and fixed and I’m sure this dealership won’t do much. Wouldn’t recommend.<//Text>

Great selection of cars, easy to deal with the sales department and their service is top notch and honest. Another dodge service center had misdiagnosed an alignment problem and I drove an hour to Lodi for an honest 2nd opinion. Saved me thousands!!! Trust earned. Thank you!< /text>

I went in there knowing very little about buying a car. It was my first time; 21 years old and seemingly curious. I got to test drive the car that I really liked. They informed me of all the stats on the car. At signing, I got to ask as many questions as I felt comfortable and they reassured me every time. The conversation was very smooth and it calmed my nerves a lot! This made the biggest decision of my life a little less nerve wracking. Everyone here at this establishment was super great! We laughed at jokes and got serious when needed to be. When it was time to pay the down payment, my card wouldn’t go through. So they let me take the car, I wanted to buy from them to go to the bank to get a cashiers check. That was pretty amazing. All in all, this establishment was friendly, kind and attentive! Would recommend everyone!</Review>

<review>We purchased a vehicle very accomodating. They told us at purchase dince i am a company with several vehicles they would take care of us asap. We ledt 2 messages with service last week no call back. We called today after being oatched thru 2 times was keft on hold for 22 minutes, then called back and disconected again. Called back forbthe 3rd no resolve to get 3 trucks services and make repairs on manufacturer defective items to be replaced. Totally opposite of what the customer service i was told i would get. 5 phone call over a weeks period and still no appointment. 3 trucks need 6 mfg defects repaired in steering, transmission etc. Cant drive to send employees on jobs. Not recommend their service.<//review></record>

<Review>Never made it into the place. They are falsely advertising a Black Widow Ram 1500 at an amazingly low price and then tell you the price is a mistake. And then try to sell you something else. Shady selling practices at it's finest. They know that the ad is bogus and it's still up for at least a week now. Buyers BEWARE!!</Review>< pictures>

Big 0!  My Dodge Ram 1500 has been there for 30 days! They  say it is a egr cooler and there is no part available and no eta for the part. Dodge Chrysler Customer Care is no help either!  I have not been offered a replacement vehicle or reimbursement and no one is giving me straight answers if a part is ever going to be available.  Will never purchase another Dodge and Im so frustrated and disappointed with this dealership service department! At this point it seems my only option is to seek legal advice.</text>

<Text>I bought my first car from them and it was a great experience. Megan Covarrubias helped me out through this whole experience and explain everything. I have been to several dealers when accompanying my parents buy other cars and none have been as transparent as this dealer. They even brought out a chart explaining things like msrp,discounts, add ons, and rebates; which ultimately gave me the final price I was going to pay. I have to say I am extremely pleased with this experience. One thing I should also mention is that I bought the car at a great price, I checked car gurus and it was one of the lowest price (biggest discounts) in all California. Overall I highly recommend this dealer and Megan to anyone.< /Text>< gmap_id>

Steve Magana is a good man, and a great salesman The deal was made pretty simple. I got preapproved beforehand, went to the dealership and found the Challenger RT that I wanted. There was no need in price haggling because that was already the best price in California for that vehicle with the options it had. Glad I did my homework. Happy Holiday's to everyone there at Lodi CDJR.

<time>1558931453722< /time><rating>1< /rating><review>Shady salesmen. Will not wash windows in a used car so you can see the road to drive home! Beware of excessive mileage on vehicle. My car I bought (2016 Toyota Corolla LE ECO) was advertised with 42,000 miles...but the odometer showed 49,000 miles.

Ask for record of service the dealership might have done.  Carefully check the CarFax on the vehicle you wish to purchase.  The Corolla I had purchased was previously in an accident.

Don't fall for maintenance plan from them on a used vehicle. I was set up with a maintenance plan that cost $2,500 - and was an additional $250 PER MONTH in addition to the car payment.  I cancelled the plan immediately.

Customer Service is great. They gave me an estimated cost and a time frame. They stayed within  both estimates. They kept my truck 5 days so they arranged to provide a rental car. I couldn't be happier with their service. I recommend them even if you don't have a dodge! Service Advisor Raymond Ruiz is the best!<//text>

<review>They advertised a vehicle for a good price, they had that vehicle on the lot for the advertised price, and we bought it. No games, no delays and no double talk. Everyone was very cordial and friendly. Even though there were dealers closer to us, they wanted significantly more for the same auto. We would recommend this dealership without hestitation.< /review>< pictures>

We were treated very well from the minute we arrived and until we left with a new Grand Cherokee. Marty listened to our needs and actually talked us out of what we intended to buy. His insight and professional manner were invaluable. We left with a vehicle that fit our needs to a tee. Awesome experience.< /Text>

I brought my vehicle in for service and was helped by Tim who after he took my keys got in my truck let my door swing ! And then after that he still goes on and peels off into another parking spot which was extremely unnecessary NEVER BRINGING IT AGAIN ! If that’s how they treat other people’s cars with them present I can only imagine when the owner isn’t there.<//text>

I had a great experience at the Lodi CDJR! I went in looking for a new Jeep Wrangler to find out brand new just wasn't in the cards for me right now. I had Marshall as a sales rep and Shannon as my finance rep both of which were extremely helpful through the entire process. Later the same week Marshall called us right away to let us know a jeep with everything I was looking for had come in and to come take loot. It was perfect! Shannon and Marshall were so fast with the process of both purchasing the new car and with the process of trading in my old car, I was called multiple times with updates and the communication was great! Over all had a great experience with Lodi CDJR!<//review>

<Text>The sales and finance department are by far some of the best and most professional I have dealt with got me into the truck I wanted no issues. But the same can not be said about the service department every time I have brought my truck in it has been nothing but issues. Things as simple as calling the customer back or making sure you've actually completed the job would be a good start. Had to take it back 3 times to get over spray paint removed and the job still wasn't finished after the 3rd time and now the call my employer to get ahold of me for a shuttle ride when not 10 minutes before I had given them a number to  Call me. All in all i would buy from lodi dodge for all my cars but avoid the service department if you want your vehicle and your sanity!</Text><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< Response>

<rating>1<//rating><text>Put this on yelp and figured google should also have my novel of a review. I'm so highly disappointed in the level of service. We are wanting to buy a new RAM rebel. The initial experience was good although short, we knew exactly what we wanted. We didn’t want to waste anyone’s time going on multiple test drives, bringing out cars, etc. We had an appointment elsewhere and had to leave but we filled out the credit app and they (the sales manager/sales person Hensol Cline lll) said that they’d get back to us that afternoon/evening.

Didn’t hear back.. I get that it gets busy, I used to sell cars. Even when it got busy though I was able to multi task and get back to customers no later than 24 hrs (Maybe our dealership had diff standards). So we didn’t hear back until I called them Monday late afternoon/evening. To receive numbers on a car is typically a 20 min process on average even with about 4 deals at the desk. There weren’t that many customers, the sales people were standing out front talking and our sales person was complaining how slow the foot traffic has been. Anyways, when I called I listen to the sales person cut me off multiple times to tell me he didn’t have numbers and how busy it’s been and that he’d get back to me later. At this point I’m annoyed because we’ve been patient it’s been two days and it feels like we are getting brushed off.

70-80% of a sales persons job is following up and at the very least being courteous. I called again to ask for the sales persons name because I wanted to write this review and I get transferred to the sales manager. I told him I just wanted my sales persons name and he wouldn’t give it to me. He then went on to rudely say “I have a pile of deals here what do you want me to do”. To which I said I just asked for my sales persons name (now I know from the business card I found it’s Hensol Cline) then not long after the sales manager abruptly ended the call. Your team is a reflection of you sir.

I still waited to write this review until my dad got called back. He did finally, he missed it because he was driving and called back and they told him that the person putting together his deal is out and will be back tomorrow and they’ll call us then. 2-3 people told us we’d get numbers today. At this point it’s just unprofessional and honestly a lot of games.

I’ve never been treated so poorly. We’ve bought many cars from ford to Jeep, Nissan and 3 from Mercedes. We always we get backend, give perfect CSI’s and it’s generally a very easy experience.

Went in for recall repair.  Was told it was just a software update.  Brought vehicle in was told a part was needed.
Brought the vehicle in service rep took VIN # to schedule appointment.   To not get this done and have to reschedule is frustrating.  It has been a week and have not heard back on status of part.<//review>

Extremely shady dealership.  Bait and switch.  Price was agreed on the phone, 1.5 hour drive to arrive at the dealership and was told car had gps and fancy window treatment they cannot take off.  They even tried to put it on the sales contract hoping I would just sign and not read it. You really think I was born yesterday?  I know there are suckers born every minute but come on!!!   They lost a car sale due to nickle and diming. Went to Roseville Dodge and had a much better experience, very straight forward and no hidden cost, no fine print.</text>

This was a great experience. Jeff "Oz" Oswald treated as if I was family instead of like a person buying a car. He understood my budget and where I needed to be with my payments. Never once did he pressure me to be over my budget, neither did the fiance guy (think his name was Shannon??) I will refer everyone here.< /review>

By all accounts from as far as I could tell the sales department is great there honest, and if your leaving here unhappy the truth is you either didn't listen when making the deal or you shouldn't be buying a car in the first place, I have financed two vehicles here without issue. Also I would like to point out the service staff "For the most part" are also a good group special shout out to a couple tech I know still work there that know there stuff George peck, he's a hell of a mechanic and is honest he won't recommend it if you don't need it. Also he does everything you pay for. And Dave  That being said I realize there is all ways a couple bad eggs in the basket, if you feel you had a bed experience just specifically ask that that same mechanic not work on your cars anymore. I do feel this company did me wrong but that is not here nor there, I am a former employee who was laid off "was told it was due to lack of work" this time. I do believe that over all this is still a reputable company and for the most part is good to do business with.<//Text>

They did amazing job getting my husband a car but when we try to show them that it has hard water stains on the whole car they try and blame it on my husband when the car wasn't even a week old and they didn't clean it at all it was really dirty when we got it, when we were told that it was all cleaned if you buy a car from them make sure you look at the whole car before driving it off the lot.</Review>

<Text>I love my car.  However, the service center at this dealership is a joke.  Pathetic. Unethical and sleazy. Evasive. This is not hyperbole; I am not exaggerating. Under no circumstances would I recommend buying a car here because they can't and won't support it.  Specifics: brought my car (less than 10k miles in) for repair - they *started off* the conversation by telling me they probably wouldn't be able to resolve my issue - that something that was happening *while a service writer watched* "probably wouldn't be" diagnosed and fixed. Instead I got an earful about how "hard" it was to fix FCA cars "these days." Well, they were right, issue wasn't resolved! Instead, they broke something else.  And went silent - they won't respond. The service manager refuses to return calls and won't respond to emails.  Ditto whoever is running their social media.  They even refused to work with the national DodgeCares Twitter account after I contacted them for help. Really!  Amazing (at least to me) but true. I have extensive documentation of all of this and more!  I stand behind every word I'm writing, I'm happy to share copies of everything. When I have time, we're gonna have a conversation in front of a judge.  Find another dealer.
Post script update a week later: as you can see, several days have passed and the dealer hasn't responded; because what can they say? I can tell you that they haven't reached out privately either. This should tell you everything you need to know.<//Text>< user>

I bought a 2016 Subaru from Lodi dodge I drove it for a week I got a ticket for my ex system that came with the car when I bought it I called the dealer and they told me it's my responsibility cost me $1500.00 drove it for approximately two months the engine blew up When I bought the car I was told the car had a factory warranty  on it so I did not buy an extended warranty so when the engine blew up I had it tow to Subaru they checked it out and I was told it needed an engine and it would not be covered under the factory warranty And the reason why was it had aftermarket parts on it I call the dealer and talk to the GM He told me that it's not their responsibility I bought the car with those parts on it  The dealer told me that I could put those parts on so what I did I got a hold of the original owner I talk to him he told me that he install those parts when he owned the car so after the car been with Subaru for two months It cost me $8000 plus a rental car for over 2 months and the general manager will not even talk to me about it it's really sad they would treat the customers this way I could not make the payments on the car and pay for the engine so I got three months behind on my payment so I could pay for the engine and kept the car stay away from this Dealer<//Text>

Went in "just to look around"...Mike the Sales Rep was patient, answered all my questions, and made me feel very relaxed and didn't put pressure on me to drive off the lot with a car. I appreciate that... thank you Mike. Jimmy in the finance dept had us walking out confident in our decision to make our purchase without regret. Great place to stop and look around! Highly recommend Lodi CDJR.</review>

We had a check engine light issue and they took us in right away.  It took several days since they had to order the parts.  When th parts came in, they realized they only had one but before calling us, they called around to other dealers and the tech picked up the part on his way home and installed it the next day.  Raymond, our Service Advisor, and Cliff, the technician were fantastic to deal with.  Thank you.<//review>

Been dealing with a salesperson an one of his managers trying to help me in a rough spot current repo an super bad credit score told me to bring in 6k I said okay then I found out they have a current cash allowance/ incentive I was simply asking if it could be applied to the downpayment I was told no even whe. It could be they would have to work a deal to try to make it happen but no one tried and was talked to with disrespect the salesman did great but his manager was rude and didn't wanna even try his best to help in anyway an told me " I cant help you" now I BBN you want the current dollar days deal you wont get it cuz once tax title an license comes out you dont see the incentive/rebate and when you ask them to try an see if the bank would even take it they refuse   will be making a YouTube video on this bad situation and go from there and explain incentives on

Owner took the low road ban bashes my credit score because I called to explain my review an why I gave a 1 star very disrespectful when a customer gets yelled at by your sales manager who didnt TRY TO HELP BUT TOLD YOU HE DID AND THE GENERAL MANAGER GETS ON   THE PHONE DOWN TALKING SOMEONE NOT KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT THEM AN HANGS UP IN THERE FACE THAT SHOWS BAD LEADERSHIP</text>

Service extremely lacking. No call back as promised. I've received better service from a used car lot. My big thanks for buying two vehicles in one week from these people. Never again. I try to keep my money in Lodi but I'm never going back to this joke of a dealership.</Review>

I WILL NOT RECOMMEND DO NOT GO HERE.
The service of this facility does not even come close to the need of recieving a star. (Negative STAR needed)
The service department is filled with COMPLETELY RUDE and ARROGANT people.
Even the manager I spoke to was rude and disrespectful.
Buy a Jeep ELSEWHERE.
I WILL NOT RECOMMEND Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram, 1255 Beckman Rd, Lodi, CA 95240

Lodi Dodge went above and beyond for me to get my truck taken truck care of.  Tom the service rep is a great guy and kept me informed on how my truck was doing.  I was out of town for work while my truck was in the shop but I knew I did't need to worry because I knew it was in good hands.  I recommend Lodi to everyone both for sales and service.< /Text>

<review>1st experience dropping my car off and the service advisor Tom locks my keys in the car by pushing the lock button and shutting door with my keys inside. I picked up my car a week after dropping it off due to needing a torque clutch converter that was under warranty. I get it back and a few days later a faulty job on the converter caused it to lose all the transmission fluid while sitting in my drive way. They had it towed and fixed that.  I have been hesitant to drive it since. Noticed the hood was not shut all the way. I opened it and found dealer tools in my engine compartment. They called me and wanted to buy the vehicle back, I can see why now. They wanted their tools back with out taking responsibility for leaving them in my engine. Im dissatisfied with my whole experience.< /review><date>1537735970135</date><gmapID>0x80907556a3630431:0x5c93fc37952563b2</gmapID>< user_id>

<Review>Do not bring your car here to be repaired!!!! This place is a joke. You will get charged for "work" that was never even done.... they were supposed to repair my seat got it back in worse condition than before and charged my warranty place for an entire new seat that they admitted was never even ordered..... kept my car for days... never aligned my car.... when my car was finally ready went to pick it up and they said they would leave my car unlocked and put the key under the seat.... HA yeah they locked my damn keys in the car and I had to wait an hour outside with my daughter and fiance for the locksmith to show up to get my keys out. Worse experience I have ever had... the sales people there do seem nice it's the service area that is a joke.< /Review><Pictures>None</Pictures><response>None</response>< GmapID>

<Text>The only thing that was good about my experience with this dealership was the deal on the car I bought. The salesman didnt care about any questions or concerns I had once he knew I was sold on the car, if I hadn't needed a car so badly I'd have walked out. When I bought the car it had a plastic trunk liner, they had the car derailed and it was gone when I came to pick up the car. I have brought it to their attention 3 times and keep gett ing brushed off. Just a heads up to anyone looking to buy a car here they're not looking for your satisfaction past the moment you purchase.<//Text></record>

<text>If you want to over pay for a new or used car, come here! Only dealer I’ve been to that is completely unwilling to “deal” with the customer. I had Andy as a salesman and he and the sales manager were unwilling to lower the sticker price on a brand new vehicle! I’ve bought many cars and EVERY dealer drops the sticker price because they all know it’s marked up so they can make the most money, even when they “do you a favor” and drop the selling price. I would never suggest anyone to go here and I will never return.<//text>< Pics>

Update.....
Not only did i email Terry before posting on here, with no response, but he responded to my review to contact him. Which, I tried again twice, and still have not heard any response in almost a week. Somehow this does not surprise me. Maybe contacting Dodge themselves might help....

Worst experience ever! Was called derogatory names when I said i wanted to go get my pink slip to my old truck and my check book for the deposit. Emailed the manager and never got a response. Very happy with my Chevy i ended up purchasing elsewhere. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!</Review>

< Review>
The service tech Sara was the best part of this experience. The rest of the experience was less than stellar. From the service cashier who could not be bothered with my questions to the fact that it took 2 days just to get someone to look at my truck before even starting work to the over inflated cost of the repair. I thought Lodi CDJR was under new management? Nope, same story just a different book cover.< /Review>

Wouldn't let me give no stars so had to do one star just to post. Very upset with this dealership. Took my Jeep in to have the tow package activated and go pick it up they say it's all good. Get it home and no lights for the trailer. Take it back and they want to charge me again just to look at it. Don't go here drive the distance to go somewhere else<//Text>

My boyfriend and I originally went to Lodi cdjr just to get an idea of what we wanted, but Shannon was so great and helpful and gave us a lot of information to work with that we came back a day or two later to get the truck! Juan helped us do all the paperwork and made everything quick and easy. I definitely recommend Lodi cdjr!<//Text>

Each time I go in he belittles me. I know my car, I keep excellent records of all services done ( by me or by the dealership) He made the comment he's not use to women knowing about the mechanics of a car. ( this is where I lay into him ans tell him I am a Mechanics daughter was taught how to work on cars before I could even reach the pedals! ) and this time as I was walking out of the service department he whistles and mumbled something in Spanish. I've heard how he is with female costumers VS the males. Don't be so sexist with your customers.

Tom was super helpful. I bought a Chrysler aspen from a small dealer in sac. Shady place gave me keys that didn’t work. The key faub had a short in it so when they replaced the batteries and it worked I drove it home. Fast forward to the next morning the key doesn’t work again. Couldn’t lock the doors for a week. Called Tom, he ordered me new keys and I drove it down for him to program them. Easy peasy, out on the road in thirty minutes. Thanks Tom!!!< /text>

DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THIS DEALERSHIP! THEY ARE EXTREMELY NICE WHEN YOU FIRST BUY THE CAR. THE NIGHTMARE BEGINS THE NEXT DAY WHEN THEY CALL YOU BACK IN. THE DEAL WE MADE THE NIGHT BEFORE WON'T WORK WITH THE BANK. SO, THEY GIVE YOU ANOTHER CONTRACT AND SAY THIS IS THE BEST THEY CAN DO. YOU TAKE IT BECAUSE YOU WANT THE CAR. THEN TWO DAYS LATER, THEY CALL YOU AGAIN AND SAY YOU OWE THEM MONEY BECAUSE YOUR TRADE IN LENDER MADE A MISTAKE ON THE PAYOFF. IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE I GOT A PAYOFF QUOTE STANDING THERE IN THE DEALERSHIP AND GAVE IT TO THE SALESMAN. IN REALITY, THE DEALERSHIP WROTE THE WRONG PAYOFF BUT WON'T TAKE THE BLAME. I GO IN AND DROP OF THE CHECK TO THE GENERAL MANAGER AND TELL HIM I WON'T BUY ANOTHER CAR FROM THEM AGAIN AND WALK OFF. AS I'M WALKING AWAY HE'S CALLING ME BUDDY AND TELLING TO WAIT. SO, I STOP TO LISTEN AND ALL HE WANTED TO DO WAS TELL ME NOT TO COME BACK AGAIN AND STORMED OFF. WORTHLESS!</review>

They are the worst dealers i have ever dealt with. I went to check out a used car there and found out that the listed price on their website is incorrect. They wanted to sell this car to me almost 3k higher than listed on their website. On top of everything their manager Jimmy was rude to us.<//Text>

<Review>Salesperson lied. Now I find out the finance company didn’t agree with the terms but will agree to modified terms that were sent to the dealer. Called the dealer and was transferred to the finance department. No answer twice. Receptionist said they are busy and get back with me right away. Over an hour and a half and still waiting.< /Review><Name>James Stombres</Name><time>1532825457835< /time></record></dataset><record>

I went in  for my regular oil change are usually take it in every 3 to 4 months and this time that I took it in my car was there for over three hours after they told me that they were going to do a tire rotation and in oil change and after the third time of me calling to see if my car was ready for pick up they said that they did not do the  tire rotation because I needed new tires and an alignment, mind you this is a brand new car (2016 )and I’ve had less than a year.I am curious as to why they never did a tire rotation on any of my other for oil changes and why my car was there so long for an oil change I’m not happy with the service and I most likely will not be bringing my car back.< /Review>

Terrible experience, recently purchased a brand new 2917 Chrysler 300 in October and it has been in the shop over 5 times now for the same issues over and over.  This past visit I was able to bring in 2 videos of the separate issues as they occurred and the generic response I get it “we can’t duplicate it”.   Smh terrible service, any other dealer I’ve dealt with in the past would’ve held onto the car until it was fixed.  They would’ve trouble shooter with other local dealers and mechanics, but instead it’s in and out.  If car isn’t replaced or bought back I will be taking legal action under CA LEMON LAW.<//Text>

<review>HORRIBLE dealership .

We were getting ready to head towards a dodge dealership in gilroy cause they offered us a deal , Lodi called me and said they’d match it .

We drive an hour to Lodi , they offered us a payment 230 dollars more than what we were offered from the other dealership . He basically chuckled and said it’s not possible for us to get something cheaper . Mind you , this was a 3 year lease with 740 credit score .

It was too late for us to drive to gilroy so we went to Manteca , they offered us 520 a month , 3 year lease and the process took only an hour . On a 2019 scatpack with 3 Miles . They told us 630 for a 2018 scatpack with 200 Miles .

I suggest you guys head over to Manteca dodge instead . I hope the manager and finance guy from Lodi sees this .< /review>< Pics>

<user_id>117171525266158935755<//user_id><text>Called this dealership about a car I wanted the salesman was nice enough on the phone so I told him when I would be down, I didn't expect him to know me or run out on the lot, but no one came out to greet me as I walked all around the lot,(that never happens at any dealership that I have been too, that should have been a red flag) So I called the salesman on his cell phone and he told me the car I wanted was on hold, the car ended up being on hold for 3 days when supposedly they don't do that. They sold the car, but I found another at a different dealership. The two stars is for the salesman for his follow-up; the dealership and its management get zero stars. Based on the few reviews posted this place is hit or miss.<//text>< Rating>

My pickup had to be washed twice. The first time it was returned covered in greasy smudges and the windows were smeared.
The previous times it was in for serice I was charged $10 for the tire rotations. This last time I was charged $25 for the rotation. Not sure if it's due to new ownership.</Text><Response>None</Response></record>

My 2000 Cirrus is a garage sitter & occasional short trip taker. It has 34000 miles on it & when it requires service or any other mechanical attention I leave my vehicle in the qualified hands of Chrysler certified mechanics Lodi CDJR. If I have anything done to my vehicle it is going to be done by a mechanic that specializes in Chrysler. Lodi CDJR is honest, reputable & serves their customers with courteous, professional service which has a touch of personal care incorporated with the manner in which their customers are valued...   ;~)</Review>

A job that should take 5 min took all day and I never got a straight answer on what they did to determine that in fact they were both bad. Charged me 160.00 dollars to do a safety check. What a joke that is. They said they checked my brakes but they never took the wheels off and I have drumb brakes. How do you see through the wheels I would like to know. Also the guy helping me was not a help at all. Ramirez at Lodi dodge never answered my calls and made me wait once I got there for 30 min to sign some paperwork. Then I had to wait while they had to go find my truck. Terrible!!!< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures><Response>None< /Response>< Gmap_id>

<Review>Horrible experience with the service dept. We have taken our 2017 Ram 5 times to fix the windshield wipers from coming on by themselves. We ended having to take the fuse out to drive the truck around. The 5th time it was in their service dept for 5 days. They called us to pick up. when we got it, The fuse was still in the same spot where we left it and once we put it in, sure enough the windshield wipers turned on and we couldn't turn them off. How are they going to keep our truck for almost a week and not fix a damn thing.. I wouldn't never recommend this place it to anyone.<//Review>< resp>

<Text>I did not have a good experience with you guys. When I picked up my car from having a new PC put in it there were some things wrong with my car and I was told that nothing could be done to fix them. & I don't understand why not because my car was fine when it got towed there, despite the PC, and when I got my car about a month later my air bag light was on, my back seat was lifted up not latched down like it was before, also when whoever had to get my door open with a wire or whatever because somebody lost my car keys they messed up the weather stripping in between my car door because water leaks through now. And my door handle was broke throughout the process of my car being there which I was called back there to get the door handle put on but somebody ordered the wrong one and it has been at least another 2-3 weeks that my car door handle has been broken. I am not a happy customer.<//Text>< pics>

Bad customer service, I purchased a Jeep Patriot 6 months ago from Daniel Ochoa. The car wasn't driving well and I brought it back to the dealership the same day I drove it off the lot and he told me to bring it in and services will take care of it. Went there on two different occasions without appointment they couldn't look at the car let alone fix it because they didn't have technicians for that time, i made two other appointment I finally got the car in today and I was told I have an extended warranty that don't cover the problem and I have to pay out-of-pocket $500 plus to get it fixed worst part is I spoke to sales manager Eric and he is the worst customer service person I have ever come across in my life he actually told me none of this was in writing. Apparently nobody put this in their system and mention that the car had a problem from the jump when I got it and that I had been there three different times with no solution to this and mr. Ochoa don't work there anymore (bad news for me, Great for them) and this Eric of a manager had the nerve to say he cannot say if I'm telling the truth about the car having this problem when I bouhgt it so there is nothing he can do about it..DON'T BUY FROM THEM..Ridiculous customer service and dishonest people.</Text>

At the beginning very friendly and kind stuff. But when the things go rough everything changed. My brand new 2018 charger begin to shake badly afther 20 minutes  left the dealer and when l call them they just told me to go to the nearest dodge service. And that was my last talk with them.
Afther that , from the sales person to the sales manager and general manager nobody answer or return to my calls.
Also , when l check my purchase details l found a different for.2.820 Usd over charged to my total amount. Than l learn from the finance manager that he add 1.370 Usd for GPS trucking system together with windshield protection. ( In the beginning he said the GPS is coming with the car together and never mention for any price or payment )
And 1.450  Usd for 6 years mechanical coverage. . ( l reject all the additional insurance and coverage offers from the finance manager while the signing process but still add the coverage. )
Afther talk couple of times with the second finance manager ( l couldn't reach to the first one as expected ) he said that l will get back the mechanical coverage and windshield protection but the GPS can not removed from the car....
İ am 58 years old and change my car every 3 - 4 years and this was my worst worst experience ever..< /Text>

Summer of 2017 (June)
Dodge caravan was misfiring really bad. Took it to dodge and they put a left cylinder head in my caravan keeping it for couple weeks and costing $3200. Took it home and found filter air box and wires were loose and not secured properly on and around the manifold. 8k miles later cylinder head was leaking oil.
Summer 2018 (June)
Took it back to dodge and the said yes it is leaking they will order head gasket kept van for a week. Service dept. Calls me and tells me camshaft also needs to be replaced i give a go ahead which is another $290 for camshaft and 6 rocker arms and 6 tappets. Got it back on saturday evening and found airbox and all the wires loose again and couple of metal brackets. Was very upset sent videos to the dealership rightaway and they said they will make sure my advisor gets the videos on Monday. But on sunday i take van for a drive and it felt like misfiring again at a red light and while driving. I got back in dodge and told em its heating up after the rework and getting only 16 miles to a gallon when it always had been getting over 17 in city and also misfiring. They send a tech with me on a drive. Engine did shutter i could feel it but tech sitting in the back seat could not (van does not have front passenger seat or middle row). It has loss of power i told them and i can clearly tell. I told tech my van and advisor my was leaking oil from cylinder head but atleast it was running fine and after rework now on cylinder this engine is not the same anymore. They said we will hook it up and see if there is a misfire. Nothing else we can do because we worked on the cylinder head. I said yes you took all apart and worked on the cylinder head and might have missed something when putting everything back. I am a regular driver of the van so i know when van is not acting right.  Advisors are nice but techs don't know what they are doing. It is too much headache. Trust me stay away from lodi dodge service depts. Its been nothing but pain. I am stuck with a broken van if they dont fix this sudden engine sutter/thumping issue. What makes dodge think after after missing work for 3 weeks, repais costing over $3600 and stress about van that i will come back to them for service?
JUNE2018
Dodge said they could not any misfiring symptoms etc. and maybe a ignition coil pack going bad. They give van back to me...
JULY2018
Only after 8 days  and less than 1000 miles later van was back at the dealership it was leaking oil from the cylinder head again 😔. Tom advisor said leave it and we will look at it. Next day Tuesday tom calls me and tells me they will order a whole new cylinder head and crysler said part is back ordered and estimate arrival date for part is July 31 2018. I said thats almost 3 weeks😤😟. Advisor also said that's not a guarantee they'll have the part on that date.
JULY 30 2018
i call dealership to get an update... Advisor said they got the part and tech is working on the van as we speak. I said ok good thanks.
JULY 31 2018
i get a call from advisor that they were putting cylinder head in and a chunk of block came in techs hand. He said bolts threads came out and now van needs a new Motor.  He said dealership spoke to chrysler and Chrysler said they will cover Labor cost to put in new motor but not cover the new motor. Tom said new motor is $5800 and the 2nd option is to trade in this vehicle for another vehicle. Really Dodge? 😠 I said Tom i have missed 6 weeks of my work so far from June 2017 to July 2018 because of dealership keeping the van. I have spent over $3600 and problem is still not fixed and on top of that dealership messed up the engine and chrysler is asking me to pay for motor? And not to mention the stress i took every time they keep the vehicle and i miss work. I have lost clients and am at the brink of losing my job. I said dealership took it apart 3 times in those 3 visits i made so far,  they should cover everything. Tom said i will tell my boss and they will be the one making the call. 8/14/2018 They made me pay for used LKQ motor $2441.61 :(</text><pics>None< /pics><Response>{'time': 1530557235847, 'text': "We're discouraged to see that you've faced numerous issues with your van and our team is working its hardest to make sure all these issues are resolved.

<Review>Lack of personality and very unclear on their process of selling a car. The sales man didn't  seem interested in selling, no effort or personality. The sales manager very unprofessional I have never came across these problems while car buying seem like they were trying really hard to rip me off or not even make the sell. I'm probably buying my car somewhere else.</Review><Name>Marcos Bucio</Name></record>

<Text>DON'T go here for service. I brought my perviously owned Jeep Wrangler here for a general service check. First I wanted them to see why the traction lights wouldn't go off. Additionally, I wanted them to check the brakes and any other issues they might find. They ended up "resetting" the traction lights, changed the oil and transmission fluid. Was told the brakes were fine. $500.00 later we left. The next day the traction lights came back on, was told I could return in about a week for another appointment.  Two months later and approximately 200 miles the brakes started to grind, took it to Les Schwab and we ended up having to replace all four routers and brake pads! Additionally, we were made aware of 3 recalls that Lodi never told us about. I recently took it to Carson City Jeep for the recalls and they informed me the water pump was bad, the oil pan was leaking and the recall took care of the traction lights. There was NO way Lodi could reset the traction lights because there was a faulty part that the recalls took care of. Thanks to Carson City Jeep My Jeep now runs great!!  THANKS FOR NOTHING LODI JEEP!!!   I like to spend my money locally, but I will NEVER return to this service department again. If I could I would give them zero stars</Text>< Pics>

<review>Honestly I wouldn’t come here and do business with Lodi Dodge again.... I rather go to a different dealership. The person “ helping” me  didn’t even have the time to let me speak. Everything was rushed, they say what you want to hear but don’t be fooled. I asked the sales person and the finance manager if I would have to contact the dmv for anything after trading in my car, they said no so I would confident of not having to worry about the dmv sending me anything later in the mail about the  old car.... BUT nope, a month and two weeks later I got a letter saying I need to renew my car registration “ the car I traded in” even though I signed off that car I still got this notice. I read on the DMV that I have to fill out a form out and I tried but didn’t have the option of trading in the car info so I contacted the sales person that helped me and told me “ it happens all the time no worry I’ll have my person send you a copy” later on that day got a message saying they weren’t able to get the copy for whatever reason so I called the next morning and talked to the finance manager and told me I should just ignore it, it happens all the time and I don’t need to contact them about it but HE WILL SEND ME A COPY OF RELASE OF LIABILITY... a couple of hours passed by and still didn’t get a copy sent to my email. Waited until the next day mid day and messaged and called  the  person  who “ helped “ me and no response. This place is very unprofessional and deserves  zero stars.</review><response>None</response><date>1524692621586< /date>< name>

<Text>I am very pleased with my experience here at Lodi Dodge. I am originally from Stockton, and had a horrible experience at my Dodge location. I looked around online, and came across Lodi Dodge, and I am very happy I did! This location has a wide variety of cars, new and used. The salesmen, and mangers here are very nice and respectful, unlike Stockton. My husband and I been eyeballing the Dodge Durango’s for awhile now. They have a good selection here, and my husband really liked the black one. The salesman let us test drive the car, and we got to experience the Durango’s full potential. Having a toddler, and a 3 months old baby, we needed to upgrade to a bigger car immediately. The vehicle is very spacious, and accommodates my children’s car seats and strollers perfectly, and still has A LOT of space left. We are pleased to say the Durango best fits my family, and our needs. After going over some numbers, our salesman, Jose Delgado, got to work things out for us, and got us approved for a good deal on the Durango. Jose was very nice and straight forward. I am happy to say we came here looking for a Durango, and left with one the same night. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone, Jose Delgado, and the rest of his team, are very professional and nice. My family will be doing more business with them in future for sure. Thank you Lodi Dodge!</Text>< Date>

I recieved great Service from Raymond Ruiz at Lodi Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram. I came in for an  air bag recall, and they inspected the vehicle for other problems, and discoved that the front brakes were severely worn. Since I had just purchased the Jeep from Carmax the week before, Raymond suggested that I bring it back to them for service. I have scheduled an appointment with Carmax. Thanks for the great service and attention to detail Raymond.<//Text>

<Rating>1< /Rating><Review>Very disappointed . I took the car in to have keys programmed and was given a quote for 80$. The estimate said customer understands that there is no guarantee the fobs would work since they weren't bought from them. Ok I can deal with that... Left the car there overnight and get a call that the keys aren't programming with the car. They tell me it's 165$ to run a diagnostic to see if the computer modules bad and asked how much this would run me if it was the module.she says about $365. Later after they did the diagnostic I get call saying yup the module is bad, and I the total to repair was just over $1100, don't want to proceed,?. And that and I had to decline for now. When I go to pick up the car, it's $245 to get my car back and im told I'm being charged the 80 for the attempt to program the keys plus diagnosis. Now wheree did it say customer understands or acknowledges if the key doesn't program I still have to pay $80. I was already having to pay the diagnostic of bad news  The female who acts like she's running  the place was not helpful nor very friendly, when I asked about this she said there was nothing she could do, that whether or not it was programmable she had to pay the guy who tried. I asked to speak to the manger only to be told he was off , how on Earth can u charge someone for a service you didn't get without disclosing this could happen? Can you imagine if I would have said ok to go ahead and replace the computer module going wit the earlier quote  of 365.00? And been then be told I'd have to pay 1200+ when I showed up for my car??! I'm livid that I had to pay 240 to walk away with nothing . I'll never use this dealership in the future and you have been forewarned. Price gouged and no disclosures.</Review>< pictures>

I went in to get a diagnostic test done to find out whats wrong with my truck. I asked how much and if they would find and report the problem. The guy wrighting up tag yes to if theres a problem that it will be found and reported, cost would be 160.00. The next day the guy calls me and said were going have to run a compression test for another 500.00 dollars to figure whats wrong.my reply was,"so your telling me 660.00 dollars then you possibly still wouldn't be able to tell me whats wrong? He's reply was yes. I say thats not what you told me and im comeing to pick my truck up. I pick my truck up and the paperwork was changed from the original to benefit the guy that wrote it up with rearrange words to benefit him or i should say the dealership. And i still had to pay 160.00 for not one thing that they did but lies. I strongle beleave they dident even look at it. Due to there inspection reported said a bunch of things that were lies. Like i neede a new air filter, and a major service and flush on tranny. Less then a mo. Before i changed the filter and 2 filters/fluid in tranny. I bet there hasent been one elderly lady that hasent been taken addvantage of ...... I no was ripped off. And lied to.

I have bought 2 vehicles from Lodi CDJR. in the last 6 months.  I will continue to but from them.  There GREAT!!!  All so nice.  Ask for Marty Stevens for sales and Mike for finace, Their both very good at their jobs.
Marty won't waste your time, tell him exactly what your looking for and he will do the work of looking for the right vehicle for you.  Than Mike will get you through finance in a record breaking time.  So if your time is valued to you go to Lodi CDJR. and get what you want.
Have a GREAT day!!!

Was planning on heading to Lodi Dodge this morning to trade-n my current Ram 2500 for a new one... But these reviews have me a bit scared... Hate giving other cities my tax dollars but sounds like not much of a choice... Hopefully Lodi Dodge will improve their customer service by the time I'm ready for my next truck...< /text>

What can I say about this place. 2 words IT SUCKS. I was dealing with the internet fleet sales manager Marty Steve's. I saw an ad for the vehicle I wanted and asked Marty I want it for that price. Marty said yeah I can give it to you for that price but you have to come today. So I did and guess what Marty made false promises. I also waited there 5 hours to sign paperwork and Marty was jumping back and fourth customers and was being unprofessional about leaving me alone minutes at a time. He even told me go pick a vehicle within the price range of what I was looking for and he could work something out for me. I wasted my time. He didn't do squat for me. Absolutely nothing. All a sales tactic. People if you are reading other reviews it's true this place is horrible. Marty your customer service sucked. You asked me to write a good review for you but how can I? I'm not a liar like you. You lie for living and I get it but someday you will answer to someone right? Hope you feel good about it now. Anyways while waiting hours to see the finance manager all Marty talked about was his personal life how his wife left him and he barely sees his kid. I have a family to man and you guys really left me dry for a while before I got out of there. Oh and Marty you guys are not the cheapest in California for that Ram tradesman I bought just a another sales pitch lie though right? Maybe that's why your ex left you. Just saying. When i finally got with the finance manager my interest rate that we shook hands on Marty on a 3.5 percent didn't even happen but i shouldnt be surprised by another lie right Marty? Also the finance manager was pressuring me to buy extended warranty I mean so much pressure I almost said yes but thank God I said No! That Assyrian guy should be lucky i forgot his name or id be bashing you here to. You pressured me like 30 times to get extended warranty and you even mentioned that you could drop my interest rate if I were to get it. I did a lot of research you do know your tactics are illegal correct. Telling me my interest would get better with extended warranty is illegal that really should be a fireable offense. Oh by the way if your reading this review they add an additional 895 to your costs for the tracking of the vehicle. They will tell you it's included or a free service but it is NOT. Also they forgot to give my ID back to me. MARTY FORGOT IT IN THE COPIER. How unprofessional is that. I got lucky though he took it home with him but I still had to drive 20 miles to his house to pick it up lucky me but he also left the key tracker with me which I also returned to Marty. People if you are still reading my review don't do business with Marty he's been lieing to customers for 20 something years. I know he's been there 20 years cause all he did was brag about it. Do yourself a favor go somewhere else. Seriously these people will do you wrong. Wish I wouldn't have jumped the gun but it is what it is I can only learn from it and let others know. Take your business elsewhere please.</Text>

In 2003, I bought my new Jeep Grand Cherokee from a different dealership on this lot.  I have only 56K miles on my Jeep to date.  I do a lot of my own service because of bad and poor experiences in the past.  The experience I have had at Lodi CDJR is one just as bad if not worse.  I originally took my Jeep in on 8/6/16 to have the air bag recall performed and to get an estimate for a check engine light.  (smog related).  For my jeep when it comes to smog issue, I want factory parts. Lodi CDJR furnishes a courtesy shuttle. (I need to rely on the courtesy vehicle because my Jeep is our only vehicle)  My Jeep was ready that day for pickup  (parts were ordered and I needed the vehicle ). I asked if the shuttle could pick me up. I was asked what time. I said 1 o'clock. They agreed.  I waited until 2:30 to call the dealer asking where my ride was. I was told they were just leaving.  I brought my Jeep in first thing Monday morning and got a ride home on the shuttle. At around 11:30 I was called saying my Jeep was ready.  I said I needed a ride. I was told they do not have anyone available at this time. They would call me when they did.  I waited until almost 3:30. I called the dealership back. I was told they just found someone that could get me. Then I waited another 45 minutes for the ride.  When I picked up my Jeep my front passenger door window was down about 4 inches and would not go up or down. Ended up being a repair I would have to do. They would not repair unless I paid to have it repaired.  All the windows were up when I left my vehicle that morning. My thought  is someone slammed the door that broke the cable on the regulator. The next day I tried no less than 6 times to call Robert, the service manager, who was always busy or not in. The operator told me I needed to leave  him a voice mail with my name and number and he would call me back. I left Robert  a voice mail with my name and number on 8/9/16 . I AM STILL WAITING AND IT IS MONDAY THE 15TH. Robert don't waste my time now with a phone call. My Jeep is a 2003 with low miles and very clean, at no time during any of the work being done was my seat covered with plastic to protect the vehicle seat from the dirty clothes of the mechanics.  My Jeep now gets 13.7 miles per gallon, it was getting 18.2 miles per gallon before they worked on it.  I will never buy, recommend or have any work done on any of my vehicles at Lodi CDJR.  I was thinking of buying a new Grand Cherokee Jeep and pass this one to one of my grand kids. If I do it will not be from this dealership.
For the mileage problem I found the cover from the air cleaner to the top of the fuel injection installed wrong. I reinstalled the cover and retrained the computer and now I have my good mileage back.  It is really to bad when the customer has to repair what the professionals work on. My personal recommendation use caution and think twice before dealing with Lodi CDJR.</Text>

<Review>Andy is the worst sales person on the planet. He will lie to you and waste your time. Go to any other dealership if possible. If you go here to purchase a vehicle you will have the a terrible experience. This piece of crap had me bring my wife and two year old to the dealership after he lied to my face.< /Review>< pics>

(1) your service department, charged me more than my $100 00 repair deductible, approved by my insurance company.

(2) your finance department did not disclose a complete purchase order, price amount to my Credit Union, for the purchase price on the 2018 Dodge, 350 pickup I was trying to buy.

(3) Your finance manager/Department caused (3) Credit report hits that has now damage my credit score..... I was told there would be only (1) hit....</text>

Customer service is horrible. Paid $160 for them to tell me exactly the same thing i told them was wrong with my car. Then took it to another shop and they said the part they wanted to replace was ok and didnt need replacing. Almost cost me $2300.<//text>

Don't believe they have low prices or specials. Its just a way to get you into see if they can get you to buy something else. And they don't tell you that you have 5 year windshield repair added to the contract< /text>

(Translated by Google) I do not like this place for the reason that to convince you they speak beautifully to you but once they sell you the car and they are no longer responsible if it is defective first or if in a few words they do not care they sell and now. The truth is that they do not fit the truth, I do not recommend because I am sorry to buy a truck from that place, now they made me feel like a fraud, I am not going to take care of me, do not happen the same

(Original)
Ese lugar no me gusta por la razón de que para convencerte te hablan bonito pero una vez que ya te venden el automóvil y ya no se asen  responsable si es defectuoso de primero o si en pocas palabra no les importa ellos venden y ya. no entran razón a nada  la verdad yo no recomiendo porque  yo estoy arrepentido de comprar una troca de ese lugar ahora me isieron sentir  como un fraude   voy nadien me ase caso cuidado no pasen lo mismo<//review>
