Everyone at the front desk was helpful, friendly, and professional. They made the process for me quick and easy. Their response time was super fast for both my emails and calls.
I have nothing wrong to say about my experience with Arbors so far. The environment is clean, quiet, and welcoming.
Alena couldn’t have made this process any easier or faster for me. It was great. Thanks, Alena!
The Arbors is in a beautiful, secure location near both the shopping centers and the freeway.<//text><pics>None<//pics><Rate>5<//Rate></record></dataset><record>

I moved into a renovated one bedroom, on May 20th and I couldn't be any happier! I have the hard wood floors I've always wanted! My move in went seamlessly, the office staff welcomed me in from day one. I am so excited to call this place my new home!!

REVISING THIS ON 8/3/19: I still am in LOVE with my apartment. Rent is super easy to pay since they have an online payment option. They are revamping the complex and repainting all the exteriors! They are giving the main pool are make over. I'm so excited to bring my friends to the pool once it's done! Daniel in the leasing office is amazing! I went in to the office today because I was having difficulties with my renters insurance and needed some clarification. He walked me through the entire thing with such patience (because I'm sure I was driving him nuts with my millions of questions). He was so sweet and genuine the entire time. Maintenance is great here too! My AC started to leak just a little from using it so often. I called the office and they had Miguel, the maintenance technician, over to my apartment in less that 5 minutes. He was extremely sweet, patient, and thorough. My AC was fixed in 15 minutes and hasn't leaked since.

I'm just so happy here!<//review>< pictures>

I moved in about a month ago and have had a really good experience so far! My screen door was hard to open but the maintenance man came and fixed it within a couple days! Elena at the front office is a sweet heart and was so helpful through out the process! If you have questions, ask for her!< /Text>

This place is not safe for vehicles, and the management does not care what happens to you.  We moved here in late December within a month the catalytic converter to our car was stolen.  We reported it to the office hoping they would fix the gate (which has been broken since arrived).  They didn't and one month later it was stolen again.  This happened in our designated parking spot.  We reported it to management and they pretty much responded with a shrug and said it could have happened anywhere. Do not rent here.  Theft is bad and management won't care or take any actions to improve it.  During the filing of our police report, the officer mentioned that they have to come out to the apartments often for similar incidents.  Do not rent here.  It is not safe and management does not care.  Do not rent here.  It is not safe and management does not care.  Do not rent here.  It is not safe and management does not care.  Is it safe? no.  Does management care? no.<//Review>

<Rating>3<//Rating><text>This is a nice place to live especially if you don't have that much money. I lived here since 2011 and there's been a lot of changes to the building and the whole complex as well as the people too, the building changes were nice its just the people there nowadays who live there are a little rude and quite annoying. As much problems we had with the people here we still enjoyed living here and we watched this old apartment complex grow. We recently moved out because they have been raising the rent quite a bit each year, and it was just this year that they raised it a little too much and we had to move out.<//text>< resp>

I moved in to this complex a year and a half ago. Their office staff is unprofessional, can't even be bothered to answer the phone or process paper work. Taking care of the most basic of maintenance request is non existent. I've had the washer in my unit go unrepaired and leaking all over the floor for over a month. I've had the dryer broken for over a month before they bother to even send a maintenance person to look at it, let alone fix it. I have called and put in countless maintenance requests in their system which just gets marked as completed without the problems being repaired. The buildings are infested with rats including the ventilation system. So if you enjoy breathing in rat excrements or just breathing at all good luck, especially if you have asthma like my roommate does. To top it off, today I come home after working a 16 hour shift in a hot sweaty kitchen. There was no hot running water in my unit, no notification that the hot water was going to be out. I had to call the emergency maintenance number, which they didn't answer like always. Wonder why it even exists. Then I had to proceed to call the main office number which as usual is forwarded to the main call center because no one in the office ever answers the phone. As usual the call center was notified by the leasing office that the hot water would be out but didn't bother notifying the tenants. Long story short, just finished driving an hour round trip to take a shower at my family's home. Don't move here unless you don't need basic daily necessities. They overcharge for rent and still continues to charge their tenants hundreds of dollars for amenities that have been closed the entirety of COVID. Cliche but would give zero stars if I could.</review>

Horrible service. The staff does not care about its renters. I’ve had work orders for months that still aren’t resolved (AC keeps leaking). They towed my wife’s car without any notice because they said it was dirty and had old tags (even though we had the new tags as proof). Avoid this place at all costs.

Addition: note to renter, they will charge for everything in the apartment. Even normal wear and tear doesn’t count.<//review>

<Text>My wife and I were treated terribly at Arbors Cal Oaks. Office staff would complete work orders online, when the issue was not taken care of. Whenever my wife would go to the office to try and resolve an issue, the male gentlemen with glasses would treat her very disrespectfully. Also, whenever we would try to contact the office staff at Cal Oaks, our phone call was always forwarded to the corporate number, who have no clue what's going on at the local sites.

We were left with bees coming through our air vents for a minimum of two weeks before anyone got back to us on what the process would be to getting the issue resolved.

We also had a hole on our balcony for a couple of months where my toddler almost fell down the stairs on numerous occasions.

We received a gate opener for the "gated" community, which were stuck being open for the 2 years we resided there. Not exactly a gated community if the gates are always broken.

The contractors that painted the buildings, didn't take proper precautions and let paint overspray get on our vehicle. Then, their resolution was getting one of their maintenance guys to detail our vehicle rather than getting it professionally detailed...

Besides the terrible office staff, the parking situation is horrific. There isn't enough space for all of the residents there. The laundry facility was never clean and upkept.

I will NEVER recommend this complex to any friends or family. These are NOT luxury apartments.< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<review>I paid the $400 deposit to hold the apartment. I did not get approved which had the wrong information on there credit check I tried to give them documents and tell them somethings are not on any of the real credit bureaus reports they said they could not help me. Then they said what is an address to send a check for the $400 that I would receive it in 21 days. What a joke the lady in charge is rude. When I asked if I could come to pick up the money she never emailed back.<//review><Gmap_id>0x80dc825a513a9497:0x761b6a1e2e61176c</Gmap_id><time>1595399838034< /time><resp>None< /resp><Pics>None< /Pics><userid>116493988403334418412</userid>< username>

Nice office people. The manager was polite and took time to listen to my issues. Nothing was the fault of the apartments but I really felt like Brandy cared about what I had to say and I left feeling much better. Crystal and the leasing girls are so nice and fun to visit. I am very happy living here.<//review>

So happy here. I absolutely love my new home! I moved in 3 months ago and I'm still getting adjusted but so far so good. The office ladies have been incredible with helping me move in, the maintenance team helped unclog my garbage disposal after my son dropped his toy into it (sorry!). I used the pool for the first time last week and I had never felt more relaxed. I take walks around the property just for the beautiful scenery. I still cant believe this is my new home.</Text>

I have lived here for almost two months now and I am so happy with my choice to move in. The office staff, specifically Alena, have been so helpful and great! Maintenance is always cleaning grounds in the morning and all work orders have been solved promptly. The location of these apartments is great, walking distance to shopping, dining, & parks. I am so happy with my choice to move here and would recommend it to anyone!</Review>

2 months after moving out of the Arbors, this company has continued to ignore our inquiries, and refused to return our deposit.

Think twice about leasing here. I will be notifying the city and county of the Arbor’s illegal business practices.</Review>

Do not apply to this property!  Read their reviews under JRK Properties.  JRK owns these units.  I would never get a place that is owned by them.  They scam people out of their deposits, before they move in. They have a $275.00 member ship fee that's at the end of the contract and a verbal 25.00 added to your rent every month for improvements to the complex.  Arena said the $275.00 is an HOA fee.(Lie) There is no ownership here.  There are so many people who never moved in here and paid a deposit that they are fighting to get back.  Do not Believe the Fake 5star reviews.  This place will be in litigation verysoon.< /Review>

<Review>This is the slums of Murrieta. They are scam artist. First they show you only one part of the complex when viewing before renting to you. You supposedly cannot see the unit you are renting until moving in because insurance purposes. We showed up to move in and the unit we signed for looked nothing like the unit they showed us. The bathtubs were nasty and brown in color like they had not been cleaned in a year. The refrigerator was beaten in and 3 different colors, there was no dinning room. I went back to the office and they said they could not give back our deposit because it was nonrefundable,  they showed us another unit that we end up taking. They told us there was on site security and then later sent out an email that do not have security. They advertise that they are gated community 1) there is not gates around the entire property 2) the gates did not work for over 90% of the time that we lived there. They still don't work to this day(I drive by it everyday). Also they claimed they were turning on the utilities in our name which they charged us to do and then you find out the bill is from their main office and not a utility company. They over water the grounds and pay some half hazard grounds keepers that don't clean up anything and then pass those costs on to their tents. We were paying over $160 a month in their fake water bill for a tiny 2 bedroom. I now live in a 3 level 4 bedroom 3 bath townhome less then a mile away and I pay $60 a month in water. Now I found out that they said we owed them money after keeping our deposit, not once did they send a bill, make a phone call or send an email saying we owed them money, now this is on my credit. Arbors you better bet my attorney will be in contact and you will have to prove that you attempted to let us know there was more money owed which you will not be able to do and I will be filing a complaint with the BBB. Run do not walk but run away from these scam artist. I would give them no stars but I can't.  Last the only reason they have over 3 stars is because they bribe their tenants into good reviews by offering free TVs if you put a good review up for them(I still have the proof of these emails).

I got a one bedroom without washer and dryer. The price is affordable for me and my small family. We use the laundry room provided to us and it makes it really easy. Have not yet gotten a utility bill but from what I read I'm not expecting it to be much. Crystal is very nice and can help me with anything because my first language is Spanish. But all the ladies are very nice and helpful too. My kids will like to play in the playground and they have a very nice dog park too. I like that they have a courtesy officer at night for me to call in case of anything. They have someone who also takes care of the ground and picks up trash and cleans up. It's so wonderful here. I really would recommend to everyone who wants a good deal in Murrieta. It's really beautiful here.< /Review>

The staff are friendly, respectful and handle your concerns with care. Shout out to Alena in the office, she is the best!  The maintenance staff respond quickly and professionally to repair request. Arbors is a great place to call home.  P.S. No one bribed me to leave this review, I have lived her for over 2 years and we are very happy. It's unfortunate that others are just that miserable, I wish you all Peasce and happiness.</Review>

Great community my only dislike is having a neighbor with dogs above us.  You can here Fido's footsteps.  Families with pets should have their own separate building. Other than that everything is great< /Review>

Needed a 6 month lease at a cheap rate because Extended Stay hotels were breaking my budget. I found this place online, and booked an appointment to see an apartment. I went over details with an agent, she made it  extremely easy for me to understand how the process would move along. I am now set to move in April 1st. I've driven by a few times at night. From what I observed there seems to be plenty of available parking at night, the building are well lit and it is almost eerie how quiet it is.  The grounds seem to be kept up. The amenities are pretty cool. I can tell I'm going to get a bunch of use out of the pools. You can't get a better deal anywhere else. I feel like I made out on a deal- I'm one happy camper!<//Text>

<text>When we first walked the apartment with Alena the leasing agent she was rude and did not know the basic information of the property. She showed us the apartment I was going to rent which was dirty and not in showing condition. When we received keys and walked the apartment it was filthy and in the bathroom drawer had trash and belongings from previous resident, which she then said she will have housekeeping go and clean it out after they gave us keys. We could not move in until they were done and still apartment was dirty. Within the first week I did laundry and the dryer did not work at all! It would take 5 hours to dry one small load!!!! Maintenance came and “fixed” it and that same day it still took 5 hrs to dry my clothes. They don’t do anything with people dealing drugs, smoking inside the apartments, or taking care of your requests! My dryer still to this day does not work my apartment smells of marijuana and cigarettes and they tell me there is nothing they can do! When I put in my first work order it took them 2 weeks to come out! The office staff is rude and don’t care about their residents! I try and call the office and no one ever answers and I always get directed to their customer service department that does not have anything to do the property directly! I would give them 0 stars if I could! Sadly I only moved here in an a emergency of providing housing for my family.< /text>< time>

<Name>Britny Rios< /Name><Text>Worst experience ever DO NOT RENT HERE.
Parking is HORRIBLE. The service there is absolutely disgusting. We were promised a lot of the new renovations that the showing apartments have. Moved in to our apartment and nothing was like the showings. We were told we would have a patio. We don’t have one. Only thing good here is the maintenance people because they are super nice and always on time. Only reason I’m giving a one star. If not it would be no star at all. This place just tries to get money out of you. We have parking permit stickers, which we pay $20 every month but for what?!? They don’t keep up with that. So basically just paying them $20 monthly for absolutely no reason. They state there’s security there, when a whole year of living here, not once have I seen security. There is a whole bunch of skunks, possum and raccoons here. New thing they started, we have to buy our own lightbulbs, (not a big deal), but the fact that in our utilities bill we are already paying a maintenance fee. Also when we moved into our apartment, there was stains on the carpet, the blinds had Bite marks, the bathroom sink had stains. All in all, I’m Glad to say that my lease is finally over in August.< /Text></record>

Take pictures of everything during your move in & move out process. My son & his girlfriend rented a unit from them. Last June they moved out. They left the unit immaculate!! The assistant manager, Krystal, said everything looked great. However, they managed to sneak in some fees that were questionable. My son & his girlfriend are still trying to get a $50 paint fee back that the manager promised to refund them. It's been 8 months! They've left messages for the manager & corporate. They've sent emails- no one gets back to them.< /text>

So happy here. I absolutely love my new home! I moved in 3 months ago and I'm still getting adjusted but so far so good. The office ladies have been incredible with helping me move in, the maintenance team helped unclog my garbage disposal after my son dropped his toy into it (sorry!). I used the pool for the first time last week and I had never felt more relaxed. I take walks around the property just for the beautiful scenery. I still cant believe this is my new home.<//text>

I love the Arbors! Alena was an absolute pleasure to work with; professional, personable, and always followed up to ensure each step of the move-in process was seamless.

We found The Arbors through craigslist. At first we were skeptical because they were advertising a lower price than all the other complexes in the area. We thought we would call and inquire before making the trip from La Jolla. We spoke with Daniel and he confirmed pricing with us and we scheduled a tour for the upcoming Saturday. Fast forward to Saturday, we show up to our appointment, we meet with Daniel and he shows us a model apartment for the floor plan we were interested in. Of course the model always look immaculate and decorated like the inside of a furniture magazine. We weren't sold yet, it all seemed too good to be true. We asked if he had a vacant apartment that was in showing condition and by coincidence he did! When we finally got to view the final product. We were just as impressed with the vacant apartment than we were with the model apartment. After talking some numbers over with our leasing agent, we decided to take the jump and apply! ANDDDDDDDDD we could not be any happier! We were approved and sent move in costs the very next day and even got to move in the upcoming week. We have been here for about a month so far and it's been smooth sailing. My apartment had new vinyl wood floors and brand new appliances as part of the renovations they are doing. My fiance and I have opted for the one bedroom to save some money and work towards a house in the future. The one bedroom is cozy and such a perfect size for a couple. As far as the overall community of the complex it has all been great as well! The grounds are always picked up and the pools are actually taken care of really well here when compared to other complexes I had toured in the past. The gym is awesome and they have some really good machines available. Oh! and its open 24/7- great for my fiance who has such a  tricky work schedule. Maintenance has been in my apartment a couple times to fix little things here and there and they have all been wonderful too, very courteous and respectful while in my apartment. Overall, I recommend The Arbors and I've even referred a few of my friends and family to the complex. If you're not certain because of all the reviews (yes I read the reviews before I toured!) then go check the place out for yourself and take a tour. I pretty much interrogated Daniel (LOL) with all my questions or concerns (because of the reviews!) and he honestly took my questions like a champ and made me feel good about my decision to apply. If the Arbors team even reads these reviews then thank you to Daniel and the entire team who helped me and my fiance get in so quickly! If anyone has any questions about the complex then just let me know and I would be happy to answer, I'm really happy here!<//Text><gmapID>0x80dc825a513a9497:0x761b6a1e2e61176c</gmapID><Pics>None<//Pics></record></dataset><record>

Worst apartment to stay at. I wouldn't even rate it one star, this place gets no stars. My roommate and I moved in due to work. We kept everything looking brand new moving in and moving out. We talked and informed the office that our work is relocating us and if they could work with us. They said yes or course. Sense they were going to do that we were nice enough to vacuum and steam clean the carpets before we officially moved out, so they could rent the apartment out as soon as possible. That was a big mistake definitely DID NOT work with us.

Management and maintenance are horrible with the tenets, lazy, never fixes anything, just the worst and unprofessional place ever.

We regret ever moving in and trying to work an arrangement with them.<//text>

I know I see a lot of negative reviews about this place and I find it funny because the reviews are all about the people who live here, not the apartments or the staff themselves! These are the most affordable apartments in town, they’re fairly clean and in good condition. The amenities are great and always clean. The girls at the office are nice and make me feel welcome :) I just renewed my

<review>I'm a past resident of The Arbors. I lived for few a couple of years (2016-2018) and I'm regretting EVER leaving. Since I had gotten married, my husband decided he wanted a bigger apartment at another complex. This was the BIGGEST mistake. We moved out of my cozy cute one bedroom at The Arbors and moved into another complex in Temecula. This move has caused so much stress and turmoil on my life. The Arbors felt like home and I'm disappointed I ever left.
I miss:
Walking my dog around the beautiful green property, having Target right across the street from me, being so close to the 15 and 215 freeways (literally 5 minutes away), the friendly staff always greeting me through out the property,  hanging at the pools in the summer time with my friends and family, using the 24/7 fitness center,  my cheap utility bills, running across the street to Barons for a fresh salad, and overall the peace and quiet of the apartment complex. I can not wait for my current lease to be over where I'm at now just so I can re apply at The Arbors. I'm never letting my husband talk me into such a stupid decision again.

So far I like my apartment and I have been here almost 2 months. My only complaint is my neighbors above me are extremely loud and I have a newborn so this is frustrating. It sounds like a baby running back and forth all night. Also my neighbor across from me plays loud music during the night a lot and sometimes the day. My baby has been woken up several times. Other than that nothing else</review>

< Review>
We stayed at the Arbors for a year. Parking is HORRIBLE. There’s hardly ever any available parking. We had moved in at the beginning of May and the heat wave was just getting started. We had sent MANY requests for maintenance to fix the AC in our apartment and every time it would still continue to blast out hot air from outside. We ended up frying all summer long. They over charge everything. How does trash go up month by month higher and higher??? Utilities charges were a joke. When we left after the year contract was up, rent went up by $300. Not worth any of it!! Go save yourself money and put the money towards a house. When we left, we rented the carpet cleaner and vacuum to clean twice. Inspection came around and we were told we didn’t clean our carpet, I even gave them a receipt. We waited to get our refund back and was told it would come with a receipt/invoice of what was charged. NOPE. They just took more than have of our deposit from us without explanation. We will have to go find out why we were charged for what we were charged. Last time we spoke to someone in the office we were told our last payment was final with utilities, but the moment we turned in our keys, they said we had to pay for the last 3 days or so for the month. How could utilities cost up to $100+ for 3 days?? Anyways, I digress. Don’t live here, they’ll rob you of all your money.<//Review>

Disgustingly horrendous apartment complex, in every way you can think of. Please check YELP. I've reviewed them in detail there and you can view other's reviews also and see that any decent human being despises this place. NEVER rent from here. Seriously. Even if you were literally going to be homeless you should still not take the decision lightly. Your local YMCA or homeless shelter is likely better maintained and carsc about their residents more than this dump.

Also, to whomever is reading this. This review is not written as a knee jerk reaction to something that happened to me recently. I stayed here 3-4 years ago. But they've left such a nasty impression on me and I hate this place so much I'm willing to write a bad review again years later just to spite The Arbors. Not to mention they ruined my near perfect credit. Extremely dishonest immoral company.

P.S. oh, and in case you're wondering why there are good reviews here on Google it's because they literally bribed people to leave good reviews with the chance of winning a flat screen TV. If you check the YELP reviews there is proof of this there.<//Review>

< Review>
I like it here a lot. The office people are pretty cool. Don't got much complaints. The jacuzzi brings my peeps around. Fitness center is usually empty, so I cancelled my LA Fitness membership and work out here now. I even run around the tennis court for some cardio. And you can't really beat this location... or the price. These apartments are cheap but they don't look cheap. My apartment was taken care of all the appliances look great and I got a washer and dryer with the place. I plan on being here a while.< /Review>

<Text>I just moved back and I couldn't have made a better choice! Being super realistic, I am super tight on income and I was living in a literal dump before. The Arbors can accommodate middle America and I feel like some of the reviews are not exactly true. 2nd timer here and I have NO complaints.<//Text>< Gmap_id>

Did a drive through for a friend out if state was a great complex.  Very large grounds with green spaces, a dog park, kids playground, pool, 2 exits.  Very close to shops and entertainment too.  Grounds were well manicured and updated with mature trees throughout.</review>

Let me make it clear they owed ME money after my move out but said I lived there for an extra week that I did not. I moved out, turned in my keys and moved on to my new residence. Months later I’m commuting to work and get a call from a collections agency explaining I owe $900 - this collection company is literally bottom of the barrel gutter trolls who will literally threaten you to get you to pay money you don’t owe. I attempted 3 separate times to get in touch with the office and the staff. I went in personally and insisted they help me with the issue each time they promised it was being taken care of. I should have been more persistent. I work 50 hour work weeks so going into this place was becoming a chore. The “collection” I came later to find the complex admitted they made a mistake and in fact owed me $80 after move out and they told me they “emailed” corporate and it would be corrected. Weeks went by once again at this point I had a derogatory mark on my credit file which means if I want to rent again I will be denied. I had to pay it in the end to prevent any negative impact to my credit.

Long story short this place will literally RUIN your credit steal your money and get away with it. On top of that it’s old a run down something a new coat of paint can’t hide, roaches, drug deals constantly happening on the premises, murrieta PD is there raiding apartments every week. There are many other complexes in town with a better living experience.<//text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

I applied for an apartment after being shown the model apartment and some of the amenities. They only show you things that are in the front of the property, the only portion of this complex they manage to clean. I spent almost $400 and was told that the “membership fee” was refundable if I wasn’t going to move in, otherwise I never would have spent this exorbitant amount. I applied and came in a week later and decided to drive around the property myself. The trashes everywhere were overflowing, there was garbage on the ground in front of apartments, and it smelled like skunk and cigarette smoke everywhere, especially towards the back of the property. There were residents smoking on their balcony even though they have a policy that you aren’t supposed to smoke in the units, nothing was being done to prevent this. I asked one of the leasing agents, Daniel, if I could see what an available unit looks like. He gave my boyfriend and I his keys to walk ourselves there. Keep in mind he told me this was a FINISHED unit, ready for move in. I went in and was SHOCKED. It looked absolutely NOTHING like the model, the flooring was not the same, the ceiling was literally sagging, which is 100% a safety hazard. Cabinets were broken, it was dirty, the mirror was discolored and chipping, and the light fixtures were rusty. At this point I was not sure I wanted to live here anymore. I asked Daniel if things like this are repaired before move in, and he kept changing the subject and not answering my question. He told me that he didn’t know what I was talking about when I described the issues in the unit, which is 100% a lie, as any rational person would notice all of those problems and be extremely unhappy if that’s what they’d have to live with. I decided I no longer wanted to live in this complex, and asked him about the refund, and he changed his tone instantly, immediately interrupted me, told me it was “too late” and I can wait and see once I move into the apartment. How is it “too late”? I NEVER signed anything saying I will be living in this complex, and only a week had passed. What in the world is this “membership fee” for when I’m not even a member of this apartment complex??? He acted as though I was going to sign things to bind myself to this place without any of my questions answered or issues resolved. The entire time we were having this discussion, one of the female employees also in the office was smiling and making snarky facial expressions. I really wish I had read the Yelp reviews before even going to this place, because they are definitely all true! These people know their complex has massive issues, and they want to make money, that’s why they show you a model that looks nothing like the apartments you’ll actually live in so they can scam money out of you when you change your mind! PLEASE look elsewhere for apartments, as there are so many beautiful ones in Temecula/Murrieta that are less expensive, and much more professional. I’m so disgusted with this entire experience and the incredibly rude employees, I have never experienced something this awful, and I have visited numerous apartments in this area.< /Text>

Also your out of luck if the office is closed. It's clear the bare minimum of anything ever done to the apartments is to make it livable. The rates for what you get is ridiculous. These apartments are old and ghetto... For $1500/month!!!! Oh yea and parking is a joke... Good luck finding a spot after 7pm.

< review>
Just moved out after having a work order from MAY not completed for my refrigerator door. I gave birth & had surgery & called in between each major life event for updates (waiting on part was their answer) and could not take the frustration of having to call for updates (along with other housing frustrations) anymore.  I called their corporate office for escalated assistance & was left with " MAILBOX FULL" message.  Emailed JRK Property Holding, (the investment firm for this company) to share my concerns & no call or reply! This Apartment complex has no upper management to hold anyone in the office accountable!
1. Not enough parking to support tenant occupancy, EVER
2. Spider & ant infestation- Was bitten 4 months pregnant, & so has everyone of my visitors
3. Old carpets, fell apart in several areas & corners while vacuuming, & lifts from floor - ALLERGY FILLED!- Office manager told me the date of the carpet is underneath the carpet because I was concerned about the health & well being of my husband worsened allergies.
4. Weak electrical work- dead outlets, new light bulbs constantly burn out, dinning fan light flickers- could not fix
5. STRUCTURALLY UNSAFE- Uneven floors where you can feel tiles shifting that are underneath the carpet between the kitchen & living room- HUGE CONCERN since there is people below us! I felt my heart drop every time I heard the floor click fearing anyone can fall through.
Brandi the office manager was could not call me to address my concerns professionally instead emailed me 3 days after I had delivered a letter in person.  For "training purposes" they listed my phone records which was grossly inaccurate & claimed I never notified them of a majority of my concerns listed... EXCEPT maintenance made repairs on majority of them (AC, electrical, plumbing, pest control) so she called me a lair, essentially. The office team lacked empathy whenever I expressed a real concern, & Proved to fail in property management & record keeping.

It appears this company Cares more about the Property Grounds then the safety & structure of their apartment unit!!
They start asking for reviews 1 month after move in & send you a reminder every month, so any positive reviews are from tenants who have yet to have a have a problem, concern, or need from management. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else!!< /review>

<Review>I love this place. Moved in not too long ago and everything has been smooth sailing from the get go.

I've had one maintenance request for the smoke detector and the maintenance man was here within 2 hours.

The pools are clean and well kept, the landscaping is lovely, the complex is quiet and well kept. It's also located near A LOT of shopping and dining. It's been a really great place to live and I hope to stay here quite a while.

I'd recommend The Arbors to anyone and everyone who's looking for a peaceful, well taken care of complex to call home.<//Review>< pictures>

<Text>This is my first place and by far has been absolutely horrible.

I work during the office hours and when I call for anything: maintenance, wanting a garage, or any questions at all...they never answer and a off site office answers who's only job is to email the leasing office informing them of the call. I've called 8+ times. All of which get forwarded and I never receive a call back like I request. Even to add a garage.

Maintenance takes forever. emergencies took 3-5 days to fix. there should be week round maintenance. if my apartment that im paying for is having issues out of my control, I don't want to wait 72 hours. and based off the size of the complex. it shouldn't take that long. and since it does, you can assume that they have non stop maintenance issues.

rent is never pulled within a reasonable time. they provide an app to add connivence but it takes the app anywhere from 3-6 days to pull out the funds.

apartment was no where near the show apartment. I wasn’t able to see it because the last tenant was still living there. and when I finally got into my apartment, it smelled like there was 5000 cats living there. and im very allergic to cats so I had to spend the first night in my very first apartment sleeping in my car. and the following night at a friends until the apartment aired out.

every other tenant I've spoken to, hates this place. not a single person who makes average amount of money likes it here. if I was making a lot more money, id be less irritated but being that I live on a budget, this place is killing me.

there is animals everywhere here. I have smelled skunks every morning for the past 7 months here. I almost got bitten one night when I was walking to my apartment (it was dark at the time and the building lights weren't even on. another issue) and I walked to close to an animal I couldn't even see and almost got bit.

they repainted the buildings and did a horrible job.

THEY ARE A TOTAL SCAM. AND ONCE YOU SIGNED THE LEASE. THEY TREAT YOU LIKE TRASH. I AM A TOTALY CALM PERSON AND EVERYTIME I HAVE TO SPEAK TO THE OFFICE, I LEAVE WANTING TO DO SOME UNGODLY THINGS TO THEM.

AND TO THE MANAGMENT...THIS ISNT GERMANY HITLER, IF YOU DONT SEE HOW MUCH EVERYONE HATES IT HERE AND MAKE EFFORTS TO SOLVE THE ISSUE. ILL BE SURE TO START KNOCKING ON DOORS TO GET A NEW STAFF AND ALL POLICIES AND RULES HERE RE-EVALUATED< /Text>< Pictures>

So far, so good.  I've been living here about 2 months now and this apartment complex has been pretty good.  I've only had one maintenance request that I've submitted so far and they were very prompt to get it fixed.  It's a good location with easy freeway access, I haven't had any issues with my neighbors and it's been pretty quiet which, as far as it goes for apartments, is exactly what I'm looking for!</text>

Reading these reviews doesn’t feel fair. I understand everyone has different experiences and it takes one negative experience to lash out and leave a nasty review. Most of the reviews I’m reading are because of dumb choices “I parked on a red curb so my car was towed” would you park on a red curb anywhere in else expecting to get away with it?
I’ve lived here for 3 years and I can honestly say I love it. The office staff has ALWAYS helped me and treated me kindly. My neighbors aren’t so bad (keep to themselves and respect the communities “quiet hours”). I play by the rules, pay my rent on time, respect everyone around me. I DON’T park on red curbs so my car has never been towed. Maintenance is a huge help, I’ve had them in my apt for minor things through out my stay and they always get the job done. I’ve never experienced a pest issue here and can’t speak for others but I do maintain my apartment and I’m pretty cleanly. The office girls are sweet and so kind to me whenever I’m in the office. I honestly don’t know where the negative reviews are coming from concerning the staff (y’all must have been at a different office because these clearly aren’t the same ladies your bashing). Maintenace is on it and I’ve RARELY had to wait longer than 1 day to have my work orders completed. The property itself is beautiful and full of nature. My quality of life has been amazing here.
What I hope you take from this review is everyone has different experience based on choices THEY'VE made. Mine has been a very pleasant one here. I would recommend The Arbors to anyone looking for an inexpensive but still tasteful and decently sized apartment. You honestly can’t beat their prices.< /Text>

I got a bad impression of the staff at this place right away. I went in to check out the apartments recently. When I walked in, the staff just looked at me and didn't say anything, no smile, greeting, "we'll be with you shortly," no acknowledgment of me being there at all, just left me standing there. Then a female staff, Hispanic, with light-ish hair came out and "helped" me, with attitude the whole time, saying that they were all too busy to show me anything. She didn't offer to schedule me for a later time, or another day, or anything. She didn't seem like she wanted to tell me about the apartment availability, keeping her interaction very minimal. I had been looking at apartments around the area that day, and all of the other apartment complexes in the area had nice, helpful staff. The staff at this apartment complex needs some customer service training.< /text>

<review>This is a copy of the review I posted through the company website although I had to shorten it due to the limits set by Google.

Miguel is the only qualified person to be found on site and addresses service requests with ease.

Unfortunately, this was only in instances where my request was actually responded to and not automatically being closed out when I submitted the request. Speaking of responses: service requests, issues or concerns I had submitted both in Entrata and Email, as well as any correspondence regarding community policies or notices both prior to my tenancy, during my lease period, and in the process of leaving this dump has been minimal (at best, if ever a response is given by management which, should be noted, is rare!!!). On move in day, I asked about the laundry situation after no one answered or responded to my calls prior to move in day, and was told the laundry was 24hours, I was provided a map to find the laundry room. The not so funny part is the assistant manager watched the leasing agent fail to mention the laundry was card operated and the laundry card was ONLY available for purchase or reload in the office, during regular business hours, which are completely unpredictable! I only found this out when I requested service in my apartment (I believe for a shower rod which I ultimately repaired myself) and asked that a laundry card be left when the technician came by and the service unrelated to the laundry situation was never even addressed, I received a response about the laundry card and my request was closed!

When I have entered the office to submit a payment, I have not been greeted and I was not even acknowledged until I was awkwardly looking around the lobby wondering which of the 2 leasing agents or assistant manager was gonna take my money, or if anyone has even noticed I was in the office! The landlord of my new home actually stated that the customer service from the Arbors leasing and management was extremely poor during her verification, a complete stranger could assert that just from dealing with the Arbors staff on a professional basis!

Unfortunately, with all the money being paid, not one person can be paid to pick up the trash left around the dumpsters from homeless people who are camped around the property and the animals who can’t help but be attracted to the smell of the rotten trash that gets disposed of, maybe 2x a week (nowhere near enough for a property this size generating this much garbage!) I’m still seeing the same garbage outside that’s in pictures on Yelp from years ago.

Murrieta is far too beautiful a city to have an apartment community renting filthy, severely neglected homes as what I walked into September 26, 2018. The baseboards were filthy, there was soot and dust on every cabinet and counter top as well as the toilet and shower looking like drug people had been living here until the minute I walked through the door! I had to clean every surface, including the walls before I could unpack anything. I wiped the inside of every cabinet and drawer as nothing looked like it was touched by anything other than an ant or cockroach. No matter how immaculate or how much bleach I used, the bugs literally ever stopped coming. I have had to treat my apartment on so many occasions, and the roaches just kept having babies. I’m extremely concerned by the amount of chemicals I’ve had to use to clean every last crumb as soon as it falls and there still roaches coming through the walls in the bathroom. Whoever has been living here has brought one actual hell of an infestation. I’m writing this review as I’m listening to the flutter of a roach across my floor and I can hear one neighbor telling another outside that they can’t wait to get out of here as soon as possible!<//review><Pics>None<//Pics>< response>

They need to get a laundry card machine in the laundry room that people can access when their laundry card runs out of money. Instead of only being in the office, coming home from work and they left early so theres no access to the laundry card machine.<//review>< response>

Lived here 4mo exited the lease early gave 2mo notice we were moving out PAID $2500 to break the lease, left the apartment spotless and yet they still kept our deposit, charged us $80 for "cleaning" and charged us a month & a half rent AFTER we left! Said "sorry but the computer still shows ur here cuz u didn't pay the $2500 at the time you gave your notice to vacate"....HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE HERE! DONT MOVE IN HERE!!!!</Review>

<review>BIG Deposit Rip Off Scheme! Potential renters beware! They removed my last post on google! This is FRAUD! Girls in management office being told by corporate office in LA to "approve" most renters. They take HUGE deposits- upwards to $450-$500! They tell you that "you're approved" and the deposit money goes towards move in expenses.  Then, they ignore phone calls and after date passes to return deposit, they change and increase the financial terms of move in! Asking for several hundred more than previously agreed upon! When renters can not come up with the extra cash- they illegally KEEP the initial deposit!<//review><pictures>None<//pictures><response>{'time': 1503339428602, 'text': 'Hi Dana, We apologize for the poor experience you received.

Nice property grounds, lovely pool and  maintenance is really nice but the permanent smell of pot wafting through the air and the roaches,  bed bugs and cars bumping their bass at all hours as the drive through the parking lot... Not worth the hassle.</Text>

Woefully irresponsible staff and management.  We have had a hive of insects in front of our apartment for more than a month. Management refuses to remove it in a timely manner and give only excuses. Legal action pending. If you are looking for a place to live...move on!<//Review>

<time>1387623143597</time><Rate>1< /Rate><text>I do not know where the 9 '5 Star' reviews were living, but it definitely wasn't at the The Arbors at Cal Oaks.  I was going to leave a review on yelp, but it seems that most other people have done the work for me since these apartments are correctly rated at 1 star on that website.  I am currently living and can't wait till my lease is up.

The management here is terrible, I honestly don't know what the people in the front office do, honestly, beyond show new victims the model apartment.  My roommate and I had to put in 6 repair requests for them to just fix the light outside our front door, it took them 5 months.  The washing machine ruined a load of whites and recently a couple of colored dress shirts.  They came out with spotted grease marks and the people they have sent out to fix it just tell us that they see nothing wrong.  Our dishwasher currently floods our kitchen every time it's run.  My roommate and I have put in 4 repair requests each to have that fixed.  It's still broken and we have yet to have anyone out to fix it.

Those are only the main issues we have had.  Had a friend cut his foot while in the jacuzzi from broken glass.  They didn't deliver on the property upgrades the promised and used to entice my roommate and I to move in.  Plain and simple, there are about a million better places to live than here.  I truly hope this keeps people from moving in.</text><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None</Resp>< gmap_id>

<Rating>1<//Rating><Review>The reason why I rate 1 star is due to the fact that it's peaceful in the sense of privacy,
Maintenance for anything that is wrong with the apartment is utterly terrible and If you put a request in, it usually ends up happening within hours from the time you set for the request, or the next day.
I know there are some people who are looking for an affordable place in Murrieta, but if you really are concerned about how much you make, go for another complex.
I had a simple issue with my kitchen and A/C, which has known to be prominent in the Arbors.
I suggest anyone moving to this place reconsider other options highly.
I hope you make a right choice.<//Review>< pics>

<Review>I wish I could give this place HALF A STAR! DO NOT MOVE HERE!
"Luxury apartments" ... yeah right this place is Ghetto asf.
Gates hardly ever work,  BBQ's don't work, fire pits don't work,  there are skunks everywhere, the trash cans are always overflowing, the on-site laundry room is a joke, the pool's are dirty almost every time I go, they take forever to respond to maintenance issues, there are ants and spiders all over the apartments that the management does nothing about, and last but definitely not least THERE IS NEVER ANY PARKING. Good luck finding a parking spot past 5:00pm you are either forced to park across the street or in a fire lane with the inherent risk of getting towed which has happened to numerous people in this complex including myself. Please do your self a favor and DO NOT MOVE IN HERE!<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures>< resp>

The communication at this place is terrible. They owe me a refund of $300 and I was supposed to get it a month ago. Since then I have emailed, called, texted, and I haven’t even gotten so much as a response. Do not deal with them if you want actual service and not scams.<//Review>

This is the cheapest place to rent in Murrieta. It’s not too bad but when you move out be prepared to get screwed. Don’t think you are going to get security deposit and if you don’t tell them you are vacating the premesis in 60 days they will charge you for an extra month of rent. Check all the horror stories on Yelp if you don’t believe me.< /Text>

Do not rent here! Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced. Management and staff are rude with 'tough guy' mentality and have minimal interest with resolving resident issues. This community is a perfect example of what happens when residents are looked at as nothing more than dollar signs.

If you're looking for a calm, pleasant living environment with staff that treats you like a person and not a number than this is not the place. Go spend your hard earned money somewhere else.</text>

I have only been here a week, but it seems nice so far.  You are paying what you get for guys, they are some of the cheapest apartments in town and I've never experienced loud or crazy neighbors. The walls are thin so yes you do hear a thump here or there, but I can't hear people talking.. When I moved in my apartment was prefectly ready to go other than a small patch of carpet that was clearly replaced and different which was documented.  The reason for 4 stars is all of the junk I have seen out front of neighbors houses and the lights that are so bright all night and I have to cover my windows as much as possible to get some sleep, but again you get what you pay for like I said.  Everyone seems friendly and my place is cozy and seems safe no problems so far.<//text>

My husband and I, along with our two young children foolishly lived in these apartments for nearly 2 years, from July 2012 until late June 2014.  We only did so because we were trying to save money to buy a house, and ended up moving back in with my husband's parents.  Yeah, it was THAT BAD.  To start, initially there was dog poop.  EVERYWHERE.  Pet friendly?  More like we don't give a crap about crap.  Seriously.  Then ants, everywhere.  I cleaned constantly and tried everything.  They were still everywhere.  Of course, management did nothing, claiming they sprayed for bugs and what not.  Whatever.  Then was the mold.  Initially when we moved in, we thought it was fine, because they painted over it!  I did my best, bleaching it and cleaning it to no avail.  If you are not a smoker or are not into drugs, this is not the place for you.  Even with our windows closed and AC off cigarette smoke still permeated into our apartment through the pathetic walls.  My husband and I and our son all have asthma.  Management didn't care.  They said there was nothing they could do.  Speaking of the pathetic walls, you can hear people having sex through them.  Wow, isn't that great? NOT!  In addition, the community is very unsafe.  I don't care how much they say its improved.  Instead of trying to keep bad people out, how about kick the bad people out?  We were literally surrounded by drug lords.  No matter how much we reported them to management, and even though the police were constantly coming to arrest people in those apartments, management did nothing.  Apparently they care more about money than the safety of their residents.  The security guards are useless.  I tried calling them multiple times when our neighbors were high on drugs and damaging items we had on our porch or just being loud until 3 or 4 am in the morning.  They never came.  Most of the time the pool was broken as well as the workout room.  Our dishwasher was covered in rust and they said it was "fine" and didn't need to be replaced.  We constantly found condoms in the pools along with cum and pubic hair.  Whoever wrote a good review on here must have been paid to.  I know too many people that used to live there and they all say the same thing, GET OUT ASAP.  Please, they are cheaper than other apartments for a reason.  Don't sacrifice your safety and sanity.  Live with your parents or in a homeless shelter before you go here.  Don't waste your time and money!</review>

The WORST place to live. Management is completely unprofessional. If you have any concerns or issues don't bother in trying to bring it up to their attention they DON'T CARE no matter how many calls you make,  emails you send, office visits you pay, addendums you sign (42pgs. FYI), or promises they make in the beginning they never respond to your messages or emails. The grounds, gym, and pools are never kept up they are DIRTY, and their is feces from people's pets every where. If your apartment needs maintenance you'll be waiting a long time. It's not a gated community because the gates never work so their always open. They have an infestation of ants, spiders, and SKUNKS!  SERIOUSLY don't ever leave your windows open at night even if your trying to conserve energy from using the AC.  If safety is a concern in the managements words " you CAN call the police".  Their "security" is a kind, but grungy man that will show up to your door in a dirty T- shirt, beat up cargo shorts, and sandals with no solution and that's only if he's in town and available. If some one parks in your spot the Tow never shows up and your lucky if you find an open space to park your vehicle.  Their is an excuse for everything; according to management.  I'm not exaggerating,  I just want to warn people before they get stuck in a horrible situation for a year the way we did.

Warning!!! NOW THEIR TRYING TO BRIVE TENANTS WITH A NEW TV RAFFLE LOL FOR THEIR POSITIVE REVIEWS!!!! Their getting so many negative reviews their trying to brive for good ones. It's so bad I literally see a moving truck with people packing in their belongings every other day. That's a huge turn around on tenants.</Text>

<Review>Pretty sure this is my FIRST ever review on anywhere. My husband and I moved in to this place thinking it was so cool, and such an awesome price. We were totally wrong and our first apartment experience was miserable, we even moved in with my parents because we couldn't handle it anymore.

When you go there they preach to you how they have no drug, no drinking policies, they tell you that you are only allowed one covered parking spot, they explain to you the safety they provide and how luxurious it is.

Well, we were there for a year, about 7 months out of that year the gates remained OPEN. No point in even having a gate code. The family above us had at least 5/6 people living there (they told us that you are only allowed a certain amount of people living in your apartment) which this family owned at least 4/5 cars I couldn't keep up.. at times they would park 3 of their cars in covered parking spaces. BS! Someone above us smoked weed at least twice a day and the smell would linger into our apartment every time. I even found a bag of weed in the parking lot. People always drinking at the pool. The dumpsters were always trashed and disgusting. Our apartment always had roaches, and ants which I had to get rid of myself, everyday there was a new bug, our a/c went out, our garbage disposal and even our toilet leaked at one point. OH yeah the parking spot they give you? it's usually on the complete opposite of your building.

We got a notice that they were raising the rent (yeah NO way were we gonna pay more for somewhere we weren't content with) so we gave the 60 day notice as required.. we kept getting notices that they didn't receive a 60 day notice blabla, so I kept a copy and went to speak with the same girl who we gave our notice too and she said "Oh the manager must of lost it, let me make another copy..." REALLY? so got that squared away we moved out, and it was refreshing.

I was just waiting for the balance we owed in the mail to the forwarding address I gave the girl, she explained it would be mailed. Well TODAY I receive a call from some company saying I had an unpaid balance with the arbors of $264 (I literally only owed maybe 70-80 bucks for utilities) they told me that my balance was mailed to me and that's why they called cause I never paid it. WHAT I never RECIEVED IT? So I question it of course, she said it was for damages and the utilities. I was furious, because I never got a report, letter, or even a call regarding this which they should follow up on themselves. I was in TEARS I work hard and so does my husband for our money and I just had to pay for something I didn't understand cause I didn't receive anything regarding it and I didn't want my credit to get hurt by this.

My husband goes down there to talk to them and they said the charges were for utilities, and for damages like carpet cleaning etc. They even said I didn't turn in my remote for the stupid gate that never works anyways, which I DID FREAKING TURN IT IN. but whatever, we paid for it because I do not want to deal with this place ever again. Not sure if anyone will read this review, but I really hope you save your hard earned money and take it elsewhere because how they handled this all was so unprofessional to me. OH yeah and my husband still gets calls from their "front gate" which means he's still in the system and we haven't been living there for a month so someones just trying to get in the gate by calling his phone. SO SAFE.<//Review>< GmapID>

People who only see the negative are too self centered and are occasional contributors to the negative. As a former employee, fixing the negatives into positives was my job. I was the gentleman who carried the bucket, picking up trash, cleaning out the dumpsters and cleaned the pools. I can assure you that the MAINT team work hard, day in, day out. They never stop giving their 100. The office crew have so much on their hamds, it's hard to believe the outstanding job they do each day. These ladies are hardworking and very helpful to their clients.
I ask all future residents to be patient and have a open mind. This complex is located at the most convenient spot one could ever ask for. With in a 3 mile radius, you have nearly everything you can ask for.
As a resident, I had an outstanding experience. My cutie and I started off our lives together in a 1 bdrm, Aspen model. Very cozy and heartwarming. Shout out to Alena♡ for being our leasing agent. lol. We had to leave due to my military duties overseas, but returning to The Arbors is a big and huge maybe.
Trust me, with patience and a open mind, you will have a lovely stay. If you see anything negative, don't complain. Notify the office and the MAINT will be there to assess the issue. In other words, help us help you. Simple as that☆

<Review>This place is terrible!!!! worst customer service from staff and manger, parking sucks, and my apt has had issues since I moved in 2 months ago, they are aware of it and still haven't fixed anything or called me. I would HIGHLY recommend staying away from this place as I do plan on moving out soon as well. I hate writing bad reviews but this place sure does deserve one.</Review><gmap_id>0x80dc825a513a9497:0x761b6a1e2e61176c< /gmap_id><Pictures>None< /Pictures></record>

LONG POST BUT WORTH IT
I was going to give this place a 3/5 at first but the last few months I lived there were awful. Truly awful.  After a month of trying to get the renewal offer before we had to turn in a moving notice, and being told "we'll have it next week" 4 times, I finally got an offer of $1,220, 3 days before we had to give notice for our shoebox sized unit. Then the NIGHT before (seriously, at 8:30pm) there was the "real official offer" taped to my door for $1,280. No thanks.
Now after being moved out for over a month, our deduction statement and remainder of our deposit are nowhere to be seen. Under law, we are supposed to get it within 21 days. After numerous unanswered emails, I call the office and the manager told me she called my husband, correctly read his number to me, and claimed she left a voicemail the day prior. Hard to do that when he doesn't have a voicemail set up. When I tell her this fact, she's obviously displeased and doesn't offer an explanation. We may be taking this to court.
The thing is, if they had been honest, courteous and punctual, I still would have left a 3/5. I understand that mistakes happen, but own up to them. This complex is horrible about its maintenance staff completing repairs, their pools in operation, and now apparently they drag their feet in regards to returning security deposits.  I hate to be so negative but seriously, I would rather live in a cardboard box then rent from JRK residential again if their properties are like this.</review>

Grounds are not well kept... dog doo doo and cigarette butts everywhere. A.C. unit leaks and when we informed management, they told us not to go below 75 degrees. In the heat of summer we went as low as 80 degrees and still A.C. leaks. Glad we moved out. Worse place to rent< /review>

O My God why didn't I listen to the reviews. I've lived here only 3 weeks and I want to move out. Holly hell I'm freaking stupid... Don't be like me, don't be STUPID! Dog crap everywhere, pools that look like ponds, (yes there are ducks in them) carpets with animal crap stains, management or what I call (people that sit in the offices) that don't care. Best thing about these apartments is the landscaping on the outside that lures victims in. Go away,,, go far away from this apartment complex! You've been warned!<//Review>

I live here right now. Have for over a year now. This place is terrible!! If you put in a work order, the maintenance will not get it done, and they will say they did, when they NEVER DID! The staff will say they will do something, and they never will. You will be forgotten about by the staff and maintenance. If you are not home, someone will just walk in without your permission. One time i was in the shower and one of the staff members came in without even knocking!! Our A/C hasnt worked ever since we moved in, and still doesnt work. All the neighbors suck, they are loud and dont care about anything. Maintenance has come in and played my $1000 guitar without my permission! I never let anyone touch my guitar, and for him to come in and do that, hes lucky i was not home. Also, the neighbor kids do not care about anything, their parents will not care about what they do. The kids here will jump on your car and run away when you say something. The parents and staff do not do anything! Just want everyone to know. This place is not worth all the money. There will always be problems and you will never get it fixed. DO NOT MOVE HERE.</Text>

<user>113508485779656230229</user><text>UPDATE!! March 1st 2018
I finally received a third of my security deposit due to various reasons that I don’t agree with. This was was dragged out for over 6 months. I hope people see my review and learn from my mistake of ever renting an apartment with the Arbors of California Oaks.

UPDATE!! JAN 11th 2018
- It is now over 6 months of not receiving my security deposit, and now management nor corporate are returning my phone calls and email. GREAT. If I could give this complex and companies negative reviews I would. Civil suit pending. Court Date pending. Hopefully your staff will respond to court mandated hearing.

Hello,

My name is Antonio Cetta. I was your Tennent from Sept 13th 2016 to July 30th 2017. I have still not received my security deposit. I know my rights as a renter, even in our lease agreement I am supposed to receive my deposit after at least 21 business days. It’s now December 8, 2017….. its  been six months. Not only have I not received my deposit BUT do I not agree with certain deductions (Which I requested a call back from a supervisor to go over with multiple times to only be put on hold or hung up on). I am sending you this message because I WILL bring you to small claims court if this issue isn’t taken care of by the end of the year. I would like a call from a supervisor to assure me that a check will be sent to my address which I gave to associate multiple times  and to go over specific deductions like Partial paint/materials, and Industrial Repairs, You have my cell phone on file. I don’t mean to come off rude or aggressive at all BUT my deposit have been way overdue.

I look forward to your immediate response

Sincerely,
Antonio Cetta

<Text>I neglected to write a review because I wanted to put this place in my rear view. Yet after not receiving my deposit since July of 2016 and just recently receiving a call from collections about an amount owed that was never mentioned in the numerous times I've called to receive my deposit. This apartment complex is run a by a huge rental company JRK. They have no personal incentive to keep you happy or correct issues that arise. Many neighbors are loud. Domestic abuse and loud neighbors are quite common here. Talk to the Murrieta Police Department and ask about their reputation. All of this might be forgivable if they had a low price point but they don't, they list themselves as a luxury community. The whole complex has issues with ants as well. Please save yourself the headache.< /Text><pictures>None< /pictures>< response>

<username>Taylor Stahnke</username><text>Update: Still living in the same unit. Maintenance came in to try and simply patch up the walls that were damaged from the leak. We told them there would be mokd build uo and possibly fungus, which is all over the inside of the walls now. So they came in and cut open the walls and insisted we run a dehumidifier. Yeah no. We need to be moved and this unit needs to be cleaned. We are finally moving units on the 11th, but are not being compensated for rent, even though our kitchen and living room are completely unusable due to the uninhabitable conditions.

Oh yeah. They just tried to charge us a delinquent fee on our utilities even though the check had been cashed. This place is shady and we are taking them to court. Good luck to anyone looking to move here.

Upstairs neighbors flooded their apartment which leaked into our entire apartment. Management took over an hour to respond. Didnt come check for damages until two days later, and without us home, even though we signed that it was NOT OKAY TO ENTER without us being there. The day after that the neighbors flood again, same way, by leaving a washing machine on and leaving the unit. The neighbors have not been evicted, nor have we been offered any type of compensation or a new unit to move into. A manager wouldnt put an available unit on hold for us, although this emergency makes our unit uninhabitable. I would not recommend moving here at all, thid place is a joke. They lost our repair sheet you turn in your first 48 hours moving in. It's to list any repairs needed that were missed when preparing the unit. On top of that, they also lost our renter's insurance, which is funny, considering you can't rent here without it. They also upcharge you different rates for sewage and water, without listing thr variables that change the cost. Management is poor and shady and it seems they have a biased hiring process. I would avoid this place at all costs.< /text><rate>1<//rate><Response>None<//Response>< Time>

< Review>
Been here over 2yrs. The rent goes up $100 every year for my 1bd apt. with no laundry. Got parking ticket, when the new management took over and assign parking space. I have to go to police station to get problem solved. Don't expect the manager to solved it you. I've talk to him few time and did nothing about the ticket. I sold 1 car, because of parking space. Come home at 9:00 pm parking is filled. First year I pay for sewage, trash, electric and gas is free.  Now they charge me gas and water. Water is under sewage before, not anymore. And now that they remodel the place, parking will be harder for people with more than 1 car.</Review>

< Review>
If they had negative stars, that would have been their rating. I tried my hardest to let bygones be bygones but after this last experience with them I had to tell the world of my horrific stay at the Arbors aka Hell on Earth.

If you are debating on living here -JUST DO NOT!  THESE ARE THE WORST APARTMENTS I HAVE EVER LIVED IN!

Where do I start? Just like you I wanted to save money on my rent... Like  the people below said "take your hard earned money elsewhere" or "you get what you paid for". This is so true!

1st day we moved into our SUPPOSEDLY "apartment ready condition apartment" the following is what we walked into and I promise I am not exaggerating. A huge bleach stain as soon as you enter the apartment, one window cracked and the outside screen ripped and semi falling off, literally the pantry door falling off the hinge, 2 electrical sockets not working, our A-C leaking a tad bit onto the already not cleaned carpet and the A/C Vent on the ceiling cheaply tacked on but still looked as if it was going to fall on our heads if we stood underneath it, our carpet was D-I-S-G-U-S-T-I-N-G, black dog hair EVERYWHERE. I literally could not stomach it I called the front office to let them know these conditions.  The management at the time wanted to argue about it, finally after 4 phone calls later and some yelling she said she would send the cleaners to re clean the apartment ( which never actually happened).  This is where my husband and I should have just moved away and said for get it.

2 months into living there our apartment A/C Unit stopped working. I called immediately and placed a maintenance request. It was a such a huge battle for them to replace our unit we had to literally call the HOUSING DEPARTMENT ON THESE PEOPLE! We were living in inhabitable conditions for a weekend our apartment was literally 92 degrees! After the housing authority called them after 2 months of suffering they finally FINALLY ordered us a new A/C Unit and installed it. Oh and for our troubles of overheating literally forced to leave our apartment because it was so hot we had to stay in a  hotel and friends house for the duration of those days we only got a credit of 50$. I am not kidding people 2 months of us not even being able to live in our apartment they only gave us 50$!

The pools were shut down for some of the time we lived there. If you want to do laundry i pray you have your own unit in your apartment because if you do laundry at the community laundry facility guess what you cant because the machine that reloads your laundry card NEVER WORKS. Often we had to make trips to  my dads house to do laundry.

After all this was said and done the last thing that actually drove me to even create this post was at the end when we finally gave our 60 day notice and told them we would not be continuing our stay there. I physically walked in there a week after getting my finally bill and paid it in person. THESE PEOPLE SENT ME TO THE COLLECTIONS DEPARTMENT!!!!! I have never been late or missed a payment of rent or anything else in my life! I literally was penalized for being a responsible tenant and paying my last bill!!!??? Please people does this make any sense!? For your sanity PLEASE AVOID THE FRUSTRATION, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, ANGER AND ANNOYANCE my husband and i went through AND DO NOT MOVE INTO THESE APARTMENTS. I hope by sharing my story you will make the right decision for you.

Now Cory one of the managers there does try to do her best but maybe corporate or who ever she works for does not give her the necessary resources to actually do her job. I feel bad for her Martin I hope you guys can get new jobs soon because what ever company owns these apartments are serious awful people.< /Review>

<Review>DO NOT GO TO THE ARBORS FOR APARTMENTS.
My boyfriend and I had the worst first apartment applying experience here. We worked with a really rude, unprofessional and  disrespectful woman named Deborah who is in So-Cal from Atlanta Georgia. She kept reinforcing we would get a $100 processing fee back if we decided to cancel our applications. She mislead us to believe we would be getting a refund and kept saying, in her own words, "I am going to play the Georgia card and act like I dont know what Im talking about". We called to cancel and she not only told us we were wrong and "Not getting anything back" but she decided to hang up on us too. Tried to talk to the manager, was really no help . Worst experience, we saw the bad reviews and decided to still take a chance. DONT TAKE THE CHANCE HERE LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS.Its too bad I cant give it zero stars.<//Review>< pictures>

<Review>DO NOT MOVE HERE.  SHADY SHADY SHADY.

I made the unfortunate mistake of moving here because I was not familiar with the area and the prices were affordable back then.

It was a year of hell.  Drunk and crazy neighbors downstairs, had to call the police three times.  It wasn't till I had recordings and a lawyer on stand by for the leasing office to take action.

NOTHING Luxury about this place.  The building is was built around the 70's and everything breaks and takes forever for maintenance to take care of it.    Parking is horrendous after 5 PM.

Most of the residents seems very sketchy and it's known to the drug hub on Murrieta.  EWW.

Finally moved to a wonderful place.  I've been expecting for a call, email, or mail of my moving statement showing how much they will be swindling us.  Well what do you know, THEY NEVER SENT ME A LETTER.  Instead they sent me STRAIGHT to COLLECTIONS.   They are charging us $1000 in damages, can't wait to see how they JUSTIFY THAT.

Just called them and they denied what they did and a) they just expect postal service to figure out the new address b) they can email me the statement right now.

DO NOT MOVE INTO THE ARBORS!!!!!! THEY HAVE HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND THEY TELL YOU THEY HANDLE THE TERMITES IN THE APARTMENTS AND THEY REALLY DON'T. THEY TELL YOU THAT IT WAS ONLY ANTS. AND THEY HAVE BLACK MOLD. IN THEIR BUILDINGS. AND REFUSE TO REMOVE IT BECAUSE THEIR "RENOVATION/REMOLDING" IS TOO IMPORTANT.<//Text>

Not well taken care,  lights around property don't get repaired or changed. False advertising no 2 Jacuzzi poured concrete over 1. Repairs take for ever, serious ant problem and lacking in pest control yet they charge monthly for it.</Text>

<rate>1< /rate><review>Alert: do not move here. I used to live here and some people I know live there now. The things that go on here are borderline illegal.
I know someone who wrote a bad review and a few weeks later, someone from the office showed up with a 24 hour notice to inspect the apartment.

1. Rent everywhere else but here is due by the 5th with no late fee. The Arbors makes you pay by 3rd with a $150 late fee if you pay on the 4th. In addition, they'll only take a money order or cashiers check if you pay after the 1st. No personal checks.

2. Dog poop everywhere and most of the time the poop bag stations don't have any bags.

3. Thinnest walls I've ever lived in. You can literally hear conversions from next door units.

4. It takes maintenance forever to fix anything. They usually don't even show up when they are scheduled to.

5. They tow cars with expired tags.

I could go on all day, but if you don't believe any of this feel free to move in. You've been warned.</review>< pictures>

<review>Only been here for 2 weeks and already not liking it, they are not too good at communicating when you call them and something needs to be fixed, windows have black mold, carpet was stained when i moved in, got it washed but stains are still there, the only reason i moved in was because i thought they were luxury apartments but they definitely arent!!</review></record>

When you move in  here they do not tell you there are kids that are going to block your parking spaces and let you get your own apartment Parking space
They ride skateboards and bikes on the property and they threw fruit on your patios
Management does nothing about it
The staff is so unfriendly and rude when you try calling back after they get the sale
I'm not happy my friends moved in here
Terrible customer service !<//text>

Just a lovely experience all around. The young man serving our table was polite, helpful, and handsome to boot. He saw I was sticking to Blanton's and offered to make me a mixed drink where I can still enjoy the taste of bourbon, and I absolutely did love it. I'm not normally a fan of cocktails but I would come back here any time.<//Text>

Bridgett was AWESOME. Some of the girls do get busy and occupied so it sometimes does take a bit to get any other drink though.</Text>

<Review>Walked in at about 4:00 sat down and sat for a good 5min. got nothing! Both girls behind the bar saw me and ignored me. Somebody else came in that they apparently knew and they served him. So i walked out. So i guess if you know whos who you get served by them. I guess thats why i usually go on Saturday. Better service and a beautiful lady serving you.</Review><name>William Grossman< /name><date>1564185027497< /date>< pictures>

<Review>Good place for cold beer, mildly sexy outfits and a hepatitis micro culture pool they call the bathroom. Conversation ranges from Chem trails to Rastafari endeavors abroad. Make sure you are current on all your immunizations, despite what any anti vaxer patron might tell you.< /Review>< Pics>

Beer and wine,but the girls are fine,the owner has a fine choice in employees. A testament to the once mighty unions,blue collar workers,and good ol' boys who have lifted a beer in cheer,or drowned in one in sorrow<//text>

<time>1614386913023<//time><userid>107141059806207742915<//userid><review>I called in to make an appointment for an initial consult last week. A woman named Monika was helping and we agreed on 2/26 at 2pm as the appointment time. She took down my information and confirmed my appointment was booked over the phone. I took time out of work to drive from SF to Walnut Creek today for my appointment. When I arrived, a woman at the front desk blankly told me that I wasn’t in the books and that there PA is very busy on Friday, she wouldn’t be able to accommodate me. I asked her what had happened to my appointment and she told me that it looked like I had called in and rescheduled it. I explained to her that I never called to reschedule and that they must of rescheduled the wrong appointment. She said “yeah I don’t know what to tell you” and just stared at me blankly without apologizing. Another woman walked in and asked what was going on. I explained to her the situation and she started going on and on about how scheduling was out of their hands, and that they’re always having issues with it due to the system they use. Then she went on to say that a former employee, who was let go, was scheduling clients incorrectly, but that again due to the system and this employee it was out of their control. It was not until 5 minutes later that I got an apology. The woman urged me to reschedule my appointment or wait an hour for the PA to be available, but after all this, I will never be coming back here, especially if I can’t even trust them to schedule an appointment correctly. I have a job that is not easy to get time away from, so for me to spend 2.5 hours of my day driving from SF to Walnut Creek was a big deal. I felt my time was totally disrespected, and for that I would never return back here.<//review></record>

Over those years, she literally saved my life by finding, diagnosing and removing a highly aggressive skin cancer from my scalp and with her magical laser facial, has kept me looking 15 years younger than my actual age.  Dr. Lee and her staff are the  consummate professionals, you will feel well cared for, valued and understood.  Always on the technological cutting edge of treatment, you know the care Dr. Lee gives you is the best and safest while performed by her with compassionate efficiency.

Count your blessings if you have the good fortune to become Dr. Lee’s patient. I cannot recommend her more highly. Yelp needs another star for such a special person and physician.</text><Pics>None< /Pics>< resp>

Quick, professional and caring. I was able to quickly have a my mole removed by a wonderful PA Mariam. It didn't hurt at all!
The Mohs surgery was done quickly (I was able to get an appointment within 1 week where it takes months for other places) and with great precautions. I also got follow up appointments. The PA called many times to check in and answer all my questions. I choose to stay with this practice and highly recommend it!!</text>

I've been seeing Dr. Lee for years. So has my father, who's had multiple Mohs surgeries. I thought I'd try something different. So, I went in for a hydro facial. WOW!!! Now, don't expect a "spa" experience, this is a doctors office, so the hustle and bustle of a busy office is the vibe. DO expect to walk away feeling 10 years younger! Michele, the technician who did my facial, was knowledgeable and professional. Dr. Lee's staff were friendly and accommodating. Highly recommend Dr. Lee's office for ALL your skin care needs.< /Review>

<review>I call Dr. Lee my fairy godmother because she has gifted me with PERFECT skin! I started going to Dr. Lee 12 years ago when I was 24 years old and my skin has not aged since, her laser light facial truly is the fountain of youth. While other friends my age are starting to get wrinkles and other signs of aging, I am constantly given compliments and jaws drop when I tell people my real age, everyone thinks I am at least a decade younger. My secret? Dr. Lee and her AMAZING staff at East Bay Laser and Skincare. I will be a dedicated lifetime patient of Dr. Lee. Her laser treatments stopped the aging process as soon as I started receiving them 12 years ago, it is a miracle! If you want incredible, flawless, youthful skin there simply is no one better.<//review><pictures>None< /pictures>< resp>

<rate>5<//rate><review>I have been a long time patient of Dr. Christine Lee and have received only 5 star service from her and her super friendly professional staff. I have been to plenty of bad doctors where they rush you through the appt, don't answer your questions, and provide terrible quality ineffective service! You seriously get what you pay for.  I never mind the wait because she's worth it (what good reputable doctor wouldn't have a lot of patients!). Dr. Lee is the top expert in her field, always on the cutting edge, and you only want the best doctor when it comes to your face and body.
I’m a huge fan of her laser rejuvenation treatments where she has removed many years of sun damage and acne scars – I receive so many complements on my smooth skin and youthful appearance and I give full credit to Dr. Lee!  She is my fountain of youth. I wish there were more doctors out there like her who take the time to get to know their patients and make sure they're receiving the best care possible.  Dr. Lee has excellent bedside manners, always greets you with a smile and never makes you feel rushed.  I recently had a big cist removed from my lower right chin and she made sure I understood everything that was involved with the surgery explaining everything in layman's terms.  Throughout the surgery, she would always ask if I was feeling alright.  After the surgery, she contacted me the day after to check up on me and to make sure I was following the post op care instructions.  Thank you Dr. Lee and staff for all that you do for your patients, it is greatly appreciated!!!< /review><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>{'time': 1563372480067, 'text': "Thank you so much, it's been a pleasure working with you over the years!

Dr. Christine Lee is such an extra ordinary doctor. She is very comforting and reassuring. Her inspirational words gave me the strength not to fear pain and needles.Words cannot describe how grateful I am that you have a very tender touch. I hardly felt anything when you removed the cyst on my back and the skin tag hanging on my nose. You have a special gift as a surgeon and you did such a phenomenal job. Thank you so much Dr. Lee for your great humor, care and attention. I am in awe of your magical skills and your manner put me at ease and helped me gain confidence.

Dr. Christine Lee, you are the best doctor in my books. I will highly recommend you being a brilliant doctor and surgeon. I love and admire your staff. They are all very professional, sweet and very kind.Thank you!< /Review>

Dr. Christine Lee is such a remarkable doctor that I respect and trust. Thank you Dr. Lee for your excellent care and exceptional professional abilities. I appreciate your caring nature and I adore your loving personality.

I used to associate the word surgery to misery. After being under your care, I now associate surgery with healthy recovery. Dr. Lee, you approach surgery like an artist and you always take your time to do the job right. Thank you very much for taking care of me and being so skilled at what you do. If every doctor is as caring and generous as you, the world as they say will always be filled with smile and laughter instead of pain and sorrow. Your presence is priceless. Thank you for comforting me and taking away my pain and stress. I feel blessed to have come your way. I adore your staff and they are as caring and loving as you are.</text>

Dr Lee is a wonderful doctor. I brought two of my sons to see her, one for acne and one for an acute dandruff condition. I found her through the John Muir Doc directory and after reading her qualifications (teacher/consultant for laser manufactures) I knew that we found our doc. I found Dr Lee to be very smart and knowledgeable. She answered all of our questions and the results were wonderful! I have been singing her praises to all of my friends! She has really given my teen son his confidence back. If you want results go see Doc Lee!!</Review>

Not only was Michelle wonderful, but the office staff was so friendly and Dr. Lee took the time to see how I was doing. Overall, it was a great experience.

<userid>115489669440749575137</userid><name>Laura< /name><review>Dr. Lee saved my life.  While other doctors dismissed my concern of a changing mole as "vanity", Dr. Lee used her direct intelligence to instruct me to have my HMO remove it.  Dr. Lee was adamant that it needed to be removed and provided me with her long and impressive list of credentials with regard to her expertise in melanoma and moles.  She wanted me to use those credentials to impel my Kaiser physicians to take action.  Indeed, I did have to use her as my expert opinion.  Reluctantly the mole was removed by my assigned dermatologist and several days later I was told it was Melanoma.  I was fortunate that it was caught before it spread and that it could be all surgically removed.  Dr. Lee has laser sharp focus and care for what she does- whether it is a cosmetic or medical procedure/assessment.  For anyone wanting a sincere health professional with astute intelligence I would reccommend Dr. Lee.  She goes the extra mile.<//review><Time>1469553576929<//Time>< Pictures>

Dr. Lee is an amazing doctor who has saved my skin from prematurely aging--I was a sun worshipper for decades. Her laser treatments and advice have regenerated my skin by increasing collagen and reduced "age" spots. My skin is supple and smooth again--and my friends can't believe the change. Thank you so much, Dr. Lee!</text>

<Review>I have had such amazing experiences with Dr. Lee. She has the biggest heart and cares about her patients. She discovered various skin cancers on me and performed Mohs surgery a couple of times. She took the extra time and care to make certain that the scar on my nose appeared less noticeable. She followed up with lasers to make it look better and people are amazed when they see how good it looks.  Dr. Lee  takes the extra time listen to her patients and discuss their skin concerns. She has great, honest advice, and offers many treatment options. She is a perfectionist and takes a lot of pride in her work.  In addition, Dr.Lee's staff is friendly and professional. I always feel welcome when I go to the office. I have nothing but great things to say about this caring, knowledgeable, and professional doctor.

Dr. Lee provides the best laser treatments in the Bay Area.  She not only owns a ton of them, she knows how to use them.  Many doctors own lasers, but do not have the experience to yield good results.  Further, most doctors are inexperienced treating ethnic skin.  As a Type III patient, I could not take the risk of putting myself in jeopardy with a laser operator who didn't have the years of experience that Dr. Lee has.

I got the Total FX treatment done last month and can't believe that my ten-year old scar was diminished dramatically.  This is after struggling for a decade trying to get rid of it through treatments such as Affirm, Laser Genesis, microneedling including Infini, TCA Cross, and chemical peels.  Nothing worked until I met Dr. Lee.  My scars look so much better and my self esteem is much higher.  Thank you, Dr. Lee!

Dr. Lee prepared me for side effects that come with lasers, and I'm 100% positive I'm in good hands for getting rid of them.  Not only that, she is helping me with other skin issues I have on other parts of my body.

Anybody who seeks laser treatment must visit Dr. Lee, otherwise you're probably wasting your time and money.  I urge you to check out her credentials/experience and have a consultation with her.  I guarantee you'll be overwhelmed with the amount of knowledge she has regarding lasers.  After all, she works with laser companies and gives lectures on them.< /review>

< Review>
I've been going to the Skin and Laser Treatment Institute for about 14 years now, and learned of Dr. Lee through my rhinoplasty surgeon, Dr. Gruber. I was looking for treatment of my facial blemishes caused by the onset of adult acne. Being olive skinned, my blemishes took forever to disappear or never did.

Since meeting Dr. Lee in 2004, I now have great skin and get a lot of compliments on my complexion and its texture. I’m very happy. She initially put me on a skin cleansing regiment (which I continue to follow) and I see her once or twice a year for the LaserLite treatment. I saw results about six to eight months into my initial treatments, and it really has successfully suppressed my adult acne and blemishes. I’m just amazed that I’m at a point in my life where I can look in the mirror and be happy with what I see. Thank you, Dr. Lee. Sincerely.

On another note, I’m surprised to hear about the negative reviews of the staff, since I find all of them very attentive, pleasant and friendly — especially during the process of my treatments. The negative reviewers may have encountered the staff during a very busy day. It can get really hectic! But if you ever get to know the staff members, they are exactly as I described, and honestly, they're an awesome support team!</Review>

First impression first desk was ok, didn't really like how the assistant asked me if I had insurance if not I had to pay the fee  out of pocket (in front of the other people waiting in the room). I waited 30 minutes after my appt to be seen. I go back to the room where I they get more info from me. Then "Margaret" walks in apologies for the wait. Takes a look at my scar and ask multiple questions (reasonable). Then before I hear about any tretment she reminds me I have a fee to pay. Which I already knew that since the lady at the front desk called it out. She tells me she has to talk to "Steve" manager leaves the room and comes back saying what tretment I could get done. After explaining treatment she mentions how much it would be on top of the consultation fee. I mention I didn't care about pay. I tell her I have some questions and concerns. I ask and her answer was " we just went over that" RUDE! She keep running in and out of the room to talk to "Steve" not sure why. She didn't have any answers for me, was rude, kept telling how much it would. I had a bad feeling and told her I didn't want any treatment don. She says "ok I'll walk you out" I follow her and goes to back of the office with "Steve" again I was left in the middle of the office. The front desk lady (diff from the first) went to go get Margaret.  Margaret says to come back in a year. Front desk lady ask if I wanted to book from a year from now.  Margaret replies "no she can do it, oh unless you want to do it know" I paid and left. I felt so disrespected, discriminated service was horrible,  and Margaret was no help, rude,  and was extremely rushed to keep referring to " Steve" leaving in the room multiple times. NEVER RETURNING BACK OR REFERRAL PEOPLE.<//Text>< user_name>

t can be very scary getting anti-aging procedures done.  You can't help wonder – 'will I end up looking like a frozen faced freak?'  With Dr. Lee you can relax, she knows what she is doing. Every time she has given me a 'liquid facelift', my results are beautiful.  She gives just enough Botox, and just enough Restylane.  I look fabulous, not fake.  Stop searching and go see Dr. Lee.<//Review>

There is no one better for lasers. She is THE laser person out here. My rosacea is no longer a problem because of the laser treatments she's done on me. I also had 2 skin cancers on my face that she took care of for me with Mohs surgery. Having skin cancer  was very stressful but her office made the experience as easy as possible, and Dr. Lee took exceptional care of me. Highly recommend with no reservations.< /Review>

<Text>Bad service and overpriced. The lady was on the phone when I answered and was speaking in Spanish. And when I saw her in person, she was very rude. When I got there to get my nail off my tire they charged me over
$90 for 3 nails. Ripoff, you're better off going to Calderon's tires off bas com ave. Overall worst experience at a tire shop.< /Text>< pics>

This place used to sell their “Nankang” tires, brand new for about 80$ a piece. Just called to get an estimate on a set of 4, they’re now about 200$ a piece, says the lady on the phone..like how? Also my Spanish isnt the greatest and they was no one who spoke English available. Place is okay.</Review>

So of course we are in route on a time sensitive schedule when we get a flat tire on 22in tires at 630 on a Sunday. Wouldn't be right any other way right?! We truly found a gem of a shop. They took us in close to closing time and although we just came in for a patch they explained how it wouldn't last our journey (on a road trip to MD from Cali!) we got all new tires and rims at a very reasonable price. Not only did they check it once, not twice, but 3 times to make sure everything was perfect for our long drive across country. They stayed way beyond closing to make sure all was good and we didn't feel rushed not one minute. We feel safe now and are blessed to have found them. I highly recommend them and that is a big deal for someone whose expectations are always high. They did a great job!<//Review>

< Review>
Fastest and most efficient automotive repair center I've visited ever. The place has a friendly and professional staff who handle the paperwork and it's all done by the book. The techs were cool as hell and practically treat you like family. Ok I needed a service for my tire and "super cheap tires" couldnt help me nor could "calderons" anyways I searched and searched and luckily came across #LLANTAS NUEVAS Y USADAS#AAATireCenter# like GOD had just yelped me a blessing. Anyways come here it's worth the wait trust me. If you want an experienced technician slapping that rubber on your wheels this is your only hope. But, if you'd rather take the chance of newbee mechanic practicing on your wheels go right ahead. These vatos mean business believe that. GRACIASSSS<//Review>

When it comes to tires Rey knows his stuff. I was in need of some new tires bad. It was to the point that my tires where showing the wires. I searched on google and every shop told me they had cheap tires and that their service was good. But When I got there was no one to be found. (America tires, Sear) just to name a couple. It was getting late and every tire shop was already close. I did one last search and AAA Tires. I called and Rey the owner picked up. He told me to come. So I did. He hooked me up with it 4 new tiresbut he couldnt get them until the next day. So what he did after was super Fresh. He changed out all my Old tires and put On 4 spare tires. That way I would be able to go to work and not be worried if my tires were going to pop out on me. He told me to come back the next day and he'll have tires and that it would get done in an hour. What more can I say the man keeps his word. He got done and I was out in an hour. If ya'll need tires new or used hit him up. Hands down the best tire shop I've been to.<//Review>

<Text>The place looks shady and isn't affiliated to AAA. The technician demanded that I pick my torn tire myself from the trunk. To seem like value, he offered to verify whether my tire could be of use. He claimed its not and offered to replace it for 130$ for a used one! I said goodbye and took my car to the authorized agent instead and got it fixed for 30$.< /Text>< pictures>

<Review>This guy advertises his tires on facebook, craigslist, etc. I showed up for 4 partially used matching tires that I had pre-negotiated a price for and he actually had 2 near new and 2 completly bald tires waiting for me. No apology and didn't seem to care.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Rate>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service I went yesterday. Aser alignment to my truck. And they left me worse. I came back to be composed. And they reluctantly saw him ... and he was not seen. Besides. That when they put the truck on the ramp. The truck was shut up. The excuse they made was that the truck is too small. I don't recommend them. Not at all the worst place. What did I know ........

(Original)
Muy mal cervicio fui ayer. Aser alinecion a mi camioneta. Y me la dejaron peor. Regrese para que la compusieran. Y de mala gana lo isieron ..y no quedo vien . Aparte. Que cuando metieron la camioneta a la rampa. Se les callo la camioneta. La escusa que pusieron fue que la camioneta esta muy pequeña  .. No se los recomiendo.  Para nada el peor lugar. Que e conocido........< /Text>

(Translated by Google) The only thing I did not like about here was that a guy who works there took photos and video of my truck saying that they had financed the wheels which is a lie, I paid them at the moment, I think you should ask permission before publishing videos and photos of your car or truck and not give false information.

(Original)
Lo unico que no me gusto de aqui fue que un tipo que trabaja ahi le tomo fotos y video a mi troca diciendo que me habian financiado los rines lo cual es mentira,yo los pague al momento,creo que debe de pedir permiso antes de publicar videos y fotos de tu carro o troca y no dar informacion falsa.< /Text>

<Text>(Translated by Google) I do not recommend them ... they deceive people that they are cheap and that with the refinancing it will be easy but they do not tell me the truth they told me that I would only pay the price of the tires and wheels and that according to October 2018 I was going to finish paying and refinance now is charging me almost $ 3,000 dollars and I call them and they do not answer me although the payments are made on time I would say that they better buy them in another way so that they do not steal their money like me who charge me interest on interest ... they hook people with lies they are not cheap and they are charging me more, according to what I would only pay $ 1,350 for that I grabbed them but now they are almost $ 3,000 🤬🤬🤬🤬

(Original)
No se los recomiendo ... engañan ala gente con que son baratos y que con la refinanciera sera facil pero no les disen la verdad ami me dijeron que solo pagaria el precio de las llantas y los rines y que segun en octubre del 2018 iba a terminar de pagar y la refinanciera ahora me esta cobrando casi $3,000 dolares y les llamo y no me contestan aunque los pagos se asen a tiempo yo diría que mejor los compren de otra forma para que no les roven su dinero como ami que me cobran interes sobre interes ... enganchan ala gente con mentira no son baratos y me están cobrando de mas , segun solo pagaria $1,350 por eso los agarre pero ahora son casi $3,000 🤬🤬🤬🤬< /Text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< Resp>

Professional, friendly and FUN office. Do you enjoy sports? Holt's offices are full of photos, memorabilia and seats from Candlestick Park.  Fees envelop many services beyond the traditional orthodontic appointment. State of art equipment. Glad my dentist referred me to Holt Orthodontic.< /Review>

Each one of the individuals here had a great deal of expertise and care. I came in for a consult and was greeted warmly as if I were a regular. I was really surprised by their use of modern technology with 3D scanning and printing. It was really nice. Financially they seem to be comparable to many others in the area but have the added value of multiple locations and great deal of expertise. Would highly recommend to anyone considering braces or Invisalign<//text>

put on new glue on 2 of the teeth on my bottom retainer. The bottom middle teeth are sensitive due to a permanent retainer. She was friendly, efficient and updated me as she performed the procedure.
Dr. Holt is always fun to see and I rely on his expertise
in working with me on my permanent retainer.
Thank you to Holt Orthodontics!

I have been impressed, first with Dr Holt’s reputation (among others who work in the dental/orthodontic field), and second, after seeking him out, the way his office was very welcoming. It is decorated with a really fun sport motif!  I walked across the green ‘football field’ to have photos and X-rays taken, then have my teeth scanned. Dr Holt’s staff is amazing; very friendly and professional.  After that Dr Holt looked at my records and gave my teeth a very thorough exam. I am grateful he took the time to really analyze my teeth then give me his professional opinion.<//review>

< Review>
Okay let’s start out by saying no one likes to go to the doctor or orthodontist or even the dentist. BUT as humans hygiene is number 1. Not only is this office completely clean and sanitary, the customer service is amazing. The girls upfront are super nice and very respectful. Not to mention they are keeping precautions during this time with covid. Lobby is ALWAYS clean. They are making sure everything is six feet apart. Temp checks and hand sanitizer. The dental assistants are super nice, they can actually take a joke and joke back. Not that they aren’t professional because they are 100% professional and fun because they know how to balance it correctly. 100000000% recommend this place for adults and children.<//Review>

Holt Orthodontics is a wonderful office when facing braces for your child. The staff is professional,welcoming, and very friendly.  The environment is completely comfortable, non-intimidating and very enjoyable. The open floor plan helps to eliminate stress for the patients. My three children have had excellent care provided by all of the orthodontists there.  The financial manager takes ample time to help explain the financial aspect of the recommended care in a non-threatening manner. The front desk staff is cheerful , patient and accommodating.  The automated reminders via text makes it easy to never miss an appointment .
Without reservation I highly recommend Holt orthodontics when deciding on your care.< /Review>

If you need an excellent orthodontist please choose Holt! On my first visit, I was welcomed by friendly, knowledgeable staff who followed CDC guidelines. I felt completely taken care of throughout the consultation process for Invisalign by Dr. Tyler, Emily & Abby! The entire Folsom team work together seamlessly to provide excellent patient care! I highly recommend Holt Orthodontics!< /review>

I have had the best experience here. Front desk is great. The individuals that help with the finical stuff is great. The dental hygienist are great. Everyone is super sweet. I am 21 and in the medical field and they give the best costumer service. Definitely a great place to take your kids and even if you are 18 and above it’s a great place to go. The environment is great.<//Text>

The 24 months that I had my braces on went by so fast. I have a beautiful smile and had 4 star service from everyone from the gorgeous ladies at the front desk, Jasmine and "T" were always there with a hug and family updates when changing my wires.  Honestly,  they became a second family to me.

Now that my braces are off and I go for retainer checks, I miss them. I miss my morning laughs and karate updates, soccer game recaps and family vacation pictures.

Dr. Holt and company, you truly have an amazing team in Folsom and I would not trade my experience for all the money in the world.

Thank you for letting me be a part of your family.  Hugs and love to you all.

The Holt offices must have taken EVERY good idea and applied them all to their business! Both my kids have braces with Dr. Holt and they are always excited to go to appointments! The prize wheel, team shirts, earning points... it all adds up to a much easier time getting my kids to brush their teeth, take care of braces, wear retainers because they want to earn points! Thank you and your team for making parents lives easier by having a fun office experience as well as points they can earn at home by brushing, good grades and everything else you reward for!<//Review>

I highly recommend Holt Orthodontics. My son just got his braces off after 2 years. His was a rather complicated case requiring several gum surgeries with a Holt recommended doctor. All the way through the process Holt walked with him. They even saw my son over a weekend when one of his wires broke and was causing him too much pain. The average visit was between 20-30 minutes from the time he strolled in the door to the time he jogged out. They also worked with us to get a payment plan that we could afford. Excellent staff, very knowledgeable doctors and sweet receptionists made it a very good experience</Review>

< Review>
Over the past five years, two of my children have received treatments through Holt Orthodontics: both had braces, and for my daughter's second round of orthodontic treatment, she has Invisalign.  Holt Orthodontics has always provided clear information about their treatment plans, including what to expect and clear instructions about the portions that require self treatment (rubber bands, changing Invisalign aligners).  If you leave a message, you receive a prompt response, and they always make sure that your needs are met.  Their entire staff is friendly, professional and makes you feel like you are a part of the family. I'm sure my youngest will need orthodontic treatment at some point in time, and I look forward to returning to Hold Orthodontics when that time comes. Five stars isn't enough to give Holt Orthodontics my highest rating!<//Review>

< Review>
Everyone at Holt Orthodontics was wonderful to work with.  The office is very clean and fun! I came in for a second opinion to discuss TMJ and invisalign. They did a thorough review and fully explained all my options, and explained what results I could expect based on those options. They made me feel a lot more comfortable based on their realistic and straightforward discussions on orthodontic care. I'm so glad a friend referred me to Holt!< /Review>

< Review>
After being told that our daughter needed braces, we decided to get a few different opinions. Holt orthodontics was our third office that we chose to visit after seeing reviews online. I was very much impressed how friendly, and inviting the entire office was. But what impressed me most was the level of professionalism and How they took their time with us even though we weren’t their patient’s yet. With them nothing was forced, pressured or hurried but rather what would be in the best interest for my daughter. They took their time investigating her personal situation and making the best plan. This is such a rare and refreshing approach in the dental industry. I really appreciate the Holt orthodontist team. Thank you for making my daughter a unique and important patient to you.<//Review>

They are great about walking you through your treament plan, asking you what your concerns are and what would make you happy. The ladies are so kind and helpful, FUNNY!!! They treat everyone like family and take special care to remember the little things, like an upcoming trip or an exam. Made me feel like im heard and they care about me. I fly from chicago back to california every two months for my appointments because i love their services that much. I wouldnt switch and highly recommend them to everyone from adults looking for treatment to parents wanting someone to care for their children and teens.</text><Pictures>None</Pictures>< response>

<review>We have only been to the initial consult but were impressed by the friendliness and professionalism of the staff.  They took plenty of time to explain things and didn't rush us at all.   My son lives the sports themed office with autographed photos.  They even have my son a balloon and cupcake since it was the day of his birthday.  We will be back for sure.<//review></record>

<Text>The office is very appealing to people of all ages.   They are always so generous.  They have done my sons football mouth guard for free for the past 3 years. They are very accommodating for people who have busy schedules.  Have never been there waiting more than 5.minutes. very prompt service.   Would definitely  recommend  them for children and adult orthodontist.< /Text>< rate>

I took my daughter to the orthodontics today for the very 1st time.  Holt orthodontist is not like any orthodontist I've ever been to. They are by far the most kid centric, teen focused, as well as adult minded. My daughter is looking forward to each appointment there as they've made it so much fun.</review>

This is a wonderful practice! Patients and their families are greeted with a smile right when they walk through the door. The office staff, coordinators, dental assistants, and doctors are all fantastic. Both of my daughters are patients of this office and I am completely confident that their smiles are in fantastic hands.</Text>

I've been with this Dental Office for one year now.  And even though I live much closer to the Roseville location I drive to Folsom because of the superb customer service I receive there from every single person on staff/ The team is great and I always leave there with a smile on my face.
Thank You</review>

I really love this orthodontist because all the workers r sooo nice and they even have a little snack station and iPads in their waiting area! I love how they've been working on my teeth and they even explain different things to me so that i know exactly what they're doing. I love this orthodontist!!</review>

Is it not at all suspicious that everyone gave 5 stars except 1 person? not to mention that almost everyone who's reviewed this have only had 1 review: for holt ortho. They don't rlly have lots of profile pics either. just the same review over again: "I loved Holt and his staff!! Would recommend!!!!!!!!!" idk man im sure it's a good office and I'm not accusing them of fake reviews, just a little sus in my opinion<//Text></record></dataset><record>

From the very first time we visited Dr. Holt's and Dr. Annello's practice, and met with their outstanding staff, it was the best experience in ANY office we've ever experienced.  Everyone was extremely courteous, kind, open and friendly!  Everything about their procedures and their very kind care of my two sons was explained thoroughly and with understanding.  My boys LOVE going the orthodontist, and usually can't wait until their next appointment, especially my youngest, lol!  I would highly recommend and promote Dr. Holt, Dr. Annello and their staff!!!< /text>

<text>Although braces are NOT fun, I have to say Drs. Holt and Annello, and staff are!  They give me the motivation to hang in there and get er done!   I always walk out of the office feeling cared for and on the road to success.    My teeth are looking great and I look forwards to the day they say "done".

I would give this review a 5 star, but that says 'Loved it'.....but I can't say that cause braces are hard.  But, as for the staff and all, they get a 5 star!< /text>< Pics>

<Text>In as much as one can love a doc appt, I am happy with this office and its care.  Every time I call to make an appt, Mary at the front desk remembers my name and who I am and chats with me.  She makes sure that the appt works for me and when I arrive I get the same welcome from her and others on staff.  I have had retainer follow ups with Dr. Holt, who took over Dr. Kilmer's practice, the person I started with years ago.  I have had good care from Dr. Holt and his reasonableness on retainer wear is a nice change from the wear every day till you croak, which is what I got as a teenager.  I would definitely recommend this staff for its orthodontia care and friendliness.  If you have to go thru braces and retainers, you might as well do it with a staff and doc that know what they are doing and make your treatment and visits pleasant.< /Text>< pics>

<Text>Absolute worst customer service at this location. The routinely will not answer their phone and then leave it off the hook so nobody can call in orders. I’ve never heard of a place that neglects their jobs in such a fashion! And just now when pulling up to the drive through to place my order I see multiple employees sitting down on their phones and only one employee actively working! This is unacceptable if I were management I would be looking into new staff...<//Text><pics>None< /pics><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Employees are so RUDE here. They always got a bad attitude and are not no where near good at customer service. I got asked to wait for a pizza for 15 mins and when i picked it up it was wrong order.<//text>

If I can give it zero, I would. I waited at the drive thru window for about six minutes and I know they saw me. A worker was mingling at the front register after she completed their order instead of coming and assisting me. After she finished talking to them, she didn’t even come and help me, another worker noticed that I was in the drive thru and when she opened the window she didn’t even greet me or apologize for the wait. She whispered something but I couldn’t understand because my cars quiet little engine was louder than her. I asked for a deep dish and she said that’ll be ten min in hopes of me saying I’ll just take a regular pizza instead and so I said ok, that’s fine and she looked so annoyed that I didn’t take something that was already ready. Poor customer service

Update : I just went back to the drive thru to pick up my pizza after waiting in the parking lot for about 15 min and she said oh I’m so sorry we haven’t started your pizza yet it’ll be about another 15 min< /Text>

The cashiers are great and very friendly. The pizza is good when you get the ones that are out of the oven, otherwise sometimes you get the ones that have been there a while and crust is a bit hard. Other than that it's a great place to pick up a pizza.</Text>

When i first moved here to San Diego from Ventura i was missing the music store i used to visit. I walked into Mr. Joeys when they were still located in Lemon Grove. They made me feel comfortable and the positive vibe of the place did remind me of the place i used to visit. Joey and Rudy are cool people. Feels good to have a place like this. Music store with a soul and personality unlike the corporate big box ones that take the fun out playing music.< /review>

I think they do rentals as well. Their rehearsal studios are great and can accommodate from individuals to multiple people or a whole band.

I have been taking singing lessons weekly with Rudy for over a year.  I learned how to project my voice and breathe appropriately in the first few lessons.  We work the solid hour; not a forty five min. hour.

Mr. Joey is honest, down to earth, and very helpful.   His inventory of musical instruments is vast.  I discover new and used gems in the store regularly.</review>

<Text>I met Rudy Vasquez through Craigslist. He's the best voice coach I have had . My first singing lessons went well and I can sing and project my voice more than I ever expected. I'm more confident about my singing abilities and eventually want to sing in a band. Rudy can teach anyone to sing . I never thought I could sing! My voice has a range I never knew.

Joey and Rudy also know all about musical equipment and only sell the best quality .< /Text>< resp>

Amazing service!  Great prices and nice selection of acoustics.  If your are shopping around, do yourself a favor and visit them before you make a decision.

Thanks Joey!< /Review>

Unfortunately we were not able to stay at this beautiful vacation rental because of a medical emergency that came up the day we were suppose to arrive. Called later that day to let them know, with no intentions of getting my money back but I was met with so much kindness. They refunded me the total amount.. cannot recommend working with better people! Looking forward to staying in the future!< /review>

We stayed at this property for a month. It was clean and well stocked. The few issues we had were handled quickly and resolved. Burr White was great and responsive. Great location, quiet yet close to the beach. We took our dog and it was nice to walk around the neighborhood with him. Parking was great and a bonus to have washer and dryer available. Would definitely stay again.<//text>

They even called me while we were staying there to make sure everything was to our liking. Couldn’t have asked for better customer service! The property was gorgeous! And was the perfect location! Right next to the beach, Balboa pier and Balboa boardwalk. House was clean, organized, and had everything we needed to enjoy our time there! I highly recommend this property or any property that Burr White Realty has! You won’t be disappointed! Will definitely use them again for my vacation needs!< /Review>< Pictures>

Sara at Burr White was amazing! She always responded to us, took care of our needs, and helped us in any situation. I would recommend staying at any property with Burr White. It’s always clean and has great locations. Staying at a 9 month winter lease was one of the best decisions. Hopefully we get to do it again at some point!< /review>

<Review>DO NOT RENT at 115 39th street.  The one main problem is the permanent resident who lives next door.  We stayed there this summer and on the first day at 2 in the afternoon she came over and yelled at my sister in law, telling her she was a permanent resident and the kids running around was NOT OK.  If you are going for a family vacation with kids who want to run around and play, I do not recommend this place.  It was an OK property.  The detail to cleanliness didn’t seem high on the priority list as there were smooshed Oreos under the glass table.  The sheets were stained(clean I’m sure) just stained.  They had no dust pans in either unit and the bathroom door in unit A downstairs has no lock.  We used to work with Burr White Realty quite often. When we booked 115 39th last year, it was owned by another rental company so it is a newer rental property for Burr White.  We started using a different realty company as they were easier to work with making credit card payments and had lower fees.  I will say, every time we had an issue this year(stove top didn’t work and no hot water for a day) they came pretty quickly to fix.  The gas line was shut off.  If it hadn’t been for the resident who lived next door it would have been a pretty good experience.  I’m sure if you rent through Burr White you will have a fine experience.  No one was ever rude and as I said, they had people come fairly quickly when we had a problem.  I’m glad we were able to make it a fun trip despite the neighbor.< /Review>< name>

Incredible service!! My family and I have tried other rentals, and this was by far the best. You can't go wrong with them. The house was beautiful and whenever we needed something, they got it to us as soon as possible. You'll have a wonderful time;)<//text>

We recently stayed at a Burr White rental property in Newport Beach during the Spring Break weekend. The Burr White staff (Sara) was extremely helpful and responsive. The location was absolutely amazing, and the property was very well kept. My wife and I maintain relatively high standards in many regards, and this property met our expectations. The property was accurately described in the listing, and the configuration was very good. If there was anything that was not 100%, it was the WiFi and low clearance/tight fit for the parking. The WiFi signal was weak toward the rear of the home, but we enjoyed the outdoors most of the time anyway, and the parking is not conducive to lifted vehicles and a bit of a tight fit from the street (alley), so it was recommended (Sara) that we back into the space. Nevertheless, a very good experience overall, and we will be back during the summer.< /review>

Advice, do not do business over the phone without documentation, no matter the smallest detail that is promised by them that 'would not be a big deal'. Although their short term rental department is fantastic!< /review>

We were very pleased to spend a week in a Burr White Vacation rental last week. We were extremely happy with the service of the Burr White staff, the sophisticated and  thorough check in system and the conditions of the contract to ensure we would  be good neighbors during our stay. We very much enjoyed our visit at the home right on the sand in Newport Beach.</Review>

Burr White worked with the property owners so that my rental amount was not lost but rather rolled over to next summer.  A very fair outcome and one that I could not have achieved without Burr White's involvement.  This is but one of the many reasons that I've been renting from Burr White for over 20 years.  Oh, BTW, both my sons are fully recovered.<//text>< pics>

< review>
I am a Home Owner and started using Burr White about a year ago.  They have a team of friendly and responsible people who are always a the ready.  Their business is dealing with families on vacation (or a Covid "get-a-away") and property owners--both I imagine are stressful.  They represent beach houses that are used by families for weeks or months.  The upkeep is immense from garage clickers, screens that rip, dishwashers that break, etc. they have to deal with it all IMMEDIATELY.

They do a professional job, communicate with me when needed and a joy to work with.  I would recommend hiring them.<//review>

I've rented from Burr White numerous times.  I rented the last place for a friend coming into town from Montana.  She was freaked out by how crowded it was and said she'd prefer to stay in a hotel with a little more room.  I was surprised of course, who doesn't want to stay at the beach.  I put them up in a hotel and called Burr White to see what the options where regarding a refund.  They offered to credit the entire amount and the conversation was really easy.  Thanks Burr White!</Text>

Recently we felt that we needed to cancel our reservations for accommodations for our entire family—children, spouses, and grandchildren—in Newport Beach for the summer of 2020 due to the pandemic. Burr White employees were extremely accommodating and refunded our entire deposit within 3-4 days. We look forward to trying again for another year. Their customer service is top-notch! Highly recommend!< /Text>

<text>The employees at Burr White Realty were all very friendly, professional and helpful. They took the time to explain everything to us and never appeared to be irritated even after multiple calls to them. And then when our plans didn’t work out for medical reasons, they worked with us and helped us with a refund. We couldn’t ask for anything more. We will for sure use Burr White the next time we are looking for a place to stay at in Newport Beach.</text>< name>

Unfortunately we were unable to follow through with our summer rental.
We have used Burr White many times and have never been disappointed.
The staff is very professional, informative and a pleasure to work with.
Upon hearing of the problems with COVID 19, we were nervous about our Aug. rental. I spoke with Kerry about this and first she calmed me down then let me know all my options.
She was so helpful. We decided to cancel and look toward next year.
We emailed them for a refund and received An immediate response. Within days we were refunded our deposit.
It was so easy we really appreciated their prompt attention.
I realize this was a once in a life time experience and they helped us through this.
You can’t go wrong with Burt White staff.
See you next year.

I rented a beach front condo from Burr White Newport Rentals offseason in 2020.

The property management company was not a very responsive management company, especially when it came to COVID-19 and the panic that my family and I were dealing with.

During the COVID-19 Pandemic Newport Rentals refused to reimburse us on the unused time of our rental, despite the governor’s stay at home orders and the rental could not be used during this time.

I would not recommend using Newport Rentals for renting a long term property in Newport Beach. I was extremely unsatisfied with my experience, and will not use them again.

Edited to add: I'm not giving my real name on this website, I talked to Sarah in the Newport office, she is who we delt with in March regarding the COVID-19 Shut Downs. She was awful to deal with.<//Review>

<Review>Recently I listed a property in Costa Mesa CA. The staff at Burr White Realty was instrumental in this particular transaction where there were several twist and turns. They were always courteous, professional and patient as we maneuvered through a fraught divorce situation. The broker and entire staff handled the transaction with much integrity and poise which unfortunately is hard to find in industry. They went above and beyond to ensure the transaction went smoothly and everyone was extremely happy. Burr White utilized their experience and knowledge to facilitate the deal and reassure the client. I would recommend Burr White Realty to anyone who values honesty, integrity and a seamless transaction.< /Review>< Response>

They recommended us 3104 W. Oceanfront. We rented both units for the whole family. The units were very nice and clean. Right on the sand with a beautiful view. Couldn't ask for more.

We requested extra items for the kitchen and Kim very kindly delivered them for us. Burr White's team is very professional and certainly we will  come back next year.<//text>< Pictures>

We unfortunately were not able to go on our beach trip due to COVID 19 restrictions. Burr White was so helpful in helping us cancel and getting a refund. We are so bummed to miss our trip and when we are able to travel again we will for sure use Burr White for our housing needs.

The worst property manager to deal with in all of OC. These people are a joke. Extremely slow at responding to maintenance requests, not actually fixing all of the issues when maintenance finally does show up. Expect terrible communication on any and every issue. Shady business practices to top it all off. I highly DO NOT recommend doing business with this company. If you are thinking of renting from a Burr White managed property, save yourself a huge hassle and walk away.</Text>

We can highly recommend Burr White’s vacation rental services! Burr White went above and beyond to find us the perfect vacation rental for our Christmas holidays. The property they recommended for us exceeded our expectations, the customer service provided by Kerri was superior, the check in procedure was handled professionally, the rental unit was spotless, well appointed, and maintained to a high standard. We will definitely return to Burr White for our future vacation rental needs and recommend them to our friends and business associates.</Text>

<review>In February 2020 we reserved a beach home for four days for a family baby shower and beach time. I paid in full for the rental at that time.  I signed a contract with Burr White which stated it was non-refundable after a certain period of time passed. I was out of the cancellation period. Due to Covid19 and the death of my children's father we had to cancel the planned baby shower.  I made on call and email to Burr White and they immediately refunded me the money no questions, no arguing, no questioning I was so amazing that within 12 hours the money was returned to my ATM card.  I cannot thank Burr White enough for their kindness and understanding as well as professionalism.  I cannot wait until Covid is over so we can reschedule our family beach trip.   Thank you all at Burr White especially Jane!!!!< /review>< Response>

Place looked nice but that's about it. fans didn't work, busted screen, stove had issues with starter not turning off. Toilet overflowed up and was told "we'll come by tomorrow" or we can charge you for an emergency call. We're actually leaving 1 day early because of all the issues!

Spent the weekend in Newport Beach with a group of 8 friends.  The property we stayed in was very nice and perfectly accommodated all of us comfortably.  The check in - check out process was quick and easy.
Our property was right on the beach with a beautiful view.  The layout of the house was very spacious with plenty of bathrooms.
I would rent with this company again.< /Text>

<review>If you're looking for a good service, do not look here. This office is very difficult to deal with and absolutely rude to customers trying to rent properties on the coast. I've yet to speak with a good realtor here or experience good customer service. (I apologize for not selling/buying a house?) They act like you're wasting their time, cut you off and even complain about a lot of the owners of the properties. I'd highly recommend using another beach house rental office, as these ladies are less interested in helping you than they are themselves. I'd also recommend that if you do use this office, get straight to the point, no questions or inquiries, pay and go. Otherwise they will sigh loudly, talk over you and do not want to assist you. They are also very age discriminatory and are rude to anyone and everyone under 30.< /review><Pics>None</Pics><Resp>{'time': 1505291107736, 'text': 'We are sincerely sorry that you had such a negative experience while dealing with our staff.

Very unprofessional. Took almost a week for them to get back to me after so many emails and voicemails. Would not recommend there’s are better leasing companies with better policies and customer service. Not tenant orientated and very unpleasant stay. Would give 0 stars if possible.< /Text>

We had an excellent experience with them. The office staff was very helpful, they even shipped us back items we forgot. At one point we messed up the TV and they arrived to fix it right away.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

I cannot stress enough how horrible this company is and how you must not walk, but run from any possible interaction with them. I am a Home Owner, and didn't choose to do business with them, but the property management company I was working with, was purchased by them and they inherited my business.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

They will happily say flowery things to lull you to trusting them, and then once your in bed with the snakes they will bleed you and ignore your requests. It required much more time and effort to get a response from them on almost every occasion that i needed assistance.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

I was completely ripped off by their monthly Handyman fees that were well over the normal quotable costs for work. I am sure that someone must be married to the Larry Thomas, the Handy Man that made quiet a good living repairing things on the home. Especially after spending 3,000 preparing it for new tenants less than a year ago. I pay a monthly gardener to maintain dead grass in the back yard. I understand, they don't want water damage on their equipment, but they should adjust the tasks and cost as a result of the needs, and certainly note this for the fact the tenants will need to be responsible for the lawn replacement when they leave.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

I hired a property management team so that i didn't need to stay on top of the daily issues that arise. This is what they are paid to do. Handle my affairs. But their concern is for money and not for services. My home was empty for a couple months costing me a small fortune, and I was the one pushing for updates to keep them working instead of letting it sit while they tended to other business. Then they blame me because the cost is too hight and they are the ones that suggested the price.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

They continually left emails unanswered. I was forced to follow up repeatedly. They do not do as requested. I planned for several weeks to make a visit to the home while in the country, they never informed the tenant causing unneeded stress as a result of their last minute attempts to clean up their lack of follow thru.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

I had to CC the President on emails to get them to properly attend to the requests I had, like the employees where school children needing monitoring. The lack or professional email correspondence was distressing for someone that lives out of the country and has to rely on that as a means of communication due to the time change.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

I am so relieved to be working with a new company that takes customer service and satisfaction seriously. If you plan to work with them, be sure to check your contracts and follow up on everything yourself. You cannot trust the service they will provide you. I guarantee they will disappoint you.

DO NOT TRUST THEM

<resp>{'time': 1539643385713, 'text': 'Thank you for your comments.  We are sorry your experience this past year was less than satisfactory.  Of course, living in France with the time changes and very limited phone conversation complicated our efforts to timely resolve any issues we may have had via email only.  Our company has been in business in the same location for over 50 years and currently manages hundreds of rental properties.  We currently successfully represent hundreds of owners and receive many referrals from satisfied owners.  Some owners have worked with us for over 20 years.  All our owner interface is digital, including owner statements and rental deposits.  All invoices are accessible on line 24 hours each day through an owner portal.  "Remember, we were the ones who terminated our relationship, not you."  Why?  We were unable to effectively communicate, consequently, we were unable to provide the timely attention your account required.  Your characterization of the service provided is unfair and one-sided.  When you state "you were not once satisfied with our work" your credibility is strained.  Any fair mined person can see your comments are personal and inflammatory.  It may be of interest to you our contractors are independent, licensed and bonded and have plenty of work.  Because of the volume of work our contractors receive from us, their billing is discounted.  We do not add a surcharge to any contractor billing.  We make no money via contractors.  Furthermore, charges for all work performed can be viewed via the owner portal.  We felt that it was in the best interest of both parties to end our management relationship.  We are sorry you were upset (you posted more than one negative review) "we terminated our agreement," we really had no choice.  We strive to provide all our owners and tenants the highest level of service.  On the rare occasion our differences cannot be resolved we suggest you be successful with another company (We referred you several companies closer to your property). We view your comments as a learning experience.  We wish you well.'}</resp></record>

Craig Batley and Joan Trout are opportunistic business people who take advantage of the trust they have as realtors and property managers. Worse is Lori Ring and Mark Jackson and Traighe. They promise to fix and clean houses before moving in then run out of time but force tenants to keep the move in date or lose the lease. Then they send Larry and Gary to pretend to fix appliances that don't work and overflowing toilets and heaters plus water heaters than suddenly stopped working, blink blink. Lori Ring outright lies about receiving rent checks and signed papers when they were handed to her just as she asked for. Nope, this outfit is not good. They ruined our vacation plans. When I called the California Department of Real Estate the investigators said they got a lot of complaints about Burr White and tell everybody to get a lawyer and sue. The DRE can't get money back for deceived tenants and Burr White has a reputation for not being open to reason or giving people back their deposits. Do yourself a favor and work through your own realtor and property manager.<//Text>

Love this place! Very convenient right off of the 5 freeway heading south in Orange County. This store is kept very clean by team members. They have a charging station that locks your device inside it to charge while you walk around and shop. Visit this location on average twice a month. Calvin Klein is a great brand and their clothing seems to last long.<//text>

<review>Very bad customer service. Does not look friendly at all and they are not happy to help at all. Honestly I was so disappointed and hardly have this type of service. I must buy a gift for the person I know loves this brand ,so I try not too get very upset,other than I definitely leave the store and never come back :(((((<//review></record>

<text>Really nice clothes and good prices.  So why 3 stars?   One item was clearly defective on the rack.  I told them and they removed it.  They should have seen it before putting it out.  I also got the dreaded 404 error trying to connect to their free wifi.  Well its just my opinion.< /text></record></dataset><record>

(Translated by Google) I think clothes are very cool and the prices of most of the products are very good, especially in the sales part you get to find very good opportunities!
It is worth investing time in that store and you will surely find some great deals.

(Original)
Me parece ropa muy padre y los precios de la mayoría de los productos es muy bueno, sobre todo en la parte de liquidaciones llegas a encontrar oportunidades muy buenas!
Vale la pena invertir tiempo en esa tienda y seguramente encontrarán excelentes ofertas.</review>

<Text>Tom and his crew at Anchor Auto Body made the process of having my car repaired very easy for me, once they had the car the worked with my insurance and handled everything.  They kept me updated on the status if repair and when my car would be ready.  After getting car back we noticed something was off when we did the oil change and Tom had me take the car back in and he checked it and even put it on the lift and had us go back with him to see what we were talk8ng about, come to find out the car had been in an accident previously that I was unaware of since I only had car for 3 months. Tom was very helpful and I appreciate him taking the time to show us what was wrong and it had nothing to do with why my car was there to start with. Thank you Anchor Auto Body for such good work and going the extra mile.</Text>< Name>

Fair prices, quality job, amazing customer experience. I came in on a referral from a long-standing customer and I can now see why my friend recommended them. Please support this family-owned, fabulous small business.

I went in to repair a scuff on the front bumper and replace a windshield on a Dodge Challenger. Alma was my estimator and was so kind, professional and sharp. She gave me a fair estimate and was transparent about the price breakdown. They did not try to overcharge me or upsell me. Customer service was amazing and both jobs were impeccable. They even dropped me off at home and delivered my car (cleaned and vacuumed) to my home upon completion of the services. I received text message updates regarding the job status and estimates, which was just a really nice touch. Anchor also worked with me when I had schedule conflicts and needed to keep the car in the shop for an extra night. It's the little things, ya know?< /Review>< date>

I had very positive experience with the staff, and also final work came out very nicely.  They kept updating me constantly via emails. AAA referred this shop to fix the front bumper after an accident. When I got the vehicle on time first after fixing, there was a slight misalignment on one side of the bumper. It should have been captured in quality inspection. The staff promptly addressed my concerns.< /text>

<review>Tom the Manager/Owner is really amazingly helpful. I was just calling around to find a place that can do a specific job, and he was very honest with me about pricing, even had some suggestions of places, and even took a few mjnutes to go over some details explaining how the process works. Im very thankful for him taking the time with me, practically giving me a Free Consultation over the phone, even though he knew I'd be going elsewhere for this kind of job. Now I feel I can move forward more confidently with my decision making. He just sounds like a Good Guy! THANX TOM!< /review><userid>112324919337481379126<//userid>< Rate>

I always bring my cars to ANCHOR AUTO BODY located in the city of Sunnyvale. They have repaired all my vehicles (6 times) for the past 15 years and have always kept the same quality when it comes to service. Courtesy is a “BIG PLUS“ when it comes to its Customer Service personnel. Now if someone will ask me: which Auto Body shop would you recommend then? I’d say: Try somewhere else so you can regret it forever for not using Anchor Auto Body in Sunnyvale the very first time. A short story: As a Lyft and Uber driver, I picked up this gentleman 4-5 months ago at the Anchor Auto Body shop. He was going back home while his car was serviced. Home was Gilroy (45 minutes away). I couldn’t believe the distance. I have asked him: what brought you so far from home? His answer was this: I always bring all my cars to this body shop regardless of distance. I trust them because they are very professional. You don’t wanna know all the  trouble I had to face several times using other body shops. That’s why  End of story.<//Text>

They rarely told me any news of the car's repairs for 3 weeks or more, and it just lead to me paying for a rental longer than I would have liked. They also didn't really fix anything, even after I issued them photographic proof that the dents etc were not from a previous owner.
I basically paid them to take off the bumpers and put them back on with slightly worse quality tape than last time.</review>

<text>Great service and amazing job. Replaced door on my Honda pilot. very nice people, clear communication: what and when can be completed. Finally the result is above any expectations: installation, paint job is top notch. Guys fixed me couple of dents, even without asking me, for no charge! Really impressed.

Honest business which is very successful. Great job, guys, and thank you!<//text><pictures>None</pictures><response>None< /response><gmap_id>0x808fb6fc7f411c81:0x2acffcd38cf044db< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Good repair, horrible customer service. No updates on the car, called several times during business hours to no response. They told me the car would be done in a week, and now it has been close to 3 weeks and still no response. We also were told the car would be totaled but they fixed one side with an estimate, to then say the other side needed to be fixed and would take another week. Very disappointed and cannot recommend them.</review>

This body shop is a very professional. I was really upset because my coworker hit my car in the parking lot of all places. They offered me some tea, and were very comforting.

What I did not like about them was no communication. I had to call them constantly to find out what was going on with my car.< /text>

Their estimator Miguel V is awesome.  He was patient and taught me what needs to be done to fix my car.  He even asked his expert to come out to give an independent second opinion which matched what he originally recommended.  He made some manual adjustments to prove to me what needs to be fixed!! Miguel is obviously an experienced mechanic turned into a great salesman and representative for Anchor Auto Body. At Fremont's "Everything body shop" (where they bragged that they are rated #1) the owner wanted $10,000 to cut and replace.  At another Sunnyvale shop  owned by an Indian - he would not take my tough case.  In contrast Miguel told me that Anchor guarantees their work and gave me the best solution and value!<//Text>

<Review>Fixed my bright orange Fiat 500e and detailed the outside and inside so it looks new. They repaired some damage where they could have ordered new parts, saving on cost. And the quality of the work was top notch and completed in half of their time estimate. Everyone I interacted with was pleasant, intelligent, and treated me with respect. The waiting room is nice and clean with TV and WiFi. I would definitely use them again (but hope I don't have to).< /Review><Resp>None< /Resp>< date>

Service representative  Danny was very knowledgeable, polite and was very prompt in responding to my e-mail questions.  The repairs were finished a day ahead of time and there were additional polishing and scratches removed which were not part of the estimate and were not charged.
I recommend them highly and I am a repeat customer< /review>

<text>Anchor Auto Body was extremely accommodating while I was having some work done on my car. One of the staff was able to drop me off to work and pick me up when it was finished. He was very friendly, very happy with the customer service and my car looks great!</text></record>

Absolutely superb customer service and followup. They met the committed deadline for completion of the body damage repair...and WOW I was amazed at the quality of the work. My car looks new (it is a 1999) and the body repairs, exterior paint were spectacular. I had the owner Tom personally handling my customer service and he took care of the insurance billing. Thank you!!</text>

<text>this is our second time in with anchor auto body, I brought in my best friend since he just had a car accident not long ago and had to get his own car fixed since he was the one who caused the accident. Any how I am really upset at that but I am glad we have anchor auto to deal with. I came with them about a year ago to get a few fixes and I was really happy with my own results that I didn’t bother to hesitate in bringing my own friend here. Like I recommended him I honestly can recommend anyone!<//text></record></dataset><record>
<review>I accidentally hit a side of my car with a side pole coming out of a parking spot. I couldn’t had believe I had done that to my new car by not looking. I decided to take my car in immediately to a place to get it fixed. I was referred from my friend to come in to Anchor and I am happy to have come here. They did a great job!< /review><gmapID>0x808fb6fc7f411c81:0x2acffcd38cf044db</gmapID>< pics>

<resp>None</resp><Pics>None</Pics><Time>1444604728492< /Time><Text>Overall, Anchor did an excellent job repairing my vehicle in a prompt manner once I finally dropped it off. From a customer service perspective, however, they dropped the ball multiple times, and I was very disappointed with them, and I would not go back unless I am able to communicate more clearly with the repair shop.

Anchor is apparently a Mercury-approved repair facility. I was in a rear-end accident which did not require significant work, with no structural damage, and only largely cosmetic damage to my rear bumper. I'd already worked things out with Mercury, who'd accepted liability for the accident, and recommended this shop. I called the shop, who told me to come out, which I did.

They did a quick estimate, and told me that they'd reach out to Mercury to confirm that it was okay to fix my car. I asked if I should leave the car there. They said no. I thought this was odd, but they said that I should't leave my car until Mercury confirmed. This being the end of the day on a Monday, they said they'd email me my estimate tonight (they failed to do that) submit it to Mercury and get back to me the next day (they also failed to do that). So I went back to work, thinking I'd just wasted a lot of time driving out, getting the car looked at, and accomplishing nothing, then going back to work. Mercury happens to call me asking why I haven't dropped off the car. I told them that the shop told me not to, and Mercury says the shop should not have told me that. I'm peeved.

After not hearing anything all day Tuesday, the shop calls me back on Wednesday and let me know Mercury will pay for it after all. I need to go back and drop off the car now. We set up an appointment for Monday.

On the next Monday, I call to say I'm going to drop off the car. They can't seem to remember me for a while, but then discover they haven't ordered parts. I'm glad they told me, otherwise I'd have wasted another trip over there. We set up another appointment for the following Monday.

Finally, the next Monday, I drop off the car, two weeks after the initial estimate. By now I'm rather upset, as this is the third time I've blocked off time on my calendar to go to this shop. I fill out some forms, and they say they'll email with progress. I get zero updates, and finally a voicemail where they say they're finishing up my car a few days later. I can't tell if they're finished from the voicemail, so I have to call them again to confirm it's actually done, not just almost done. Finally, I go pick it up. At least they washed the exterior and vacuumed the interior, though they didn't do a great job, since I have bird poop streaks on my hood still. Guess I'll need another wash.

Long review, mediocre experience. I didn't give fewer stars because the actual car-fixing is what is most important, and that was done rather well. I guess that's something.<//Text>< rating>

Primarily came to frame a canvas picture. The price was great and the quality was awesome. Associate helped me pick the frame and mat and design it the way I wanted. Price was good enough for me to spring for the museum quality glass too.< /text>< response>

They are very friendly and if you can't find something they will help you find whatever it is you are looking for.  If they don't have it, they will not only check when the order comes in, they will make sure what you need is on order.  Personable and people pleasers - ALL THE WAY!!!!<//text>

I absolutely love love love Hobby Lobby. They have everything possible if you have a creative mind. The quality of products are excellent and the selection is outstanding.  If you are into Christmas and the other holidays you will find everything here to make your holiday a spectacular event.  Their prices are amazing and you can always get a 40% discount coupon you can use on any non sale item emailed to you if you sign up.   Just a word of caution!  Schedule a lot of time to go there because once you are in you do not want to come out.</text>

The staff was very helpful. Sometimes it could take a little while tot track someone down but they are very helpful once you get them.

Primarily came to frame a canvas picture. The price was great and the quality was awesome. Associate helped me pick the frame and mat and design it the way I wanted. Price was good enough for me to spring for the museum quality glass too.< /text>

< Review>
I needed a frame for a pic of my mom who just passed.
The man working the custom frame counter was a great help to me.
I asked him how long would it take to make me a frame? He said two weeks.
I told him I needs it in 3 days!!
He helped me pick an off the shelf frame, and made a custom border so that the picture fit properly. It was an odd size.
He did a great job! Made the pic look great!!
I didn't I regrettably didn't get his name! I wish I would have.
But this man made all the difference.  And Hobby Lobby has my patronage from here on out because of it..<//Review>

<Review>Don't get me wrong..love hobby lobby.  But when you ask a worker where to find an item and they point you in the wrong area and place it really stinks. I assume she was new but she just said over there in the paper area.... Really..rows and rows of paper products. No help at all. I looked it up on my phone and found it myself... In the sewing area...
If you're not sure , just say so or ask another worker. Whewww<//Review>< rate>

They did not have a good selection. Looked like they were going out of business.
I could not seem to find any store employee help for long moments at a time.
When I did get help, they weren't very knowledgeable and seemed disinterested in helping me.
If it wasn't for the one employee that helped me at the end, they would've gotten less than 3 stars!
I would recommend trying a different location, or try Michael's.<//Review>

Love everything in this store! It is like a Homegoods, Michaels, and other crafty store, all-in-one. They are already fully stocked with Christmas decorations which is lovely to see.< /Review>

<pictures>None< /pictures><text>Love this store. We shop here for weddings,  baby showers, birthday parties and any other special holidays or occasions.  Store is well organized. I can ask any employee at this store where a certain item is that I am looking for, and they can direct me or walk me to the aisle I need to go to. Five stars all the way. I also like that they close on Sundays, so their employees can be with their families.< /text>< Response>

If this hobby lobby was any slower they’d have to write my obituary.

Seriously the lines here always are terrible. I’m not sure how their cashiers are so incompetent, but they are.

It’s a decent hobby lobby other than that but not worth the wait.</Review>

<Review>This was my first visit to Hobby Lobby, and was very impressed with their huge store and variety. Prices are reasonable, and some of the items I was looking for were on sale. The employees are helpful and courteous. The restrooms are immaculate. Definitely worth the 13 mile drive from home.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None</resp><gmap_id>0x80c329acc54cef1d:0x421d26c131d77185< /gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

It has everything you might be looking for. But the price point is insane. Overall experience: I was amazed by how well organized and beautiful that place is but taken back by the price range. Not for those looking for affordable alternatives..< /text>

<Text>It's a great place. Usually a perfect place, but on my most recent visit I was disappointed in their Revell model paint color selection. Had a list of 12 I needed and they only had 4 of them. But yes, generally a great place.</Text><UserId.>105274905018985471659< /UserId.><Rating>4< /Rating>< pics>

<review>Horrible management here! Probably the most horrible and humiliating experience in my life. Not only overcharged me for an item but insisted that I did not pay for it because the price did not match the receipt. Had me and my mom waited twice for a total over 40 minutes when they went to check their security camera.  The security manager even raised the flower to my face questioning me why I had it if I didn’t purchase it, totally treating me like a criminal. Thanks God when they checked the camera for the second time they finally realized that the cashier made a mistake, otherwise I would have been considered a thief. Not to mention they were giving me the cold shoulder and long face from the very beginning, contrary to when they were being nice and friendly to the previous customer. Felt being discriminated and humiliated, not to mention wasted my time and my mom’s time! Management did not  even offer an apology. Honestly I don’t blame the cashier who charged the wrong item, everyone makes mistakes, but how the management handled the situation was totally disappointing. I used to like this store, but will never ever come back again! Would have given 0 star if I could!</review></record>

<review>I think I could spend all day here lol they have so many cute things and Christmas is here already along with all the fall decorations. Make sure to check out what days they discount certain departments cause I saw a 40% off Christmas decor. I could easily over spend here with pretty much everything from furniture to coffee cups they will have something you like.<//review><Response>None</Response><date>1568401922285< /date><rating>5< /rating><user_name>Paulette D< /user_name>< userid>

<text>Loved  this store.
Very organized, clean, friendly staff.
Some items are pricey .
I support their beliefs to be closed on Sundays.
That was how if use to be . Just about all places of business were closed on Sundays. Dept. Stores, banks.etc.
One had to do all between Monday thru Saturday.
Banks were not open on Saturday.
Good for you Hobby Lobby, many people believe as you do.< /text>< Pictures>

So many different choices for activities and hobbies. Not a place you can quickly stop by. You must have some time if you want to see it all. It's actually overwhelming. I haven't gotten a chance to see it all because I stop looking when I reach the max I can spend. It's a huge store.< /Text>

Excellent art supply inventory, lots of fun craft products, affordable decor...if you don't mind your home taking on a staged, realtor photo look. Seriously, lots of themed elements.</text>< Pics>

< review>
Two cashiers open...what a shame to make your patrons wait in long lines, especially when the person in back of me told me she asked the manager if they could open another register and I told her I had asked too...they never opened any other registers and there were at least 8 guest in front of m.j e and another 6 to 7 in back
Not good customer service< /review>

Great store, great people, great sales I could spend all day in this store and get in to trouble spending too much money! They have everything here from home decorating to crafting to professional painting, schetching materials, model building, fabrics, really all kinds of neat stuff I got a few canvases and paint brushes while I was there pretty competitive prices. Give them a try remember they are not open on Sundays!</Review>

< Review>
Good products lots of choices but they need cashiers the so bloody slow and are always under staffed. The shelves appear to have products but there is not much selection with these items. I wish they had PCB and soldering stuff. That's a hobby if you ask me. Nice selection of Rit products.</Review>

What isn't there to say about this place. This place is HUGE! They have so much to offer. No matter what craft your into, I'm sure they have what you need. I feel this is a Michael's and a Joann's all in one.  Holiday decorations galore! For every holiday especially Christmas. Also their pricing is great. They always offer a 40% coupon on their mobile app, but they always have stuff on sale, or marked down. Staff is helpful and friendly. Anytime I ask for help, they drop what they are doing and walk you to what your looking for, rather than pointing and telling you and aisle number.<//review>

<Review>It was my first time in a hobby lobby and I was impressed at the wide selection of goods. There is something there for everyone. My wife dragged me in there as she wanted some frames to hang up our recent vacation pictures. I roamed around and found sports team signs, muscle car collectibles, diecast models, and much more. I more than happy to accompany my wife when she is ready to go back.< /Review>< GmapID>

Totally love this store if you are a fan of vintage and rustic household goods. Also great variety of artificial flowers and leaves 50% off. Arts and crafts like paint, ribbons and jewelry components. It is a higher end version of Joann.</review>

<Text>I Love going to Hobby Lobby! They have some of the best stuff for Do It Yourself and lots of Decorations! There is also a 40% coupon online for most stuff that is not on sale (most stuff has some kind of discount from retail prices). The employees are very helpful.  I just wish that there was one closer to where we lived and that the would open on Sunday.< /Text>< time>

Do NOT go to a Hobby Lobby without an emotional support partner. You will buy stuff you'll never use and then get stuck returning them.< /review>

As if I was going to steel something. I  am a person who always pay.But to be followed around than when I left the store two of the managers were standing by the door giving me a stare .I just stared back at them.I WILL NEVER SHOP HERE AGAIN  HOBBY LOBBY AT THE EASTLAND  IN COVINA........🤬😠😡🤬😠😡👎👎👎👎👎👎👎<//text>

I can spend hours in this store. So many things to see, ideas, etc. The discounts are good and if anything isnt on sale, you can always use the 40% coupon online. Awesome!<//Review>

This place is super big its very similar to Michaels but this place has a lot more wall decor I mean a lot you will get lost **joke** but it is a little pricey and then they slap on like half off. It's a good place for decor but u know I can find them cheaper somewhere else.< /Text>

<text>I like hobbies, here is where I run to for some supplies and tools. It's a great store for your DIY projects, the staffs are helpful,there's everything here. I get lost in this store because I  get  so many ideas bouncing in my head and so much to see, I like to go down every isle I don't want to miss anything, and it allows me to become more firmular with the store, on days when in a hurry I  don't want to go down every isle, looking for what I need, I just want to go to the isle retrieve what I need and head home to continue or begin my project.</text>< user_name>

Anything you need to develop any craft project will be found at this store.
They sell a lot of decoration items and furniture.
It is a huge store. They have an app where you can get coupons and a list of the weekly promotions.
Restrooms are clean.< /Review>

This is a neat store for those looking to do crafts. They are very well stocked in many items not found in the likes of the bigger store chains. Store is very similar to Michael's with a slight Christian under tone.<//text>

The store directors were over the top helpful with my issue. Their selection of craft supplies and small projects is bountiful. I would definitely recommend Hobby Lobby to my friends  Especially the store at Eastland Center  in W Covina.</Review>

I love Hobby Lobby and everything it stands for.  I received great customer service. The store was nice the staff was great.  Wish there was one closer to my house.  I also respect the fact that they are closed on sunday. A time for employees to spend time with their families and honor God if you desire. AWESOME PLACE.< /review>

<Rate>3<//Rate><Review>Only one of two shops within my driving distance that carries a decent variety of colors for Miyuki Delica seed beads (The other shop is closer but they only carry 8 colors), I will admit it's great for emergency color/supply grabs. However, the price is definitely higher than prices I see online for the same amount, about a $2 to $3 difference. Not exactly wanting to shell out too much for these pretty beads for my project (Was up +$40 for one very small project), but like I said earlier, it's good for on-the-spot needs. Just wish they carried a bit more color varieties, especially for the reds, oranges, yellows, greens, and grays. There are plenty of violets/purples and blues though.

Oh, and more finishes too. I find a few too many aurora borealis (AB) types and lacking in other finishes, in particular matte and ceylon.

They never seem to carry the galvanized gold beads... It doesn't even have to be the 24k plated one. Just the normal gold beads. They have silver galvanized but never gold galvanized.

One more thing, maybe Hobby Lobby can pass this on to their Beaded Treasures division, but can you PLEASE put the bead color code on the labels? It helps especially when I have to buy more beads of a particular color and I've been noticing some of the newer labels are lacking this crucial bit of information.

Other than that, it's a nice place to stop by whenever I'm heading home from school and need quick materials.< /Review>< UserId.>

<review>Good place for hobby material, but I could not find anything for plastic model kits, such as model paint, plastic model kits, etc. They had a lot of other assortments, such as framing, painting, paper crafts, etc. For a hobby store, I would expect to see what I was looking for here.< /review><name>Henry Kim< /name>< Time>

<time>1546133046391</time><text>Bad cutomer service, generally speaking. Returned some beads that originally cost me $4, not including tax, unfortunately lost original receipt, manager said she could not even give me full store credit for the item only 50% of what I paid. Since I don't need the beads I had no choice but to adhere to their lousy policy while they will put the item back on the shelve and sell it again for the full price. This terrible care for the customer and stealing. They need to look at other retailers such as Walmart, you can return just about anything and you'll get your money back or full store credit, no questions asked.<//text>< rate>

If you're not arts and crafts this is the place to go. To be honest they are a little pricey but if you take your time and go through the internet you can find coupons and deals that makes it worthwhile to go here especially if it's something you must do as a craft for the kid or yourself and they don't carry it at your local stores they will have it here</review>

<review>They have all kinds of stuff you need for many projects.  3 stars is deducted only for their staff rude and unprofessional staff. This is the experience  I had with 3 of them and I did not bother to ask the fourth one. The management needs to train them on customer  service and how to smile!<//review>< pictures>

Amazing big box selection of crafts and sewing supplies. Sale prices are good but list prices are not inexpensive. Staff are helpful but sometimes not easy to find at very busy times. In same shopping center, they are very close to Walmart and Target so some better prices on standard stationery and supplies are available a walk away from same parking lot. Free parking is convenient. Use smartphone or go online to their website and printout coupon before shopping. They feature a 40% off one regular priced item (with some exceptions) most times. They are closed Sundays so Saturdays are extra-busy.</text>

<review>I wished you sold brown wrapping postage paper.  I went in and asked and was told to go to the back of the store but no one assisted me, after having surgery walking that far seemed like a mile.  Anyways, I didnt find any brown postage paper and no one helped so I left disappointed.< /review>< pics>

I love Hobby Lobby, they have such a variety of items. I do think that the staff should reach out to the customer more, they see you looking for something and if you don't go to them they don't help. Just a little can I help you go's a long ways.</text>

The first time I came here I was left with a bad taste in my mouth, today I decided to give them another chance and I was highly disappointed. The cashier was beyond rude. I grabbed a couple of items and was under the impression that they were 50%. When I went to pay the cashier rudely let me know that they were not. I told her that where the items were there were various signs that stated "50% off" she then proceeded to speak to me as if I was illiterate saying that if I would have read I would have seen that it was a specific brand that was on sale. I understand that it was an honest mistake on my behalf but she had no right to speak to me as if I was stupid. What made matters worse is that the line of 2 customers I waited in took over 10 minutes, the manager kept having conversations with the cashier which delayed the entire process. Coming from working in customer service the customer comes first and any unnecessary side talk should be left for break time. Although the selection is wide at hobby lobby I will stick to michaels where the cashiers are always friendly.<//review>

This place has more furniture for sale than actual crafts. Not big on Halloween decorations, but for Christmas, this is the jam.<//Review>

One one the workers was rude to me.  It was the manager.  She acts like she owns the place.  Does not treat the customer with respect.  I tried on a pair of sunglasses to show my son and she told me that I could not be walking around with the sunglasses on.  How rude.  Will never shop here again.</review>

<text>The person who mentioned it was like Wal-Mart is telling the truth unfortunately I cut my finger on broken glass only to be ignored as I bleed everywhere while" employees" just where just standing around talking to each other like nothing. They waited a while to get me one bandaid but sent to most skittish guy to "assist" me. He had no idea of what to do he looked freaked out so of course I left without making a purchase. This happened a few months ago i've yet to go back, probably never will. Really really unprofessional idiots.< /text><name>Loopy Rod< /name></record>

This place is just like Wal-Mart!!!!!!
They DON'T CARE care about their EMPLOYEES!!!
Plus, they Do Not Open on Sundays!!!
The single (and last) time, I walked in, I was not able to get help from an associate because they were all in the front (apparently they were all "Cashiers" and that's what they couldn't help me on the floor) telling each other stories and laughing.
I will NEVER EVER WALK IN OR SHOP IN HOBBY LOBBY!!!!!<//Review>

Supposedly the store closes at 8:00pm but they start herding you towards the exit at like 7:45pm. I know they close at 8:00pm and I know the workers want to go home as soon as possible, but that is not good customer service.<//text>
