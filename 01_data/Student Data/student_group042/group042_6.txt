Alex was very polite and had the best customer service that I have encountered in a while. He had the best prices I think that none can compete and had all the parts I needed for my S-class. I'd recommend these guys to anyone in need of parts for there car. You will walk out very satisfied and I am forsure coming back here for all my parts. Thanks Alex and team.< /review>

<review>I needed a part for my car and I couldn’t find it anywhere around before i came here. Alex and Hector are the best! They helped me with everything i need: getting a part, finding someone to put it on, finding someone for another part they didn’t have and even recommended a good place to eat :)</review>< GmapID>

<review>This place is absolutely fantastic. I live in Michigan and purchased a transmission online. There was a minor hiccup on my end with the transaction, but Mercedes International was very understanding and patient with me while I reorganized some information. They held the part for me until everything was good to go. Another thing: EXCELLENT COMMUNICATION!! They ALWAYS got back to me the same day, or early the day after, if I reached them after hours. They made the process painless...thanks so much to the team at Mercedes International! Highly recommend...</review>< Pictures>

Good group of guys. They not only had Mercedes-Benz parts but a large selection of well-organized Chevy Ford and just about anything else you could find. I would definitely go there again for any of my auto parts needs.</text>

<Review>First time at this store. What a great crew. I bought a simple car mirror and was treated like I made a major purchase. Juan, Alex and Jose were great to deal with and  I was amazed at their knowledge of obscure Mercedes parts. It's nice to know that good service can be found along with good people at Mercedes International. Thank you.</Review><Rate>5</Rate><userid>114256820667010445879</userid>< Name>

UPDATE! Alex really helped me out bought some parts for my ml320, all parts works but not in my car so i called back & Alex went above and beyond his duty to help a stranger out. What a cool guy & he gave me a engine cover for $25 it goes for $275 online, so I went back to exchange all of the parts and Alex did it for free now i don't think that is fair to him because the ML320 Mercedes is now running thanks to him he gave me the parts from his wife's ML320. My car has not been working for 2 months now just for $500 instead of $2,500 which is what Mercedes would have charged i got my car running Thanks this is why i live small shops because you can speak to the owner.<//Text>

<text>Terrible company. Paid for overnight shipping and they shipped it ground.  As I needed it overnight to do a job, I ordered another part and had it couriered same day from another part supplier.  Asked if I shipped it back could we get a full refund.  They would not refund our money due to their mistake. Can not stress enough DO NOT BUY PARTS FROM THIS COMPANY!<//text>< gmap_id>

Owner Juan, and his main man Alex, are without a doubt professional Mercedes- Benz," gear heads"! They know what's going on not with just parts, but with years of Benz knowledge! Owning the best car in the world is not cheap, but the guys at Mercedes International help take the sting out! So stop by and talk to,"my guys", and make them," your guys", judge for yourself! Gods blessings and best wishes, Semper Fidelis!</Review>

<text>MI employee Chris was very pleasant to work with as I asked him numerous questions after finding my part then asking for two emails full of pictures and then reading over all of MI's policies since I was having it shipped to PA. I probably was annoying with everything but it was a thorough process and the door has arrived just as I saw it in pictures. Great customer service!

Thank you Alex for your great help with my CLK parts !

I called MI before I went on the 250 mile drive to Rancho Cordova. I got a clear description of the parts on the phone. When I arrived to pick up the parts everything was as described. Alex was very friendly and help full, also the guy's who took me out in the yard to inspect the parts before purchase.

I am a German and mechanic for 35+ years. This shop is clean and well organized. The yard is nice and clean as well, the pulled parts are stored with care.

This is for sure the place to shop for Mercedes parts !<//review>

I drove 30 minutes to pickup the part they said it's in there in inventory, when I got there  nobody in the office remember talking to me and of course they didn't have the part.< /review>

<Review>I needed an engine for a 2011 G55amg and these guys had one in stock off a 05 E55, buying the engine was as simple as buying anything else online, I am from NY and they did not hesitate to ship it cross country. They sent me bunch of pictures prior to shipping it out and I received the assembly within a week. The assembly was professionally packaged with extra care. After transfering some of my components engine went in without issues and started right up, havent given me any problems since! I really liked the simple and professional experience and highly recommend this place for anyone needing parts for their Benz!< /Review><pics>None< /pics>< Resp>

Communication of staff is unprofessional. I was seated then asked to pay at the cash registered... then i was told that they would come to the table to take my order. Confusing... food is pretty good but the quality of food over the years have depleted...<//Text>

<review>This is a great little place right off 16th and Potrero in the Safeway parking lot... The food is always fresh and the service is good. We arrived around 9pm, we were seated quickly and our food was on the table before we could drink the hot tea. The Chicken Teriyaki is so flavorful and the salad with extra dressing, is a must have if you like sweet dressings. My friend ordered the salmon dinner and said her meal was perfect. Thanks again... I didn't give it a 5star because the entrance to the resturant is sketchy... you go down a few stairs, through a hallway to finally arrive at the Resturant. FYI this place is wheelchair accessible,  however, we saw two homeless people having coitus in the wheelchair lift .... just pay attention to your surrounding, but do not let my incident scare you away because I have been to this place several time... and will be back.<//review>< pics>

No complaints... just as its namesakes, "I Luv Teriiyaki & Sushi" and is just the meal I ordered: Teriyaki Box w/Sushi. It was very good as I was hoping it to be since it was suggested to go to with my daughter by her bff who we met there. Wait & service quick.< /Review>

<Text>I love the very relaxed and simplistic approach to sushi at this local neighborhood sushi joint. I love the fact that I can get a good and decent bento box consistently, and not extremely overpriced. Their fish is fresh, and their atmosphere is relaxed and calm. I definitely stop by this area whenever I am in the neighborhood, as their sushi makes you come back for more!</Text>< Pictures>

<review>Waitress was rude and we had to ask for water and extra napkins. Food wasn't that great,and items weren't in the food as presented in pictures. This place used to be extremely excellent few years ago,but not so great now. I won't be going back!!< /review>< GmapID>

As an infrequent regular, I can say that this place has solid, consistent, GREAT FOOD. The variety is numerous, from sashimi to rolls, grilled teriyaki to Udon, the vibe is laid back, and the cost is reasonable. Just don't complain when they get busy, which happens on occasion and during peak hours, lunch in particular. I've never had poor service though, ever, and I've going here for 8 years.<//Text>

Great food, but they close for lunch 3:00 to 4:30. Really annoying for a restaurant that serves lunch.< /Text>

Excellent food and service. Delivery is on time and food is great! This is not your typical Chinese fast food--this is Mandarin cuisine for pick up or delivery (no dining in yet). Blown away by the flavors and the friendly service! Highly recommend this place and especially the wonton soup!</Text>

I place an order over the phone of wings with pork fried rice. When arrival to pick the order, the wings were spicy. I explained I wanted just regular wings. The gentleman at the cash registered got angry bf agitated that it was not his fault for the error, and ask me “who will pay for the regular non spicy wings is not my fault” I express that I do not need the spicy wings just wanted the ones ordered. With anger the gentleman employee was very disrespectful and furiously ordered the wings and continuously saying who will pay for the wings. The embarrassment in front of other customers, the lack of understanding, the lack of customer service, the disrespect to my persona, I believe the employee should not be in business. They just lost a frequent customer. I hope this serves as an example for other customers in the future. This behavior is not acceptable. Bless the business.<//Review>

<rate>5< /rate><review>The only place that had the food all three of us wanted. So we took a chance and ordered delivery on the 27th, after lots of restaurants had been blown out for the holiday. They took our order and delivered it on time, for a good price and, the food was marvelous. Well prepared, great ingredients, seasoned well. It was an all around victory. Aside from some confusion setting up the delivery, it was a 100% great experience. We will definitely order there again. Thanks China Bros!<//review>< pictures>

Terrible. Paid for Delivery. Said it was gonna be 45 minutes. 2 hours later - I went in and they hadn't even started the order yet. Said I was gonna wait another 20 minutes. being reliable and prompt is important. Nobody has 3 hours to wait for dinner. Get your system and processes down better.< /Text>

Food was fine, but they just don't have the staff to keep up for demand. Waited for nearly 2 hours for food. I called in and was told it would be done in 30min, showed up and waited for over an hour in store. As I waited, everyone's order was so late to the point many people just left. Staff kept saying 10min,  but that really meant an hour. Experience was so bad will probably never eat here again. I suggest you only go here if you don't mind waiting 2 hours for food.</text>

I was met with a rude "eat in or out" question. No hello, etc. But who cares... Is the food good? Yes! Fresh and tasty. I had the chashew chicken. They were all speaking in Chinese or Korean. I reminded them this is America... Speak Spanish!!</Review>

Great prices for great food. Fast service and friendly staff. Lost of food and different appetizers with our family dinner for 4. My husband was skeptical because he is never been but I went there with my mom before and we loved it. He said it was a nice surprise how everything was so great. I'd definitely recommend it to a friend. I want to go back and try other dishes soon.< /text>

At the time of this review there is a national quarantine going on along with meat shortage. Yet these guys are still serving amazing food and giving you a great amount for your money. Thank you so much! You guys are MVPs!</review>

NO FOOD IS EVER READY & sitting under warmers‼️ because- Everything is freshly cooked and prepared and hot when ready!
This is New York style Chinese food.
FAST CHEAP GOOD
it’s everything you want and expect from a great little Chinese place- plus they offer cheap delivery service close by...PLEASE SUPPORT THIS WONDERFUL ESTABLISHMENT
-it’s not a quiet place to sit and eat all thought they have tables and booths - It’s very loud and most people come in and sit and wait for their food to be ready or they call ahead< /Text>

<review>I would give this place 0 star for customer service. You have the right people cooking your food because they are good but the manager is just plain rude. No customer service at all. Face and mannerism suggest you are wasting his time. Not going back anymore. I love supporting small businesses in Escondido but would rather drive  somewhere else for Chinese food.< /review>< pictures>

Delicious food with great portions. Always super fresh and made to order. Amazing lunch values and portions and quality that are a great value at any meal. This has become my go-to for Chinese since opening. Be it call in and take out, dine in, or ordering online through their site, or delivery, I've yet to have anything but a wonderful experience with this place. I keep coming back and trying something different from the menu almost every time I come here, and have yet to not enjoy my meal.<//Review>

8/2/20 Sunday, At around Nine my Aunt and Grandmother went to China Bros and they had to wait an hour and when they got home the food was all nasty the orange chicken was all hard and old and the fried rice and sauce were all old too and the Barbecue Pork tasted old and rotten. That night they got sick after that, the next day they were very sick, vomiting with stomachaches. Also, they weren't wearing gloves when they were making the food, and the customer service was horrible, they didn't smile and they were all mad. We are never going back to that restaurant if I could give it 0 stars I would.</Text>

The server was rude and needs to learn how to do customer service. The food was blah and the beef with super chewy. I really don't understand why people put people who are rude to serve their customers. As if we're doing them a favor when they're supposed to make our experience Good and comfortable so we return to their establishment.</review>

The food is usually good, HOWEVER this particular experience I had the guy on the phone was rude, and raised his voice at me in a mean tone when I couldn't understand him due to how fast he was talking and all the background noise. Which this is a problem everytime I call. and after him repeating back my order which was so fast he had to do twice I got there to pick up my order and it was WRONG . this is not the first time they have messed up a phone order. Just the entire experience was less than stellar and they need to work on their phone manners and slowing down to make sure I didnt just pay 30 bucks for food that is wron g. And during all of this I couldn't even get my order fixed due to their high call volume and being unable to go directly into the restuarant which I understand during this time.< /Review>

<review>Grew up on guam where authentic chinese food is served. Even in households. It stands up for quality. The service is always welcoming. Love all the items on the menu. I should know my mother is hawaiian chinese Philippine. Asian dishes fill my house.< /review>< Pictures>

<review>Tried this place for 1st.  Food is decent.  Had Mongolian beef,Sesame chicken, & Mu shu pork.  Share the plates with friends.  My friend order fried rice.  The waiter ask how many, he didnt tell us how big or size. I think he should of told us.  We assume it was in tiny bowls, so order for each.  The serving for one would have been enough for all of us.  Make sure you ask if you have any questions about the food.  It may not be the same as other places.  Will try for take out.<//review><pics>None</pics>< response>

Best Chinese in Esco hands down. Fast, convenient and classic. Hunan beef and sesame balls are stand outs but you really cant go wrong. All the American Chinese staples are here too.< /Review>

1st time being there. Felt like being rush to order.. Hard to understand the team member in front. Showed up at 555pm got our food. Close to 45mins later. While other couple showed up they got their food 1st. They were only there 15mins.. Our food was ready and it was just sitting on the counter. Got our food, but the wait was ridiculous.</text>

I tried this place because of a recommendation. I ordered here twice. First time, I ordered Mongolian Beef and Black Pepper Beef. I was extremely disappointed when I took a bite and the beef was CHEWY... 🤔 I don't like my bed thick and chewy. 😒 Second time I ordered I tried their chicken instead. I ordered Black pepper Chicken, and Lemon Chicken. Black pepper Chicken was bomb. Sauteed with bell peppers and onions and sauce over rice 😋 Lemon chicken was ok. It was breaded but didn't taste any lemon at all. This strips of breaded chicken. Wouldn't really recommend that one. Lots of choices to choose from. Fresh food, reasonably priced. Just stay away from mystery beef. Lol.</review>

They change their food EVERY TIME we go here! The wings used to be spicy and delicious but now they're plain. Portions are half what they used to be. Very disappointing and won't be going back anymore< /Review>

Delicious authentic Mexican food! Get the mole! You definitely won't regret it! The lunch deal is great! The chips and salsa are very good and they come by to fill them back up often. Definitely a great small place not to miss!<//Text>

Homemade, fresh, and family- owned delicious Mexican restaurant... The service was quick, friendly, and accommodating. The ambience felt very authentic.  Great for bigger parties with 8 or more. Also delightful for a couples, date-night lunch or dinner.  They have a kid's menu too! The parking is limited but be patient, a stall will open up! The owner is so warm, friendly, and wants "the best" cuisine for their customers and it reveals itself on the first bite.  I/we enjoyed it tremendously and are anxious to return weekly! God's blessing to you all!  Enjoy😍</Text>

Our first official dinner date at Lupita's and two years later, our waitress still remembers us!  Very personable with great service.  I compare all Mexican restaurants to this one in the Sacramento area.  No one has beat their great tasting authentic Mexican food yet!  Great salsa, beans and my favorite, cheese enchiladas and chili relleno.  Good prices too!</text>

<text>Their mole is divine... it's so delicious. One of the two best places to go in the Orangevale/Fair Oaks/ Citrus Heights/Folsom region that I know of, and I've lived in the region for 35 years continuously, for great Mexican food at a reasonable price.< /text>< Pics>

The food here is A++.   For the price I don't know why anyone would go anywhere else.  Make sure you bring cash, keeps the prices lower.  I can eat lunch there,  leave a tip and it only sets me back 10 bucks.  That is with me just drinking a cold  glass water.    They serve chips and salsa as well.   What makes this place shine about all the rest, what gives its luster is the service.  The friendliness of  staff is fantastic.  The positivity is recharging.  What are you waiting for?  Go now and experience this great food.<//text>

Food is great but the place is a bit dated. One of those random "we'll stop here" places that surprises. It's a local spot with awesome food (read Mole) that should suffice any appetite. Stop here for good food and friendly folk.< /text>

I LOVE THIS PLACE!  Me and John have been coming here for years and it is our go to place for Mexican food. They make the best tacos and the rice and beans are prepared exactly how I like them. Best of all, the taco shells are fresh and never from a box. Try Lupitas once and I’m sure you will come back. Thank you Maria!<//review>

Was honestly not too big a fan. I have a firm belief that all Mexican food is different and this style just wasn't for me. Extra star for the good service.<//Review>

I have been reading here for years. Im real picky when it comes to Carnitas! I like it extra crispy and they'll prepare it how you want. Great food. I've never been dissatisfied</Text>

I am extremely picky with Mexican restaurants since I come from a family who owned  very successful restaurant for many years.  a couple of weeks ago we found this place by accident. I was very impressed. It was favorfull. We cleaned up our plate which is something we never do. The chicken enchilada sauce was delicious and the rice was also delicious. I also had the chicken mole which was the most delicious I had ever tasted. Overall it was yummy and will be going back.< /text>

<userid>104952128741639039031<//userid><Review>Slow service.  Especially for Mexican...  Maybe it was bad timing?  The waitress said they only had one cook.  On a Saturday night?  Waited to order, then waited forever for food to arrive.

Very loud.  Don’t come here if you have trouble hearing.

Food is mediocre. Smaller portions than expected.  Rice and beans are bland.  No “salad” on my plate.  Really everything seems bland.

Margaritas are blah.  Wine I think.  Salsa bland, but fresh. Friendly staff.<//Review>< Pictures>

Very fresh for a reasonable price. This is coming from a dweller of Sacramento. I was expecting slightly chewy but nope. Not this place. Must be all their white customers giving good business.< /Text>

<Review>Good  food , adequate service, and  friendly dispositions make every eating experience pleasurable. The food is of a more standard Northern  Mexico  fare, but  Lupita will take special orders if you ask!
(for me that means flat  green meat enchiladas with a fried egg on top!  And sopapillas!!!)< /Review><name>Darvish Blathsnocker<//name>< gmap_id>

We have been coming to Lupitas for years and they cook the most authentic mexican food in Sacramento y ellos hablan español así que si buscas cocinar en familia this is your place. The prices are very inexpensive so a perfect place for a date night. I get the chicken enchilada and shredded beef taco with beans n rice. My wife gets the chicken enchilada with rice and my 12 year old daughter gets a plate of beans. Just writing about it makes me hungry lol and i was there yesterday. Gracias Lupe y familia for always doing such a great job!< /review>< Pictures>

<Text>I'm not picky when it comes to Mexican food.  We ordered takeout from here, steak and shrimp fajitas. The portions were small for a typical restaurant, the veggies were on the soggy side, the tortillas were stuck together and the chips were stale. I really wish it was a good review but I found the food lacking. Will give it a 2nd chance, though the first time I was very disappointed.< /Text></record>

<rating>5<//rating><text>Very comfortable, pleasant restaurant. Menu shows all of the expected Mexican dishes at  very reasonable prices. We had entrees of tacos, chile relleno and beef enchiladas, rice and whole beens. Very tasty, beautifully prepared with very fresh ingredients. We will be back to explore Lupita's offerings when we have more time. We enjoyed ourselves. We'll be back.</text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Resp>

Dirty tables, the guy who brought us drinks spilled an entire soda on my boyfriend, nobody even came out to apologize or even offer some free guacamole?? The waitress was very argumentative and rude to us...terrible service!!! We just left at that point. I've never left any food establishment after sitting down except for this place. I honestly don't know how they pass their health inspection. I would give zero stars if I could.< /text>

Been here twice, food has been great both times. Good asada street tacos, good jamaica and horchata. Seems like a small family operation and they're always nice. If they're consistently good my next few visits, it'd would be 5 star worthy.< /review>

This place has real authentic Mexican food that is to die for its the best of the best. I grew up in Los Angeles so this is a huge compliment because there is Mexican food on every corner the canita's plate is amazing and so is everything else on the menu grandma Lupitas treats and loves my family as if there an extension of her own family my kids call her grandma and they love her and look forward to seeing her and eating here.. I highly recommend to everyone very nice not to formal down to earth hospitality. Please do yourself a favor and treat yourself to Lupitas.</review>

Only been once and had three crunchy tacos with chicken, pork, asada.  I'm not a big chicken taco guy but whoa, it was my fave of the three! I'm an asada guy and all were great!  Nice family run business, very friendly.  I hope to get back soon.  I went on Cinco de Mayo 2016.</review>

I won't go back.  I ordered carnitas takeout. Perhaps it was a bad day, but they were inedible -- much too greasy and salty to have any real flavor.  I ended up throwing it away, and I NEVER throw food away.</review>

Lupita has brought her grandmother's recipes with her from Mexico.  It is a comfortable, relaxing restaurant and most of the time Lupe is there to greet and visit her guests.< /Review>

Lupitas is my favorite mexican restaurant hands down! The food is amazing and homemade. Chips and salsa as soon as you sit down and a very friendly atmosphere. I have been going to Lupitas for over 15 years and I have never had a bad experiance. I go here at least twice a month, as I board my horses right down the street. If you like Chicken Enchilatas, you won't find better in the area.
I tell everyone I know about this place and I get the same response......Great Mexican Food!!! I love Lupitas!</Review>

But about 1/2 the price!
But the thrill of a sit down mexican restaurant is the chips and salsa. And they are great!
A little hard on the eye's and need to remind them for something you asked for...
But thats what you would get in your mom's kitchen... and it feels like family...
Taking a date there tonight for the thrill of a hole in the wall meeting...< /Review>< pictures>

I went there based on the reviews. Food was average, but I didn't like that they microwaved my food including the Styrofoam container! I don't care that you are giving me microwaved food, but if you are microwaving, at least use something that is not harmful. Will not be going there again.< /review>

<Rate>1</Rate><review>Horrible customer service. The manager was rude when it came to returning a pair of primo khaki j75 brand dress shoes. He said , "oh I don't stock these brands anymore I literally just sent these ones back." I look to my left from the register and see the same exact pair of shoes sitting on display. Then the manager with the mustache says oh you gotta return it to fashion valley. The receipt clearly says "we will gladly refund or exchange any unworn merchandise with receipt"
Then the manager with the mustache replied with a rude and condescending tone " uhmmm YA NO, Im not returning it here go back to fashion valley"
Very rude and unprofessional. I work in a very similar industry where customer service is key for business success. This manager needs more customer service training. I'm never going to shop to Journeys here in Las America Outlet Mall or Journeys in general.<//review>< pics>

Absolutely happy I did!!!
I ordered the combo plate with half beef and half chicken and add avocado. It is definitely much better and higher quality than the typical generic teriyaki chicken franchise spots (flame broiler waba grill)
The quality and freshness of the meal is on point! Even for a take out, it's still tastes amazing at home.
It's a bit more on the pricier side but you absolutely get what you pay for.
When I arrived I saw a big sign outside that said "buy two bowl get one free", only on the weekends! I love me a good deal, so I'll be taking myself up on that offer , see you soon Wagyu Meat & Grill, you've got yourself a regular :)<//Text>< Pics>

<review>I'd stopped into the shop a few days ago to grab a menu--I'd seen it on line, but one place said they didn't do take out, so I wanted to make sure. They do.

Yesterday, my husband went in to pick up lunch: kalbi ribs and wagyu beef plates with rice, kale salad, and a cabbage slaw with thin-sliced avocado on top.

Every bite was amazing! Tender, flavorful meats with delicious sauces, fresh and crispy salads with vibrant dressings--that are perfect accompaniments to the meat.

The plates were presented beautifully and weren't dripping sauce or grease (I hate sloppy to-go containers). It was very clear these guys care about the food and how they present it to customers!

It's a lovely little shop with friendly and informative staff, and it would be pleasant to dine in, when we can.

I highly recommend ordering from this gem!<//review><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMAUK9s6ilEBFJU6AEMeGQu3GccwqtZkciTRcJy=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipMcpPGmXzNUdkdE1fFHcd-4Ue75uKf59MEGtep7=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]</pics><Resp>None</Resp><Gmap_id>0x80dd2bea4865669b:0xf68dd64dbfe9db69<//Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<Text>They have great frozen, premarinated, high quality meats that you can buy for a reasonable price and enjoy it at home with family or for a dinner party. They also have delicious Bento boxes. Not too many options, but I like how they keep it simple. Cashier guy was also very kind and generous.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

This place is so good I had to come try all of their different variations.
Wagyu beef and Pork are my favorite. You can get them combined.
I go with the combined plate with fried egg and avocado.

Mouthwatering!!< /review>

<text>I travel and eat out all the time all over the country and I have to say that this place is over the top, I honestly think the best food, quality, taste, value, service of anywhere I've been. I think about it for a week before I know I'm coming, dream about it when I'm away. The salmon is out of this world, Loco moco fantastic, rice perfect macaroni salad to die for and all at a fair price from really nice people. Every single time the salmon is cooked perfectly, everything is consistently  absolutely perfect everytime. I'm thinking about buying a house in the area just because this place exists 🤔 😅 😏 love it. I hope you people that live close by know how lucky you are!</text>< response>

<Gmap_id>0x80dd2bea4865669b:0xf68dd64dbfe9db69</Gmap_id><Review>Can't beat the quality/price ratio of their beef bowl. Service is and friendly and quite fast considering they're cooking everything to order.  Grilled jalapeno in the condiment area is perfect if you like some heat with your meal.  Not a huge amount of seating and it can run out if you're coming during rush hours, so be ready for that.< /Review><user_id>101147344047432788729<//user_id><rating>5</rating><pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipPcckT1jp0qG99RhH6iJVg8O-VUXJO038aKmnFq=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]< /pics><user_name>Steve Yocum</user_name>< Time>

Do not go to Yoshinoya or Flame Broiler for your beef plates/bowls. Go here. Straight up beef that is fantastic, and the exact amount of sauce you want. Great kale salad too. I didn't feel a need to try the chicken. Seating is minimal, so get in early or eat standing up. Plated like a meal prepper masterclass.< /Text>

Buena Park, Calif (Orange County)

One of the best spots for chicken bowl type of eatings.

Service: Pleasant.

Food: OMG the chicken and wagyu beef is surreal.
Chicken: Typical fire grilled teriyaki. Bit salty for me and goes well with the house teri sauce & hot sauce.
Beef: Drool. Quality, softness and flavor is on point. Best beef bowl in America.
Mac Salad: For a $1 or $2 depending on size is worth it. I typically grab double mac. Whoever makes this for them deserves a cookie, pat in the back and a high five. It's commercialized/processed, but, not too obvious.
Rice: Korean style. Sticky. Preferred rice.
Salad: Sucks... Cause who raves about a damn salad?

Location: SE Plaza on Orangethorpe/Beach. Heavy congestion especially around Halloween. Adjacent to Fuddruckers.

Decor/Interior: Small. Limited seating.

Cost: $10ish. Appx $16 for legit fatties.

My favorite lunch spot =)
Happy eatings.

<Text>This is almost hole in the wall.  I have been there numerous times and yes it is tiny place and both ladies are great and over all food is good or great.  Seasoning is not really strong so it is better for me.  Salad and brown rice is there for health conscientious person.  Really enjoy their moco-- what is there not to like.  Maybe they can give kale salad as option to pasta salad.  Just other day I ordered 19 plates to go for church meeting and they all loved it and wanted to know where I 've got it from and wanted to know if they do catering which they do.  Their salmon is great too.  I hope they stick around for a while.< /Text>< GmapID>

I had the chicken without sauce. The chicken was still flavorful. I tasted the Kurobuto Pork.  If I was not on a keto diet, I would order the Kurobuta Pork.  The Kurobuta Pork was very flavorful with a spicy kick. It was delicious!</review>

The beef bowls here use wagyu beef bulgogi which makes the beef much more flavorful than other bowl places. The butcher shop is still here and you can still order A5 wagyu beef by the pound.<//Review>< Pictures>

Nice, affordable place to have a cold one and watch some sports (why I came in) and enjoy Lemoore, CA.< /Text><rate>5</rate>< Resp>

<review>Attended the Walnut Christmas dinner dance. The staff was fun, friendly, and entertaining with their skits. The band, Chico, played a lot of danceable music, and we got fed to boot.

I went to vote.  Much money spent on senior center.  It's a shame we were cramped into a small room to do our civic duty and privilege.  That was quit a  eye opener for city funds to be used for the convenience of a few and not all citizens when we need it.< /Text>

A group of friends attended Walnuts annual Mother's Day Lunch. It was well planned and catered event, from the decorations to the games and prizes. I would recommend it. Also loved the food and not having to cook and clean up. Very satisfying. M.A. Phillips< /Text>

<rating>1</rating><review>I come to this location on a regular basis, they usually have Don at the register and he is a great employee, very curtious, super sweet and very helpful. I came tonight with my girlfriend and another friend.  The "owner"? Was at the register. I used the atm, kissed my girlfriend and was immediately told that if I wasn't going to buy something I had to leave. I asked if I had offended him (we are a lesbian couple) as I was being slightly affectionate (a lip peck, not a make out session or anything like that)   and why I was being treated this way. I obviously just used the atm and was walking towards the back of the store to buy juice. I have never been treated so poorly. I've been coming to this location for months, spending money making large alcohol, and snack purchases on the weekends and I've never had a problem.  I asked if he was the owner and he said yes to which I replied that I would never be coming back. He was a horrible person and his treatment of his customers is appealing< /review><user_name>Zarah Carter</user_name><resp>None</resp><Pics>None</Pics></record>

It's a regular liquor store but if you go here to get your Western Union they're still using that ancient machine< /text>

<Review>I celebrated my nomination yesterday in this delicious restaurant. I am glad to say that we passed a wonderful evening and the restaurant was indeed one of the reasons for this outstanding celebration. The crew  participated in a gorgeous way, the food was great and my friends were extremely  delighted. We shall surely visit again for more events. Thank you very much.< /Review><Pics>None< /Pics><Resp>None< /Resp>< gmapID>

Very nice owners.  I find they try to keep most prices competitive.  They run some good specials regularly.  The meat counter is very nice and well kept.  The produce is not a high quality.  That is the only reason for my 3 star rating. They have improved the equipment in the store and improving overall which is very nice.  Riverdale is very lucky to have them. Wish they could/would improve produce.  During these uncertain times I have always found what I needed here.  Good job.  Thank you.  Appreciate having a nice market in my small town.<//Review>

Super chill spot with great prices and even tastier food.
The portions are super filling and the wraps are exquisite.
Minimalist vibe and wonderful service!</review>

<Text>They had cheese cloth and a secret entry to a tunnel that goes south for miles almost unlimited! A Jesus cult called the Children of Christ Kult Shanghai trap door near the fake restroom and I woke in a cell adjacent to the tunnel heading north to south I know this because I hear the faint talking echo and murmured in the half cement and wooden area I was captive. I was taken to a underground facility that uses pig poo to fuel the community called barter town with the ruler Master Blaster! After the riots and prisoners escape I made my way back to find it's 33 years in the future! I swear it was mid 80s and now I can't find my firebird t top and disco biscuits!!

<Text>This Taco Bell location is pretty consistent with their quality and service. I went through the drive-thru and they were pretty quick. They gave plenty of sauce packets and napkins, unlike some other locations. The parking lot is a bit tight, but this location isn't that hard to find. It usually gets busy during lunch and dinner hours. My favorite items are the spicy potato soft tacos and the crunchwrap supreme!</Text>< pics>

Came here about 12:30 pm. Hands down the best service I have ever received, EVER! Crazy thing is I've been going to this taco bell for about 8 years but never this early. The guys working the windows were absolutely on point even with a complicated order. Fast, friendly and courteous and when I say FAST I MEAN IT! I must have ordered 8 tacos a couple of chalupas some burritos and a CUSTOM crunch wrap supreme, I paid and before I got to the window the guy already had the order on the tray, absolutely awesome! BERNIE IF YOURE OUT THERE, DO YOUR THING!! If there was a tip jar I would have left my credit card, just WOW!< /Review>

Great place for fast food. I enjoy ordering through their new app in advance, although just double check for custom orders, since its a busy place.< /Review>

<text>I liked this place and gave three stars because staff was very nice not rude but this place im not gonna lie could  this place could use a tidy up its seems a bit gloomy and dirty I like how they only take 2 minutes but a very much shady location to risky if you are alone. I would come back because of the fast service and nice staff. Its not to crowded either in the inside .</text>< Rating>

Dollar items are worth it but don't try to go inside. The doors are locked and only the drive thru is open.< /review>

Slow, slow, slow. Placed an order using the kiosk because the cashier was taking his sweet time. Took over 20 minutes to get my food. I've never been to a Taco Bell with such awful service. Never again. 😠< /text>

Food was good, was ready very fast. My order was correct and I was given proper change with my  receipt.  I will no longer use their drive thru ever again. There are a lot of pan handlers that will approach several times as you are trying to order. Also as you already got your food and trying to pull away, they will approach you there as well. I understand that homelessness is a big problem,  but I'm sure the management at Taco Bell can work harder in what's going in their drive thru.</Text>

This was the most fastest Taco bell I ever been to. Feels like fast food again.  It was a point where I didn't feel like I had to wait forever for French fries.  So happy from the service.< /review>

Unfortunately the chips there are stale almost every time I go there. The other stuff is pretty good but if you like nachos from taco Bell like I do this is not the one to go to for that sadly.< /Text>

Before you go off on a tangent, I know Taco Bell is not your typical Mexican Food fast food. For what it's worth, if I don't want to indulge in a greasy burrito or saucy enchiladas, I settle for TB. It's fast, it's tasty, and does not make me run to the restroom. That's 5 stars in my book.<//Text>

My go-to taco bell since it's never busy, that means the employees aren't rushed and take time to perfect those chalupas and crunchwraps as they should be. 👍🏻< /Text>

Bought two grilled stuffed burritos.
My grilled stuffed burrito was smashed flat. It was also missing beans, horrible to get a burrito with no beans. The second was seemed to be fine, although it was not for me. I walked two blocks for my food.<//Review>

Their service is always fast and friendly. Usually only wait 3-5 minutes tops for an order and that's a huge difference to the McDonald's across the street that almost always takes over 10 minutes small orders. Lots of parking if you want to eat inside too.< /Text>

<text>Taco Bell is still one of my favorite fast food spots because they have the consistent staples and are constantly coming up with delicious new options.

Also, if you are hungry the $5 boxes are a great deal and include a drink. These are way better than any "value meal" you can find elsewhere.

Bring back the chili cheese burrito!<//text><Date>1519579773677<//Date><rate>5< /rate><response>None</response><Pics>None< /Pics><Gmap_id>0x80d94df3fc7bd78b:0x556141f34e2b64ea< /Gmap_id><username>D Kroeger</username>< user_id>

I didn't stay at the restaurant, just ordered *to go* at about 5pm, but it wasn't very clean (the floor and table where I sat to wait for my order). Still, the staff was kind and the tacos good. The minute maid pink lemonade tasted watered down... Overall worth it for take out.</Review>

They never seem to get the correct order. Got home to missing item and they put sauce on a burrito when i asked without sauce. Then i call them and it's just a busy tone.< /Review>

Well, the food was fine. As you'd expect from taco bell. But when i walk in, i had to wait until somone who's cooking comes and takes your order, making me stand there for about 5 minutes<//Review>

Whoever is working the graveyard shift on this day Sep 25, around 130 AM, should be fired!! There's no reason why my food should be looking like this. You have no care in the world to just slap together just sauce and cheese on a tortilla knowing that's not the correct order. Where's the ground beef? Where's the TLC when making food? I hope your manager sees this!! Y'all are making Taco Bell look bad smh.< /text>

This Taco Bell location is a joke. It is the second time here, and they messed up my order on both occasions. The food was smooshed and the hard she'll tacos were all broken. They dont have any good customer service nor good communication skills. In bilingual and i still did not understand the person behind the counter. The worst part about this trip here, is that the guy making my food just threw the box to the counter, almost falling if I wouldnt have caught it it would have fallen on the floor. Worst Taco Bell ever @tacobell</review>

< Review>
Horrible customer service from 1 specific worker . Name is patricia . Always making a face when asking for upon something. On top of that they messed up my food. I understand it happens and i was ok with it didnt want to argue or anything just wanted my food done right. ( am vegeterian) i asked for a chessy rice and bean burrito , got it with beef and went back to ask for another one, patricia kept arguing with me that it does not have beef when theirs CLEARLY beef grease and the meat when she opened it . Also asked for 2 beefy frito burrito no beef sub beans and add potato . Did not add potato. After that she told me to watch her make them, when making them all she did was technically be like "look BEANS , look RICE ,  no beef , look POTATOES" which iritated me cause almost felt as she was taunting me . Every time i come here in the morning always get same service from her. Highly dissatisfied. Switching to DEL TACO forsure !<//Review>

<Text>Order two shredded chicken quesadillas... When i get home... No chicken.. So i call and GEMA or Hema answered..  Or How ever you spell her name.  Didn't seem to be bothered by a complaint. Did not try to even to assist to a simple order fix.. Waited over 15 mins to get my order so im not sure how they messed up a simple order... She should not be answering phone calls is she is not going to be helping customers. If she is a Manager... She just showed to me what type of people they have working for taco bell.. And if she represents the face of the company... I am no longer going to be a customer. Something as small as asking.. What is your name.. Let me write it down and when you come by again mention your name and receive your order correctly next time.. Simple..< /Text><Pics>None<//Pics>< Response>

< Review>
I give  5 stars for the guy working drive through named Ivan, it was a moment of de'ja vu when he took our order at window 1 and then gave us our food at window 2, when this happens I assume its because someone else dropped the ball.

The manager; however, is a scum-bag he gets no stars. As I said before, Ivan was jumping between two freaking windows and that fat slob manager was yelling at him and bumping his fat gut into him, he should be fired immediately for harassment, and sexual harassment. You don't yell at an employee who is doing an excellent job..you take over god damn window 2 and help that kid out...you could learn a thing or two from him, he looks 18 and has the discipline of a Soldier...and yes, I have led Soldiers into combat...I know discipline when I see it. I'm finished with this...i'll remove this review if that piece of crap leader is removed from his job.

Good job Ivan I hope you get recognized, your customer service is impeccable, and I will tell you to check this review out next time im there. If I see you running from window to window again im coming inside and talking to fatso.<//Review>

(Translated by Google) Cheap. Rich. Good service of the employees.
At the time I was homeless came, or so they seemed, and among them who wanted to take all the "free" things (ice, napkins ...) and the employees watching over them; it was uncomfortable.

(Original)
Barato. Rico. Buen servicio de los empleados.
En el rato en el que estuve llegaron unos homeless, o eso aparentaban, y entre ellos que querian tomar en exceso todas las cosas "gratis" (hielos, servilletas...) y los empleados vigilandolos; fue incomodo.<//Review>

<Review>(Translated by Google) I am Mexican and I like Taco Bell, his American versions of our food are a good joke, it will never be the same but I think that really is not that his goal, but to present an alternative version that does not taste bad. The place? It seems appropriate and although they almost always do not have that product you tried last month, there is always something new.

(Original)
Soy mexicano y me gusta Taco Bell, sus versiones americanas de nuestra comida son un buen chiste, jamás será lo mismo pero creo que realmente no es esa su meta, sino presentarnos una versión alternativa que no sabe mal.
