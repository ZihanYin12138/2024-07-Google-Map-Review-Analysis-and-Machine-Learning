Great Store! The customer service is amazing and they tend to your needs for what type of sleeper you are and what style bed is best for you. Juan H. and Kathy were amazing sales reps and helped me in every aspect of purchasing a new matress. I walked away with a dream bed and an amazing deal. Thank you guys a bunch for upgrading my sleep!</Review>

With progressive leasing it's no credit checks with a 90-day payoff option and they also have financing if that's the route you choose. Fast clean and friendly!< /Review>< Pics>

<Rate>5< /Rate><review>Yesterday, my girlfriend and I left our house with no intention of buying a new mattress or even looking at them.  Though we had talked about it a few times in the recent past, we were not in a hurry to make any such purchase.  But, after leaving the Yuba City Walmart, we noticed very interesting signs. The signs described great deals at Mattress Firm.  Because we were not in any hurry to go back home, we walked to Mattress Firm to learn more.  When we were arrived we were greeted five fairy friendly associate, Jaun.  Right from the beginning, it was a no pressure environment. He just explained how the process works when shopping for mattresses and what features to keep in mind.  He then provided us with advice on which beds to test.  Though several felt fantastic, my girlfriend and I settled on the Midnight Intellibed.  We notified Juan that we were interested to learn more about the bed and we sat down with him to discuss it’s cost. Thankfully, he informed us that there was a California king-sized bed available.  It apparently was returned due to buyers remorse and that we can purchase it for nearly half price.  Though we were slightly uneasy about buying a (supposedly) slightly-used bed, we were comforted by the fact that we were told that we can refuse shipment if we see anything wrong with it when it is delivered to our house.  We were doubtful that there would be any structure issues with such a object and we read about California laws which require mattresses to be sanitized before for any resale.  For these reasons, we decided to go ahead and make the purchase. It only took a few minutes for Juan and his awesome associate (I forgot his name) to put in the paperwork.  Now, we have only days to wait for our new bed to arrive and sweet dreams to look forward to.< /review>< pictures>

Delivery did take a week because the box spring wasn't in stock and the delivery service was fine, nothing to write home about.

<text>I spent all day looking for a mattress for my mum. I couldn’t find any deals until I came across Mattress Firm in Yuba City. Not only did I get a great deal I got free delivery.
The service by Ivy was so good. She listened to what I could afford and what in was looking for.

Walked into this store for the first time with my friend only looking for a mattress topper for his parents, left the store with a mattress topper for myself and my friend along with his parents and a job offer when available. The people that work here are the nicest and most relatable people I’ve ever met and I genuinely enjoyed talking with them<//review>

We had a wonderful time choosing Our New PURPLE mattress. ☺ John Sosnowski did a great job helping us decide what type of bed is comfortable for us.

Highly recommend John's help if you have any questions about your sleeping needs and/or are looking for a mattress upgrade.

Overall , a Great experience and investment!

Btw the Purple feels incredible, we have both slept more deeply and our cat Flapjack loves it too. 😼

Big Thanks!< /Review>

Ivy was our sales person and she was fantastic!  She answered all of my questions and she went above and beyond to get us the most for our money!
I will go to her again when I need a mattress for my guest room<//text>

Call ahead to be sure what I was looking for was in stock so I didn't travel into town for nothing. "Yes we have it" I was told. Get there and the same person i spoke to tells me "I'm sorry I made a mistake, but I have this other mattress thats twice as much." Don't recommend this store to anyone!!!</review>

{'time': 1616607903862, 'text': 'Hello Charles, We apologize for the miss communication. Unfortunately we have over 70 stores that pull from the same inventory throughout Northern California with inventory sometimes changing by the min. You were most likely offered something that we had in stock to help you out due to the inventory change. We do have a starting point of $199 for a queen matt and typically able to delivery next day. On top of that we offer a 120 day price guarantee and 120 comfort guarantee. Again we apologize for the inventory miss communication and hope you have a GREAT day!'}</response>

We are highly pleased with John's customer care😊 I say care because that is how we feel he treated us. With his help we decided on the perfect mattress for us, in a reasonable value to comfort level. Then John made our lives even brighter by discounting as much as he was able.  We took 24 hours to think about it and even checked out a few other places. Mone matched with the experience we had in Johns's store. We returned and made the purchase with him. The bed is slated to arrive soon and we are looking forward to it!<//review>< gmap_id>

<Review>Rebekah S. did an awesome job of helping us find just what we were looking for! She stayed in our price range, got us the best possible deal, answered all of our questions honestly and was just really genuine! Our bed hasn’t been delivered yet, but after spending the time with Rebekah, I am highly confident we will be satisfied when it does! I would highly recommend this Mattress Firm!!

We were so grateful for the service by Kelli Siller at this location.  We were completely prepared for the “hard sell”.  However, she simply provided information and when asked, she provided additional details about mattresses we were considering.  We never felt like we were dealing with a commissioned sales person!  During the checkout process she was very informative about any fees or charges, and always looked for our agreement before assuming.  While we were there, an employee named Rebecca (?) assisted periodically and was equally friendly and helpful.
I was very impressed with this location and especially the lack of “fast talking - pushy salesperson” techniques of the staff!

Call and ask for Kelli! She may be located in another store, but it’s worth the effort to deal with such a genuine person for such a huge purchase!
Thank you Kelli! We really appreciated your gold-star service!< /text>

<Review>Went in today to get a mattress with my grandmother and boyfriend. Our experience with Johnny was amazing! He was very professional and super knowledgeable about the products. He was friendly and NOT pushy to make a sale. We found the perfect mattress thanks to him. The store is nice and clean and I loved the selections. Johnny helped us get the best deal and I will be returning to this store to make future purchases. Thank you Johnny for all your help!<//Review>< Pictures>

The staff was very helpful and patient. I took my friend John in to choose a new mattress. John is developmentally delayed. But the staff took us through the process of finding just the right mattress for him even though making choices are difficult. He was very happy with his selection. John and Felix were wonderful. I would recommend this location.< /review>

This store and employees are amazing! I went in clueless about what to even look for to finally sleep comfortably, and scared of what I was going to spend. Rebekah took amazing care of me, she suggested what beds she thought would benefit me and patiently stuck with me while figuring it out, perfectly explaining their finance options but not being pushy. When I found the right bed for myself, she made sure I had everything I needed, (mattress protector for my crazy kids, pillows, etc). She also set it up so I had my bed within that week! When we ran into an issue, she called and fixed it quickly. I LOVE my new bed and my experience there, I’ve recommended even my family!< /review>

We made an impulse purchase online for a sleep number bed and instantly regretted it - ran into Mattress Firm and had John help us find the perfect bed and adjustable base.

My wife and I were greeted by Rebekah Stohlman. She helped us get the bed and comfort we need. She is a very professional person yet someone who can joke and laugh with you. I would recommend her and the store to everyone. Thank you for everything you did for us Rebekah Stohlman.</text>

<Rate>4< /Rate><Text>I went in to comparison shop because I needed a mattress for my guest room.  From beginning to delivery, every person I encountered was top notch.  Rebecca my sales person bent over backwards to help me save money and I didn't have to go anywhere else.  Then when the mattress was delivered by Steven who was training Sain, from the moment he opened the door of his truck and gave me a great big hello to the moment he left, went above and beyond to help me get everything perfect.  He should be the Ambassador of training.  A great experience with this company.</Text>< pictures>

Purchased a new mattress Monday from John, he was very thorough and allowed us to take our time to find the right mattress.

It was delivered Wednesday, the process lasted maybe 15 minutes, taking the old mattress and box spring out and bringing in the new ones.< /review>

We're glad everything went smoothly from start-to-finish from when you were in-store with John, to delivery with our Delivery Team. We're glad the process was quick, easy, and relatively painless. Enjoy your new purchase and sleep well! See you next time in-store or online. --Megan"}< /Resp>< gmap_id>

<text>This is the worst mattress I have ever owned ! Very uncomfortable ,I am extremely disappointed . I waited too long past 120 day trial   Because they said it takes a long time to break in.     Now I am making payments on a $5399.00 bed that we hate sleeping on !  We are absolutely miserable having to sleep on this overpriced , uncomfortable mattress. I would not recommend this place!< /text>< resp>

This is one of my favorite donut places, but the prices have gotten excessive. $27.99 for a dozen"fancy" donuts! They are good, but the response to this review is inaccurate. Lying about the prices doesn't make it better.<//Review>

Great service and really fresh donuts any time of the day. Busy enough they have trays of fresh donuts coming out every few hours and amazing texture and clean taste (no starchy preservative taste you get with grocery store or chain donut shops)< /Text>

<text>These guys make the best donuts in town. The donuts melt in your mouth and just from the smell from the fresh donuts in the morning make my mouth water. Very friendly staffs here and they get you in and out fast, even with a long line, which is great when you need to get to work. Andy’s Donuts also is one of the cleanest donuts I been to and they have lots of table if you want to sit down.< /text><Response>None<//Response>< date>

<Text>I go here quite frequently, and have never had a bad experience… Only four stars simply because  they were out of the donuts I wanted on two occasions.

That’s how good they are!

<Time>1566792415142< /Time><rate>1< /rate><Review>Been going to Andy's for years back when Andy own it.
Since the new owners the customer service has decline fast.
My last visit
I personally delt with Danit who I thought was the owner with his wife.
I felt me and my kids were a burden to him.
So rude and didn't care much if we were there or not.
I ask if he could warm my croissant a little more. And it seemed to bother him.
I ask if I could get it cut a few ways and that to seem to be a bother to him.
When I asked if I could get a few glasses for our milk and he flat out ignore me.
Rudeness like this will not be ignored .
I may be one customer but know many people in our community and work with a very large company.
Hopefully word of mouth and some bad reviews will change his bad attitude .< /Review><Pics>None<//Pics><Resp>None<//Resp><gmapID>0x808438f5b1269c1f:0xaaff2dc8ab88a2a4<//gmapID></record>

<Review>I was going to Andy’s donuts and bagels nearly every day for weeks to pick up something for my boyfriend. He liked the donuts, and I like supporting family businesses. But one day the owner gave me a dirty look when I asked that he put the chocolate donut in a separate bag from the jalapeño cheese bagel. I let it slide since it’s 5am and everyone has bad mornings. But it happened again when I got myself a coffee and double cupped it. I asked if there was a problem and he said “it costs me extra.” So I put the cup back and didn’t return for a few days. I came back and again got a look for asking for pastries to be separated and I mentioned that he had been rude to me and that’s why I hadn’t been in the last few days, and continued that I come in daily and never take napkins, don’t put cream or sugar in my coffee. He told me “I have to pay for the cups.” I replied that losing a customer seemed more expensive than one cup. He laughed at me and repeated. “The company doesn’t give me the cups for free.”
So, if you don’t care about customer service, I do recommend it. And everyone except for the father is friendly. I regret that I can no longer be a patron.

*update*
I posted this review over four months ago and just received this private message from the owner.

"Wow! I'm so sorry that you were so upset that you literally find our yelp page and wrote an essay about it. Sounds kinda pathetic. Our family each work around 12 hrs a day to keep this place running for the public, so we're sorry for being human and having some moody days. I'm so glad we won't be seeing you again. Have a nice life. "<//Review><Pictures>None<//Pictures></record></dataset><record>

<text>Donuts are delicious, definitely go there for the donuts.  The coffee is horrendous.  If someone knows the owners, strongly encourage them to buy better coffee, people will pay more for better coffee.  Staff were friendly.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics><Response>None<//Response>< gmap_id>

<text>I'd say it's almost divy, but some of the best places are!  I ordered a cappucino and it was made from one of those quick stop hot chocolate machines.  Not impressed with that.  The doughnuts themselves were good but not a lot of variety.  Good prices.  I'd go back to get some to go.<//text><Time>1535564848332<//Time><Gmap_id>0x808438f5b1269c1f:0xaaff2dc8ab88a2a4<//Gmap_id><resp>None< /resp></record>

Very unfriendly, no hello, goodbye, thank you.  Regret not walking out with the donuts squished in a bag rather then a box.  Expensive and late in the day was horrible.  If they are going to be so old looking, half price at least.  Never would I waste my time or money.</review>

<Review>I have been to this location a few times. Every time I'm always provided a good deal, realistic time frames and exceptional/honest work. I took my car in for 4 new tires and brakes (because I was told I needed them). The manager Mr. Pandy called me and told me that I did not need brakes and would do the tires. The tires were a great price and my car rides like new.. I asked for my old tires back and they had no problem giving them to me and even put each one in a special tire bag. I was pleased with the amount of time it took and the overall customer service. I am a returning customer because of their service, integrity and great deals!!< /Review>< userid>

Julian and Chuck were very helpful and informative.  Seemed to save me a few bucks and the team got my new tires, shocks and alignment done in a reasonable time.  Thanks again guys! See you next time.<//Text>

Took my Mini Cooper in with a flat on Sunday afternoon. The place was full of patrons waiting, but a mechanic still took the time to greet me and answer my question about what the wait time might be.
Jairo was awesome!  He was tending to another client, but stopped to ask what I needed.  I had to leave my car, understandably,  since there were 10 cars ahead of me.  Fortunately, they had my "special" tires in stock and my car was ready by Monday morning. Great service and good prices.< /Text>

<Date>1525182147433<//Date><Rate>2<//Rate><Text>I went early on a Saturday and they had some cars there already. They fixed my flat but the low rating is because it took almost 2hrs!!! I already had my spare on so i just left the flat there with them. Now I understand it takes time when there are some cars in front of you (my first job was changing tires). But 2hrs!! For the amount of cars in front of me it would take less time for one guy to do all four tires on each car!....and that wasn't the case! ( It was like 2 tires on two cars and like 3 flat repairs). The kicker was when I was paying the $25 before they fixed my flat, someone called and asked for an alignment. They told them only 1hr wait!!! WTH Is that!?! So I take it they work on your car depending on what they are doing and not the order you come in...and that's complete BS.
Oh and no...it really took two hrs to fix that flat tire, I came back around 1:50 later and they were just getting to it..and gess what a car was on the alignment machine... total BS!
Pic is of what I took out of my tire and when I put the spare on.</Text>< pics>

Turns out I needed all 4 tires replaced as well as a brake replacement. I was shown how bad my tires were and how thin my brakes were. Thankful that I came in and had everything taken care of. Lesson learned for sure!. Thank you Discount Tires and Chuck for your friendliness and excellent customer service!<//review>< Name>

I was assisted by Technician Chuck Pandy on a brake change at the Long Beach location.  He gave me expert advice on when a tire change would also be necessary.  I got four brakes changed for a decent price, and will likely return for new tires in the future.  Service was great !<//Text>

They were extremely helpful and accommodating. We found out the wrong tire size had gotten recorded for my paperwork so they didn't have the correct size on location. They were willing to send someone out to the warehouse to get the correct size AND get everything put on in the two hours before the closed so I could have my car back in time for an appointment. I'm SO grateful.<//Text>

<Text>I had a very pleasant experience going there. The manager bent over backwards to accommodate me and made sure i got every discount available. The people working there were very nice and they didn’t pressure me into getting any unnecessary things done to my vehicle. I told them what i could afford and they made it work in my budget. Will def be returning< /Text>< Pictures>

First time there and definitely will be back. Nice to have honest mechanics with great customer service. They are safe during this pandemic and don’t try to upswell you. Jairo was a pleasure. Even when they are busy they acknowledge everyone. 5 stars for these guys.< /review>

They charged me $297 in labor for new brakes and break fluid change the total I paid was $452 for just breaks front and back with no rotors. I will never go back their again I got robbed for my hard earned money and I have kids to feed and take of. No doubt I know they put the cheapest breaks on the market on my car to. The car dealership don’t charge $300 in labor for breaks front and back and take 4 hours to finish I dropped of my car at 9am picked it up at 1pm for just breaks no rotors either< /Text>

<review>I take my car here often but it seems they don't understand the concept of how valuable time is. I made an appointment for this visit. They said 45-60 minutes for an oil change and tire rotation. I returned 40mins and my car was still in the same spot. Could it be they were finished early? Not so much. There's no point in making an appointment. The work was done 40mins later. They were all very and courteous.</review>< Response>

I had a good  experience customer service was good everything except for the wait . I did make a appointment at 3:30PM for a oil change and two new tires  but they were really busy and didn’t get to my car until 5:30PM I just think when they set appointments they need to get a better understanding of how long things will take so customers are not waiting for no reason . Also if a appointment is taking longer then expected call the next customer in line before they arrive so the will know because everyone’s time is valuable.  For a walk in yes the wait would of been understandable but for a appointment that is not Acceptable .<//review>

< review>
I was offered a discount, because I came in for a simple rotation, and they offered some other ‘needed’ services that was going to cost way more than I could afford. I didn’t get the discount. Two weeks later, I’m at another discount tire place, apparently not the same company. This tire place informed me they can’t even get the valve open to put air into my tires. So that means this place didn’t feel the need to check the tires they were repairing. How do I know, because the last place, before the tire place, had the same issue with my tires. Thanks for screwing me over and not keeping me safe.< /review>

Took 3 hours to mount and balance 4 tires. I asked to keep my old tires, but they tore the sidewall when dismounting them, ruining my old tires. They also under-torqued all the lug bolts, overinflated the front tires, and under inflated the rear tires.< /text>

Came in for a tire leak about 1 month ago and 4 wheel alignment. The Mechanic said the nail in my tire was not an issue. I returned today with the same nail and leak. Really concerned about this organizations commitment to car safety, especially during COVID 19, where unethical behavior has become the American Norm..Will not return for any future services...< /review>

< review>
I've been coming here for about 16 years,  I've bought my last 3 sets of tires here.   I pull up the other day with my mother,  who needs just one tire for a 2005 Toyota Matrix.   I pull up and the guy takes some info,  we go inside and quotes me $120, which is VERY expensive,  but I trust this shop and I'm already distracted helping my elderly mother.   He tells me it'll be an hour and a half.   2 and a half hours later,  I call and am told another another hour.  I call back and another hour is needed,  someone to a long lunch.  ANOTHER hour until it's needed after that.   When I go in,  the final bill is $190, for a 15" tire for 15 year old car after being LIED to all day about how long it would take.   I'm never coming here again.<//review>

Cat was fantastic! She was inundated with call after call and walk-ins and was gracious and very sweet the entire time. She loves what she does and it shows in her work ethic. Ask if Cat’s there she will take care of you.< /text>

<review>WARNING: DON’T COME HERE IF YOU DO YOUR OWN OIL CHANGE. They tightened it so much that I couldn’t even go to another mechanic and was advised to go back to where I had my oil change because they can’t remove the oil drain plug as it’s too tight. So if you do your own oil change, you better not come here because they will do their best for you to come back here again. They will tightened the drain plug so much that other place or mechanic can’t even remove it. It’s ridiculous, I can’t even go to another place or do my own oil change because of what they did. Never again.< /review>< gmap_id>

After waiting for about one whole hour I realize that this location was still busy and that the manager was trying to cram in all the work that they can get before they close. I was told that I'd be waiting about 45 minutes. After waiting for about 1 hour 2 of the service attendance told me to move my car at different times I noticed that everyone else was getting help but me. It was a hot day day to be waiting outside. I could not have imagined waiting outside for one whole hour in the sun with no shade. This location is extremely unorganized and the manager is extremely unprofessional. The worker that told me to move my car was very rude and when I confronted him about it he got mad. This location is not a good location to get any type of services done on your car. They are out to get your money and to make you wait and do not take into consideration your time.< /review><pics>None</pics><Response>None<//Response>< GmapID>

I’m a returning customer and their customer service is friendly and attentive. Their work is thorough and professional, I’ll definitely go back when the time comes. My suggestion would be to take advantage of their “call when ready” service. Drop your car off, go home, come back when they call you.<//review>

Excellent service! I called when i got out work at 430 pm and saw one of my tires was flat. My commute is 40 miles so not driveable with a flat. They were able to get me in and repair the tire even though they were closing at 5. Fast and professional. Thank you!< /text>

My experience at the location in Long Beach was terrible. I’ll provide details and I have the paper trail.
I arrived at 4:45pm on a Saturday hoping the store would be open until 6pm for a quick change of spark plugs since A code indicating the #2 cyclometer was not firing. I was traveling and leaving the next day at noon. The store was closing and I was told by an employee to come back at 8am Sunday.

I came back at 7:45am the next day. The store was not open and there were no employees in sight. I waited 20 minutes and still no one. I finally saw a hand written sign on copy paper indicating the store would open at 9:00am. I came back 45 minutes later.

I asked the manager if he could do a tuneup right away and change six spark plugs. His response was that They had to diagnose and “see what else may need attention”. I knew the Jeep needed a tune up and with one cylinder kicking out a code-keep it simple and see if misfiring and code for away.

I said go ahead and take a look, but please get the spark plugs ordered now so there is no delay. 30 minutes passed before the car was pulled into a bay. Another 30 minutes passed and the manager flagged me over to tell me that the Jeep needed a tune up, a fuel injection servicing and magically it also needed a serpentine belt.   Has anyone ever seen the Dateline and 60 Minutes Type shows that expose the dirty little secrets of fraudulent repairs and false statements that mechanical shops give?

This was textbook Fraud.  the state of California should investigate and send in the cars that have been thoroughly inspected and where there is one clear problem that any experienced mechanic would find, report, repair and move on.

Apparently Discount Tire and this manager are still liking to instill fear and do “sell jobs” on the public—it’s disgusting.

Because I was 3 hours from home and trying to get on the road, I was presented an estimate that blew me away—nearly $500 for a tune up, fuel injection service and serpentine belt.

I asked the manager how long it would take to be completely done and to have me driving away. His response was “I can have the belt and plugs here in Under 10 minutes and the car will be ready 45 minutes to an hour. it’s easy work”...

I signed the inflated estimate because I needed to get going and did not want to risk a serpentine belt failing, even though I Never heard A frayed belt slapping the underneath of the hood and from what I saw, the belt did not look worn or failing, but the old fear factor the mechanics use takes over.

Fast forward 30 minutes. Still no parts. But guess what? There is an auto zone two blocks away. I offered to go buy the plugs and belt and be back in ten minutes or less and the manager said the parts would be there any minute. More lies.

Another 45 minutes passed and I approached the manager again, who said I was being impatient. It was now 11:15am. I was at their shop at 9am and not only were there no parts, it had been past the time the manager “promised to have you on the road in an hour.”  I reminded him of his exact words and he looked me in the eye and in front of other customers said “I never told you it would be done in an hour, I said it would be about 2 hours”.. more lies and now accusing me of having no clarity of the conversations.  I said forget it! Get my car out of the stall. I told the manager he was not only providing fraudulent claims of failing parts) but he is making time promises he knows cannot meet so that customers are stuck with a car in the rack.

I bought 6 plugs and serpentine belt at AutoZone under $60.00. I went to my daughters and with no  experience changed my first set of plugs at age 52. I was done in under 30 Minutes. The new belt was unnecessary and will be returned-as an ethical mechanic that was charging my AC system with Freon confirmed the belt was not work at all and he could read all the white lettering of Part numbers and Brand all over the belt.

I’ve driven 1,000 miles since this occurred. No problems, no codes, no failed belt. Discount Tires should conduct a fraud audit!<//Text>

Went to get tire under warranty  replaced and had to leave the tire so I wouldn't have to wait there I had my spare on so it was fine . When I came back they gave me the tire and didn't even ask if i wanted it on the car . I told them I needed it put on the car. They did put the tire on and the whole process took over an  hour to get to the point of them giving me the tire. It only took them 15 minutes to actually put it in. If you don't have a lot of time and are not patient don't go there they are a very busy place.<//Review>

I will highly recommend coming to this Discount tires for tires or any service that's needed on your car. The employees here are very nice and knowledgeable. Earnest helped me out with my tires and man I can't tell you how thankful I am for him. I went to a tire shop a day before I came to Discount and they quoted me a range where I was like man but I guess I need these tires. Then I checked Discount and I'm glad I did way less then the other guys and a good quality tire. Thank you Earnest and all the other employees at Discount tires on Anaheim in Long Beach 😊<//Text>

<text>Everything was good except.....I never received a call telling me my car was ready, and I had to go to work.

After 4 hours I called asking about my car. I called about 1:00 pm and was told about 45 more minutes and they'd call me when it was ready. 2:00 pm, still no call and I had to leave to work by 2:30 pm.

I walked up the street to the location and saw my car finished and parked, but no one ever called me. I had to hurry up and pay, and leave directly to work from there.

Other than never receiving a phone call about my car being ready, everything else was good.</text>< name>

I brought my car in in the morning for two new tires and was told it would take 2 hours. It took six. If I had been told that time from the beginning it would've been fine but because of that all of my plans were off. After hearing them say the same to other customers later in the day I feel like they were just saying whatever necessary to get the customer. I understand needing to run a business but deceiving or delaying the work on my car without notifying me is not acceptable. I've had plenty other shops tell me straight up the length and it has never took more than an extra hour than predicted.<//Review>

<Text>I made an appt for this place to get new tires and do an oil change. I spoke with someone from their sales/call center who was able to quote me $344 for the tires. When I got to the shop, the guy told me it would cost $422. When I told him about the price I was quoted he was able to find my reservation and honored the Price. I left the car at 9am and was told the car should be done in “a couple hours.” Took way too long and the guy I was working with over the phone said it was done and ready to pick up Around 1pm.

What's the point of making an appointment if you're still going to wait an hour and a half before they will get to your car.
A tire rotation and air shouldn't be 2 hours.
If you value your time, go somewhere else.<//text>

I thought it was buy two tires get two free as advertised. Not the case. Also thought you got 4 free lift tickets at Snow Valley for purchases over $299 AS ADVERTISED. NOT THE CASE. $700 total- no “discount”. The work was fast and my vehicle concerns were addressed adequately.</text>

After going to a local dealership and getting a price at discount tires that was quite literally half of what the dealer was going to charge for the exact same work I began coming to them and have been doing so ever since. The guys in the front office are all knowledgeable and friendly, and the mechanics all know their stuff. They have never overcharged me, and the work is done as quickly as they can do it while still maintaining the quality of their work. I brought in my Toyota Highlander to get its serpentine belt replaced. I had an appointment for 8 AM and by 10 o’clock I was already driving away for exactly the price they quoted me.< /Text>

This week has not been so kind to me. Going through 2 death in my family and having to travel an hour and a half everyday since July started has been hell. 2 tires blew in one week and my stepdad recommended discount tires and honestly I don’t regret it.

I called and spoke with mike Riggs on the phone and he was great. Gave a really good deal and even held the tires for me because it was literally the last set left.

I get there and Cathy fennell help me with all my paper and let me tell before I left you she admitted she was new but after speaking with her I felt like she worked their longer. She was so sweet and kind and I really appreciate her.

The whole staff was soo sweet. I’m definitely going to recommend my people :) the wait was about two hours but that place gets so busy, but honestly $450 for new tires and alignment on a bmw was sooo worth. Until next time.< /Text>

Terrible customer service , called to pre order tires for my 83 VW Vanagon, I am very aware they no longer make the tires that came with the car originally but the guy helping me on the phone told me there was nothing he could do , “ nothing “ total idiot ! I took my business else where . America tire depot in Long Beach took care of me in no time. I have been a Discount tire customer for years and will never go back.<//Review>

SUCH A RIP OFF. ALMOST 700.00 FOR TWO TIRES , TWO FREE, I CANT IMAGINE WHAT FOUR WOULD COST.

ANYWAYS I WENT TO A OTHER COMPANY. THEY SOLD ME FOUR TIRES AND DID MY BREAKS FOR AROUND 650.00.

<Text>I called to verify my tires that were ordered had arrived.   I was left on hold for 25min and I hung up.  So I drove in, and had an appointment and still over 2 hour wait.   They were supposed to call me when it was done, they did not.  I happen to just decide to walk back to the shop to find my car sitting.   Finally I just discovered they ordered the wrong size tires for my car.  Now I have two different size pairs on my car.    Details details.  How did they not catch that?<//Text><Rating>2<//Rating></record></dataset><record>

Pros
-fast service
-friendly front staff
-professional
-honest
-not too expensive
-great proximity
-first time I didn't feel like a place was trying to hustle me
-even their long time customers are friendly, thats rare!

Cons- I only have 2 the reason I didn't give 5 stars
-the guy working on my car didn't check my tire PSI and over inflated my tire ALOT and left the other  under inflated, so I had to do it
-I noticed that they said that I denied the alignment but no one ever asked if I wanted my tires realigned.</Review>< Pictures>

And they were packed with customers. Great service. Nice employees and no nasty up-selling me on stuff I didn’t need. Great job guys! Thanks again.< /Text><Rate>5<//Rate><userid>104201441714079812465</userid><resp>None< /resp></record></dataset><record>

The staff was friendly and prices were fantastic . I got a flat Saturday night so I needed to make sure I could get a new tire before work on Monday. Since many places aren't open on Sundays I think they were busier than normal (maybe it was their great prices too) so the wait was about 3 hours but I live close by and was able to get a nice little walk in there and back while still taking care of some things at home. Highly recommend discount tires in Long Beach.<//review>

<Text>Great service every time! I bought my tires there a few years ago. Since then, they have repaired two nail holes and didn't charge me a penny either time. This time I had my rear brakes fixed along with the struts and new shocks all the way around. They also replaced my cam sensors because of the dreaded "service engine soon" light. It was completed in  less than five hours. My car runs like brand new. Thanks, Discount Tire Centers.<//Text><pics>None<//pics><resp>None< /resp><gmap_id>0x80dd31a20797d9cb:0x7a0ae055614311e6< /gmap_id></record>

<text>Joe helped to get me setup and was clear about the wait times and cost. In my mind, a busy repair shop is a good one. These folks are honest, quick, and willing to work with people who have the right attitude. Jonathan, the service tech, worked a miracle and saved me from a more costly replacement. Thanks and keep up the great work!< /text>< pictures>

Came in, was told I had to wait since they were a bit busy. Had a seat in the lobby and was promptly ignored, three new customers were helped before me. Finally talked to someone about the screw in my tire. Then waited nearly 4 hours for a call back, called them myself and found out that my car was done long ago. Had to pay 25 dollars for a repair that is free at their counterpart, America's Tires. Not good service.</Text>

Not only are they incredibly slow throughout the entire tire changing process, but they are extremely misleading in regards to how quickly things will be ready. I special ordered a tire that they claimed would be in the next morning but in fact took 3 days after to come in. Then after waiting for an hour to be helped, I had to wait another 2 hours for one tire to be replaced. Save your money and do not come here. It’s supposed to be a “service center” not the DMV<//Text>

They won't deduct coupon from AAA that I forgot to bring in and did the next day . The guy there said sorry it too late.  Oh wow did he said that??!!   I'm going to call AAA tomorrow and report that station isn't cooperating with AAA promotional. Rated thumb down triple!</review>

<Text>Stay away from this place. They have horrible service. If I could give a rating of minus one I would. Thursday, May 16, 2019 I had the day off and decide to take my truck to get an oil change. It's before noon on a weekday and the front guy tells me that they only have one mechanic in that day (I counted five employees there). So they tell me I have to leave the truck there all day until 6:00 pm closing time for them to do an oil change. Whatever, I live close by so I walk home. At 4pm, I ask if the truck might be ready.  They told me it would be next in line. At 5:30 I get a message that they couldn't get to it and if I could leave it overnight. I called back furious. "It's a f***ing oil change!!!" I told them. For six hours my truck sat there without doing what could take about 15 minutes to do. When I came back to pick up my truck the guy at the front just stood there on the phone. Finally after 5 minutes I just blurted for him to give me my keys back. No apology or nothing. These people don't care. If they did they could have gotten any on of the five employees to do a simple oil change. There service is horrible. I wasted six hours waiting for nothing. You shouldn't waste a second here. For a little bit less Ron's lube n' tune on PCH and Coronado will have your oil changed in 10 minutes and you don't even need to leave your car. For tires go to Mountain View Tires or anywhere else.</Text><Pics>None</Pics><response>None< /response>< gmapID>

Best deal in town! I recently purchased all new tires, Breaks, Oil Change for my 2016 Honda Accord Sport. Not only did they price match other competitors pricing but they also gave me an additional discount. It only took a couple of hours to complete this and they did an excellent JOB! I will be going for all my car maintenance needs.<//Text>

<Review>This place used to have excellent service and awesome employees... Now they're all different workers, who are not very friendly. They completely ignored me... Told me they'd call me by 2:00 in the afternoon to let me know the status of my car... I finally called them back at 4:30pm to find out what was going on cuz no one has called me, the they told me they'd call me.back in about 30mins. They didn't instead they closed the shop and my car was.left there overnight. The next morning I find out that my car hasn't even been looked at yet. They charged me $1,300 to replace a battery and alternator!!!< /Review><userid>114293201286221753392</userid>< pictures>

They were on sale (Buy 2, Get 2 Free). When I looked up the tires, they seemed to be really good tires. As it turned out, the tires were quieter and smoother than the OEM Yokohamas that I had on my car. It seemed to grip well in the rain, too. We'll see if the performance is as good after more wear on them. I highly recommend this tire shop for good service!< /Text>< Time>

<Review>These guys did a really good job. I had a slow leak on 2 tires and brought it in. I bought 2 tires and got 2 free! 50,000 mile warranty, nitrogen filled, free tire rotations for the life of the tire for under $300. That's a steal. As well they did a 4 wheel alignment and oil change. I feel like the car is as good as new.< /Review></record>

I needed tires like yesterday called Costco wasn't open yet, Sears automotive didn't have my tires size needed to be ordered, Just Tires same didn't have my tire size needed to be ordered. Then I called Discount Tire & Service Center in Long Beach and Cesar Davila not only had my tire size but was able to install, mount/balance and do an alignment check which I did not need due to the great installation and excellent customer service at Discount Tire. Thank you Cesar and staff.< /Text>

Went in to get a tire patched. I was quoted 45 minutes, due to being third in line behind other customers. The quoted time was pretty accurate, give or take 5 minutes. But the real surprise was when I was told my patch and plug was done free of charge! They only hoped I would write a review describing my experience. They were very helpful, professional, and the job was done well in the quoted time. I would absolutely recommend these guys for quality and fair tire service.<//Review>

Wasn't sure what to expect, never having dealt with this company. I got a great deal on 4 new tires (Kumho) run-flat, high-speed V rated tires for my prius. The Long Beach guys were all very helpful and professional. Felt treated very fairly and could tell they were out to win my long-term business. I would recommend this place and certainly will return.<//review>

<Text>First impression wasn’t very good. Got there a a half hour early, they started opening procedure shortly after that.The guy in the garage didn’t speak as my sister and I walked past to stand in line at the door bc other customers started to arrive and we wanted to ensure or space inline bc I was late for work Bc of an unexpected flat. As we waited outside to exactly 730 the time they opened, neither gentlemen spoke or gave a greeting. When it finally did open  Jose was friendly to my surprise , he was very helpful. Then he held a conversation with the customers waiting behind me in Spanish as he is still helping me and they were laughing a little too hard and I couldn’t help but feel as if they were talking about me as he is still helping me. It was very rude and disrespectful. But despite that he helped me find the things I needed for my situation and had me back on the road within a hour which I super appreciate. I would’ve given a better score but as I didn’t feel very welcome there and the disrespectful conversation in a foreign language across the room as my transaction was still going on  I just can’t.</Text>< pics>

Jairo is the best mechanic there is and is very very knowledgeable on vehicles. He has been helping my family with our cars for many years and always is fair and honest with the prices he can offer for repairs/services. We will always be Discount Tire customers and will follow him whereever he goes.

Thank you Jairo!!< /text>

<review>Suppose to install 4 tires I had 1 broken wheel stud or lug. They called and said I had 3 broken and it would be $85. I said not to do it. Went n got truck   Checked lug nuts n they all came off no problem so I still only had 1 broken. Thieves. Thieves do not go here. Thieves  try to steal your money.</review>< Date>

<review>Staff was accommodating and friendly. Unhappy about Pricing. Called on the day that I want service for my vehicle to replace 4 tires and was quoted around $363 off the door, when I arrived at the location 15 minutes after the service advisor who mentioned that the in-hoise tires that was I ordered was on sale and it will only be for $328 total off the door. Thinking that I will pay for the one that was given to me up front, upon payment I still paid the $360+ amount.  Asked I thought that I thought the tires were on sale, service advisor mentioned that He cannot change the work order anymore because ot was already processed over the phone. Kindda not the way in building trust to customers.< /review></record></dataset><record>

Prices were just market rate, not discount by any stretch. On top of that labor dragged ass to an unbelievable degree. It took 90 minutes to change one tire - I feel like it would have saved time if I just rolled my tire in instead of letting these guys shuffle my car around.<//review>

<Text>Went there for a blinker replacement. They installed the wrong light, broke the socket that it goes into, and tried to fix it with duct tape. Only found out after I took it to a second auto shop to check on why the light was dimmer than my other blinker. I heard a lot of other customers complaining about their services while I was there, now I know why.< /Text>< pics>

Went to get the brakes fixed. Had to go back 4 times and still wasn't right. Cost me over $1100. They also took the paper work and receipt so we can't prove it. They don't know what they're doing and they have bad mechanics. Don't waste your time or money.</Review>

Took more than 30 min longer than the time expected. I also paid significantly more than I originally was quoted due to mistakes made by the people working there. When I asked if there was any way they could help with the cost the man at the counter pointed at the promotion i was receiving (buy 3 tires get 1 free) and said that was the best he could do. And btw look at the fine print on their coupons. It turned out buy 3 get 1 free was only up to 100 dollars. They have lost me as a customer even though I bought my last set of tires from them. I feel like I was bait and switched. Even though I probably wasn't due to fine print.</Text>

Was told it would take two hours to replace 1 tire but accepted because of price point. Walked to a few places to run other errands,  an hour later was called and told they actually didn't even have my tire in stock and would have to order it for tomorrow morning. Would tather pay extra and get professional service.< /text>

I don't recommend it  , l almost made a unnecessary expense because of there un professionalism  ... They tell you You need something done when you really don't need it . My experience was a couple of days ago I went in for an alignment and they couldn't do it because supposedly I need it to change a part in the rear that was to tight and they couldn't loosen it and that I needed to replace it , the part was gonna cost me $500 with labor, SO I left to another alignment shop and got it done the guy put some muscle into it and loosened it and was able to do the alignment .<//Review>

< Review>
Staff member, Jairo offered fast friendly service with a polite and helpful attitude.

UPDATE: I was asked to give a Yelp review prior to tire service in order to receive a $25 discount. So i did... based on the initial customer service. So, here is my follow-up review after the tire service. I was quoted $108 out the door for 1 Hankook tire. Not the case! I was charged $130.42. I'm guessing no discount? Needless to say I will not be going back.Try to be honest to your next customer buddy.< /Review>

Got quoted one price over the phone and another almost double when i got there. Was told because my tires were bigger it would be more to mount and balance, like the process is different for small tires or something, which there isn't. Overall dissatisfied with customer service and took twice as long as quoted, job quality was whatever it's hard to mess up putting tires on</Review>

Quick and fast service and the price was legit. Only thing I was not fond of was the fact that no one called when my car was finished, but that is really miniscule in comparison to the great service I and my car received.</Review>

<Text>Poor customer service - brought my car in 3 times for an iverheating issue was told it was fixed after spending $1700 on repairs😣 to later find out that they never fixed the problem just worked around it n put in parts that were useless!!! Now they wanba charge ne an extra $459.00 to install a fan that they should of installed in the beginning before hustling me for the $1700 wow what a ripoff stay away from this place!!!😠 Plus they screwed up on other parts and half did others wow I'm totally reporting them to the Better Business Bureau< /Text><user_id>105362363677721716860< /user_id>< pics>

Worst service ever. Took them almost 5 hours to change front brakes (which typically takes 45 minutes). They broke off my wheel locks and tried to blame it on me.< /text>

No one answers the phone. When asked by the machine to leave a message, after the beep it says "sorry this mail box is full"

I mean, if you had a business, wouldn't you make sure AT LEAST people could leave a message if you didn't have enough staff to cover calls all the time =/

Well, they lost my business.</Text>

<text>I came in with a tire that was losing air from a previous repair.  I dropped the car off and told the tech that I would be back around closing.  When I returned, he had the tire off the wheel and was able to show me what was going on.  He explained that if he tried to redo the repair that had become unreliable, he did not think it would work so my options were to buy a new tire (and he noted that this tire was both fairly new and discontinued by Firestone) or he would attempt to use a sealant on the inside of the tire, which is what I selected.  I went to the waiting room and settled in for a wait when he appeared about five minutes later and handed me my keys telling me I was all set and ready to go.  I asked for the bill and he said there wasn’t one!  I insisted that he had done work and needed to be paid but he refused to take my money and instead gave me a big smile.  Bottom line = HONEST, KNOWLEDGEABLE  AND FRIENDLY STAFF.  CLEAN WAITING ROOM WITH TV.  I WILL BE BACK!<//text>< Pics>

This office is great! I was able to get work done in a great amount of time and for a great price. The staff is amazing and so caring. They really made sure I fully understand what they are doing and how much it would be. From the front office to the doctor to the office manager all were amazing.</Review>

Dr. Ali & his team were great! I was very hesitant because of the neighborhood the office is in. But they were all very attentive and treated me like they wanted my business and appreciated my business. No one was inattentive at any time during my service. The visit was timely, I waited maybe  10 minutes before I was called back. The clinic was very clean & social distancing protocols were adhered to. Dr. Ali was so personable and explained I detail what he was doing & made sure I was comforted at all times. The hygienist, office staff delivered excellent service. Based on my first visit with them I would definitely recommend and think of this office as a hidden gem in the city of Angels<//Text>

Do not go here. Don not waist your time at this west coast dental. If I could give it zero stars I would. I don't want to get in to details but  I will say please check with your insurance in regards to what can be covered through them. PLEASE DO NOT PAY UPFRONT OR OPEN ANY LOANS OR CREIDT CARDS before get referrals sent to insurance company. Your insurance company will either approve or deny treatments and sometimes suggest alternative treatments that can be covered through insurance. If after all this you still have to pay out of pocket then work out a payment plan or look in to opening loans/ credit card. I felt coerced to pay upfront when in reality I had the option to submit referrals to my insurance company and wait for them to deny or approve request. so please don't waist your time here. they do not give the correct information to customers and they will not inform you that u can submit referrals to insurance company. I felt like I was fooled and robed by this company.  when I asked what are my options and what will my insurance cover,  I was told because he works with insurance company's so often he knows what is covered. so basically my treatments wouldn't be covered by my insurance company except the deep cleaning... when I reached home after being in this office close to 4 hours, I decide to  call my insurance company because It just didn't feel right that I  payed upfront WITHOUT having had any work done.  I got the codes from west coast dental so that my insurance company could check  my potential coverage of treatments. TO my shock  my insurance company told me that the majority of the treatments would most likely be covered. I was also informed that one of treatments that wasn't covered had an alternative that could potentially be covered. TO put the cherry on top,  I was told by insurance that the dental office had to submit referrals for approval of treatments. I was so shocked and all I could think was how many people have been scammed by this company.<//text>

honestly - they are just getting 3 stars because of the wait time in-between everything. i understand i was a new patient and had to get extra things done during my appt but i was there for 3.5 hrs when it could've been 1.5 - 2 hrs (which they had stated it usually is). Overall, front desk and hygienist were nice.<//text>

It is not a Dental office it is a Dental clinic. To many people in lobby. Looks like a hospital.
Was there over 2 and a half hours for routine check up. Then was told to wait  and someone would  come and explain my options.  After 15 minutes  I left.</Text>

<Time>1618003682721< /Time><Rate>1< /Rate><Review>I made an appointment for my 4-year old in preparation for her first day of school this fall. It was on yesterday at 1pm, and I made it clear to the caller it was her first time at the dentist. We checked in and the receptionist said there was a longer wait because some staff went to lunch. I figured they be back in 30 minutes since the waiting room was completely full. We ended up waiting for 2 hours! My 4-year old was bored and restless and wanted to go home. I kept telling her this needs to get done. At 3:10pm I approached another receptionist and told her how long we were waiting, and even asked if we should reschedule, she showed some empathy and checked where we were at in the list. She said she would be next. About 5 minutes later, my daughter's name was called. The dental assistant did not show any tactic to console or convince to try to sit on the seat so that her x-rays could be taken. So, she ended up not getting x-rays and we went to one of the examination rooms. My daughter was crying, scared, kicking and screaming. In comes the dentist and my daughter freaks out. After a couple of attempts to calm her down, the dentist then says maybe we should schedule her with a pediatric dentist. I immediately was upset. What do you mean? Are you not specialized in pediatrics? Why then are you in this exam room? She said it was protocol. General dentist take a look and then based on what they see would refer the patient to the pediatrics. She had no business even stepping in. I told the dentist I specifically told this office it was her first time and that she was 4-years old. I was so livid I got our things and stormed out. I wish they would pay more attention to the details, especially if it's a new patient and a kid. If you have children, my suggestion is to make sure you make an appointment with a pediatics dentist, regardless where you go.</Review>< pictures>

Had high hope for this place, but got catfished.
Over the phone the receptionist were very nice, personable, and professional but in person they had no patients, were over whelmed and were unprofessional. Everything seem passable up until the dental exam but when I was seen by the doctor it was so rushed didn’t bother looking at the rest of the mouth just said open wide and yup! This is what you need then walked away and was told to wait for their finance person for my options on my procedures, as I’m waiting there in pain I can hear the employees talking about taking shots, after their celebration shots the finance advisor walks in to tell me my option which are ridiculous in price and gives me a prescription which I’m allergic too after stating many times I’m allergic to that kind of antibiotic so I repeat myself again and he brings me a new prescription and my weird and regrettable experience comes to an end.<//text>

The visit was awesome sometimes and bad at times. The waiting time... sometimes i waited 2 hours. Some of the doctors were not careful handling patients they were careless and no care with talking to patients and interacting with them especially the young ones which they look they just graduated. I hope they do better.</Review>

Dentist and receptionists were nice but whoever is in charge of submitting insurance claims is just a MESS. I forgot her name but she’s a woman. She’s never in the office. She doesn’t even know what she’s doing. Even my own insurance called me twice telling me she was submitting the wrong codes. I gave up trying to talk to her and I just moved to another dentist office. My whole process going back and forth with her and the insurance was around 6 months and I got nothing done. I hope this review help you to save some time.

Update:
I just went to my new dentist today and I actually didn’t need any of the stuff they told me I needed at this place which was a $4000 bill approximately.
I only needed a deep cleaning and it was approved by my insurance on the SAME day.

I definitely do NOT recommend going to West Coast Dental. Save your time and money.<//Review>

<Rate>1<//Rate><Text>FRAUD ALERT!! My husband and I provided the dental company with my insurance information and we were both charged out of pocket fees. I was charged $755 and my husband was charged $400. I immediately called my insurance company and they told me I was only suppose to pay $260 for the inlay (which was never done because we we moved out of town two days later and couldn't come back). My husband was only suppose to pay $160 and he is still getting billed for work that was not finished. I have been trying to get my money back and have only been able to get $375 back.

Not a very good experience. First, I had my mouth worked on by someone clearly still in training and had trouble doing X-rays of my mouth. Second, the entire time I was in the chair I was harassed and inundated with upselling tactics to make me spend more money, with no regard to what I actually scheduled my appt. for: routine teeth cleaning. Third, the employee taking care of finance/insurance took my card for a co-pay while I was in the chair getting work done and never came back to return it to me. It wasn’t until after I had been checked out at the front desk and ASKED  for my card back that he actually returned it to me. Seven days later, my account was hacked and drained. Beware.</Text>

After my third visit I can confidently say I feel lucky to have found Doctor S. and West Coast Dental. Doctor is concise, attentive, and intuitive, he is also very kind. His right hand lady Delmi is an angel from heaven who made the process all a lot easier on me. (I have really intense anxiety about doctors hadn't been to the dentist in a long time so I must have been a handful) Even still every visit is great and I'm always happy to see Delmi again! They are very attentive to pain management, and my root canal was a work of art, perfectly executed. If you haven't been to the dentist in a while don't expect a short visit. The gentleman who broke down our financial plan and what my insurance covered is very friendly, he explained everything thoroughly, and he helped us pick out a good payment plan. Most of the other patients I've seen are very long term and it's for a clear reason.</text>

<Date>1616010809370< /Date><rating>1<//rating><review>I'm leaving a review which I rarely do. But giving you heads up what your are going to expect. Is your judgement and your choice. I'm not posting to down grade anyone. But I think Dr and dentist need to know is not just supermarket selling produce. Run their business correctly and see as patient not as money making materials. I had this felling in here. If you have medical Ins. they will not look at it at all. I had Delta dental HMO if you do gotta be careful they will take every advantage to empty your pocket.
They will not help at all the safe some money is the opposite. They will pick materials that the insurance won't cover.

There are pros and cons take really seriously.

I didn't like the fact treatments are my choice and shouldn't be pushed around.
If a patient wants to skip unnecessary procecedures should be granted and respected in my opinion. Not most of the case here.

Pros
They have in house loans and others.
The Dr skill is good extraction, crowns which I did.

Cons
You will end pay much more and have piles of loans and bills.
Unclear estimate always variable.
Overbooking when I go, it takes 4 hours
Dr hopping room to room.
Some prices are higher then other dentist
They always push you to choose expensive materials If you don't they refuse the treatment.

1 Expl of my procedures: They lure you with low cost adds but they always add some expensive proceedure before hand and the Dr. will say to you I can't proceed further, unless you don't do deep cleaning! I refused bc he said it's fine. So decided to skip bc is medically was fine.
The day of my appointment of my teeth whitening they changed again saying need deep cleaning  again. Otherwise won't do it (contrast of Interest). It was very unprofessional keep pushing land made me wait 1 hour) By the way it was $299
and deep cleaning with the insurance copay is $400???
Same day,  I went to DENTIST called Dental PRO, they told me in my case I don't need deep cleaning lol was mind blowing 🤯 and I did for only for $99. Can you believe this??? It was my first time with Deltal Pro.
$600 vs $99. THIS WHAT I have saved $500
This is just one example. Insurance HMO is just luring  mechanism for them. Be aware~ hope this help many of you. Also, hope this review will change West Coast Detal strategies please change your business mind set otherwise you will loose many patients. It is sad to see how some dentist's are turning now days.
Please be aware patient's aren't stupid. Now we have power of reviews and to speak out~< /review>< Pictures>

I was referred here By The receptionist Trinity R. Boy can I say they treated me well from the moment I entered the facility to the moment I exited. Was greeted with kindness , and joy. I really loved the environment from the following covid guidelines,  all the way to the just conversation. Loved how clean they were.

Dr. Shafa was really adequate with how my procedure would go , and treated me well. Along with his assistant delmy which was really nice , and new how to keep me calm.

Mark was the guy that did my temporary feelings ,and he did a great job. Also explained what , and how to go about what to eat , and what not to do.

I believe the person in charge of my paperwork,  was Keith. He made sure I understood all my charges,  and made me feel knowledgeable about such things , instead of keeping me in the dark about things.

Trinity was very professional , and made the room feel Live. I will forsure be returning for further services.

Everyone there seems like they know what they are doing to top it off.

Thank you very much West Coast Dental of 6th street. Keep Up the Great Work!! 👍🏽</review>

Really great dentistry. The place is very clean and parking very easy. They do a really good job. I am a returning patient who will come back. The staff is really caring.The only problem is the wait time. It can vary between 15 minutes to longer.  They really do individual care so sometimes your appointment time doesn't matter. They get to you when they get to you. However they are so good when they do that I wait for them.</review>

Over the weekend, I cracked my back tooth eating almonds. I came in as an emergency without an appointment first thing on Monday. I am so beyond thankful that I was paired with Dr. Monica. She took a quick peak at my mouth and immediately understood what was going. After a couple X-rays, she showed me that I had fractured my root completely. Even though I'm not well versed in dental terminology, she explained absolutely everything in the simplest terms and what my options were, but ultimately my molar could not be saved. I opted to have the tooth removed the same day. I would have usually taken a few days to think it over but I felt so comfortable and trusting in Dr. Monica's care. 15 minutes later, my tooth was on the doctor's bracket table with a bone graft placed. I am really looking forward to my post op visit next Monday with Dr. Monica. So far I am virtually painless, just a little tenderness. Next step, implant! Thank you Dr. Monica, you are truly an angel.</Text>

<Name>Vinnie< /Name><Text>This is the most unprofessional dentist office I’ve ever been to. They canceled my appointment made 2 weeks in advance to have me come in the day before to have a “procedure” done that would have me out of work all day and i sat in the lobby for 3 hours when they told me to come in ASAP ! With still no response from the doctor. And then i left Because this is a waste of time and They call me at 6 when they are closed to reschedule the appointment for the day it was supposed to be. Screw everyone that works here but especially the doctors. They are all low budget and have terrible people skills and no organization. They will never get the privilege of getting a dime from me or touching my mouth again. Terrible terrible just terrible experience. Save yourself and find someone else please just keep scrolling.< /Text><date>1605799558297<//date><gmap_id>0x80c2c7a1315d6d83:0x38a19d237b8eaf87</gmap_id><pics>None<//pics></record>

I had a 9 am appointment. It is now 10:30 and I’ve yet to be seen by a anyone. This also happened the last time I was here, which I gave the benefit of the doubt. I also left with a white line across my teeth that was not there before my visit. Not to mention MASSIVE sensitivity that was not pre-existing. Save yourself the trouble of this place and go somewhere else.< /review>

-They were able to schedule me for a cleaning/check up the same day (Monday afternoon).
-Clean, standard looking office
-I was a new patient so I had to fill out some paperwork before.
-The person cleaning my teeth was very gentle!
-The dentist recommended I get a cosmetic procedure, but didn’t give a reason why.  He seemed busy.
- Communication between staff could be better, but overall a good experience.< /review>

<Review>Edit: DO NOT give them your number. It's been several months since I decided to not be seen by them and just this week alone, they've called me 17 times. Also now they're booking appointments that I've made it clear I don't want. If you enjoy relentless spam calls and awful dentist care, then by all means go to West Coast Dental.

I was initially going to see them for a broken crown a few weeks ago. Upon arriving for my appointment, they said it would be approximately an hour wait because although they can only see one patient inside at a time, they're still scheduling like they can have full capacity. The only place to wait was outside in their parking lot with zero social distancing and I was told that if I left to find a less crowded place, then I'd lose my spot. Being that I'm high risk, I left and will never return. I know things are different right now but maybe their wait wouldn't be so bad if they weren't pushing completely elective things on patients. There's a pandemic where they should be limiting patients especially when the patient can't wear a mask while being treated, putting their employees at risk. Instead, even after repeatedly asking them to stop calling, they keep leaving voicemails insisting that I come in for an orthodontic consult or a whitening.< /Review></record></dataset><record>

This place is awful, my mom took my little sister too clean her teeth up some months ago and when she came out she was sobbing with tears, she said the dentist tied her up during they were cleaning her teeth. Another girl came out crying too. Please don’t take your kids to this dentist. It’s horrible, my sister is never coming back to the place, she was traumatized when we left.<//text>

<Rating>2</Rating><Review>-Update: I noticed I was overcharged by $100+ on the bite guard I had rendered services. Paid half up front $225.00, then $100 when I picked them up and on had $125.00 left to be paid off. I was charge for the other half in full, and it took me 4 different staff members to finally be told that I would have to come in person and get my refund approved, which I believe to be unnecessary to further waste my time for their mistake. Very disappointed with my experience - still have not received my refund and or a call back from the management there that said they would call me back with an update. Makes me question if the quality of work I receive is subpar as their front staff. Kindly and respectfully refund me please and thank you! I will not be returning!

This is a great disappointment and not to mention during this risk of a pandemic, there absolutely no regard for the patients time or safety because I really just sat there exposing myself to higher risks. The front desk staff showed hardly any acknowledgement upon arriving as well. The ONLY reason I give one star is because of the nice dental assistant with gelled-back black hair who took my xrays. He was the only one to check in on me and show sincere care, shout outs to you! I wish your fellow staff was more attentive and nice like you. After wasting 2 hours here and told to make a new appointment, I got no apology nor was it acknowledged that they really just played my time. Finding great dental service has been hard and this Western Coast Dental location was just a huge waste of time. I don't recommend unless you have the time of day and don't mind poor service.<//Review>< rating>

I went for a deep cleaning and every single cleaning in the past has been thorough even sometimes needing two sessions to do it right (one for the top one for bottom). This cleaning took about no more than half the time. It felt very rushed, dentist never checked in how I was feeling, and I didn't feel the care as other dentists would. It seemed like they were trying to spend the least time as possible to get paid the same from the insurance company. I would definitely not recommend until they improve their level of care. Other than that, the check In process and front desk staff was very attentive. I liked being able to fill out my information prior to showing up onsite to cut down on the  time.< /Text>

1. The man that took my X-Ray’s touched the plastic, the button, and the drawer consistently and kept putting his hands on the plastic prior to putting it in my mouth. UNSANITARY

2. I scheduled an appointment for a Saturday at 11am. I arrived at 10:58, and by 12:40 after repeatedly asking for a dentist he came and provided MINIMAL insight on anything before leaving the room and never came back. Eventually I left and disrupted services because I still had no cleaning, or no solution. The manager provided an excuse about there only being one dentist present.

3. My X-Rays and personal client information was left on the screen the entire time for every passing eye to see. This was a clear violation of HIPPA regulations. I addressed it and was met with sarcasm, and made it an issue that she would have to put a password in to reopen the screen (that is normal ethical practice).

Overall, I wouldn’t return. Trash experience, and they had no respect for my time.<//Review></record></dataset><record>

<Review>They have been really nice and friendly.  But most importantly they have been efficient, gentle and really patient with me and my mouth has been in bad shape.  I have been to several dentists and West Coast is the first place that has not given me a bad or traumatic experience.  They have a great staff and gladly recommend anyone who needs dental work done to try them.  Did I mention they are fast in scheduling appts.  Remember they are gentle and do quality work.<//Review><Gmap_id>0x80c2c7a1315d6d83:0x38a19d237b8eaf87</Gmap_id>< Pictures>

They are not worried about your health. They will deny your dentals needs and try to get at least $500 out of every visit. I do not recommend this place. They completely messed up on my filling and cost me more than just money. I’ve been examined by multiple dentists and each one has a different input, saying the last one messed up. However, they don’t legally take ownership because that will cost them to much to fix. I wouldn’t recommend this place to my enemy.< /Text>

<Review>Outside of the kind reception, I had a terrible experience here. Everyone felt rushed, and dentists were literally tripping over each other in my room. One hygenist dropped a mouth guard on the ground in front of me and put it back in the drawer without cleaning it. After almost an hour wait I got to talk with a dentist who looked in my mouth for all of 30 seconds before recommending a 1300$ treatment and no explaination, then left never to be seen again. I was rushed to payment where I learned there were parts of the expensive treatment I hadn't been told about included in my bill. No one could explain it. I opted to get a second opinon before paying and was promptly dismissed.

After writing a negative review on a survey they sent me, I was contacted by someone on their HR team, only to be called a liar for my survey review and argued with to come back. I wasn't going to write a review until then.

Stay away from this dentist. They care more about your money than your health.< /Review><pics>None</pics>< Resp>

<review>I usually hate going to the dentist . Not only is it painful but then the cost and the feeling like I'm being cheated. That wasn't the case here . Everyone was so warm and kind. They explained all my payment options and helped me choose the one that made sense to me. I walked away feeling Like I actually came up.  Great service  great experience 10 out of 10<//review>< Pictures>

It's sometimes feels like a never ending search for the right doctor, the right dentist, the right hair dresser etc.. but this dentist is awesome and I can finally check this off my list.

<text>I had an appointment on a Friday, I called them to see if they accommodate me for Wednesday which it was the same day that I was calling them.  They were so good, they accommodated me plus they also gave me a same day appointment for my daughter for the same day as mine. My daughter and I went to see the dentist on the same day and at the same time.  My dentist was so professional and knowledgeable,  big thanks Dr. Shafa🙏🙏🙏< /text><Pics>None</Pics>< rating>

<Text>The LORD GOD ALMIGHTY CHRIST JESUS is very gracious for He gave me West Coast Dental as my personal direct dental provider as my insurance provider referred me to this dental clinic. I was really surprised and amazed by the professional expertise and capability and kindness of its staff starting from their receptionist up to those professionals who attended to me. There was the beautiful lady who conducted my dental x-ray. This was followed by another slim professional in white garment/uniform who put me ay ease while inspecting my gums, teeth & tongue and afterwards, I asked her what will she recommend for me to be done with my teeth. I was truly grateful she did what was appropriate for my dental situation & she was assisted by another professional dental expert while she carefully did the prophylaxis which was painless. After doing her part, thanks to her & her assistant, another male professional did the final dental procedure. Again, my thanks for his professional dental care. The experience was awesome. I wish to thank West Coast Dental for taking the initiative to schedule me for a dental appointment for my own dental health.
GOD ALMIGHTY bless and prosper you.</Text>< pictures>

<Text>I was contacted in advance by email and by phone to confirm my routine appointment for checkup to sign off for orthodontic treatment. Saturday morning I arrived on time, front desk and X-ray technician were very helpful but was told one hour into my appointment that no doctor was available that day due to an emergency. I understand emergencies happen but there is obviously staffing issues that need to be addresses. I’m planning to find other dental solitions if this continues.</Text>< GmapID>

< Review>
If you have an appointment you’ll still be waiting 1+ Hours. Staff is nice. However, the dentists/ surgeons are rude. They’re just trying to finish as fast as possible which means they don’t do their best job. They’re careless in their practice and not careful while in your mouth so expect unnecessary bruises, cuts, and pain.

They’re located in a low-income neighborhood & are aware that majority of patients have medi-cal yet they continue to be extra pushy (ignorantly) pressuring them into paying for extra treatment/ procedures (just to get money) & get mad when you say no. It’s evident that they treat their patients rudely/ carelessly because of their medi-cal status. The dentist/ surgeons expect patients to sign papers before actually explaining to them 1 on 1 the procedure/ risks. Major condescending comments/ replies from dentist/ surgeons when you ask questions. I feel sorry for the Spanish speaking people or people of color who come here because these doctors really have major superiority complex issues.<//Review>

I didn't want to review my experience after my first visit last week but today confirmed just how unpleasant West Coast Dental of 6th street is -- aside from the unreasonable wait time (we're talking hours in the dental chair), the demeanor of certain staff was abrasive and lacking finesse. There was a puddle of water leaking on the floor (on which the dentist commented but no one cleaned up), after the first half of my fillings the doctor left, I was told it'd be another several hours before I'd be seen again (the novocaine was subsiding at this point), and aside from the sweet woman working the X-ray room and the gentleman at the front desk, the employees weren't considerate or attentive. Going to the dentist isn't fun and staff should be trained to speak with kindness, or at the very least, respect.<//text>

<text>Was not packed but the customer service was not great at all. it didn't seem like they would even give me the time of day. I went thru a referral so I traveled farther than usual since I'm not from that area. If I would've known they were just going to blow me off and not even bother look at my situation I would've never bothered and just waited like I'm doing now with a dentist in my area. The dental assistant attending me wasn't courteous at all until my husband stepped up to speak for me which it should never come down to that especially when someone is in unspeakable pain that doesn't allow them to speak. The west coast dental near my area which is van Nuys seemed to be way more helpful and had way better customer service.<//text><pics>None< /pics><response>None</response><GmapID>0x80c2c7a1315d6d83:0x38a19d237b8eaf87< /GmapID></record></dataset><record>

The Doctors are personable, friendly, and very skilled.  The office is very clean and high tech. I am so glad I found it. Such a surprise in such a grubby area.

<text>If a person is a new patient I don't think it would be good to have all the information from insurance ready prior to the appointment.  I filled the paperwork out online at least a week prior to my appointment thinking it would move me along faster but it took 30 minutes.  By the time the X-rays and dentists saw me and finally financial manager to tell me what it'll cost to clean my teeth 2 1/2 hours of waiting, no cleaning yet.  If you put people at the front desk 30 minutes prior to opening people might get seen sooner.  Patients weren't brought back til 9:30</text><response>None< /response>< time>

I am very happy being a patient at West Coast Dental.  They are thorough, work with me on payments, and are genuinely friendly.  I have had three cavities, and a root canal treated there, plus several cleanings, and they have helped educate me on better oral hygiene.  The dentists and the staff are superb.</Text>

<Review>Wow this place is amazing!  So I have a Health Net Provider thru Medi-cal, and don't you know I didn't know I was reassigned dentists, and Wear Coast Dental gave me a phone call on my NEW number btw, and let me know they would be assisting me with my dental needs from now on. We made a quick and easy appointment and and it came with a free "braces"  consultation.  Upon arrival I was greeted with friendly "attractive" professionals and Dr. Monica  was able to do some moderate dental work on me and left me happy.  I rate 5 🌟's< /Review>< Pictures>

<Review>This is the worst place you could go. They're not courteous, organized or professional. They'll be rude. They'll make you wait for hours. They won't look out for your best interest. They're not accessible when you have trouble or get an infection from a bad job done. They only do the bare minimum, which is not even remotely acceptable in regards to oral health. Find somewhere else to go.< /Review><pictures>None</pictures>< Resp>

At first glance this place seems great. The staff is warm and inviting and they provide free parking. The office itself looks clean and modern but this is where the good ends.

I was charged for procedures that were never performed or half performed and the lady in charge of billing for the fees kept insisting on the higher cost options. She comes off as a pushy car salesmen and succeeded in making me feel extremely uncomfortable.

Before beginning the work, the dentist asked if I had considered braces(I have small gaps between my teeth) and said she'd set up a consultation with an orthodontist. During my procedure she began separating my teeth and said that it wouldn't matter since I would be getting braces anyways. Mind you, I had only agreed to the free consultation and never even remotely suggested I was interested in them. Ms car salesmen refused to take no for an answer. Whatever.

To make things worse, I had a cube in my mouth to help keep my jaw open as they worked on filling my cavities the whole time and still they insisted they filled both sides of my cavities. I was also charged for some laser cleaning that was never performed.

I was told I would receive copies of everything I signed but they conveniently had no toner and thus were unable to print them. They promised I'd receive them at my next appointment and surprise surprise, that was also a lie.

A few weeks have gone by since they did the work and the side they performed work on is super sensitive to the point where I am no longer able to chew. Needless to say, this was not the case prior to visiting them.<//review>

The first time I called them to make an appointment I was on hold for 30 minutes. And then I got disconnected. When I finally was able to make an appointment I showed up to the office 20 minutes early, and waited an additional 40 minutes after that.

I left the office I don't think I'll be coming back. Honor your appointments!< /text>

This place is horrible! I went there for a small chip on 1 of my front teeth and the doctor kept on trying to get me to get a veneer when he could have done a way more simple procedure. I end up letting him put the veneer on and a year later it comes off when they suppose to last a minimum of 10 years and they wouldn’t even fix it. They’re tryna make me pay for a whole new one. I hate this place! Do not ever visit this place for dental work! That guy is nothing but a scam artist and cares nothing about your health.</Review>

When I was younger, I had a very traumatic experience with the dentist. Today, I came in, filled out their paperwork, and got sent in. They did x-rays, cleaning of teeth, and filled my cavities. The doctor was very thorough in explaining. I felt calm for the whole procedure. To top it all off, the employees are straight to the point and friendly.< /review>

<text>Excellent.  I felt no pain at all and that is very important to me in a dentist.  All my life I have been terrified of going to the dentist because it has always been a painful experience, until West Coast Dental of 6th Street.  Dr. Monica Lefkot is amazing. My entire treatment was 100% painless. Even the needle was painless.  Dr. Lefkot is kind, reassuring, gentle and showed compassion and understanding about my fears.  The staff took good care of me, as well. Everyone at West Coast Dental of 6th Street is friendly and professional and it's an all around pleasant experience.  Dr. Lefkot was very clear and informative about my treatment and steps moving forward.  I no longer fear going to the dentist as long as I have Dr. Monica Lefkot and the West Coast Dental of 6th Street.  I'm very grateful and I highly recommend West Coast Dental of 6th Street 100% for anyone seeking excellent, painless dental care and treatment.<//text><userid>110917065786585571464</userid><username>Brenda Jeanne Wyche< /username>< Gmap_id>

<rate>2< /rate><text>The falicity is great. However, the person in charged of the team is lacking on customer service and can sound demanding as soon as as one steps in the lobby. That person demonstrated inpatience and unwillingness to help resolve customer questions and did not offer him/her-self to fully explain services recommended/needed. Instead, person jump into selling the service as a product one must buy rather than need. It would be great to see more understanding explanations from this person toward the community who do not speak or know the full dentistry language/procedures/recommendations.

Horrible. Wait time is always so long. The only reason for this place its near home.
Not efficient at all.
Always messing up my appointments.
Get it together.

* Update- It continues, bad customer service. Long waits, even if you have an appointment you'll wait an extra hour. They dont care about their customers. Stay away they're horrible company not organized.

Although the staff are very friendly and accommodating, and the facility clean & in good condition, the  long wait was unexpected. I came to visit my mom in LA from another state to help manage her medical needs/ appointments.
I arrived for the appointment on time but had to wait 1.5 hrs.
My expectation was to have the service within 15 minutes, not 1 1/2 hrs.< /text>

The dentist was great.  The clinic is full service. X-rays, orthodontics, and oral surgery.

The wait time may be long because maybe they don't require that you make a 2nd appointment. They take care of everything right there.

However, the front desk personnel is horrible.  I actually had two (2) people tell me that  I could not get X-rays because I had braces. After several nonsensical sentences, I finally asked if they just did not want to see me as a patient. The whole experience was surreal and cruel.

5 stars for the dentist. 0 stars for the front desk.<//Review>

Worst experience ever! I set an appointment with them for my daughter. I confirmed everything gave them my health insurance via phone the day before my appointment. They said my daughter can come in and she'll be covered. The day we came in they made us full out papers because we're new patient. After 15 mins they told me they couldn't see my daughter because she's not in the roster. I'm like why did you even confirmed my appointment if your just gonna tell me youre not able to see my daughter. And the lady is actually rude and keep insisting that there's no way they can see my daughter. Just don't even come to this facility. You'll just waste your time and you'll encounter this rude lady.</Text>

<Text>I went in for a routine cleaning. The wait was short but after the dentist scanned my teeth for a few minutes, he determined I needed almost $500 dollars of work including 5 fillings and a laser treatment for gum inflammation. I have had a perfect dental record and no cavities since I was in elementary school. I am a dietitian/nutritionist and I eat a healthy diet, low in sugar and have always received positive comments for my dental hygiene from previous dentists and my orthodontist. I declined most of the treatments they wanted me to pay for except for one filling. After paying for it, the staff tells me my dentist is busy with another customer and that I will have to wait an undisclosed amount of time for him to finish up. I decided to leave and find an honest dental clinic.</Text>< Pictures>

This office is horrible. The doctors and management and front desk associates clearly have horrible communication. I waited over an hour for ultimately nothing. A doctor was missing, another doctor said he couldn’t help me without an X-ray after the technician sent me back without an X-ray because I already had recent X-rays. They messed up a filling and seemed entirely unconcerned and apathetic when I returned to have it looked at. Their only concern was that I didn’t express my upset too loudly so that other patients in the waiting room wouldn’t hear about their negligence. I would scream to the rooftops if I could, DO. NOT. GO. HERE.<//review>

<Rating>1< /Rating><text>WORST PLACE EVER! I MEAN EVER AS NOT ONLY DENTIST AS IN ANY COMPANY!!! They first charged me Arm and a leg to get braces and always waited forever even if you have an appointment. The front desk schedule me an appointment so I come on time and the dentist that's not working there anymore forgot his name came to me in front of everyone yells at me like I'm a kid that why I came early so I was trying to tell him why the office schedule me that day but he wasn't listening and kept yelling till someone came and pulled him away. Maybe he got laid off cause of it or not but his he not there anymore .Then I asked for a simple cleaning then dentist said I need a deep cleaning and schedule me a month out. I told them I have my birthday soon so please at least clean the front teeth so I can take picture and didn't get it done cause they reschedule me yet again cause someone messed up on my insurance. Took pictures with my mouth closed SMH. Finally came day to do the cleaning and waited 2 hours after my appointment time and was told don't have time so reschedule me AGAIN! Almost 2 months later time come and they say first need payment first so I said yes I know last visit I was told $250 and now they say it's $600 so I asked why and they said that's what my insurance Co pay is so I asked I was told $250? They said I was told worng information at that point I asked for a manager and sent to worst ever Manger named Araceli she didn't even hear me out and just brushed off everything I said and just kept saying ok it's $600 to do cleaning u want it or not. If u want you can go somewhere else up to you! What kind of Manger is that!! So I repeat led myself and finally she offers a free whitening but was told I need to first pay for cleaning and then wait till I get my braces done and tookin off then I can get it. So I said at this point I want to just move dentist office and she says I can only give u a package whitening so guessing the store cheep version lol! The worst I can't even explain how bad it was into words so I'm done. Guess I'm saying DO NOT GO TO THIS OFFICE!<//text><Pictures>None<//Pictures><Resp>None</Resp>< GmapID>

Why is it 10:30 and I'm still sitting in the waiting room? Why make an appointment, if you aren't staffed to fulfill the appointment. Won't be returning to this location if I have a choice.
Reception staff is fairly friendly, but I will say an unsafe practice used at this facility is the verification of coverage over the phone on speaker phone. Literally heard multiple social security number and birthdays repeated over the phone. Not ok!!!!</Review>< pics>

It should b vise versa. They should get a fee for making us wait long or we should get a 25 dollar discount. This place only cares for their money and not for their patients.

<text>AVOID this Dental place, I switched my kids dentist because they will do anything to get money from you. They took out 5 tooth from my son after being with them for 2 years and suggest he needed braces. Insurance frauds and kids are the one that suffer . 0 🌟< /text>< Pictures>

Awful company. Awful wait time. Incredible that the facility passed their health and safety certification. Dr. Spurgeon is competent, and the 2 nurses I interacted with were quite satisfactory. But avoid this place at all costs.<//text>

<resp>None</resp><text>Free front-door parking, great front desk customer service, video games to play, TV, magazines to read, and English/Spanish fill-out forms provided. No hassle signing up until their doctor turned me away because "they don't accept transfers". I was referred by their corporate in order to get out of my previous horrible local West Dental Center. What was the point of travelling half an hour away if they wouldn't honor the same contract? I even had made an appointment over the phone where they should've let me know then. Nope! Unprofessional/rude is the WC Dental brand. Try a local spot in your area.< /text></record>

The Dentist I saw was straight out of Dental School. She had horrible chairside manners. Was not organized and lacked communication skills which is essential when you are a doctor of any kind.  The upside is that they have a friendly staff.<//text>

Terrible service! Staff will cancel appointments without confirming with you, you won't find out until you arrive. If you call the office, be ready to be put on hold with hopes that they answer the call within 10 minutes. No use in bringing it up to the "manager". Terrible service, parking is bad. Also, if you have an appointment be ready to wait an hour to two hours before they see you. SO MUCH FOR HAVING AN APPOINTMENT< /text>

They are the most unprofessional people!! very rude, no customer, and most of all! The lady who take your payment for the braces. She have no class and no RESPECT.  The one of my problem i have with them. My daughter wear braces before we leave the office we would make appointment for the next visit. We would show up at the office. Those f.....ker look at my daughter and I telling that no one is there to help not only that they tell us that they change the day the doctor would come inside office for braces.

Do not go here. I work in the medical field and I wouldn't usually write a negative review on a medical establishment but I am appalled at how I was treated here. The first time I visited this office they had no idea what they were doing as far as my insurance was concerned, I took the morning off work for my new patient exam and didn't even get in to see the dentist for 4 hours because that's how long it took the front desk to figure out my insurance coverage...only AFTER I called the insurance company myself were they able to get it together. They took my radiographs and I saw a relatively nice male dentist who wanted to talk to me about cleanings, fillings, and braces which is unfortunately not what I was there for. I needed my wisdom teeth removed. They didn't do any work on my mouth that day. They shuffled me into the finance office and Norma proceeded to break down how much oral surgery was going to cost me. She asked me what kind of anesthesia I wanted; what my pain tolerance was? The end result according to Norma was that my procedure including anesthesia would cost $437, and I scheduled it for the following Friday. Fast forward to Friday morning at 7:30am both my girlfriend and I took the day off for my oral surgery. I checked in with the front desk. The receptionist proceeded to ask me how I was being anesthetized? Why they didn't know this already I wasn't sure. I told her that I spoke with Norma at my last appointment and we scheduled sedation and extractions, she told me not to eat after midnight, and to bring someone with me to help me get back home. The receptionist then tells me their financial manager Norma, MISQUOTED me and my procedure was actually going to cost $900. Excuse me? They then proceeded to tell me that it was "okay" because they can finance me...it is NOT okay. They gave a credit for to fill out while I waited 2 hours in the waiting room (starving) waiting for Norma to come in. I DID NOT want their mistake affecting my credit. Norma finally arrived and she admitted to her mistake, said she "assumed" my PPO insurance was going to cover my sedation. I was still liable for $800. We agreed on a payment plan, $430 down and 2 more payments over the next two months, no credit necessary. I went into surgery and came out only to find out that our lovely friend Norma had run my credit while I was asleep after I repeatedly told her not to, told me it was protocol and had me sign all the forms while I was coming out of sedation which I am pretty sure is illegal. Worst experience I've ever had at a medical office of any kind.</review>

I had a great experience. I had wisdom teeth extractions. It was pretty painless. :) Everyone was friendly.
I would give 5 stars. However, I went in expecting intravenious anesthesia, and was given nitrous (laughing gas), instead.

Although the nitrous helped in lessening pain in the procedure, I was still upset. I had already went out of my way to bring a driver, (as required when given deep sedation). I also skipped breakfast and dinner the night before, (as required for deep sedation) (which now that I am restricted to soups for a few days, would have been deeply appreciated; filling up the night and morning before).
And I spent hours on the phone with my insurance to get the deep sedation covered. Only to be given laughing gas at the last minute. :/ So I could've ate, and drove myself.

Sooo, I would still recommend this office to anyone getting the procedure. Everyone was friendly. The surgeon was good. I would, perhaps, just hope there would be more communication in the office, next time, to avoid anymore inconveniences.</text>

<Text>Went in for a regular check up. They told me I had one cavity and needed 3 crowns. I have not had a second opinion yet but the doctor repeated several times this was necessary in an unpleasant manner. I did feel the scare tactics used and acer reading other reviews on yelp I have no doubt that his recommendations were excessive. Live and learn. They prey on weak minded demographic that live in the area.< /Text><username>Robin White< /username><Pics>None< /Pics>< Date>

Terrible place!!!! They overcharge, they make you wait long time for your appointment, they are rude, especially if you do not want to sigh up for an expensive services!

<Review>This is a place where dental assistant orders ur dental treatment, not the doctor. They will take advantage of ur pain and try to make u believe that you have to pay them money, if u  want timely treatments. They will make u believe your dental procedures r not covered by insurance. They make more money when u pay cash than when they claim it from insurance.
Also the staff's get defensive when u ask simple question. U r there to help me understand, right?. Am i missing somthing?<//Review>< Pictures>

Just had my first experience with this office. Very clean and friendly with top of the line equipment. Long wait time in the waiting room followed by xrays then another hour in the dentist chair while overhearing assistants yelling that they need open rooms. TV in both rooms made it more bearable. Then the doctor came in saying I needed 8 root canals and lazer treatment then veneers for my front teeth which had a filling fall out. Now I know I needed alot of work, always having weak teeth I'v had a good feel for any damage and by my judgement theres a good chance I need 1 root canal and 7 cavities taken care of. So not trusting the recommended treatment and not bring covered for most of the work I went for a second opinion.

2nd location I waited less then half the time so a good start. There they recommended 11 cavities be treated and there were 4 possible root canals because they were close. Veneers were suggested as an optional treatment for aesthetics. So basically completely different. Unfortunately I'm not covered by them so I'll have to find a 3 option.

Summary:
Clean/friendly
Long wait
Most expensive but possibly the best long term treatment is strongly suggested.<//text>

I had the most horrible experience in this dentist office on top of the prejudice I waited 45minutes before anyone came into the room to hey kept on saying I will be helped in a  min and this went on for 45 minutes to nail my aunt who was waiting on me came to the back an demanded to o speak to the manager then they he dentist appointment n a very smart tone became sarcastic which made me who was already tired from the hour bus ride to get the here on top of being the here for 2hrs with out being helped it was the worst dentist I’ve been to</Text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad experience, they tell you that you need treatment after treatment when in fact it is not what you occupy, I am not only a dental clinic visited and that is partly good because a second or third option removes your doubts as I do, there is a dentist who It is brutally rude I have a phobia, the work they do in very bad TEA they do against time and that is why it is fatal, I recommend that they seek a second opinion before undergoing any type of treatment in this place, apart from the prisoners are Very high, they take a long time to understand you, they leave you forgotten even for hours and not minutes, I have been a patient for about two years and decided to change places. The dental floss breaks me when cleaning the teeth that treated me, the filling is higher than the other teeth and you tell them they only respond is due to anesthesia. They leave you and go with the next patient, NOT RECOMMENDED !!!!

(Original)
Muy mala experiencia, te dicen que necesitas tratamiento tras tratamiento cuando en verdad no es lo que ocupas yo no solo está Clinica dental visitó y eso en parte es bueno porque saca tus dudas una segunda opción o tercera como lo hago yo , hay un dentista que es brutalmente rudo fobia le tengo, el trabajo que hacen en muy malo TÉ lo hacen contra el tiempo y por eso queda fatal , yo recomiendo, que busquen una segunda opinión antes de someterse a cualquier tipo de tratamiento en esté lugar, aparte los presios están muy elevados , tardan muchísimo en entenderte te dejan olvidado hasta por horas  ya no minutos, yo soy paciente desde hace como dos ańos y e decidido cambiar de lugar . El hilo dental se me despedaza a la hora de limpiar los dientes que me trataron , el relleno me quedo más alto que los demás dientes y les dices solo responden es por la anestesia. Te dejan y se van con el paciente que sigue, NO  RECOMENDADO!!!!< /Text>

(Translated by Google) Very bad service, they leave an appointment for the specialist, they change it when one arrives on time, they say their appointment was changed for tomorrow and they don't notify one until they ask for a day off from work for the moment they don't attend and it's not the first time that They do this then I tell them, make it to me for a Saturday and it says everything is full there is a flame in a month and I have taken the girl for 10 years. I will have to change better.

(Original)
Muy mal servicio le dejan cita para el especialista lo cambian a la hora que uno llega puntual dicen su cita fue cambiada para mañana y no avisan uno hasta pide el día libre en el trabajo para el momento no lo atienden y no es primera vez que me hacen esto luego les digo hagamela para un sábado y dice todo está full hay llama dentro de un mes  y e llevado la niña por 10años tendré que cambiar mejor.<//Text>

<gmap_id>0x80c2c7a1315d6d83:0x38a19d237b8eaf87</gmap_id><Text>(Translated by Google) This was the worst dentist I have ever visited. They pressured me to have expensive procedures that I didn't need and made me wait hours and hours. The service is too slow. They pressure me to do a very expensive deep cleaning, a laser treatment, and a procedure to prevent tooth decay. When I refused the procedure, I was forced to sign an exemption stating that I was not following medical advice. I have never needed an extra deep cleaning in the decades that I have been going to the dentist. I feel so bad for the community and for the people who come because they are being deceived.

(Original)
Este fue el peor dentista que he visitado. Me presionaron para tener procedimientos caros que no necesité y me hicieron esperar horas y horas. El servicio es demasiado lento. Me presionan para que me haga una limpieza profunda muy cara, un tratamiento láser, y un procedimiento que prevenir caries dental. Cuando le rechazé el procedimiento, me obligaron a firmar una exención que indica que no estaba siguiendo los consejos médicos. Nunca he necesitado una limpieza extra profunda en las décadas que he estado yendo al dentista. Me siento tan mal por la comunidad y por la gente que viene porque los están engañando.</Text>< resp>

<Text>I see lots of construction workers and first responders at Ted's, stopping in for a reasonably priced deli sandwich.   Solid lunch fare, good choice of beverages, friendly staff and reasonable social distancing.   Ted's is my go to if I have a teaching break and need a lunch or snack.</Text>< pictures>

I have been going to Ted's Market for almost two years now. Their sandwiches are great, I love their chip selection, their assortment of drinks, and their pre-made salads/foods. This has been a staple for my partner and I since we moved to the Mission.< /Text>

Good sandwiches at good prices. They have your standard cold cuts but also have a rotation of hot sandwiches as well.< /Review>

Teds market is what it’s called and I’m sure at one time it really was a market now it’s actually a deli pretending to be a market I know it sounds harsh. Based on my experience their sandwiches are amazing the staff is always friendly and the store is always clean And well organized. I wouldn’t go there for groceries I would definitely go there for a delicious and amazing sandwich. Sometimes there’s eggs to purchase sometimes there’s not sometimes there’s bacon to purchase sometimes there’s not.
there’s never any bread to purchase and there’s never any cheese to purchase so not a place for basic groceries you’re gonna have to go elsewhere but again the sandwiches are amazing and sometimes their hours are not consistent so maybe call before you go.<//Text>

What can i say,  teds is always a hometown favorite for snacks and sandwiches  !  Been coming here since Ted and Rose ran the place in 1973 i was 8 and my buddy Dave was a teenager, well im glad that Dave kept the store open and still making great sandwiches. I now reside in the south bay, but always make time to stop by when I'm in the city  ! 👍🙂<//Text>

<text>Ted's is always a solid deli.  I usually stop by in the morning for a breakfast sandwich, but honestly all of their sandwiches are great.

Ted's is definitely hidden gem in the neighborhood. Amazing sandwiches, affordable prices and great service; hard to come with this combo in SF. So worth it!</Review>

Looking for a good deli. I was googling a deli place and found this one. So, my brother and I went there. He ordered a breakfast sandwich and I ordered a Black Forest Ham on French Roll. My sandwich was very good and comforting. I enjoyed it. My brother's breakfast sandwich was good if only the bacon could be more crispier. Overall, We both enjoyed our meal and we'll come back again. Thank you.< /text>

Unlike many other deli’s in San Francisco they also have a hot bar and hot sandwiches. They also have some breakfast sandwiches. Prices are reasonable.

The rest of the store has chips, coffee, bottled drinks, gum, etc.< /text>< Resp>

A very well taken care of place of business that makes me proud to be a San Franciscan (if modesty and pride go together) you can tell that the sign has been there for a while, qualifies as at least vintage if not historic, and blends in well with the surroundings.

Don't let that fool you - they run a very tight game and care about what they serve to the community and the merchandise is caught up with modern demand.

You can find all the remedies you need to replenish your gut bacteria (kombucha, yogurt, etc) after a good night out as well as classic junk food items! (Chips, jerky, candy)

Overall, the team goes above and beyond a regular store-n-deli deal and I leave feeling good about spending my money at Ted's!

And for people that LOVE to read:
That combination of modesty and top-notch cutting edge service is a characteristic of true SF places that have been around - respect for the neighborhoods history.
I personally appreciate that because while it is useless to resist the inevitable and everyone has their own past - our children will have to share the future.
Sort of a reminder to avoid judging the book by its cover and to remember what you're stepping on, because once it's gone - it's gone!</Review>

This place is fantastic, a hidden GEM. In SOMA's ocean of $14+ sandwich places, this place not only sells a veritable smorgasbord of preposterously fresh sandwiches for less than you'd pay at Subway, but the guy who runs the place is the friendly sort of neighborhood shop owner you rarely see outside of old movies. He actually seems to know his customers, and the staff is similarly cheerful. After I ordered a meatball sub on Dutch crunch bread (the freshest and best I've ever had), the owner asked if I'd had one from them before. Learning I hadn't, he gave me a big stack of napkins and a fork with a knowing "You're gonna need these". A+ for the kind of customer attention I'm sure it's not easy to keep up all day. From the sign street it looks like a typical corner shop, but it's definitely not. Give this place all your sandwich-related business. And they sell booze too!</review>

WEDDING CATERING - I just attended a wedding at which Ted's Deli catered the food for 150 guests.  On top of the over-the-top customer service of David delivering the order himself, Ted's selected a menu that required no heating or refrigeration for the short duration between delivery and serving time which certainly helped with the logistics and clean up.   David provided tips on the presentation of the beautiful sandwich, salad and appetizer trays, leaving the serving crew very confidant.  The family and guests were delighted with the food and ate every bite by the end of the party.  I give Ted's Six Stars if they were an option!< /review>

I have tried much of their deli menu but absolutely nothing beats the Club Ted in my opinion. Friendly staff, huge delicious sandwiches, Ted's is the best.

On two separate occasions I've had people stop me during my lunch break just to ask where I got my sandwich from because they look so delicious.< /text>

Just a heads up to the owner....   The new web site looks nice.  Unfortunately the "fax in your order sheet" no longer exists.  This was the way my guys would order from you on the weekends, it works for us because with 12 - 18 people working it is too hard to build an "online order".   Just my two cents.   Thanks!!!  Also there is no email address for you on the web site, otherwise I would have just sent this to you directly.<//Text>

<text>Terrific family owned business. I don't need to tell you about the great sandwiches, there are over 400 reviews and over 100 pictures in their honor.
But catering for a party is great too!
I ordered ahead and picked up 98 sandwiches, 6 salads, and 11 chilled cases of soda and water.
Other guests brought coolers with ice, paper plates, etc., and it was an instant success.
127 people showed up (more than planned), and everyone was so impressed that I was tempted to tell them that my wife and I made the sandwiches. (But I couldn't take credit for making them, just finding them on Yelp)
Next year: More sandwiches and more people< /text><user>104420490286031700880</user></record>

They also have breakfast and vegetarian sandwiches. A deli with a lot of variety! You can't go wrong. Friendliest and nicest staff ever.< /Text>< Gmap_id>

Its Unfortunately that this little deli is off the walking path for most people visiting this little area on Howard street. The employees are great and attentive to your needs/request. Presentation and flow of the place is adequate for its size. The only draw that I saw was the fruit display was some what disappointing. Otherwise, if your in the neighborhood, the sandwiches on the menu are well worth it.< /text>

New favorite sandwich/deli place. Super local vibe so it's usually frequented by cops, construction workers, mechanics from the neighborhood body shops... staff is always friendly and DAMN do they know how to make a good sandwich.

I go back and forth but right now a Rich Boy (3-4 diff kinds of Italian meats) on a fresh sourdough roll is my favorite (sorry roast turkey!!)</Review>

Ted's sandwiches are pretty great. For 7 dollars this thing is stacked. It's not a deli board experience but it's pretty great. I'm a regular here for lunch. They're ingredients arent the highest quality but whatever. It's a 4 meat sandwich for 750. You cannot beat that.</Review>

One of the best places to get a sandwich in the Civic Center/Van Ness area of San Francisco. The line could take a while during lunch (be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes if not more, as you'll have that many people in front of you if you're there around 12 noon). The line fairly moves quickly though and then you get a fully loaded sandwich (assuming you get everything on it), and real turkey as an option instead of deli turkey if you're into eating turkey.

No place for sitting down, so it's all about the food on this place. Great tasting sandwiches costing around $7 as of writing can't be beat!</text>

Ted's is not for everyone, but I really enjoy spending time there. The owner is incredibly nice and friendly, and truly treats you like family.

The food is quite good and the prices more than fair. Ted's has lots of cool sports memorabilia decorating the walls, and the place was recently remodeled into a sports bar feel. There's a high-def TV every which way you look, and cozy booths as well so you can enjoy it with a medium sized party.

Because it's a family-run establishment, service tends to be a bit slow, but the experience is still great because the servers are so personable. I really liked their wings (although spicier than I expected), and the cheeseburger and fries are a strong classic.< /Text>

Sandwiches are huge and a great deal for lunch in downtown SF. Quality could be better though... I have yet to be really excited about something I've ordered here. Quite the diverse menu though, I'll keep searching..<//Text>

First of all, kudos for coming up with the obviously fitting name!  Secondly, you backed up the innovative name with innovative food!  In the world of fusion, Korean and Mexican works fine for me!<//Text>

Some of the best sandwiches in the Bay Area.  I would highly recommend visiting this establishment.  Make sure your in there by 11 or after 1.  It gets really busy during lunch time.< /Review>

Great food, lots of choices, friendly staff, big portions, good value and always a line.  Ted's is an awesome market where you can get wonderful sandwiches (or salads) made to order or pick up one of their smaller pre-made items.  They also carry snacks (healthy and not healthy), alcohol, soda, and other various drinks.< /text>

<text>Very good bang for buck (SF standards!)
Tried the Tri-tip (M,W,F only) and was pleasantly surprised! Not overcooked or anything, just right!
Only complaint is that the line gets way too long... and when i'm hungry i want to buy everything around me in that market so 4 stars for making me having to practice self-restraint.
Will definitely be coming back.</text>< username>

<Text>Nice sandwiches! Probably would want to order a bit more if you have a large stomach :P. If you are gonna order online for lunch, make sure to order early before 11 since they don't take online order after that; there are generally people lining up during lunch time.<//Text><pictures>None</pictures><resp>None< /resp>< GmapID>

<Review>Like most bigger urban cities, you never know what youre going to get when you walk into a random place. From the outside Teds looks like any other convenience store. Turns out this is one of the more well regarded joints in the city. Unfortunately i came a bit late and they were cleaning up the deli area. Got some snacks and beverages for the road. Looks like ill have to come back for the real reason, the sandos.<//Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><Response>None< /Response><Gmap_id>0x808f7e277b7d3ce5:0x3efd007a2bbfc62< /Gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

Absolutely delicious.  Leftovers enough for supper.  OLd Review: This was my first time going to this longstanding deli.  I had the Reuben sandwhich.  Portion size was perfect for lunch.  The pastrami, sauerkraut, cheese special sauce on dark rye was the best i have had in sf.  Def will be going back to try their wide variety of classic sandwhiches.  Line looks long at lunch but goes very fast.  Order, pay and grab ur sandwhich all made fresh.  😋 Yummy!!!  Update.  I had a salad today and it was fantastic.  Chunks of veggies guac etc.  Enough for two meals unless really hungry.<//Review>< pics>

It is hard to find a classic family owned deli in this city but if that's what you're looking for Ted's is your place.  Make sure to try the curry chicken salad!< /Review>

<text>This location of Garvey Ranch Park Observatory is kinda odd in Monterey Park that I happened to find it through Google Maps!  Very luckily, it opens in Wednesday evening at 7pm — the same day when I just found out this small observatory.  Wonderful!  Must return in the weekend’s afternoon when it is opened.  Yay!<//text><Pics>[{'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipOyxl7dozg7A_XsAhz_O6NFdpbdszJRLwMEk0xu=w150-h150-k-no-p']}, {'url': ['https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p/AF1QipNPg2wF2PSqUKO0hqeTEuuj1i-5sZBLlFB8BkbS=w150-h150-k-no-p']}]<//Pics>< Response>

Very informative and interesting and educational place to visit. You can learn a lot about everything relating to astronomy from planets and moons to stars, black holes and galaxies. Definitely worth visiting since it's not as crowded as Griffith observatory and you can make requests for what you would like to see.</text>

<Text>It's located within the park and is open on weekends. Good place for the observatory as it is in an open space away from cars but located in a residential area. Residents can go there all the time.<//Text>< pictures>

It's very cool, but one time I accidentally moved the telescope when I was looking at a planet, and this man got angry with me. The park overall is my, a bit crazy and fun, childhood.<//text>

<Text>Nice clean park for a Birthday Party. Parking is limited. Restrooms rooms near by. THREE stars only, Restrooms were dirty. Restrooms need to be cleaned and kept cleaned and supplied .  Restrooms need to be updated. Take your own toilet paper, paper towels, toilet seat covers, soap. Play area available.</Text><pics>None</pics>< response>

< review>
Interesting presentation displays of local historical events early in the days when Monterey Park developed.  Including the starts of well-known names like Laura Schudders.
Other exhibits highlight collections of Monterey Park Historical Society

* I would like to see much more specifically about the significance of the actual Observatory itself.
Pertaining to "hobbies" of the wealthy, there's a rich history to tell of the many influential persons in the history of Los Angeles and Southern California who's interests, studies and wealth contributed to the advancement of significant astronomical and scientific discoveries.
-- From Griffith Park, Mount Wilson, Saddle Back, Palomar, JPL, CalTech... many peoples involved within and around the San Gabriel Valley.<//review>

<Rating>4<//Rating><Text>Fast service. When you drive up they instantly help you and answer any questions you may have. Calling over the phone can help, but the lady on the phone doesn't speak English very well. When you drive up, someone who does speak English helps you out and is super helpful! And they have affordable tires! Definitely recommending this place to my friends in LA who need a quick tire change.< /Text>< user_name>

I would give them 5 stars, if they did alignment on lowered cars.  If you drive anything factory spec, this is the place for you.  They do awesome work and offer fair prices for installation.  4/5 stars!< /Text>

<review>Dishonest and just plain rude. Came here with tears in my eyes asking if they can patch my tire just enough for me to get home. There was a small hole causing a little bit of air to leak, the receptionist came out and said no fix I must replace the tire. So the tire technician didn’t even look at my tire. I told him that’s fine but if he can just patch it so I can get home & my dad can have a look at it. Said no and insisted i get a new tire. Since he refused to fix it, I left. Obviously leaving upset he saw that I began to cry and he turns to the other receptionist and starts laughing. HOW UNPROFESSIONAL and POS do you have to be to laugh at someone who is already upset?? I went down the street to Fernando’s Tired and he fixed my tire for $10 and said I can still drive it until I have the $$$ to fix it. So they basically just tried to scam me. He saw a was a young girl who didn’t know much about cars so he tried to take advantage . Take your business elsewhere !< /review><Name>Valeria Hernandez</Name><response>None</response>< gmap_id>

<Text>What a great experience! Came in stressed out and in need of one tire just to get back on the road, left happy and safe with two new replacements for cheap used tires that I was scammed on. Plus a little extra that I noticed but wasn’t mentioned by the owner who did a nice thing just to do it. It changed my whole day and they have a life long customer because of it.

I like this shop! They sell tires as well but i primarily come here for alignment. For my particular car, a 2015 Toyota Camry they charge $55 which is fixed. I have called in several times over the months at different times of the day to see if their price would fluctuate but no it remains constant. This was my third time for alignment with them. A small shop with a few chairs and benches for seating, no frills but very professional people.< /review>

Very good local spot. I've been coming here for about 5 or 6 years. They're quick, affordable, and will usually give you a discount if you pay cash, since it's not a big chain.</Text>

Ordered some aftermarket rims and a set of new tires. Got them mounted, balanced, alignment, and set of lug nuts for a great price. They will order what you want and suggest other tires just from their tire knowledge. No pressure in buying what they have in stock versus what you want as well. Great service, and they open weekends.<//Text>

<text>This is my go-to tire shop.  I went in to VItness to get one of my tires checked out - it had a screw in it.

Once I parked in the garage, the owner came out to inquire about the service I needed.  I told him about the screw in the tire and he said that because the screw was on the side of the tire, there was nothing that could be done to repair it.

FYI- if you get a screw/nail in your tire, that tire is reparable only if it is on the thread (middle of the tire).  If it is on the side, it is not reparable and a new tire is needed.

I verified this information using my smart phone - hey you never know...I certainly didn't.

The guy said he'd pull it out with the hope that just on the surface and hence no replacement would be needed.  Alas, that was not the case, as when he started pulling the screw out, the tire started deflating.

The unfortunate thing is I had just replaced my tires no more than a year ago - still lots of miles to go.

The entire replacement of my tire was $85 including tax.  Overall, the service was done professionally and quickly.  I was in/out in 20 minutes.</text><Pictures>None< /Pictures>< userid>

Maybe the best tire place I've been to.  Incredibly honest and super nice.  Got exactly what I needed for less than I thought it would be.  I live 90 miles away and will time any tire purchases for when I'm here.</review>

< Review>
A pretty decent church, I'd say. Looks nice, and is pretty spacious.
My biggest complaint however, lies with the pastor for the 5pm English session(s). His accent is VERY heavy, which makes it hard to understand what he's trying to say. I at most could pick out 2-3 words at a time, often leaving me wondering what exactly he was trying to preach.
Also, while not nearly as hindering, this church doesn't have air conditioning. They open the windows, but it still leaves the room kinda warm. I just figured I should mention it for those with a sensitivity to heat.</Review>

I came to visit the Blessed Sacrament, and I found out that at his chapel, they have the most adorable image of our Lady brought from Europe that should be exposed as well in the main church.
A complete piece of Art, that in my consideration is hidden from the world in that small chapel.
If you are in the vicinity of El Segundo, PLEASE STOP by this chapel and enjoy a jewel of the Sacred Art, assure you that you won't be dissapointed!!!!</text>

I sometimes attend Mass and Pastor Robert is an excellent priest and the staff are very helpful.  I also attend retreats a couple times a year which are very informative.  They always have excellent speakers.<//text>

<Review>If you're looking for a very good orthodox teaching in Catholicism this is the place to be.  Fr. Robert is a great shepherd of the flock along with the associate priests.  We cannot thank them enough for their priesthood and their ministry.  These men are great gifts to the community.
Also, for Catholics who have plenty of questions to their faith, there's the bible study every Monday at 7pm in the parish center.  You will love our Lord even more as you know Him.  If we only realize it, there is not enough time in this life to fully know our GOD.  No room for boredom if you walk with the Lord and plenty of work and learning to be done to fulfill our mission and to proclaim our Lord's glory.  :)< /Review>< Name>

I disliked this church. I dislike Catholicism. The penance was always the same: 6 Hail Mary's and 6 Our Father's. It was the same homily and pattern week after week after week. I got nothing out of attending here. I happily fell away. Perhaps it has been jazzed up since I went in the 1980s. I hope so. Oh, I did like Pentecost Sunday when we all got decked out in red. I did like the Christmas and Easter services.<//Text>

Been here to attend a baptism of my friend's daughter. It's nice clean church. Conducive for prayer and meditation. Parking seems small for its parishioners.< /Text>

<Review>This is one of few churches in the South Bay where you will find a Latin Mass.  Every 2nd and 5th Sunday of the month at 1:30pm after the Spanish Mass.  Also, they just hired a new principle for the school that is very Catholic and wants the children to learn their Catholicism.  A diamond in the rough parish that you must check out.</Review>< pictures>

There’s always anxiety when you have to go to urgent care but the Sharp-Rees Sorrento Mesa staff made that all go away. Everyone made me feel at-ease and comfortable. My attending nurse (Cristina) was an expert on her technical skills (ECG, Blood drawing, etc..) and also very caring. The X-ray lab technician knew her stuff and made sure I was comfortable throughout the whole process. My attending physician (Dr. Tipler) made me feel I was her only patient. She was focused and asked many questions regarding my condition. Overall, it was a pleasant experience that day at Sharp Sorrento Mesa. I highly recommend this urgent care provider.</Review>

Best kept secret in San Diego. This Urgent care is the best. The staff and doctors are amazing, almost no wait time. They are thorough in their diagnosis and have all kinds of lab test and xrays Available on site. they even offer to give you a copy off all your tests results if you need them. Bonus, I got two warm blankets to keep me cozy while waiting between tests / results. Dr Dozzi is very knowledgeable and personable. Highly recommend</review>

I checked into urgent care and the receptionist was really helpful. I didn’t wait long. The doctor I saw was very helpful and gave some great tips to help me with my pain. I needed X-rays and the technician that came for me was also really nice. Good visit overall.< /review>

At 57 years old, I have seen my fair share of doctors.   I am in good health and have always received fairly good care.  But, I can tell you, the doctor that I saw at Sharp was absolutely the best.

After experiencing a minor vision incident, my wife insisted that I go to a doctor. Having no doctor available within the system, I visited the urgent care area at Sharp. I was assigned Dr. Karen Tipler.

From the moment the doctor started to assess my situation, I had the confidence that she was really analyzing the situation and doing a thorough examination.  She asked pointed questions and explained her reasoning - all the while methodically eliminating possible diagnosis which she was clear was not the cause.

When all was said and done, I left the care center with a full body of blood work, a full eye examination and a referral to another specialist as a further precaution.

Later that evening the Dr. personally called me as a follow up to our conversation.  After having already believed she had afforded me great care, she had no idea how appreciative I was that she did that follow up.  It further convinced me that Dr Tipler was a cut above the rest.

This is a Dr. that truly cares about her patients, has a wide range of knowledge and takes her time to make sure she gets it right.

Sharp likewise has a comprehensive system designed to give total care.</review>

This was the best urgent care/ health care experience I have ever had. Both my nurse and doctor, Gina and Dr. Tantod, deserve 10 stars for their skill, efficiency, warm & caring energy, and superb communication with patients. Even an extra perk of having a toasty warm blanket delivered to me when I was chilly in the bed. They cared about my comfort and it showed. I would highly recommend this urgent care facility to anyone in this area.</review>

It is the follow up instructions that has frustrated me. I was told to book an appointment with orthopedics the next morning. When I called I was told that Sorrento Mesa doesn’t see hands. I needed to call a place (unnamed) where Sorrento Mesa refers hands to. I called this office & got punted to new patients who made me leave a message. They would get back to me when the could. Lack of sleep because of my pain is fueling my anger. I should have been directly referred to the hand specialist.</Review>< response>

<Text>I was with extreme discomfort from having ear pain...most noises and my own voice were vibrating and causing me to have a bad headache.
Obviously I didn’t know Sharp Rees Stealy does in fact provide Urgent care services everyday of the week including Sundays because I had relied on Google’s expertise and it would say CLOSED.
Well... I called and when Trisha answered my phone call ...I was in heaven... she was helpful and so compassionate. Once there Dr. Scott took care of my issue and even showed me an image of why my ears were in pain.

Thanks to all who helped me feel better 😊</Text><gmapID>0x80dc07648cfeab9b:0xf067f1a1b8676fc9< /gmapID>< date>

The total experience was great from the time we pulled into the parking lot. Dr. Chan was amazing, as well as the nurse who treated me, taking the time to understand what was wrong and getting my treatment in place.  One of my best medical clinic experiences ever. Thanks to the entire Sharp Rees-Stealy staff whom I interfaced with< /Text>

<review>I got a contact stuck in my eye and scratched my eyeball out due to trying to get it out and Dr. Paula Dozzi was so patient and gentle as she thoroughly examined my eye and made sure all of the pieces of the contact were out. She made sure I was going to get my antibiotic eye drop prescription that same night and explained to me how to use it. I came in an hour before closing and the nice man up front and the RN got me in right away.<//review>< pics>

They were amazing! Had a little chopping mishap in the kitchen. A few stitches, lots of laughs and positivity saved my date night. In and out in under an hour. Thanks Sharp!!!<//text>

<Review>Not a place for babies. Nurse spent several minutes and multiple attempts to take vitals. Doctor confessed he couldn’t see through the right ear but didn’t attempt more. Not received a visit report at the end but ER referral to children’s hospital.Disappointed and regretted for visiting this place.

Note: This is a review specific the urgent care not Sharp Rees-Stealy in general.</Review></record>

I came here in order to avoid Scripps (worst medical group) and have found my new medical group. The nurses and assistants were all welcoming and put me at ease. The doctors all took the time to understand my situation and to listen to my concerns. I didn’t feel rushed at all and getting in contact with them afterwards hasn’t been a problem in the slightest. Please come here before going to scripps !!!< /Text>

From check in to leaving the entire experience was very pleasant. I’m always impressed by Sharp’s ability to make my visits quick yet efficient. I had never been to this urgent care before but the physician and nurse were very welcoming and quick to call me with test results same day.< /Review>

My recent visit to Urgent Care was extremely good experience. They followed the COVID rules to the T. The admission procedure was effortless and both the attending nurse and physician [Dr. Gary Gluck] were phenomenal. The doctor did required testing and exam, and was clear about diagnosis and what I need to do. Any time I have had to seek Urgent Care, my experience had been very positive--staff and doctors are qualified and caring. Excellent care! Very strongly recommend.<//Text>

<text>Almost all the staff were great, but I had a weird interaction with one of them and wonder if it was the reason for an increasingly miserable hour + wait right in front of the check-in desk on a very slow day (supervisor came in to apologize that nobody came out to get me, saying it was unprofessional,  but I never learned what happened). It was the cherry on top of an awful week, but I let it go and didn't give it much thought afterward.

When the bill came, I saw they had run and billed for a pregnancy test without asking. I called billing and was told it was "standard procedure." It was not possible for me to be pregnant, any my symptoms weren't pregnancy-related, so the test was pointless. It took some persistence over the phone with a manager to take that charge off of my bill.

It wasn't the worst thing in the world, but I'll be going out of my way to find a different urgent care next time.< /text><pics>None</pics><Resp>{'time': 1577381397487, 'text': 'Hi M Perkins,\n\nWe apologize for your negative experience and appreciate your feedback.

I have been to this urgent care on a couple of occasions.  Being a 34 year nurse with 25 years in the ICU I am pretty particular about my healthcare and my providers.  Even if I was not a Sharp Nurse I would still come here for my urgent needs.  The place is so well organized, the staff are so courteous and respectful from the admit clerk to the Physician.  The wait is reasonable and comfortable chairs are provided.  It has everything you would need for them to make a diagnosis and treat you. I would HIGHLY recommend this facility.< /text>

<review>The office/staff etc was good but BEWARE of insurance issues.  they made me pay upfront and then follow up with my insurance to get a refund.  I had to be ridiculously diligent - called the billing office 10 times over 5 months to get refund check in my hands.  Never any issue about the fact that they indeed owed me $200, just an approach that seemed they would hope i would forget - i don't believe they  ever had any actual intention of cutting me a check,</review><Gmap_id>0x80dc07648cfeab9b:0xf067f1a1b8676fc9</Gmap_id><Time>1540543224255< /Time>< pictures>

Went to the Urgent Care department and was pleasantly surprised at how everyone was so nice in the department. I was actually accompanying a family member and didn't deal with any of the nurses, although I also received very good feedback from them too, but the Front Desk staff was great, especially Annette and Sheryl. They had noticed that I had been waiting for a while for my family member to come back out from care and they asked me if I was okay. When I asked if there was a vending machine (I was starving and on the verge of fainting!!!!!), instead of telling me that there wasn't any on site for customers they took me to the employee lounge. Also, I didn't have any change on me, just my debit card but Annette and Sheryl didn't hesitate one bit to buy me something from the machine. It's those little gestures that make all the difference in customer service and I wanted to make those ladies noticed! hopefully this comment will go to management.
I would like to thank those ladies again for their great service and genuine kindness but also recommend this great Urgent Care facility.< /text>

<Review>Patient using urgent care... unfortunately I get to visit urgent care more often than I'd like. I've visited many over the years. I just moved to the neighborhood and was worried about where I would need to go and what type of service I would get there. I was pleasantly happy with my experience and if needed again (sorry but this is where I'm crossing my fingers that I don't) I'll be coming back here.<//Review>< pictures>

Need to get a Hep B vaccine for my new position so went to Sharp Rees-Stealy Occupational Medicine department. The staff on the front desk were very friendly and arranged a lab test quickly. Again, the lady on the front desk of lab was nice. Waiting time was less than 10 min. However, the staff who took my blood was unfriendly. No smiles, no greetings, no thanks, no whatsoever. Seems she just wanted to get me out asap. By the way, there was no one after me, so I don't know why she rushed so much. Maybe she happened to be in a bad mood that day, but feeling unwelcome when I left was not what I expected. This is why I give 3 stars.<//Text>

Installation took forever. They only do Pioneer and Kenwood. So we ended up with a player that's impossible to fast forward and very difficult to remove. Not thrilled.</text>

<Review>My parents and I get our phones here, and theyve always been so helpful and respectful. Definitely will answer any questionz you may have, and will explain rhe process of something if you ask about it, or how to do it (example; such as transferring photos from on phone to another)
They've always been so efficient, and patient. They have items from car steros, to phone cases, new phones, insurance plans, Etc. They're a wonderful business, and will have you in and out in roughly and your or less (depending on what your there for)<//Review><Pics>None< /Pics><resp>{'time': 1565048024187, 'text': 'Thank you for supporting our business.'}<//resp><gmap_id>0x80db65f9471699b5:0xf6a388c9469fd316</gmap_id></record></dataset><record>

<review>Customer service is great. They never try to rush you into any decision. They take the time to answer any and all questions.
They stand by their products and their work. I recommend them for all your car needs.< /review>< pictures>

We have a new RV and couldn't get the satellite dish to work.  We called Tony and he came out to where we were camping and worked for over an hour to find the problem. (bad component)  He was polite, eager to find a solution and more than fair on the price.<//Text>

Manager will not help replace a defective phone after purchasing a month later. Poor costumer service and return policy not worth the money if you purchase a high end phone.Dont recommend these idiots!!!</text>

Gotta love these guys.  Sure they do cell phones and car stereo, but they are so much more than that.  I was having troubles with my RV satellite system and it did not become apparent until the morning I was scheduled to take off. Well, I may have been delayed, but Tony got me back on the road in less than an hour.  Honest service.  A company that stands behind their work.  Can't imagine going anywhere else.</review>

<user>105508445309573181949< /user><Text>Recently bought some after-market driving lights and many auto shops were reluctant to wire them up.   One shop suggested a stereo specialist which I hadn't even thought of. Pro Inet is that and much more. With newer cars having all kinds of computer systems and air bag technology, the average Joe is going to be in over his head trying to wire almost anything. Scott at Pro Inet said "no problem" and that they were  busy ( a good thing ) but to come by in a few days and they'd take care of it. C J , the tech guru, made it seem like a walk in the park to wire the lights. I could have spent all day on it and probably would have lit up the air bags along with crashing the computers while it took him about 45 minutes to wire up a very clean job. These guys know their stuff. Any electrical in the future, they'll be my first call.</Text><Time>1439045854128</Time><name>Tom Austin<//name><Resp>None</Resp></record>

Took a 20 mile bicycle ride here from Wilshire/Vermont redline station and didn't expect the outdoor dining to be shut down. The food was good though and the fries were fresh out of the fryer. I had to be sneaky and utilize one of the outdoor tables to eat. This would be a 4 star if the outdoor dining was open. One more star if the area wasn't infested w/ meth heads running around w/ no shoes or sleeping at the nearby bus stop bench in the middle of the day. I saw at least 3 of them during my visit here.<//Text>

I used to love coming here but now it has gone downhill. For a place that is supposed to have a fast drive thru, they don't. Even with no one in line. The building is dilapidated, speakers don't work, the facade of the building is falling off. The owner of the franchise should be appalled. Then they have the audacity to charge you 40 cents for a ranch or any other sauce... When the order you bought is chicken bites?!! Sadly I will not be returning.</review>

<text>The food is always good, the fact that their customer service is bad it just makes you not want to go back. Im assuming the manager was the one that took my order over drive thru.  He doesnt let you finish your order just tells you to pull foward, i told him to give me a sec. He just stood quiet and turned off the headset, i had to say "hellooo" like 5x. Once at the window. i handed him my debit card and he didnt even try to reach out for it, gave me my food and slammed there window. Horrible. You should quit if your not happy with your job.< /text><Pics>None< /Pics>< response>

<Review>First off, the Rally Fries are one of a kind deliciousness! If you haven't tried it, its a must!! They have Good simple food that wont disappoint. The prices are pretty economical and they always have deals to offer you! They have Burgers, chicken bites, mozzarella sticks, chicken wings, koolAid slushies and soft serve ice cream. That's why YOU HAVE TO TRY THE WICKED STRAWBERRY SOFT SERVE!! Amazing!! Cant wait to have it again!< /Review>< Pictures>

Food is good and great price as well. Not overpriced but just right. The chicken sandwich is done right here. Love that they are open late too for a quick pass by.<//Review>

This is the one place I go to for some amazing. Late night snacking versus eating the usual type of food such as McDonald’s. Definitely worth eating here at night for they have some benches and tables.<//Review>

Really great spot to eat has fast and cheap but good food you can get some great deals however I have noticed that once in a while the quality does drop but I still enjoyed the food would be a five star were it to always be a consistent quality. I recommend the mango island slushie< /review>

I spent almost 15 minutes in the drive thru and the cashier didn't even apologize for it. It was after midnight and there was just 1 car in front of me. I would have left but there was a car behind me.
They also forgot my dressing ketchup and missing one of my burger.
Horrible service absolutely terrible. I don't think Im going back.< /Text>

<Review>Well my experience I really wasn't that great we arrived and there was a long line drive through her therefore we decided to get out of the car and ordered when we got there and we were ordered over to connect 45 to 55 minutes to be done our food was done plus we wanted to sit down and eat and when we wanted to download table for 30 the trash cans are overflowing with trash really bad expectations for this place</Review>< Resp>

Then I just went across the street to the little market on the other side of florence to buy a soda for a dollar ten and I filled up on three dollars and thirty something cents :)
The burgers are about medium size but they're good and will fill you up. The fries taste really good.< /Review><Pictures>None< /Pictures><resp>None</resp>< gmap_id>

The food is pretty good. But Do not dine in on the outside patio, because the pigeons don't let you eat comfortable and aren't scared of people and get really close to you and don't get frightened when you scare them.< /review>
